<text>A pendulum is a device made of a weight suspended from a so that it can swing freely. When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting, equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position. When released, the restoring force acting on the pendulum&#x27;s mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position, swinging back and forth. The time for one complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the period. The period depends on the length of the pendulum and also to a slight degree on the amplitude, the width of the pendulum&#x27;s swing.

The regular motion of pendulums was used for timekeeping and was the world&#x27;s most accurate timekeeping technology until the 1930s. The pendulum clock invented by Christiaan Huygens in 1656 became the world&#x27;s standard timekeeper, used in homes and offices for 270 years, and achieved accuracy of about one second per year before it was superseded as a time standard by the quartz clock in the 1930s. Pendulums are also used in scientific instruments such as accelerometers and seismometers. Historically they were used as gravimeters to measure the acceleration of gravity in geo-physical surveys, and even as a standard of length. The word &quot;pendulum&quot; is Neo-Latin, from the Latin , meaning .

== Mechanics ==

=== Simple gravity pendulum ===

The &quot;simple gravity pendulum&quot; is an idealized mathematical model of a pendulum. This is a weight (or bob) on the end of a massless cord suspended from a , without friction. When given an initial push, it will swing back and forth at a constant amplitude. Real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag, so the amplitude of their swings declines.

=== Period of oscillation ===
The period of swing of a simple gravity pendulum depends on its length, the local strength of gravity, and to a small extent on the maximum angle that the pendulum swings away from vertical, &quot;θ&quot;0, called the amplitude. It is independent of the mass of the bob. If the amplitude is limited to small swings, the period of a simple pendulum, the time taken for a complete cycle, is:

where formula_1 is the length of the pendulum and formula_2 is the local acceleration of gravity.

For small swings the period of swing is approximately the same for different size swings: that is, &quot;the period is independent of amplitude&quot;. This property, called isochronism, is the reason pendulums are so useful for timekeeping. Successive swings of the pendulum, even if changing in amplitude, take the same amount of time.

For larger amplitudes, the period increases gradually with amplitude so it is longer than given by equation (1). For example, at an amplitude of &quot;θ&quot;0 = 0.4 radians (23°) it is 1% larger than given by (1). The period increases asymptotically (to infinity) as &quot;θ&quot;0 approaches π radians (180°), because the value &quot;θ&quot;0 = π is an unstable equilibrium point for the pendulum. The true period of an ideal simple gravity pendulum can be written in several different forms (see pendulum (mechanics)), one example being the infinite series:
formula_3
where formula_4 is in radians.

The difference between this true period and the period for small swings (1) above is called the &quot;circular error&quot;. In the case of a typical grandfather clock whose pendulum has a swing of 6° and thus an amplitude of 3° (0.05 radians), the difference between the true period and the small angle approximation (1) amounts to about 15 seconds per day.

For small swings the pendulum approximates a harmonic oscillator, and its motion as a function of time, &quot;t&quot;, is approximately simple harmonic motion:
formula_5
where formula_6 is a constant value, dependent on initial conditions.

For real pendulums, the period varies slightly with factors such as the buoyancy and viscous resistance of the air, the mass of the string or rod, the size and shape of the bob and how it is attached to the string, and flexibility and stretching of the string. In precision applications, corrections for these factors may need to be applied to eq. (1) to give the period accurately.

A damped, driven pendulum is a chaotic system.

=== Compound pendulum ===

Any swinging rigid body free to rotate about a fixed horizontal axis is called a compound pendulum or physical pendulum. A compound pendulum has the same period as a simple gravity pendulum of length formula_7, called the &quot;equivalent length&quot; or &quot;radius of oscillation&quot;, equal to the distance from the pivot to a point called the &quot;center of oscillation&quot;. This point is located under the center of mass of the pendulum, at a distance which depends on the mass distribution of the pendulum. If most of the mass is concentrated in a relatively small bob compared to the pendulum length, the center of oscillation is close to the center of mass.

The radius of oscillation or equivalent length formula_7 of any physical pendulum can be shown to be
formula_9 

where formula_10 is the moment of inertia of the pendulum about the pivot point formula_11, formula_12 is the total mass of the pendulum, and formula_13 is the distance between the pivot point and the center of mass.
Substituting this expression in (1) above, the period formula_14 of a compound pendulum is given by
formula_15
for sufficiently small oscillations.

For example, a rigid uniform rod of length formula_16 pivoted about one end has moment of inertia formula_17. The center of mass is located at the center of the rod, so formula_18 Substituting these values into the above equation gives formula_19. This shows that a rigid rod pendulum has the same period as a simple pendulum of two-thirds its length.

Christiaan Huygens proved in 1673 that the pivot point and the center of oscillation are interchangeable. This means if any pendulum is turned upside down and swung from a pivot located at its previous center of oscillation, it will have the same period as before and the new center of oscillation will be at the old pivot point. In 1817 Henry Kater used this idea to produce a type of reversible pendulum, now known as a Kater pendulum, for improved measurements of the acceleration due to gravity.

=== Double pendulum ===

In physics and mathematics, in the area of dynamical systems, a double pendulum, also known as a chaotic pendulum, is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, forming a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions. The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic.

== History ==
One of the earliest known uses of a pendulum was a 1st-century seismometer device of Han dynasty Chinese scientist Zhang Heng. Its function was to sway and activate one of a series of levers after being disturbed by the tremor of an earthquake far away. Released by a lever, a small ball would fall out of the urn-shaped device into one of eight metal toads&#x27; mouths below, at the eight points of the compass, signifying the direction the earthquake was located.

Many sources claim that the 10th-century Egyptian astronomer Ibn Yunus used a pendulum for time measurement, but this was an error that originated in 1684 with the British historian Edward Bernard.

During the Renaissance, large hand-pumped pendulums were used as sources of power for manual reciprocating machines such as saws, bellows, and pumps.

=== 1602: Galileo&#x27;s research ===

Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first to study the properties of pendulums, beginning around 1602. The first recorded interest in pendulums made by Galileo was around 1588 in his posthumously published notes titled &quot;On Motion&quot;, in which he noted that heavier objects would continue to oscillate for a greater amount of time than lighter objects. The earliest extant report of his experimental research is contained in a letter to Guido Ubaldo dal Monte, from Padua, dated November 29, 1602. His biographer and student, Vincenzo Viviani, claimed his interest had been sparked around 1582 by the swinging motion of a chandelier in Pisa Cathedral. Galileo discovered the crucial property that makes pendulums useful as timekeepers, called isochronism; the period of the pendulum is approximately independent of the amplitude or width of the swing. He also found that the period is independent of the mass of the bob, and proportional to the square root of the length of the pendulum. He first employed freeswinging pendulums in simple timing applications. Santorio Santori in 1602 invented a device which measured a patient&#x27;s pulse by the length of a pendulum; the &quot;pulsilogium&quot;. In 1641 Galileo dictated to his son Vincenzo a design for a mechanism to keep a pendulum swinging, which has been described as the first pendulum clock; Vincenzo began construction, but had not completed it when he died in 1649.

=== 1656: The pendulum clock ===

In 1656 the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens built the first pendulum clock. This was a great improvement over existing mechanical clocks; their best accuracy was improved from around 15 minutes deviation a day to around 15 seconds a day. Pendulums spread over Europe as existing clocks were retrofitted with them.

The English scientist Robert Hooke studied the conical pendulum around 1666, consisting of a pendulum that is free to swing in two dimensions, with the bob rotating in a circle or ellipse. He used the motions of this device as a model to analyze the orbital motions of the planets. Hooke suggested to Isaac Newton in 1679 that the components of orbital motion consisted of inertial motion along a tangent direction plus an attractive motion in the radial direction. This played a part in Newton&#x27;s formulation of the law of universal gravitation. Robert Hooke was also responsible for suggesting as early as 1666 that the pendulum could be used to measure the force of gravity.

During his expedition to Cayenne, French Guiana in 1671, Jean Richer found that a pendulum clock was minutes per day slower at Cayenne than at Paris. From this he deduced that the force of gravity was lower at Cayenne. In 1687, Isaac Newton in &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; showed that this was because the Earth was not a true sphere but slightly oblate (flattened at the poles) from the effect of centrifugal force due to its rotation, causing gravity to increase with latitude. Portable pendulums began to be taken on voyages to distant lands, as precision gravimeters to measure the acceleration of gravity at different points on Earth, eventually resulting in accurate models of the shape of the Earth.

=== 1673: Huygens&#x27; &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot; ===
In 1673, 17 years after he invented the pendulum clock, Christiaan Huygens published his theory of the pendulum, &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum&quot;. Marin Mersenne and René Descartes had discovered around 1636 that the pendulum was not quite isochronous; its period increased somewhat with its amplitude. Huygens analyzed this problem by determining what curve an object must follow to descend by gravity to the same point in the same time interval, regardless of starting point; the so-called &quot;tautochrone curve&quot;. By a complicated method that was an early use of calculus, he showed this curve was a cycloid, rather than the circular arc of a pendulum, confirming that the pendulum was not isochronous and Galileo&#x27;s observation of isochronism was accurate only for small swings. Huygens also solved the problem of how to calculate the period of an arbitrarily shaped pendulum (called a &quot;compound pendulum&quot;), discovering the &quot;center of oscillation&quot;, and its interchangeability with the pivot point.

The existing clock movement, the verge escapement, made pendulums swing in very wide arcs of about 100°. Huygens showed this was a source of inaccuracy, causing the period to vary with amplitude changes caused by small unavoidable variations in the clock&#x27;s drive force. To make its period isochronous, Huygens mounted cycloidal-shaped metal guides next to the pivots in his clocks, that constrained the suspension cord and forced the pendulum to follow a cycloid arc (see cycloidal pendulum). This solution didn&#x27;t prove as practical as simply limiting the pendulum&#x27;s swing to small angles of a few degrees. The realization that only small swings were isochronous motivated the development of the anchor escapement around 1670, which reduced the pendulum swing in clocks to 4°–6°. This became the standard escapement used in pendulum clocks.

=== 1721: Temperature compensated pendulums ===
During the 18th and 19th century, the pendulum clock&#x27;s role as the most accurate timekeeper motivated much practical research into improving pendulums. It was found that a major source of error was that the pendulum rod expanded and contracted with changes in ambient temperature, changing the period of swing. This was solved with the invention of temperature compensated pendulums, the mercury pendulum in 1721 and the gridiron pendulum in 1726, reducing errors in precision pendulum clocks to a few seconds per week.

The accuracy of gravity measurements made with pendulums was limited by the difficulty of finding the location of their center of oscillation. Huygens had discovered in 1673 that a pendulum has the same period when hung from its center of oscillation as when hung from its pivot, and the distance between the two points was equal to the length of a simple gravity pendulum of the same period. In 1818 British Captain Henry Kater invented the reversible Kater&#x27;s pendulum which used this principle, making possible very accurate measurements of gravity. For the next century the reversible pendulum was the standard method of measuring absolute gravitational acceleration.

=== 1851: Foucault pendulum ===

In 1851, Jean Bernard Léon Foucault showed that the plane of oscillation of a pendulum, like a gyroscope, tends to stay constant regardless of the motion of the pivot, and that this could be used to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. He suspended a pendulum free to swing in two dimensions (later named the Foucault pendulum) from the dome of the Panthéon in Paris. The length of the cord was . Once the pendulum was set in motion, the plane of swing was observed to precess or rotate 360° clockwise in about 32 hours.
This was the first demonstration of the Earth&#x27;s rotation that did not depend on celestial observations, and a &quot;pendulum mania&quot; broke out, as Foucault pendulums were displayed in many cities and attracted large crowds.

=== 1930: Decline in use ===
Around 1900 low-thermal-expansion materials began to be used for pendulum rods in the highest precision clocks and other instruments, first invar, a nickel steel alloy, and later fused quartz, which made temperature compensation trivial. Precision pendulums were housed in low pressure tanks, which kept the air pressure constant to prevent changes in the period due to changes in buoyancy of the pendulum due to changing atmospheric pressure. The best pendulum clocks achieved accuracy of around a second per year.

The timekeeping accuracy of the pendulum was exceeded by the quartz crystal oscillator, invented in 1921, and quartz clocks, invented in 1927, replaced pendulum clocks as the world&#x27;s best timekeepers. Pendulum clocks were used as time standards until World War 2, although the French Time Service continued using them in their official time standard ensemble until 1954. Pendulum gravimeters were superseded by &quot;free fall&quot; gravimeters in the 1950s, but pendulum instruments continued to be used into the 1970s.

== Use for time measurement ==
For 300 years, from its discovery around 1582 until development of the quartz clock in the 1930s, the pendulum was the world&#x27;s standard for accurate timekeeping. In addition to clock pendulums, freeswinging seconds pendulums were widely used as precision timers in scientific experiments in the 17th and 18th centuries. Pendulums require great mechanical stability: a length change of only 0.02%, 0.2 mm in a grandfather clock pendulum, will cause an error of a minute per week.

=== Clock pendulums ===

Pendulums in clocks (see example at right) are usually made of a weight or bob &quot;(b)&quot; suspended by a rod of wood or metal &quot;(a)&quot;. To reduce air resistance (which accounts for most of the energy loss in precision clocks) the bob is traditionally a smooth disk with a lens-shaped cross section, although in antique clocks it often had carvings or decorations specific to the type of clock. In quality clocks the bob is made as heavy as the suspension can support and the movement can drive, since this improves the regulation of the clock (see Accuracy below). A common weight for seconds pendulum bobs is . Instead of hanging from a , clock pendulums are usually supported by a short straight spring &quot;(d)&quot; of flexible metal ribbon. This avoids the friction and &#x27;play&#x27; caused by a pivot, and the slight bending force of the spring merely adds to the pendulum&#x27;s restoring force. The highest precision clocks have pivots of &#x27;knife&#x27; blades resting on agate plates. The impulses to keep the pendulum swinging are provided by an arm hanging behind the pendulum called the &quot;crutch&quot;, &quot;(e)&quot;, which ends in a &quot;fork&quot;, &quot;(f)&quot; whose prongs embrace the pendulum rod. The crutch is pushed back and forth by the clock&#x27;s escapement, &quot;(g,h)&quot;.

Each time the pendulum swings through its centre position, it releases one tooth of the &quot;escape wheel&quot; &quot;(g)&quot;. The force of the clock&#x27;s mainspring or a driving weight hanging from a pulley, transmitted through the clock&#x27;s gear train, causes the wheel to turn, and a tooth presses against one of the pallets &quot;(h)&quot;, giving the pendulum a short push. The clock&#x27;s wheels, geared to the escape wheel, move forward a fixed amount with each pendulum swing, advancing the clock&#x27;s hands at a steady rate.

The pendulum always has a means of adjusting the period, usually by an adjustment nut &quot;(c)&quot; under the bob which moves it up or down on the rod. Moving the bob up decreases the pendulum&#x27;s length, causing the pendulum to swing faster and the clock to gain time. Some precision clocks have a small auxiliary adjustment weight on a threaded shaft on the bob, to allow finer adjustment. Some tower clocks and precision clocks use a tray attached near to the midpoint of the pendulum rod, to which small weights can be added or removed. This effectively shifts the centre of oscillation and allows the rate to be adjusted without stopping the clock.

The pendulum must be suspended from a rigid support. During operation, any elasticity will allow tiny imperceptible swaying motions of the support, which disturbs the clock&#x27;s period, resulting in error. Pendulum clocks should be attached firmly to a sturdy wall.

The most common pendulum length in quality clocks, which is always used in grandfather clocks, is the seconds pendulum, about long. In mantel clocks, half-second pendulums, long, or shorter, are used. Only a few large tower clocks use longer pendulums, the 1.5 second pendulum, long, or occasionally the two-second pendulum, which is used in Big Ben.

=== Temperature compensation ===

The largest source of error in early pendulums was slight changes in length due to thermal expansion and contraction of the pendulum rod with changes in ambient temperature. This was discovered when people noticed that pendulum clocks ran slower in summer, by as much as a minute per week (one of the first was Godefroy Wendelin, as reported by Huygens in 1658). Thermal expansion of pendulum rods was first studied by Jean Picard in 1669. A pendulum with a steel rod will expand by about 11.3 parts per million (ppm) with each degree Celsius increase, causing it to lose about 0.27 seconds per day for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, or 9 seconds per day for a change. Wood rods expand less, losing only about 6 seconds per day for a change, which is why quality clocks often had wooden pendulum rods. The wood had to be varnished to prevent water vapor from getting in, because changes in humidity also affected the length.

==== Mercury pendulum ====
The first device to compensate for this error was the mercury pendulum, invented by George Graham in 1721. The liquid metal mercury expands in volume with temperature. In a mercury pendulum, the pendulum&#x27;s weight (bob) is a container of mercury. With a temperature rise, the pendulum rod gets longer, but the mercury also expands and its surface level rises slightly in the container, moving its centre of mass closer to the pendulum pivot. By using the correct height of mercury in the container these two effects will cancel, leaving the pendulum&#x27;s centre of mass, and its period, unchanged with temperature. Its main disadvantage was that when the temperature changed, the rod would come to the new temperature quickly but the mass of mercury might take a day or two to reach the new temperature, causing the rate to deviate during that time. To improve thermal accommodation several thin containers were often used, made of metal. Mercury pendulums were the standard used in precision regulator clocks into the 20th century.

==== Gridiron pendulum ====
The most widely used compensated pendulum was the gridiron pendulum, invented in 1726 by John Harrison. This consists of alternating rods of two different metals, one with lower thermal expansion (CTE), steel, and one with higher thermal expansion, zinc or brass. The rods are connected by a frame, as shown in the drawing at the right, so that an increase in length of the zinc rods pushes the bob up, shortening the pendulum. With a temperature increase, the low expansion steel rods make the pendulum longer, while the high expansion zinc rods make it shorter. By making the rods of the correct lengths, the greater expansion of the zinc cancels out the expansion of the steel rods which have a greater combined length, and the pendulum stays the same length with temperature.

Zinc-steel gridiron pendulums are made with 5 rods, but the thermal expansion of brass is closer to steel, so brass-steel gridirons usually require 9 rods. Gridiron pendulums adjust to temperature changes faster than mercury pendulums, but scientists found that friction of the rods sliding in their holes in the frame caused gridiron pendulums to adjust in a series of tiny jumps. In high precision clocks this caused the clock&#x27;s rate to change suddenly with each jump. Later it was found that zinc is subject to creep. For these reasons mercury pendulums were used in the highest precision clocks, but gridirons were used in quality regulator clocks.

Gridiron pendulums became so associated with good quality that, to this day, many ordinary clock pendulums have decorative &#x27;fake&#x27; gridirons that don&#x27;t actually have any temperature compensation function.

==== Invar and fused quartz ====
Around 1900, low thermal expansion materials were developed which could be used as pendulum rods in order to make elaborate temperature compensation unnecessary. These were only used in a few of the highest precision clocks before the pendulum became obsolete as a time standard. In 1896 Charles Édouard Guillaume invented the nickel steel alloy Invar. This has a CTE of around (), resulting in pendulum temperature errors over of only 1.3 seconds per day, and this residual error could be compensated to zero with a few centimeters of aluminium under the pendulum bob (this can be seen in the Riefler clock image above). Invar pendulums were first used in 1898 in the Riefler regulator clock which achieved accuracy of 15 milliseconds per day. Suspension springs of Elinvar were used to eliminate temperature variation of the spring&#x27;s restoring force on the pendulum. Later fused quartz was used which had even lower CTE. These materials are the choice for modern high accuracy pendulums.

=== Atmospheric pressure ===
The effect of the surrounding air on a moving pendulum is complex and requires fluid mechanics to calculate precisely, but for most purposes its influence on the period can be accounted for by three effects:
* By Archimedes&#x27; principle the effective weight of the bob is reduced by the buoyancy of the air it displaces, while the mass (inertia) remains the same, reducing the pendulum&#x27;s acceleration during its swing and increasing the period. This depends on the air pressure and the density of the pendulum, but not its shape.
* The pendulum carries an amount of air with it as it swings, and the mass of this air increases the inertia of the pendulum, again reducing the acceleration and increasing the period. This depends on both its density and shape.
* Viscous air resistance slows the pendulum&#x27;s velocity. This has a negligible effect on the period, but dissipates energy, reducing the amplitude. This reduces the pendulum&#x27;s Q factor, requiring a stronger drive force from the clock&#x27;s mechanism to keep it moving, which causes increased disturbance to the period.
Increases in barometric pressure increase a pendulum&#x27;s period slightly due to the first two effects, by about . Researchers using pendulums to measure the acceleration of gravity had to correct the period for the air pressure at the altitude of measurement, computing the equivalent period of a pendulum swinging in vacuum. A pendulum clock was first operated in a constant-pressure tank by Friedrich Tiede in 1865 at the Berlin Observatory, and by 1900 the highest precision clocks were mounted in tanks that were kept at a constant pressure to eliminate changes in atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, in some a small aneroid barometer mechanism attached to the pendulum compensated for this effect.

=== Gravity ===
Pendulums are affected by changes in gravitational acceleration, which varies by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth, so precision pendulum clocks have to be recalibrated after a move. Even moving a pendulum clock to the top of a tall building can cause it to lose measurable time from the reduction in gravity.

== Accuracy of pendulums as timekeepers ==
The timekeeping elements in all clocks, which include pendulums, balance wheels, the quartz crystals used in quartz watches, and even the vibrating atoms in atomic clocks, are in physics called harmonic oscillators. The reason harmonic oscillators are used in clocks is that they vibrate or oscillate at a specific resonant frequency or period and resist oscillating at other rates. However, the resonant frequency is not infinitely &#x27;sharp&#x27;. Around the resonant frequency there is a narrow natural band of frequencies (or periods), called the resonance width or bandwidth, where the harmonic oscillator will oscillate. In a clock, the actual frequency of the pendulum may vary randomly within this resonance width in response to disturbances, but at frequencies outside this band, the clock will not function at all. The resonance width is determined by the damping, the frictional energy loss per swing of the pendulum.

=== &quot;Q&quot; factor ===
The measure of a harmonic oscillator&#x27;s resistance to disturbances to its oscillation period is a dimensionless parameter called the &quot;Q&quot; factor equal to the resonant frequency divided by the resonance width. The higher the &quot;Q&quot;, the smaller the resonance width, and the more constant the frequency or period of the oscillator for a given disturbance. The reciprocal of the Q is roughly proportional to the limiting accuracy achievable by a harmonic oscillator as a time standard.

The &quot;Q&quot; is related to how long it takes for the oscillations of an oscillator to die out. The &quot;Q&quot; of a pendulum can be measured by counting the number of oscillations it takes for the amplitude of the pendulum&#x27;s swing to decay to 1/&quot;e&quot; = 36.8% of its initial swing, and multiplying by &quot;π&quot;.

In a clock, the pendulum must receive pushes from the clock&#x27;s movement to keep it swinging, to replace the energy the pendulum loses to friction. These pushes, applied by a mechanism called the escapement, are the main source of disturbance to the pendulum&#x27;s motion. The &quot;Q&quot; is equal to 2&quot;π&quot; times the energy stored in the pendulum, divided by the energy lost to friction during each oscillation period, which is the same as the energy added by the escapement each period. It can be seen that the smaller the fraction of the pendulum&#x27;s energy that is lost to friction, the less energy needs to be added, the less the disturbance from the escapement, the more &#x27;independent&#x27; the pendulum is of the clock&#x27;s mechanism, and the more constant its period is. The &quot;Q&quot; of a pendulum is given by:
formula_20
where &quot;M&quot; is the mass of the bob, is the pendulum&#x27;s radian frequency of oscillation, and Γ is the frictional damping force on the pendulum per unit velocity.

&quot;ω&quot; is fixed by the pendulum&#x27;s period, and &quot;M&quot; is limited by the load capacity and rigidity of the suspension. So the &quot;Q&quot; of clock pendulums is increased by minimizing frictional losses (Γ). Precision pendulums are suspended on low friction pivots consisting of triangular shaped &#x27;knife&#x27; edges resting on agate plates. Around 99% of the energy loss in a freeswinging pendulum is due to air friction, so mounting a pendulum in a vacuum tank can increase the &quot;Q&quot;, and thus the accuracy, by a factor of 100.

The &quot;Q&quot; of pendulums ranges from several thousand in an ordinary clock to several hundred thousand for precision regulator pendulums swinging in vacuum. A quality home pendulum clock might have a &quot;Q&quot; of 10,000 and an accuracy of 10 seconds per month. The most accurate commercially produced pendulum clock was the Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock, invented in 1921. Its Invar master pendulum swinging in a vacuum tank had a &quot;Q&quot; of 110,000 and an error rate of around a second per year.

Their Q of 103–105 is one reason why pendulums are more accurate timekeepers than the balance wheels in watches, with &quot;Q&quot; around 100–300, but less accurate than the quartz crystals in quartz clocks, with &quot;Q&quot; of 105–106.

=== Escapement ===
Pendulums (unlike, for example, quartz crystals) have a low enough &quot;Q&quot; that the disturbance caused by the impulses to keep them moving is generally the limiting factor on their timekeeping accuracy. Therefore, the design of the escapement, the mechanism that provides these impulses, has a large effect on the accuracy of a clock pendulum. If the impulses given to the pendulum by the escapement each swing could be exactly identical, the response of the pendulum would be identical, and its period would be constant. However, this is not achievable; unavoidable random fluctuations in the force due to friction of the clock&#x27;s pallets, lubrication variations, and changes in the torque provided by the clock&#x27;s power source as it runs down, mean that the force of the impulse applied by the escapement varies.

If these variations in the escapement&#x27;s force cause changes in the pendulum&#x27;s width of swing (amplitude), this will cause corresponding slight changes in the period, since (as discussed at top) a pendulum with a finite swing is not quite isochronous. Therefore, the goal of traditional escapement design is to apply the force with the proper profile, and at the correct point in the pendulum&#x27;s cycle, so force variations have no effect on the pendulum&#x27;s amplitude. This is called an &quot;isochronous escapement&quot;.

=== The Airy condition ===
Clockmakers had known for centuries that the disturbing effect of the escapement&#x27;s drive force on the period of a pendulum is smallest if given as a short impulse as the pendulum passes through its bottom equilibrium position. If the impulse occurs before the pendulum reaches bottom, during the downward swing, it will have the effect of shortening the pendulum&#x27;s natural period, so an increase in drive force will decrease the period. If the impulse occurs after the pendulum reaches bottom, during the upswing, it will lengthen the period, so an increase in drive force will increase the pendulum&#x27;s period. In 1826 British astronomer George Airy proved this; specifically, he proved that if a pendulum is driven by an impulse that is symmetrical about its bottom equilibrium position, the pendulum&#x27;s period will be unaffected by changes in the drive force. The most accurate escapements, such as the deadbeat, approximately satisfy this condition.

== Gravity measurement ==
The presence of the acceleration of gravity &quot;g&quot; in the periodicity equation (1) for a pendulum means that the local gravitational acceleration of the Earth can be calculated from the period of a pendulum. A pendulum can therefore be used as a gravimeter to measure the local gravity, which varies by over 0.5% across the surface of the Earth. The pendulum in a clock is disturbed by the pushes it receives from the clock movement, so freeswinging pendulums were used, and were the standard instruments of gravimetry up to the 1930s.

The difference between clock pendulums and gravimeter pendulums is that to measure gravity, the pendulum&#x27;s length as well as its period has to be measured. The period of freeswinging pendulums could be found to great precision by comparing their swing with a precision clock that had been adjusted to keep correct time by the passage of stars overhead. In the early measurements, a weight on a cord was suspended in front of the clock pendulum, and its length adjusted until the two pendulums swung in exact synchronism. Then the length of the cord was measured. From the length and the period, &quot;g&quot; could be calculated from equation (1).

=== The seconds pendulum ===
The seconds pendulum, a pendulum with a period of two seconds so each swing takes one second, was widely used to measure gravity, because its period could be easily measured by comparing it to precision regulator clocks, which all had seconds pendulums. By the late 17th century, the length of the seconds pendulum became the standard measure of the strength of gravitational acceleration at a location. By 1700 its length had been measured with submillimeter accuracy at several cities in Europe. For a seconds pendulum, &quot;g&quot; is proportional to its length:

=== Early observations ===
* 1620: British scientist Francis Bacon was one of the first to propose using a pendulum to measure gravity, suggesting taking one up a mountain to see if gravity varies with altitude.
* 1644: Even before the pendulum clock, French priest Marin Mersenne first determined the length of the seconds pendulum was , by comparing the swing of a pendulum to the time it took a weight to fall a measured distance. He also was first to discover the dependence of the period on amplitude of swing. 
* 1669: Jean Picard determined the length of the seconds pendulum at Paris, using a copper ball suspended by an aloe fiber, obtaining . He also did the first experiments on thermal expansion and contraction of pendulum rods with temperature.
* 1672: The first observation that gravity varied at different points on Earth was made in 1672 by Jean Richer, who took a pendulum clock to Cayenne, French Guiana and found that it lost minutes per day; its seconds pendulum had to be shortened by &quot;lignes&quot; (2.6 mm) shorter than at Paris, to keep correct time. In 1687 Isaac Newton in &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; showed this was because the Earth had a slightly oblate shape (flattened at the poles) caused by the centrifugal force of its rotation. At higher latitudes the surface was closer to the center of the Earth, so gravity increased with latitude. From this time on, pendulums began to be taken to distant lands to measure gravity, and tables were compiled of the length of the seconds pendulum at different locations on Earth. In 1743 Alexis Claude Clairaut created the first hydrostatic model of the Earth, Clairaut&#x27;s theorem, which allowed the ellipticity of the Earth to be calculated from gravity measurements. Progressively more accurate models of the shape of the Earth followed.
* 1687: Newton experimented with pendulums (described in &quot;Principia&quot;) and found that equal length pendulums with bobs made of different materials had the same period, proving that the gravitational force on different substances was exactly proportional to their mass (inertia). This principle, called the equivalence principle, confirmed to greater accuracy in later experiments, became the foundation on which Albert Einstein based his general theory of relativity. 

* 1737: French mathematician Pierre Bouguer made a sophisticated series of pendulum observations in the Andes mountains, Peru. He used a copper pendulum bob in the shape of a double pointed cone suspended by a thread; the bob could be reversed to eliminate the effects of nonuniform density. He calculated the length to the center of oscillation of thread and bob combined, instead of using the center of the bob. He corrected for thermal expansion of the measuring rod and barometric pressure, giving his results for a pendulum swinging in vacuum. Bouguer swung the same pendulum at three different elevations, from sea level to the top of the high Peruvian &quot;altiplano&quot;. Gravity should fall with the inverse square of the distance from the center of the Earth. Bouguer found that it fell off slower, and correctly attributed the &#x27;extra&#x27; gravity to the gravitational field of the huge Peruvian plateau. From the density of rock samples he calculated an estimate of the effect of the &quot;altiplano&quot; on the pendulum, and comparing this with the gravity of the Earth was able to make the first rough estimate of the density of the Earth.
* 1747: Daniel Bernoulli showed how to correct for the lengthening of the period due to a finite angle of swing &quot;θ&quot;0 by using the first order correction &quot;θ&quot;02/16, giving the period of a pendulum with an extremely small swing.
* 1792: To define a pendulum standard of length for use with the new metric system, in 1792 Jean-Charles de Borda and Jean-Dominique Cassini made a precise measurement of the seconds pendulum at Paris. They used a -inch (14 mm) platinum ball suspended by a iron wire. Their main innovation was a technique called the &quot;method of coincidences&quot; which allowed the period of pendulums to be compared with great precision. (Bouguer had also used this method). The time interval Δ&quot;t&quot; between the recurring instants when the two pendulums swung in synchronism was timed. From this the difference between the periods of the pendulums, &quot;T&quot;1 and &quot;T&quot;2, could be calculated: formula_22
* 1821: Francesco Carlini made pendulum observations on top of Mount Cenis, Italy, from which, using methods similar to Bouguer&#x27;s, he calculated the density of the Earth. He compared his measurements to an estimate of the gravity at his location assuming the mountain wasn&#x27;t there, calculated from previous nearby pendulum measurements at sea level. His measurements showed &#x27;excess&#x27; gravity, which he allocated to the effect of the mountain. Modeling the mountain as a segment of a sphere in diameter and high, from rock samples he calculated its gravitational field, and estimated the density of the Earth at 4.39 times that of water. Later recalculations by others gave values of 4.77 and 4.95, illustrating the uncertainties in these geographical methods.

=== Kater&#x27;s pendulum ===


The precision of the early gravity measurements above was limited by the difficulty of measuring the length of the pendulum, &quot;L&quot; . &quot;L&quot; was the length of an idealized simple gravity pendulum (described at top), which has all its mass concentrated in a point at the end of the cord. In 1673 Huygens had shown that the period of a rigid bar pendulum (called a &quot;compound pendulum&quot;) was equal to the period of a simple pendulum with a length equal to the distance between the point and a point called the center of oscillation, located under the center of gravity, that depends on the mass distribution along the pendulum. But there was no accurate way of determining the center of oscillation in a real pendulum. Huygens&#x27; discovery is sometimes referred to as &quot;Huygens&#x27; law of the (cycloidal) pendulum&quot;.

To get around this problem, the early researchers above approximated an ideal simple pendulum as closely as possible by using a metal sphere suspended by a light wire or cord. If the wire was light enough, the center of oscillation was close to the center of gravity of the ball, at its geometric center. This &quot;ball and wire&quot; type of pendulum wasn&#x27;t very accurate, because it didn&#x27;t swing as a rigid body, and the elasticity of the wire caused its length to change slightly as the pendulum swung.

However Huygens had also proved that in any pendulum, the pivot point and the center of oscillation were interchangeable. That is, if a pendulum were turned upside down and hung from its center of oscillation, it would have the same period as it did in the previous position, and the old pivot point would be the new center of oscillation.

British physicist and army captain Henry Kater in 1817 realized that Huygens&#x27; principle could be used to find the length of a simple pendulum with the same period as a real pendulum. If a pendulum was built with a second adjustable pivot point near the bottom so it could be hung upside down, and the second pivot was adjusted until the periods when hung from both pivots were the same, the second pivot would be at the center of oscillation, and the distance between the two pivots would be the length &quot;L&quot; of a simple pendulum with the same period.

Kater built a reversible pendulum (&quot;see drawing&quot;) consisting of a brass bar with two opposing pivots made of short triangular &quot;knife&quot; blades &quot;(a)&quot; near either end. It could be swung from either pivot, with the knife blades supported on agate plates. Rather than make one pivot adjustable, he attached the pivots a meter apart and instead adjusted the periods with a moveable weight on the pendulum rod &quot;(b,c)&quot;. In operation, the pendulum is hung in front of a precision clock, and the period timed, then turned upside down and the period timed again. The weight is adjusted with the adjustment screw until the periods are equal. Then putting this period and the distance between the pivots into equation (1) gives the gravitational acceleration &quot;g&quot; very accurately.

Kater timed the swing of his pendulum using the &quot;method of coincidences&quot; and measured the distance between the two pivots with a micrometer. After applying corrections for the finite amplitude of swing, the buoyancy of the bob, the barometric pressure and altitude, and temperature, he obtained a value of 39.13929 inches for the seconds pendulum at London, in vacuum, at sea level, at 62 °F. The largest variation from the mean of his 12 observations was 0.00028 in. representing a precision of gravity measurement of 7×10−6 (7 mGal or 70 μm/s2). Kater&#x27;s measurement was used as Britain&#x27;s official standard of length (see below) from 1824 to 1855.

Reversible pendulums (known technically as &quot;convertible&quot; pendulums) employing Kater&#x27;s principle were used for absolute gravity measurements into the 1930s.

=== Later pendulum gravimeters ===
The increased accuracy made possible by Kater&#x27;s pendulum helped make gravimetry a standard part of geodesy. Since the exact location (latitude and longitude) of the &#x27;station&#x27; where the gravity measurement was made was necessary, gravity measurements became part of surveying, and pendulums were taken on the great geodetic surveys of the 18th century, particularly the Great Trigonometric Survey of India.
* Invariable pendulums: Kater introduced the idea of &quot;relative&quot; gravity measurements, to supplement the &quot;absolute&quot; measurements made by a Kater&#x27;s pendulum. Comparing the gravity at two different points was an easier process than measuring it absolutely by the Kater method. All that was necessary was to time the period of an ordinary (single pivot) pendulum at the first point, then transport the pendulum to the other point and time its period there. Since the pendulum&#x27;s length was constant, from (1) the ratio of the gravitational accelerations was equal to the inverse of the ratio of the periods squared, and no precision length measurements were necessary. So once the gravity had been measured absolutely at some central station, by the Kater or other accurate method, the gravity at other points could be found by swinging pendulums at the central station and then taking them to the other location and timing their swing there. Kater made up a set of &quot;invariable&quot; pendulums, with only one knife edge pivot, which were taken to many countries after first being swung at a central station at Kew Observatory, UK.
* Airy&#x27;s coal pit experiments: Starting in 1826, using methods similar to Bouguer, British astronomer George Airy attempted to determine the density of the Earth by pendulum gravity measurements at the top and bottom of a coal mine. The gravitational force below the surface of the Earth decreases rather than increasing with depth, because by Gauss&#x27;s law the mass of the spherical shell of crust above the subsurface point does not contribute to the gravity. The 1826 experiment was aborted by the flooding of the mine, but in 1854 he conducted an improved experiment at the Harton coal mine, using seconds pendulums swinging on agate plates, timed by precision chronometers synchronized by an electrical circuit. He found the lower pendulum was slower by 2.24 seconds per day. This meant that the gravitational acceleration at the bottom of the mine, 1250 ft below the surface, was 1/14,000 less than it should have been from the inverse square law; that is the attraction of the spherical shell was 1/14,000 of the attraction of the Earth. From samples of surface rock he estimated the mass of the spherical shell of crust, and from this estimated that the density of the Earth was 6.565 times that of water. Von Sterneck attempted to repeat the experiment in 1882 but found inconsistent results.
* Repsold-Bessel pendulum: It was time-consuming and error-prone to repeatedly swing the Kater&#x27;s pendulum and adjust the weights until the periods were equal. Friedrich Bessel showed in 1835 that this was unnecessary. As long as the periods were close together, the gravity could be calculated from the two periods and the center of gravity of the pendulum. So the reversible pendulum didn&#x27;t need to be adjustable, it could just be a bar with two pivots. Bessel also showed that if the pendulum was made symmetrical in form about its center, but was weighted internally at one end, the errors due to air drag would cancel out. Further, another error due to the finite diameter of the knife edges could be made to cancel out if they were interchanged between measurements. Bessel didn&#x27;t construct such a pendulum, but in 1864 Adolf Repsold, under contract by the Swiss Geodetic Commission made a pendulum along these lines. The Repsold pendulum was about 56 cm long and had a period of about second. It was used extensively by European geodetic agencies, and with the Kater pendulum in the Survey of India. Similar pendulums of this type were designed by Charles Pierce and C. Defforges.
* Von Sterneck and Mendenhall gravimeters: In 1887 Austro-Hungarian scientist Robert von Sterneck developed a small gravimeter pendulum mounted in a temperature-controlled vacuum tank to eliminate the effects of temperature and air pressure. It used a &quot;half-second pendulum,&quot; having a period close to one second, about 25 cm long. The pendulum was nonreversible, so the instrument was used for relative gravity measurements, but their small size made them small and portable. The period of the pendulum was picked off by reflecting the image of an electric spark created by a precision chronometer off a mirror mounted at the top of the pendulum rod. The Von Sterneck instrument, and a similar instrument developed by Thomas C. Mendenhall of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1890, were used extensively for surveys into the 1920s.

:The Mendenhall pendulum was actually a more accurate timekeeper than the highest precision clocks of the time, and as the &#x27;world&#x27;s best clock&#x27; it was used by Albert A. Michelson in his 1924 measurements of the speed of light on Mt. Wilson, California.
* Double pendulum gravimeters: Starting in 1875, the increasing accuracy of pendulum measurements revealed another source of error in existing instruments: the swing of the pendulum caused a slight swaying of the tripod stand used to support portable pendulums, introducing error. In 1875 Charles S Peirce calculated that measurements of the length of the seconds pendulum made with the Repsold instrument required a correction of 0.2 mm due to this error. In 1880 C. Defforges used a Michelson interferometer to measure the sway of the stand dynamically, and interferometers were added to the standard Mendenhall apparatus to calculate sway corrections. A method of preventing this error was first suggested in 1877 by Hervé Faye and advocated by Peirce, Cellérier and Furtwangler: mount two identical pendulums on the same support, swinging with the same amplitude, 180° out of phase. The opposite motion of the pendulums would cancel out any sideways forces on the support. The idea was opposed due to its complexity, but by the start of the 20th century the Von Sterneck device and other instruments were modified to swing multiple pendulums simultaneously.
* Gulf gravimeter: One of the last and most accurate pendulum gravimeters was the apparatus developed in 1929 by the Gulf Research and Development Co. It used two pendulums made of fused quartz, each in length with a period of 0.89 second, swinging on pyrex knife edge pivots, 180° out of phase. They were mounted in a permanently sealed temperature and humidity controlled vacuum chamber. Stray electrostatic charges on the quartz pendulums had to be discharged by exposing them to a radioactive salt before use. The period was detected by reflecting a light beam from a mirror at the top of the pendulum, recorded by a chart recorder and compared to a precision crystal oscillator calibrated against the WWV radio time signal. This instrument was accurate to within (0.3–0.5)×10−7 (30–50 microgals or 3–5 nm/s2). It was used into the 1960s.

Relative pendulum gravimeters were superseded by the simpler LaCoste zero-length spring gravimeter, invented in 1934 by Lucien LaCoste. Absolute (reversible) pendulum gravimeters were replaced in the 1950s by free fall gravimeters, in which a weight is allowed to fall in a vacuum tank and its acceleration is measured by an optical interferometer.

== Standard of length ==
Because the acceleration of gravity is constant at a given point on Earth, the period of a simple pendulum at a given location depends only on its length. Additionally, gravity varies only slightly at different locations. Almost from the pendulum&#x27;s discovery until the early 19th century, this property led scientists to suggest using a pendulum of a given period as a standard of length.

Until the 19th century, countries based their systems of length measurement on prototypes, metal bar primary standards, such as the standard yard in Britain kept at the Houses of Parliament, and the standard &quot;toise&quot; in France, kept at Paris. These were vulnerable to damage or destruction over the years, and because of the difficulty of comparing prototypes, the same unit often had different lengths in distant towns, creating opportunities for fraud. During the Enlightenment scientists argued for a length standard that was based on some property of nature that could be determined by measurement, creating an indestructible, universal standard. The period of pendulums could be measured very precisely by timing them with clocks that were set by the stars. A pendulum standard amounted to defining the unit of length by the gravitational force of the Earth, for all intents constant, and the second, which was defined by the rotation rate of the Earth, also constant. The idea was that anyone, anywhere on Earth, could recreate the standard by constructing a pendulum that swung with the defined period and measuring its length.

Virtually all proposals were based on the seconds pendulum, in which each swing (a half period) takes one second, which is about a meter (39 inches) long, because by the late 17th century it had become a standard for measuring gravity (see previous section). By the 18th century its length had been measured with sub-millimeter accuracy at a number of cities in Europe and around the world.

The initial attraction of the pendulum length standard was that it was believed (by early scientists such as Huygens and Wren) that gravity was constant over the Earth&#x27;s surface, so a given pendulum had the same period at any point on Earth. So the length of the standard pendulum could be measured at any location, and would not be tied to any given nation or region; it would be a truly democratic, worldwide standard. Although Richer found in 1672 that gravity varies at different points on the globe, the idea of a pendulum length standard remained popular, because it was found that gravity only varies with latitude. Gravitational acceleration increases smoothly from the equator to the poles, due to the oblate shape of the Earth, so at any given latitude (east–west line), gravity was constant enough that the length of a seconds pendulum was the same within the measurement capability of the 18th century. Thus the unit of length could be defined at a given latitude and measured at any point along that latitude. For example, a pendulum standard defined at 45° north latitude, a popular choice, could be measured in parts of France, Italy, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, the United States and Canada. In addition, it could be recreated at any location at which the gravitational acceleration had been accurately measured.

By the mid 19th century, increasingly accurate pendulum measurements by Edward Sabine and Thomas Young revealed that gravity, and thus the length of any pendulum standard, varied measurably with local geologic features such as mountains and dense subsurface rocks. So a pendulum length standard had to be defined at a single point on Earth and could only be measured there. This took much of the appeal from the concept, and efforts to adopt pendulum standards were abandoned.

=== Early proposals ===
One of the first to suggest defining length with a pendulum was Flemish scientist Isaac Beeckman who in 1631 recommended making the seconds pendulum &quot;the invariable measure for all people at all times in all places&quot;. Marin Mersenne, who first measured the seconds pendulum in 1644, also suggested it. The first official proposal for a pendulum standard was made by the British Royal Society in 1660, advocated by Christiaan Huygens and Ole Rømer, basing it on Mersenne&#x27;s work, and Huygens in &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot; proposed a &quot;horary foot&quot; defined as 1/3 of the seconds pendulum. Christopher Wren was another early supporter. The idea of a pendulum standard of length must have been familiar to people as early as 1663, because Samuel Butler satirizes it in &quot;Hudibras&quot;:
:Upon the bench I will so handle ‘em
:That the vibration of this pendulum
:Shall make all taylors’ yards of one
:Unanimous opinion
In 1671 Jean Picard proposed a pendulum-defined &#x27;universal foot&#x27; in his influential &quot;Mesure de la Terre&quot;. Gabriel Mouton around 1670 suggested defining the &quot;toise&quot; either by a seconds pendulum or a minute of terrestrial degree. A plan for a complete system of units based on the pendulum was advanced in 1675 by Italian polymath Tito Livio Burratini. In France in 1747, geographer Charles Marie de la Condamine proposed defining length by a seconds pendulum at the equator; since at this location a pendulum&#x27;s swing wouldn&#x27;t be distorted by the Earth&#x27;s rotation. James Steuart (1780) and George Skene Keith were also supporters.

By the end of the 18th century, when many nations were reforming their weight and measure systems, the seconds pendulum was the leading choice for a new definition of length, advocated by prominent scientists in several major nations. In 1790, then US Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson proposed to Congress a comprehensive decimalized US &#x27;metric system&#x27; based on the seconds pendulum at 38° North latitude, the mean latitude of the United States. No action was taken on this proposal. In Britain the leading advocate of the pendulum was politician John Riggs Miller. When his efforts to promote a joint British–French–American metric system fell through in 1790, he proposed a British system based on the length of the seconds pendulum at London. This standard was adopted in 1824 (below).

=== The metre ===
In the discussions leading up to the French adoption of the metric system in 1791, the leading candidate for the definition of the new unit of length, the metre, was the seconds pendulum at 45° North latitude. It was advocated by a group led by French politician Talleyrand and mathematician Antoine Nicolas Caritat de Condorcet. This was one of the three final options considered by the French Academy of Sciences committee. However, on March 19, 1791, the committee instead chose to base the metre on the length of the meridian through Paris. A pendulum definition was rejected because of its variability at different locations, and because it defined length by a unit of time. (However, since 1983 the metre has been officially defined in terms of the length of the second and the speed of light.) A possible additional reason is that the radical French Academy didn&#x27;t want to base their new system on the second, a traditional and nondecimal unit from the &quot;ancien regime&quot;.

Although not defined by the pendulum, the final length chosen for the metre, 10−7 of the pole-to-equator meridian arc, was very close to the length of the seconds pendulum (0.9937 m), within 0.63%. Although no reason for this particular choice was given at the time, it was probably to facilitate the use of the seconds pendulum as a secondary standard, as was proposed in the official document. So the modern world&#x27;s standard unit of length is certainly closely linked historically with the seconds pendulum.

=== Britain and Denmark ===
Britain and Denmark appear to be the only nations that (for a short time) based their units of length on the pendulum. In 1821 the Danish inch was defined as 1/38 of the length of the mean solar seconds pendulum at 45° latitude at the meridian of Skagen, at sea level, in vacuum. The British parliament passed the &quot;Imperial Weights and Measures Act&quot; in 1824, a reform of the British standard system which declared that if the prototype standard yard was destroyed, it would be recovered by defining the inch so that the length of the solar seconds pendulum at London, at sea level, in a vacuum, at 62 °F was 39.1393 inches. This also became the US standard, since at the time the US used British measures. However, when the prototype yard was lost in the 1834 Houses of Parliament fire, it proved impossible to recreate it accurately from the pendulum definition, and in 1855 Britain repealed the pendulum standard and returned to prototype standards.

== Other uses ==

=== Seismometers ===
A pendulum in which the rod is not vertical but almost horizontal was used in early seismometers for measuring Earth tremors. The bob of the pendulum does not move when its mounting does, and the difference in the movements is recorded on a drum chart.

=== Schuler tuning ===

As first explained by Maximilian Schuler in a 1923 paper, a pendulum whose period exactly equals the orbital period of a hypothetical satellite orbiting just above the surface of the Earth (about 84 minutes) will tend to remain pointing at the center of the Earth when its support is suddenly displaced. This principle, called Schuler tuning, is used in inertial guidance systems in ships and aircraft that operate on the surface of the Earth. No physical pendulum is used, but the control system that keeps the inertial platform containing the gyroscopes stable is modified so the device acts as though it is attached to such a pendulum, keeping the platform always facing down as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth.

=== Coupled pendulums ===

In 1665 Huygens made a curious observation about pendulum clocks. Two clocks had been placed on his mantlepiece, and he noted that they had acquired an opposing motion. That is, their pendulums were beating in unison but in the opposite direction; 180° out of phase. Regardless of how the two clocks were started, he found that they would eventually return to this state, thus making the first recorded observation of a coupled oscillator.

The cause of this behavior was that the two pendulums were affecting each other through slight motions of the supporting mantlepiece. This process is called entrainment or mode locking in physics and is observed in other coupled oscillators. Synchronized pendulums have been used in clocks and were widely used in gravimeters in the early 20th century. Although Huygens only observed out-of-phase synchronization, recent investigations have shown the existence of in-phase synchronization, as well as &quot;death&quot; states wherein one or both clocks stops.

=== Religious practice ===

Pendulum motion appears in religious ceremonies as well. The swinging incense burner called a censer, also known as a thurible, is an example of a pendulum. Pendulums are also seen at many gatherings in eastern Mexico where they mark the turning of the tides on the day which the tides are at their highest point. Pendulums may also be used for dowsing.

=== Education ===

Pendulums are widely used in science education as an example of a harmonic oscillator, to teach dynamics and oscillatory motion. One use is to demonstrate the law of conservation of energy. A heavy object such as a bowling ball or wrecking ball is attached to a string. The weight is then moved to within a few inches of a volunteer&#x27;s face, then released and allowed to swing and come back. In most instances, the weight reverses direction and then returns to (almost) the same position as the original release location — &quot;i.e.&quot; a small distance from the volunteer&#x27;s face — thus leaving the volunteer unharmed. On occasion the volunteer is injured if either the volunteer does not stand still or the pendulum is initially released with a push (so that when it returns it surpasses the release position).

=== Torture device ===

It is claimed that the pendulum was used as an instrument of torture and execution by the Spanish Inquisition in the 18th century. The allegation is contained in the 1826 book &quot;The history of the Inquisition of Spain &quot; by the Spanish priest, historian and liberal activist Juan Antonio Llorente. A swinging pendulum whose edge is a knife blade slowly descends toward a bound prisoner until it cuts into his body. This method of torture came to popular consciousness through the 1842 short story &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; by American author Edgar Allan Poe.

Most knowledgeable sources are skeptical that this torture was ever actually used. The only evidence of its use is one paragraph in the preface to Llorente&#x27;s 1826 &quot;History&quot;, relating a second-hand account by a single prisoner released from the Inquisition&#x27;s Madrid dungeon in 1820, who purportedly described the pendulum torture method. Modern sources point out that due to Jesus&#x27; admonition against bloodshed, Inquisitors were only allowed to use torture methods which did not spill blood, and the pendulum method would have violated this stricture. One theory is that Llorente misunderstood the account he heard; the prisoner was actually referring to another common Inquisition torture, the &quot;strappado&quot; (garrucha), in which the prisoner has his hands tied behind his back and is hoisted off the floor by a rope tied to his hands. This method was also known as the &quot;pendulum&quot;. Poe&#x27;s popular horror tale, and public awareness of the Inquisition&#x27;s other brutal methods, has kept the myth of this elaborate torture method alive.

=== Pendulum wave ===

A pendulum wave is a physics demonstration and kinetic art comprising several uncoupled pendulums with different lengths. As the pendulums oscillate, they appear to produce travelling and standing waves, beating, and random motion.

== Notes ==

The value of g reflected by the period of a pendulum varies from place to place. The gravitational force varies with distance from the center of the Earth, i.e. with altitude or because the Earth&#x27;s shape is oblate, g varies with latitude.
A more important cause of this reduction in g at the equator is because the equator is spinning at one revolution per day, so the acceleration by the gravitational force is partially canceled there by the centrifugal force.

<text>Special Olympics is the world&#x27;s largest sports organization for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, providing year-round training and activities to 5 million participants and Unified Sports partners in 172 countries. Special Olympics competitions are held daily, all around the world—including local, national and regional competitions, adding up to more than 100,000 events a year. Like the International Paralympic Committee, the Special Olympics organization is recognized by the International Olympic Committee; however, unlike the Paralympic Games, its World Games are not held in the same year nor in conjunction with the Olympic Games.

The Special Olympics World Games is a major event put on by the Special Olympics committee. The World Games generally alternate between summer and winter games, in two-year cycles, recurring every fourth year. The games were first held on July 20, 1968, in Chicago, Illinois, United States, with about 1,000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada. At those first games, honorary event chair Eunice Kennedy Shriver announced the formation of the Special Olympics organization. International participation expanded in subsequent games. In 2003, the first summer games held outside the United States were in Dublin, Ireland, with 7000 athletes from 150 countries. The most recent Summer Games were hosted in Berlin, Germany, between June 16 to 25, 2023.

The first World Winter Games were held in 1977 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, US. Austria hosted the first Winter Games outside the United States in 1993. The most recent Special Olympics World Winter Games were held in Graz, Schladming and Ramsau, Austria, from March 14, 2017, to March 25, 2017 (see also 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games). During the World Winter Games of 2013 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the first Special Olympics Global Development Summit was held on &quot;Ending the Cycle of Poverty and Exclusion for People with Intellectual Disabilities&quot;, gathering government officials, activists and business leaders from around the world.

==History==
Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of US President John F. Kennedy, believed that mentally handicapped people could be happy and live meaningful lives. Eunice founded the Special Olympics to positively change attitudes towards mentally handicapped people. In June 1963, Kennedy Shriver started a day camp called Camp Shriver for children with intellectual and physical disabilities at her home in Potomac, Maryland. The camp sought to address the concern that disabled children had very little opportunity to participate in organised athletic events. With Camp Shriver as an example, Kennedy Shriver, then head of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation and a member of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Panel on Mental Retardation, promoted the concept of involvement in physical activity and other opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. Camp Shriver became an annual event, and the Kennedy Foundation gave grants to universities, recreation departments, and community centers to hold similar camps.

Also in the early 1960s, Kennedy Shriver wrote an article in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, stating that her sister, also President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s sister, was born with intellectual disabilities. Her sister, Rosemary Kennedy was slow to learn, suffered seizures and mood swings. Her mother was told by doctors that Rosemary&#x27;s situation was hopeless. In the early 1940s, Rosemary was prescribed a lobotomy, which left her incapacitated. This frank article about the President&#x27;s family was seen as a &quot;watershed&quot; in changing public attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities. Rosemary&#x27;s disability provided Kennedy Shriver with an overall vision that people with intellectual disabilities could compete and at the same time unify together in public. It has often been said that Rosemary&#x27;s disability was Eunice&#x27;s inspiration to form Special Olympics (as the movement came to be called); Eunice told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1995 that that was not exactly the case. &quot;The games should not focus on one individual,&quot; she said.

In 1958, Dr. James N. Oliver of England had conducted pioneering research, including a ground-breaking study showing that physical exercise and activities for children with intellectual disabilities had positive effects that also carried over into the classroom (&quot;The Effects of Physical Conditioning Exercises and Activities on the Mental Characteristics of Educationally Sub-Normal Boys, British Journal of Educational Psychology, XXVIII, June 1958). Oliver in 1964 served as a consultant to Camp Shriver. 

The 1964 research of Dr. Frank Hayden, a Canadian physical education professor from London, Ontario, demonstrated that intellectually disabled people can and should participate in physical exercise. He believed that the benefits of such activity would be seen in all areas of the athletes&#x27; lives. With the help of a local school that offered space in its gym, Hayden started one of the first public organised sports programs, floor hockey for individuals with intellectual disabilities, in the fall of 1968. In the mid-1960s, Hayden also developed an idea for national games, and his work brought him to the attention of the Kennedy Foundation. He shared his ideas for national games, while taking a teaching sabbatical and working for the foundation.

The first Special Olympics games were held on July 20, 1968, at Soldier Field in Chicago. About 1,000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada took part in the one-day event, which was a joint venture by the Kennedy Foundation and the Chicago Park District. Anne McGlone Burke, then a physical education teacher with the Chicago Park District, began with the idea for a one-time, city-wide, Olympic-style athletic competition for people with special needs. Burke approached the Kennedy Foundation in 1967 to help fund the event. Kennedy Shriver, in turn, encouraged her to expand the idea beyond the city and the foundation provided a grant of $25,000. When Burke had approached another charity for funding, she was told, &quot;You should be ashamed of yourself putting these kinds of kids on display&quot;. The advisory committee to the Chicago Special Olympics included Dr. William Freeberg from Southern Illinois University, Dr. Hayden of the Kennedy Foundation, Dr. Arthur Peavy, Burke, William McFetridge, and Stephen Kelly of the Chicago Park District, as well as, Olympic decathlon champion Rafer Johnson. Kennedy Shriver was honorary chair. At the July 1968 games, Kennedy Shriver announced the formation of Special Olympics and that more games would be held every two years as a &quot;Biennial International Special Olympics&quot;. Hayden served as the games executive director through 1972, and then in international development for the games.

In 1971, The U.S. Olympic Committee gave the Special Olympics official approval to use the name &quot;Olympics&quot;. France sent the first athletes from outside North America to the second games held in 1970. The third games in 1972 saw 10 nations send athletes The first Special Olympics World Winter Games were held in February 1977 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, U.S. The United Nations declared 1986, the year of the Special Olympics. In 1988, the Special Olympics was officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The first World Games held outside the U.S., were the winter games of 1993 in Salzburg and Schladming, Austria. The Austrian president was the first head of state to personally open the games.

In 1997, Healthy Athletes became an official Special Olympics initiative, offering health information and screenings to Special Olympics athletes worldwide. By 2010, the Healthy Athletes program had given free health screenings and treatment to more than 1 million people with intellectual disabilities.
The 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games—the first summer held outside of the United States—took place in Dublin, Ireland. Approximately 7,000 athletes from 150 countries competed over 18 disciplines. The Dublin games were also the first to have their own opening and closing ceremonies broadcast live. President of Ireland Mary McAleese performed the ceremonial duties. The 2003 games dramatically changed the perceptions and attitudes of international society regarding the abilities and limitations of people with intellectual disabilities. The opening ceremony of the 2003 Games has been described by President McAleese as &quot;a time when Ireland was at its superb best&quot;.

On October 30, 2004, President George W. Bush signed into law the &quot;Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act&quot;, Public Law 108–406. The bill authorized funding for its Healthy Athletes, Education, and Worldwide Expansion programs. Co-sponsored by Representatives Roy Blunt (R-MO), and Steny Hoyer (D-MD), and Senators Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Harry Reid (D-NV), the bills were passed by unanimous consent in both chambers. In July 2006, the first Special Olympics USA Games were held at Iowa State University. Teams from all 50 states and the District of Columbia participated.

In May 2016, Mary Davis of Dublin, Ireland, was named chief executive officer. She is the first CEO from outside the U.S. in the organization&#x27;s history. From 2017 to 2019, US Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos attempted to eliminate federal funding for the Special Olympics. Each year the attempt was rejected by Congress, and the public outcry following a third annual attempt resulted in the funding being maintained in 2019. As part of the Special Olympics 50th Anniversary celebration in 2018, a new mission called the &quot;Inclusion Revolution&quot; was launched.

==Symbols==
The Special Olympics logo is based on the sculpture &quot;Joy and Happiness to All the Children of the World&quot; by Zurab Tsereteli. The State University of New York, Brockport played host to the 1979 Summer Games and Tsereteli was then a visiting artist in residence at the university. He worked with the Kennedy Foundation and gifted the sculpture to the University. The &quot;stick figure&quot; is an abstract but humanistic form designed to convey the impression of movement and activity. The logo is meant to be a symbol of growth, confidence and joy among children and adults with disabilities.

In 2018, the Chicago Park District dedicated the &quot;Eternal Flame of Hope&quot; in honor of the Special Olympics. The sculpture by Richard Hunt stands in a plaza next to Soldier Field, where the first games were held 50 years earlier in 1968. The Flame of Hope is the name given to the torch that is carried to and lit at Special Olympics games.

== Hosts of the Special Olympics World Games ==

1 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, was originally selected to host the 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games. Due to financial problems and the constant delay in reconstruction of the venues of the 1984 Winter Olympics, the city gave up hosting the Games, and Boise, Idaho, was invited to host the event.

2 It was planned that Åre and Östersund, Sweden would host the 2021 World Winter Games between February 2 to 13, 2021. However, on December 20, 2019, it was announced that the Swedish Paralympic Committee vetoed the necessary financing for the continuity of the event in the country, invalidating a promise made during the bid process, Special Olympics was forced to delay the event and in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic arose. Kazan, Russia was announced winter host for 2022 on June 29, 2020. On March 4, 2022, it was announced that the Kazan games would be cancelled due to safety and economic concerns arising from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==National programs==
As of May 2023, there are 204 countries and territories, grouped into seven geographic regions. Due to legal issues, eight national programs don&#x27;t use the official names of their countries in English but instead use their official names in their local languages.

==Participation==
Special Olympics programs are available for athletes free of charge. More than 5.7 million athletes and Unified Sports partners are involved in Special Olympics sports training and competition in 204 countries and territories. The organization offers year-round training and competition in 32 Olympic-style summer and winter sports.
People with intellectual disabilities are encouraged to join the Special Olympics for the physical activity, which helps lower the rate of cardiovascular disease and obesity, among other health benefits. Also, they gain many emotional and psychological benefits, including self-confidence, social competence, building greater athletic skills and higher self-esteem. Exercise has also been shown to be related to a decrease in anxiety levels amongst people with intellectual disabilities.

To participate in the Special Olympics, a person must be at least 8 years old and identified by an agency or professional as having one of the following conditions: intellectual disabilities, cognitive delays as measured by formal assessment, or significant learning or vocational problems due to cognitive delay that require or have required specially designed instruction. For young people with and without intellectual disabilities ages 2–7, Special Olympics has a Young Athletes program—an inclusive sport and play program with a focus on activities that are important to mental and physical growth. Children engage in games and activities that develop motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Parents say their children in Young Athletes also develop better social skills. The confidence boost makes it easier for them to play and talk with other children on the playground and elsewhere. A study by the Center for Social Development and Education (University of Massachusetts, Boston) found that the activities also had the effect of helping children with intellectual disabilities learn routines and approaches to learning, along with how to follow rules and directions.

Families can also get involved with the Special Olympics experience. Family members support their athletes to the best of their ability, which may involve attending or volunteering at the events. By being involved they can boost their athlete&#x27;s self-esteem and will be looked at as a constant source of encouragement.

Volunteers and supporters are an integral part of Special Olympics—and millions of people around the world are committed to its programs. Some are sponsors or donors. Many others are coaches, event volunteers and fans.

Coaches help the athletes be the best they can be regardless of ability—or disability. Special Olympics trains coaches through the Coaching Excellence program, which includes partnering with sports organizations. Special Olympics volunteers are introduced to lifetime friendships and great rewards.

There are many events in which families and volunteers participate, but the biggest event is the Law Enforcement Torch Run, which involves police chiefs, police officers, secret service, FBI agents, military police, sheriffs, state troopers, prison guards, and other law enforcement personnel assembling to raise awareness and funds for Special Olympics. Ahead of a Special Olympics competition, law enforcement officers carry the torch in intervals along a planned route covering most of the state or country to the site of the opening ceremonies of the chapter or Special Olympics World Summer or Winter Games. Then they pass the torch to a Special Olympics athlete and together they run up to the cauldron and light it, signifying the beginning of the games.

The Special Olympics athlete&#x27;s oath, which was first introduced by Eunice Kennedy Shriver at the inaugural Special Olympics international games in Chicago in 1968, is &quot;Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.&quot; The origin of the oath came from Herbert J. Kramer, then Public Relations Advisor to the Kennedy Foundation.

==Sports offered==
In 1968, track and field, swimming, and floor hockey were the first three official sports offered by Special Olympics. As in the Olympics, events are introduced in training and then added to the competitive schedule, and from there the list of sports and events continued to grow.

Special Olympics has more than 30 Olympic-type individual and team sports that provide meaningful training and competition opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. , these are:
* Athletics (Track and field)
* Basketball
* Bocce
* Bowling
* Cricket
* Cycling
* Equestrian
* Figure skating
* Floorball
* Floor hockey
* Football (Soccer)
* Golf
* Gymnastics: Artistic and rhythmic
* Handball
* Judo
* Karate
* Kayaking
* Netball
* Powerlifting
* Roller skating
* Sailing
* Snowboarding
* Snowshoe running
* Skiing: Alpine and cross-country
* Softball
* Speed skating: Short-track
* Swimming: Pool and open-water
* Table tennis
* Tennis
* Triathlon
* Volleyball
Other sports and sports-related programs include the Motor Activity Training Program and beach volleyball. Availability of sports can depend on location and season.

A key difference between Special Olympics competitions and those of other sports organizations is that athletes of all ability levels are encouraged to participate. Competitions are structured so that athletes compete with other athletes of similar ability in equitable divisions. An athlete&#x27;s ability is the primary factor in divisioning Special Olympics competitions. The ability of an athlete or team is determined by an entry score from a prior competition or the result of a seeding round or preliminary event at the competition itself. Other factors that are significant in establishing competitive divisions are age and gender.

At competitions, medals are awarded for first, second, and third place in each event, and ribbons are awarded to athletes who finish in fourth through eighth place.

==Unified Sports==
In recent years, Special Olympics has pioneered the concept of Unified Sports, bringing together athletes with and without intellectual disabilities as teammates. The basic concept is that training together and playing together can create a path to friendship and understanding. The program has expanded beyond the U.S. and North America: more than 1.4 million people worldwide now take part in Special Olympics Unified Sports. The goal is to break down stereotypes about people with intellectual disabilities and promote unity.

Building on this, Special Olympics launched &quot;The Revolution Is Inclusion&quot;, inviting people worldwide to sign the Inclusion Pledge. This campaign aimed at celebrating all abilities began as Special Olympics marked its 50th anniversary.

A recent study of Special Olympics Unified Sports in Serbia, Poland, Ukraine, Germany and Hungary documented the benefits of Unified Sports, including the effect of changing attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities. As one Unified Sports partner said, &quot;I am ashamed to say that I used to laugh at these people (people with intellectual disabilities), now I will tell anybody to stop laughing if I see it and I will stand up for people if I can.&quot; Other evaluations have also shown Unified Sports to be successful in building self-esteem and confidence in people with intellectual disabilities and also as a way to improve understanding and acceptance of people with intellectual disabilities among their non-disabled peers.

The Special Olympics Europe Eurasia Regional Research centre is based at the University of Ulster Jordanstown.

As part of their 50th anniversary, the Special Olympics created the first Unified Cup. The first competition is a soccer tournament with 440 athletes from 24 countries.

Unified Robotics, a program that pairs Special Olympics students with FIRST Robotics students to build robots, began in 2016, and has been bringing opportunities for technological skill development to Special Olympics students in Washington state, Arizona, and in other regions since. Special Olympics Arizona also promotes inclusion through Unified Arts programming including robotics, music, photography, art competitions, and gardening.

==Healthy Athletes==
As the Special Olympics began to grow, staffers and volunteers began to notice that athletes—children and adults with intellectual disabilities—also had many untreated health problems. In 1997, Special Olympics began an initiative called Healthy Athletes, which offers health screenings to athletes in need.

Healthy Athletes currently offers health screenings in eight areas: Fit Feet (podiatry), FUNfitness (physical therapy), Health Promotion (better health and well-being), Healthy Hearing (audiology), MedFest (sports physical exam), Opening Eyes (vision), Special Smiles (dentistry), Strong Minds (Emotional Health). Screenings educate athletes on health and also identify problems that may need additional follow-up. For example, the FUNfitness Program assess flexibility, strength, balance, and aerobic fitness of the athlete. Following the screen, the physical therapist would provide instructions on how to optimize their physical fitness in the areas screened.

Since the Healthy Athletes program began, Special Olympics has become the largest global public health organization dedicated to serving people with intellectual disabilities. So far, more than 1.9 million Healthy Athletes screenings have been conducted for people with intellectual disabilities all around the world.

The Special Olympics health initiative has attracted high-profile partners, including the Hear the World Foundation, which screened more than 1,000 athletes during the most recent World Winter Games in Korea; more than 200 of them were found to have hearing loss.

In 2012, the Special Olympics Healthy Communities initiative launched in eight countries—Kazakhstan, Malawi, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Romania, South Africa and Thailand, as well as six U.S. states. The goal is to improve the health and well-being of people with intellectual disabilities and allow them to reach their full potential.

==Criticism==
Scholar Keith Storey summarized common objections in a 2004 article in &quot;Journal of Disability Policy Studies&quot;. One criticism directed at the organization pertains to the role that corporate sponsors play in it, which critics feel has led to degrading paternalism toward athletic ability. While corporate fundraising makes the games possible, critics argue, it provides good public relations for the sponsors, but does not result in integration of people with disabilities into the workforce at those companies. People with disabilities are also not widely represented on the Special Olympics&#x27; board of directors, as only two members have disabilities. This has been criticized as a double standard that reflects poorly on the disability rights movement where people with disabilities control the service delivery system rather than relying on people without disabilities.

<text>Nelly Kim Furtado ( , ; born December 2, 1978) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. She has sold over 45 million records, including 35 million in album sales worldwide, making her one of the most successful Canadian artists. Critics have noted Furtado&#x27;s musical versatility and experimentation with genres.

Furtado first gained fame with her trip hop-inspired debut album, &quot;Whoa, Nelly!&quot; (2000), which was a critical and commercial success that spawned two top-10 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;I&#x27;m Like a Bird&quot; and &quot;Turn Off the Light&quot;. The former won her a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Furtado&#x27;s introspective folk-heavy 2003 second album, &quot;Folklore&quot;, explored her Portuguese roots. Its singles received moderate success in Europe, but the album&#x27;s underperformance compared to her debut was regarded as a sophomore slump.

Furtado&#x27;s third album, &quot;Loose&quot; (2006), was a smash hit and became her bestselling album, with more than 10 million copies sold worldwide, also making it one of the bestselling albums of the 2000s. Considered a radical image reinvention, the album spawned four successful number-one singles worldwide: &quot;Promiscuous&quot; (featuring Timbaland), &quot;Maneater&quot;, &quot;Say It Right&quot;, and &quot;All Good Things (Come to an End)&quot;. Her 2007 feature on Timbaland&#x27;s &quot;Give It to Me&quot; in the same era also topped the charts in the US and overseas. Furtado&#x27;s critically acclaimed duet with James Morrison, &quot;Broken Strings&quot;, also topped the charts in Europe in 2008.

She released her first Spanish-language album, &quot;Mi Plan&quot;, in 2009, which won her a Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album. In 2012, Furtado released her nostalgia-inspired fifth album &quot;The Spirit Indestructible&quot;. Furtado split with her management and went independent thereafter, releasing her indie-pop sixth album, &quot;The Ride&quot;, in 2017 under her own label Nelstar Entertainment. Her seventh album, &quot;7&quot;, was released on 20 September 2024.

She has won many awards throughout her career, including one Grammy Award from seven nominations, one Latin Grammy Award, ten Juno Awards, one BRIT Award, one &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award, one MTV Europe Music Award, one World Music Award, and three Much Music Video Awards. Furtado has a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, and was awarded Commander of the Order of Prince Henry on February 28, 2014, by Aníbal Cavaco Silva, the then-President of Portugal.

== Early life ==
Furtado was born on December 2, 1978, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Her Portuguese parents, António José Furtado and Maria Manuela Furtado, were born on São Miguel Island in the Azores and had immigrated to Canada in the late 1960s. Nelly was named after Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim. Her elder siblings are Michael Anthony and Lisa Anne. They were raised Roman Catholic. At age four, she began performing and singing in Portuguese. Furtado&#x27;s first public performance was when she sang a duet with her mother at a church on Portugal Day. She began playing musical instruments at the age of nine, learning the trombone, ukulele and, in later years, the guitar and keyboards. At the age of 12, she began writing songs, and as a teenager, she performed in a Portuguese marching band. Furtado has acknowledged her family as the source of her strong work ethic; she spent eight summers working as a chambermaid with her mother, along with her brother and sister, who was a housekeeper in Victoria.

== Career ==
=== 1996–1999: Career beginnings ===
After graduating from Mount Douglas Secondary School in 1996, she moved to Toronto to reside with her sister. There, she got a full-time job at an alarm company. Later, she would meet Tallis Newkirk, member of the hip hop group Plains of Fascination. She contributed vocals to their 1996 album, &quot;Join the Ranks&quot;, on the track &quot;Waitin&#x27; 4 the Streets&quot;. The following year, she formed Nelstar, a trip hop duo with Newkirk. Ultimately, Furtado felt the trip hop style of the duo was &quot;too segregated&quot;, and believed it did not represent her personality or allow her to showcase her vocal ability. She left the group and planned to move back home.

In 1997, she performed at the Honey Jam talent show. Her performance attracted the attention of The Philosopher Kings singer Gerald Eaton, who then approached her to write with him. He and fellow Kings member Brian West helped Furtado produce a demo. She left Toronto, but returned again to record more material with Eaton and West. The material recorded during these sessions was shopped to record companies by her attorney Chris Taylor and led to her 1999 record deal with DreamWorks Records, signed by A&amp;R executive Beth Halper, partner of Garbage drummer and record producer Butch Vig. Furtado&#x27;s first single, &quot;Party&#x27;s Just Begun (Again)&quot;, was released that year on the soundtrack album for &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot; (1999).

=== 2000–2005: &quot;Whoa, Nelly!&quot; and &quot;Folklore&quot; ===
Furtado continued the collaboration with Eaton and West, who co-produced her debut album, &quot;Whoa, Nelly!&quot;, which was released in October 2000. The album was an international success, supported by three international singles: &quot;I&#x27;m Like a Bird&quot;, &quot;Turn Off the Light&quot;, and &quot;...On the Radio (Remember the Days)&quot;. It received four Grammy nominations in 2002, and her debut single won for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Furtado&#x27;s work was also critically acclaimed for her innovative mixture of various genres and sounds. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; called the album &quot;a delightful and refreshing antidote to the army of &#x27;pop princesses&#x27; and rap-metal bands that had taken over popular music at the turn of the millennium&quot;. The sound of the album was strongly influenced by musicians who had traversed cultures and &quot;the challenge of making heartfelt, emotional music that&#x27;s upbeat and hopeful&quot;. According to &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine, &quot;Whoa, Nelly!&quot; had sold six million copies worldwide as of August 2006. Portions of the song &quot;Scared of You&quot; are in Portuguese, while &quot;Onde Estás&quot; is entirely in Portuguese, reflecting Furtado&#x27;s Portuguese heritage. Following the release of the album, Furtado headlined the &quot;Burn in the Spotlight Tour&quot; and also appeared on Moby&#x27;s &quot;Area:One&quot; tour.

In 2002, Furtado appeared on the song &quot;Thin Line&quot;, on underground hip hop group Jurassic 5&#x27;s album &quot;Power in Numbers&quot;. The same year, Furtado provided her vocals to the Paul Oakenfold song &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; from the album &quot;Bunkka&quot;. She also had a collaboration with Colombian artist Juanes in the song &quot;Fotografía&quot; (&quot;Photograph&quot;), where she showed her diversity of yet another language, Spanish. Furtado was also featured in &quot;Breath&quot; from Swollen Members&#x27; &quot;Monsters in the Closet&quot; release; the video for &quot;Breath&quot;, directed by Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, won the 2003 Western Canadian Music Awards Outstanding Video and MuchVIBE Best Rap Video. In 2002, Furtado was the recipient of an International Achievement Award at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto for her song &quot;I&#x27;m Like a Bird&quot;.

Furtado&#x27;s second album, &quot;Folklore&quot;, was released in November 2003. One of the tracks on the album, &quot;Childhood Dreams&quot;, was dedicated to her daughter, Nevis. The album includes the single &quot;Força&quot;, the official anthem of the UEFA Euro 2004. Furtado performed the song in Lisbon in the final of the tournament, in which Portugal&#x27;s national team played. The lead single released was &quot;Powerless (Say What You Want)&quot; and the second single was the ballad &quot;Try&quot;. The album was not as successful as her debut, partly due to the album&#x27;s less &quot;poppy&quot; sound, as well as underpromotion from her label DreamWorks Records. DreamWorks had just been sold to Universal Music Group at the time of the album&#x27;s release. Eventually in 2005, DreamWorks Records, along with many of its artists, including Furtado, were absorbed into Geffen Records. &quot;Powerless (Say What You Want)&quot; was later remixed into a Spanish version called &quot;Abre Tu Corazón&quot;, featuring Juanes, who had previously worked with Furtado on his track &quot;Fotografía&quot;. The two would collaborate again on &quot;Te Busqué&quot; (&quot;I Searched for You&quot;), a single from Furtado&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Loose&quot;. In 2003, Furtado won an International Achievement Award at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto for her song &quot;Turn Off the Light&quot;.

=== 2006–2008: &quot;Loose&quot; ===

Furtado&#x27;s third album, named &quot;Loose&quot;, after the spontaneous, creative decisions she made while creating the album, was released in June 2006. In this album, primarily produced by Timbaland, Furtado experiments with sounds from R&amp;B, hip hop, and 1980s music. Furtado herself describes the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;punk-hop&quot;, described as &quot;modern, poppy, spooky&quot; and as having &quot;a mysterious, after-midnight vibe... extremely visceral&quot;. She attributed the youthful sound of the album to the presence of her two-year-old daughter. The album received generally positive reviews from critics, with some citing the &quot;revitalising&quot; effect of Timbaland on Furtado&#x27;s music, and others calling it &quot;slick, smart and surprising&quot;.

&quot;Loose&quot; has become the most successful album of Furtado&#x27;s career so far, as it reached number one, not only in Canada and the United States, but also several countries worldwide. The album produced her first number-one hit in the United States, &quot;Promiscuous&quot;, as well as her first number-one hit in the United Kingdom, &quot;Maneater&quot;. The single &quot;Say It Right&quot; eventually became Furtado&#x27;s most successful song worldwide, due to its huge success in Europe and in the United States, where it became her second number-one hit. &quot;All Good Things (Come to an End)&quot; became her most successful song in Europe, topping single charts in numerous countries there. On February 16, 2007, Furtado embarked on the &quot;Get Loose Tour&quot;. She returned in March 2007 to her hometown of Victoria to perform a concert at the Save-On Foods Memorial Centre. In honour of her visit, local leaders officially proclaimed March 21, 2007, the first day of spring, as Nelly Furtado Day. After the tour, she released her first live DVD/CD named &quot;Loose the Concert&quot;. On April 1, 2007, Furtado was a performer and host of the 2007 Juno Awards in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. She won all five awards for which she was nominated, including Album of the Year and Single of the Year. She also appeared on stage at the Concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium in London on July 1, 2007, where she performed &quot;Say It Right&quot;, &quot;Maneater&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Like a Bird&quot;.

In 2007, Furtado and Justin Timberlake were featured on Timbaland&#x27;s single &quot;Give It to Me&quot;, which became her third number-one single in the U.S. and second in the UK. In late 2008, Furtado collaborated with James Morrison on a song called &quot;Broken Strings&quot; for his album &quot;Songs for You, Truths for Me&quot;. The single was released on December 8 and peaked at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in early January. In 2008, she sang with the Italian group Zero Assoluto the ballad &quot;Win or Lose – Appena prima di partire&quot;, released in Italy, France and Germany and whose video was shot in Barcelona. Furtado made a guest appearance on the song &quot;Jump&quot; by Flo Rida from his album &quot;R.O.O.T.S.&quot;, and also made a guest appearance on Divine Brown&#x27;s &quot;Love Chronicles&quot;, co-writing and singing on the background of the song &quot;Sunglasses&quot;. Furtado married Cuban sound engineer Demacio &quot;Demo&quot; Castellón, with whom she had worked on the &quot;Loose&quot; album, on July 19, 2008.

=== 2009–2011: &quot;Mi Plan&quot; and &quot;The Best of Nelly Furtado&quot; ===

Furtado&#x27;s debut Spanish album, &quot;Mi Plan&quot; was released with the first single, &quot;Manos Al Aire&quot; (&quot;Hands in the Air&quot;). She had formed her own record label, Nelstar, in conjunction with Canadian independent label group Last Gang Labels. The first act signed to Nelstar is Fritz Helder &amp; the Phantoms. &quot;Manos al Aire&quot; was released on the new label. The second, third and fourth singles were &quot;Más&quot;, &quot;Mi Plan&quot; and &quot;Bajo Otra Luz&quot; respectively. Furtado won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album for &quot;Mi Plan&quot;. She is the first Portuguese-Canadian to win a Latin Grammy award. &quot;Lifestyle&quot;, her planned fourth English studio album, was not released during the summer of 2010 in favor a second leg of her Mi Plan Tour. To promote the tour in Brazil, on March 24, 2010, Furtado made a &quot;VIP Pocket Show&quot; in reality show program &quot;Big Brother Brasil 10&quot; from Rede Globo, the country&#x27;s leading channel. Furtado participated in the live DVD recording of the Brazilian singer Ivete Sangalo in Madison Square Garden on September 4, 2010.

Furtado released &quot;Mi Plan Remixes&quot; featuring 12 tracks of remixed hits from &quot;Mi Plan&quot;. This album included the Original Spanglish Version of &quot;Fuerte&quot;, her final release from &quot;Mi Plan&quot;. Furtado made a guest appearance on Canadian singer k-os&#x27;s new album &quot;Yes!&quot;, collaborating alongside Saukrates on the song &quot;I Wish I Knew Natalie Portman&quot;, released in early July 2009. Nelly Furtado also made a guest appearance on Tiësto&#x27;s single &quot;Who Wants to Be Alone&quot; on his new album &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;. Furtado sang in a duet with Bryan Adams at the opening ceremonies of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games. The song was called &quot;Bang the Drum&quot; released on EMI album &quot;Sounds Of Vancouver 2010&quot; (a commemorative album). Furtado was featured in a new song by N.E.R.D called &quot;Hot-n-Fun&quot;. She also participated in the Young Artists for Haiti song, in which many Canadian artists came together and sang K&#x27;naan&#x27;s song &quot;Wavin&#x27; Flag&quot; to raise money for the victims of the Haiti earthquake. Furtado was honoured with a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in October 2010.

Furtado released her first greatest hits album titled &quot;The Best of Nelly Furtado&quot; on November 16, 2010. Three new songs were included on the greatest hits album, including &quot;Night Is Young&quot;, &quot;Girlfriend in the City&quot;, and the Lester Mendez produced track, left over from the &quot;Loose&quot; sessions, &quot;Stars&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Night Is Young&quot;, was released on October 12, 2010. Furtado had previously sung two of the new songs: &quot;Girlfriend in the City&quot; and &quot;Night Is Young&quot; at her concert in Warsaw, Poland.
Furtado came under fire after 2011 reports from the &quot;New York Times&quot; and a WikiLeaks document revealed she had accepted payment of one million dollars to perform for the family of Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi. Only after the story broke did she promise to donate to charity the CDN$1 million she received for a 2007 concert, which ended up going to Free the Children. Furtado publicly endorsed Green Party leader Elizabeth May in Saanich-Gulf Islands during the federal election in 2011. Furtado was featured on one of the Game&#x27;s The R.E.D. Album tracks, titled &quot;Mamma Knows&quot; (produced by The Neptunes). For the Canadian film The Year Dolly Parton Was My Mom, Furtado lent her vocals for the Dolly Parton gospel cover &quot;The Seeker&quot; featured during the credits of the film.

=== 2012–2013: &quot;The Spirit Indestructible&quot; ===

Furtado collaborated with recording artist Alex Cuba and K&#x27;naan again. The duet with K&#x27;naan, &quot;Is Anybody Out There&quot;, was released as the first single from his extended play &quot;More Beautiful than Silence&quot;. The song topped the charts in New Zealand and was successful in European territories as well as her native Canada. It also charted on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;The Spirit Indestructible&quot; was released in September 2012. Furtado previously proclaimed that the album was most like her 2000 debut &quot;Whoa, Nelly!&quot;, but containing elements from urban, alternative, and reggae. The influences for the album range from Janelle Monáe, The xx, to Florence + the Machine. The album had input from producers such as The Neptunes, Tiësto, Timbaland, Rick Nowels, Ryan Tedder and Rodney Jerkins.

The first single from &quot;The Spirit Indestructible&quot;, &quot;Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)&quot;, was released digitally on April 17, 2012 and was sent to North American radio stations on May 1, 2012. The song was commercially successful in the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands, but underperformed in other territories. The second single and title track performed well in Germany and Slovakia and charted in Japan, peaking at number 79 on the Hot 100. Other singles, &quot;Parking Lot&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the Night&quot;, charted in Canada and several European territories.

Furtado continued to collaborate with hip-hop producer Salaam Remi, who previously worked on the 2010 single &quot;Night Is Young&quot;, on &quot;The Edge&quot;. The lyrics for the Salaam Remi produced track are reported to be influenced by the Tiger Woods cheating scandal, in which was originally referred to as &quot;Elin&#x27;s Song&quot;. Furtado promoted the album on her The Spirit Indestructible Tour.

=== 2014–2019: Independence and &quot;The Ride&quot; ===

In February 2015, Furtado co-headlined Switzerlands Art on Ice tour with Tom Odell. In 2016, Furtado appeared in a minor supporting role in the romantic comedy film &quot;A Date with Miss Fortune&quot;.

On February 14, 2016, Furtado performed the Canadian national anthem at the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, which was held in Toronto (this was the second time Furtado had performed at the NBA All-Star Game, also having performed &quot;O Canada&quot; at the 2004 NBA All-Star Game). That same month, she also began teasing new music via social media, suggesting that the album would have a connection to Dallas, Texas, where much of the album was recorded. In 2016, Furtado collaborated with Dev Hynes on the track &quot;Hadron Collider&quot;. The track appears on Hynes&#x27; album &quot;Freetown Sound&quot;.

In July 2016, Furtado released &quot;Behind Your Back&quot; exclusively on Spotify, describing the song as an &quot;appetiser&quot; for her next album. Following the release, in an interview with CBC Player, Furtado stated that her album is finished and she has recorded 16 songs with John Congleton, but the album will contain 12. On September 8, 2016, Furtado confirmed the title of the upcoming album, &quot;The Ride&quot;, which was released in March 2017. During the interview she also confirmed a new track off the album titled &quot;Islands of Me&quot;, which was released on streaming services on September 10, 2016. The album&#x27;s first released song &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; was released to SoundCloud on November 8, 2016, with the release accompanied by a short teaser video of the album on YouTube. The cover song &quot;Sticks &amp; Stones&quot; from her album was re-made by Metro with newly recorded vocals by Furtado in May 2018. It later reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart. The official remixes include StoneBridge, Bimbo Jones, Manuel Riva &amp; Cristian Poow.

In September 2003, Furtado gave birth to a daughter with her then boyfriend Jasper Gahunia. They dated for several years and were friends prior. The couple broke up in 2005, though according to Furtado in a 2006 interview, remain friends and share joint responsibility of raising their daughter. On July 19, 2008, Furtado married sound engineer Demacio Castellon, with whom she had worked on &quot;Loose&quot;. In April 2017, during an appearance on the British daytime panel show &quot;Loose Women&quot;, Furtado announced she had separated from Castellon during the summer of 2016 and said she is now single. In December 2021, Furtado revealed on her Instagram account that she has two more children, the oldest being a girl and the youngest being a boy, as she revealed in July 2023 during an interview with Vogue where she also revealed she is single again. The father of her second and third children is American rapper Hodgy.

In a June 2006 interview with &quot;Genre&quot; magazine, when asked if she had &quot;ever felt an attraction to women&quot;, Furtado replied, &quot;Absolutely. Women are beautiful and sexy&quot;. Some considered this an announcement of bisexuality, but, in August 2006, she stated that she was &quot;straight, but very open-minded&quot;.

In November 2006, Furtado revealed that she once turned down US$500,000 to pose fully clothed in &quot;Playboy&quot;. In September 2009, she revealed the reason of this turn down was because she didn&#x27;t want &quot;Playboy&quot; on her resume at 22 because it was too much too soon, but that she would probably say yes if asked at age 40.

Furtado learned Portuguese up to the age of 12. She studied Spanish in high school and in 2009 estimated that her command of it was fifty to sixty percent.

As of March 2017, Furtado has stated that she resides in Toronto and New York City. In an April 2017 interview with &quot;DIY&quot; magazine, Furtado revealed she had purchased an apartment in New York City.

In May 2023, during an interview with &quot;Fault&quot; magazine, Furtado revealed she had recently been diagnosed with ADHD.

== Philanthropy ==

In 2007, Furtado hosted a program about AIDS on MTV, which also featured guests Justin Timberlake and Alicia Keys. On September 27, 2011, Furtado announced during Free the Children&#x27;s We Day, that she was giving CDN$1,000,000 to Free the Children&#x27;s effort to build girls&#x27; schools in the Maasai region of Kenya.

Furtado is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

== Artistry ==
Furtado possesses a mezzo-soprano voice. Kristie Rohwedder of &quot;Bustle Magazine&quot; characterizes it as &quot;soaring&quot; while Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; calls it &quot;nasally&quot;. During her childhood and youth, Furtado embraced many musical genres, listening heavily to mainstream rock, R&amp;B, hip hop, alternative hip hop, drum and bass, trip hop, world music (including Portuguese fado, Brazilian bossa nova and Indian music), and a variety of others. Her biggest influence when growing up was Ani DiFranco; she explained that &quot;[w]hen I was a teenager, I wanted to be Ani DiFranco. I never wanted to be part of corporate music.&quot; She cites diverse influences, including Madonna, Mariah Carey, Blondie, Prince, The Police, Eurythmics, Talking Heads, De La Soul, TLC, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Amália Rodrigues, Caetano Veloso, Juanes, Jeff Buckley, Esthero, Björk, Cornershop, Oasis, Radiohead, The Smashing Pumpkins, U2 and Beck.

Furtado&#x27;s work has also inspired the likes of Lorde, Slayyyter, Dua Lipa, Bridgit Mendler, Gia Woods and Billie Eilish.

<text>&quot;Do it yourself&quot; (&quot;DIY&quot;) is the method of building, , or repairing things by oneself without the direct aid of professionals or certified experts. Academic research has described DIY as behaviors where &quot;individuals use raw and semi-raw materials and parts to produce, transform, or reconstruct material possessions, including those drawn from the natural environment (e.g., landscaping)&quot;. DIY behavior can be triggered by various motivations previously categorized as marketplace motivations (economic benefits, lack of product availability, lack of product quality, need for customization), and identity enhancement (craftsmanship, empowerment, community seeking, uniqueness).

The term &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; has been associated with consumers since at least 1912 primarily in the domain of home improvement and maintenance activities. The phrase &quot;do it yourself&quot; had come into common usage (in standard English) by the 1950s, in reference to the emergence of a trend of people undertaking home improvement and various other small craft and construction projects as both a creative-recreational and cost-saving activity.

Subsequently, the term DIY has taken on a broader meaning that covers a wide range of skill sets. DIY has been described as a &quot;self-made-culture&quot;; one of designing, creating, customizing and repairing items or things without any special training. DIY has grown to become a social concept with people sharing ideas, designs, techniques, methods and finished projects with one another either online or in person.

DIY can be seen as a cultural reaction in modern technological society to increasing academic specialization and economic specialization which brings people into contact with only a tiny focus area within the larger context, positioning DIY as a venue for holistic engagement. DIY ethic is the ethic of self-sufficiency through completing tasks without the aid of a paid expert. The DIY ethic promotes the idea that anyone is capable of performing a variety of tasks rather than relying on paid specialists.

==History==
Italian archaeologists have unearthed the ruins of a 6th-century BC Greek structure in southern Italy. The ruins appeared to come with detailed assembly instructions and are being called an &quot;ancient IKEA building&quot;. The structure was a temple-like building discovered at Torre Satriano, near the southern city of Potenza, in Basilicata. This region was recognized as a place where local people mingled with Greeks who had settled along the southern coast known as Magna Graecia and in Sicily from the 8th century BC onwards. Christopher Smith, director of the British School at Rome, said that the discovery was, &quot;the clearest example yet found of mason&#x27;s marks of the time. It looks as if someone was instructing others how to mass-produce components and put them together in this way.&quot; Much like our modern instruction booklets, various sections of the luxury building were inscribed with coded symbols showing how the pieces slotted together. The characteristics of these inscriptions indicate they date back to around the 6th century BC, which tallies with the architectural evidence suggested by the decoration. The building was built by Greek artisans coming from the Spartan colony of Taranto in Apulia.

In North America, there was a DIY magazine publishing niche in the first half of the twentieth century. Magazines such as &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; (founded in 1902) and &quot;Mechanix Illustrated&quot; (founded in 1928) offered a way for readers to keep current on useful practical skills, techniques, tools, and materials. As many readers lived in rural or semi-rural regions, initially much of the material related to their needs on the farm or in a small town. In addition, authors such as F. J. Christopher began to become heavy advocates for do-it-yourself projects.

By the 1950s, DIY became common usage with the emergence of people undertaking home improvement projects, construction projects and smaller crafts. Artists began to fight against mass production and mass culture by claiming to be self-made. However, DIY practices also responded to geopolitical tensions, such as in the form of home-made Cold War nuclear fallout shelters, and the dark aesthetics and nihilist discourse in punk fanzines in the 1970s and onwards in the shadow of rising unemployment and social tensions. In the 1960s and 1970s, books and TV shows about the DIY movement and techniques on building and home decoration began appearing. By the 1990s, the DIY movement felt the impact of the digital age with the rise of the internet. With computers and the internet becoming mainstream, increased accessibility to the internet has led to more households undertaking DIY methods. Platforms, such as YouTube or Instagram, provide people the opportunity to share their creations and instruct others on how to replicate DIY techniques in their own home.
The DIY movement is a re-introduction (often to urban and suburban dwellers) of the old pattern of personal involvement and use of skills in the upkeep of a house or apartment, making clothes; maintenance of cars, computers, websites; or any material aspect of living. The philosopher Alan Watts (from the &quot;Houseboat Summit&quot; panel discussion in a 1967 edition of the &quot;San Francisco Oracle&quot;) reflected a growing sentiment:

In the 1970s, DIY spread through the North American population of college and recent-college-graduate age groups. In part, this movement involved the renovation of affordable, rundown older homes. But, it also related to various projects expressing the social and environmental vision of the 1960s and early 1970s. The young visionary Stewart Brand, working with friends and family, and initially using the most basic of typesetting and page-layout tools, published the first edition of &quot;The Whole Earth Catalog&quot; (subtitled &quot;Access to Tools&quot;) in late 1968.

The first &quot;Catalog&quot;, and its successors, used a broad definition of the term &quot;tools.&quot; There were informational tools, such as books (often technical in nature), professional journals, courses and classes. There were specialized, designed items, such as carpentry and stonemasonry tools, garden tools, welding equipment, chainsaws, fiberglass materials and so on – even early personal computers. The designer J. Baldwin served as technology editor and wrote many of the reviews of fabrication tools, tools for working soil, etc. The &quot;Catalog&quot; publication both emerged from and spurred the great wave of experimentalism, convention-breaking, and do-it-yourself attitude of the late 1960s. Often copied, the &quot;Catalog&quot; appealed to a wide cross-section of people in North America and had a broad influence.

DIY home improvement books burgeoned in the 1970s, first created as collections of magazine articles. An early, extensive line of DIY how-to books were created by Sunset Books, based upon previously published articles from their magazine, &quot;Sunset&quot;, based in California. Time-Life, Better Homes and Gardens, Balcony Garden Web and other publishers soon followed suit.
In the mid-1990s, DIY home-improvement content began to find its way onto the World Wide Web. HouseNet was the earliest bulletin-board style site where users could share information. Since the late 1990s, DIY has exploded on the Web through thousands of sites.

In the 1970s, when home video (VCRs) came along, DIY instructors quickly grasped its potential for demonstrating processes by audio-visual means. In 1979, the PBS television series &quot;This Old House&quot;, starring Bob Vila, premiered and spurred a DIY television revolution. The show was immensely popular, educating people on how to improve their living conditions (and the value of their house) without the expense of paying someone else to do (as much of) the work. In 1994, the HGTV Network cable television channel was launched in the United States and Canada, followed in 1999 by the DIY Network cable television channel. Both were launched to appeal to the growing percentage of North Americans interested in DIY topics, from home improvement to knitting. Such channels have multiple shows revealing how to stretch one&#x27;s budget to achieve professional-looking results (&quot;Design Cents&quot;, &quot;Design on a Dime&quot;, etc.) while doing the work yourself. &quot;Toolbelt Diva&quot; specifically caters to female DIYers.

Beyond magazines and television, the scope of home improvement DIY continues to grow online where most mainstream media outlets now have extensive DIY-focused informational websites such as &quot;This Old House&quot;, Martha Stewart, Hometalk, and the DIY Network. These are often extensions of their magazine or television brand. The growth of independent online DIY resources is also spiking. The number of homeowners who blog about their experiences continues to grow, along with DIY websites from smaller organizations.

==Adverse effects of power tool use==

Use of power tools can cause adverse effects on people living nearby. Power tools can produce large amounts of particulates including, ultrafine particles.

Particulates are the most harmful form (other than ultra-fines) of air pollution. Exposure to particulate matter, especially PM2.5 and ultrafine particles (PM0.1), has serious health implications. According to the World Health Organization, there is no safe level of particulate exposure, with these emissions linked to increased risks of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

Many tasks create dust. With high dust levels are caused by one of more the following:

* equipment – high energy tools, such as cut-off saws, grinders, wall chasers and grit blasters produce a lot of dust in a very short time
* work method – dry sweeping can make a lot of dust compared to vacuuming or wet brushing
* work area – the more enclosed a space, the more the dust will build up
* time – the longer you work the more dust there will be
Examples of high dust level tasks include:
* using power tools to cut, grind, drill or prepare a surface
* sanding taped plaster board joints
* dry sweeping

Some power tools are equipped with dust collection system (e.g. HEPA vacuum cleaner) or integrated water delivery system which extract the dust after emission.

While the type of material used will determine the composition of the dust generated, the size and amount of particulates produced are mainly determined by the type of tool used. Implementation of effective dust control measures may also play a role.

Use of angle grinder is not preferred as large amounts of harmful sparks and fumes (and particulates) are generated when compared with using reciprocating saw or band saw. Angle grinders produce sparks when cutting ferrous metals. They also produce shards cutting other materials. The blades themselves may also break. This is a great hazard to the face and eyes especially, as well as other parts of the body.

Modern power tools are mostly equipped with advanced dust control systems, including HEPA-certified dust extractors and integrated water delivery systems, to mitigate the release of harmful particulates. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandates the use of such control measures in environments with high dust levels.

==Fashion==

DIY is prevalent amongst the fashion community, with ideas being shared on social media, such as YouTube, about clothing, jewellery, makeup, and hairstyles. Techniques include distressing and bleaching jeans, redesigning old shirts, and studding denim.

The concept of DIY has also emerged within the art and design community. The terms Hacktivist, Craftivist, or maker have been used to describe creatives working within a DIY framework (Busch). Otto von Busch describes &#x27;Hacktivism&#x27; as &quot;[including] the participant in the process of making, [to give] rise to new attitudes within the &#x27;maker&#x27; or collaborator&quot; (Busch 49). Busch suggests that by engaging in participatory forms of fashion, consumers are able to step away from the idea of &quot;mass-homogenized &#x27;Mc-Fashion (Lee 2003)&quot;, as fashion Hacktivism allows consumers to play a more active role in engaging with the clothes they wear (Busch 32).

== Subculture ==
DIY as a subculture was brought forward by the punk movement of the 1970s. Instead of traditional means of bands reaching their audiences through large music labels, bands began recording, manufacturing albums and merchandise, booking their own tours, and creating opportunities for smaller bands to get wider recognition through repetitive low-cost DIY touring. The burgeoning zine movement took up coverage of and promotion of the underground punk scenes, and significantly altered the way fans interacted with musicians. Zines quickly branched off from being hand-made music magazines to become more personal; they quickly became one of the youth culture&#x27;s gateways to DIY culture. This led to tutorial zines showing others how to make their own shirts, posters, zines, books, food, etc.

The terms &quot;DIY&quot; and &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; are also used to describe:

* Self-publishing books, zines, &quot;doujin&quot;, and alternative comics
* Bands or solo artists releasing their music on self-funded record labels.
* Trading of mixtapes as part of cassette culture
* The international mail art network which circumvents galleries and official art institutions by creating a precursor to social networking.
* Homemade stuffs based on the principles of &quot;Recycle, Reuse &amp; Reduce&quot; (the 3R&#x27;s). A common term in many Environmental movements encouraging people to reuse old, used objects found in their homes and to recycle simple materials like paper.
* Crafts such as knitting, crochet, sewing, handmade jewelry, ceramics
* Designing business cards, invitations and so on
* Creating punk or indie musical merchandise through the use of recycling thrift store or discarded materials, usually decorated with art applied by silk screen.
* Independent game development and game modding
* Contemporary roller derby
* Skateparks built by skateboarders without paid professional assistance
* Building musical electronic circuits such as the Atari Punk Console and create circuit bending noise machines from vintage children toys.
* Modifying (&quot;modding&quot;) common products to allow extended or unintended uses, commonly referred to by the internet term, &quot;life-hacking&quot;. Related to jury-rigging i.e. sloppy/ unlikely mods
* Hobby electronics or in amateur radio equipment producing.
* DIY science: using open-source hardware to make scientific equipment to conduct citizen science or simply low-cost traditional science
** Using low-cost single-board computers, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, as embedded systems with various applications
** DIY bio

* Use of a custom Linux distribution catered for a specific purpose.
* Building a custom synthesizer. 
* Use of FPGAs.
* Privately made firearms
* Taxidermyizing the scores of hunting or fishing expeditions.

===Music===

Much contemporary DIY music has its origins in the late 1970s punk rock subculture. It developed as a way to circumnavigate the corporate mainstream music industry. By controlling the entire production and distribution chain, DIY bands attempt to develop a closer relationship between artists and fans. The DIY ethic gives total control over the final product without need to compromise with record major labels.

According to the punk aesthetic, one can express oneself and produce moving and serious works with limited means. Arguably, the earliest example of this attitude was the punk music scene of the 1970s.

More recently, the orthodox understanding that DIY originates in 1970s punk, with its clearest practices being in the self-produced 7&quot; single and self-published fanzines, has been challenged. As George McKay asks in the title of his 2023 article: &#x27;Was punk DIY? Is DIY punk?&#x27; McKay argues instead for what he terms a &#x27;depunking&#x27; of DIY. 

Riot grrrl, associated with third-wave feminism, also adopted the core values of the DIY punk ethic by leveraging creative ways of communication through zines and other projects.

Adherents of the DIY punk ethic also work collectively. For example, punk impresario David Ferguson&#x27;s CD Presents was a DIY concert production, recording studio, and record label network.

===Film===

A form of independent filmmaking characterized by low budgets, skeleton crews, and simple props using whatever is available.

===By country===

As a means of adaptation during the Cuban Special Period times of economic crisis, &quot;resolver&quot; (&quot;to resolve&quot;) became an important part of Cuban culture. &quot;Resolver&quot; refers to a spirit of resourcefulness and do-it-yourself problem solving.

====India====

Jugaad is a colloquial Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Sindhi and Urdu word, which refers to a non-conventional, frugal innovation, often termed a &quot;hack&quot;. It could also refer to an innovative fix or a simple work-around, a solution that bends the rules, or a resource that can be used in such a way. It is also often used to signify creativity: to make existing things work, or to create new things with meager resources.

====United States====

Rasquache is the English form of the Spanish term &quot;rascuache&quot;, originally with a negative connotation in Mexico it was recontextualized by the Mexican and Chicano arts movement to describe a specific artistic aesthetic, &quot;Rasquachismo&quot;, suited to overcoming material and professional limitations faced by artists in the movement.

<text>The Second Boer War (, , 11 October 189931 May 1902), also known as the Boer War, Transvaal War, Anglo–Boer War, or South African War, was a conflict fought between the British Empire and the two Boer republics (the South African Republic and Orange Free State) over the Empire&#x27;s influence in Southern Africa.

The Witwatersrand Gold Rush caused a large influx of &quot;foreigners&quot; (&quot;Uitlanders&quot;) to the South African Republic (SAR), mostly British from the Cape Colony. As they, for fear of a hostile takeover of the SAR, were permitted to vote only after fourteen years of residence, they protested to the British authorities in the Cape. Negotiations failed at the botched Bloemfontein Conference in June 1899. The conflict broke out in October after the British government decided to send 10,000 troops to South Africa. With a delay, this provoked a Boer and British ultimatum and subsequent Boer irregulars and militia attacks on British colonial settlements in Natal Colony. The Boers placed Ladysmith, Kimberley, and Mafeking under siege, and won victories at Colenso, Magersfontein and Stormberg. Increased numbers of British Army soldiers were brought to Southern Africa and mounted unsuccessful attacks against the Boers.

However, British fortunes changed when their commanding officer, General Redvers Buller, was replaced by Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener, who relieved the besieged cities and invaded the Boer republics in early 1900 at the head of a 180,000-strong expeditionary force. The Boers, aware they were unable to resist such a large force, refrained from fighting pitched battles, allowing the British to occupy both republics and their capitals, Pretoria and Bloemfontein. Boer politicians, including President of the South African Republic Paul Kruger, either fled or went into hiding; the British Empire officially annexed the two republics in 1900. In Britain, the Conservative ministry led by Lord Salisbury attempted to capitalise on British military successes by calling an early general election, dubbed by contemporary observers a &quot;khaki election&quot;. However, Boer fighters took to the hills and launched a guerrilla campaign, becoming known as &quot;bittereinders&quot;. Led by generals such as Louis Botha, Jan Smuts, Christiaan de Wet, and Koos de la Rey, Boer guerrillas used hit-and-run attacks and ambushes against the British for two years.

The guerrilla campaign proved difficult for the British to defeat, due to unfamiliarity with guerrilla tactics and extensive support for the guerrillas among civilians. In response to failures to defeat the guerrillas, British high command ordered scorched earth policies as part of a large scale and multi-pronged counterinsurgency campaign; a network of nets, blockhouses, strongpoints and barbed wire fences was constructed, virtually partitioning the occupied republics. Over 100,000 Boer civilians, mostly women and children, were forcibly relocated into concentration camps, where 26,000 died, mostly by starvation and disease. Black Africans were interned in concentration camps to prevent them from supplying the Boers; 20,000 died. British mounted infantry were deployed to track down guerrillas, leading to small-scale skirmishes. Few combatants on either side were killed in action, with most casualties dying from disease. Kitchener offered generous terms of surrender to remaining Boer leaders to end the conflict. Eager to ensure fellow Boers were released from the camps, most Boer commanders accepted the British terms in the Treaty of Vereeniging, surrendering in May 1902. The former republics were transformed into the British colonies of the Transvaal and Orange River, and in 1910 were merged with the Natal and Cape Colonies to form the Union of South Africa, a self-governing dominion within the British Empire.

British expeditionary efforts were aided significantly by colonial forces from the Cape Colony, the Natal, Rhodesia, and many volunteers from the British Empire worldwide, particularly Australia, Canada, India and New Zealand. Black African recruits contributed increasingly to the British war effort. International public opinion was sympathetic to the Boers and hostile to the British. Even within the UK, there existed significant opposition to the war. As a result, the Boer cause attracted thousands of volunteers from neutral countries, including the German Empire, United States, Russia and even some parts of the British Empire such as Australia and Ireland. Some consider the war the beginning of questioning the British Empire&#x27;s veneer of impenetrable global dominance, due to the war&#x27;s surprising duration and the unforeseen losses suffered by the British. A trial for British war crimes committed during the war, including the killings of civilians and prisoners, was opened in January 1901.

== Overview ==

The war had three phases. In the first phase, the Boers mounted preemptive strikes into British-held territory in Natal and the Cape Colony, besieging the British garrisons of Ladysmith, Mafeking, and Kimberley. The Boers then won a series of tactical victories at Stormberg, Magersfontein, Colenso and Spion Kop.

In the second phase, after the number of British troops greatly increased under the command of Lord Roberts, the British launched another offensive in 1900 to relieve the sieges, this time achieving success. After Natal and the Cape Colony were secure, the British army was able to invade the Transvaal, and the republic&#x27;s capital, Pretoria, was ultimately captured in June 1900.

In the third and final phase, beginning in March 1900 and lasting a further two years, the Boers conducted a hard-fought guerrilla war, attacking British troop columns, telegraph sites, railways, and storage depots. To deny supplies to the Boer guerrillas, the British, now under the leadership of Lord Kitchener, adopted a scorched earth policy. They cleared vast areas, destroying Boer farms and moving the civilians into concentration camps.

Some parts of the British press and British government expected the campaign to be over within months, and the protracted war gradually became less popular, especially after revelations about the conditions in the concentration camps (where as many as 26,000 Afrikaner women and children died of disease and malnutrition). The Boer forces finally surrendered on Saturday, 31 May 1902, with 54 of the 60 delegates from the Transvaal and Orange Free State voting to accept the terms of the peace treaty. This was known as the Treaty of Vereeniging, and under its provisions, the two republics were absorbed into the British Empire, with the promise of self-government in the future. This promise was fulfilled with the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910.

The war had a lasting effect on the region and on British domestic politics. For Britain, the Second Boer War was the longest, the most expensive (£211 million, £19.9 billion at 2022 prices), and the bloodiest conflict between 1815 and 1914, lasting three months longer and resulting in more British combat casualties than the Crimean War (1853–1856). Disease took a greater toll in the Crimean War, claiming 17,580 British.

=== Name ===

The conflict is commonly referred to simply as &quot;the Boer War&quot; because the First Boer War (December 1880 to March 1881) was a much smaller conflict. &quot;Boer&quot; (meaning &quot;farmer&quot;) is the common name for Afrikaans-speaking white South Africans descended from the Dutch East India Company&#x27;s original settlers at the Cape of Good Hope. Among some South Africans, it is known as the (Second) Anglo–Boer War. In Afrikaans, it may be called (in order of frequency) the &#x27; (&quot;Second Freedom War&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;Second Boer War&quot;), (&quot;Anglo–Boer War&quot;) or (&quot;English War&quot;).

In South Africa, it is officially called the South African War. In fact, according to a 2011 BBC report, &quot;most scholars prefer to call the war of 1899–1902 the South African War, thereby acknowledging that all South Africans, white and black, were affected by the war and that many were participants&quot;.

=== Origins ===

The origins of the war were complex and stemmed from more than a century of conflict between the Boers and Britain. Of immediate importance, however, was the question of who would control and benefit most from the very lucrative Witwatersrand gold mines discovered by Jan Gerrit Bantjes in June 1884.

The first European settlement in South Africa was founded at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, and thereafter administered as part of the Dutch Cape Colony. The Cape was governed by the Dutch East India Company, until its bankruptcy in the late 18th century, and was thereafter governed directly by the Netherlands. As a result of political turmoil in the Netherlands, the British occupied the Cape three times during the Napoleonic Wars, and the occupation became permanent after British forces defeated the Dutch at the Battle of Blaauwberg in 1806. At the time, the colony was home to about 26,000 colonists settled under Dutch rule. A relative majority represented old Dutch families brought to the Cape during the late 17th and early 18th centuries; however, close to one-fourth of this demographic was of German origin and one-sixth of French Huguenot descent. Cleavages were likelier to occur along socio-economic rather than ethnic lines. Broadly speaking, the colonists included a number of distinct subgroups, including the Boers. The Boers were itinerant farmers who lived on the colony&#x27;s frontiers, seeking better pastures for their livestock. Many were dissatisfied with aspects of British administration, in particular with Britain&#x27;s abolition of slavery on 1 December 1834. Boers who used forced labor would have been unable to collect compensation for their slaves. Between 1836 and 1852, many elected to migrate away from British rule in what became known as the Great Trek.

Around 15,000 trekking Boers departed the Cape Colony and followed the eastern coast towards Natal. After Britain annexed Natal in 1843, they journeyed farther northwards into South Africa&#x27;s vast eastern interior. There, they established two independent Boer republics: the South African Republic (1852; also known as the Transvaal Republic) and the Orange Free State (1854). Britain recognised the two Boer republics in 1852 and 1854 but attempted British annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 led to the First Boer War in 1880–1881. After Britain suffered defeats, particularly at the Battle of Majuba Hill (1881), the independence of the two republics was restored, subject to certain conditions. However, relations remained uneasy.

In 1866, diamonds were discovered at Kimberley, prompting a diamond rush and a massive influx of foreigners to the borders of the Orange Free State. Then, in June 1884, gold was discovered in the Witwatersrand area of the South African Republic by Jan Gerrit Bantjes. Gold made the Transvaal the richest nation in southern Africa; however, the country had neither the manpower nor the industrial base to develop the resource on its own. As a result, the Transvaal reluctantly acquiesced to the immigration of &quot;uitlanders&quot; (foreigners), mainly English-speaking men from Britain, who came to the Boer region in search of fortune and employment. As a result, the number of in the Transvaal threatened to exceed the number of Boers, precipitating confrontations between the Boer settlers and the newer, non-Boer arrivals.

Britain&#x27;s expansionist ideas (notably propagated by Cecil Rhodes) as well as disputes over uitlander political and economic rights led to the failed Jameson Raid of 1895. Dr. Leander Starr Jameson, who led the raid, intended to encourage an uprising of the uitlanders in Johannesburg. However, the uitlanders did not take up arms in support, and Transvaal government forces surrounded the column and captured Jameson&#x27;s men before they could reach Johannesburg.

As tensions escalated, political manoeuvrings and negotiations attempted to reach compromise on the issues of uitlanders&#x27; rights within the South African Republic, control of the gold mining industry, and Britain&#x27;s desire to incorporate the Transvaal and the Orange Free State into a federation under British control. Given the British origins of the majority of uitlanders and the ongoing influx of new uitlanders into Johannesburg, the Boers recognised that granting full voting rights to the uitlanders would eventually result in the loss of ethnic Boer control in the South African Republic.

The June 1899 negotiations in Bloemfontein failed, and in September 1899 British Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain demanded full voting rights and representation for the uitlanders residing in the Transvaal. Paul Kruger, the President of the South African Republic, issued an ultimatum on 9 October 1899, giving the British government 48 hours to withdraw all their troops from the borders of both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, failing which the Transvaal, allied to the Orange Free State, would declare war on the British government. (In fact, Kruger had ordered commandos to the Natal border in early September, and Britain had only troops in garrison towns far from the border.) The British government rejected the South African Republic&#x27;s ultimatum, and the South African Republic and Orange Free State declared war on Britain.

== Historical background ==
The southern part of the African continent was dominated in the 19th century by a set of struggles to create within it a single unified state. In 1868, Britain annexed Basutoland in the Drakensberg Mountains, following an appeal from Moshoeshoe I, the king of the Sotho people, who sought British protection against the Boers. While the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 sought to draw boundaries between the European powers&#x27; African possessions, it also set the stage for further scrambles. Britain attempted to annex first the South African Republic in 1880, and then, in 1899, both the South African Republic and the Orange Free State.

In the 1880s, Bechuanaland (modern Botswana) became the object of a dispute between the Germans to the west, the Boers to the east, and Britain&#x27;s Cape Colony to the south. Although Bechuanaland had no economic value, the &quot;Missionaries Road&quot; passed through it towards territory farther north. After the Germans annexed Damaraland and Namaqualand (modern Namibia) in 1884, Britain annexed Bechuanaland in 1885.

In the First Boer War of 1880–1881 the Boers of the Transvaal Republic proved skilful fighters in resisting Britain&#x27;s attempt at annexation, causing a series of British defeats. The British government of William Ewart Gladstone was unwilling to become mired in a distant war, requiring substantial troop reinforcement and expense, for what was perceived at the time to be a minimal return. An armistice ended the war, and subsequently a peace treaty was signed with the Transvaal President Paul Kruger.

In June 1884, British imperial interests were ignited in the discovery by Jan Gerrit Bantjes of what would prove to be the world&#x27;s largest deposit of gold-bearing ore at an outcrop on a large ridge some south of the Boer capital at Pretoria. The ridge was known locally as the &quot;Witwatersrand&quot; (white water ridge, a watershed). A gold rush to the Transvaal brought thousands of British and other prospectors and settlers from around the globe and over the border from the Cape Colony, which had been under British control since 1806.

The city of Johannesburg sprang up nearly overnight as a shanty town. &quot;Uitlanders&quot; (foreigners, white outsiders) poured in and settled around the mines. The influx was so rapid that uitlanders quickly outnumbered the Boers in Johannesburg and along the Rand, although they remained a minority in the Transvaal. The Boers, nervous and resentful of the uitlanders&#x27; growing presence, sought to contain their influence through requiring lengthy residential qualifying periods before voting rights could be obtained; by imposing taxes on the gold industry; and by introducing controls through licensing, tariffs and administrative requirements. Among the issues giving rise to tension between the Transvaal government on the one hand and the uitlanders and British interests on the other, were:
* Established uitlanders, including the mining magnates, wanted political, social, and economic control over their lives. These rights included a stable constitution, a fair franchise law, an independent judiciary and a better educational system. The Boers, for their part, recognised that the more concessions they made to the uitlanders the greater the likelihood—with approximately 30,000 white male Boer voters and potentially 60,000 white male uitlanders—that their independent control of the Transvaal would be lost, and the territory absorbed into the British Empire.
* The uitlanders resented the taxes levied by the Transvaal government, particularly when this money was not spent on Johannesburg or uitlander interests but diverted to projects elsewhere in the Transvaal. For example, as the gold-bearing ore sloped away from the outcrop underground to the south, more and more blasting was necessary to extract it, and mines consumed vast quantities of explosives. A box of dynamite costing five pounds included five shillings tax. Not only was this tax perceived as exorbitant, but British interests were offended when President Paul Kruger gave monopoly rights for the manufacture of the explosive to a non-British branch of the Nobel company, which infuriated Britain. The so-called &quot;dynamite monopoly&quot; became a casus belli.

British imperial interests were alarmed when in 1894–1895 Kruger proposed building a railway through Portuguese East Africa to Delagoa Bay, bypassing British-controlled ports in Natal and Cape Town and avoiding British tariffs. At the time, the Prime Minister of the Cape Colony was Cecil Rhodes, a man driven by a vision of a British-controlled Africa extending from the Cape to Cairo. Certain self-appointed &quot;uitlanders&quot;&#x27; representatives and British mine owners became increasingly frustrated and angered by their dealings with the Transvaal government. A Reform Committee (Transvaal) was formed to represent the uitlanders.

=== Jameson Raid ===


In 1895, a plan to take Johannesburg and end the control of the Transvaal government was hatched with the connivance of the Cape Prime Minister Rhodes and Johannesburg gold magnate Alfred Beit. A column of 600 armed men was led over the border from Bechuanaland towards Johannesburg by Jameson, the Administrator in Rhodesia of the British South Africa Company, of which Cecil Rhodes was the chairman. The column, mainly made up of Rhodesian and Bechuanaland British South Africa Policemen, was equipped with Maxim machine guns and some artillery pieces.

The plan was to make a three-day dash to Johannesburg and trigger an uprising by the primarily British expatriate uitlanders, organised by the Johannesburg Reform Committee, before the Boer commandos could mobilise. However, the Transvaal authorities had advance warning of the Jameson Raid and tracked it from the moment it crossed the border. Four days later, the weary and dispirited column was surrounded near Krugersdorp, within sight of Johannesburg. After a brief skirmish in which the column lost 65 killed and wounded—while the Boers lost but one man—Jameson&#x27;s men surrendered and were arrested by the Boers.

The botched raid had repercussions throughout southern Africa and in Europe. In Rhodesia, the departure of so many policemen enabled the Matabele and Mashona peoples&#x27; rising against the British South Africa Company. The rebellion, known as the Second Matabele War, was suppressed only at a great cost.

A few days after the raid, the German Kaiser sent a telegram—known to history as &quot;the Kruger telegram&quot;—congratulating President Kruger and the government of the South African Republic on their success. When the text of this telegram was disclosed in the British press, it generated a storm of anti-German feeling. In the baggage of the raiding column, to the great embarrassment of Britain, the Boers found telegrams from Cecil Rhodes and the other plotters in Johannesburg. Chamberlain had approved Rhodes&#x27; plans to send armed assistance in the case of a Johannesburg uprising, but he quickly moved to condemn the raid. Rhodes was severely censured at the Cape inquiry and the London parliamentary inquiry and was forced to resign as Prime Minister of the Cape and as Chairman of the British South Africa Company, for having sponsored the failed &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

The Boer government handed their prisoners over to the British for trial. Jameson was tried in England, where the British press and London society, inflamed by anti-Boer and anti-German feeling and in a frenzy of jingoism, lionised him and treated him as a hero. Although sentenced to 15 months imprisonment (which he served in Holloway), Jameson was later rewarded by being named Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (1904–1908) and was ultimately anointed as one of the founders of the Union of South Africa. For conspiring with Jameson, the uitlander members of the Reform Committee (Transvaal) were tried in the Transvaal courts and found guilty of high treason. The four leaders were sentenced to death by hanging, but the next day this sentence was commuted to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment. In June 1896, the other members of the committee were released on payment of £2,000 each in fines, all of which were paid by Cecil Rhodes. One Reform Committee member, Frederick Gray, committed suicide while in Pretoria gaol, on 16 May. His death was a factor in softening the Transvaal government&#x27;s attitude to the surviving prisoners.

Jan C. Smuts wrote, in 1906:

=== Escalation ===

The Jameson Raid alienated many Cape Afrikaners from Britain and united the Transvaal Boers behind President Kruger and his government. It also had the effect of drawing the Transvaal and the Orange Free State (led by President Martinus Theunis Steyn) together in opposition to British imperialism. In 1897, the two republics concluded a military pact.

=== Arming the Boers ===
In earlier conflicts, the Boers&#x27; most common weapon was the British Westley Richards falling-block breech-loader. In his book &quot;The First Boer War&quot;, Joseph Lehmann offers this comment: &quot;Employing chiefly the very fine breech-loading Westley Richards – calibre 45; paper cartridge; percussion-cap replaced on the nipple manually—they made it exceedingly dangerous for the British to expose themselves on the skyline&quot;.

Kruger re-equipped the Transvaal army, importing 37,000 of the latest 7x57 mm Mauser Model 1895 rifles supplied by Germany, and some 40 to 50 million rounds of ammunition. Some commandos used the Martini-Henry Mark III, because thousands of these had been purchased. Unfortunately, the large puff of white smoke after firing gave away the shooter&#x27;s position. Roughly 7,000 Guedes 1885 rifles had also been purchased a few years earlier, and these were also used during the hostilities.

As the war went on, some commandos relied on captured British rifles, such as the Lee-Metford and the Enfield. Indeed, when the ammunition for the Mausers ran out, the Boers relied primarily on the captured Lee-Metfords.

Regardless of the rifle, few of the Boers used bayonets.

The Boers also purchased the best modern European German Krupp artillery. By October 1899, the Transvaal State Artillery had 73 heavy guns, including four 155 mm Creusot fortress guns and 25 of the 37 mm Maxim Nordenfeldt guns.
The Boers&#x27; Maxim, larger than the British Maxims, was a large calibre, belt-fed, water-cooled &quot;auto cannon&quot; that fired explosive rounds (smokeless ammunition) at 450 rounds per minute. It became known as the &quot;Pom Pom&quot;.

Aside from weaponry, the tactics used by the Boers were significant. As one modern source states, &quot;Boer soldiers ... were adept at guerrilla warfare—something the British had difficulty countering&quot;.

The Transvaal army was transformed: Approximately 25,000 men equipped with modern rifles and artillery could mobilise within two weeks. However, President Kruger&#x27;s victory in the Jameson Raid incident did nothing to resolve the fundamental problem of finding a formula to conciliate the uitlanders, without surrendering the independence of the Transvaal.

=== British case for war ===

The failure to gain improved rights for uitlanders (notably the goldfields dynamite tax) became a pretext for war and a justification for a big military build-up in Cape Colony. The case for war was developed and espoused as far away as the Australian colonies. Cape Colony Governor Sir Alfred Milner; Rhodes; Chamberlain; and mining syndicate owners such as Beit, Barney Barnato, and Lionel Phillips, favoured annexation of the Boer republics. Confident that the Boers would be quickly defeated, they planned and organised a short war, citing the uitlanders&#x27; grievances as the motivation for the conflict. In contrast, the influence of the war party within the British government was limited. UK Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, despised jingoism and jingoists. He was also uncertain of the abilities of the British Army. Despite both his moral and practical reservations, Salisbury led the United Kingdom to war in order to preserve the British Empire&#x27;s prestige and feeling a sense of obligation to British South Africans. Salisbury also detested the Boers treatment of native Africans, referring to the London Convention of 1884, (following Britain&#x27;s defeat in the first war), as an agreement &quot;really in the interest of slavery&quot;. Salisbury was not alone in this concern. Roger Casement, already well on the way to becoming an Irish Nationalist, was nevertheless happy to gather intelligence for the British against the Boers because of their cruelty to Africans.

The British government went against the advice of its generals (including Wolseley) and declined to send substantial reinforcements to South Africa before war broke out. Secretary of State for War Lansdowne did not believe the Boers were preparing for war and that if Britain were to send large numbers of troops to the region it would strike too aggressive a posture and possibly derail a negotiated settlement—or even encourage a Boer attack.

=== Negotiations fail ===

Steyn of the Orange Free State invited Milner and Kruger to attend a conference in Bloemfontein. The conference started on 30 May 1899, but negotiations quickly broke down, as Kruger had no intention of granting meaningful concessions, and Milner had no intention of accepting his normal delaying tactics.

=== Kruger&#x27;s ultimatum and war ===

On 9 October 1899, after convincing the Orange Free State to join him and mobilising their forces, Kruger issued an ultimatum giving Britain 48 hours to withdraw all their troops from the border of Transvaal (despite the fact that the only regular British army troops anywhere near the border of either republic were 4 companies of the Loyal North Lancs, who had been deployed to defend Kimberley.) Otherwise, the Transvaal, allied with the Orange Free State, would declare war.

News of the ultimatum reached London on the day it expired. Outrage and laughter were the main responses. The editor of the &quot;Times&quot; purportedly laughed out loud when he read it, saying &#x27;an official document is seldom amusing and useful yet this was both&#x27;. &quot;The Times&quot; denounced the ultimatum as an &#x27;extravagant farce&#x27; and &quot;The Globe&quot; denounced this &#x27;trumpery little state&#x27;. Most editorials were similar to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&#x27;s&quot;, which declared: &#x27;of course there can only be one answer to this grotesque challenge. Kruger has asked for war and war he must have!&#x27;

Such views were far from those of the British government and from those in the army. To most sensible observers, army reform had been a matter of pressing concern since the 1870s, constantly put off because the British public did not want the expense of a larger, more professional army and because a large home army was not politically welcome. Lord Salisbury, the Prime Minister, had to tell a surprised Queen Victoria that &#x27;We have no army capable of meeting even a second-class Continental Power&#x27;.

== First phase: The Boer offensive (October–December 1899) ==

=== British Army deployed ===

When war with the Boer republics was imminent in September 1899, a Field Force, referred to as the Army Corps (sometimes 1st Army Corps) was mobilised and sent to Cape Town. It was &quot;about the equivalent of the I Army Corps of the existing mobilization scheme&quot; and was placed under the command of Gen Sir Redvers Buller, general officer commanding-in-chief of Aldershot Command. In South Africa the corps never operated as such and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd divisions were widely dispersed.

=== Boer organization and skills ===

War was declared on 11 October 1899 with a Boer offensive into the British-held Natal and Cape Colony areas. The Boers had about 33,000 soldiers, and decisively outnumbered the British, who could move only 13,000 troops to the front line. The Boers had no problems with mobilisation, since the fiercely independent Boers had no regular army units, apart from the &quot;Staatsartillerie&quot; (Dutch for &#x27;State Artillery&#x27;) of both republics. As with the First Boer War, since most of the Boers were members of civilian militias, none had adopted uniforms or insignia. Only the members of the &quot;Staatsartillerie&quot; wore light green uniforms.

When danger loomed, all the &quot;burgers&quot; (citizens) in a district would form a military unit called a &quot;commando&quot; and would elect officers. A full-time official called a &quot;Veldkornet&quot; maintained muster rolls but had no disciplinary powers. Each man brought his own weapon, usually a hunting rifle, and his own horse. Those who could not afford a gun were given one by the authorities. The Presidents of the Transvaal and Orange Free State simply signed decrees to concentrate within a week, and the commandos could muster between 30,000 and 40,000 men. The average Boer nevertheless was not thirsty for war. Many did not look forward to fighting against fellow Christians and, by and large, fellow Protestants. Many may have had an overly optimistic sense of what the war would involve, imagining that victory could be achieved as fast and easily as it had been in the First Anglo-Boer War. Many, including many generals, also had a sense that their cause was holy and just, and blessed by God.

It rapidly became clear that the Boer forces presented the British forces with a severe tactical challenge. What the Boers presented was a mobile and innovative approach to warfare, drawing on their experiences from the First Boer War. The average Boers who made up their commandos were farmers who had spent almost all their working life in the saddle, both as farmers and hunters. They depended on the pot, horse and rifle; they were also skilled stalkers and marksmen. As hunters, they had learned to fire from cover; from a prone position and to make the first shot count, knowing that if they missed, the game would either be long gone or could charge and potentially kill them.

At community gatherings, target shooting was a major sport; they practised shooting at targets, such as hens&#x27; eggs perched on posts away. They made expert mounted infantry, using every scrap of cover, from which they could pour in a destructive fire using modern, smokeless, Mauser rifles. In preparation for hostilities, the Boers had acquired around one hundred of the latest Krupp field guns, all horse-drawn and dispersed among the various Kommando groups and several Le Creusot &quot;Long Tom&quot; siege guns. The Boers&#x27; skill in adapting themselves to become first-rate artillerymen shows that they were a versatile adversary. The Transvaal also had an intelligence service that stretched across South Africa and of whose extent and efficiency the British were as yet unaware.

=== Boers besiege Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley ===

The Boers struck first on 12 October at the Battle of Kraaipan, an attack that heralded the invasion of the Cape Colony and Natal between October 1899 and January 1900. With speed and surprise, the Boers drove quickly towards the British garrison at Ladysmith and the smaller ones at Mafeking and Kimberley. The quick Boer mobilisation resulted in early military successes against scattered British forces. Sir George Stuart White, commanding the British division at Ladysmith, unwisely allowed Major-General Penn Symons to throw a brigade forward to the coal-mining town of Dundee (also reported as Glencoe), which was surrounded by hills. This became the site of the first major clash of the war, the Battle of Talana Hill. Boer guns began shelling the British camp from the summit of Talana Hill at dawn on 20 October. Penn Symons immediately counter-attacked: His infantry drove the Boers from the hill, for the loss of 446 British casualties, including Penn Symons.

Another Boer force occupied Elandslaagte, which lay between Ladysmith and Dundee. The British under Major General John French and Colonel Ian Hamilton attacked to clear the line of communications to Dundee. The resulting Battle of Elandslaagte was a clear-cut British tactical victory, but Sir George White feared that more Boers were about to attack his main position and so ordered a chaotic retreat from Elandslaagte, throwing away any advantage gained. The detachment from Dundee was compelled to make an exhausting cross-country retreat to rejoin White&#x27;s main force. As Boers surrounded Ladysmith and opened fire on the town with siege guns, White ordered a major sortie against their positions. The result was a disaster, with 140 men killed and over 1,000 captured. The siege of Ladysmith began: it was to last several months.

Meanwhile, to the north-west at Mafeking, on the border with Transvaal, Colonel Robert Baden-Powell had raised two regiments of local forces amounting to about 1,200 men in order to attack and create diversions if things went amiss further south. As a railway junction, Mafeking provided good supply facilities and was the obvious place for Baden-Powell to fortify in readiness for such attacks. However, instead of being the aggressor, Baden-Powell was forced to defend Mafeking when 6,000 Boer, commanded by Piet Cronjé, attempted a determined assault on the town. This quickly subsided into a desultory affair, with the Boers prepared to starve the stronghold into submission. So, on 13 October, the 217-day siege of Mafeking began.

Lastly, over to the south of Mafeking lay the diamond mining city of Kimberley, which was also subjected to a siege. Although not militarily significant, it nonetheless represented an enclave of British imperialism on the borders of the Orange Free State and was hence an important Boer objective. In early November, about 7,500 Boer began their siege, again content to starve the town into submission. Despite Boer shelling, the 40,000 inhabitants, of which only 5,000 were armed, were under little threat, because the town was well-stocked with provisions. The garrison was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Kekewich, although Rhodes was also a prominent figure in the town&#x27;s defences.

Siege life took its toll on both the defending soldiers and the civilians in the cities of Mafeking, Ladysmith, and Kimberley as food began to grow scarce after a few weeks. In Mafeking, Sol Plaatje wrote, &quot;I saw horseflesh for the first time being treated as a human foodstuff.&quot; The cities under siege also dealt with constant artillery bombardment, making the streets a dangerous place. Near the end of the siege of Kimberley, it was expected that the Boers would intensify their bombardment, so Rhodes displayed a notice encouraging people to go down into shafts of the Kimberley Mine for protection. The townspeople panicked, and people surged into the mineshafts constantly for a 12-hour period. Although the bombardment never came, this did nothing to diminish the anxious civilians&#x27; distress. The most well-heeled of the townspeople, including Cecil Rhodes, sheltered in the Sanatorium, site of the present-day McGregor Museum; the poorer residents, notably the black population, did not have any shelter from shelling.

In retrospect, the Boers&#x27; decision to commit themselves to sieges (&quot;Sitzkrieg&quot;) was a mistake and one of the best illustrations of their lack of strategic vision. Historically, it had little in its favour. Of the seven sieges in the First Boer War, the Boers had prevailed in none. More importantly, it handed the initiative back to the British and allowed them time to recover, which they did. Generally speaking, throughout the campaign, the Boers were too defensive and passive, wasting the opportunities they had for victory. Yet that passivity also testified to the fact that they had no desire to conquer British territory, but only to preserve their ability to rule in their own territory.

=== First British relief attempts ===

On 31 October 1899, General Sir Redvers Henry Buller, a much-respected commander, arrived in South Africa with the Army Corps, made up of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd divisions. Buller originally intended an offensive straight up the railway line leading from Cape Town through Bloemfontein to Pretoria. Finding on arrival that the British troops already in South Africa were under siege, he split his army corps into detachments to relieve the besieged garrisons. One division, led by Lieutenant General Lord Methuen, was to follow the Western Railway to the north and relieve Kimberley and Mafeking. A smaller force of about 3,000, led by Major General William Gatacre, was to push north towards the railway junction at Stormberg and secure the Cape Midlands District from Boer raids and local rebellions by Boer inhabitants. Buller led the major part of the army corps to relieve Ladysmith to the east.

The initial results of this offensive were mixed, with Methuen winning several bloody skirmishes in the Battle of Belmont on 23 November, the Battle of Graspan on 25 November, and at a larger engagement, the Battle of Modder River, on 28 November resulting in British losses of 71 dead and over 400 wounded. British commanders had been trained on the lessons of the Crimean War and were adept at battalion and regimental set pieces, with columns manoeuvring in jungles, deserts and mountainous regions. What British generals failed to comprehend was the impact of destructive fire from trench positions and the mobility of cavalry raids. The British troops went to war with what would prove to be antiquated tactics—and in some cases antiquated weapons—against the mobile Boer forces with the destructive fire of their modern Mausers, the latest Krupp field guns and their novel tactics.

The middle of December was disastrous for the British Army. In a period known as Black Week (10–15 December 1899), the British suffered defeats on each of the three fronts. On 10 December, General Gatacre tried to recapture Stormberg railway junction about south of the Orange River. Gatacre&#x27;s attack was marked by administrative and tactical blunders and the Battle of Stormberg ended in a British defeat, with 135 killed and wounded and two guns and over 600 troops captured.

At the Battle of Magersfontein on 11 December, Methuen&#x27;s 14,000 British troops attempted to capture a Boer position in a dawn attack to relieve Kimberley. This too turned into a disaster when the Highland Brigade became pinned down by accurate Boer fire. After suffering from intense heat and thirst for nine hours, they eventually broke in ill-disciplined retreat. The Boer commanders, Koos de la Rey and Cronjé, had ordered trenches to be dug in an unconventional place to fool the British and to give their riflemen a greater firing range. The plan worked, and this tactic helped to write the doctrine of the supremacy of the defensive position, using modern small arms and trench fortifications. The British lost 120 killed and 690 wounded and were prevented from relieving Kimberley and Mafeking. A British soldier said of the defeat:

The nadir of Black Week was the Second Battle of Colenso on 15 December, where 21,000 British troops, commanded by Buller, attempted to cross the Tugela River to relieve Ladysmith, where 8,000 Transvaal Boers under the command of Louis Botha were waiting for them. Through a combination of artillery and accurate rifle fire and better use of the ground, the Boers repelled all British attempts to cross the river. After his first attacks failed, Buller broke off the battle and ordered a retreat, abandoning many wounded men, several isolated units and ten field guns to be captured by Botha&#x27;s men. Buller&#x27;s forces lost 145 men killed and 1,200 missing or wounded and the Boers suffered only 40 casualties, including 8 killed.

== Second phase: The British offensive of January to September 1900 ==

The British government took these defeats badly and with the sieges still continuing was compelled to send two more divisions plus large numbers of colonial volunteers. By January 1900 this would become the largest force Britain had ever sent overseas, amounting to some 180,000 men with further reinforcements being sought.

While watching for these reinforcements, Buller made another bid to relieve Ladysmith by crossing the Tugela west of Colenso. Buller&#x27;s subordinate, Major General Charles Warren, successfully crossed the river, but was then faced with a fresh defensive position centred on a prominent hill known as Spion Kop. In the resulting Battle of Spion Kop, British troops captured the summit by surprise during the early hours of 24 January 1900, but as the early morning fog lifted, they realised too late that they were overlooked by Boer gun emplacements on the surrounding hills. The rest of the day resulted in a disaster caused by poor communication between Buller and his commanders. Between them they issued contradictory orders, on the one hand ordering men off the hill, while other officers ordered fresh reinforcements to defend it. The result was 350 men killed and nearly 1,000 wounded and a retreat across the Tugela River into British territory. There were nearly 300 Boer casualties.

Buller attacked Louis Botha again on 5 February at Vaal Krantz and was again defeated. Buller withdrew early when it appeared that the British would be isolated in an exposed bridgehead across the Tugela, for which he was nicknamed &quot;Sir Reverse&quot; by some of his officers.

=== Buller replaced ===
By taking command in person in Natal, Buller had allowed the overall direction of the war to drift. Because of concerns about his performance and negative reports from the field, he was replaced as Commander in Chief by Roberts. Roberts quickly assembled an entirely new team for headquarters staff and he chose military men from far and wide: Kitchener (Chief of Staff) from the Sudan; Frederick Russell Burnham (Chief of Scouts), the American scout, from the Klondike; George Henderson from the Staff College; Neville Bowles Chamberlain from Afghanistan; and William Nicholson (Military Secretary) from Calcutta. Like Buller, Roberts first intended to attack directly along the Cape Town–Pretoria railway but, again like Buller, was forced to relieve the beleaguered garrisons. Leaving Buller in command in Natal, Roberts massed his main force near the Orange River and along the Western Railway behind Methuen&#x27;s force at the Modder River and prepared to make a wide outflanking move to relieve Kimberley.

Except in Natal, the war had stagnated. Other than a single attempt to storm Ladysmith, the Boers made no attempt to capture the besieged towns. In the Cape Midlands, the Boers did not exploit the British defeat at Stormberg and were prevented from capturing the railway junction at Colesberg. In the dry summer, the grazing on the veld became parched, weakening the Boers&#x27; horses and draught oxen, and many Boer families joined their menfolk in the siege lines and &quot;laagers&quot; (encampments), fatally encumbering Cronjé&#x27;s army.

=== Roberts relieves the sieges ===

Roberts launched his main attack on 10 February 1900 and although hampered by a long supply route, managed to outflank the Boers defending Magersfontein. On 14 February, a cavalry division under French launched a major attack to relieve Kimberley. Although encountering severe fire, a massed cavalry charge split the Boer defences on 15 February, opening the way for French to enter Kimberley that evening, ending its 124 days&#x27; siege.

Meanwhile, Roberts pursued Piet Cronjé&#x27;s 7,000-strong force, which had abandoned Magersfontein to head for Bloemfontein. General French&#x27;s cavalry was ordered to assist in the pursuit by embarking on an epic drive towards Paardeberg where Cronjé was attempting to cross the Modder River. At the Battle of Paardeberg from 18 to 27 February, Roberts then surrounded Cronjé&#x27;s retreating Boer army. On 17 February, a pincer movement involving both French&#x27;s cavalry and the main British force attempted to take the entrenched position, but the frontal attacks were uncoordinated and so were repulsed by the Boers. Finally, Roberts resorted to bombarding Cronjé into submission. It took ten days, and when the British troops used the polluted Modder River as water supply, typhoid killed many troops. General Cronjé was finally forced to surrender at the Battle of Paardeberg with 4,000 men.
In Natal, the Battle of the Tugela Heights, which started on 14 February was Buller&#x27;s fourth attempt to relieve Ladysmith. The losses Buller&#x27;s troops had sustained convinced Buller to adopt Boer tactics &quot;in the firing line—to advance in small rushes, covered by rifle fire from behind; to use the tactical support of artillery; and above all, to use the ground, making rock and earth work for them as it did for the enemy.&quot; Despite reinforcements his progress was painfully slow against stiff opposition. However, on 26 February, after much deliberation, Buller used all his forces in one all-out attack for the first time and at last succeeded in forcing a crossing of the Tugela to defeat Botha&#x27;s outnumbered forces north of Colenso. After a siege lasting 118 days, the Relief of Ladysmith was effected, the day after Cronjé surrendered, but at a total cost of 7,000 British casualties. Buller&#x27;s troops marched into Ladysmith on 28 February.

After a succession of defeats, the Boers realised that against such overwhelming numbers of troops, they had little chance of defeating the British and so became demoralised. Roberts then advanced into the Orange Free State from the west, putting the Boers to flight at the Battle of Poplar Grove and capturing Bloemfontein, the capital, unopposed on 13 March with the Boer defenders escaping and scattering. Meanwhile, he detached a small force to relieve Baden-Powell. The Relief of Mafeking on 18 May 1900 provoked riotous celebrations in Britain, the origin of the Edwardian slang word &quot;mafficking&quot;. On 28 May, the Orange Free State was annexed and renamed the Orange River Colony.

=== Capture of Pretoria ===

After being forced to delay for several weeks at Bloemfontein by a shortage of supplies, an outbreak of typhoid at Paardeberg, and poor medical care, Roberts finally resumed his advance. He was forced to halt again at Kroonstad for 10 days, due once again to the collapse of his medical and supply systems, but finally captured Johannesburg on 31 May and the capital of the Transvaal, Pretoria, on 5 June. The first into Pretoria was Lt. William Watson of the New South Wales Mounted Rifles, who persuaded the Boers to surrender the capital. Before the war, the Boers had constructed several forts south of Pretoria, but the artillery had been removed from the forts for use in the field, and in the event they abandoned Pretoria without a fight. Having won the principal cities, Roberts declared the war over on 3 September 1900; and the South African Republic was formally annexed.

British observers believed the war to be all but over after the capture of the two capital cities. However, the Boers had earlier met at the temporary new capital of the Orange Free State, Kroonstad, and planned a guerrilla campaign to hit the British supply and communication lines. The first engagement of this new form of warfare was at Sanna&#x27;s Post on 31 March where 1,500 Boers under the command of Christiaan de Wet attacked Bloemfontein&#x27;s waterworks about east of the city, and ambushed a heavily escorted convoy, which caused 155 British casualties and the capture of seven guns, 117 wagons, and 428 British troops.

After the fall of Pretoria, one of the last formal battles was at Diamond Hill on 11–12 June, where Roberts attempted to drive the remnants of the Boer field army under Botha beyond striking distance of Pretoria. Although Roberts drove the Boers from the hill, Botha did not regard it as a defeat, for he inflicted 162 casualties on the British while suffering only around 50 casualties.

=== Boers retreat ===

The set-piece period of the war now largely gave way to a mobile guerrilla war, but one final operation remained. President Kruger and what remained of the Transvaal government had retreated to eastern Transvaal. Roberts, joined by troops from Natal under Buller, advanced against them, and broke their last defensive position at Bergendal on 26 August. As Roberts and Buller followed up along the railway line to Komatipoort, Kruger sought asylum in Portuguese East Africa (modern Mozambique). Some dispirited Boers did likewise, and the British gathered up much war material. However, the core of the Boer fighters under Botha easily broke back through the Drakensberg Mountains into the Transvaal highveld after riding north through the bushveld.

As Roberts&#x27;s army occupied Pretoria, the Boer fighters in the Orange Free State retreated into the Brandwater Basin, a fertile area in the south-east of the Republic. This offered only temporary sanctuary, as the mountain passes leading to it could be occupied by the British, trapping the Boers. A force under General Archibald Hunter set out from Bloemfontein to achieve this in July 1900. The hard core of the Free State Boers under De Wet, accompanied by President Steyn, left the basin early. Those remaining fell into confusion and most failed to break out before Hunter trapped them. 4,500 Boers surrendered and much equipment was captured but as with Roberts&#x27;s drive against Kruger at the same time, these losses were of relatively little consequence, as the hard core of the Boer armies and their most determined and active leaders remained at large.

From the Basin, Christiaan de Wet headed west. Although hounded by British columns, he succeeded in crossing the Vaal into western Transvaal, to allow Steyn to travel to meet their leaders. There was much sympathy for the Boers on mainland Europe. In October, President Kruger and members of the Transvaal government left Portuguese East Africa on the Dutch warship &quot;De Gelderland&quot;, sent by the Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. Paul Kruger&#x27;s wife, however, was too ill to travel and remained in South Africa where she died on 20 July 1901 without seeing her husband again. President Kruger first went to Marseille and then on to the Netherlands, where he stayed for a while before moving finally to Clarens, Switzerland, where he died in exile on 14 July 1904.

=== Prisoners of war sent overseas ===
The first sizeable batch of Boer prisoners of war taken by the British consisted of those captured at the Battle of Elandslaagte on 21 October 1899. Initially, these POWs were held on troopships in Simons Bay until POW camps in Cape Town and Simonstown were completed. In total, six prisoner of war camps would be set up in South Africa during the war. As numbers grew, the British decided they did not want them kept locally. The capture of 4000 POWs in February 1900 was a key event, which made the British realise they could not accommodate all POWs in South Africa. The British feared they could be freed by sympathetic locals. Moreover, they already had trouble supplying their own troops in South Africa and did not want the added burden of sending supplies for the POWs. Britain therefore chose to send many POWs overseas.

Around 31 prisoner of war camps were consequently set up in British colonies overseas during the war. The first overseas (off African mainland) camps were opened in Saint Helena, which ultimately received about 5,000 POWs. About 5,000 POWs were sent to Ceylon. Other POWs were sent to Bermuda and India.

In all, nearly 26,000 POWs were sent overseas.

=== Oath of neutrality ===

On 15 March 1900, Lord Roberts proclaimed an amnesty for all burghers, except leaders, who took an oath of neutrality and returned quietly to their homes. It is estimated that between 12,000 and 14,000 burghers took this oath between March and June 1900.

== Third phase: Guerrilla war (September 1900 – May 1902) ==

By September 1900, the British were nominally in control of both Republics, with the exception of the northern part of the Transvaal. However, they soon discovered that they only controlled the territory their columns physically occupied. Despite the loss of their two capital cities and half of their army, the Boer commanders adopted guerrilla warfare tactics, primarily conducting raids against railways, resource and supply targets, all aimed at disrupting the operational capacity of the British Army. They avoided pitched battles and casualties were light.

Each Boer commando unit was sent to the district from which its members had been recruited, which meant that they could rely on local support and personal knowledge of the terrain and the towns within the district thereby enabling them to live off the land. Their orders were simply to act against the British whenever possible. Their tactics were to strike fast and hard causing as much damage to the enemy as possible, and then to withdraw and vanish before enemy reinforcements could arrive. The vast distances of the republics allowed the Boer commandos considerable freedom to move about and made it nearly impossible for the 250,000 British troops to control the territory effectively using columns alone. As soon as a British column left a town or district, British control of that area faded away. The Boer commandos were especially effective during the initial guerrilla phase of the war because Roberts had assumed that the war would end with the capture of the Boer capitals and the dispersal of the main Boer armies. Many British troops were therefore redeployed out of the area, and had been replaced by lower-quality contingents of Imperial Yeomanry and locally raised irregular corps.
From late May 1900, the first successes of the Boer guerrilla strategy were at Lindley (where 500 Yeomanry surrendered), and at Heilbron (where a large convoy and its escort were captured) and other skirmishes resulting in 1,500 British casualties in less than ten days. In December 1900, De la Rey and Christiaan Beyers attacked and mauled a British brigade at Nooitgedacht, inflicting over 650 casualties. As a result of these and other Boer successes, the British, led by Lord Kitchener, mounted three extensive searches for Christiaan de Wet, but without success. However, the Boer raids on British army camps and other targets were sporadic and poorly planned, and the very nature of the Boer guerrilla war itself had practically no overall long-term objectives, with the exception to simply harass the British. This led to a disorganised pattern of scattered engagements between the British and the Boers throughout the region.

===Use of blockhouses===
The British were forced to quickly revise their tactics. They concentrated on restricting the freedom of movement of the Boer commandos and depriving them of local support. The railway lines had provided vital lines of communication and supply, and as the British had advanced across South Africa, they had used armoured trains and had established fortified blockhouses at key points. They now built additional blockhouses (each housing between six and eight soldiers) and fortified these to protect supply routes against Boer raiders. Eventually some 8,000 such blockhouses were built across the two South African republics, radiating from the larger towns along principal routes. Each blockhouse cost between £800 and £1,000 and took about three months to build. Despite the expense, they proved very effective; not one bridge at which a blockhouse was sited and manned was blown up.

The blockhouse system required an enormous number of troops to garrison. Well over 50,000 British troops, or 50 battalions, were involved in blockhouse duty, greater than the approximately 30,000 Boers in the field during the guerrilla phase. In addition, up to 16,000 Africans were used both as armed guards and to patrol the line at night. The Army linked the blockhouses with barbed wire fences to parcel up the wide veld into smaller areas. &quot;New Model&quot; drives were mounted under which a continuous line of troops could sweep an area of veld bounded by blockhouse lines, unlike the earlier inefficient scouring of the countryside by scattered columns.

=== Scorched earth campaign against civilians ===
The British also implemented a scorched earth policy under which they targeted everything within the controlled areas that could give sustenance to the Boer guerrillas with a view to making it harder for the Boers to survive. As British troops swept the countryside, they systematically destroyed crops, burned homesteads and farms and interned Boer and African men, women, children and workers in concentration camps. Finally, the British also established their own mounted raiding columns in support of the sweeper columns. These were used to rapidly follow and relentlessly harass the Boers with a view to delaying them and cutting off escape, while the sweeper units caught up. Many of the 90 or so mobile columns formed by the British to participate in such drives were a mixture of British and colonial troops, but they also had a large minority of armed Africans. The total number of armed Africans serving with these columns has been estimated at 20,000.

The British Army also made use of Boer auxiliaries who had been persuaded to change sides and enlist as &quot;National Scouts&quot;. Serving under the command of General Andries Cronjé (1849–1923), the National Scouts were despised as &quot;joiners&quot; but came to number a fifth of the fighting Afrikaners by the end of the War.

The British utilised armoured trains throughout the war to deliver rapid reaction forces much more quickly to incidents (such as Boer attacks on blockhouses and columns) or to drop them off ahead of retreating Boer columns.

=== Peace committees ===

Among those Burghers who had stopped fighting, it was decided to form peace committees to persuade those who were still fighting to desist. In December 1900, Lord Kitchener gave permission that a central Burgher Peace Committee be inaugurated in Pretoria. By the end of 1900 some thirty envoys were sent out to the various districts to form local peace committees to persuade burghers to give up the fight. Previous leaders of the Boers, like Generals Piet de Wet and Andries Cronjé were involved in the organisation. Meyer de Kock was the only emissary of a peace committee to be convicted of high treason and executed by firing squad.

=== Joiners ===

Some burghers joined the British in their fight against the Boers. By the end of hostilities in May 1902, there were no fewer than 5,464 burghers working for the British.

=== Orange Free State ===
After having conferred with the Transvaal leaders, de Wet returned to the Orange Free State, where he inspired a series of successful attacks and raids in the western part of the country, though he suffered a rare defeat at Bothaville in November 1900. Many Boers who had earlier returned to their farms and towns, sometimes after being given formal parole by the British, took up arms again. In late January 1901, De Wet led a renewed invasion of Cape Colony. This was less successful, because there was no general uprising among the Cape Boers, and De Wet&#x27;s men were hampered by bad weather and relentlessly pursued by British forces. They narrowly escaped across the Orange River.

From then until the final days of the war, De Wet remained comparatively quiet, rarely attacking British army camps and columns partly because the Orange Free State was effectively left desolate by British sweeps. In late 1901, De Wet overran an isolated British detachment at Groenkop, inflicting heavy casualties. This prompted Kitchener to launch the first of the &quot;New Model&quot; drives against him. De Wet escaped the first such drive but lost 300 of his fighters. This was a severe loss, and a portent of further attrition, although the subsequent attempts to round up De Wet were badly handled, and De Wet&#x27;s forces avoided capture.

=== Western Transvaal ===

The Boer commandos in the Western Transvaal were very active after September 1901. Several battles of importance were fought there between September 1901 and March 1902. At Moedwil on 30 September 1901 and again at Driefontein on 24 October, General Koos De La Rey&#x27;s forces attacked British camps and outposts but were forced to withdraw after the British offered strong resistance.

From late 1901 to early 1902, a time of relative quiet descended on the western Transvaal. February 1902 saw the next major battle in that region. On 25 February, De La Rey attacked a British column under Lieutenant-Colonel S. B. von Donop at Ysterspruit near Wolmaransstad. De La Rey succeeded in capturing many men and a large amount of ammunition. The Boer attacks prompted Lord Methuen, the British second-in-command after Kitchener, to move his column from Vryburg to Klerksdorp to deal with De La Rey. On the morning of 7 March 1902, the Boers attacked the rear guard of Methuen&#x27;s moving column at Tweebosch. Confusion reigned in British ranks and Methuen was wounded and captured by the Boers.

The Boer victories in the west led to stronger action by the British. In the second half of March 1902, large British reinforcements were sent to the Western Transvaal under the direction of Ian Hamilton. The opportunity the British were waiting for arose on 11 April 1902 at Rooiwal, where a commando led by General Jan Kemp and Commandant Potgieter attacked a superior force under Kekewich. The British soldiers were well positioned on the hillside and inflicted severe casualties on the Boers charging on horseback over a large distance, beating them back. This was the end of the war in the Western Transvaal and also the last major battle of the war.

=== Eastern Transvaal ===
Two Boer forces fought in this area, one under Botha in the south east and a second under Ben Viljoen in the north east around Lydenburg. Botha&#x27;s forces were particularly active, raiding railways and British supply convoys, and even mounting a renewed invasion of Natal in September 1901. After defeating British mounted infantry in the Battle of Blood River Poort near Dundee, Botha was forced to withdraw by heavy rains that made movement difficult and crippled his horses. Back on the Transvaal territory around his home district of Vryheid, Botha attacked a British raiding column at Bakenlaagte, using an effective mounted charge. One of the most active British units was effectively destroyed in this engagement. This made Botha&#x27;s forces the target of increasingly large scorched earth drives by British forces, in which the British made particular use of native scouts and informers. Eventually, Botha had to abandon the high veld and retreat to a narrow enclave bordering Swaziland.

To the north, Ben Viljoen grew steadily less active. His forces mounted comparatively few attacks and as a result, the Boer enclave around Lydenburg was largely unmolested. Viljoen was eventually captured.

=== Cape Colony ===

In parts of Cape Colony, particularly the Cape Midlands District where Boers formed a majority of the white inhabitants, the British had always feared a general uprising against them. In fact, no such uprising ever took place, even in the early days of the war when Boer armies had advanced across the Orange. The cautious conduct of some of the elderly Orange Free State generals had been one factor that discouraged the Cape Boers from siding with the Boer republics. Nevertheless, there was widespread pro-Boer sympathy. Some of the Cape Dutch volunteered to help the British, but a much larger number volunteered to help the other side. The political factor was more important than the military: the Cape Dutch, according to Milner 90 percent of whom favoured the rebels, controlled the provincial legislature, and its authorities forbade the British Army to burn farms or to force Boer civilians into concentration camps. The British had more limited options to suppress the insurgency in the Cape Colony as result.

After he escaped across the Orange in March 1901, de Wet had left forces under Cape rebels Kritzinger and Gideon Scheepers to maintain a guerrilla campaign in the Cape Midlands. The campaign here was one of the least chivalrous of the war, with intimidation by both sides of each other&#x27;s civilian sympathisers. In one of many skirmishes, Commandant Johannes Lötter&#x27;s small commando was tracked down by a much-superior British column and wiped out at Groenkloof. Several captured Boers, including Lotter and Scheepers, who was captured when he fell ill with appendicitis, were executed by the British for treason or for capital crimes such as the murder of British prisoners or of unarmed civilians. Some of the executions took place in public, to deter further disaffection.

Fresh Boer forces under Jan Christiaan Smuts, joined by the surviving rebels under Kritzinger, made another attack on the Cape in September 1901. They suffered severe hardships and were hard pressed by British columns, but eventually rescued themselves by routing some of their pursuers at the Battle of Elands River and capturing their equipment. From then until the end of the war, Smuts increased his forces from among Cape rebels until they numbered 3,000. However, no general uprising took place, and the situation in the Cape remained stalemated.

In January 1902, Boer leader Manie Maritz was implicated in the Leliefontein massacre in the far Northern Cape.

== Boer foreign volunteers ==

While no other government actively supported the Boer cause, individuals from several countries volunteered and formed Foreign Volunteer Units. These primarily came from Europe, particularly the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden-Norway. Other countries such as France, Italy, Ireland (then part of the United Kingdom), and restive areas of the Russian Empire, including Congress Poland and Georgia, also formed smaller volunteer corps. Finns fought in the Scandinavian Corps. Two volunteers, George Henri Anne-Marie Victor de Villebois-Mareuil of France and Yevgeny Maximov of Russia, became &quot;veggeneraals&quot; (fighting generals) of the South African Republic.

== Conclusion ==


Towards the end of the war in the early months of 1902, British tactics of containment, denial, and harassment finally began to yield results against the Boer guerrillas. The sourcing and co-ordination of intelligence became increasingly efficient with regular reporting from observers in the blockhouses, from units patrolling the fences and conducting &quot;sweeper&quot; operations, and from native Africans in rural areas who increasingly supplied intelligence, as the Scorched Earth policy took effect and they found themselves competing with the Boers for food supplies. Kitchener&#x27;s forces at last began to seriously affect the Boers&#x27; fighting strength and freedom of manoeuvre, and made it harder for the Boers and their families to survive. Despite this success, almost half the Boer fighting strength, around 15,000 men, were still in the field fighting by May 1902. However, Kitchener&#x27;s tactics were very costly: Britain was running out of time, patience, and money needed for the war.

The British offered terms of peace on various occasions, notably in March 1901, but were rejected by Botha and the &quot;Bitter-enders&quot; among the Boers. They pledged to fight until the bitter end and rejected the demand for compromise made by the &quot;Hands-uppers&quot;. Their reasons included hatred of the British, loyalty to their dead comrades, solidarity with fellow commandos, an intense desire for independence, religious arguments, and fear of captivity or punishment. On the other hand, their women and children were dying nearly every day in prison camps and independence seemed more and more impossible.

The last of the Boers finally surrendered in May 1902 and the war ended with the Treaty of Vereeniging signed on 31 May 1902. After a period of obstinacy, the British reneged and offered the Boers generous terms of conditional surrender in order to bring the war to a victorious conclusion. The Boers were given £3,000,000 for reconstruction and were promised eventual limited self-government, which was granted in 1906 and 1907. The treaty ended the existence of the Transvaal and Orange Free State as independent Boer republics and placed them within the British Empire. The Union of South Africa was established as a dominion of the British Empire in 1910.

== Nonwhite roles ==

The policy on both sides was to minimise the role of nonwhites, but the need for manpower continuously stretched those resolves. At the battle of Spion Kop in Ladysmith, Mohandas K. Gandhi with 300 free burgher Indians and 800 indentured Indian labourers started the Ambulance Corps serving the British side. As the war raged across African farms and their homes were destroyed, many became refugees and they, like the Boers, moved to the towns where the British hastily created internment camps. Subsequently, the British scorched earth policies were applied to both Boers and Africans. Although most black Africans were not considered by the British to be hostile, many tens of thousands were also forcibly removed from Boer areas and also placed in concentration camps. Africans were held separately from Boer internees. Eventually there were a total of 64 tented camps for Africans. Conditions were as bad as in the camps for the Boers, but even though, after the Fawcett Commission report, conditions improved in the Boer camps, &quot;improvements were much slower in coming to the black camps&quot;; 20,000 died there.

The Boers and the British both feared the consequences of arming Africans. The memories of the Zulu and other tribal conflicts were still fresh, and they recognised that whoever won would have to deal with the consequences of a mass militarisation of the tribes. There was therefore an unwritten agreement that this war would be a &quot;white man&#x27;s war.&quot; At the outset, British officials instructed all white magistrates in the Natal Colony to appeal to Zulu amakhosi (chiefs) to remain neutral, and President Kruger sent emissaries asking them to stay out of it. However, in some cases there were old scores to be settled, and some Africans, such as the Swazis, were eager to enter the war with the specific aim of reclaiming land won by the Boers. As the war went on there was greater involvement of Africans, and in particular large numbers became embroiled in the conflict on the British side, either voluntarily or involuntarily. By the end of the war, many Africans had been armed and had shown conspicuous gallantry in roles such as scouts, messengers, watchmen in blockhouses, and auxiliaries.

And there were more flash points outside of the war. On 6 May 1902 at Holkrantz in the southeastern Transvaal, a Zulu faction had their cattle stolen and their women and children tortured by the Boers as a punishment for assisting the British. The local Boer officer then sent an insulting message to the tribe, challenging them to take back their cattle. The Zulus attacked at night, and in a mutual bloodbath, the Boers lost 56 killed and 3 wounded, while the Africans suffered 52 killed and 48 wounded.

About 10,000 black men were attached to Boer units where they performed camp duties; a handful unofficially fought in combat. The British Army employed over 14,000 Africans as wagon drivers. Even more had combatant roles as spies, guides, and eventually as soldiers. By 1902 there were about 30,000 armed Africans in the British Army.

== Concentration camps ==


The term &quot;concentration camp&quot; was used to describe camps operated by the British in South Africa during this conflict in the years 1900–1902, and the term grew in prominence during this period.

The camps had originally been set up by the British Army as &quot;refugee camps&quot; to provide refuge for civilian families who had been forced to abandon their homes for whatever reason related to the war. However, when Kitchener took over in late 1900, he introduced new tactics in an attempt to break the guerrilla campaign and the influx of civilians grew dramatically as a result. Disease and starvation killed thousands. Kitchener initiated plans to

As Boer farms were destroyed by the British under their &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; policy—including the systematic destruction of crops and slaughtering of livestock, the burning down of homesteads and farms—to prevent the Boers from resupplying from a home base, many tens of thousands of women and children were forcibly moved into the concentration camps. This was not the first appearance of internment camps, as the Spanish had used internment in Cuba in the Ten Years&#x27; War, and the Americans in the Philippine–American War, but the Boer War concentration camp system was the first time that a whole nation had been systematically targeted, and the first in which whole regions had been depopulated.

Eventually, there were a total of 45 tented camps built for Boer internees and 64 for black Africans. Of the 28,000 Boer men captured as prisoners of war, 25,630 were sent overseas to prisoner-of-war camps throughout the British Empire. The vast majority of Boers remaining in the local camps were women and children. Around 26,370 Boer women and children were to perish in these concentration camps. Of the more than 120,000 Blacks (and Coloureds) imprisoned too, around 20,000 died.

The camps were poorly administered from the outset and became increasingly overcrowded when Kitchener&#x27;s troops implemented the internment strategy on a vast scale. Conditions were terrible for the health of the internees, mainly due to neglect, poor hygiene and bad sanitation. The supply of all items was unreliable, partly because of the constant disruption of communication lines by the Boers. The food rations were meagre and there was a two-tier allocation policy, whereby families of men who were still fighting were routinely given smaller rations than others. The inadequate shelter, poor diet, bad hygiene and overcrowding led to malnutrition and endemic contagious diseases such as measles, typhoid, and dysentery, to which the children were particularly vulnerable. Coupled with a shortage of modern medical facilities, many of the internees died. While much of the British press, including &quot;The Times&quot;, played down the problems in the camps, Emily Hobhouse helped raise public awareness in Britain of the atrocious conditions, as well as being instrumental in bringing relief to the concentration camps.

=== Cost of the war ===

It is estimated that the total cost of the war to the British government was £211,156, 000 (equivalent to £19.9bn in 2022).

== War crimes trial ==
The Boer War also saw the first war crimes prosecutions in British military history. They centered around the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC), a British Army irregular regiment of mounted rifles active in the Northern Transvaal. Originally raised in February 1901, the BVC was composed mainly of British and Commonwealth servicemen with a generous admixture of defectors from the Boer Commandos. On 4 October 1901, a letter signed by 15 members of the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC) garrison at Fort Edward was secretly dispatched to Col. F.H. Hall, the British Army Officer Commanding at Pietersburg. Written by BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, a former justice of the peace from Western Australia, the letter accused members of the Fort Edward garrison of six &quot;disgraceful incidents&quot;:

1. The shooting of six surrendered Afrikaner men and boys and the theft of their money and livestock at Valdezia on 2 July 1901. The orders had been given by Captains Alfred Taylor and James Huntley Robertson, and relayed by Sgt. Maj. K.C.B. Morrison to Sgt. D.C. Oldham. The actual killing was alleged to have been carried out by Sgt. Oldham and BVC Troopers Eden, Arnold, Brown, Heath, and Dale.

2. The shooting of BVC Trooper B.J. van Buuren by BVC Lt. Peter Handcock on 4 July 1901. Trooper van Buuren, an Afrikaner, had &quot;disapproved&quot; of the killings at Valdezia, and had informed the victims&#x27; wives and children, who were imprisoned at Fort Edward, of what had happened.

3. The revenge killing of Floris Visser, a wounded prisoner of war, near the Koedoes River on 11 August 1901. Visser had been captured by a BVC patrol led by Lieut. Harry Morant two days before his death. After Visser had been exhaustively interrogated and conveyed for 15 miles by the patrol, Lt. Morant had ordered his men to form a firing squad and shoot him. The squad consisted of BVC Troopers A.J. Petrie, J.J. Gill, Wild, and T.J. Botha. A coup de grâce was delivered by BVC Lt. Harry Picton. The slaying of Floris Visser was in retaliation for the combat death of Morant&#x27;s close friend, BVC Captain Percy Frederik Hunt, at Duivelskloof on 6 August 1901.

4. The shooting, ordered by Capt. Taylor and Lt. Morant, of four surrendered Afrikaners and four Dutch schoolteachers, who had been captured at the Elim Hospital in Valdezia, on the morning of 23 August 1901. The firing squad consisted of BVC Lt. George Witton, Sgt. D.C. Oldham, and Troopers J.T. Arnold, Edward Brown, T. Dale, and A. Heath. Although Trooper Cochrane&#x27;s letter made no mention of the fact, three Native South African witnesses were also shot dead.

The ambush and fatal shooting of the Reverend Carl August Daniel Heese of the Berlin Missionary Society near Bandolierkop on the afternoon of 23 August 1901. Rev. Heese had spiritually counseled the Dutch and Afrikaner victims that morning and had angrily protested to Lt. Morant at Fort Edward upon learning of their deaths. Trooper Cochrane alleged that the killer of Rev. Heese was BVC Lt. Peter Handcock. Although Cochrane made no mention of the fact, Rev. Heese&#x27;s driver, a member of the Southern Ndebele people, was also killed.

5. The orders, given by BVC Lt. Charles H.G. Hannam, to open fire on a wagon train containing Afrikaner women and children who were coming in to surrender at Fort Edward, on 5 September 1901. The ensuing gunfire led to the deaths of two boys, aged 5- and 13-years, and the wounding of a 9-year-old girl.

6. The shooting of Roelf van Staden and his sons Roelf and Christiaan, near Fort Edward on 7 September 1901. All were coming in to surrender in the hope of gaining medical treatment for teenaged Christiaan, who was suffering from recurring bouts of fever. Instead, they were met at the Sweetwaters Farm near Fort Edward by a party consisting of Lts. Morant and Handcock, joined by BVC Sgt. Maj. Hammet, Corp. MacMahon, and Troopers Hodds, Botha, and Thompson. Roelf van Staden and both his sons were then shot, allegedly after being forced to dig their own graves.

The letter then accused the Field Commander of the BVC, Major Robert William Lenehan, of being &quot;privy to these misdeamenours. It is for this reason that we have taken the liberty of addressing this communication direct to you.&quot; After listing numerous civilian witnesses who could confirm their allegations, Trooper Cochrane concluded, &quot;Sir, many of us are Australians who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are Africaners who have fought from Colenso till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to re-enlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek.&quot; In response to the letter written by Trooper Cochrane, Col. Hall summoned all Fort Edward officers and non-commissioned officers to Pietersburg on 21 October 1901. All were met by a party of mounted infantry five miles outside Pietersburg on the morning of 23 October 1901 and &quot;brought into town like criminals&quot;. Lt. Morant was arrested after returning from leave in Pretoria, where he had gone to settle the affairs of his deceased friend Captain Hunt.
Although the trial transcripts, like almost all others dating from between 1850 and 1914, were later destroyed by the Civil Service, it is known that a Court of Inquiry, the British military&#x27;s equivalent to a grand jury, was convened on 16 October 1901. The President of the Court was Col. H.M. Carter, who was assisted by Captain E. Evans and Major Wilfred N. Bolton, the Provost Marshal of Pietersburg. The first session of the Court took place on 6 November 1901 and continued for four weeks. Deliberations continued for a further two weeks, at which time it became clear that the indictments would be as follows:

1. In what became known as &quot;The Six Boers Case&quot;, Captains Robertson and Taylor, as well as Sgt. Maj. Morrison, were charged with committing the offense of murder while on active service.

2. In relation to what was dubbed &quot;The Van Buuren Incident&quot;, Maj. Lenahan was charged with, &quot;When on active service by culpable neglect failing to make a report which it was his duty to make.&quot;

3. In relation to &quot;The Visser Incident&quot;, Lts. Morant, Handcock, Witton, and Picton were charged with &quot;While on active service committing the offense of murder&quot;.

4. In relation to what was incorrectly dubbed &quot;The Eight Boers Case&quot;, Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton were charged with, &quot;While on active service committing the offense of murder&quot;.

In relation to the slaying of Rev Heese, Lts. Morant and Handcock were charged with, &quot;While on active service committing the offense of murder&quot;.

5. No charges were filed for the three children who had been shot by the Bushveldt Carbineers near Fort Edward.

6. In relation to what became known as &quot;The Three Boers Case&quot;, Lts. Morant and Handcock were charged with, &quot;While on active service committing the offense of murder&quot;.

Following the indictments, Maj. R. Whigham and Col. James St. Clair ordered Bolton to appear for the prosecution, as he was considered less expensive than hiring a barrister. Bolton vainly requested to be excused, writing, &quot;My knowledge of law is insufficient for so intricate a matter.&quot; The first court martial opened on 16 January 1901, with Lieut.-Col. H.C. Denny presiding over a panel of six judges. Maj. J.F. Thomas, a solicitor from Tenterfield, New South Wales, had been retained to defend Maj. Lenahan. The night before, however, he agreed to represent all six defendants. The &quot;Visser Incident&quot; was the first case to go to trial. Lt. Morant&#x27;s former orderly and interpreter, BVC Trooper Theunis J. Botha, testified that Visser, who had been promised that his life would be spared, was cooperative during two days of interrogation and that all his information was later found to have been true. Despite this, Lt. Morant ordered him shot. In response, Lt. Morant testified that he only followed orders to take no prisoners as relayed to the late Captain Hunt by Col. Hubert Hamilton. He also alleged that Floris Visser had been captured wearing a British Army jacket and that Captain Hunt&#x27;s body had been mutilated. In response, the court moved to Pretoria, where Col. Hamilton testified that he had &quot;never spoken to Captain Hunt with reference to his duties in the Northern Transvaal&quot;. Though stunned, Maj. Thomas argued that his clients were not guilty because they believed that they &quot;acted under orders&quot;. In response, Maj. Bolton argued that they were &quot;illegal orders&quot; and said, &quot;The right of killing an armed man exists only so long as he resists; as soon as he submits he is entitled to be treated as a prisoner of war.&quot; The Court ruled in Maj. Bolton&#x27;s favor. Lt. Morant was found guilty of murder. Lts. Handcock, Witton, and Picton were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter.

On 27 February 1902, two British Army Lieutenants—Anglo-Australian Harry Morant and Australian born Peter Handcock of the Bushveldt Carbineers—were executed by firing squad after being convicted of murdering eight Afrikaner POWs. This court-martial for war crimes was one of the first such prosecutions in British military history. Although Morant left a written confession in his cell, he went on to become a folk hero in modern Australia. Believed by many Australians to be the victim of a kangaroo court, public appeals have been made for Morant to be retried or pardoned. His court-martial and death have been the subject of books, a stage play, and an award-winning Australian New Wave film adaptation by director Bruce Beresford. Witton was sentenced to death, but reprieved. Due to immense political pressure for his release, he was released after serving 32 months of a life sentence. Picton was cashiered.

== Aftermath and analysis ==

The Second Boer War cast long shadows over the history of the South African region. The predominantly agrarian society of the former Boer republics was profoundly and fundamentally affected by the scorched earth policy of Roberts and Kitchener. The devastation of both Boer and black African populations in the concentration camps and through war and exile were to have a lasting effect on the demography and quality of life in the region.

Many exiles and prisoners were unable to return to their farms at all; others attempted to do so but were forced to abandon the farms as unworkable given the damage caused by farm burning in the course of the scorched earth policy. Destitute Boers and black Africans swelled the ranks of the unskilled urban poor competing with the &quot;uitlanders&quot; in the mines.

The postwar reconstruction administration was presided over by Lord Milner and his largely Oxford-educated Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten. This small group of civil servants had a profound effect on the region, eventually leading to the Union of South Africa:

Some scholars, for good reasons, identify these new identities as partly underpinning the act of union that followed in 1910. Although challenged by a Boer rebellion only four years later, they did much to shape South African politics between the two world wars and right up to the present day.

The counterinsurgency techniques and lessons (the restriction of movement, the containment of space, the ruthless targeting of anything, everything and anyone that could give sustenance to guerrillas, the relentless harassment through sweeper groups coupled with rapid reaction forces, the sourcing and co-ordination of intelligence, and the nurturing of native allies) learned during the Boer War were used by the British (and other forces) in future guerrilla campaigns including to counter Malayan communist rebels during the Malayan Emergency. In World War II the British also adopted some of the concepts of raiding from the Boer commandos when, after the fall of France, they set up their special raiding forces, and in acknowledgement of their erstwhile enemies, chose the name British Commandos.

Many of the Boers referred to the war as the second of the &quot;Freedom Wars&quot;. The most resistant of Boers wanted to continue the fight and were known as &quot;Bittereinders&quot; (or &quot;irreconcilables&quot;) and at the end of the war a number of Boer fighters such as Deneys Reitz chose exile rather than sign an oath, such as the following, to pledge allegiance to Britain:

Over the following decade, many returned to South Africa and never signed the pledge. Some, like Reitz, eventually reconciled themselves to the new &quot;status quo&quot;, but others did not.

One of the most important events in the decade after the end of the war was the creation of the Union of South Africa (later the Republic of South Africa). It proved a key ally to Britain as a Dominion of the British Empire during the World Wars. At the start of the First World War a crisis ensued when the South African government led by Louis Botha and other former Boer fighters, such as Jan Smuts, declared support for Britain and agreed to send troops to take over the German colony of German South-West Africa (Namibia).

Many Boers were opposed to fighting for Britain, especially against Germany, which had been sympathetic to their struggle. A number of &quot;bittereinders&quot; and their allies took part in a revolt known as the Maritz rebellion. The rebellion was quickly suppressed, and the leading Boer rebels escaped lightly (especially compared with the fate of leading Irish rebels of the Easter Rising), with terms of imprisonment of six and seven years and heavy fines. Two years later, they were released from prison, as Louis Botha recognised the value of reconciliation.

=== Effect of the war on domestic British politics ===


Many Irish nationalists sympathised with the Boers, viewing them to be a people oppressed by British imperialism, much like they viewed themselves. Irish miners already in the Transvaal at the start of the war formed the nucleus of two Irish commandos. The Second Irish Brigade was headed up by an Australian of Irish parents, Colonel Arthur Lynch. In addition, small groups of Irish volunteers went to South Africa to fight with the Boers—this despite the fact that there were many Irish troops fighting in the British army, including the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. In Britain, the &quot;Pro-Boer&quot; campaign expanded, with writers often idealising the Boer society.

The war also highlighted the dangers of Britain&#x27;s policy of non-alignment and deepened her isolation. The 1900 UK general election, also known as the &quot;Khaki election&quot;, was called by the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, on the back of recent British victories. There was much enthusiasm for the war at this point, resulting in a victory for the Conservative government.

However, public support quickly waned as it became apparent that the war would not be easy and it dragged on, partially contributing to the Conservatives&#x27; spectacular defeat in 1906. There was public outrage at the use of scorched earth tactics and at the conditions in the concentration camps. It also became apparent that there were serious problems with public health in Britain since up to 40% of recruits in Britain were unfit for military service and suffered from medical problems such as rickets and other poverty-related illnesses. That came at a time of increasing concern for the state of the poor in Britain.

Having taken the country into a prolonged war, the Conservative government was rejected by the electorate at the first general election after the war was over. Balfour succeeded his uncle, Lord Salisbury in 1903, immediately after the war, took over a Conservative Party that had won two successive landslide majorities but led it to a landslide defeat in 1906.

The 2nd Anglo-Boer War was a victory that costed British taxpayers more than £200m; 22,000 Empire troops, and more than 400,000 army horses, donkeys and mules were killed. Britain had expected a swift victory against a mostly unmilitarised and predominantly agricultural-based opponent. However, the conflict dragged on into the 20th century and the reign of a new monarch. At the time, Britain was the world&#x27;s most technologically advanced military. The results caused many both domestically and internationally to question the dominance of the British Empire, especially as nations like the United States, Germany, and Japan had started to become major powers.

=== Horses ===
The number of horses killed in the war was at the time unprecedented in modern warfare. For example, in the relief of Kimberley, French&#x27;s cavalry rode 500 horses to their deaths in a single day. The wastage was particularly heavy among British forces for several reasons: overloading of horses with unnecessary equipment and saddlery, failure to rest and acclimatise horses after long sea voyages and, later in the war, poor management by inexperienced mounted troops and distant control by unsympathetic staffs. The average life expectancy of a British horse, from the time of its arrival in Port Elizabeth, was around six weeks.

Most of the horses and mules brought to South Africa during the war came from the United States. In total, 109,878 horses and 81,524 mules were shipped from New Orleans to South Africa in 166 voyages from October 1899 to June 1902. The cost of these animals and their transport was an average of US$597,978 per month. A significant number of horses and mules died during the transit across the Atlantic; for example, during the SS &quot;Manchester City&quot; 36-day passage, 187 of her 2,090 mules died.

Horses were slaughtered for their meat when needed. During the sieges of Kimberley and Ladysmith, horses were consumed as food once the regular sources of meat were depleted. The besieged British forces in Ladysmith also produced &quot;chevril&quot;, a Bovril-like paste, by boiling down the horse meat to a jelly paste and serving it like beef tea.

The Horse Memorial in Port Elizabeth is a tribute to the 300,000 horses that died during the conflict.

== Imperial involvement ==
The vast majority of troops fighting for the British army came from Great Britain. Yet a significant number came from other parts of the British Empire. These countries had their own internal disputes over whether they should remain tied to London, or have full independence, which carried over into the debate around the sending of forces to assist the war. Though not fully independent on foreign affairs, these countries did have local say over how much support to provide, and the manner it was provided. Ultimately, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and British South African Company-administered Rhodesia all sent volunteers to aid the United Kingdom. Troops were also raised to fight with the British from the Cape Colony and Natal. Some Boer fighters, such as Smuts and Botha, were technically British subjects as they came from the Cape Colony and Colony of Natal, respectively.

There were also many volunteers from the Empire who were not selected for the official contingents from their countries and travelled privately to South Africa to form private units, such as the Canadian Scouts and Doyle&#x27;s Australian Scouts. There were also some European volunteer units from British India and British Ceylon, though the British Government refused offers of non-white troops from the Empire. Some Cape Coloureds also volunteered early in the war, but later some of them were effectively conscripted and kept in segregated units. As a community, they received comparatively little reward for their services. In many ways, the war set the pattern for the Empire&#x27;s later involvement in the two World Wars. Specially raised units, consisting mainly of volunteers, were dispatched overseas to serve with forces from elsewhere in the British Empire.

The United States stayed neutral in the conflict, but some American citizens were eager to participate. Early in the war Lord Roberts cabled Burnham, a veteran of both Matabele wars but at that very moment prospecting in the Klondike, to serve on his personal staff as Chief of Scouts. Burnham went on to receive the highest awards of any American who served in the war, but American mercenaries participated on both sides.

=== Australia ===


From 1899 to 1901 the six separate self-governing colonies in Australia sent their own contingents to serve in the Boer War. That much of the population of the colonies had originated from Great Britain explains a general desire to support Britain during the conflict. After the colonies formed the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the new Government of Australia sent &quot;Commonwealth&quot; contingents to the war. The Boer War was thus the first war in which the Commonwealth of Australia fought. A few Australians fought on the Boer side. The most famous and colourful character was Colonel Arthur Alfred Lynch, formerly of Ballarat, Victoria, who raised the Second Irish Brigade.

The Australian climate and geography were far closer to that of South Africa than most other parts of the empire, so Australians adapted quickly to the environment, with troops serving mostly among the army&#x27;s &quot;mounted rifles&quot;. Enlistment in all official Australian contingents totalled 16,463. Another five to seven thousand Australians served in &quot;irregular&quot; regiments raised in South Africa. Perhaps five hundred Australian irregulars were killed. In total 20,000 or more Australians served and about 1,000 were killed. A total of 267 died from disease, 251 were killed in action or died from wounds sustained in battle. A further 43 men were reported missing.

When the war began some Australians, like some Britons, opposed it. As the war dragged on some Australians became disenchanted, in part because of the sufferings of Boer civilians reported in the press. In an interesting twist (for Australians), when the British missed capturing President Paul Kruger, as he escaped Pretoria during its fall in June 1900, a &quot;Melbourne Punch&quot;, 21 June 1900, cartoon depicted how the War could be won, using the Kelly Gang.

The convictions and executions of two Australian lieutenants, Harry Harbord Morant, colloquially known as &#x27;The Breaker&#x27; for his skill with horses, and Peter Handcock in 1902, and the imprisonment of a third, George Witton, had minimal impact on the Australian public at the time despite later legend. The controversial court-martial saw the three convicted of executing Boer prisoners under their authority. After the war, though, Australians joined an empire-wide campaign that saw Witton released from jail. Much later, some Australians came to see the execution of Morant and Handcock as instances of wrongfully executed Australians, as illustrated in the 1980 Australian film &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;.

It is believed that up to 50 Aboriginal Australians served in the Boer War as trackers. According to Dale Kerwin, an Indigenous research fellow at Griffith University, such is the lack of information that is available about the trackers it is even uncertain as to whether they returned to Australia at the end of the war. He has claimed that at the end of the war in 1902 when the Australian contingents returned the trackers may not have been allowed back to Australia due to the White Australia Policy.

=== Canada ===


A total of around 8000 Canadians arrived in South Africa to fight for Britain. These arrived in two contingents: the first on 30 October 1899, the second on 21 January 1900. A third contingent of cavalry (Strathcona&#x27;s Horse) embarked for South Africa on 16/17 March 1900. They remained until May 1902. With approximately 7,368 soldiers in a combat situation, the conflict became the largest military engagement involving Canadian soldiers from the time of Confederation until the Great War. Eventually, 270 of these soldiers died in the course of the Boer War.

As one of the country&#x27;s first major wars, the arrival and movement of troops was widely documented by early war photographers. English-born (and later Canadian) Inglis Sheldon-Williams was one of the most notable, documenting the movement of hundreds of troops between North America and Southern Africa.

The Canadian public was initially divided on the decision to go to war as some citizens did not want Canada to become Britain&#x27;s &#x27;tool&#x27; for engaging in armed conflicts. Many Anglophone citizens were pro-Empire, and wanted the prime minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, to support the British in their conflict. On the other hand, many Francophone citizens felt threatened by the continuation of British imperialism to their national sovereignty.

In the end, to appease the citizens who wanted war and to avoid angering those who oppose it, Laurier sent 1,000 volunteers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Otter to aid the confederation in its war to &#x27;liberate&#x27; the peoples of the Boer controlled states in South Africa. The volunteers were provided to the British if the latter paid costs of the battalion after it arrived in South Africa.

The supporters of the war claimed that it &quot;pitted British Freedom, justice and civilization against Boer backwardness&quot;. The French Canadians&#x27; opposition to the Canadian involvement in a British &#x27;colonial venture&#x27; eventually led to a three-day riot in various areas of Quebec.

Commonwealth involvement in the Boer War can be summarised into three parts. The first part (October 1899 – December 1899) was characterised by questionable decisions and blunders from the Commonwealth leadership which affected its soldiers greatly. The soldiers of the Commonwealth were shocked at the number of Afrikaner soldiers who were willing to oppose the British. The Afrikaner troops were very willing to fight for their country and were armed with modern weaponry and were highly mobile soldiers. This was one of the best examples of Guerrilla style warfare, which would be employed throughout the twentieth century after set piece fighting was seen as a hindrance by certain groups. The Boer soldiers would evade capture and secure provisions from their enemies therefore they were able to exist as a fighting entity for an indeterminate period of time.

The end of the First part was the period in mid-December, referred to as the &quot;Black Week&quot;. During the week of 10–17 December 1899, the British suffered three major defeats at the hands of the Boers at the battlefields of Stormberg, Magersfontein and Colenso. Afterwards, the British called upon more volunteers to take part in the war from the Commonwealth.

The second part of the war (February–April 1900) was the opposite of the first. After the British reorganised and reinforced under new leadership, they began to experience success against the Boer soldiers. Commonwealth soldiers resorted to using blockhouses, farm burning and concentration camps to &#x27;persuade&#x27; the resisting Boers into submission.

The final phase of the war was the guerrilla phase in which many Boer soldiers turned to guerrilla tactics such as raiding infrastructure or communications lines. Many Canadian soldiers did not actually see combat after they had been shipped over to South Africa since many arrived around the time of the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902.

=== India ===

British garrisons in India contributed 18,534 British officers and men, as well as an estimated 10,000 Indian auxiliaries deployed to assist them. India also sent 7,000 horses, ponies and mules.

Indian auxiliaries were only employed in non-combatant roles.

The Natal Indian Ambulance Corps, created by Gandhi and financed by the local Indian community, served at the battles of Colenso and Spion Kop.

=== New Zealand ===


When the Second Boer War seemed imminent, New Zealand offered its support. On 28 September 1899, Prime Minister Richard Seddon asked Parliament to approve the offer to the imperial government of a contingent of mounted rifles, thus becoming the first British Colony to send troops to the Boer War. The British position in the dispute with the Transvaal was &quot;moderate and righteous&quot;, he maintained. He stressed the &quot;crimson tie&quot; of Empire that bound New Zealand to the mother-country and the importance of a strong British Empire for the colony&#x27;s security.

By the time peace was concluded two and a half years later, 10 contingents of volunteers, totalling nearly 6,500 men from New Zealand, with 8,000 horses had fought in the conflict, along with doctors, nurses, veterinary surgeons and a small number of school teachers. Some 70 New Zealanders died from enemy action, with another 158 killed accidentally or by disease. The first New Zealander to be killed was Farrier G.R. Bradford at Jasfontein Farm on 18 December 1899. The Boer War was greeted with extraordinary enthusiasm when the war was over, and peace was greeted with patriotism and national pride. This is best shown by the fact that the Third, Fourth and Fifth contingents from New Zealand were funded by public conscription.

=== Rhodesia ===

Rhodesian military units such as the British South Africa Police, Rhodesia Regiment and Southern Rhodesian Volunteers served in the Second Boer War.

=== South Africa ===

During the war, the British army also included substantial contingents from South Africa itself. There were large communities of English-speaking immigrants and settlers in Natal and Cape Colony (especially around Cape Town and Grahamstown), which formed volunteer units that took the field, or local &quot;town guards&quot;. At one stage of the war, a &quot;Colonial Division&quot;, consisting of five light horse and infantry units under Brigadier General Edward Brabant, took part in the invasion of the Orange Free State. Part of it withstood a siege by Christiaan de Wet at Wepener on the borders of Basutoland. Another large source of volunteers was the &quot;uitlander&quot; community, many of whom hastily left Johannesburg in the days immediately preceding the war.

Later during the war, Kitchener attempted to form a Boer Police Force, as part of his efforts to pacify the occupied areas and effect a reconciliation with the Boer community. The members of this force were despised as traitors by the Boers still in the field. Those Boers who attempted to remain neutral after giving their parole to British forces were derided as &quot;hensoppers&quot; (hands-uppers) and were often coerced into giving support to the Boer guerrillas (which formed one of the reasons for the British decision to launch scorched earth campaigns throughout the countryside and detain Boers in concentration camps in order to deny anything of use to the Boer guerrillas).

Like the Canadian and particularly the Australian and New Zealand contingents, many of the volunteer units formed by South Africans were &quot;light horse&quot; or mounted infantry, well suited to the countryside and manner of warfare. Some regular British officers scorned their comparative lack of formal discipline, but the light horse units were hardier and more suited to the demands of campaigning than the overloaded British cavalry, who were still obsessed with the charge by lance or sabre. At their peak, 24,000 South Africans (including volunteers from the Empire) served in the field in various &quot;colonial&quot; units. Notable units (in addition to the Imperial Light Horse) were the South African Light Horse, Rimington&#x27;s Guides, Kitchener&#x27;s Horse and the Imperial Light Infantry.

==== Civilians and other combatants ====
Harold Lothrop Borden – son of Canada&#x27;s Canadian Minister of Defence and Militia, Frederick William Borden. Serving in the Royal Canadian Dragoons, he became the most famous Canadian casualty of the Second Boer War. Queen Victoria asked F. W. Borden for a photograph of his son, Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier praised his services, tributes arrived from across Canada, and in his home town Canning, Nova Scotia, there is a monument (by Hamilton MacCarthy) erected to his memory.

Sam Hughes – Senior Militia officer and later a Federally elected cabinet minister. Hughes became involved in the Boer war as a member of Brigadier-General Herbert Settle&#x27;s expedition after Hughes unsuccessfully tried to raise his own brigade of soldiers. However, Hughes was dismissed and was sent home in the summer of 1900 for; sending letters back home which were published outlining British command incompetence, his impatience and boastfulness and his providing surrendering enemies favourable conditions. Hughes later became the Canadian Minister of Defence and Militia in 1911, just prior the outbreak of World War I.

John McCrae – Best known as the author of the World War I poem In Flanders Fields, McCrae started his active military service in the Boer War as an artillery officer. After completing several major campaigns, McCrae&#x27;s artillery unit was sent home to Canada in 1901 with what would be referred to today as an &#x27;honourable discharge&#x27;. McCrae ended up becoming a special professor in the University of Vermont for pathology and he would later serve in World War I as a Medical officer until his death from pneumonia while on active duty in 1918.

Harry &quot;Breaker&quot; Morant – Australian soldier who, as a commanding officer, was accused of participation in summary executions of Boer prisoners and the killing of a German missionary who had been a witness to the shootings. Morant was found guilty along with Peter Handcock and George Witton at their court-martial, with the two former being executed and the latter&#x27;s sentence commuted, and later released from British prison to return to Australia after sustained public pressure to do so.

Winston Churchill – Best known as the prime minister of Britain. During the main part of the Second Boer War, Churchill worked as a war correspondent for &quot;The Morning Post&quot;. At the age of twenty-six, he was captured and held prisoner in a camp in Pretoria from which he escaped and rejoined the British army. He received a commission in the South African Light Horse (still working as a correspondent) and witnessed the capture of Ladysmith and Pretoria.

Mahatma Gandhi – Best known as the leader of the independence movement in India, he lived in South Africa 1893–1915 where he worked on behalf of Indians. He volunteered in 1900 to help the British by forming teams of ambulance drivers and raising 1100 Indian volunteer medics. At Spioenkop Gandhi and his bearers had to carry wounded soldiers for miles to a field hospital because the terrain was too rough for the ambulances. General Redvers Buller mentioned the courage of the Indians in his dispatch. Gandhi and thirty-seven other Indians received the War Medal.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle – Author and creator of Sherlock Holmes. Served as a volunteer doctor in the Langman Field Hospital at Bloemfontein between March and June 1900. In his widely distributed and translated pamphlet &#x27;The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct&#x27; he justified both the reasonings behind the war and handling of the conflict itself. In response to complaints about concentration camps he pointed out that over 14,000 British soldiers had died of disease during the conflict (as opposed to 8,000 killed in combat) and at the height of epidemics he was seeing 50–60 British soldiers dying each day in a single ill-equipped and overwhelmed military hospital.

James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon – Future Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Served as a captain in the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles and as part of the 13th battalion of the Imperial Yeomanry. He was captured in 1900 but released due to a perforated colon and served as a deputy assistant director of the Imperial Military Railways until being evacuated to the UK due to ill-health.

Frederick Russell Burnham – American scout and adventurer who frequently assisted the British in Africa, Burnham was prospecting in the Klondike at the time of the war&#x27;s outbreak and originally was not intending to take part. However, a note from Lord Roberts reached him in Alaska, asking him to take on the role of Chief Scout of Roberts&#x27; staff if he should so choose. Burnham, on the other side of the globe, hurried to Africa and was commissioned a captain in the British army (a highly unusual practice given that Burnham was an American citizen, not a British subject). Burnham arrived at the front just before the Battle of Paardeberg and spent most of his time behind Boer lines gathering information and sabotaging railroads. Burnham was captured and escaped by the Boers twice and severely wounded at one point.

== Final overview ==

The Second Boer War was the harbinger of a new type of combat which would persevere throughout the twentieth century, guerrilla warfare. After the war was over, the entire British army underwent a period of reform which was focused on lessening the emphasis placed on mounted units in combat. It was determined that the traditional role of cavalry was antiquated and improperly used on the battlefield in the modern warfare of the Boer War, and that the First World War was the final proof that mounted attacks had no place in twentieth century combat. Cavalry was put to better use after the reforms in the theatres of the Middle East and World War I, and the idea of mounted infantry was useful in the times when the war was more mobile. An example was during the First World War during the Battle of Mons in which the British cavalry held the Belgian town against an initial German assault. Another was the use of mounted infantry at the Battle of Megiddo (1918) in which Allenby&#x27;s force routed the enemy owing to speed and dexterity of arms.

The Canadian units of the Royal Canadian Dragoons and the Royal Canadian Mounted Rifles fought in the First World War in the same role as the Boer War. However, during, and after, the Second World War the regiments swapped their horses for mechanised vehicles. It was also the beginning of types of conflict involving machine guns, shrapnel and observation balloons which were all used extensively in the First World War. To the Canadians however, attrition was the leading cause of death in the Second Boer War, with disease being the cause of approximately half of the Canadian deaths.

Both sides used a scorched Earth policy to deprive the marching enemy of food. And both had to corral civilians into makeshift huts by &#x27;concentrating&#x27; them into camps. For example, at Buffelspoort, British soldiers were held in captivity in Boer encampments after surrendering their arms, and civilians were often mixed in with service personnel because the Boers did not have the resources to do otherwise. A total of 116,000 women, children and Boer soldiers were confined to the Commonwealth concentration camps, of which at least 28,000, mainly women and children, would die. The lack of food, water, and sanitary provisions was a feature of 20th-century warfare for both civilians and armed services personnel, yet one consequence of the Boer War and investigative commissions was the implementation of The Hague Convention (1899) and Geneva Convention (1904); of which there were many further agreements thereafter.

=== Views on British tactics ===

The British saw their tactics of scorched earth and concentration camps as a legitimate way of depriving the Boer guerrillas of supplies and safe havens. The Boers saw them as a British attempt to coerce the Boers into surrender, with the camp inmates—mainly families of Boer fighters—seen as deliberately kept in poor conditions to encourage high death rates. Even in 2019, the controversy around the British tactics continued to make headlines.

== Commemorations ==

The Australian National Boer War Memorial Committee organises events to mark the war on 31 May each year. In Canberra, a commemorative service is usually held at the St John the Baptist Church in Reid. Floral tributes are laid for the dead.

<text>Mary Elizabeth Braddon (4 October 1835 – 4 February 1915) was an English popular novelist of the Victorian era. She is best known for her 1862 sensation novel &quot;Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret&quot;, which has also been dramatised and filmed several times.

==Biography==
Born in Soho, London, Mary Elizabeth Braddon was privately educated. Her mother Fanny separated from her father Henry because of his infidelities in 1840, when Braddon was five. When Braddon was ten years old, her brother Edward Braddon left for India and later Australia, where he became Premier of Tasmania. Mary worked as an actress for three years, when she was befriended by Clara and Adelaide Biddle. They were only playing minor roles, but Braddon was able to support herself and her mother. Adelaide noted that Braddon&#x27;s interest in acting waned as she began writing novels.

Braddon met John Maxwell (1824–1895), a publisher of periodicals, in April 1861 and moved in with him in 1861. However, Maxwell was already married to Mary Ann Crowley, with whom he had five children. While Maxwell and Braddon were living as husband and wife, Crowley was living with her family. In 1864, Maxwell tried to legitimize their relationship by telling the newspapers that they were legally married; &quot;however, Richard Brinsley Knowles wrote to these papers, informing them that his sister-in-law and true wife of Maxwell was still living, thereby exposing Braddon&#x27;s &#x27;wife&#x27; status as a façade&quot;. Braddon acted as stepmother to his children until 1874, when Maxwell&#x27;s wife died and they were able to get married at St. Bride&#x27;s Church in Fleet Street. Braddon had six children by him: Gerald, Fanny, Francis, William, Winifred Rosalie, and Edward Herry Harrington.Her eldest daughter, Fanny Margaret Maxwell (1863–1955), married the naturalist Edmund Selous on 13 January 1886. In the 1920s, they were living in Wyke Castle, where Fanny founded a local branch of the Woman&#x27;s Institute in 1923, of which she became the first president.

Their second eldest son was the novelist William Babington Maxwell (1866–1939).

Braddon died on 4 February 1915 in Richmond (then in Surrey) and is interred in Richmond Cemetery. Her home had been Lichfield House in the centre of the town, which was replaced by a block of flats in 1936, Lichfield Court. There is a plaque commemorating Braddon in Richmond parish church, which calls her simply &quot;Miss Braddon&quot;. A number of nearby streets are named after characters in her novels – her husband was a property developer in the area.

==Work==
===Writing===
Braddon was a prolific writer, producing more than 80 novels with inventive plots. The most famous is &quot;Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1862), which won her recognition and a fortune as a bestseller. Braddon began publishing the first chapters of her novel serially in July, 1861, in &quot;Robin Goodfellow,&quot; a literary magazine owned by Maxwell, and then later &quot;Sixpenny Magazine&quot;. &quot;Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret&quot; was then republished as a novel and sold through nine editions in its first year of publication. It has remained in print since its publication and been dramatised and filmed several times, with the first stage adaptation opening in London by the winter of 1863. 

In addition to &quot;Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret,&quot; Braddon&#x27;s other best-known novel, &quot;Aurora Floyd,&quot; was published in 1863. Since it also featured a woman trapped in a bigamous relationship, &quot;Aurora Floyd&quot; and &quot;Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret&quot; have been referred to as Braddon&#x27;s &quot;bigamy novels.&quot; Like &quot;Lady Audley, Aurora Floyd&quot; was first serialized in &quot;Temple Bar,&quot; a magazine, before appearing in novelized form.

R. D. Blackmore&#x27;s anonymous sensation novel &quot;Clara Vaughan&quot; (1864) was wrongly attributed to Braddon by some critics.

Braddon wrote several works of supernatural fiction, including the pact with the devil story &quot;Gerard or The World, the Flesh, and the Devil&quot; (1891), and the ghost stories &quot;The Cold Embrace&quot;, &quot;Eveline&#x27;s Visitant&quot; and &quot;At Chrighton Abbey&quot;. From the 1930s onwards, these stories were often anthologised in collections such as Montague Summers&#x27;s &quot;The Supernatural Omnibus&quot; (1931) and &quot;Fifty Years of Ghost Stories&quot; (1935). Braddon also wrote historical fiction. &quot;In High Places&quot; depicts the youth of Charles I. &quot;London Pride&quot; focuses on Charles II. &quot;Mohawks&quot; is set during the reign of Queen Anne. &quot;Ishmael&quot; is set at the time of Napoleon III&#x27;s rise to power.

===Publishing===

Braddon founded &quot;Belgravia&quot; magazine (1866), which presented readers with serialised sensation novels, poems, travel narratives and biographies, along with essays on fashion, history and science. It was accompanied by lavish illustrations and offered a source of literature at an affordable cost. She also edited &quot;Temple Bar&quot; magazine.

===Legacy===

There is a critical essay on Braddon&#x27;s work in Michael Sadleir&#x27;s book &quot;Things Past&quot; (1944).

In 2014 the Mary Elizabeth Braddon Association was founded to pay tribute to Braddon&#x27;s life and work.

<text>The guar (from : gvār) or cluster bean, with the botanical name Cyamopsis tetragonoloba, is an annual legume and the source of guar gum. It is also known as gavar, gawar, or guvar bean. 
The genus name &quot;Cyamopsis&quot; means &quot;bean-like&quot; (from : kýamos &quot;bean&quot; + : ópsis &quot;view&#x27;). The specific name is from meaning &quot;four-lobed&quot;.

The origin of &quot;Cyamopsis tetragonoloba&quot; is unknown, since it has never been found in the wild. It is assumed to have developed from the African species &quot;Cyamopsis senegalensis&quot;. It was further domesticated in South Asia, where it has been cultivated for centuries. 
Guar grows well in semiarid areas, but frequent rainfall is necessary.

This legume is a valuable plant in a crop rotation cycle, as it lives in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. 
Agriculturists in semi-arid regions of Rajasthan follow crop-rotation and use guar to replenish the soil with essential fertilizers and nitrogen fixation, before the next crop. Guar has many functions for human and animal nutrition, but the gelling agent in its seeds (guar gum) is the most important use. Demand is rising due to the use of guar gum in hydraulic fracturing (oil shale gas). It is also a major ingredient of the toy Slime. About 80% of world production occurs in India, but due to strong demand, the plant is being introduced elsewhere.

==Biology==
&quot;Cyamopsis tetragonoloba&quot; grows upright, reaching a maximum height of up to . 
It has a main single stem with either basal branching or fine branching along the stem. 
Guar taproots can access soil moisture in low soil depths. This legume develops root nodules with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria rhizobia in the surface part of its rooting system.
Its leaves and stems are mostly hairy, depending on the cultivar. Its fine leaves have an elongated oval shape () and of alternate position. Clusters of flowers grow in the plant axil and are white to blueish in color. The developing pods are rather flat and slim containing 5 to 12 small oval seeds of length (TGW = ). Usually mature seeds are white or gray, but with excess moisture they can turn black and lose germination capacity. The chromosome number of guar seeds is 2n=14.
The seeds of guar beans have a remarkable characteristic. Its kernel consists of a protein-rich germ (43–46%) and a relatively large endosperm (34–40%), containing large amounts of the galactomannan. This is a polysaccharide containing polymers of mannose and galactose in a ratio of 2:1 with many branches. Thus, it exhibits a great hydrogen bonding activity having a viscosifying effect in liquids.

==Cultivation==
===Climate requirements===
Guar is drought-tolerant and sun-loving, but it is susceptible to frost. Although it can cope with little but regular rainfall, it requires sufficient soil moisture before planting and during maturation of seeds. Frequent drought periods can lead to delayed maturation. On the contrary, excessive moisture during the early growth phase and after maturation lead to lower seed quality. Guar is produced near to coastal areas in the Gandhidham region of Kutch, Gujarat, India.

===Soil requirements===
&quot;Cyamopsis tetragonoloba&quot; (L.) can grow on a wide range of soil types. Preferably in fertile, medium-textured and sandy loam soils that are well-drained, since waterlogging decreases plant performance. Guar grows best in moderate alkaline conditions (pH 7–8) and is tolerant of salinity. Its taproots are inoculated with rhizobia nodules and thus it produces nitrogen-rich biomass and improves soil quality.

===Cultural practices===


===Cultivation areas===
Guar is grown principally in north-western India with smaller crops grown in the semiarid areas of the high plains of Texas in the US, Australia and Africa. The most important growing area centres on Jodhpur in Rajasthan, India, where demand for guar for fractionation produced an agricultural boom as in 2012. Currently [When? As of 2023?], India is the main producer of cluster bean, accounting for 80% production of the world&#x27;s total, while the Rajasthan, Gujarat and Kutch regions occupy the largest areas (82.1% of total) dedicated to guar cultivation. In addition to its cultivation in India, the crop is also grown as a cash crop in other parts of the world. Several commercial growers have converted their crops to guar production to support the increasing demand for guar and other organic crops in the United States.

===Varieties===
Pusa Naubahar and Pusa Sadabahar. Seeds at the rate of 30 kilograms/hectare (9–11 lb/acre) are planted at a spacing of 45–60 × 20–30 cm (18–24 × 8–12 in) in February–March and June–July. During the rainy season, seeds are sown 2–3 cm (~1 in) deep on ridges and in furrows during summer months. FYM is applied at the rate of 25 tonnes/ha (11.1 tons/acre). N, P2O5 and K2O recommendation for the crop is 20:60:80 kg/ha (18:53:71 lb/acre). Average yield is 5 to 6 tonnes/ha (2.2–2.6 tons/acre). Meager information is available for genetic variability in cluster bean addressing the qualitative traits (Pathak et al. 2011).

==Uses==

===Guar plant===
Agriculture
* Forage: Guar plants can be used as cattle feed, but due to hydrocyanic acid in its beans, only mature beans can be used.
* Green manure: Guar plantings increase the yield of subsequent crops as this legume conserves soil nutrient content.

Domestic use
* Vegetable: Guar leaves can be used like spinach, and the pods are prepared like salad or vegetables. Its beans are nutritious, but guar protein is not usable by humans unless toasted to destroy the trypsin inhibitor.

===Guar gum===

The seeds of the guar bean contain a large endosperm. This endosperm consists of a large polysaccharide of galactose and mannose. This polymer is water-soluble and exhibits a viscosifying effect in water. Guar gum has a multitude of different applications in food products, industrial products, and extractive industry.

====Food====
In several food and beverages guar gum is used as additive to change its viscosity or as fiber source.
Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is produced by the partial enzymatic hydrolysis of guaran, the galactomannan of the endosperm of guar seeds (guar gum). It is a neutral polysaccharide consisting of a mannose backbone chain with single galactose side units occurring on almost two out of every three mannose units. The average molecular weight is about 25,000 daltons. This gives a PHGG that still assays and functions as a soluble dietary fiber.

PHGG as sold commercially is completely soluble, acid and heat stable, unaffected by ions, and will not gel at high concentrations. Commercial PHGG is approximately 75% dietary fiber and has minimal effect on taste and texture in food and beverage items. PHGG is fully fermentable in the large bowel, with a high rate of volatile fatty acid formation. The pH of the feces is lowered along with an increase in fecal bulk that mainly consists of bacterial cell mass and water. Clinical studies have demonstrated a prebiotic effect of PHGG. Studies have shown that PHGG can be used to maintain regularity. PHGG is used in foods for particulate suspension, emulsification, antistaling, ice crystal control, and reduced fat baked goods.

====Industry====
Derivatives of guar gum that have been further reacted are used in industrial applications, such as the paper and textile industries, ore flotation, the manufacture of explosives and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) of oil and gas formations. Guar gum is often crosslinked with boron or chromium ions to make it more stable and heat-resistant. The crosslinking of guar with metal ions results in a gel that does not block the formation and helps efficiently in formation cleaning process. Guar and its derivatives make gel complexes with ions of aluminium, zirconium, titanium, chromium and boron. The borate–guar reaction is reversible, and depends on the pH (hydrogen ion concentration) of the solution. This reaction is used to give the toy &quot;slime&quot; its consistency. Crosslinking of guar with borate occurs at high pH (approximately 9–10) of the solution. Guar gum has proven as useful substitute for locust bean gum (made from carob seeds).

====Feeds====
Guar meal korma and guar meal churi are widely used as raw material for producing various kinds of cattle feeds, aqua feeds, fish feeds, poultry feeds, dairy feeds, swine feeds, etc.

====Fracking agent====
The use of guar gum in the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) extraction of oil and shale gas has increased demand substantially. Only 10% of Indian production is used domestically. The remaining 90% is exported for shale gas and oil industries. Consequently, many former cotton or wheat fields are converted into guar fields as production costs are lower. The increase of guar gum prices also has other reasons.

<doc id="42725" wikidata="Q2738351" url="?curid=42725" title="Lady Audley's Secret">
<text>Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret is a sensation novel by Mary Elizabeth Braddon published on 26 May 1862. It was Braddon&#x27;s most successful and well-known novel. Critic John Sutherland (1989) described the work as &quot;the most sensationally successful of all the sensation novels&quot;. The plot centres on &quot;accidental bigamy&quot; which was in literary fashion in the early 1860s. The plot was summarised by literary critic Elaine Showalter (1982): &quot;Braddon&#x27;s bigamous heroine deserts her child, pushes husband number one down a well, thinks about poisoning husband number two and sets fire to a hotel in which her other male acquaintances are residing&quot;. Elements of the novel mirror themes of the real-life Constance Kent case of June 1860 which gripped the nation for years. Braddon&#x27;s second &#x27;bigamy&#x27; novel, &quot;Aurora Floyd&quot;, appeared in 1863. Braddon set the story in Ingatestone Hall, Essex, inspired by a visit there. There have been three silent film adaptations, one UK television version in 2000, and three minor stage adaptations.

==History==
&quot;Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret&quot; was partly serialised in &quot;Robin Goodfellow&quot; magazine in July–September 1861, then entirely serialised in &quot;Sixpenny Magazine&quot; in January–December 1862 and once again serialised in &quot;The London Journal&quot; March–August 1863. It was published in 1862 in three volumes by William Tinsley.

Braddon initially sold the rights to the Irish publisher John Maxwell, with whom Braddon also lived and had children. Maxwell published it in his magazine &quot;Robin Goodfellow&quot;. Braddon wrote the final third in less than two weeks. It was published as a three-volume novel, and it became a success, allowing Braddon to be financially independent for the rest of her life. It was also a financial success for Tinsley, who went on to build a villa in Barnes, &quot;Audley Lodge&quot;, with the profits.

Notably – given the theme of bigamy in the novel&#x27;s plot – Maxwell himself was married to another woman, and so Braddon was unable to marry him until his wife died in 1874. When it became public that Maxwell and Braddon had been living in an &quot;irregular&quot; arrangement all those years, it caused a minor scandal during which all their servants .

In 1997 a Wordsworth Limited edition was released with an Introduction by Keith Carabine from the University of Kent in which he states, &quot;In the latter half of the nineteenth century, everyone knew &quot;Lady Audley’s Secret.&quot;

== Plot ==
The novel opens in June 1857 with the marriage of Lucy Graham and Sir Michael Audley. Lucy is a young, beautiful woman who enchants almost all who meet her. Sir Michael is a kindly, wealthy middle-aged widower. Lucy&#x27;s past is unclear. Prior to marrying Sir Michael she had served as governess for the children of the local doctor, Mr. Dawson, and before that she was in service with Mrs. Vincent. Very little is known about her prior to that. Shortly after the marriage Sir Michael&#x27;s nephew, the barrister Robert Audley, welcomes his old friend George Talboys back to England.

Three years before, though happily married, George&#x27;s financial situation had been desperate. He left for Australia to seek a fortune in gold prospecting. Behind him in England he had left his young wife Helen, whom he is now anxious to get news of. He reads in the newspaper that she has died, and, after visiting her home to confirm this, he becomes despondent. Robert Audley cares for his friend, and, hoping to distract him, offers to take him to his wealthy uncle&#x27;s country manor. George had a child, Georgey, who was left under the care of Lieutenant Maldon, George&#x27;s father-in-law. Robert and George set off to visit Georgey, and George decides to make Robert little Georgey&#x27;s guardian and trustee of £20,000 put into the boy&#x27;s name. After settling the matter of the boy&#x27;s guardianship, the two set off to visit Sir Michael.

While at the country manor Audley Court, Lady Audley avoids meeting George. When the two seek an audience with the new Lady Audley, she makes many excuses and avoids their visits. During her absence a thunder storm confines George and Robert to the interior of Audley Court, and the two are shown a portrait of Lady Audley. Looking back toward his friend, Robert notes that George seems disturbed, and attributes his disturbed mood to the storm. Shortly thereafter George disappears. Robert is perplexed. Unwilling to believe George simply left with no notice, Robert begins to look into the circumstances of his disappearance.

While searching for his friend, Robert takes note of the events surrounding George&#x27;s disappearance. The name of Lady Audley repeatedly appears in these notes, and much to his distress, the evidence begins to collect against her. One night, he reveals his notes to Lady Audley, including that George was in possession of many letters of his former wife. Lady Audley sets off to London, where the letters were kept. Robert follows after her. However, by the time he arrives, he discovers that George&#x27;s possessions have been broken into and the letters are missing. One possession, however, remains – a book with a note written by George&#x27;s wife that matches Lady Audley&#x27;s handwriting. This confirms Robert&#x27;s suspicion that Lady Audley is implicated in George&#x27;s disappearance; it also leads Robert to conclude that Lady Audley is actually George&#x27;s supposedly dead wife.

Suspecting the worst of Lady Audley and being afraid for little Georgey&#x27;s life, Robert travels to Lieutenant Maldon&#x27;s house and demands possession of the boy. Once Robert has Georgey under his control, he places the boy in a school run by Mr. Marchmont. Afterwards, Robert visits George&#x27;s father, Mr. Harcourt Talboys, and confronts the Squire with his son&#x27;s death. Harcourt listens dispassionately to the story. In the course of his visit to the Talboys&#x27; manor, Robert is entranced by George&#x27;s sister Clara, who looks startlingly like George. Clara&#x27;s passion for finding her brother spurs Robert on.
In February 1859, Robert continues searching for evidence. He receives a notice that his uncle is ill, and he quickly returns to Audley Court. While there, Robert speaks with Mr. Dawson and receives a brief description of all that is known about Lucy&#x27;s background. He hears that Lucy was employed by Mrs. Vincent at her school since 1852. To verify this claim, Robert tracks down Mrs. Vincent, who is in hiding because of debts. According to Miss Tonks, a teacher at Mrs. Vincent&#x27;s school, Lucy actually arrived at the school in August 1854 and was secretive about her past. Miss Tonks gives Robert a travel box that used to belong to Lucy. Upon examining stickers on the box, Robert discovers both the name Lucy Graham and the name Helen Talboys.

Robert realizes that Helen Talboys faked her death before creating her new identity. When Robert confronts Lucy, she tells him that he has no proof. He leaves to find more evidence, heading to Castle Inn, which is run by Luke Marks. During the night, Lucy forces Luke&#x27;s wife, Phoebe, to let her into the inn, then Lucy sets the place afire to kill Robert. However, Robert survives and returns to Audley Court and again confronts Lucy. This time, she says she is insane and confesses her life&#x27;s story to Robert and Sir Michael, claiming that George abandoned her originally and she had no choice but to abandon her old life and child to find another, wealthier husband.

Sir Michael is unhappy and leaves with Alicia to travel through Europe. Robert invites a Dr. Mosgrave to make a more astute judgment regarding Lucy&#x27;s sanity, and he proclaims that she is indeed victim to latent insanity, which overpowers her in times of stress and makes her very dangerous to any and all. Lucy, under the name of Madame Taylor, enters a mental institution located somewhere in Belgium along the route between Brussels and Paris. While being committed, Lucy confesses to Robert that she killed George by pushing him down a deserted well in the garden of Audley Court.

Robert grieves for his friend George until a dying Luke Marks contacts him. Before succumbing to injuries he suffered in the fire, Luke tells Robert that George survived Lady Audley&#x27;s attempted murder. Luke then helped George escape, with George intending to return to Australia. Robert is overjoyed, and he asks Clara to marry him and go with him to Australia to find George. Clara accepts, but before they set out, George returns and reveals that he actually visited New York instead. The narrative ends with the death of Lucy abroad, and Clara and Robert happily married and living in a country cottage with George and his son. Robert&#x27;s formerly infatuated cousin Alicia marries her once-spurned suitor, Sir Harry Towers, and Audley Court is left abandoned along with all of its unhappy memories.

== Analysis and themes ==
&quot;Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret&quot; plays on Victorian anxieties about the domestic sphere. The home was supposed to be a refuge from the dangers of the outside world, but in the novel, the seemingly perfect domestic lady turns out to be a violent criminal who has not only tried to commit murder but who has also committed bigamy and abandoned her child. This unsettled Victorian readers because it indicated that the concepts of &quot;the perfect lady/mother&quot; and &quot;domestic bliss&quot; were more idealistic than realistic. In addition, anxieties about the increasing urbanization of Britain abound; the city gives Lady Audley the power to change her identity because it renders its citizens effectively anonymous. The small town of Audley is no longer a refuge where everyone knows the life story of every neighbor; the residents of Audley must accept Lucy Graham&#x27;s account of herself since they have no other information about her past. Other anxieties about unstable identity appear throughout the novel: Lady Audley&#x27;s maid, Phoebe, resembles Lady Audley, thus banishing the idea of physical distinction between the upper and lower classes and therefore of any inherent superiority of the former.

&quot;Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret&quot; is, furthermore, a story about gender and class, and Lady Audley&#x27;s objectionable upward mobility suggests a threat to the paradigm of social class. Madness is also a key issue. Lady Audley and others often converse about the meaning of this word, but many readers believe that Lady Audley is not mad. In fact, many critics view Lady Audley&#x27;s deception as a feminist act in which a woman takes control of the direction of her own life.

The novel mirrors many of the same themes from the real-life Constance Kent case of June 1860. The first instalment of &quot;Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret&quot; came out almost exactly one year after the Kent murder. The novel, like the real-life case, featured a stepmother and former governess, a mysterious and brutal murder in a country manor house, a body thrown down a well, and characters fascinated by madness. Constance Kent can be seen in many of the female characters in the novel: the murderess Lady Audley, the tomboyish Alicia Audley, the restrained Phoebe Marks and the lonely Clara Talboys. Jack Whicher, the detective and case investigator, can be seen in the character of Robert Audley.

<doc id="42726" wikidata="Q128257" url="?curid=42726" title="Cephalopod">
<text>A cephalopod is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , ; &quot;head-feet&quot;) such as a squid, octopus, cuttlefish, or nautilus. These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishers sometimes call cephalopods &quot;inkfish&quot;, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology.

Cephalopods became dominant during the Ordovician period, represented by primitive nautiloids. The class now contains two, only distantly related, extant subclasses: Coleoidea, which includes octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish; and Nautiloidea, represented by &quot;Nautilus&quot; and &quot;Allonautilus&quot;. In the Coleoidea, the molluscan shell has been internalized or is absent, whereas in the Nautiloidea, the external shell remains. About 800 living species of cephalopods have been identified. Two important extinct taxa are the Ammonoidea (ammonites) and Belemnoidea (belemnites). Extant cephalopods range in size from the 10 mm (0.3 in) &quot;Idiosepius thailandicus&quot; to the 700 kilograms (1,500 lb) heavy colossal squid, the largest extant invertebrate.

==Distribution==

There are over 800 extant species of cephalopod, although new species continue to be described. An estimated 11,000 extinct taxa have been described, although the soft-bodied nature of cephalopods means they are not easily fossilised.

Cephalopods are found in all the oceans of Earth. None of them can tolerate fresh water, but the brief squid, &quot;Lolliguncula brevis&quot;, found in Chesapeake Bay, is a notable partial exception in that it tolerates brackish water. Cephalopods are thought to be unable to live in fresh water due to multiple biochemical constraints, and in their &gt;400 million year existence have never ventured into fully freshwater habitats.

Cephalopods occupy most of the depth of the ocean, from the abyssal plains to the sea surface, and have also been found in the hadal zone. Their diversity is greatest near the equator (~40 species retrieved in nets at 11°N by a diversity study) and decreases towards the poles (~5 species captured at 60°N).

==Biology==
=== Nervous system and behavior ===
Cephalopods are widely regarded as the most intelligent of the invertebrates and have well-developed senses and large brains (larger than those of gastropods). The nervous system of cephalopods is the most complex of the invertebrates and their brain-to-body-mass ratio falls between that of endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates. Captive cephalopods have also been known to climb out of their aquaria, maneuver a distance of the lab floor, enter another aquarium to feed on captive crabs, and return to their own aquarium.

The brain is protected in a cartilaginous cranium. The giant nerve fibers of the cephalopod mantle have been widely used for many years as experimental material in neurophysiology; their large diameter (due to lack of myelination) makes them relatively easy to study compared with other animals.

Many cephalopods are social creatures; when isolated from their own kind, some species have been observed shoaling with fish.

Some cephalopods are able to fly through the air for distances of up to . While cephalopods are not particularly aerodynamic, they achieve these impressive ranges by jet-propulsion; water continues to be expelled from the funnel while the organism is in the air. The animals spread their fins and tentacles to form wings and actively control lift force with body posture. One species, &quot;Todarodes pacificus&quot;, has been observed spreading tentacles in a flat fan shape with a mucus film between the individual tentacles, while another, &quot;Sepioteuthis sepioidea&quot;, has been observed putting the tentacles in a circular arrangement.

===Senses===
Cephalopods have advanced vision, can detect gravity with statocysts, and have a variety of chemical sense organs. Octopuses use their arms to explore their environment and can use them for depth perception.

====Vision====

Most cephalopods rely on vision to detect predators and prey and to communicate with one another. Consequently, cephalopod vision is acute: training experiments have shown that the common octopus can distinguish the brightness, size, shape, and horizontal or vertical orientation of objects. The morphological construction gives cephalopod eyes the same performance as shark eyes; however, their construction differs, as cephalopods lack a cornea and have an everted retina. Cephalopods&#x27; eyes are also sensitive to the plane of polarization of light. Unlike many other cephalopods, nautiluses do not have good vision; their eye structure is highly developed, but lacks a solid lens. They have a simple &quot;pinhole&quot; eye through which water can pass. Instead of vision, the animal is thought to use olfaction as the primary sense for foraging, as well as locating or identifying potential mates.
All octopuses and most cephalopods are considered to be color blind. Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, squid, cuttlefish) have a single photoreceptor type and lack the ability to determine color by comparing detected photon intensity across multiple spectral channels. When camouflaging themselves, they use their chromatophores to change brightness and pattern according to the background they see, but their ability to match the specific color of a background may come from cells such as iridophores and leucophores that reflect light from the environment. They also produce visual pigments throughout their body and may sense light levels directly from their body. Evidence of color vision has been found in the sparkling enope squid (&quot;Watasenia scintillans&quot;). It achieves color vision with three photoreceptors, which are based on the same opsin, but use distinct retinal molecules as chromophores: A1 (retinal), A3 (3-dehydroretinal), and A4 (4-hydroxyretinal). The A1-photoreceptor is most sensitive to green-blue (484 nm), the A2-photoreceptor to blue-green (500 nm), and the A4-photoreceptor to blue (470 nm) light.

In 2015, a novel mechanism for spectral discrimination in cephalopods was described. This relies on the exploitation of chromatic aberration (wavelength-dependence of focal length). Numerical modeling shows that chromatic aberration can yield useful chromatic information through the dependence of image acuity on accommodation. The unusual off-axis slit and annular pupil shapes in cephalopods enhance this ability by acting as prisms which are scattering white light in all directions.

====Photoreception====
In 2015, molecular evidence was published indicating that cephalopod chromatophores are photosensitive; reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) revealed transcripts encoding rhodopsin and retinochrome within the retinas and skin of the longfin inshore squid (&quot;Doryteuthis pealeii&quot;), and the common cuttlefish (&quot;Sepia officinalis&quot;) and broadclub cuttlefish (&quot;Sepia latimanus&quot;). The authors claim this is the first evidence that cephalopod dermal tissues may possess the required combination of molecules to respond to light.

====Hearing====
Some squids have been shown to detect sound using their statocysts, but, in general, cephalopods are deaf.

===Use of light===

Most cephalopods possess an assemblage of skin components that interact with light. These may include iridophores, leucophores, chromatophores and (in some species) photophores. Chromatophores are colored pigment cells that expand and contract in accordance to produce color and pattern which they can use in a startling array of fashions. As well as providing camouflage with their background, some cephalopods bioluminesce, shining light downwards to disguise their shadows from any predators that may lurk below. The bioluminescence is produced by bacterial symbionts; the host cephalopod is able to detect the light produced by these organisms. Bioluminescence may also be used to entice prey, and some species use colorful displays to impress mates, startle predators, or even communicate with one another.

=== Coloration ===
Cephalopods can change their colors and patterns in milliseconds, whether for signalling (both within the species and for warning) or active camouflage, as their chromatophores are expanded or contracted. Although color changes appear to rely primarily on vision input, there is evidence that skin cells, specifically chromatophores, can detect light and adjust to light conditions independently of the eyes. The octopus changes skin color and texture during quiet and active sleep cycles.

Cephalopods can use chromatophores like a muscle, which is why they can change their skin hue as rapidly as they do.
Coloration is typically stronger in near-shore species than those living in the open ocean, whose functions tend to be restricted to disruptive camouflage. These chromatophores are found throughout the body of the octopus, however, they are controlled by the same part of the brain that controls elongation during jet propulsion to reduce drag. As such, jetting octopuses can turn pale because the brain is unable to achieve both controlling elongation and controlling the chromatophores. Most octopuses mimic select structures in their field of view rather than becoming a composite color of their full background.

Evidence of original coloration has been detected in cephalopod fossils dating as far back as the Silurian; these orthoconic individuals bore concentric stripes, which are thought to have served as camouflage. Devonian cephalopods bear more complex color patterns, of unknown function.

=== Chromatophores ===
Coleoids, a shell-less subclass of cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, and octopuses), have complex pigment containing cells called chromatophores which are capable of producing rapidly changing color patterns. These cells store pigment within an elastic sac which produces the color seen from these cells. Coleoids can change the shape of this sac, called the cytoelastic sacculus, which then causes changes in the translucency and opacity of the cell. By rapidly changing multiple chromatophores of different colors, cephalopods are able to change the color of their skin at astonishing speeds, an adaptation that is especially notable in an organism that sees in black and white. Chromatophores are known to only contain three pigments, red, yellow, and brown, which cannot create the full color spectrum. However, cephalopods also have cells called iridophores, thin, layered protein cells that reflect light in ways that can produce colors chromatophores cannot. The mechanism of iridophore control is unknown, but chromatophores are under the control of neural pathways, allowing the cephalopod to coordinate elaborate displays. Together, chromatophores and iridophores are able to produce a large range of colors and pattern displays.

==== Adaptive value ====
Cephalopods utilize chromatophores&#x27; color changing ability in order to camouflage themselves. Chromatophores allow coleoids to blend into many different environments, from coral reefs to the sandy sea floor. The color change of chromatophores works in concert with papillae, epithelial tissue which grows and deforms through hydrostatic motion to change skin texture. Chromatophores are able to perform two types of camouflage, mimicry and color matching. Mimicry is when an organism changes its appearance to appear like a different organism. The squid &quot;Sepioteuthis sepioidea&quot; has been documented changing its appearance to appear as the non threatening herbivorous parrotfish to approach unaware prey. The octopus &quot;Thaumoctopus mimicus&quot; is known to mimic a number of different venomous organisms it cohabitates with to deter predators. While background matching, a cephalopod changes its appearance to resemble its surroundings, hiding from its predators or concealing itself from prey. The ability to both mimic other organisms and match the appearance of their surroundings is notable given that cephalopods&#x27; vision is monochromatic.

Cephalopods also use their fine control of body coloration and patterning to perform complex signaling displays for both conspecific and intraspecific communication. Coloration is used in concert with locomotion and texture to send signals to other organisms. Intraspecifically this can serve as a warning display to potential predators. For example, when the octopus &quot;Callistoctopus macropus&quot; is threatened, it will turn a bright red brown color speckled with white dots as a high contrast display to startle predators. Conspecifically, color change is used for both mating displays and social communication. Cuttlefish have intricate mating displays from males to females. There is also male to male signaling that occurs during competition over mates, all of which are the product of chromatophore coloration displays.

==== Origin ====
There are two hypotheses about the evolution of color change in cephalopods. One hypothesis is that the ability to change color may have evolved for social, sexual, and signaling functions. Another explanation is that it first evolved because of selective pressures encouraging predator avoidance and stealth hunting.

For color change to have evolved as the result of social selection the environment of cephalopods&#x27; ancestors would have to fit a number of criteria. One, there would need to be some kind of mating ritual that involved signaling. Two, they would have to experience demonstrably high levels of sexual selection. And three, the ancestor would need to communicate using sexual signals that are visible to a conspecific receiver. For color change to have evolved as the result of natural selection different parameters would have to be met. For one, one would need some phenotypic diversity in body patterning among the population. The species would also need to cohabitate with predators which rely on vision for prey identification. These predators should have a high range of visual sensitivity, detecting not just motion or contrast but also colors. The habitats they occupy would also need to display a diversity of backgrounds. Experiments done in dwarf chameleons testing these hypotheses showed that chameleon taxa with greater capacity for color change had more visually conspicuous social signals but did not come from more visually diverse habitats, suggesting that color change ability likely evolved to facilitate social signaling, while camouflage is a useful byproduct. Because camouflage is used for multiple adaptive purposes in cephalopods, color change could have evolved for one use and the other developed later, or it evolved to regulate trade offs within both.

==== Convergent evolution ====
Color change is widespread in ectotherms including anoles, frogs, mollusks, many fish, insects, and spiders. The mechanism behind this color change can be either morphological or physiological. Morphological change is the result of a change in the density of pigment containing cells and tends to change over longer periods of time. Physiological change, the kind observed in cephalopod lineages, is typically the result of the movement of pigment within the chromatophore, changing where different pigments are localized within the cell. This physiological change typically occurs on much shorter timescales compared to morphological change. Cephalopods have a rare form of physiological color change which utilizes neural control of muscles to change the morphology of their chromatophores. This neural control of chromatophores has evolved convergently in both cephalopods and teleosts fishes.

===Ink===

With the exception of the Nautilidae and the species of octopus belonging to the suborder Cirrina, all known cephalopods have an ink sac, which can be used to expel a cloud of dark ink to confuse predators. This sac is a muscular bag which originated as an extension of the hindgut. It lies beneath the gut and opens into the anus, into which its contents – almost pure melanin – can be squirted; its proximity to the base of the funnel means the ink can be distributed by ejected water as the cephalopod uses its jet propulsion. The ejected cloud of melanin is usually mixed, upon expulsion, with mucus, produced elsewhere in the mantle, and therefore forms a thick cloud, resulting in visual (and possibly chemosensory) impairment of the predator, like a smokescreen. However, a more sophisticated behavior has been observed, in which the cephalopod releases a cloud, with a greater mucus content, that approximately resembles the cephalopod that released it (this decoy is referred to as a pseudomorph). This strategy often results in the predator attacking the pseudomorph, rather than its rapidly departing prey. For more information, see Inking behaviors.

The ink sac of cephalopods has led to a common name of &quot;inkfish&quot;, formerly the pen-and-ink fish.

===Circulatory system===
Cephalopods are the only molluscs with a closed circulatory system. Coleoids have two gill hearts (also known as branchial hearts) that move blood through the capillaries of the gills. A single systemic heart then pumps the oxygenated blood through the rest of the body.

Like most molluscs, cephalopods use hemocyanin, a copper-containing protein, rather than hemoglobin, to transport oxygen. As a result, their blood is colorless when deoxygenated and turns blue when bonded to oxygen. In oxygen-rich environments and in acidic water, hemoglobin is more efficient, but in environments with little oxygen and in low temperatures, hemocyanin has the upper hand. The hemocyanin molecule is much larger than the hemoglobin molecule, allowing it to bond with 96 or molecules, instead of the hemoglobin&#x27;s just four. But unlike hemoglobin, which are attached in millions on the surface of a single red blood cell, hemocyanin molecules float freely in the bloodstream.

===Respiration===
Cephalopods exchange gases with the seawater by forcing water through their gills, which are attached to the roof of the organism. Water enters the mantle cavity on the outside of the gills, and the entrance of the mantle cavity closes. When the mantle contracts, water is forced through the gills, which lie between the mantle cavity and the funnel. The water&#x27;s expulsion through the funnel can be used to power jet propulsion. If respiration is used concurrently with jet propulsion, large losses in speed or oxygen generation can be expected. The gills, which are much more efficient than those of other mollusks, are attached to the ventral surface of the mantle cavity. There is a trade-off with gill size regarding lifestyle. To achieve fast speeds, gills need to be small – water will be passed through them quickly when energy is needed, compensating for their small size. However, organisms which spend most of their time moving slowly along the bottom do not naturally pass much water through their cavity for locomotion; thus they have larger gills, along with complex systems to ensure that water is constantly washing through their gills, even when the organism is stationary. The water flow is controlled by contractions of the radial and circular mantle cavity muscles.

The gills of cephalopods are supported by a skeleton of robust fibrous proteins; the lack of mucopolysaccharides distinguishes this matrix from cartilage. The gills are also thought to be involved in excretion, with NH4+ being swapped with K+ from the seawater.

=== Locomotion and buoyancy ===

While most cephalopods can move by jet propulsion, this is a very energy-consuming way to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish. The efficiency of a propeller-driven waterjet (i.e. Froude efficiency) is greater than a rocket. The relative efficiency of jet propulsion decreases further as animal size increases; paralarvae are far more efficient than juvenile and adult individuals. Since the Paleozoic era, as competition with fish produced an environment where efficient motion was crucial to survival, jet propulsion has taken a back role, with fins and tentacles used to maintain a steady velocity. Whilst jet propulsion is never the sole mode of locomotion, the stop-start motion provided by the jets continues to be useful for providing bursts of high speed – not least when capturing prey or avoiding predators. Indeed, it makes cephalopods the fastest marine invertebrates, and they can out-accelerate most fish. The jet is supplemented with fin motion; in the squid, the fins flap each time that a jet is released, amplifying the thrust; they are then extended between jets (presumably to avoid sinking). Oxygenated water is taken into the mantle cavity to the gills and through muscular contraction of this cavity, the spent water is expelled through the hyponome, created by a fold in the mantle. The size difference between the posterior and anterior ends of this organ control the speed of the jet the organism can produce. The velocity of the organism can be accurately predicted for a given mass and morphology of animal. Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out anteriorly through the hyponome, but direction can be controlled somewhat by pointing it in different directions. Some cephalopods accompany this expulsion of water with a gunshot-like popping noise, thought to function to frighten away potential predators.

Cephalopods employ a similar method of propulsion despite their increasing size (as they grow) changing the dynamics of the water in which they find themselves. Thus their paralarvae do not extensively use their fins (which are less efficient at low Reynolds numbers) and primarily use their jets to propel themselves upwards, whereas large adult cephalopods tend to swim less efficiently and with more reliance on their fins.

Early cephalopods are thought to have produced jets by drawing their body into their shells, as &quot;Nautilus&quot; does today. &quot;Nautilus&quot; is also capable of creating a jet by undulations of its funnel; this slower flow of water is more suited to the extraction of oxygen from the water. When motionless, &quot;Nautilus&quot; can only extract 20% of oxygen from the water. The jet velocity in &quot;Nautilus&quot; is much slower than in coleoids, but less musculature and energy is involved in its production. Jet thrust in cephalopods is controlled primarily by the maximum diameter of the funnel orifice (or, perhaps, the average diameter of the funnel) and the diameter of the mantle cavity. Changes in the size of the orifice are used most at intermediate velocities. The absolute velocity achieved is limited by the cephalopod&#x27;s requirement to inhale water for expulsion; this intake limits the maximum velocity to eight body-lengths per second, a speed which most cephalopods can attain after two funnel-blows. Water refills the cavity by entering not only through the orifices, but also through the funnel. Squid can expel up to 94% of the fluid within their cavity in a single jet thrust. To accommodate the rapid changes in water intake and expulsion, the orifices are highly flexible and can change their size by a factor of 20; the funnel radius, conversely, changes only by a factor of around 1.5.

Some octopus species are also able to walk along the seabed. Squids and cuttlefish can move short distances in any direction by rippling of a flap of muscle around the mantle.

While most cephalopods float (i.e. are neutrally buoyant or nearly so; in fact most cephalopods are about 2–3% denser than seawater), they achieve this in different ways.
Some, such as &quot;Nautilus&quot;, allow gas to diffuse into the gap between the mantle and the shell; others allow purer water to ooze from their kidneys, forcing out denser salt water from the body cavity; others, like some fish, accumulate oils in the liver; and some octopuses have a gelatinous body with lighter chloride ions replacing sulfate in the body chemistry.

Squids are the primary sufferers of negative buoyancy in cephalopods. The negative buoyancy means that some squids, especially those whose habitat depths are rather shallow, have to actively regulate their vertical positions. This means that they must expend energy, often through jetting or undulations, in order to maintain the same depth. As such, the cost of transport of many squids are quite high. That being said, squid and other cephalopod that dwell in deep waters tend to be more neutrally buoyant which removes the need to regulate depth and increases their locomotory efficiency.

The &quot;Macrotritopus defilippi&quot;, or the sand-dwelling octopus, was seen mimicking both the coloration and the swimming movements of the sand-dwelling flounder &quot;Bothus lunatus&quot; to avoid predators. The octopuses were able to flatten their bodies and put their arms back to appear the same as the flounders as well as move with the same speed and movements.

Females of two species, &quot;Ocythoe tuberculata&quot; and &quot;Haliphron atlanticus&quot;, have evolved a true swim bladder.

==== Octopus vs. squid locomotion ====
Two of the categories of cephalopods, octopus and squid, are vastly different in their movements despite being of the same class. Octopuses are generally not seen as active swimmers; they are often found scavenging the sea floor instead of swimming long distances through the water. Squid, on the other hand, can be found to travel vast distances, with some moving as much as 2,000 km in 2.5 months at an average pace of 0.9 body lengths per second. There is a major reason for the difference in movement type and efficiency: anatomy.

Both octopuses and squids have mantles (referenced above) which function towards respiration and locomotion in the form of jetting. The composition of these mantles differs between the two families, however. In octopuses, the mantle is made up of three muscle types: longitudinal, radial, and circular. The longitudinal muscles run parallel to the length of the octopus and they are used in order to keep the mantle the same length throughout the jetting process. Given that they are muscles, it can be noted that this means the octopus must actively flex the longitudinal muscles during jetting in order to keep the mantle at a constant length. The radial muscles run perpendicular to the longitudinal muscles and are used to thicken and thin the wall of the mantle. Finally, the circular muscles are used as the main activators in jetting. They are muscle bands that surround the mantle and expand/contract the cavity. All three muscle types work in unison to produce a jet as a propulsion mechanism.

Squids do not have the longitudinal muscles that octopus do. Instead, they have a tunic. This tunic is made of layers of collagen and it surrounds the top and the bottom of the mantle. Because they are made of collagen and not muscle, the tunics are rigid bodies that are much stronger than the muscle counterparts. This provides the squids some advantages for jet propulsion swimming. The stiffness means that there is no necessary muscle flexing to keep the mantle the same size. In addition, tunics take up only 1% of the squid mantle&#x27;s wall thickness, whereas the longitudinal muscle fibers take up to 20% of the mantle wall thickness in octopuses. Also because of the rigidity of the tunic, the radial muscles in squid can contract more forcefully.

The mantle is not the only place where squids have collagen. Collagen fibers are located throughout the other muscle fibers in the mantle. These collagen fibers act as elastics and are sometimes named &quot;collagen springs&quot;. As the name implies, these fibers act as springs. When the radial and circular muscles in the mantle contract, they reach a point where the contraction is no longer efficient to the forward motion of the creature. In such cases, the excess contraction is stored in the collagen which then efficiently begins or aids in the expansion of the mantle at the end of the jet. In some tests, the collagen has been shown to be able to begin raising mantle pressure up to 50ms before muscle activity is initiated.

These anatomical differences between squid and octopuses can help explain why squid can be found swimming comparably to fish while octopuses usually rely on other forms of locomotion on the sea floor such as bipedal walking, crawling, and non-jetting swimming.

===Shell===

Nautiluses are the only extant cephalopods with a true external shell. However, all molluscan shells are formed from the ectoderm (outer layer of the embryo); in cuttlefish (&quot;Sepia&quot; spp.), for example, an invagination of the ectoderm forms during the embryonic period, resulting in a shell (cuttlebone) that is internal in the adult. The same is true of the chitinous gladius of squid and octopuses. Cirrate octopods have arch-shaped cartilaginous fin supports, which are sometimes referred to as a &quot;shell vestige&quot; or &quot;gladius&quot;. The Incirrina have either a pair of rod-shaped stylets or no vestige of an internal shell, and some squid also lack a gladius. The shelled coleoids do not form a clade or even a paraphyletic group. The &quot;Spirula&quot; shell begins as an organic structure, and is then very rapidly mineralized. Shells that are &quot;lost&quot; may be lost by resorption of the calcium carbonate component.

Females of the octopus genus &quot;Argonauta&quot; secrete a specialized paper-thin egg case in which they reside, and this is popularly regarded as a &quot;shell&quot;, although it is not attached to the body of the animal and has a separate evolutionary origin.

The largest group of shelled cephalopods, the ammonites, are extinct, but their shells are very common as fossils.

The deposition of carbonate, leading to a mineralized shell, appears to be related to the acidity of the organic shell matrix (see Mollusc shell); shell-forming cephalopods have an acidic matrix, whereas the gladius of squid has a basic matrix. The basic arrangement of the cephalopod outer wall is: an outer (spherulitic) prismatic layer, a laminar (nacreous) layer and an inner prismatic layer. The thickness of every layer depends on the taxa. In modern cephalopods, the Ca carbonate is aragonite. As for other mollusc shells or coral skeletons, the smallest visible units are irregular rounded granules.

===Head appendages===

Cephalopods, as the name implies, have muscular appendages extending from their heads and surrounding their mouths. These are used in feeding, mobility, and even reproduction. In coleoids they number eight or ten. Decapods such as cuttlefish and squid have five pairs. The longer two, termed &quot;tentacles&quot;, are actively involved in capturing prey; they can lengthen rapidly (in as little as 15 milliseconds). In giant squid, they may reach a length of 8 metres. They may terminate in a broadened, sucker-coated club. The shorter four pairs are termed &quot;arms&quot;, and are involved in holding and manipulating the captured organism. They too have suckers, on the side closest to the mouth; these help to hold onto the prey. Octopods only have four pairs of sucker-coated arms, as the name suggests, though developmental abnormalities can modify the number of arms expressed.

The tentacle consists of a thick central nerve cord (which must be thick to allow each sucker to be controlled independently) surrounded by circular and radial muscles. Because the volume of the tentacle remains constant, contracting the circular muscles decreases the radius and permits the rapid increase in length. Typically, a 70% lengthening is achieved by decreasing the width by 23%. The shorter arms lack this capability.

The size of the tentacle is related to the size of the buccal cavity; larger, stronger tentacles can hold prey as small bites are taken from it; with more numerous, smaller tentacles, prey is swallowed whole, so the mouth cavity must be larger.

Externally shelled nautilids (&quot;Nautilus&quot; and &quot;Allonautilus&quot;) have on the order of 90 finger-like appendages, termed &quot;tentacles&quot;, which lack suckers but are sticky instead, and are partly retractable.

===Feeding===

All living cephalopods have a two-part beak; most have a radula, although it is reduced in most octopus and absent altogether in &quot;Spirula&quot;. They feed by capturing prey with their tentacles, drawing it into their mouth and taking bites from it. They have a mixture of toxic digestive juices, some of which are manufactured by symbiotic algae, which they eject from their salivary glands onto their captured prey held in their mouths. These juices separate the flesh of their prey from the bone or shell. The salivary gland has a small tooth at its end which can be poked into an organism to digest it from within.

The digestive gland itself is rather short. It has four elements, with food passing through the crop, stomach and caecum before entering the intestine. Most digestion, as well as the absorption of nutrients, occurs in the digestive gland, sometimes called the liver. Nutrients and waste materials are exchanged between the gut and the digestive gland through a pair of connections linking the gland to the junction of the stomach and caecum. Cells in the digestive gland directly release pigmented excretory chemicals into the lumen of the gut, which are then bound with mucus passed through the anus as long dark strings, ejected with the aid of exhaled water from the funnel. Cephalopods tend to concentrate ingested heavy metals in their body tissue. However, octopus arms use a family of cephalopod-specific chemotactile receptors (CRs) to be their &quot;taste by touch&quot; system.

==== Radula ====
The cephalopod radula consists of multiple symmetrical rows of up to nine teeth – thirteen in fossil classes. The organ is reduced or even vestigial in certain octopus species and is absent in &quot;Spirula&quot;. The teeth may be homodont (i.e. similar in form across a row), heterodont (otherwise), or ctenodont (comb-like). Their height, width and number of cusps is variable between species. The pattern of teeth repeats, but each row may not be identical to the last; in the octopus, for instance, the sequence repeats every five rows.

Cephalopod radulae are known from fossil deposits dating back to the Ordovician. They are usually preserved within the cephalopod&#x27;s body chamber, commonly in conjunction with the mandibles; but this need not always be the case; many radulae are preserved in a range of settings in the Mason Creek. Radulae are usually difficult to detect, even when they are preserved in fossils, as the rock must weather and crack in exactly the right fashion to expose them; for instance, radulae have only been found in nine of the 43 ammonite genera, and they are rarer still in non-ammonoid forms: only three pre-Mesozoic species possess one.

=== Excretory system ===
Most cephalopods possess a single pair of large nephridia. Filtered nitrogenous waste is produced in the pericardial cavity of the branchial hearts, each of which is connected to a nephridium by a narrow canal. The canal delivers the excreta to a bladder-like renal sac, and also resorbs excess water from the filtrate. Several outgrowths of the lateral vena cava project into the renal sac, continuously inflating and deflating as the branchial hearts beat. This action helps to pump the secreted waste into the sacs, to be released into the mantle cavity through a pore.

&quot;Nautilus&quot;, unusually, possesses four nephridia, none of which are connected to the pericardial cavities.

The incorporation of ammonia is important for shell formation in terrestrial molluscs and other non-molluscan lineages. Because protein (i.e., flesh) is a major constituent of the cephalopod diet, large amounts of ammonium ions are produced as waste. The main organs involved with the release of this excess ammonium are the gills. The rate of release is lowest in the shelled cephalopods &quot;Nautilus&quot; and &quot;Sepia&quot; as a result of their using nitrogen to fill their shells with gas to increase buoyancy. Other cephalopods use ammonium in a similar way, storing the ions (as ammonium chloride) to reduce their overall density and increase buoyancy.

=== Reproduction and life cycle ===


Cephalopods are a diverse group of species, but share common life history traits, for example, they have a rapid growth rate and short life spans. Stearns (1992) suggested that in order to produce the largest possible number of viable offspring, spawning events depend on the ecological environmental factors of the organism. The majority of cephalopods do not provide parental care to their offspring, except, for example, octopus, which helps this organism increase the survival rate of their offspring. Marine species&#x27; life cycles are affected by various environmental conditions. The development of a cephalopod embryo can be greatly affected by temperature, oxygen saturation, pollution, light intensity, and salinity. These factors are important to the rate of embryonic development and the success of hatching of the embryos. Food availability also plays an important role in the reproductive cycle of cephalopods. A limitation of food influences the timing of spawning along with their function and growth. Spawning time and spawning vary among marine species; it&#x27;s correlated with temperature, though cephalopods in shallow water spawn in cold months so that the offspring would hatch at warmer temperatures. Breeding can last from several days to a month.

==== Sexual maturity ====
Cephalopods that are sexually mature and of adult size begin spawning and reproducing. After the transfer of genetic material to the following generation, the adult cephalopods in most species then die. Sexual maturation in male and female cephalopods can be observed internally by the enlargement of gonads and accessory glands. Mating would be a poor indicator of sexual maturation in females; they can receive sperm when not fully reproductively mature and store them until they are ready to fertilize the eggs. Males are more aggressive in their pre-mating competition when in the presence of immature females than when competing for a sexually mature female. Most cephalopod males develop a hectocotylus, an arm tip which is capable of transferring their spermatozoa into the female mantle cavity. Though not all species use a hectocotylus; for example, the adult nautilus releases a spadix. Some male squids, mainly deep-water species, have instead evolved a penis longer than their own body length, the longest penis in any free-living animals. It is assumed these males simply attach a spermatophore anywhere on a female&#x27;s body. An indication of sexual maturity of females is the development of brachial photophores to attract mates.

==== Fertilization ====
Cephalopods are not broadcast spawners. During the process of fertilization, the females use sperm provided by the male via external fertilization. Internal fertilization is seen only in octopuses. The initiation of copulation begins when the male catches a female and wraps his arm around her, either in a &quot;male to female neck&quot; position or mouth to mouth position, depending on the species. The males then initiate the process of fertilization by contracting their mantle several times to release the spermatozoa. Cephalopods often mate several times, which influences males to mate longer with females that have previously, nearly tripling the number of contractions of the mantle. To ensure the fertilization of the eggs, female cephalopods release a sperm-attracting peptide through the gelatinous layers of the egg to direct the spermatozoa. Female cephalopods lay eggs in clutches; each egg is composed of a protective coat to ensure the safety of the developing embryo when released into the water column. Reproductive strategies differ between cephalopod species. In the giant Pacific octopus, large eggs are laid in a den; it will often take several days to lay all of them. Once the eggs are released and normally attached to a sheltered substrate, the female usually die shortly after, but octopuses and a few squids will look after their eggs afterwards. Others, like the Japanese flying squid, will spawn neutrally buoyant egg masses which will float at the interface between water layers of slightly different densities, or the female will swim around while carrying the eggs with her. Most species are semelparous (only reproduce once before dying), the only known exceptions are the vampire squid, the lesser Pacific striped octopus and the nautilus, which are iteroparous. In some species of cephalopods, egg clutches are anchored to substrates by a mucilaginous adhesive substance. These eggs are swelled with perivitelline fluid (PVF), a hypertonic fluid that prevents premature hatching. Fertilized egg clusters are neutrally buoyant depending on the depth that they were laid, but can also be found in substrates such as sand, a matrix of corals, or seaweed. Because these species do not provide parental care for their offspring, egg capsules can be injected with ink by the female in order to camouflage the embryos from predators.

==== Male–male competition ====
Most cephalopods engage in aggressive sex: a protein in the male capsule sheath stimulates this behavior. They also engage in male–male aggression, where larger males tend to win the interactions. When a female is near, the males charge one another continuously and flail their arms. If neither male backs away, the arms extend to the back, exposing the mouth, followed by the biting of arm tips. During mate competition males also participate in a technique called flushing. This technique is used by the second male attempting to mate with a female. Flushing removes spermatophores in the buccal cavity that was placed there by the first mate by forcing water into the cavity. Another behavior that males engage in is sneaker mating or mimicry – smaller males adjust their behavior to that of a female in order to reduce aggression. By using this technique, they are able to fertilize the eggs while the larger male is distracted by a different male. During this process, the sneaker males quickly insert drop-like sperm into the seminal receptacle.

==== Mate choice ====
Mate choice is seen in cuttlefish species, where females prefer some males over others, though characteristics of the preferred males are unknown. A hypothesis states that females reject males by olfactory cues rather than visual cues. Several cephalopod species are polyandrous – accepting and storing multiple male spermatophores, which has been identified by DNA fingerprinting. Females are no longer receptive to mating attempts when holding their eggs in their arms. Females can store sperm in two places (1) the buccal cavity where recently mated males place their spermatophores, and (2) the internal sperm-storage receptacles where sperm packages from previous males are stored. Spermatophore storage results in sperm competition; which states that the female controls which mate fertilizes the eggs. In order to reduce this sort of competition, males develop agonistic behaviors like mate guarding and flushing. The &quot;Hapalochlaena lunulata&quot;, or the blue-ringed octopus, readily mates with both males and females.

==== Sexual dimorphism ====
In a variety of marine organisms, it is seen that females are larger in size compared to the males in some closely related species. In some lineages, such as the blanket octopus, males become structurally smaller and smaller resembling a term, &quot;dwarfism&quot; dwarf males usually occurs at low densities. The blanket octopus male is an example of sexual-evolutionary dwarfism; females grow 10,000 to 40,000 times larger than the males and the sex ratio between males and females can be distinguished right after hatching of the eggs.

==== Embryology ====
Cephalopod eggs span a large range of sizes, from 1 to 30 mm in diameter. The fertilised ovum initially divides to produce a disc of germinal cells at one pole, with the yolk remaining at the opposite pole. The germinal disc grows to envelop and eventually absorb the yolk, forming the embryo. The tentacles and arms first appear at the hind part of the body, where the foot would be in other molluscs, and only later migrate towards the head.

The funnel of cephalopods develops on the top of their head, whereas the mouth develops on the opposite surface. The early embryological stages are reminiscent of ancestral gastropods and extant Monoplacophora.

The shells develop from the ectoderm as an organic framework which is subsequently mineralized. In &quot;Sepia&quot;, which has an internal shell, the ectoderm forms an invagination whose pore is sealed off before this organic framework is deposited.

==== Development ====
The length of time before hatching is highly variable; smaller eggs in warmer waters are the fastest to hatch, and newborns can emerge after as little as a few days. Larger eggs in colder waters can develop for over a year before hatching.

The process from spawning to hatching follows a similar trajectory in all species, the main variable being the amount of yolk available to the young and when it is absorbed by the embryo.

Unlike most other molluscs, cephalopods do not have a morphologically distinct larval stage. Instead, the juveniles are known as paralarvae. They quickly learn how to hunt, using encounters with prey to refine their strategies.

Growth in juveniles is usually allometric, whilst adult growth is isometric.

== Evolution ==

The traditional view of cephalopod evolution holds that they evolved in the Late Cambrian from a monoplacophoran-like ancestor with a curved, tapering shell, which was closely related to the gastropods (snails). The similarity of the early shelled cephalopod &quot;Plectronoceras&quot; to some gastropods was used in support of this view. The development of a siphuncle would have allowed the shells of these early forms to become gas-filled (thus buoyant) in order to support them and keep the shells upright while the animal crawled along the floor, and separated the true cephalopods from putative ancestors such as &quot;Knightoconus&quot;, which lacked a siphuncle. Neutral or positive buoyancy (i.e. the ability to float) would have come later, followed by swimming in the Plectronocerida and eventually jet propulsion in more derived cephalopods.

Possible early Cambrian remains have been found in the Avalon Peninsula, matching genetic data for a pre-Cambrian origin. However, this specimen is later shown that is a chimerical fossil.

In 2010, some researchers proposed that &quot;Nectocaris pteryx&quot; is the early cephalopod, which did not have a shell and appeared to possess jet propulsion in the manner of &quot;derived&quot; cephalopods, complicated the question of the order in which cephalopod features developed. However, most of other researchers do not agree that &quot;Nectocaris&quot; actually being a cephalopod or even mollusk.

Early cephalopods were likely predators near the top of the food chain. After the late Cambrian extinction led to the disappearance of many radiodonts, predatory niches became available for other animals. During the Ordovician period, the primitive cephalopods underwent pulses of diversification to become diverse and dominant in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic seas.

In the Early Palaeozoic, their range was far more restricted than today; they were mainly constrained to sublittoral regions of shallow shelves of the low latitudes, and usually occurred in association with thrombolites. A more pelagic habit was gradually adopted as the Ordovician progressed. Deep-water cephalopods, whilst rare, have been found in the Lower Ordovician – but only in high-latitude waters.
The mid-Ordovician saw the first cephalopods with septa strong enough to cope with the pressures associated with deeper water, and could inhabit depths greater than 100–200 m. The direction of shell coiling would prove to be crucial to the future success of the lineages; endogastric coiling would only permit large size to be attained with a straight shell, whereas exogastric coiling – initially rather rare – permitted the spirals familiar from the fossil record to develop, with their corresponding large size and diversity. (Endogastric means the shell is curved so as the ventral or lower side is longitudinally concave (abdomen in); exogastric means the shell is curved so as the ventral side is longitudinally convex (abdomen out) allowing the funnel to be pointed backward beneath the shell.)

The ancestors of coleoids (including most modern cephalopods) and the ancestors of the modern nautilus, had diverged by the Floian Age of the Early Ordovician Period, over 470 million years ago. The Bactritida, a Devonian–Triassic group of orthocones, are widely held to be paraphyletic without the coleoids and ammonoids, that is, the latter groups arose from within the Bactritida. An increase in the diversity of the coleoids and ammonoids is observed around the start of the Devonian period and corresponds with a profound increase in fish diversity. This could represent the origin of the two derived groups.

Unlike most modern cephalopods, most ancient varieties had protective shells. These shells at first were conical but later developed into curved nautiloid shapes seen in modern nautilus species.

Competitive pressure from fish is thought to have forced the shelled forms into deeper water, which provided an evolutionary pressure towards shell loss and gave rise to the modern coleoids, a change which led to greater metabolic costs associated with the loss of buoyancy, but which allowed them to recolonize shallow waters. However, some of the straight-shelled nautiloids evolved into belemnites. The loss of the shell may also have resulted from evolutionary pressure to increase maneuverability, resulting in a more fish-like habit.

There has been debate on the embryological origin of cephalopod appendages. Until the mid-20th century, the &quot;Arms as Head&quot; hypothesis was widely recognized. In this theory, the arms and tentacles of cephalopods look similar to the head appendages of gastropods, suggesting that they might be homologous structures. Cephalopod appendages surround the mouth, so logically they could be derived from embryonic head tissues. However, the &quot;Arms as Foot&quot; hypothesis, proposed by Adolf Naef in 1928, has increasingly been favoured; for example, fate mapping of limb buds in the chambered nautilus indicates that limb buds originate from &quot;foot&quot; embryonic tissues.

=== Genetics ===
The sequencing of a full cephalopod genome has remained challenging to researchers due to the length and repetition of their DNA. The characteristics of cephalopod genomes were initially hypothesized to be the result of entire genome duplications. Following the full sequencing of a California two-spot octopus, the genome showed similar patterns to other marine invertebrates with significant additions to the genome assumed to be unique to cephalopods. No evidence of full genome duplication was found.

Within the California two-spot octopus genome there are substantial replications of two gene families. Significantly, the expanded gene families were only previously known to exhibit replicative behaviour within vertebrates. The first gene family was identified as the protocadherins which are attributed to neuron development. Protocadherins function as cell adhesion molecules, essential for synaptic specificity. The mechanism for protocadherin gene family replication in vertebrates is attributed to complex splicing, or cutting and pasting, from a locus. Following the sequencing of the California two-spot octopus, researchers found that the protocadherin gene family in cephalopods has expanded in the genome due to tandem gene duplication. The different replication mechanisms for protocadherin genes indicate an independent evolution of protocadherin gene expansion in vertebrates and invertebrates. Analysis of individual cephalopod protocadherin genes indicate independent evolution between species of cephalopod. A species of shore squid &quot;Doryteuthis pealeii&quot; with expanded protocadherin gene families differ significantly from those of the California two-spot octopus suggesting gene expansion did not occur before speciation within cephalopods. Despite different mechanisms for gene expansion, the two-spot octopus protocadherin genes were more similar to vertebrates than squid, suggesting a convergent evolution mechanism. The second gene family known as are small proteins that function as zinc transcription factors. are understood to moderate DNA, RNA and protein functions within the cell.

The sequenced California two spot octopus genome also showed a significant presence of transposable elements as well as transposon expression. Although the role of transposable elements in marine vertebrates is still relatively unknown, significant expression of transposons in nervous system tissues have been observed. In a study conducted on vertebrates, the expression of transposons during development in the fruitfly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; activated genomic diversity between neurons. This diversity has been linked to increased memory and learning in mammals. The connection between transposons and increased neuron capability may provide insight into the observed intelligence, memory and function of cephalopods.

Using long-read sequencing, researchers have decoded the cephalopod genomes and discovered they have been churned and scrambled. The genes were compared to those of thousands of other species and while blocks of three or more genes co-occurred between squid and octopus, the blocks of genes were not found together in any other animals&#x27;. Many of the groupings were in the nervous tissue, suggesting the course they adapted their intelligence.

===Phylogeny===

The approximate consensus of extant cephalopod phylogeny, after Whalen &amp; Landman (2022), is shown in the cladogram. Mineralized taxa are in bold.
The internal phylogeny of the cephalopods is difficult to constrain; many molecular techniques have been adopted, but the results produced are conflicting. &quot;Nautilus&quot; tends to be considered an outgroup, with &quot;Vampyroteuthis&quot; forming an outgroup to other squid; however in one analysis the nautiloids, octopus and teuthids plot as a polytomy. Some molecular phylogenies do not recover the mineralized coleoids (&quot;Spirula&quot;, &quot;Sepia&quot;, and &quot;Metasepia&quot;) as a clade; however, others do recover this more parsimonious-seeming clade, with &quot;Spirula&quot; as a sister group to &quot;Sepia&quot; and &quot;Metasepia&quot; in a clade that had probably diverged before the end of the Triassic.

Molecular estimates for clade divergence vary. One &#x27;statistically robust&#x27; estimate has &quot;Nautilus&quot; diverging from &quot;Octopus&quot; at .

===Taxonomy===

The classification presented here, for recent cephalopods, follows largely from Current Classification of Recent Cephalopoda (May 2001), for fossil cephalopods takes from Arkell et al. 1957, Teichert and Moore 1964, Teichert 1988, and others. The three subclasses are traditional, corresponding to the three orders of cephalopods recognized by Bather.

Other classifications differ, primarily in how the various decapod orders are related, and whether they should be orders or families.

====Suprafamilial classification of the Treatise====
This is the older classification that combines those found in parts K and L of the &quot;Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology&quot;, which forms the basis for and is retained in large part by classifications that have come later.

Nautiloids in general (Teichert and Moore, 1964) sequence as given.

: Subclass † Endoceratoidea. Not used by Flower, e.g. Flower and Kummel 1950, interjocerids included in the Endocerida.
:: Order † Endocerida
:: Order † Intejocerida

: Subclass † Actinoceratoidea Not used by Flower, ibid
:: Order † Actinocerida

: Subclass Nautiloidea Nautiloidea in the restricted sense.
:: Order † Ellesmerocerida Plectronocerida subsequently split off as separate order.
:: Order † Orthocerida Includes orthocerids and pseudorthocerids
:: Order † Ascocerida
:: Order † Oncocerida
:: Order † Discosorida
:: Order † Tarphycerida
:: Order † Barrandeocerida A polyphyletic group now included in the Tarphycerida
:: Order Nautilida

: Subclass † Bactritoidea
:: Order † Bactritida

Paleozoic Ammonoidea (Miller, Furnish and Schindewolf, 1957)
:: Suborder † Anarcestina
:: Suborder † Clymeniina
:: Suborder † Goniatitina
:: Suborder † Prolecanitina

Mesozoic Ammonoidea (Arkel et al., 1957)
:: Suborder † Ceratitina
:: Suborder † Phylloceratina
:: Suborder † Lytoceratina
:: Suborder † Ammonitina

Subsequent revisions include the establishment of three Upper Cambrian orders, the Plectronocerida, Protactinocerida, and Yanhecerida; separation of the pseudorthocerids as the Pseudorthocerida, and elevating orthoceratid as the Subclass Orthoceratoidea.

==== Shevyrev classification ====
Shevyrev (2005) suggested a division into eight subclasses, mostly comprising the more diverse and numerous fossil forms, although this classification has been criticized as arbitrary, lacking evidence, and based on misinterpretations of other papers.

===Cladistic classification===

Another recent system divides all cephalopods into two clades. One includes nautilus and most fossil nautiloids. The other clade (Neocephalopoda or Angusteradulata) is closer to modern coleoids, and includes belemnoids, ammonoids, and many orthocerid families. There are also stem group cephalopods of the traditional Ellesmerocerida that belong to neither clade.

The coleoids, despite some doubts, appear from molecular data to be monophyletic.

==In culture==

Ancient seafaring people were aware of cephalopods, as evidenced by such artworks as a stone carving found in the archaeological recovery from Bronze Age Minoan Crete at Knossos (1900 – 1100 BC), which has a depiction of a fisherman carrying an octopus. The terrifyingly powerful Gorgon of Greek mythology may have been inspired by the octopus or squid, the octopus&#x27;s body representing the severed head of Medusa, the beak as the protruding tongue and fangs, and its tentacles as the snakes.
The kraken is a legendary sea monster of giant proportions said to dwell off the coasts of Norway and Greenland, usually portrayed in art as a giant cephalopod attacking ships. Linnaeus included it in the first edition of his 1735 &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. In a Hawaiian creation myth that says the present cosmos is the last of a series which arose in stages from the ruins of the previous universe, the octopus is the lone survivor of the previous, alien universe. The Akkorokamui is a gigantic tentacled monster from Ainu folklore.

A battle with an octopus plays a significant role in Victor Hugo&#x27;s book &quot;Travailleurs de la mer&quot; (&quot;Toilers of the Sea&quot;), relating to his time in exile on Guernsey. 
Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1966 short story collection &quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot;, and the 1983 &quot;James Bond&quot; film were partly inspired by Hugo&#x27;s book.

Japanese erotic art, &quot;shunga&quot;, includes ukiyo-e woodblock prints such as Katsushika Hokusai&#x27;s 1814 print &quot;Tako to ama&quot; (The Dream of the Fisherman&#x27;s Wife), in which an ama diver is sexually intertwined with a large and a small octopus. The print is a forerunner of tentacle erotica.

Its many arms that emanate from a common center means that the octopus is sometimes used to symbolize a powerful and manipulative organization.

<doc id="42728" wikidata="Q4533329" url="?curid=42728" title="Signal reflection">
<text>In telecommunications, signal reflection occurs when a signal is transmitted along a transmission medium, such as a copper cable or an optical fiber. Some of the signal power may be reflected back to its origin rather than being carried all the way along the cable to the far end. This happens because imperfections in the cable cause impedance mismatches and non-linear changes in the cable characteristics. These abrupt changes in characteristics cause some of the transmitted signal to be reflected. In radio frequency (RF) practice this is often measured in a dimensionless ratio known as voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) with a VSWR bridge. The ratio of energy bounced back depends on the impedance mismatch. Mathematically, it is defined using the reflection coefficient.

Because the principles are the same, this concept is perhaps easiest to understand when considering an optical fiber. Imperfections in the glass create mirrors that reflect the light back along the fiber.

Impedance discontinuities cause attenuation, attenuation distortion, standing waves, ringing and other effects because a portion of a transmitted signal will be reflected back to the transmitting device rather than continuing to the receiver, much like an echo. This effect is compounded if multiple discontinuities cause additional portions of the remaining signal to be reflected back to the transmitter. This is a fundamental problem with the daisy chain method of connecting electronic components. 

When a returning reflection strikes another discontinuity, some of the signal rebounds in the original signal direction, creating multiple echo effects. These forward echoes strike the receiver at different intervals making it difficult for the receiver to accurately detect data values on the signal. The effects can resemble those of jitter.
Because damage to the cable can cause reflections, an instrument called an electrical time-domain reflectometer (ETDR; for electrical cables) or an optical time-domain reflectometer (OTDR; for optical cables) can be used to locate the damaged part of a cable. These instruments work by sending a short pulsed signal into the cable and measuring how long the reflection takes to return. If only reflection magnitudes are desired, however, and exact fault locations are not required, VSWR bridges perform a similar but lesser function for RF cables.

The combination of the effects of signal attenuation and impedance discontinuities on a communications link is called insertion loss. Proper network operation depends on constant characteristic impedance in all cables and connectors, with no impedance discontinuities in the entire cable system. When a sufficient degree of impedance matching is not practical, echo suppressors or echo cancellers, or both, can sometimes reduce the problems.

The Bergeron diagram method, valid for both linear and non-linear models, evaluates the reflection&#x27;s effects in an electric line.

==History==
===Nineteenth century===

Emory College was founded in 1836 in Oxford, Georgia, by the Methodist Episcopal Church. The college was named in honor of the departed Methodist bishop John Emory. Ignatius Alphonso Few was the college&#x27;s first president. In 1854, the Atlanta Medical College, a forerunner of Emory University School of Medicine, was founded. On April 12, 1861, the American Civil War began. Emory College was closed in November 1861 and all of its students enlisted on the Confederate side. In late 1863 the war came to Georgia and the college was used as hospital and later a headquarters for the Union Army. The university produced many officers who served in the war, including General George Thomas Anderson (1846C) who fought in nearly every major battle in the eastern theater. Thirty-five Emory students lost their lives and much of the campus was destroyed during the war.

Emory College, as with the entire Southeastern United States, struggled to overcome financial devastation during the Reconstruction Era. In 1880, Atticus Greene Haygood, Emory College President, delivered a speech expressing gratitude for the end of slavery in the United States, which captured the attention of George I. Seney, a New York banker. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment. In the 1880s, the technology department was launched by Isaac Stiles Hopkins, a polymath professor at Emory College. Hopkins became the first president of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1888. Emory University&#x27;s first international student, Yun Chi-ho, graduated in 1893. Yun became an important political activist in Korea and is the author of &quot;Aegukga&quot;, the national anthem of the Republic of Korea.

===Twentieth century===

On August 16, 1906, the Wesley Memorial Hospital and Training School for Nurses, later renamed the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, was established. In 1914, the Candler School of Theology was established. In 1915, Emory College relocated to Druid Hills and was rechartered as Emory University after accepting a land grant from Asa Griggs Candler, founder of The Coca-Cola Company and brother of commissioned chair Warren Akin Candler Based on large donations from the Candler, Woodruff, and Goizueta families, Emory University is colloquially referred to as &quot;Coca-Cola University&quot;. Emory University School of Law was established in 1916. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Emory University established its reputation as a regional institution that offered a solid education in medicine, law, theology, business, and the liberal arts.

==== First and Second World Wars ====
In 1917, the United States joined the First World War, and Emory University responded by organizing a medical unit composed of faculty and alumni of the medical school. The unit, which became known as Emory Unit, Base Hospital 43, served in Loir-et-Cher, France, from July 1918 to January 1919. During the Second World War, the Emory Unit was mobilized once again and served in the North African campaign and Europe. Emory&#x27;s contributions to the war effort were recognized by christening a ship, M.S. Emory Victory, which served during World War II and the Korean War.

In the 1940s, Emory University students, alumni, and faculty served in the Asia-Pacific War and European theater of World War II. Lieutenant Commander James L. Starnes, a graduate of Emory Law, was the navigator of the battleship and served as officer of the deck during the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. Bobby Jones, the golfer, served during the Battle of Normandy. Alfred A. Weinstein, a professor of surgery at Emory University School of Medicine, was a prisoner of war of the Empire of Japan between 1942 and 1945. His memoir, &quot;Barbed Wire Surgeon&quot;, is considered one of the finest accounts concerning allied prisoners under Japanese captivity and highlights the abuses of the war criminal Mutsuhiro Watanabe. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who graduated from the Candler School of Theology in 1940 and is portrayed in John Hersey&#x27;s &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, was able to organize the Hiroshima Maidens reconstructive surgery program based on the associations he made while studying in the United States. Tatsumasa Shirakawa, a Japanese student at the Candler School of Theology, was placed under arrest temporarily until Dean Henry Burton Trimble negotiated his release. Emory helped the nation prepare for war by participating in the V-12 Navy College Training Program and Army Specialized Training Program, programs designed to supplement the force of commissioned officers in the United States Navy and United States Army. The Candler School of Theology trained men for military chaplaincy. During the war, university enrollment boasted two military students for every one civilian. Emory University alumni would go on to serve in the Korean War, Second Indochina War (Vietnam War), Persian Gulf War, Yugoslav Wars, and the Global War on Terrorism.

=== Women&#x27;s and civil rights movements ===
The women&#x27;s movement and civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States profoundly shaped the future of Emory University. Formerly an all-male school, Emory officially became a coeducational institution in 1953. Although it had previously admitted women under limited circumstances, the university had never before had a policy through which they could enroll in large numbers and as resident students. In 1959, sororities first appeared on campus. In 1962, in the midst of the civil rights movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Previously, Georgia law denied tax-exempt status to private universities with racially integrated student bodies. The Supreme Court of Georgia ruled in Emory&#x27;s favor and Emory officially became racially integrated. Marvin S. Arrington Sr. was Emory University&#x27;s first, full-time African American student and graduated from Emory University School of Law in 1967.

In 1971, Emory established one of the nation&#x27;s first African-American studies programs and the first of its kind in the Southeastern United States. Emory&#x27;s diversity and academic reputation continued to flourish under the leadership of the university&#x27;s fifth president, James T. Laney. In addition to leading universities in the Southeastern United States in the promotion of racial equality, Laney and many of the school&#x27;s faculty and administrators were outspoken advocates of global human rights and thus were openly opposed to the military dictatorship in South Korea (1961–1987). On March 30, 1983, Laney&#x27;s friend Kim Dae-jung, while in political exile in the United States, presented a speech on human rights and democracy at Emory University and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Kim would go on to play a major role in ending authoritarianism in South Korea, served as the eighth President of South Korea from 1998 to 2003, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his successful implementation of the Sunshine Policy. Laney would later serve as United States Ambassador to South Korea and Emory graduate school, founded in 1919, was named in his honor in 2009.

In 2005, the university presented the President Medal, a rare award conferred only on individuals whose impact on the world has enhanced the dominion of peace or has enlarged the range of cultural achievement, to Civil Rights Movement activist Rosa Parks. The award is one of the highest honors presented by Emory.

In 2014, at Emory&#x27;s 169th Commencement, John Lewis, the only living &quot;Big Six&quot; leader of the civil rights movement, delivered the keynote address and received an honorary doctor of laws degree. In 2015, Emory University School of Law received a $1.5 million donation to help establish a John Lewis Chair in Civil Rights and Social Justice. The gift, given anonymously, funds a professorship which will enable Emory Law to conduct a national search for a scholar with an established academic profile of distinction and a demonstrated desire to promote the rule of law through the study of civil rights. The law school has committed to raise an additional $500,000 to fund the chair fully.

===Expansion and modernization===
In November 1979, Emory University experienced a historical shift when Robert Winship Woodruff and George Waldo Woodruff donated $105 million worth of Coca-Cola stock to the institution. At that time, this was the largest single gift ever made to any institution of higher education in the United States.

===Twenty-first century===

The latest additions to the Atlanta Campus include buildings for cancer research, biomedical research, scientific computation, mathematics and science, vaccine research, and the performing arts.

Prior to 2018, the campus was in an unincorporated area, statistically counted in the Druid Hills census-designated place. In 2016 the university stated that it intended to petition to be annexed into the City of Atlanta; in 2017 the university leadership formally submitted its petition. The City of Atlanta annexed Emory&#x27;s campus effective January 1, 2018, a part of its largest annexation within a period of 65 years; the Atlanta City Council voted to do so the prior December.

Gregory L. Fenves, formerly the president of the University of Texas at Austin, became Emory University&#x27;s 21st president in August 2020.

The Israel–Hamas war sparked demonstrations around the U.S., including at Emory. On April 25, 2024, during a pro-Palestinian protest, immediately subsequent to each objecting to the police presence, police detained both philosophy chair Noëlle McAfee and arrested economics professor Caroline Fohlin, who was later charged with battery, following her battering by police. The College of Arts and Science adopted a motion the following day for a college faculty no-confidence vote for Greg Fenves, president of the university, with an electronic vote organized for the following week.

==== Controversies ====
In 2012, Emory University underwent an internal investigation led by Emory Provost Earl Lewis and Jones Day Law Firm, revealing deliberate falsification of information by members of Emory University&#x27;s Office of Admission and Institutional Research. These individuals intentionally misreported data concerning entering students&#x27; standardized test scores and class rankings between 2000 and 2012 to standard reference sources and third parties who rank colleges and universities. The falsified data aimed to boost the university&#x27;s rankings. For example, while the office reported an 89% graduation rate within the top 10% of the class, the actual figure stood at only 75%. Consequently, following the investigation, the individuals responsible either resigned or were terminated, and the university issued a public apology to address the misconduct. To prevent future inaccuracies in data collection and reporting, Emory University took corrective actions in 2012 and 2013. These measures included the employment of independent data advisers to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the university&#x27;s data management processes.

==Campuses==

Emory University&#x27;s original campus was established in Oxford, Georgia, in 1836. The campus, located east of Emory&#x27;s Atlanta Campus, is home to Oxford College of Emory University and was the site of military headquarters and infirmaries during the American Civil War. Many of the buildings were designed with Neoclassical architecture and Gothic Revival architecture. In 1975, the United States National Register of Historic Places designated the campus as part of the Oxford Historic District.

Emory&#x27;s Atlanta Campus, established in the early twentieth century on a Beaux-Arts master plan by Pittsburgh architect Henry Hornbostel, covers more than in Atlanta&#x27;s historic neighborhood of Druid Hills. The university campus is heavily forested with pine, maples, oak, and magnolias, and Peavine Creek, a branch of the Peachtree Creek, runs through the campus. The Arbor Day Foundation named Emory a Tree Campus USA school in 2015. Many of the university&#x27;s buildings are designed with multi-hued granite and Spanish Saltillo tile. The university has one of the largest inventories by square footage of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-certified building space among campuses in the United States.
The campus is home to Emory University Hospital, Michael C. Carlos Museum, which has the largest collection of ancient artifacts in the Southeastern United States, the Winship Cancer Institute, Georgia&#x27;s first and only cancer center designated by the National Cancer Institute, the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, one of eight National Institutes of Health-funded national primate research centers, and a number of other academic, art, medical, and student facilitates. In 1991, Emory opened the first collegiate LGBT student center in the Southeastern United States which is the tenth oldest in the nation. Undergraduate dormitories include the Woodruff Residential Center, Clairmont Residential Center, Clifton Tower Apartments, Alabama Hall, Complex, Dobbs Hall, Harris Hall, Hamilton Hall, Eagle Hall, Raoul Hall and Turman Hall. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Cancer Society, Children&#x27;s Healthcare of Atlanta Egleston hospital, and Emory Point are located adjacent to the campus.

In 2015, a $52 million expansion and renovation project of the Sanford S. Atwood Chemistry Center was completed. The new, complex contains laboratories, interactive teaching and study spaces, and a chemistry library. The completion of the complex was accompanied by a $1.2 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to advance and modernize the university&#x27;s chemistry curriculum.

In the Candler Library Annex of Robert W. Woodruff Library, there is a 1920s Pietro Caproni reproduction of Bertel Thorvaldsen&#x27;s &quot;The Triumph of Alexander&quot; frieze. The frieze depicts Alexander the Great and his army entering Babylon following their victory over the Achaemenid Empire in the Battle of Gaugamela.

During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, the university hosted the United States Olympic women&#x27;s gymnastics team on its Atlanta Campus. The team, known as the Magnificent Seven, won the first-ever gold medal for the United States in the women&#x27;s team all-around competition. The university housed international officials and journalists and served as a training facility for Olympians. The Cox Hall Ballroom was transformed into a news center for the Olympic foreign press.

In February 2017, Emory announced that its R. Howard Dobbs University Center, built in 1986 from a neofuturistic postmodernist design by local architect John C. Portman Jr., to house the university&#x27;s main student/faculty center and dining hall (Coca-Cola Commons), would be demolished and replaced with a new $98 million Campus Life Center, designed by Durham, North Carolina–based Duda Paine Architects. Reasons given for the replacement included inconvenience of food delivery to the dining hall, undersized kitchen facilities, and inadequate fenestration in the Commons. The Emory Student Center (ESC), opened in May 2019 includes a dining hall, study and collaboration spaces, game room, a 1,400-plus-person multipurpose space, coffee shop, and food emporium. It is the first building on Emory&#x27;s campus to receive a LEED platinum rating.

<text>Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a form of silent meditation developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The TM technique involves the silent repetition of a &quot;mantra&quot; or sound, and is practiced for 15–20 minutes twice per day. It is taught by certified teachers through a standard course of instruction, with a cost which varies by country and individual circumstance. According to the TM organization, it is a non-religious method that promotes relaxed awareness, stress relief, self-development, and higher states of consciousness. The technique has been variously described as both religious and non-religious.

Maharishi began teaching the technique in India in the mid-1950s. Building on the teachings of his master, the Hindu Advaita monk Brahmananda Saraswati (known honorifically as Guru Dev), the Maharishi taught thousands of people during a series of world tours from 1958 to 1965, expressing his teachings in spiritual and religious terms. TM became more popular in the 1960s and 1970s as the Maharishi shifted to a more secular presentation, and his meditation technique was practiced by celebrities, most prominently members of the Beatles and the Beach Boys. At this time, he began training TM teachers. The worldwide TM organization had grown to include educational programs, health products, and related services. Following the Maharishi&#x27;s death in 2008, leadership of the TM organization passed to neuroscientist Tony Nader.

Research on TM began in the 1970s. A 2012 meta-analysis of the psychological impact of meditation found that Transcendental Meditation had a comparable effect on general wellbeing as other meditation techniques. A 2017 overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicates TM practice may lower blood pressure, an effect comparable with other health interventions. Because of a potential for bias and conflicting findings, more research is needed.

==History==
The Transcendental Meditation program and the Transcendental Meditation movement originated with their founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and continued beyond his death in 2008. In 1955, &quot;the Maharishi began publicly teaching a traditional meditation technique&quot; learned from his master Brahmananda Saraswati that he called Transcendental Deep Meditation and later renamed Transcendental Meditation.
The Maharishi initiated thousands of people, then developed a TM teacher training program as a way to accelerate the rate of bringing the technique to more people. He also inaugurated a series of tours that started in India in 1955 and went international in 1958 which promoted Transcendental Meditation. These factors, coupled with endorsements by celebrities who practiced TM and claims that scientific research had validated the technique, helped to popularize TM in the 1960s and 1970s. By the late 2000s, TM had been taught to millions of individuals and the Maharishi was overseeing a large multinational movement. Despite organizational changes and the addition of advanced meditative techniques in the 1970s, the Transcendental Meditation technique has remained relatively unchanged.

Among the first organizations to promote TM were the Spiritual Regeneration Movement and the International Meditation Society. In modern times, the movement has grown to encompass schools and universities that teach the practice, and includes many associated programs based on the Maharishi&#x27;s interpretation of the Vedic traditions. In the U.S., non-profit organizations included the Students International Meditation Society, AFSCI, World Plan Executive Council, Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation, Global Country of World Peace, Transcendental Meditation for Women, and Maharishi Foundation. The successor to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and leader of the Global Country of World Peace, is Tony Nader.

==Technique==

The meditation practice involves the use of a silently-used mantra for 15–20 minutes twice per day while sitting with the eyes closed. It is reported to be one of the most widely practiced, and among the most widely researched, meditation techniques, with hundreds of published research studies. The technique is made available worldwide by certified TM teachers in a seven-step course, and fees vary from country to country. Beginning in 1965, the Transcendental Meditation technique has been incorporated into selected schools, universities, corporations, and prison programs in the US, Latin America, Europe, and India. In 1977, a US district court ruled that a curriculum in TM and the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) being taught in some New Jersey schools was religious in nature and in violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The technique has since been included in a number of educational and social programs around the world.

The Transcendental Meditation technique has been described as both religious and non-religious, as an aspect of a new religious movement, as rooted in Hinduism, and as a non-religious practice for self-development.

The public presentation of the TM technique over its 50-year history has been praised for its high visibility in the mass media and effective global propagation, and criticized for using celebrity and scientific endorsements as a marketing tool. Also, advanced courses supplement the TM technique and include an advanced meditation program called the TM-Sidhi program, the unveiling of which created media controversy and a time of crisis for the movement’s image. In 2014, a meta-analysis of research found insufficient evidence that meditation such as TM &quot;had an effect on any of the psychological stress and well-being outcomes&quot;.

==Movement==

The Transcendental Meditation movement consists of the programs and organizations connected with the Transcendental Meditation technique and founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Transcendental Meditation was first taught in the 1950s in India and has continued since the Maharishi&#x27;s death in 2008. The organization was estimated to have 900,000 participants worldwide in 1977, a million by the 1980s, and 5 million in more recent years.

Programs include the Transcendental Meditation technique, an advanced meditation practice called the TM-Sidhi program (&quot;Yogic Flying&quot;), an alternative health care program called Maharishi Ayurveda, and a system of building and architecture called Maharishi Sthapatya Ved. The TM movement&#x27;s past and present media endeavors include a publishing company (MUM Press), a television station (KSCI), a radio station (KHOE), and a satellite television channel (Maharishi Channel). During its 50-year history, its products and services have been offered through a variety of organizations, which are primarily nonprofit and educational. These include the Spiritual Regeneration Movement, the International Meditation Society, World Plan Executive Council, Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation, Transcendental Meditation for Women, the Global Country of World Peace, and the David Lynch Foundation.

The TM movement also operates a worldwide network of Transcendental Meditation teaching centers, schools, universities, health centers, herbal supplements, solar panel, and home financing companies, plus several TM-centered communities. The global organization is reported to have an estimated net worth of USD 3.5 billion. The TM movement has been characterized in a variety of ways and has been called a spiritual movement, a new religious movement, a millenarian movement, a world affirming movement, a new social movement, a guru-centered movement, a personal growth movement, a religion, and a cult. Additional sources contend that TM and its movement are not a cult. Participants in TM programs are not required to adopt a belief system; it is practiced by atheists, agnostics and people from a variety of religious affiliations. 
The organization has been the subject of controversies that includes being labelled a cult by several parliamentary inquiries or anti-cult movements in the world.

Some notable figures in pop-culture practicing TM include the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Kendall Jenner, Hugh Jackman, Tom Hanks, Jennifer Lopez, Mick Jagger, Eva Mendez, Moby, David Lynch, Jennifer Aniston, Nicole Kidman, Eric André, Jerry Seinfeld, Howard Stern, Julia Fox, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, Russell Brand, Nick Cave and Oprah Winfrey.

==Health effects==

The first studies of the health effects of Transcendental Meditation appeared in the early 1970s.

There is no good evidence that TM reduces anxiety, or has any beneficial effect on forms of psychological stress or well-being.

A 2012 review found that Transcendental Meditation performed no better overall than other meditation techniques. The authors&#x27; analysis of a subset of these studies, those that studied specific categories of outcome, found that TM might perform better in reducing negative emotions, trait anxiety, and neuroticism and improving markers of learning, memory, and self-actualization, but performs more poorly in reducing negative personality traits, reducing stress, improving attention and mindfulness and cognition, in comparison with other meditation approaches.

A statement from the American Heart Association said that TM could be considered as a treatment for hypertension, although other interventions such as exercise and device-guided breathing were more effective and better supported by clinical evidence.

TM may reduce blood pressure according to a review that compared TM to control groups. A trend over time indicates practicing TM may lower blood pressure. Such effects are comparable to other lifestyle interventions. Conflicting findings across reviews and a potential risk of bias indicated the necessity of further evidence, conducted by researchers without bias. 
By 2004, the US government had given more than $20 million to Maharishi International University to study the effect of meditation on health.

==Views and claims==

===Views on consciousness (1963)===
In his 1963 book, &quot;The Science of Being and Art of Living,&quot; Maharishi Mahesh Yogi says that, over time, through the practice of the TM technique, the conscious mind gains familiarity with deeper levels of the mind, bringing the subconscious mind within the capacity of the conscious mind, resulting in expanded awareness in daily activity. He also teaches that the Transcendental Meditation practitioner transcends all mental activity and experiences the &#x27;source of thought&#x27;, which is said to be pure silence, &#x27;pure awareness&#x27; or &#x27;transcendental Being&#x27;, &#x27;the ultimate reality of life&#x27;. TM is sometimes self described as a technology of consciousness. According to author Michael Phelan, &quot;The fundamental premise of the psychology of fulfillment is that within every person exists a seemingly inexhaustible center of energy, intelligence, and satisfaction... To the extent that our behavior depends on the degree of energy and intelligence available to us, this center of pure creative intelligence may be described as that resource which gives direction to all that we experience, think and do.&quot;

According to the Maharishi, there are seven levels of consciousness: (i) deep sleep; (ii) dreaming; (iii) waking; (iv) transcendental consciousness; (v) cosmic consciousness; (vi) God consciousness; and, (vii) unity consciousness. The Maharishi says that transcendental consciousness can be experienced through Transcendental Meditation, and that those who meditate regularly over time could become aware of cosmic consciousness. An indication of cosmic consciousness is &quot;ever present wakefulness&quot; present even during sleep. Research on long-term TM practitioners experiencing what they describe as cosmic consciousness, has identified unique EEG profiles, muscle tone measurements, and REM indicators that suggest physiological parameters for this self described state of consciousness. However, the Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness notes that it is premature to say that the EEG coherence found in TM is an indication of a higher state of consciousness.

===Science of Creative Intelligence (1971)===
In 1961, the Maharishi created the &quot;International Meditation Society for the Science of Creative Intelligence&quot;. In 1971 the Maharishi inaugurated &quot;Maharishi&#x27;s Year of Science of Creative Intelligence&quot; and described SCI as the connection of &quot;modern science with ancient Vedic science&quot;. Author Philip Goldberg describes it as Vedanta philosophy that has been translated into scientific language. A series of international symposiums on the Science of Creative Intelligence were held between 1970 and 1973 and were attended by scientists and &quot;leading thinkers&quot;, including Buckminster Fuller, Melvin Calvin, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, Hans Selye, Marshal McLuhan and Jonas Salk. These symposiums were held at universities such as Humboldt State University and University of Massachusetts. The following year, the Maharishi developed a World Plan to spread his teaching of SCI around the world.

The theoretical part of SCI is taught in a 33-lesson video course. In the early 1970s, the SCI course was offered at more than 25 American universities including Stanford University, Yale University, the University of Colorado, the University of Wisconsin, and Oregon State University. Until 2009, Maharishi University of Management (MUM) required its undergraduate students to take SCI classes, and both MUM and Maharishi European Research University (MERU) in Switzerland have awarded degrees in the field. &quot;The Independent&quot; reports that children at Maharishi School learn SCI principles such as &quot;the nature of life is to grow&quot; and &quot;order is present everywhere&quot;. SCI is reported to be part of the curriculum of TM related lower schools in Iowa, Wheaton, Maryland and Skelmersdale, UK. In 1975 SCI was used as the call letters for a TM owned television station in San Bernardino, California.

The Science of Creative Intelligence is not science. Theologian Robert M. Price, writing in the &quot;Creation/Evolution Journal&quot; (the journal of the National Center for Science Education), compares the Science of Creative Intelligence to Creationism. Price says instruction in the Transcendental Meditation technique is &quot;never offered without indoctrination into the metaphysics of &#x27;creative intelligence. Skeptic James Randi says SCI has &quot;no scientific characteristics.&quot; Astrophysicist and sceptic Carl Sagan writes that the &quot;Hindu doctrine&quot; of TM is a pseudoscience. Irving Hexham, a professor of religious studies, describes the TM teachings as &quot;pseudoscientific language that masks its religious nature by mythologizing science&quot;. Sociologists Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge describe the SCI videotapes as largely based on the Bhagavad Gita, and say that they are &quot;laced with parables and metaphysical postulates, rather than anything that can be recognized as conventional science&quot;. In 1979, the court case &quot;Malnak v Yogi&quot; determined that although SCI/TM is not a theistic religion, it deals with issues of ultimate concern, truth, and other ideas analogous to those in well-recognized religions. Maharishi biographer Paul Mason suggests that the scientific terminology used in SCI was developed by the Maharishi as part of a restructuring of his philosophies in terms that would gain greater acceptance and increase the number of people starting the TM technique. He says that this change toward a more academic language was welcomed by many of the Maharishi&#x27;s American students.

===Maharishi effect (1974)===
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi claimed that the quality of life would noticeably improve if at least the square root of one per cent (1%) of the population practised the Transcendental Meditation technique. This is known as the &quot;Maharishi effect&quot; and according to the Maharishi, it was perceived in 1974 after an analysis of crime statistics in 16 cities. With the introduction of the TM-Sidhi program including Yogic Flying, the Maharishi proposed that the square root of 1 per cent of the population (around 6325 people, the square root of 40 million (1% of the global
population of about 4 billion people in 1974)) practicing this advanced program together at the same time and in the same place would create benefits in society. This was referred to as the &quot;Extended Maharishi Effect&quot;.

Author Ted Karam claims that there have been numerous studies on the Maharishi effect including a gathering of over 4,000 people (just under two thirds of the square root of 1% of the population as of 1974) in Washington, D.C. in the summer of 1993. The effect has been examined in 42 scientific studies. The TM organisation has linked the fall of the Berlin Wall and a reduction in global terrorism, US inflation and crime rates to the Maharishi effect. The Maharishi effect has been endorsed by the former President of Mozambique Joaquim Chissano.

As the theories proposed by TM practitioners are not scientific, the Maharishi effect still lacks a causal basis. Moreover, the evidence has been said to result from cherry-picked data and the credulity of believers. Critics, such as James Randi, have called this research pseudoscience. Randi says that he investigated comments made by former Maharishi International University faculty member Robert Rabinoff in 1978. He spoke to the Fairfield Chief of Police who said local crime levels were the same and the regional Agriculture Department who reportedly deemed that farm yields for Jefferson County matched the state average.

===Maharishi Vedic Science (1981)===
The Maharishi proclaimed 1981 as the Year of Vedic Science. It is based on the Maharishi&#x27;s interpretation of ancient Vedic texts and includes subjective technologies like the Transcendental Meditation technique and the TM-Sidhi program plus programs like Maharishi Sthapatya Veda (MSV) and Maharishi Vedic Astrology (MVA) services which apply Vedic science to day-to-day living. Vedic science studies the various aspects of life and their relationship to the Veda.

===Maharishi Ayurveda===

Maharishi Ayurveda or Maharishi Vedic Medicine is a form of alternative medicine founded in the mid-1980s by Maharishi. Distinct from traditional ayurveda, it emphasizes the role of consciousness, and gives importance to positive emotions. Maharishi Ayurveda has been variously characterized as emerging from, and consistently reflecting, the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, representing the entirety of the ayurvedic tradition.

<text>The United East India Company ( ; VOC ), commonly known as the Dutch East India Company, was a chartered trading company and one of the first joint-stock companies in the world. Established on 20 March 1602 by the States General of the Netherlands amalgamating existing companies, it was granted a 21-year monopoly to carry out trade activities in Asia. Shares in the company could be purchased by any citizen of the Dutch Republic and subsequently bought and sold in open-air secondary markets (one of which became the Amsterdam Stock Exchange). The company possessed quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, strike its own coins, and establish colonies. Also, because it traded across multiple colonies and countries from both the East and the West, the VOC is sometimes considered to have been the world&#x27;s first multinational corporation.

Statistically, the VOC eclipsed all of its rivals in the Asian trade. Between 1602 and 1796, the VOC sent nearly a million Europeans to work in the Asia trade on 4,785 ships and netted for their efforts more than 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods and slaves. By contrast, the rest of Europe combined sent only 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795, and the fleet of the English (later British) East India Company, the VOC&#x27;s nearest competitor, was a distant second to its total traffic with 2,690 ships and a mere one-fifth the tonnage of goods carried by the VOC. The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly and slave trading activities through most of the 17th century.

Having been set up in 1602 to profit from the Malukan spice trade, the VOC established a capital in the port city of Jayakarta in 1619 and changed its name to Batavia (now Jakarta). Over the next two centuries the company acquired additional ports as trading bases and safeguarded their interests by taking over surrounding territory. It remained an important trading concern and paid annual dividends that averaged to about 18% of the capital for almost 200 years. Much of the labor that built its colonies was from people it had enslaved.

Weighed down by smuggling, corruption and growing administrative costs in the late 18th century, the company went bankrupt and was formally dissolved in 1799. Its possessions and debt were taken over by the government of the Dutch Batavian Republic.

==Company name, logo, and flag==
In Dutch, the name of the company was the &quot;Vereenigde Nederlandsche Geoctroyeerde Oostindische Compagnie&quot; (abbreviated as the VOC), literally the &#x27;United Dutch Chartered East India Company&#x27; (the United East India Company). The company&#x27;s monogram logo consisted of a large capital &#x27;V&#x27; with an O on the left and a C on the right half and was possibly the first globally recognised corporate logo. It appeared on various corporate items, such as cannons and coins. The first letter of the hometown of the chamber conducting the operation was placed on top. The monogram&#x27;s versatility, flexibility, clarity, simplicity, symmetry, timelessness, and symbolism are considered notable characteristics of the VOC&#x27;s professionally designed logo. Those elements ensured its success at a time when the concept of the corporate identity was virtually unknown. An Australian vintner has used the VOC logo since the late 20th century, having re-registered the company&#x27;s name for the purpose.

Around the world, and especially in English-speaking countries, the VOC is widely known as the &#x27;Dutch East India Company&#x27;. The name &#x27;Dutch East India Company&#x27; is used to make a distinction from the [British] East India Company (EIC) and other East Indian companies (such as the Danish East India Company, French East India Company, Portuguese East India Company, and the Swedish East India Company). The company&#x27;s alternative names that have been used include the &#x27;Dutch East Indies Company&#x27;, &#x27;United East India Company&#x27;, &#x27;Jan Company&#x27;, or &#x27;Jan Compagnie&#x27;.

==History==
===Origins===

Before the Dutch Revolt, which began in 1566/68, the Flemish city of Antwerp had played an important role as a distribution center in northern Europe. After 1591, the Portuguese used an international syndicate of the German Fugger family and Welser family, as well as Spanish and Italian firms, which operated out of Hamburg as the northern staple port to distribute their goods, thereby cutting Dutch merchants out of the trade. At the same time, the Portuguese trade system was unable to increase supply to satisfy growing demand, in particular the demand for pepper. Demand for spices was relatively inelastic; therefore, each lag in the supply of pepper caused a sharp rise in pepper prices.

In 1580, the Portuguese crown was united in a personal union with the Spanish crown (known as the Iberian Union), with which the Dutch Republic was at war. The Portuguese Empire thus became an appropriate target for Dutch military incursions. These factors motivated Dutch merchants to enter the intercontinental spice trade themselves. Further, a number of Dutch merchants and explorers, such as Jan Huyghen van Linschoten and Cornelis de Houtman, went on to obtain firsthand knowledge of the &quot;secret&quot; Portuguese trade routes and practices that were already in place, thereby providing further opportunity for the Dutch to enter the trade.

The stage was thus set for Dutch expeditions to the Indonesian islands, beginning with James Lancaster in 1591, Cornelis de Houtman in 1595 and again in 1598, Jacob Van Neck in 1598, Lancaster again in 1601, among others. During the four-ship exploratory expedition by Frederick de Houtman in 1595 to Banten, the main pepper port of West Java, the crew clashed with both Portuguese and indigenous Javanese. Houtman&#x27;s expedition then sailed east along the north coast of Java, losing twelve crew members to a Javanese attack at Sidayu and killing a local ruler in Madura. Half the crew were lost before the expedition made it back to the Netherlands the following year, but with enough spices to make a considerable profit.

In 1598, an increasing number of fleets were sent out by competing merchant groups from around the Netherlands. Some fleets were lost, but most were successful, with some voyages producing high profits. In 1598, a fleet of eight ships under Jacob van Neck had been the first Dutch fleet to reach the &#x27;Spice Islands&#x27; of Maluku (also known as the Moluccas), cutting out the Javanese middlemen. The ships returned to Europe in 1599 and 1600 and the expedition made a 400 percent profit.

In 1600, the Dutch joined forces with the Muslim Hituese on Ambon Island in an anti-Portuguese alliance, in return for which the Dutch were given the sole right to purchase spices from Hitu. Dutch control of Ambon was achieved when the Portuguese surrendered their fort in Ambon to the Dutch-Hituese alliance. In 1613, the Dutch expelled the Portuguese from their Solor fort, but a subsequent Portuguese attack led to a second change of hands; following this second reoccupation, the Dutch once again captured Solor in 1636.

East of Solor, on the island of Timor, Dutch advances were halted by an autonomous and powerful group of Portuguese Eurasians called the Topasses. They remained in control of the Sandalwood trade and their resistance lasted throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, causing Portuguese Timor to remain under the Portuguese sphere of control.

===Formative years===


At the time, it was customary for a company to be funded only for the duration of a single voyage and to be liquidated upon the return of the fleet. Investment in these expeditions was a very high-risk venture, not only because of the usual dangers of piracy, disease and shipwreck, but also because the interplay of inelastic demand and relatively elastic supply of spices could make prices tumble, thereby ruining prospects of profitability. To manage such risk, the forming of a cartel to control supply would seem logical. In 1600, the English were the first to adopt this approach by bundling their resources into a monopoly enterprise, the English East India Company, thereby threatening their Dutch competitors with ruin.

In 1602, the Dutch government followed suit, sponsoring the creation of a single &quot;United East Indies Company&quot; that was also granted monopoly over the Asian trade. For a time in the seventeenth century, it was able to monopolise the trade in nutmeg, mace, and cloves and to sell these spices across European kingdoms and Emperor Akbar the Great&#x27;s Mughal Empire at 14–17 times the price it paid in Indonesia; While Dutch profits soared, the local economy of the Spice Islands was destroyed, because as a monopoly buyer, the VOC forced the prices paid to the local producers in the Spice Islands down to low levels. With a capital of 6,440,200 guilders, the new company&#x27;s charter empowered it to build forts, maintain armies, and conclude treaties with Asian rulers. It provided for a venture that would continue for 21 years, with a financial accounting only at the end of each decade.

In February 1603, the company seized the &quot;Santa Catarina&quot;, a 1500-ton Portuguese merchant carrack, off the coast of Singapore. She was such a rich prize that her sale proceeds increased the capital of the VOC by more than 50%.

Also in 1603, the first permanent Dutch trading post in Indonesia was established in Banten, West Java, and in 1611, another was established at Jayakarta (later &quot;Batavia&quot; and then &quot;Jakarta&quot;). In 1610, the VOC established the post of governor-general to more firmly control their affairs in Asia. To advise and control the risk of despotic governors-general, a Council of the Indies (&quot;Raad van Indië&quot;) was created. The governor-general effectively became the main administrator of the VOC&#x27;s activities in Asia, although the &quot;Heeren XVII&quot;, a body of 17 shareholders representing different chambers, continued to officially have overall control.

VOC headquarters were located in Ambon during the tenures of the first three governors-general (1610–1619), but it was not a satisfactory location. Although it was at the centre of the spice production areas, it was far from the Asian trade routes and other VOC areas of activity ranging from Africa to India to Japan. A location in the west of the archipelago was thus sought. The Straits of Malacca were strategic but became dangerous following the Portuguese conquest, and the first permanent VOC settlement in Banten was controlled by a powerful local ruler and subject to stiff competition from Chinese and English traders.

In 1604, a second English East India Company voyage commanded by Sir Henry Middleton reached the islands of Ternate, Tidore, Ambon and Banda. In Banda, they encountered severe VOC hostility, sparking Anglo-Dutch competition for access to spices. From 1611 to 1617, the English established trading posts at Sukadana (southwest Kalimantan), Makassar, Jayakarta and Jepara in Java, and Aceh, Pariaman and Jambi in Sumatra, which threatened Dutch ambitions for a monopoly on East Indies trade.

In 1620, diplomatic agreements in Europe ushered in a period of collaboration between the Dutch and English spice trades. This ended with the notorious Amboyna massacre, where ten Englishmen were arrested, tried and beheaded for conspiracy against the Dutch government. Although this caused outrage in Europe and a diplomatic crisis, the English quietly withdrew from most of their Indonesian activities (except trading in Banten) and focused on other Asian interests.

===Growth===

In 1619, Jan Pieterszoon Coen was appointed governor-general of the VOC. He saw the possibility of the VOC becoming an Asian power, both political and economic. On 30 May 1619, Coen, backed by a force of nineteen ships, stormed Jayakarta, driving out the Banten forces; and from the ashes established Batavia as the VOC headquarters. In the 1620s almost the entire native population of the Banda Islands was driven away, starved to death, or killed in an attempt to replace them with Dutch plantations. These plantations were used to grow nutmeg for export. Coen hoped to settle large numbers of Dutch colonists in the East Indies, but implementation of this policy never materialised, mainly because very few Dutch were willing to emigrate to Asia.

Another of Coen&#x27;s ventures was more successful. A major problem in the European trade with Asia at the time was that the Europeans could offer few goods that Asian consumers wanted, except silver and gold. European traders therefore had to pay for spices with the precious metals, which were in short supply in Europe, except for Spain and Portugal. The Dutch and English had to obtain it by creating a trade surplus with other European countries. Coen discovered the obvious solution for the problem: to start an intra-Asiatic trade system, whose profits could be used to finance the spice trade with Europe. In the long run this obviated the need for exports of precious metals from Europe, though at first it required the formation of a large trading-capital fund in the Indies. The VOC reinvested a large share of its profits to this end in the period up to 1630.

The VOC traded throughout Asia, benefiting mainly from Bengal. Ships coming into Batavia from the Netherlands carried supplies for VOC settlements in Asia. Silver and copper from Japan were used to trade with the world&#x27;s wealthiest empires, Mughal India and Qing China, for silk, cotton, porcelain, and textiles. These products were either traded within Asia for the coveted spices or brought back to Europe. The VOC was also instrumental in introducing European ideas and technology to Asia. The company supported Christian missionaries and traded modern technology with China and Japan. A more peaceful VOC trade post on Dejima, an artificial island off the coast of Nagasaki, was for more than two hundred years the only place where Europeans were permitted to trade with Japan. When the VOC tried to use military force to make Ming dynasty China open up to Dutch trade, the Chinese defeated the Dutch in a war over the Penghu islands from 1623 to 1624, forcing the VOC to abandon Penghu for Taiwan. The Chinese defeated the VOC again at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay in 1633.

The Vietnamese Nguyen lords defeated the VOC in a 1643 battle during the Trịnh–Nguyễn War, blowing up a Dutch ship. The Cambodians defeated the VOC in the Cambodian–Dutch War from 1643 to 1644 on the Mekong River.

In 1640, the VOC obtained the port of Galle, Ceylon, from the Portuguese and broke the latter&#x27;s monopoly of the cinnamon trade. In 1658, Gerard Pietersz Hulft laid siege to Colombo, which was captured with the help of King Rajasinghe II of Kandy. By 1659, the Portuguese had been expelled from the coastal regions, which were then occupied by the VOC, securing for it the monopoly over cinnamon.
To prevent the Portuguese or the English from ever recapturing Sri Lanka, the VOC went on to conquer the entire Malabar Coast from the Portuguese, almost entirely driving them from the west coast of India.

In 1652, Jan van Riebeeck established a resupply outpost at the Cape of Storms (the southwestern tip of Africa, now Cape Town, South Africa) to service company ships on their journey to and from East Asia. The cape was later renamed Cape of Good Hope in honour of the outpost&#x27;s presence. Although non-company ships were welcome to use the station, they were charged exorbitantly. This post later became a full-fledged colony, the Cape Colony, when more Dutch and other Europeans started to settle there.

Through the seventeenth century VOC trading posts were also established in Persia, Bengal, Malacca, Siam, Formosa (now Taiwan), as well as the Malabar and Coromandel coasts in India. Direct access to mainland China came in 1729 when a factory was established in Canton. In 1662, however, Koxinga expelled the Dutch from Taiwan (&quot;see&quot; History of Taiwan).

In 1663, the VOC signed the &quot;Painan Treaty&quot; with several local lords in the Painan area that were revolting against the Aceh Sultanate. The treaty allowed the VOC to build a trading post in the area and eventually to monopolise the trade there, especially the gold trade.

By 1669, the VOC was the richest private company the world had ever seen, with over 150 merchant ships, 40 warships, 50,000 employees, a private army of 10,000 soldiers, and a dividend payment of 40% on the original investment.

Many of the VOC employees inter-mixed with the indigenous peoples and expanded the population of Indos in pre-colonial history.

===Reorientation===
Around 1670, two events caused the growth of VOC trade to stall. In the first place, the highly profitable trade with Japan started to decline. The loss of the outpost on Formosa to Koxinga in the 1662 siege of Fort Zeelandia and related internal turmoil in China (where the Ming dynasty was being replaced with the China&#x27;s Qing dynasty) brought an end to the silk trade after 1666. Though the VOC substituted Mughal Bengal&#x27;s for Chinese silk, other forces affected the supply of Japanese silver and gold. The shogunate enacted a number of measures to limit the export of these precious metals, in the process limiting VOC opportunities for trade, and severely worsening the terms of trade. Therefore, Japan ceased to function as the linchpin of the intra-Asiatic trade of the VOC by 1685.

Even more importantly, the Third Anglo-Dutch War temporarily interrupted VOC trade with Europe. This caused a spike in the price of pepper, which enticed the English East India Company (EIC) to enter this market aggressively in the years after 1672. Previously, one of the tenets of the VOC pricing policy was to slightly over-supply the pepper market, so as to depress prices below the level where interlopers were encouraged to enter the market (instead of striving for short-term profit maximisation). The wisdom of such a policy was illustrated when a fierce price war with the EIC ensued, as that company flooded the market with new supplies from India. In this struggle for market share, the VOC (which had much larger financial resources) could wait out the EIC. Indeed, by 1683, the latter came close to bankruptcy; its share price plummeted from 600 to 250; and its president Josiah Child was temporarily forced from office.

However, the writing was on the wall. Other companies, like the French East India Company and the Danish East India Company also started to make inroads on the Dutch system. The VOC therefore closed the theretofore flourishing open pepper emporium of Bantam by a treaty of 1684 with the Sultan. Also, on the Coromandel Coast, it moved its chief stronghold from Pulicat to Nagapattinam, so as to secure a monopoly on the pepper trade to the detriment of the French and the Danes. However, the importance of these traditional commodities in the Asian-European trade was diminishing rapidly at the time. The military outlays that the VOC needed to make to enhance its monopoly were not justified by the increased profits of this declining trade.

Nevertheless, this lesson was slow to sink in and at first the VOC made the strategic decision to improve its military position on the Malabar Coast (hoping thereby to curtail English influence in the area, and end the drain on its resources from the cost of the Malabar garrisons) by using force to compel the Zamorin of Calicut to submit to Dutch domination. In 1710, the Zamorin was made to sign a treaty with the VOC undertaking to trade exclusively with the VOC and expel other European traders. For a brief time, this appeared to improve the company&#x27;s prospects. However, in 1715, with EIC encouragement, the Zamorin renounced the treaty. Though a Dutch army managed to suppress this insurrection temporarily, the Zamorin continued to trade with the English and the French, which led to an appreciable upsurge in English and French traffic. The VOC decided in 1721 that it was no longer worth the trouble to try to dominate the Malabar pepper and spice trade. A strategic decision was taken to scale down the Dutch military presence and in effect yield the area to EIC influence.

In the 1741 Battle of Colachel, warriors of Travancore under Raja Marthanda Varma defeated the Dutch. The Dutch commander Captain Eustachius De Lannoy was captured. Marthanda Varma agreed to spare the Dutch captain&#x27;s life on condition that he joined his army and trained his soldiers on modern lines. This defeat in the Travancore–Dutch War is considered the earliest example of an organised Asian power overcoming European military technology and tactics; and it signalled the decline of Dutch power in India.

The attempt to continue as before as a low volume-high profit business enterprise with its core business in the spice trade had therefore failed. The company had however already (reluctantly) followed the example of its European competitors in diversifying into other Asian commodities, like tea, coffee, cotton, textiles, and sugar. These commodities provided a lower profit margin and therefore required a larger sales volume to generate the same amount of revenue. This structural change in the commodity composition of the VOC&#x27;s trade started in the early 1680s, after the temporary collapse of the EIC around 1683 offered an excellent opportunity to enter these markets. The actual cause for the change lies, however, in two structural features of this new era.

In the first place, there was a revolutionary change in the tastes affecting European demand for Asian textiles, coffee and tea, around the turn of the 18th century. Secondly, a new era of an abundant supply of capital at low interest rates suddenly opened around this time. The second factor enabled the company easily to finance its expansion in the new areas of commerce. Between the 1680s and 1720s, the VOC was therefore able to equip and man an appreciable expansion of its fleet, and acquire a large amount of precious metals to finance the purchase of large amounts of Asian commodities, for shipment to Europe. The overall effect was approximately to double the size of the company.

The tonnage of the returning ships rose by 125 percent in this period. However, the company&#x27;s revenues from the sale of goods landed in Europe rose by only 78 percent. This reflects the basic change in the VOC&#x27;s circumstances that had occurred: it now operated in new markets for goods with an elastic demand, in which it had to compete on an equal footing with other suppliers. This made for low profit margins. The business information systems of the time made this difficult to discern for the managers of the company, which may partly explain the mistakes they made from hindsight. This lack of information might have been counteracted (as in earlier times in the VOC&#x27;s history) by the business acumen of the directors. By this time these were almost exclusively recruited from the political &quot;regent&quot; class, which had long since lost its close relationship with merchant circles.

Low profit margins in themselves do not explain the deterioration of revenues. To a large extent the costs of the operation of the VOC had a &quot;fixed&quot; character (military establishments; maintenance of the fleet and such). Profit levels might therefore have been maintained if the increase in the scale of trading operations that in fact took place had resulted in economies of scale. However, though larger ships transported the growing volume of goods, labour productivity did not go up sufficiently to realise these. In general the company&#x27;s overhead rose in step with the growth in trade volume; declining gross margins translated directly into a decline in profitability of the invested capital. The era of expansion was one of &quot;profitless growth&quot;.

Specifically: &quot;[t]he long-term average annual profit in the VOC&#x27;s 1630–70 &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; was 2.1 million guilders, of which just under half was distributed as dividends and the remainder reinvested. The long-term average annual profit in the &#x27;Expansion Age&#x27; (1680–1730) was 2.0 million guilders, of which three-quarters was distributed as dividend and one-quarter reinvested. In the earlier period, profits averaged 18 percent of total revenues; in the latter period, 10 percent. The annual return of invested capital in the earlier period stood at approximately 6 percent; in the latter period, 3.4 percent.&quot;

Nevertheless, in the eyes of investors the VOC did not do too badly. The share price hovered consistently around the 400 mark from the mid-1680s (excepting a hiccup around the Glorious Revolution in 1688), and they reached an all-time high of around 642 in the 1720s. VOC shares then yielded a return of 3.5 percent, only slightly less than the yield on Dutch government bonds.

===Decline and fall===

After 1730, the fortunes of the VOC started to decline. Five major contributing factors are attributed to its decay in the 50 years between 1730 and 1780:
* There was a steady erosion of intra-Asiatic trade because of changes in the Asiatic political and economic environment that the VOC could do little about. These factors gradually squeezed the company out of Persia, Suratte, the Malabar Coast, and Bengal. The company had to confine its operations to the belt it physically controlled, from Ceylon through the Indonesian archipelago. The volume of this intra-Asiatic trade, and its profitability, therefore had to shrink.
* The way the company was organised in Asia (centralised on its hub in Batavia), that initially had offered advantages in gathering market information, began to cause disadvantages in the 18th century because of the inefficiency of first shipping everything to this central point. This disadvantage was most keenly felt in the tea trade, where competitors like the EIC and the Ostend Company shipped directly from China to Europe.
* The &quot;venality&quot; of the VOC&#x27;s personnel (in the sense of corruption and non-performance of duties), though a problem for all East India Companies at the time, seems to have plagued the VOC on a larger scale than its competitors. To be sure, the company was not a &quot;good employer&quot;. Salaries were low, and &quot;private-account trading&quot; was officially not allowed. It proliferated in the 18th century to the detriment of the company&#x27;s performance. From about the 1790s onward, the phrase &quot;perished under corruption&quot; (&quot;vergaan onder corruptie&quot;, also abbreviated VOC in Dutch) came to summarise the company&#x27;s future.
* A problem that the VOC shared with other companies was the high mortality and morbidity rates among its employees. This decimated the company&#x27;s ranks and enervated many of the survivors.
* A further issue was caused by the VOC&#x27;s dividend policy. The dividends distributed by the company had exceeded the surplus it garnered in Europe in every decade from 1690 to 1760 except 1710–1720. However, in the period up to 1730 the directors shipped resources to Asia to build up the trading capital there. Consolidated bookkeeping therefore probably would have shown that total profits exceeded dividends. In addition, between 1700 and 1740 the company retired 5.4 million guilders of long-term debt. The company therefore was still on a secure financial footing in these years. This changed after 1730. While profits plummeted the &quot;bewindhebbers&quot; only slightly decreased dividends from the earlier level. Distributed dividends were therefore in excess of earnings in every decade but one (1760–1770). To accomplish this, the Asian capital stock had to be drawn down by 4 million guilders between 1730 and 1780, and the liquid capital available in Europe was reduced by 20 million guilders in the same period. The directors were therefore constrained to replenish the company&#x27;s liquidity by resorting to short-term financing from anticipatory loans, backed by expected revenues from home-bound fleets.
Despite these problems, the VOC in 1780 remained an enormous operation. Its capital in the Republic, consisting of ships and goods in inventory, totalled 28 million guilders; its capital in Asia, consisting of the liquid trading fund and goods en route to Europe, totalled 46 million guilders. Total capital, net of outstanding debt, stood at 62 million guilders. The prospects of the company at this time therefore were not hopeless, had one of the plans for reform been undertaken successfully. However, the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War intervened. British naval attacks in Europe and Asia reduced the VOC fleet by half; removed valuable cargo from its control; and eroded its remaining power in Asia. The direct losses of the VOC during the war can be calculated at 43 million guilders. Loans to keep the company operating reduced its net assets to zero.

From 1720 on, the market for sugar from Indonesia declined as the competition from cheap sugar from Brazil increased. European markets became saturated. Dozens of Chinese sugar traders went bankrupt, which led to massive unemployment, which in turn led to gangs of unemployed coolies. The Dutch government in Batavia did not adequately respond to these problems. In 1740, rumours of deportation of the gangs from the Batavia area led to widespread rioting. The Dutch military searched houses of Chinese in Batavia for weapons. When a house accidentally burnt down, military and impoverished citizens started slaughtering and pillaging the Chinese community. This massacre of the Chinese was deemed sufficiently serious for the board of the VOC to start an official investigation into the Government of the Dutch East Indies for the first time in its history.

After the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, the VOC&#x27;s financial issues worsened considerably. After vain attempts at reorganisation by the provincial States of Holland and Zeeland, the board of directors in the VOC were sacked in 1796 and the company&#x27;s management was handed over to a &quot;Committee for Affairs relating to East India Trade and Possessions&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Comité tot de zaken van de Oost-Indische handel en bezittingen&quot;). The VOC charter was renewed several times, but was allowed to expire on 31 December 1799. Most of the possessions of the former VOC were subsequently occupied by Great Britain during the Napoleonic wars, but after the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands was created by the Congress of Vienna, some of these were restored to this successor state of the Dutch Republic by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814.

==Organisational structure==
While the VOC mainly operated in what later became the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), the company also had important operations elsewhere. It employed people from different continents and origins in the same functions and working environments. Although it was a Dutch company, its employees included not only people from the Netherlands, but also many from Germany and other countries. Besides the diverse north-west European workforce recruited by the VOC in the Dutch Republic, the VOC made extensive use of local Asian labour markets. As a result, the personnel of the various VOC offices in Asia consisted of European and Asian employees. Asian or Eurasian workers could be employed as sailors, soldiers, writers, carpenters, smiths, or as simple unskilled workers. At the height of its existence, the VOC had 25,000 employees who worked in Asia and 11,000 who were en route. Also, while most of its shareholders were Dutch, about a quarter of the initial shareholders were Zuid-Nederlanders (people from an area that includes modern Belgium and Luxembourg), and there were also a few dozen Germans.

The VOC had two types of shareholders: the &quot;participanten&quot;, who could be seen as non-managing members, and the 76 &quot;bewindhebbers&quot; (later reduced to 60) who acted as managing directors. This was the usual set-up for Dutch joint-stock companies at the time. The innovation in the case of the VOC was that the liability of not just the &quot;participanten&quot; but also of the &quot;bewindhebbers&quot; was limited to the paid-in capital (usually, &quot;bewindhebbers&quot; had unlimited liability). The VOC therefore was a limited liability company. Also, the capital would be &quot;permanent&quot; during the lifetime of the company. As a consequence, investors that wished to liquidate their interest in the interim could only do this by selling their share to others on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
&quot;Confusion of confusions&quot;, a 1688 dialogue by the Sephardi Jew Joseph de la Vega analysed the workings of this one-stock exchange.

The VOC consisted of six Chambers (&quot;Kamers&quot;) in port cities: Amsterdam, Delft, Rotterdam, Enkhuizen, Middelburg and Hoorn. Delegates of these chambers convened as the &quot;Heeren XVII&quot; (the Lords Seventeen). They were selected from the &quot;bewindhebber&quot;-class of shareholders.

Of the &quot;Heeren XVII&quot;, eight delegates were from the Chamber of Amsterdam (one short of a majority on its own), four from the Chamber of Zeeland, and one from each of the smaller Chambers, while the seventeenth seat was alternatively from the Chamber of Middelburg-Zeeland or rotated among the five small Chambers. Amsterdam had thereby the decisive voice. The Zeelanders in particular had misgivings about this arrangement at the beginning. The fear was not unfounded, because in practice it meant Amsterdam stipulated what happened.

The six chambers raised the start-up capital of the Dutch East India Company:
The raising of capital in Rotterdam did not go so smoothly. A considerable part originated from inhabitants of Dordrecht. Although it did not raise as much capital as Amsterdam or Middelburg-Zeeland, Enkhuizen had the largest input in the share capital of the VOC. Under the first 358 shareholders, there were many small entrepreneurs, who dared to take the risk. The minimum investment in the VOC was 3,000 guilders, which priced the company&#x27;s stock within the means of many merchants.

Among the early shareholders of the VOC, immigrants played an important role. Under the 1,143 tenderers were 39 Germans and no fewer than 301 from the Southern Netherlands (roughly present Belgium and Luxembourg, then under Habsburg rule), of whom Isaac le Maire was the largest subscriber with ƒ85,000. VOC&#x27;s total capitalisation was ten times that of its British rival.

The &quot;Heeren XVII&quot; (Lords Seventeen) met alternately six years in Amsterdam and two years in Middelburg-Zeeland. They defined the VOC&#x27;s general policy and divided the tasks among the Chambers. The Chambers carried out all the necessary work, built their own ships and warehouses and traded the merchandise. The &quot;Heeren XVII&quot; sent the ships&#x27; masters off with extensive instructions on the route to be navigated, prevailing winds, currents, shoals and landmarks. The VOC also produced its own charts.

In the context of the Dutch–Portuguese War the company established its headquarters in Batavia, Java (now Jakarta, Indonesia). Other colonial outposts were also established in the East Indies, such as on the Maluku Islands, which include the Banda Islands, where the VOC forcibly maintained a monopoly over nutmeg and mace. Methods used to maintain the monopoly involved extortion and the violent suppression of the native population, including mass murder. In addition, VOC representatives sometimes used the tactic of burning spice trees to force indigenous populations to grow other crops, thus artificially cutting the supply of spices like nutmeg and cloves.

==Shareholder activism and governance issues==
The seventeenth-century Dutch businessmen, especially the VOC investors, were possibly history&#x27;s first recorded investors to seriously consider the problems of corporate governance. Isaac Le Maire, who is known as history&#x27;s first recorded short seller, was also a sizeable shareholder of the VOC. In 1609, he complained of the VOC&#x27;s poor corporate governance. On 24 January 1609, Le Maire filed a petition against the VOC, marking the first recorded expression of shareholder activism. In what is the first recorded corporate governance dispute, Le Maire formally charged that the VOC&#x27;s board of directors (the Heeren XVII) sought to &quot;retain another&#x27;s money for longer or use it ways other than the latter wishes&quot; and petitioned for the liquidation of the VOC in accordance with standard business practice. Initially the largest single shareholder in the VOC and a &quot;bewindhebber&quot; sitting on the board of governors, Le Maire apparently attempted to divert the firm&#x27;s profits to himself by undertaking 14 expeditions under his own accounts instead of those of the company. Since his large shareholdings were not accompanied by greater voting power, Le Maire was soon ousted by other governors in 1605 on charges of embezzlement, and was forced to sign an agreement not to compete with the VOC. Having retained stock in the company following this incident, in 1609 Le Maire would become the author of what is celebrated as &quot;first recorded expression of shareholder advocacy at a publicly traded company&quot;.

In 1622, the history&#x27;s first recorded shareholder revolt also happened among the VOC investors who complained that the company account books had been &quot;smeared with bacon&quot; so that they might be &quot;eaten by dogs.&quot; The investors demanded a &quot;reeckeninge,&quot; a proper financial audit. The 1622 campaign by the shareholders of the VOC is a testimony of genesis of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in which shareholders staged protests by distributing pamphlets and complaining about management self enrichment and secrecy.

==Main trading posts, settlements, and colonies==

The company&#x27;s global headquarters were in Amsterdam, although it had other posts in the Dutch cities of Delft, Enkhuizen, Hoorn, Middelburg and Rotterdam. In Africa, the trading posts and colonies were in Dutch Mauritius; in 1638-1658 and 1664–1710, and in Dutch Cape Colony; between 1652 and 1806. The South Asian and Indonesian posts and colonies of the company in Asia, were in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, Dutch Coromandel in 1806–1825, Dutch Suratte in 1616-1825 Dutch Bengal from 1827 to 1825, Dutch Ceylon from 1640 to 1796, and Dutch Malabar from 1661 to 1795. The Japanese post was in Hirado, Nagasaki from 1609 to 1641, but was relocated to Dejima from 1641 to 1853. In Taiwan, the company had bases in Anping (Fort Zeelandia), Tainan (Fort Provincia), Wang-an, Penghu on the Pescadores Islands (Fort Vlissingen; 1620–1624), Keelung (Fort Noord-Holland and Fort Victoria) and Tamsui (Fort Antonio). In Malaysia, the company was based in Dutch Malacca in 1641-1795 and 1818–1825). In Thailand, the company was based in Ayutthaya in 1608–1767. In Vietnam, the company was based in Hanoi/Tonkin in 1636–1699, and in Hội An in 1636–1741.


==&quot;VOC mentality&quot;==
The VOC&#x27;s history (and especially its dark side) has always been a potential source of controversy. In 2006 when the Dutch Prime Minister Jan Pieter Balkenende referred to the pioneering entrepreneurial spirit and work ethics of the Dutch people and Dutch Republic in their Golden Age, he coined the term &quot;VOC mentality&quot; (&quot;VOC-mentaliteit&quot; in Dutch). For Balkenende, the VOC represented Dutch business acumen, entrepreneurship, adventurous spirit, and decisiveness. However, it unleashed a wave of criticism, since such romantic views about the Dutch Golden Age ignores the inherent historical associations with colonialism, exploitation and violence. Balkenende later stressed that &quot;it had not been his intention to refer to that at all&quot;. But in spite of criticisms, the &quot;VOC-mentality&quot;, as a characteristic of the selective historical perspective on the Dutch Golden Age, has been considered a key feature of Dutch cultural policy for many years.

==Criticism==
The company has been criticised for the results of its quasi-absolute commercial monopoly, colonialism, exploitation (including use of slave labour), slave trade, use of violence, environmental destruction (including deforestation), and for its overly bureaucratic organisational structure.

Batavia, corresponding to present day Jakarta, was the headquarters of the Dutch East India Company, and had a strict social hierarchy in the colony. According to Marsely L. Kahoe in &quot;The Journal of Historians of Netherlandish Art&quot;, &quot;it is misleading to understand Batavia, as some scholars have, as representing a pragmatic and egalitarian order that was later corrupted by the colonial situation. In fact, the social stratification and segregation of Batavia derived in certain ways directly from its Dutch plan.&quot;

There was an extraordinarily high mortality rate among employees of the VOC due to shipwrecks, illnesses such as scurvy and dysentery, and clashes with rival trading companies and pirates. Between 1602 and 1795, about one million seamen and craftsmen departed from Holland, but only 340,000 returned. J.L. van Zanden writes that &quot;the VOC &#x27;consumed&#x27; approximately 4,000 people per year.&quot;

===Colonialism, monopoly and violence===
The VOC charter allowed it to act as a quasi-sovereign state and engaged in brutal conquests. One example is the Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands, between 1609 and 1621, after the islands resisted the nutmeg monopoly. The Dutch launched punitive expeditions that resulted in the near-destruction of Bandanese society. They invaded the main Bandanese island of Lontor in 1621. 2,800 Bandanese were killed, mostly from famine, and 1,700 were enslaved during the attack. The total population of the islands was estimated at 15,000 people before the conquest. Although the exact number remains uncertain, it is estimated that around 14,000 people were killed, enslaved or fled elsewhere, with only 1,000 Bandanese surviving in the islands, and were spread throughout the nutmeg groves as forced labourers. The treatment of slaves was harsh and the native Bandanese population dropped to 1,000 by 1681. 200 slaves were imported annually to sustain the slave population at a total of 4,000.

===Dutch slave trade and slavery under the VOC colonial rule===
By the time the settlement was established at the Cape in 1652, the VOC already had a long experience of practicing slavery in the East Indies. Jan van Riebeeck concluded within two months of the establishment of the Cape settlement that slave labor would be needed for the hardest and dirtiest work. Initially, the VOC considered enslaving men from the indigenous Khoikhoi population, but the idea was rejected on the grounds that such a policy would be both costly and dangerous. Most Khoikhoi had chosen not to labor for the Dutch because of low wages and harsh conditions. In the beginning, the settlers traded with the Khoikhoi, but the harsh working conditions and low wages imposed by the Dutch led to a series of wars. The European population remained under 200 during the settlement&#x27;s first five years, and war against neighbors numbering more than 20,000 would have been foolhardy. Moreover, the Dutch feared that Khoikhoi people, if enslaved, could always escape into the local community, whereas foreigners would find it much more difficult to escape and survive or avoid recapture.

Between 1652 and 1657, a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to obtain men from the Dutch East Indies and from Mauritius. In 1658, however, the VOC landed two shiploads of slaves at the Cape, one containing more than 200 people brought from Dahomey (later Benin), the second with almost 200 people, most of them children, captured from a Portuguese slaver off the coast of Angola. Except for a few individuals, these were to be the only slaves ever brought to the Cape from West Africa. From 1658 to the end of the company&#x27;s rule, many more slaves were brought regularly to the Cape in various ways, chiefly by Company-sponsored slaving voyages and slaves brought to the Cape by its return fleets. From these sources and by natural growth, the slave population increased from zero in 1652 to about 1,000 by 1700. During the 18th century, the slave population increased dramatically to 16,839 by 1795. After the slave trade was initiated, all of the slaves imported into the Cape until the British stopped the trade in 1807 were from East Africa, Mozambique, Madagascar, and South and Southeast Asia. Large numbers were brought from Ceylon and the Indonesian archipelago. Prisoners from other countries in the VOC&#x27;s empire were also enslaved. The slave population, which exceeded that of the European settlers until the first quarter of the nineteenth century, was overwhelmingly male and was thus dependent on constant imports of new slaves to maintain and to augment its size.

By the 1660s the Cape settlement was importing slaves from Ceylon, Malaya (Malaysia), and Madagascar to work on the farms. Conflict between Dutch farmers and Khoikhoi broke out once it became clear to the latter that the Dutch were there to stay and that they intended to encroach on the lands of the pastoralists. In 1659 Doman, a Khoikhoi who had worked as a translator for the Dutch and had even traveled to Java, led an armed attempt to expel the Dutch from the Cape peninsula. The attempt was a failure, although warfare dragged on until an inconclusive peace was established a year later. During the following decade, pressure on the Khoikhoi grew as more of the Dutch became free burghers, expanded their landholdings, and sought pastureland for their growing herds. War broke out again in 1673 and continued until 1677, when Khoikhoi resistance was destroyed by a combination of superior European weapons and Dutch manipulation of divisions among the local people. Thereafter, Khoikhoi society in the western Cape disintegrated. Some people found jobs as shepherds on European farms; others rejected foreign rule and moved away from the Cape. The final blow for most came in 1713 when a Dutch ship brought smallpox to the Cape. Hitherto unknown locally, the disease ravaged the remaining Khoikhoi, killing 90 percent of the population. Throughout the eighteenth century, the settlement continued to expand through internal growth of the European population and the continued importation of slaves. The approximately 3,000 Europeans and slaves at the Cape in 1700 had increased by the end of the century to nearly 20,000 Europeans, and approximately 25,000 slaves.

==Archives and records==
The VOC&#x27;s operations (trading posts and colonies) produced not only warehouses packed with spices, coffee, tea, textiles, porcelain and silk, but also shiploads of documents. Data on political, economic, cultural, religious, and social conditions spread over an enormous area circulated between the VOC establishments, the administrative centre of the trade in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta), and the board of directors (the /Gentlemen Seventeen) in the Dutch Republic. The VOC records are included in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register.

<doc id="42739" wikidata="Q2624879" url="?curid=42739" title="Bubble fusion">
<text>Bubble fusion is the non-technical name for a nuclear fusion reaction hypothesized to occur inside extraordinarily large collapsing gas bubbles created in a liquid during acoustic cavitation. The more technical name is sonofusion.

The term was coined in 2002 with the release of a report by Rusi Taleyarkhan and collaborators that claimed to have observed evidence of sonofusion. The claim was quickly surrounded by controversy, including allegations ranging from experimental error to academic fraud. Subsequent publications claiming independent verification of sonofusion were also highly controversial.

Eventually, an investigation by Purdue University found that Taleyarkhan had engaged in falsification of independent verification, and had included a student as an author on a paper when he had not participated in the research. He was subsequently stripped of his professorship. One of his funders, the Office of Naval Research reviewed the report by Purdue and barred him from federal funding for 28 months.

== Original experiments ==
US patent 4,333,796, filed by Hugh Flynn in 1978, appears to be the earliest documented reference to a sonofusion-type reaction.

In the March 8, 2002 issue of the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Science&quot;, Rusi P. Taleyarkhan and colleagues at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) reported that acoustic cavitation experiments conducted with deuterated acetone () showed measurements of tritium and neutron output consistent with the occurrence of fusion. The neutron emission was also reported to be coincident with the sonoluminescence pulse, a key indicator that its source was fusion caused by the heat and pressure inside the collapsing bubbles.

== Oak Ridge failed replication ==
The results were so startling that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory asked two independent researchers, D. Shapira and M. J. Saltmarsh, to repeat the experiment using more sophisticated neutron detection equipment. They reported that the neutron release was consistent with random coincidence. A rebuttal by Taleyarkhan and the other authors of the original report argued that the Shapira and Saltmarsh report failed to account for significant differences in experimental setup, including over an inch of shielding between the neutron detector and the sonoluminescing acetone. According to Taleyarkhan &quot;et al.&quot;, when properly considering those differences, the results were consistent with fusion.

As early as 2002, while experimental work was still in progress, Aaron Galonsky of Michigan State University, in a letter to the journal &quot;Science&quot;
expressed doubts about the claim made by the Taleyarkhan team. In Galonsky&#x27;s opinion, the observed neutrons were too high in energy to be from a deuterium-deuterium (d-d) fusion reaction. In their response (published on the same page), the Taleyarkhan team provided detailed counter-arguments and concluded that the energy was &quot;reasonably close&quot; to that which was expected from a fusion reaction.

In February 2005 the documentary series &quot;Horizon&quot; commissioned two leading sonoluminescence researchers, Seth Putterman and Kenneth S. Suslick, to reproduce Taleyarkhan&#x27;s work. Using similar acoustic parameters, deuterated acetone, similar bubble nucleation, and a much more sophisticated neutron detection device, the researchers could find no evidence of a fusion reaction.

== Subsequent reports of replication ==
In 2004, new reports of bubble fusion were published by the Taleyarkhan group, claiming that the results of previous experiments had been replicated under more stringent experimental conditions. These results differed from the original results in that fusion was claimed to occur over longer times than previously reported. The original report only claimed neutron emission from the initial bubble collapse following bubble nucleation, whereas this report claimed neutron emission many acoustic cycles later.

In July 2005, two of Taleyarkhan&#x27;s students at Purdue University published evidence confirming the previous result. They used the same acoustic chamber, the same deuterated acetone fluid and a similar bubble nucleation system. In this report, no neutron-sonoluminescence coincidence was attempted. An article in &quot;Nature&quot; raised issues about the validity of the research and complaints from his Purdue colleagues (see full analysis elsewhere in this page). Charges of misconduct were raised, and Purdue University opened an investigation. It concluded in 2008 that Taleyarkhan&#x27;s name should have appeared in the author list because of his deep involvement in many steps of the research, that he added one author that had not really participated in the paper just to overcome the criticism of one reviewer, and that this was part of an attempt of &quot;an effort to falsify the scientific record by assertion of independent confirmation&quot;. The investigation did not address the validity of the experimental results.

In January 2006, a paper published in the journal &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; by Taleyarkhan in collaboration with researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute reported statistically significant evidence of fusion.

In November 2006, in the midst of accusations concerning Taleyarkhan&#x27;s research standards, two different scientists visited the meta-stable fluids research lab at Purdue University to measure neutrons, using Taleyarkhan&#x27;s equipment. Dr. Edward R. Forringer and undergraduates David Robbins and Jonathan Martin of LeTourneau University presented two papers at the American Nuclear Society Winter Meeting that reported replication of neutron emission. Their experimental setup was similar to previous experiments in that it used a mixture of deuterated acetone, deuterated benzene, tetrachloroethylene and uranyl nitrate. Notably, however, it operated without an external neutron source and used two types of neutron detectors. They claimed a liquid scintillation detector measured neutron levels at 8 standard deviations above the background level, while plastic detectors measured levels at 3.8 standard deviations above the background. When the same experiment was performed with non-deuterated control liquid, the measurements were within one standard deviation of background, indicating that the neutron production had only occurred during cavitation of the deuterated liquid. William M. Bugg, emeritus physics professor at the University of Tennessee also traveled to Taleyarkhan&#x27;s lab to repeat the experiment with his equipment. He also reported neutron emission, using plastic neutron detectors. Taleyarkhan claimed these visits counted as independent replications by experts, but Forringer later recognized that he was not an expert, and Bugg later said that Taleyarkhan performed the experiments and he had only watched.

== &quot;Nature&quot; report ==
In March 2006, &quot;Nature&quot; published a special report that called into question the validity of the results of the Purdue experiments. The report quotes Brian Naranjo of the University of California, Los Angeles to the effect that neutron energy spectrum reported in the 2006 paper by Taleyarkhan, et al. was statistically inconsistent with neutrons produced by the proposed fusion reaction and instead highly consistent with neutrons produced by the radioactive decay of Californium 252, an isotope commonly used as a laboratory neutron source.

The response of Taleyarkhan &quot;et al.&quot;, published in &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;, attempts to refute Naranjo&#x27;s hypothesis as to the cause of the neutrons detected.

Tsoukalas, head of the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue, and several of his colleagues at Purdue, had convinced Taleyarkhan to move to Purdue and attempt a joint replication. In the 2006 &quot;Nature&quot; report they detail several troubling issues when trying to collaborate with Taleyarkhan. He reported positive results from certain set of raw data, but his colleagues had also examined that set and it only contained negative results. He never showed his colleagues the raw data corresponding to the positive results, despite several requests. He moved the equipment from a shared laboratory to his own laboratory, thus impeding review by his colleagues, and he did not give any advance warning or explanation for the move. Taleyarkhan convinced his colleagues that they should not publish a paper with their negative results. Taleyarkhan then insisted that the university&#x27;s press release present his experiment as &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; and &quot;independent&quot;, when the co-authors were working in his laboratory under his supervision, and his peers in the faculty were not allowed to review the data. In summary, Taleyarkhan&#x27;s colleagues at Purdue said he placed obstacles to peer review of his experiments, and they had serious doubts about the validity of the research.

&quot;Nature&quot; also revealed that the process of anonymous peer-review had not been followed, and that the journal &quot;Nuclear Engineering and Design&quot; was not independent from the authors. Taleyarkhan was co-editor of the journal, and the paper was only peer-reviewed by his co-editor, with Taleyarkhan&#x27;s knowledge.

In 2002, Taleyarkhan filed a patent application on behalf of the United States Department of Energy, while working in Oak Ridge. &quot;Nature&quot; reported that the patent had been rejected in 2005 by the US Patent Office. The examiner called the experiment a variation of discredited cold fusion, found that there was &quot;no reputable evidence of record to support any allegations or claims that the invention is capable of operating as indicated&quot;, and found that there was not enough detail for others to replicate the invention. The field of fusion suffered from many flawed claims, thus the examiner asked for additional proof that the radiation was generated from fusion and not from other sources. An appeal was not filed because the Department of Energy had dropped the claim in December 2005.

== Doubts prompt investigation ==
Doubts among Purdue University&#x27;s Nuclear Engineering faculty as to whether the positive results reported from sonofusion experiments conducted there were truthful prompted the university to initiate a review of the research, conducted by Purdue&#x27;s Office of the Vice President for Research. In a March 9, 2006 article entitled &quot;Evidence for bubble fusion called into question&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot; interviewed several of Taleyarkhan&#x27;s colleagues who suspected something was amiss.

On February 7, 2007, the Purdue University administration determined that &quot;the evidence does not support the allegations of research misconduct and that no further investigation of the allegations is warranted&quot;. Their report also stated that &quot;vigorous, open debate of the scientific merits of this new technology is the most appropriate focus going forward.&quot; In order to verify that the investigation was properly conducted, House Representative Brad Miller requested full copies of its documents and reports by March 30, 2007. His congressional report concluded that &quot;Purdue deviated from its own procedures in investigating this case and did not conduct a thorough investigation&quot;; in response, Purdue announced that it would re-open its investigation.

In June 2008, a multi-institutional team including Taleyarkhan published a paper in Nuclear Engineering and Design to &quot;clear up misconceptions generated by a webposting of UCLA which served as the basis for the &quot;Nature&quot; article of March 2006&quot;, according to a press release.

On July 18, 2008, Purdue University announced that a committee with members from five institutions had investigated 12 allegations of research misconduct against Rusi Taleyarkhan. It concluded that two allegations were founded—that Taleyarkhan had claimed independent confirmation of his work when in reality the apparent confirmations were done by Taleyarkhan&#x27;s former students and was not as &quot;independent&quot; as Taleyarkhan implied, and that Taleyarkhan had included a colleague&#x27;s name on one of his papers who had not actually been involved in the research (&quot;the sole apparent motivation for the addition of Mr. Bugg was a desire to overcome a reviewer&#x27;s criticism&quot;, the report concluded).

Taleyarkhan&#x27;s appeal of the report&#x27;s conclusions was rejected. He said the two allegations of misconduct were trivial administrative issues and had nothing to do with the discovery of bubble nuclear fusion or the underlying science, and that &quot;all allegations of fraud and fabrication have been dismissed as invalid and without merit — thereby supporting the underlying science and experimental data as being on solid ground&quot;. A researcher questioned by the LA Times said that the report had not clarified whether bubble fusion was real or not, but that the low quality of the papers and the doubts cast by the report had destroyed Taleyarkhan&#x27;s credibility with the scientific community.

On August 27, 2008, he was stripped of his named Arden Bement Jr. Professorship, and forbidden to be a thesis advisor for graduate students for at least the next 3 years.

Despite the findings against him, Taleyarkhan received a $185,000 grant from the National Science Foundation between September 2008 and August 2009 to investigate bubble fusion. In 2009 the Office of Naval Research debarred him for 28 months, until September 2011, from receiving U.S. Federal Funding. During that period his name was listed in the &#x27;Excluded Parties List&#x27; to prevent him from receiving further grants from any government agency.

<text>The Municipal Art Society of New York (MAS) is a non-profit membership organization for preservation in New York City, which aims to encourage thoughtful planning and urban design and inclusive neighborhoods across the city.

The organization was founded in 1893. In January 2010, MAS relocated from its longtime home in the historic Villard Houses on 457 Madison Avenue to Steinway Hall on West 57th Street (across the street and east of Carnegie Hall). In July 2014, MAS moved into the Look Building at 488 Madison Avenue, across the street from its former Villard home.

==History==
MAS&#x27;s advocacy efforts have shaped the city a great deal since its inception in 1893. Some of their early accomplishments include passage of the city&#x27;s first zoning laws, contributing input to the planning of the city&#x27;s subway line, and the commissioning of public art throughout the city.

By the 1950s, scores of notable Manhattan buildings were lost to redevelopment around the city, and the mission of MAS broadened to include historical preservation. In 1956, the Society successfully lobbied for the passage of the Bard Law, which for the first time allowed cities to take aesthetics, history, and cultural associations into account for zoning laws. The law, named after longtime MAS board member and chief advocate, Albert S. Bard, provided a legal foundation for the New York City Landmarks Law, enacted in 1965.

In 1965, public outrage over the destruction of Pennsylvania Station and the Brokaw Mansion helped fuel the Society&#x27;s mission towards preservation. With like-minded groups, they finally succeeded in establishing New York&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Commission, and New York&#x27;s Landmarks Law.

In 2001, after the demise of Trans World Airlines, the original Trans World Flight Center, completed in 1962 and designed by Eero Saarinen, fell into disuse. During this period, the Municipal Art Society succeeded in 2004 in nominating the facility to the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s list of the 11 Most Endangered Places.

In June 2007, MAS released with the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance a new documentary about the future of the New York waterfront titled City of Water. In September 2007, the Society opened a major exhibition about Jane Jacobs sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation.

==Urban Center==
The Municipal Art Society used to operate out of the Urban Center, a gallery on Madison Avenue. The gallery, founded in 1980, served to champion the fields of urban planning and design in New York, and was also the site of MAS&#x27; community development workshops, seminars, lectures, and other educational programs. The Urban Center also included a book store which specialized in architecture, urban planning, urban design, and environmental studies.

The Urban Center was located in Villard Houses from 1980 to 2010 where upon it moved to West 57th Street.

The Center no longer operates, since the Municipal Art Society moved to 488 Madison Avenue in 2014.

== Advocacy ==
Through its advocacy, MAS protects New York’s legacy spaces, encourages thoughtful planning and urban design, and fosters complete neighborhoods across the five boroughs. Since 2007, the organization has hosted the Livable Neighborhoods Program (LNP). This program helps local leaders in under-resourced communities throughout New York City develop the knowledge and tools that they need to participate effectively in public land use review processes, plus engage in creative, community-based design and planning. Past alumni of the program include, Landmark East Harlem, Brownsville Community Justice Center, and Asian Americans for Equality.

A notable project supported and funded by the Society was the 1980 film &quot;The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces&quot; by William Whyte.

== Tours and programs ==
Since 1956, the Municipal Art Society has offered walking tours about architecture and history across the five boroughs. MAS offers both virtual and in-person tours throughout the year. Additionally, the Municipal Art Society produces programming all across the city throughout the year, including book talks and panel conversations. Since 2011, MAS has hosted the New York City chapter of the global Jane&#x27;s Walk festival, which celebrates the legacy of urbanist Jane Jacobs. The walks range from any New York City topic, including culture, history, nature and more.

== Awards ==
Since 1987, the Municipal Art Society of New York has annually awarded the Brendan Gill Prize to the creator of a creative work that &quot;best captures the spirit and energy of New York City.&quot; The award was established in honor of Brendan Gill, New Yorker theater and architecture critic and long-time MAS Board Member. Past honorees have included Sufjan Stevens, John Wilson, Rebecca Solnit, Kara Walker, Ang Lee, and Gran Fury.

Since 2001, MAS has annually awarded six MASterworks Awards to exceptional New York City architecture and landscape architecture projects from the previous year. The list of past winners includes Weeksville Heritage Center, the Tenement Museum, Brooklyn Public Library, Little Island, and Moynihan Train Hall.

<doc id="42745" wikidata="Q10863000" url="?curid=42745" title="Los Angeles Pierce College">
<text>Los Angeles Pierce College, shortened to Pierce College or simply Pierce, is a public community college in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California. It is part of the Los Angeles Community College District and is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges. It serves 22,000 students each semester.

The college began with 70 students and 18 faculty members on September 15, 1947. Originally known as the Clarence W. Pierce School of Agriculture, the institution&#x27;s initial focus was crop cultivation and animal husbandry. Nine years later, in 1956, the school was renamed to Los Angeles Pierce Junior College, retaining the name of its founder, Dr. Pierce, as well as his commitment to agricultural and veterinary study. (Pierce still maintains a working farm for hands-on training.)

== Academics ==
Pierce College offers courses on more than 100 subjects in 92 academic disciplines, and has transfer alliances with most of the universities in the state. Students at the school successfully transfer to UC and CSU schools.

Students can pursue any of the 44 associate&#x27;s degrees or 78 Certificates of Achievement the school offers directly.

== Campus ==
Pierce College comprises amidst a dense metropolis, an area larger than many university campuses, including that of UCLA. The grounds are landscaped with more than 2,200 trees, thousands of roses and a botanical garden. The Pierce College farm houses small herds of cattle, sheep, goats, and a small poultry flock for its students to learn from.

In June 2017, the Los Angeles Community College District Board Of Trustees voted to grant San Francisco Bay Area-based Pacific Dining a concession for dining services, replacing several small vendors at the five LACCD colleges including Pierce. Pacific Dining has not offered food at Pierce since 2020, resulting in few food options on campus. 

== John Shepard Stadium ==


Besides hosting the Brahmas&#x27; football and women&#x27;s soccer teams, John Shepard Stadium (current capacity 5,500) also has hosted many outdoor professional sporting events in San Fernando Valley history.

From 1976 to 1979, the San Fernando Valley&#x27;s first professional sports team, the Los Angeles Skyhawks of the American Soccer League, played their home games at the Pierce College stadium.

The Los Angeles Express of the USFL played their last home game here on June 15, 1985. The stadium was expanded to 16,000-person capacity for the game.

Shepard Stadium hosts Nuts for Mutts, an annual dog show and pet fair that raises funds for the New Leash on Life Animal Rescue.

The stadium is also the former home stadium of the San Fernando Valley Quakes men&#x27;s soccer team, which competed in the USL Premier Development League.

==Transport==
Los Angeles Pierce College has its own stop on the Metro G/Orange Line, the Pierce College station, on Winnetka Avenue near Victory Boulevard.

==Solar power==
Pierce College has a 191-kilowatt solar generation system that has 1,274 photovoltaic panels and a 360-kilowatt, natural gas co-generation system. This project is the largest of its kind to be undertaken by a U.S. community college, yielding around 4.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 1,500 tons over its operating lifetime. The college also has a water retention pond beneath its soccer field, collecting run-off from the adjacent parking lot. The Los Angeles River is nearby to the north. Under propositions A and AA, a new water reclamation facility is also being planned, and the new facilities will meet rigorous Silver-level guidelines set by the U.S. Green Building Council for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.

==Old Trapper&#x27;s Lodge==
The campus is home to Old Trapper&#x27;s Lodge, California Historical Landmark No. 939.5, an outsider art environment that pays homage to the pioneer upbringing of its creator John Ehn. It represents the life work of John Ehn (1897–1981), a self-taught artist who wished to pass on a sense of the Old West, derived from personal experiences, myths, and tall tales. From 1951 to 1981, using his family as models, and incorporating memorabilia, the &#x27;Old Trapper&#x27; followed his dreams and visions to create the Lodge and its &#x27;Boot Hill.&#x27; The artwork was moved from the original site in Sun Valley, CA, and relocated to the college.

==Pierce College Farm and Farm Center==
The Pierce College Farm covers of the college with several units for their animals. The farm has a $13 million equestrian center used for agricultural students&#x27; education that offers UC transferable courses for important animal and veterinary science programs.

In April of every year, the Foundation for Pierce College hosts Farmwalk, an outdoor festival including animals, activities, displays, games and music. The Farmwalk also includes face-painting, a petting-zoo and hayrides for children, all to benefit the Pierce College farm.

The Farm Center on the corner of Victory Boulevard and De Soto Avenue is a parcel that was partnered between the Foundation for Pierce College and the McBroom family. The McBroom family have invested nearly $3.5 million to operate the Farm Center which covered utility, labor, insurance, and other operational costs. In October the Foundation sponsored an annual Harvest Festival, featuring pumpkins grown on the Pierce farm, a corn maze, rock climbing, games and rides for the children, a petting zoo, live music and Halloween frights for the whole family. In late December 2014, the Farm Center was evicted from Pierce College, and closed to the public.

The college also serves as a Los Angeles County large animal emergency evacuation center. During a slew of fires in Southern California in 2007, Pierce College sheltered and fed more than 150 horses under the direction of the L.A. County Volunteer Equine Response team. The horses were taken in for free at Pierce, and a veterinarian was onsite. Trained volunteers from Pierce&#x27;s equestrian program assisted the county rescue effort.

== Weather station ==
The Pierce College weather station was one of the first to cooperate with the government to provide archived data online as well as being one of the oldest operational cooperative weather stations in the country. It was founded under the direction of Professor A. Lee Haines on July 1, 1949, two years after the college was founded. In 2009, the Pierce College Weather Station was awarded $85,000 used to provide the station with new sensors that are rare for co-op stations in the U.S. The Weather Station organizes tours showing their equipment and their functions upon request.

== Athletics ==
The college athletic teams are nicknamed the Brahmas and currently fields six men&#x27;s and six women&#x27;s varsity teams. Pierce competes as a member of the California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA) in the Western State Conference (WSC) for all sports except football, which competes in Southern California Football Association (SCFA). In 2009 the Pierce Brahmas won the American Pacific Conference, losing in the first round of bowl playoffs to the National Champs Mt. San Antonio College.

==Student government==
The students of Pierce College have established a student body association named Los Angeles Pierce College Associated Student Organization (ASO). The association is required by law to &quot;encourage students to participate in the governance of the college&quot;.

The ASO periodically participates in meetings sponsored by a statewide community college student organization named Student Senate for California Community Colleges. The statewide Student Senate is authorized by law &quot;to advocate before the Legislature and other state and local governmental entities&quot;.

<text>Jakarta Enterprise Beans (EJB; formerly Enterprise JavaBeans) is one of several Java APIs for modular construction of enterprise software. EJB is a server-side software component that encapsulates business logic of an application. An EJB web container provides a runtime environment for web related software components, including computer security, Java servlet lifecycle management, transaction processing, and other web services. The EJB specification is a subset of the Java EE specification.

== Specification ==
The EJB specification was originally developed in 1997 by IBM and later adopted by Sun Microsystems (EJB 1.0 and 1.1) in 1999 and enhanced under the Java Community Process as JSR 19 (EJB 2.0), JSR 153 (EJB 2.1), JSR 220 (EJB 3.0), JSR 318 (EJB 3.1) and JSR 345 (EJB 3.2).

The EJB specification provides a standard way to implement the server-side (also called &quot;back-end&quot;) &#x27;business&#x27; software typically found in enterprise applications (as opposed to &#x27;front-end&#x27; user interface software). Such software addresses the same types of problem, and solutions to these problems are often repeatedly re-implemented by programmers. Jakarta Enterprise Beans is intended to handle such common concerns as persistence, transactional integrity and security in a standard way, leaving programmers free to concentrate on the particular parts of the enterprise software at hand.

== General responsibilities ==
The EJB specification details how an application server provides the following responsibilities:
* Transaction processing
* Integration with the persistence services offered by the Jakarta Persistence (JPA)
* Concurrency control
* Event-driven programming using Jakarta Messaging (JMS) and Jakarta Connectors (JCA)
* Asynchronous method invocation
* Job scheduling
* Naming and directory services via Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)
* Interprocess Communication using RMI-IIOP and Web services
* Security (JCE and JAAS)
* Deployment of software components in an application server

Additionally, the Jakarta Enterprise Beans specification defines the roles played by the EJB container and the EJBs as well as how to deploy the EJBs in a container. Note that the EJB specification does not detail how an application server provides persistence (a task delegated to the JPA specification), but instead details how business logic can easily integrate with the persistence services offered by the application server.

== History ==
Businesses found that using EJBs to encapsulate business logic brought a performance penalty. This is because the original specification allowed only for remote method invocation through CORBA (and optionally other protocols), even though the large majority of business applications actually do not require this distributed computing functionality. The EJB 2.0 specification addressed this concern by adding the concept of local interfaces which could be called directly without performance penalties by applications that were not distributed over multiple servers.

The EJB 3.0 specification (JSR 220) was a departure from its predecessors, following a new light-weight paradigm. EJB 3.0 shows an influence from Spring in its use of plain Java objects, and its support for dependency injection to simplify configuration and integration of heterogeneous systems. EJB 3.0 along with the other version of the EJB can be integrated with MuleSoft-v4 using MuleSoft certified PlektonLabs EJB Connector. Gavin King, the creator of Hibernate, participated in the EJB 3.0 process and is an outspoken advocate of the technology. Many features originally in Hibernate were incorporated in the Java Persistence API, the replacement for entity beans in EJB 3.0. The EJB 3.0 specification relies heavily on the use of annotations (a feature added to the Java language with its 5.0 release) and convention over configuration to enable a much less verbose coding style. Accordingly, in practical terms EJB 3.0 is much more lightweight and nearly a completely new API, bearing little resemblance to the previous EJB specifications. 

== Example ==
The following shows a basic example of what an EJB looks like in code:
@Stateless 
public class CustomerService { 

 private EntityManager entityManager; 
 public void addCustomer(Customer customer) { 
 entityManager.persist(customer); 
}
The above defines a service class for persisting a Customer object (via O/R mapping). The EJB takes care of managing the persistence context and the addCustomer() method is transactional and thread-safe by default. As demonstrated, the EJB focuses only on business logic and persistence and knows nothing about any particular presentation.

Such an EJB can be used by a class in e.g. the web layer as follows:
@Named 
@RequestScoped
public class CustomerBacking {
 @EJB 
 private CustomerService customerService;

 public String addCustomer(Customer customer) {
 customerService.addCustomer(customer);
 context.addMessage(...); // abbreviated for brevity
 return &quot;customer_overview&quot;;
}
The above defines a JavaServer Faces (JSF) backing bean in which the EJB is injected by means of the codice_1 annotation. Its addCustomer method is typically bound to some UI component, such as a button. Contrary to the EJB, the backing bean does not contain any business logic or persistence code, but delegates such concerns to the EJB. The backing bean does know about a particular presentation, of which the EJB had no knowledge.

== Types of Enterprise Beans ==
An EJB container holds two major types of beans:
* Session Beans that can be either &quot;Stateful&quot;, &quot;Stateless&quot; or &quot;Singleton&quot; and can be accessed via either a Local (same JVM) or Remote (different JVM) interface or directly without an interface, in which case local semantics apply. All session beans support asynchronous execution for all views (local/remote/no-interface).
* Message Driven Beans (MDBs, also known as Message Beans). MDBs also support asynchronous execution, but via a messaging paradigm.

=== Session beans ===

==== Stateful Session Beans ====

Stateful Session Beans are business objects having state: that is, they keep track of which calling client they are dealing with throughout a session and of the history of its requests, and thus access to the bean instance is strictly limited to only one client during its lifetime. If concurrent access to a single bean is attempted anyway the container serializes those requests, but via the codice_2 annotation the container can instead throw an exception. Stateful session beans&#x27; state may be persisted (passivated) automatically by the container to free up memory after the client hasn&#x27;t accessed the bean for some time. The JPA extended persistence context is explicitly supported by Stateful Session Beans.
; &quot;Examples&quot;:
* Checking out in a web store might be handled by a stateful session bean that would use its state to keep track of where the customer is in the checkout process, possibly holding locks on the items the customer is purchasing (from a system architecture&#x27;s point of view, it would be less ideal to have the client manage those locks).

==== Stateless Session Beans ====
Stateless Session Beans are business objects that do not have state associated with them. However, access to a single bean instance is still limited to only one client at a time, concurrent access to the bean is prohibited. If concurrent access to a single bean is attempted, the container simply routes each request to a different instance. This makes a stateless session bean automatically thread-safe. Instance variables can be used during a single method call from a client to the bean, but the contents of those instance variables are not guaranteed to be preserved across different client method calls. Instances of Stateless Session beans are typically pooled. If a second client accesses a specific bean right after a method call on it made by a first client has finished, it might get the same instance. The lack of overhead to maintain a conversation with the calling client makes them less resource-intensive than stateful beans. 
; &quot;Examples&quot;:
* Sending an e-mail to customer support might be handled by a stateless bean, since this is a one-off operation and not part of a multi-step process.
* A user of a website clicking on a &quot;keep me informed of future updates&quot; box may trigger a call to an asynchronous method of the session bean to add the user to a list in the company&#x27;s database (this call is asynchronous because the user does not need to wait to be informed of its success or failure).
* Fetching multiple independent pieces of data for a website, like a list of products and the history of the current user might be handled by asynchronous methods of a session bean as well (these calls are asynchronous because they can execute in parallel that way, which potentially increases performance). In this case, the asynchronous method will return a Future instance.

==== Singleton Session Beans ====
Singleton Session Beans are business objects having a global shared state within a JVM. Concurrent access to the one and only bean instance can be controlled by the container (Container-managed concurrency, CMC) or by the bean itself (Bean-managed concurrency, BMC). CMC can be tuned using the codice_3 annotation, that designates whether a read lock or a write lock will be used for a method call. Additionally, Singleton Session Beans can explicitly request to be instantiated when the EJB container starts up, using the codice_4 annotation. 
; &quot;Examples&quot;:
* Loading a global daily price list that will be the same for every user might be done with a singleton session bean, since this will prevent the application having to do the same query to a database over and over again...

=== Message driven beans ===
Message Driven Beans are business objects whose execution is triggered by messages instead of by method calls. The Message Driven Bean is used among others to provide a high level ease-of-use abstraction for the lower level JMS (Java Message Service) specification. It may subscribe to JMS message queues or message topics, which typically happens via the activationConfig attribute of the codice_5 annotation. They were added in EJB to allow event-driven processing. Unlike session beans, an MDB does not have a client view (Local/Remote/No-interface), i. e. clients cannot look-up an MDB instance. An MDB just listens for any incoming message on, for example, a JMS queue or topic and processes them automatically. Only JMS support is required by the Java EE spec, but Message Driven Beans can support other messaging protocols. Such protocols may be asynchronous but can also be synchronous. Since session beans can also be synchronous or asynchronous, the prime difference between session- and message driven beans is not the synchronicity, but the difference between (object oriented) method calling and messaging. 
; &quot;Examples&quot;:
* Sending a configuration update to multiple nodes might be done by sending a JMS message to a &#x27;message topic&#x27; and could be handled by a Message Driven Bean listening to this topic (the message paradigm is used here since the sender does not need to know the number of consumers, their location, or even their exact type).
* Submitting a job to a work cluster might be done by sending a JMS message to a &#x27;message queue&#x27; and could also be handled by a Message Driven Bean, but this time listening to a queue (the message paradigm and the queue is used, since the sender doesn&#x27;t have to care which worker executes the job, but it does need assurance that a job is only executed once).
* Processing timing events from the Quartz scheduler can be handled by a Message Driven Bean; when a Quartz &quot;trigger&quot; fires, the MDB is automatically invoked. Since Java EE doesn&#x27;t know about Quartz by default, a JCA resource adapter would be needed and the MDB would be annotated with a reference to this.

== Execution ==
EJBs are deployed in an EJB container, typically within an application server. The specification describes how an EJB interacts with its container and how client code interacts with the container/EJB combination. The EJB classes used by applications are included in the package. (The package is a service provider interface used only by EJB container implementations.)

Clients of EJBs do not instantiate those beans directly via Java&#x27;s new operator, but instead have to obtain a reference via the EJB container. This reference is usually not a reference to the implementation bean itself, but to a proxy, which dynamically implements either the local or remote business interface that the client requested or a sub-type of the actual bean. The proxy can then be directly cast to the interface or bean respectively. A client is said to have a &#x27;view&#x27; on the EJB, and the local interface, remote interface and bean sub-type itself respectively correspond to the local view, remote view and no-interface view.

This proxy is needed in order to give the EJB container the opportunity to transparently provide cross-cutting (AOP-like) services to a bean like transactions, security, interceptions, injections, and remoting. As an example, a client invokes a method on a proxy, which will first start a transaction with the help of the EJB container and then call the actual bean method. When the bean method returns, the proxy ends the transaction (i.e. by committing it or doing a rollback) and transfers control back to the client.

The EJB Container is responsible for ensuring the client code has sufficient access rights to an EJB. Security aspects can be declaratively applied to an EJB via annotations.

=== Transactions ===
EJB containers must support both container managed ACID transactions and bean managed transactions.

Container-managed transactions (CMT) are by default active for calls to session beans. That is, no explicit configuration is needed. This behavior may be declaratively tuned by the bean via annotations and if needed such configuration can later be overridden in the deployment descriptor. Tuning includes switching off transactions for the whole bean or specific methods, or requesting alternative strategies for transaction propagation and starting or joining a transaction. Such strategies mainly deal with what should happen if a transaction is or isn&#x27;t already in progress at the time the bean is called. The following variations are supported:

Alternatively, the bean can also declare via an annotation that it wants to handle transactions programmatically via the JTA API. This mode of operation is called Bean Managed Transactions (BMT), since the bean itself handles the transaction instead of the container.

=== Events ===
JMS (Java Message Service) is used to send messages from beans to clients, to let clients receive asynchronous messages from these beans. 
MDBs can be used to receive messages from clients asynchronously using either a JMS 
Queue or a Topic.

=== Naming and directory services ===
As an alternative to injection, clients of an EJB can obtain a reference to the session bean&#x27;s proxy object (the EJB stub) using Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). This alternative can be used in cases where injection is not available, such as in non-managed code or standalone remote Java SE clients, or when it&#x27;s necessary to programmatically determine which bean to obtain.

JNDI names for EJB session beans are assigned by the EJB container via the following scheme:
&quot;(entries in square brackets denote optional parts)&quot;

A single bean can be obtained by any name matching the above patterns, depending on the &#x27;location&#x27; of the client. Clients in the same module as the required bean can use the module scope and larger scopes, clients in the same application as the required bean can use the app scope and higher, etc.

E.g. code running in the same module as the CustomerService bean &quot;(as given by the example shown earlier in this article)&quot; could use the following code to obtain a (local) reference to it:
CustomerServiceLocal customerService =
 (CustomerServiceLocal) new InitialContext().lookup(&quot;java:module/CustomerService&quot;);
=== Remoting/distributed execution ===
For communication with a client that&#x27;s written in the Java programming language a session bean can expose a remote-view via an interface annotated with codice_6. This allows those beans to be called from clients in other JVMs which may be running on other systems (from the point of view of the EJB container, any code in another JVM is remote).

Stateless and Singleton session beans may also expose a &quot;web service client view&quot; for remote communication via WSDL and SOAP or plain XML. This follows the JAX-RPC and JAX-WS specifications. JAX-RPC support however is proposed for future removal. To support JAX-WS, the session bean is annotated with codice_7, and methods that are to be exposed remotely with codice_8.

Although the EJB specification does not mention exposure as RESTful web services in any way and has no explicit support for this form of communication, the JAX-RS specification does explicitly support EJB. Following the JAX-RS spec, Stateless and Singleton session beans can be declared as root resources via the codice_9 annotation and EJB business methods can be mapped to resource methods via the codice_10, codice_11, codice_12 and codice_13 annotations. This however does not count as a &quot;web service client view&quot;, which is used exclusively for JAX-WS and JAX-RPC.

Communication via web services is typical for clients not written in the Java programming language, but is also convenient for Java clients who have trouble reaching the EJB server via a firewall. Additionally, web service based communication can be used by Java clients to circumvent the arcane and ill-defined requirements for the so-called &quot;client-libraries&quot;; a set of jar files that a Java client must have on its class-path in order to communicate with the remote EJB server. These client-libraries potentially conflict with libraries the client may already have (for instance, if the client itself is also a full Java EE server) and such a conflict is deemed to be very hard or impossible to resolve.

=== Legacy ===

==== Home interfaces and required business interface ====

With EJB 2.1 and earlier, each EJB had to provide a Java implementation class and two Java interfaces. The EJB container created instances of the Java implementation class to provide the EJB implementation. The Java interfaces were used by client code of the EJB.

==== Required deployment descriptor ====
With EJB 2.1 and earlier, the EJB specification required a deployment descriptor to be present. This was needed to implement a mechanism that allowed EJBs to be deployed in a consistent manner regardless of the specific EJB platform that was chosen. Information about how the bean should be deployed (such as the name of the home or remote interfaces, whether and how to store the bean in a database, etc.) had to be specified in the deployment descriptor.

The deployment descriptor is an XML document having an entry for each EJB to be deployed. This XML document specifies the following information for each EJB:
* Name of the Home interface
* Java class for the Bean (business object)
* Java interface for the Home interface
* Java interface for the business object
* Persistent store (only for Entity Beans)
* Security roles and permissions
* Stateful or Stateless (for Session Beans)

Old EJB containers from many vendors required more deployment information than that in the EJB specification. They would require the additional information as separate XML files, or some other configuration file format. An EJB platform vendor generally provided their own tools that would read this deployment descriptor, and possibly generated a set of classes that would implement the now deprecated Home and Remote interfaces.

Since EJB 3.0 (JSR 220), the XML descriptor is replaced by Java annotations set in the Enterprise Bean implementation (at source level), although it is still possible to use an XML descriptor instead of (or in addition to) the annotations. If an XML descriptor and annotations are both applied to the same attribute within an Enterprise Bean, the XML definition overrides the corresponding source-level annotation, although some XML elements can also be additive (e.g., an activation-config-property in XML with a different name than already defined via an codice_14 annotation will be added instead of replacing all existing properties).

== Container variations ==
Starting with EJB 3.1, the EJB specification defines two variants of the EJB container; a full version and a limited version. The limited version adheres to a proper subset of the specification called EJB 3.1 Lite and is part of Java EE 6&#x27;s web profile (which is itself a subset of the full Java EE 6 specification).

EJB 3.1 Lite excludes support for the following features:
* Remote interfaces
* RMI-IIOP Interoperability
* JAX-WS Web Service Endpoints
* EJB Timer Service (codice_15, codice_16)
* Asynchronous session bean invocations (codice_17)
* Message-driven beans

EJB 3.2 Lite excludes less features. Particularly it no longer excludes codice_17 and codice_15/codice_16, but for codice_15 it does not support the &quot;persistent&quot; attribute that full EJB 3.2 does support. The complete excluded list for EJB 3.2 Lite is:
* Remote interfaces
* RMI-IIOP Interoperability
* JAX-WS Web Service Endpoints
* Persistent timers (&quot;persistent&quot; attribute on codice_15)
* Message-driven beans

== Version history ==

EJB 4.0, final release (2020-05-22)

Jakarta Enterprise Beans 4.0, as a part of Jakarta EE 9, was a tooling release that mainly moved API package names from the top level package to the top level package.

Other changes included removal of deprecated APIs that were pointless to move to the new top level package and the removal of features that depended on features that were removed from Java or elsewhere in Jakarta EE 9. The following APIs were removed:
* methods relying on which has been removed from Java 14.
* methods relying on Jakarta XML RPC to reflect the removal of XML RPC from the Jakarta EE 9 Platform.
* deprecated method.
* &quot;Support for Distributed Interoperability&quot; to reflect the removal of CORBA from Java 11 and the Jakarta EE 9 Platform.

Other minor changes include marking the Enterprise Beans 2.x API Group as &quot;Optional&quot; and making the annotation repeatable.

EJB 3.2.6, final release (2019-08-23)

Jakarta Enterprise Beans 3.2, as a part of Jakarta EE 8, and despite still using &quot;EJB&quot; abbreviation, this set of APIs has been officially renamed to &quot;Jakarta Enterprise Beans&quot; by the Eclipse Foundation so as not to tread on the Oracle &quot;Java&quot; trademark.

EJB 3.2, final release (2013-05-28)

JSR 345. Enterprise JavaBeans 3.2 was a relatively minor release that mainly contained specification clarifications and lifted some restrictions that were imposed by the spec but over time appeared to serve no real purpose. A few existing full EJB features were also demanded to be in EJB 3 lite and functionality that was proposed to be pruned in EJB 3.1 was indeed pruned (made optional).

The following features were added:
* Passivation of a stateful session bean can be deactivated via attribute on codice_23 annotation (passivationCapable = false)
* TimerService can retrieve all active timers in the same EJB module (could previously only retrieve timers for the bean in which the TimerService was called)
* Lifecycle methods (e.g. codice_24) can be transactional for stateful session beans using the existing codice_25 annotation
* Autocloseable interface implemented by embeddable container

EJB 3.1, final release (2009-12-10)

JSR 318. The purpose of the Enterprise JavaBeans 3.1 specification is to further simplify the EJB architecture by reducing its complexity from the developer&#x27;s point of view, while also adding new functionality in response to the needs of the community:
* Local view without interface (No-interface view)
* .war packaging of EJB components
* EJB Lite: definition of a subset of EJB
* Portable EJB Global JNDI Names
* Singletons (Singleton Session Beans)
* Application Initialization and Shutdown Events
* EJB Timer Service Enhancements
* Simple (codice_17 for session beans)

EJB 3.0, final release (2006-05-11)

JSR 220 - &quot;Major changes&quot;:
This release made it much easier to write EJBs, using &#x27;annotations&#x27; rather than the complex &#x27;deployment descriptors&#x27; used in version 2.x. The use of home and remote interfaces and the ejb-jar.xml file were also no longer required in this release, having been replaced with a business interface and a bean that implements the interface.

EJB 2.1, final release (2003-11-24)

JSR 153 - &quot;Major changes&quot;:
* Web service support (new): stateless session beans can be invoked over SOAP/HTTP. Also, an EJB can easily access a Web service using the new service reference.
* EJB timer service (new): Event-based mechanism for invoking EJBs at specific times.
* Message-driven beans accepts messages from sources other than JMS.
* Message destinations (the same idea as EJB references, resource references, etc.) has been added.
* EJB query language (EJB-QL) additions: ORDER BY, AVG, MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT, and MOD.
* XML schema is used to specify deployment descriptors, replaces DTDs

EJB 2.0, final release (2001-08-22)

JSR 19 - &quot;Major changes&quot;:
&quot;Overall goals&quot;:
* The standard component architecture for building &quot;distributed&quot; object-oriented business applications in Java.
* Make it possible to build distributed applications by combining components developed using tools from &quot;different vendors&quot;.
* Make it easy to write (enterprise) applications: Application developers will not have to understand low-level transaction and state management details, multi-threading, connection pooling, and other complex low-level APIs.
* Will follow the &quot;Write Once, Run Anywhere&quot; philosophy of Java. An enterprise Bean can be developed once, and then deployed on multiple platforms without recompilation or source code modification.
* Address the development, deployment, and runtime aspects of an enterprise application’s life cycle.
* Define the contracts that enable tools from multiple vendors to develop and deploy components that can interoperate at runtime.
* Be compatible with existing server platforms. Vendors will be able to extend their existing products to support EJBs.
* Be compatible with other Java APIs.
* Provide interoperability between enterprise Beans and Java EE components as well as non-Java programming language applications.
* Be compatible with the CORBA protocols (RMI-IIOP).

EJB 1.1, final release (1999-12-17)

&quot;Major changes&quot;:
* XML deployment descriptors
* Default JNDI contexts
* RMI over IIOP
* Security - role driven, not method driven
* Entity Bean support - mandatory, not optional

&quot;Goals&quot; for Release 1.1:
* Provide better support for application assembly and deployment.
* Specify in greater detail the responsibilities of the individual EJB roles.

EJB 1.0 (1998-03-24)

Announced at JavaOne 1998, Sun&#x27;s third Java developers conference (March 24 through 27)
&quot;Goals&quot; for Release 1.0:
* Defined the distinct &quot;EJB Roles&quot; that are assumed by the component architecture.
* Defined the client view of enterprise Beans.
* Defined the enterprise Bean developer’s view.
* Defined the responsibilities of an EJB Container provider and server provider; together these make up a system that supports the deployment and execution of enterprise Beans.

<text>Joseph Michael Straczynski (; born July 17, 1954) is an American filmmaker and comic book writer. He is the founder of Synthetic Worlds Ltd. and Studio JMS and is known as the creator of the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (1993–1998) and its spinoff &quot;Crusade&quot; (1999), as well as the series &quot;Jeremiah&quot; (2002–2004) and &quot;Sense8&quot; (2015–2018). He is the executor of the estate of Harlan Ellison.

Straczynski wrote the psychological drama film &quot;Changeling&quot; (2008) and was co-writer on the martial arts thriller &quot;Ninja Assassin&quot; (2009), was one of the key writers for (and had a cameo in) Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Thor&quot; (2011), as well as the horror film &quot;&quot; (2012), and the apocalyptic horror film &quot;World War Z&quot; (2013). From 2001 to 2007, Straczynski wrote Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, followed by runs on &quot;Thor&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. He is the author of the &quot;&quot; trilogy of graphic novels, and he has written &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, and &quot;Before Watchmen&quot; for DC Comics. Straczynski is the creator and writer of several original comic book series such as &quot;Rising Stars&quot;, &quot;Midnight Nation&quot;, &quot;Dream Police&quot;, and &quot;Ten Grand&quot; through Joe&#x27;s Comics.

A prolific writer across a variety of media and former journalist, Straczynski is the author of the autobiography &quot;Becoming Superman&quot; (2019) for HarperVoyager, the novel &quot;Together We Will Go&quot; (2021) for Simon &amp; Schuster, and &quot;Becoming a Writer, Staying a Writer&quot; (2021) for Benbella Books. In 2020 he was named Head of the Creative Council for the comics publishing company Artists, Writers and Artisans.

Straczynski is a long-time participant in Usenet and other early computer networks, interacting with fans through various online forums (including GEnie, CompuServe, and America Online) since 1984. He is credited as being the first TV producer to directly engage with fans on the Internet and to allow viewer viewpoints to influence the look and feel of his show (see &quot;Babylon 5&quot;″s use of the Internet). Two prominent areas where he had a presence were GEnie and the newsgroup rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated.

==Early and personal life==
Straczynski was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and is the son of Charles Straczynski, a manual laborer, and Evelyn Straczynski (née Pate). He was raised in Newark, New Jersey; Kankakee, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Chula Vista, California, where he graduated from high school; and San Diego, California. Straczynski&#x27;s family religion was Catholic although he is an atheist. He has Polish ancestry and his grandparents lived in the area which today belongs to Belarus and fled to the United States from the Russian Revolution; his father was born in the United States and has lived in Poland, Germany and Russia.

Straczynski began his postsecondary education at Southwestern College, where he was mentored by Bill Virchis and received an Associate of Arts degree. (Additionally, the two-year institution later awarded him an honorary degree.) Thereafter, he transferred to nearby San Diego State University (SDSU), where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree with a double major in psychology and sociology (and minors in philosophy and literature). While at SDSU, he wrote for the student newspaper, &quot;The Daily Aztec&quot;.

Straczynski met Kathryn M. Drennan while they were at SDSU. They moved to Los Angeles in 1981 (where he still resides), married in 1983, separated in 1999, and they were divorced in 2001. Sometime after his separation from Drennan, Straczynski entered into a relationship with Patricia Tallman, whom he had met when she was acting in his 1990s series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. She served as CEO and executive producer of Studio JMS in partnership with him; both their relationship and partnership ended in 2013.

Straczynski has Asperger syndrome. Straczynski had a voluntary vasectomy when he turned 21, and wrote about the experience in the January 28, 1983 edition of the &quot;Los Angeles Reader&quot;.

== Career ==

=== 1970s–1980s ===

==== Early work ====
Straczynski began writing plays, having several produced at Southwestern College and San Diego State University before publishing his adaptation of &quot;Snow White&quot; with Performance Publishing. Several other plays were produced around San Diego, including &quot;The Apprenticeship&quot; for the Marquis Public Theater. During the late 1970s, Straczynski became the on-air entertainment reviewer for KSDO-FM and wrote several radio plays before being hired as a scriptwriter for the radio drama &quot;Alien Worlds&quot;. He produced his first television project in San Diego, &quot;Marty Sprinkle&quot; for KPBS-TV as well as worked on the XETV-TV project &quot;Disasterpiece Theatre&quot;. He worked as a journalist for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as a special San Diego correspondent and worked for &quot;San Diego Magazine&quot; and &quot;The San Diego Reader&quot;, and wrote for the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Reader, TV-Cable Week,&quot; and &quot;&quot;People&quot;&quot; magazine. Straczynski wrote &quot;The Complete Book of Scriptwriting&quot; for &quot;Writer&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Published in 1982, the book is often used as a text in introductory screenwriting courses, and is in its third edition.

He spent five years from 1987 to 1992 co-hosting the &quot;Hour 25&quot; radio talk show on KPFK-FM Los Angeles with Larry DiTillio. During his tenure, he interviewed John Carpenter, Neil Gaiman, Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison and other writers, producers, actors and directors. In 2000, Straczynski returned to radio drama with &quot;The City of Dreams&quot; for scifi.com. Straczynski is the author of three horror novels—&quot;Demon Night&quot;, &quot;Othersyde&quot;, and &quot;Tribulations&quot;—and nearly twenty short stories, many of which are collected in two compilations—&quot;Tales from the New Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Straczynski Unplugged&quot;.

==== Work in animation ====
Straczynski was a fan of the cartoon &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;. He wrote a spec script in 1984 and sent it directly to Filmation. Filmation purchased his script and several others, and hired him on staff. During this time he became friends with Larry DiTillio, and when Filmation produced the &quot;He-Man&quot; spinoff &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;, they worked as story editors on the show. However, when Filmation refused to give them credit on-screen, both left, finding work with DIC on &quot;Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors&quot;.

Straczynski and DiTillio worked to create an animated version of &quot;Elfquest&quot;, but that project fell through when CBS attempted to retool the show to appeal to younger audiences.

While working on &quot;Jayce&quot;, Straczynski was hired to come aboard the Len Janson and Chuck Menville project to adapt the movie &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; to an animated version called &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;. When Janson and Menville learned that there was not only a 13-episode order but a 65-episode syndication order as well, they decided that the workload was too much and that they would only work on their own scripts. DIC head Jean Chalopin asked Straczynski to take on the task of story editing the entire 78-episode block as well as writing his own scripts. After the show&#x27;s successful first season, consultants were brought in to make suggestions for the show, including changing Janine to a more maternal character, giving every character a particular &quot;job&quot; (Peter is the funny one, Egon is the smart one, and Winston, the only black character, was to be the driver), and to add kids into the show. Straczynski left at this point, Janson and Menville resuming the story editing job for the second network season. Straczynski then began development on a show called &quot;Spiral Zone&quot; but left after only one script, taking his name off the series, because management drastically altered his conception of show. substituting the pseudonym &quot;Fettes Grey&quot; (derived from the names of the grave robbers in &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot;).

Straczynski wrote for &quot;CBS Storybreak&quot;, writing an adaptation of Evelyn Sibley Lampman&#x27;s &quot;The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek&quot;.

==== Live action and network shows ====
After leaving animation, Straczynski freelanced for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; writing an episode entitled &quot;What Are Friends For&quot; and, for Shelley Duvall&#x27;s &quot;Nightmare Classics&quot;, adapting &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, which was nominated for a Writer&#x27;s Guild Award.

Straczynski was offered the position of story editor on the syndicated live-action science fiction series &quot;Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future&quot;. Straczynski constructed a season long arc with lasting character changes and wrote a third of the scripts himself. After one season, the toy company Mattel demanded more input into the show, causing Straczynski to quit. He recommended DiTillio to take over the job as story editor for a second season, but the toy company financing fell through and that season was never produced.

Soon after, the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike began. Straczynski met Harlan Ellison during this time and later became friends with him. Straczynski is an executor of Ellison&#x27;s collected works.

After the strike ended, the producers of the new &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; needed to create more episodes to be able to sell the series into syndication with a complete 65-episode package. They hired Straczynski as executive story editor to fill in the remaining number of needed episodes. Straczynski wrote many of the scripts himself. In addition, one episode, &quot;Crazy as a Soup Sandwich&quot;, was written by Ellison.

After leaving &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, his agent of the time asked him to pitch for the show &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot;. Initially wary, Straczynski finally did and was hired on as an executive story consultant under Jeri Taylor and David Moessinger. When Taylor and Moessinger left the show, Straczynski left too as an act of solidarity.

When Moessinger was hired as executive producer for &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, he offered Straczynski a job as co-producer. Straczynski joined &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; for two seasons and wrote seven produced episodes. Moessinger and Straczynski moved the protagonist, Jessica Fletcher, from the sleepy Maine town of Cabot Cove to New York City to revitalize the show. The move effectively brought the show back into the top ten from the mid-thirties where it had fallen. Straczynski made Jessica an instructor in writing and criminology, and he emphasized her role as a working writer, with all the deadlines and problems involved in that profession.

Straczynski wrote one episode of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; for Moessinger between the pilot episode for &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and the start of its first season.

Straczynski wrote an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; for the Showtime network, which was nominated for a Writers Guild of America award, and a &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; movie, &quot;Murder, She Wrote: A Story to Die For&quot;, which he produced.

=== 1990s ===

==== &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and &quot;Crusade&quot; ====
In late 1991, Warner Bros. contracted with Straczynski and Doug Netter as partners to produce &quot;Babylon 5&quot; as the flagship program for the new Prime Time Entertainment Network.

Straczynski and Netter hired many of the people from &quot;Captain Power&quot;, as well as hiring Ellison as a consultant and DiTillio as a story editor. &quot;Babylon 5&quot; won two Emmy Awards, back-to-back Hugo Awards, and dozens of other awards. Straczynski wrote 92 of the 110 episodes, as well as the pilot and five television movies. The show is a character-driven space opera and features an intentional emphasis on realism in its portrayal of space operations. It pioneered extensive use of CGI for its special effects. &quot;Babylon 5&quot; was produced and broadcast for five seasons completing Stracynski&#x27;s planned story arc. Its sequel, &quot;Crusade&quot;, was produced for the TNT Network, however it ended with only 13 episodes. Production was halted before the first episode aired.

He wrote the outlines for nine of the canonical &quot;Babylon 5&quot; novels, supervised the three produced &quot;Babylon 5&quot; telefilm novelizations (&quot;In the Beginning&quot;, &quot;Thirdspace&quot;, and &quot;A Call to Arms&quot;), and is the author of four &quot;Babylon 5&quot; short stories published in magazines, not yet reprinted ().

In 2005, Straczynski began publishing his &quot;Babylon 5&quot; scripts. This process ended in June 2008, with the scripts no longer being available from the end of July of that year. His scripts for the television movies were published for a limited time in January 2009.

Straczynski wrote and produced the pilot &quot;Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers&quot;, a pilot for the SciFi Network, and wrote, directed and produced &quot;Babylon 5: The Lost Tales&quot; as a two-hour direct-to-DVD movie.

==== Joe&#x27;s Comics ====
Straczynski has long been a comic fan and began writing comics in the late 1980s. His work in comics includes the adaptations of &quot;Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. In 1999 he created &quot;Rising Stars&quot; for Top Cow/Image Comics. Eventually he worked mostly under his own imprint – Joe&#x27;s Comics – for which he wrote the &quot;Midnight Nation&quot; miniseries and the illustrated fantasy parable &quot;Delicate Creatures&quot;.

=== 2000s ===

==== Marvel Comics ====
Marvel Comics signed him to an exclusive contract, beginning with a run on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, from 2001 to 2007. He took over the series with Volume 2 issue #30 (cover dated June 2001). Straczynski and artist John Romita Jr. crafted an acclaimed story for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #36 (Dec. 2001) in response to the September 11 attacks. He wrote or co-wrote several major Spider-Man story arcs including &quot;Spider-Man: The Other&quot;, &quot;Back in Black&quot;, and the infamous &quot;One More Day&quot;. He later wrote several other Marvel titles including &quot;Supreme Power&quot;, &quot;Strange&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;Thor&quot;, and mini-series featuring the Silver Surfer and a &quot;What If&quot; scenario, &quot;Bullet Points&quot;.

==== &quot;Jeremiah&quot; ====
Straczynski ran &quot;Jeremiah&quot;, loosely based on the Belgian post-apocalyptic comic &quot;Jeremiah&quot;, from 2002–2004. Straczynski ran the series for two seasons but was frustrated with the conflicting directions that MGM and Showtime wanted from the show, and even used the pseudonym &quot;Fettes Grey&quot; for the first time since &quot;Spiral Zone&quot; on one of the scripts. In the second season, Straczynski decided to leave the show if things did not improve, and the show ended after two seasons.

==== &quot;Changeling&quot; ====
Straczynski wrote &quot;Changeling&quot;, a psychological drama film based partly on the &quot;Wineville Chicken Coop&quot; kidnapping and murder case in Los Angeles, California. Directed by Clint Eastwood, produced by Ron Howard, and starring Angelina Jolie, the film premiered in 2008 and subsequently received eight nominations for the BAFTA Award, including a nomination for Best Original Screenplay. The first draft script was written in eleven days, after Straczynski figured out &quot;how to tell&quot; the story, which ended up being the shooting draft, after Eastwood declined to make any changes. It was optioned immediately by Howard, who at first intended to direct the film but later stepped down after scheduling conflicts.

At first, Straczynski expressed disbelief at the story, but spent a year researching the case, compiling over six thousands pages of documentation. Straczynski claimed that 95% of the script&#x27;s content came from the historical record, and went through the script with Universal Studios&#x27;s legal department, providing attribution for every scene so the film would be described as &quot;a true story&quot; rather than &quot;based on&quot; one. On how his journalistic background helped him write the film, Straczynski stated:

==== Feature screenwriter ====
Straczynski announced on February 23, 2007, that he had been hired to write the feature film adaptation of Max Brooks&#x27;s novel &quot;World War Z&quot; for Paramount Pictures and production company Plan B Entertainment, taking screen story credit on the finished film.

In 2008, Straczynski wrote a draft of &quot;Ninja Assassin&quot; for Joel Silver, which he completed in just 53 hours. The film was produced by The Wachowskis and released on November 25, 2009.

Straczynski is credited as &quot;story writer&quot; along with Mark Protosevich for the 2011 film, &quot;Thor&quot;. He makes a cameo appearance in the film, his first appearance in a movie and his second appearance as an actor (the first being &quot;Sleeping in Light&quot;, the final episode of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;). Straczynski was part of the writers room (along with Terry Rossio, Patrick McKay, J. D. Payne, Lindsey Beer, Cat Vasko, T.S. Nowlin, and Jack Paglen) to develop &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, though was uncredited on the final script.

==== DC Comics ====
When his exclusive contract with Marvel ended, he was announced as the writer for a run on &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; for DC Comics. He collaborated with artist Shane Davis on an out-of-continuity original graphic novel starring Superman titled &quot;&quot;. The story features a young Superman and focus on his decision about the role he wants to assume in life. On March 8, 2010, it was announced he would be taking over writing duties for the monthly &quot;Superman&quot; title with a story arc entitled &quot;&quot;, and the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; title, beginning with issues 701 and 601 respectively. Less than a year later he was asked by DC to step away from both titles in order to concentrate on the second volume of &quot;Superman: Earth One&quot; and handed them over to Chris Roberson and Phil Hester to finish his Superman and Wonder Woman stories respectively. In 2012, Straczynski wrote &quot;Before Watchmen: Dr. Manhattan&quot; drawn by Adam Hughes and &quot;Before Watchmen: Nite Owl&quot; drawn by Andy Kubert and Joe Kubert. A second volume of &quot;Superman: Earth One&quot; was released later that same year.

At San Diego Comic-Con in 2015, DC Comics announced &quot;The Flash: Earth One&quot;, a new graphic novel of its Earth One line to be written by Straczynski, set to be published in 2016. As of 2023, it has still not been published. 

=== 2010s ===
=== Studio JMS ===
In July 2012, J. Michael Straczynski announced the launch of Studio JMS to produce TV series, movies, comics and, in the future, games and web series. On March 27, 2013, Netflix announced they would produce the show &quot;Sense8&quot; with Studio JMS and The Wachowskis, which aired on June 5, 2015, and earned a season 2 announcement by August 10, 2015.

==== Joe&#x27;s Comics revival ====
The Joe&#x27;s Comics line was revived at Image Comics in 2013 with the launch of &quot;Ten Grand&quot; drawn by Ben Templesmith and &quot;Sidekick&quot; drawn by Tom Mandrake.

Dynamite Entertainment announced in July 2013 a new 12 issue &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; comic book series penned by Straczynski. The series ran for its projected 12 issues, from December 2013 to February 2015, with art by Guiu Vilanova. Straczynski was announced as the writer of &quot;Terminator Salvation: The Final Battle&quot;, a 12 issue comic book series from Dark Horse Comics, along with artist Pete Woods.

==== &quot;Sense8&quot; ====
&quot;Sense8&quot;, a science fiction television series created by Straczynski and The Wachowskis was ordered straight-to-series by Netflix in March 2013. &quot;Sense8&quot;&#x27;s first season debuted in June 2015 on Netflix, from Studio JMS and Georgeville Television. Straczynski executive produced and co-wrote all 12 episodes of the first season with fellow creators, executive producers, and directors Lilly and Lana Wachowski. In August 2015, Netflix renewed &quot;Sense8&quot; for a second season.

=== 2020s ===

==== Artists Writers and Artisans ====
In 2020, Straczynski was named head of the Creative Council for the new comics publishing company AWA, where he was responsible for creating the shared universe used by many of its writers.

Following the publication of his autobiography &quot;Becoming Superman&quot; in 2019 from HarperVoyager, the novel &quot;Together We Will Go&quot; was published in 2021 by Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s Scout Press, and &quot;Becoming A Writer, Staying A Writer&quot; was published in 2021 by Benbella Books.

===Return to &quot;Babylon 5&quot;===
In 2022, Straczynski announced that a reboot of his series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; was in the works at The CW, with the pilot script written by him. Following a buy-out of the CW by NextStar and strike action by the WGA, work on the project was stalled.

In 2023, it was announced by Straczynski that a fully animated &quot;Babylon 5&quot; feature film, &quot;Babylon 5: The Road Home&quot;, had been produced in secret and was scheduled for release in the summer of that year, reunited the surviving members of the original cast. It was released in August 2023.

===Return to Marvel Comics===
Across 2021 and 2022, Straczynski contributed short stories to several anthology and milestone editions of comics published by Marvel Comics, this led to him writing a mystery six issue event mini-series for the publisher. In June 2023, it was announced Straczynski would write the next volume of &quot;Captain America&quot;, beginning in September of that year. Straczynski also returned to the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; franchise around this time, contributing a short story to the anthology mini-series &quot;Spider-Man: Black Suit &amp; Blood&quot; as well as penning guest appearances by the character in storylines for &quot;Captain America&quot;.

In October of 2024, Straczynski confirmed on social media that he would be departing &quot;Captain America&quot; in December of that year, while the mystery six-part event announced some years back was ultimately revealed that same month as being an anthology series pairing up two different &#x27;unlikely&#x27; Marvel characters per issue.

== Unrealized projects ==
In 2004, Straczynski was approached by Paramount Studios to become a producer of the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; series. He declined, believing that he would not be allowed to take the show in the direction he felt it should go. He did write a treatment for a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series with colleague Bryce Zabel.

After both &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and &quot;Jeremiah&quot; ended, Straczynski transitioned to working as a feature film screenwriter. In 2006, he was hired to write a feature film based on the story of King David for Universal by producers Erwin Stoff and Akiva Goldsman. In June 2007, it was announced that Straczynski had written a feature screenplay for the &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; movie for Fox, the production of which would depend on the success of the &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot;. Additionally, he has written a script for Tom Hanks&#x27; Playtone Productions and Universal Pictures called &quot;They Marched into Sunlight&quot; based upon the Pulitzer nominated novel of the same name and an outline by Paul Greengrass, for Greengrass to direct, should it get a greenlight.

In June 2008, &quot;Daily Variety&quot; named Straczynski one of the top Ten Screenwriters to Watch. They announced Straczynski was writing &quot;Lensman&quot; for Ron Howard (to whom he had sold a screenplay entitled &quot;The Flickering Light&quot;), that he was selling another spec, &quot;Proving Ground&quot;, to Tom Cruise and United Artists. In October 2008, it was announced that Straczynski was engaged to pen a remake of the science fiction classic &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. In the fall of 2009, it was reported that Straczynski was writing a movie titled &quot;Shattered Union&quot; for Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney. The screenplay, based on the video game of that name, concerns itself with a present-day American civil war.

In October 2012, Valiant Entertainment announced a live-action feature film adaptation on its comic book series &quot;Shadowman&quot;, written and executive produced by Straczynski. &quot;The Flickering Light&quot;, Straczynski&#x27;s directorial debut, was announced in February 2013, with the World War II drama set to be written and produced by Straczynski through his Studio JMS. Straczynski and Studio JMS optioned Harlan Ellison&#x27;s short story &quot;Repent, Harlequin!&quot; Said the Ticktockman, who granted the option only after reading a finished screenplay written by Straczynski.

At San Diego Comic-Con in 2014, it was announced that Straczynski and Graphic India would team up with Chernin Entertainment to produce a feature film adaptation of his upcoming graphic novel &quot;Titans&quot;, to be written and produced by Straczynski, through Studio JMS.

Straczynski was hired to adapt &quot;Red Mars&quot; for Spike TV, based on the Kim Stanley Robinson novels, with Vince Gerardis as producer. In December 2015, Spike TV gave a 10-episode straight-to-series order to &quot;Red Mars&quot;, set to premiere in January 2017, with Straczynski serving as writer, executive producer, and showrunner through Studio JMS, and production set to begin in Summer 2016. On March 25, 2016 &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Straczynski had left his position as showrunner with Peter Noah replacing him but he too left due to creative differences with Spike. Spike has put the series on hold for further development.

On July 30, 2021, Straczynski expressed an interest in becoming showrunner of the BBC Television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, following the departure of Chris Chibnall, confirming his representatives had been contacting the BBC. On August 19, Straczynski confirmed contact had been made with the BBC, but that the organization had already begun their own selection process and were not seeking new candidates. On September 24, 2021, the BBC confirmed former showrunner Russell T Davies would return, which Straczynski commended.

<text>Sonoluminescence is the emission of light from imploding bubbles in a liquid when excited by sound.

Sonoluminescence was first discovered in 1934 at the University of Cologne. It occurs when a sound wave of sufficient intensity induces a gaseous cavity within a liquid to collapse quickly, emitting a burst of light. The phenomenon can be observed in stable single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) and multi-bubble sonoluminescence (MBSL). In 1960, Peter Jarman proposed that sonoluminescence is thermal in origin and might arise from microshocks within collapsing cavities. Later experiments revealed that the temperature inside the bubble during SBSL could reach up to . The exact mechanism behind sonoluminescence remains unknown, with various hypotheses including hotspot, &quot;bremsstrahlung&quot;, and collision-induced radiation. Some researchers have even speculated that temperatures in sonoluminescing systems could reach millions of kelvins, potentially causing thermonuclear fusion; this idea, however, has been met with skepticism by other researchers. The phenomenon has also been observed in nature, with the pistol shrimp being the first known instance of an animal producing light through sonoluminescence.

==History==
The sonoluminescence effect was first discovered at the University of Cologne in 1934 as a result of work on sonar. Hermann Frenzel and H. Schultes put an ultrasound transducer in a tank of photographic developer fluid. They hoped to speed up the development process. Instead, they noticed tiny dots on the film after developing and realized that the bubbles in the fluid were emitting light with the ultrasound turned on. It was too difficult to analyze the effect in early experiments because of the complex environment of a large number of short-lived bubbles. This phenomenon is now referred to as multi-bubble sonoluminescence (MBSL).

In 1960, Peter Jarman from Imperial College of London proposed the most reliable theory of sonoluminescence phenomenon. He concluded that sonoluminescence is basically thermal in origin and that it might possibly arise from microshocks with the collapsing cavities.

In 1990, an experimental advance was reported by Gaitan and Crum, who produced stable single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL). In SBSL, a single bubble trapped in an acoustic standing wave emits a pulse of light with each compression of the bubble within the standing wave. This technique allowed a more systematic study of the phenomenon because it isolated the complex effects into one stable, predictable bubble. It was realized that the temperature inside the bubble was hot enough to melt steel, as seen in an experiment done in 2012; the temperature inside the bubble as it collapsed reached about . Interest in sonoluminescence was renewed when an inner temperature of such a bubble well above was postulated. This temperature is thus far not conclusively proven; rather, recent experiments indicate temperatures around .

==Properties==
Sonoluminescence can occur when a sound wave of sufficient intensity induces a gaseous cavity within a liquid to collapse quickly. This cavity may take the form of a preexisting bubble or may be generated through a process known as cavitation. Sonoluminescence in the laboratory can be made to be stable so that a single bubble will expand and collapse over and over again in a periodic fashion, emitting a burst of light each time it collapses. For this to occur, a standing acoustic wave is set up within a liquid, and the bubble will sit at a pressure antinode of the standing wave. The frequencies of resonance depend on the shape and size of the container in which the bubble is contained.

Some facts about sonoluminescence:
* The light that flashes from the bubbles last between 35 and a few hundred picoseconds long, with peak intensities of the order of .
* The bubbles are very small when they emit light—about in diameter—depending on the ambient fluid (e.g., water) and the gas content of the bubble (e.g., atmospheric air).
* SBSL pulses can have very stable periods and positions. In fact, the frequency of light flashes can be more stable than the rated frequency stability of the oscillator making the sound waves driving them. The stability analyses of the bubble, however, show that the bubble itself undergoes significant geometric instabilities due to, for example, the Bjerknes forces and Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities.
* The addition of a small amount of noble gas (such as helium, argon, or xenon) to the gas in the bubble increases the intensity of the emitted light.

Spectral measurements have given bubble temperatures in the range from , the exact temperatures depending on experimental conditions including the composition of the liquid and gas. Detection of very high bubble temperatures by spectral methods is limited due to the opacity of liquids to short wavelength light characteristic of very high temperatures.

A study describes a method of determining temperatures based on the formation of plasmas. Using argon bubbles in sulfuric acid, the data shows the presence of ionized molecular oxygen , sulfur monoxide, and atomic argon populating high-energy excited states, which confirms a hypothesis that the bubbles have a hot plasma core. The ionization and excitation energy of dioxygenyl cations, which they observed, is . From this observation, they conclude the core temperatures reach at least —hotter than the surface of the Sun.

==Rayleigh–Plesset equation==
The dynamics of the motion of the bubble is characterized to a first approximation by the Rayleigh–Plesset equation (named after Lord Rayleigh and Milton Plesset):

:formula_1

This is an approximate equation that is derived from the Navier–Stokes equations (written in spherical coordinate system) and describes the motion of the radius of the bubble &quot;R&quot; as a function of time &quot;t&quot;. Here, &quot;μ&quot; is the viscosity, &quot;formula_2&quot; is the external pressure infinitely far from the bubble, &quot;formula_3&quot; is the internal pressure of the bubble, formula_4 is the liquid density, and &quot;γ&quot; is the surface tension. The over-dots represent time derivatives. This equation, though approximate, has been shown to give good estimates on the motion of the bubble under the acoustically driven field except during the final stages of collapse. Both simulation and experimental measurement show that during the critical final stages of collapse, the bubble wall velocity exceeds the speed of sound of the gas inside the bubble. Thus a more detailed analysis of the bubble&#x27;s motion is needed beyond Rayleigh–Plesset to explore the additional energy focusing that an internally formed shock wave might produce. In the static case, the Rayleigh-Plesset equation simplifies, yielding the Young–Laplace equation.

==Mechanism of phenomena==

The mechanism of the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is unknown. Hypotheses include: hotspot, bremsstrahlung radiation, collision-induced radiation and corona discharges, nonclassical light, proton tunneling, electrodynamic jets and fractoluminescent jets (now largely discredited due to contrary experimental evidence). 

In 2002, M. Brenner, S. Hilgenfeldt, and D. Lohse published a 60-page review that contains a detailed explanation of the mechanism. An important factor is that the bubble contains mainly inert noble gas such as argon or xenon (air contains about 1% argon, and the amount dissolved in water is too great; for sonoluminescence to occur, the concentration must be reduced to 20–40% of its equilibrium value) and varying amounts of water vapor. Chemical reactions cause nitrogen and oxygen to be removed from the bubble after about one hundred expansion-collapse cycles. The bubble will then begin to emit light. The light emission of highly compressed noble gas is exploited technologically in the argon flash devices.

During bubble collapse, the inertia of the surrounding water causes high pressure and high temperature, reaching around 10,000 kelvins in the interior of the bubble, causing the ionization of a small fraction of the noble gas present. The amount ionized is small enough for the bubble to remain transparent, allowing volume emission; surface emission would produce more intense light of longer duration, dependent on wavelength, contradicting experimental results. Electrons from ionized atoms interact mainly with neutral atoms, causing thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. As the wave hits a low energy trough, the pressure drops, allowing electrons to recombine with atoms and light emission to cease due to this lack of free electrons. This makes for a 160-picosecond light pulse for argon (even a small drop in temperature causes a large drop in ionization, due to the large ionization energy relative to photon energy). This description is simplified from the literature above, which details various steps of differing duration from 15 microseconds (expansion) to 100 picoseconds (emission).

Computations based on the theory presented in the review produce radiation parameters (intensity and duration time versus wavelength) that match experimental results with errors no larger than expected due to some simplifications (e.g., assuming a uniform temperature in the entire bubble), so it seems the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is at least roughly explained, although some details of the process remain obscure.

Any discussion of sonoluminescence must include a detailed analysis of metastability. Sonoluminescence in this respect is what is physically termed a bounded phenomenon meaning that the sonoluminescence exists in a bounded region of parameter space for the bubble; a coupled magnetic field being one such parameter. The magnetic aspects of sonoluminescence are very well documented.

===Other proposals===

====Quantum explanations====
An unusually exotic hypothesis of sonoluminescence, which has received much popular attention, is the Casimir energy hypothesis suggested by noted physicist Julian Schwinger and more thoroughly considered in a paper by Claudia Eberlein of the University of Sussex. Eberlein&#x27;s paper suggests that the light in sonoluminescence is generated by the vacuum within the bubble in a process similar to Hawking radiation, the radiation generated at the event horizon of black holes. According to this vacuum energy explanation, since quantum theory holds that vacuum contains virtual particles, the rapidly moving interface between water and gas converts virtual photons into real photons. This is related to the Unruh effect or the Casimir effect. The argument has been made that sonoluminescence releases too large an amount of energy and releases the energy on too short a time scale to be consistent with the vacuum energy explanation, although other credible sources argue the vacuum energy explanation might yet prove to be correct.

====Nuclear reactions====

Some have argued that the Rayleigh–Plesset equation described above is unreliable for predicting bubble temperatures and that actual temperatures in sonoluminescing systems can be far higher than 20,000 kelvins. Some research claims to have measured temperatures as high as 100,000 kelvins and speculates temperatures could reach into the millions of kelvins. Temperatures this high could cause thermonuclear fusion. This possibility is sometimes referred to as bubble fusion and is likened to the implosion design used in the fusion component of thermonuclear weapons.

Experiments in 2002 and 2005 by R. P. Taleyarkhan using deuterated acetone showed measurements of tritium and neutron output consistent with fusion. However, the papers were considered low quality and there were doubts cast by a report about the author&#x27;s scientific misconduct. This made the report lose credibility among the scientific community.

On January 27, 2006, researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute claimed to have produced fusion in sonoluminescence experiments.

==Biological sonoluminescence==

Pistol shrimp (also called &quot;snapping shrimp&quot;) produce a type of cavitation luminescence from a collapsing bubble caused by quickly snapping its claw. The animal snaps a specialized claw shut to create a cavitation bubble that generates acoustic pressures of up to 80 kPa at a distance of 4 cm from the claw. As it extends out from the claw, the bubble reaches speeds of 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) and releases a sound reaching 218 decibels. The pressure is strong enough to kill small fish. The light produced is of lower intensity than the light produced by typical sonoluminescence and is not visible to the naked eye. The light and heat produced by the bubble may have no direct significance, as it is the shockwave produced by the rapidly collapsing bubble which these shrimp use to stun or kill prey. However, it is the first known instance of an animal producing light by this effect and was whimsically dubbed &quot;shrimpoluminescence&quot; upon its discovery in 2001. It has subsequently been discovered that another group of crustaceans, the mantis shrimp, contains species whose club-like forelimbs can strike so quickly and with such force as to induce sonoluminescent cavitation bubbles upon impact.

A mechanical device with 3D printed snapper claw at five times the actual size was also reported to emit light in a similar fashion, this bioinspired design was based on the snapping shrimp snapper claw molt shed from an &quot;Alpheus formosus&quot;, the striped snapping shrimp.

<text>The University of Cologne () is a university in Cologne, Germany. It was established in 1388. It closed in 1798 before being re-established in 1919. It is now one of the largest universities in Germany with around 44,000 students. The University of Cologne is a member of the German U15 association of major research-intensive universities and was a university of excellence as part of the German Universities Excellence Initiative from 2012 to 2019. It is constantly ranked among top 20 German universities in the world rankings. 

The University of Cologne has 4 Clusters of Excellence; CECAD Cluster of Excellence for Aging Research, Cluster of Excellence ECONtribute: Markets &amp; Public Policy, CEPLAS Cluster of Excellence for Plant Sciences and Cluster of Excellence Matter and Light for Quantum Information (ML4Q). As of 2022, among its notable alumni, faculty and researchers are 4 Nobel Laureates, 11 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners, 7 Humboldt Professorship winners, 2 Humboldt Research Awards winners and 1 Rhodes Scholar.

==History==
===1388–1798===
The university of Cologne was established in 1388 as the fourth university in the Holy Roman Empire, after the Charles University of Prague (1348), the University of Vienna (1365) and the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg (1386). The charter was signed by Pope Urban VI. The university began teaching on 6 January 1389, and operated for several hundred years.

In 1798, the university was abolished by the French First Republic, who had invaded Cologne in 1794, because under the new French constitution, many universities were abolished all over France. The last rector Ferdinand Franz Wallraf was able to preserve the university&#x27;s Great Seal, now once more in use.

===1919–today===

In 1919, the Prussian government endorsed a decision by the Cologne City Council to re-establish the university. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the University of Strasbourg on the west bank of the Rhine, which contemporaneously reverted to France with the rest of Alsace. On 29 May 1919, the Cologne Mayor Konrad Adenauer signed the charter of the new university.

At that point, the new university was located in Neustadt-Süd, but relocated to its current campus in Lindenthal on 2 November 1934. The old premises are now being used for the Cologne University of Applied Sciences.

Initially, the university was composed of the Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences (successor to the Institutes of Commerce and of Communal and Social Administration) and the Faculty of Medicine (successor to the Academy of Medicine). In 1920, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Arts were added, from which the School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was separated in 1955 to form an independent Faculty. In 1980, the two Cologne departments of the Rhineland School of Education were attached to the university as the Faculties of Education and of Special Education. In 1988, the university became a founding member of the Community of European Management Schools and International Companies (CEMS), today&#x27;s Global Alliance in Management Education.

The university is a leader in the area of economics and is regularly ranked at the top of national and international law and business rankings.

==Organization==

The University of Cologne is a statutory corporation (Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts), operated by the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia.

===Faculties===
The university is divided into six Faculties, which together offer 200 fields of study. The Faculties are those of Management, Economics and Social Sciences, Law, Medicine (with the affiliated University Hospital Cologne), Arts and Humanities, Mathematics and Natural Sciences and Human Sciences.

===Rectors===

On 10 May 2023, Joybrato Mukherjee was elected as Rector of the University.

==Profile==
The University of Cologne is a member of the association German U15 e.V., an association of fifteen major research-intensive and leading medical universities in Germany with a full disciplinary spectrum.

Especially the Faculties of law and economics are renowned and leading in Germany. Leading researchers are affiliated to Cologne, including Angelika Nußberger, Thomas von Danwitz, Claus Kreß, Martin Henssler, Ulrich Preis, Heinz-Peter Mansel.

Apart from these, affiliated persons with the university have won various awards, including the Max Planck Research Award, the Cologne Innovation Prize (City of Cologne), the Postbank Finance Award (Deutsche Postbank), the Ernst Jung Prize in Medicine (Jung Foundation), the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize, the Wilhelm Vaillant Prize (Wilhlem Vaillant Foundation), the Heinz Maier Leibnitz Prize (DFG), the Alfried Krupp Prize for the Advancement of Young Professors, the Innovation Prize of the State of NRW, and the Karl Arnold Prize (North Rhine-Westphalia Academy of Sciences and Arts).

Name

The university did not have a name for a long time, except for the medieval name &quot;universitas studii s[an]c[ta]e civitatis coloniensis&quot; (see university’s seal) or the new name &quot;Cologne University&quot;. Both names emphasize that the university was an institution of the &quot;city of Cologne&quot;. Josef Kroll, Rector of the university from 1945 to 1949, introduced the official name &quot;University of Cologne&quot;. Kroll had already taken the initiative in his first term of office in the early 1930s.

Organization and Faculties

The Rectorate is responsible for the governance and management of the university. It consists of the Rector as Chairperson (Joybrato Mukherjee), six Vice-Rectors and the Chancellor (Karsten Gerlof). The Rectorate is elected by the University Election Assembly, in which the Senate and the University Council exercise equal voting power; the first term of office is at least six years and subsequent terms of office at least four years. The Rector is Chairperson of the Rectorate and the Senate of the University.

The university is divided into the following six Faculties:

&quot;WS 2022/23, according to the university publication &#x27;Zahlen Daten Fakten 2022&quot;&#x27; &quot;(as of December 2022), main and part-time students, excluding doctoral students, incl. short-term students&quot;

On 20 July 2005, the University Senate approved a concept for the reorganization of the Faculties. The concept led to the dissolution of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Curative Education and the founding of a new ‘sixth’ Faculty, the &quot;Faculty of Human Sciences&quot;. The representatives of the didactic subjects, who had previously worked mainly at the Faculty of Education, were assigned to the Faculties corresponding to their subject as a separate subject group for didactics (for example &quot;Biology and its didactics&quot;, &quot;Chemistry and its didactics&quot; as a new didactic subject group at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences), while the new &quot;Faculty of Human Sciences&quot; mainly retained the pedagogical, curative education and psychology subjects or transferred them from the Faculty of Arts and Humanities and the Faculty of Education. The reorganization of the Faculties was officially implemented on 1 January 2007 with the establishment of the corresponding committees. In 2010, the Centre for Teacher Education was founded, which was given extensive responsibilities in the organization and coordination of teacher training degree programmes as part of the restructuring of teacher training in North Rhine-Westphalia.

Cologne University Foundation

The Cologne University Foundation was established in 2019 to promote early-career researchers, research and academic projects. The foundation manages private donations to the university, which promote the transfer of knowledge to society.

Third-party funding

The volume of third-party funding was 216.8 million euros in 2022, of which 90.6 million euros was allocated to the Faculty of Medicine. The German Research Foundation was by far the largest provider of third-party funding with 84.8 million euros and a share of 39 euros. Other third-party funders in 2022 were the EU (9.6 million euros), the federal government (40.5 million euros), the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (competition procedure totalling 19 million euros), foundations (19.2 million euros), industry (32.3 million euros) and other third-party funders (11.2 million euros).

Teaching

The University of Cologne is a research-orientated comprehensive university. With 337 degree components and programmes and 79 doctoral disciplines (in the winter semester 2022/23), the university offers a wide range of study and research opportunities. 157 of these degree programmes are undergraduate programmes (including the state examinations in medicine and dentistry and the first examination in law) and 181 are consecutive programmes. The teaching degree programmes make up a total of around 45%. The largest degree programmes are Law, Human Medicine and Business Administration.

In January 2022, the University of Cologne published its mission statement teaching and learning, which describes the university’s ambitions and serves as a basis for the further development of teaching and learning offers. Based on the mission statement for teaching and learning, the University of Cologne has developed a quality management system that involves and is shaped by all status groups. The University of Cologne is currently seeking system accreditation for its QM system. The Vice-Rectorate for Teaching and Studies is headed by Beatrix Busse.

Student representation

The students of the university are represented by student members in the various university committees, such as the Senate. These members are directly elected in annual elections or appointed by directly elected members from higher-level bodies. Due to the legal requirements of Section 11 subsection 2 of the Higher Education Act NRW, students do not form a majority in most committees and can be outvoted by professorial members and other status groups.

In contrast, the constituted student body is a statutory body under public law of the university and represents student interests. The central bodies are the student parliament with its 51 elected members and the student union (AStA) appointed by it as the executive body. The most important tasks of the student body are to represent the student interests in the university and society, to participate in the political discourse of the university and to promote culture, sport and political education. In order to fulfil these tasks, the student body levies a fee from the students, which is collected together with the fee for the Kölner Studierendenwerk as a course and tuition fee. In the winter semester 2023/24, this amounted to €320.05, of which 31% was allocated to the Studierendenwerk and 63% to the semester ticket; the AStA is responsible for negotiating the price of the semester ticket with the Kölner Verkehrs-Betriebe (KVB). The remaining 6% was distributed by the student body to its own projects and salaries as well as to University Sport Cologne. The AStA offers a wide range of services, including counselling and complaints offices, a bicycle repair shop, a tool rental service, the campus garden and countless cultural and informative events such as lectures, museum tours, the long study nights and the ‘festival contre le racisme’.

In addition to the general representation of student interests, the student body also has several autonomous departments such as the autonomous parents’ department or the autonomous internationals&#x27; department; these departments represent special status groups within the student body.

At faculty level, the student associations look after the interests of their respective students. Depending on the faculty, there is either joint student association for all students in the faculty or a two-tier system consisting of a departmental and a faculty representation. In addition to providing subject-specific advice and representing students’ interests to lecturers, providing support to first-semester students is one of the main tasks of the student associations.

Internationalization

The International Office is responsible for the university’s international relations (offering support for international students and visiting scholars and scientists, study and research opportunities abroad, university partnerships, international marketing) at university level and the Centres for International Relations at Faculty level (centralized-decentralized organizational concept). 

The university has been operating an office in Beijing since the beginning of 2007 (official inauguration in May 2007). The office is located at the DAAD German Centre and represents the China-NRW University Alliance. The University of Cologne has taken on the task of coordinating academic contacts with China from the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The office will make it easier for members of the consortium to expand their work in China and provide local support. The University of Cologne heads this consortium. The university has further regional offices in New York City and in New Delhi. In Division 9 (International Office), matters are managed by the &quot;Cooperation with the Global South&quot; team. Africa is also represented here.

Number and proportion of international students (including educational residents)

The number of international students in the winter semester 2023/24 was 5,074 (excluding doctoral students). This corresponds to around 11% of the total number of students.

University partnerships and networks

The university maintains over 40 official partnerships. In addition to the official university partnerships, there are almost 300 cooperations and exchange relationships with renowned universities all over the world at the level of the individual faculties and departments.

Extensive funding opportunities are available through the Erasmus programme of the EU, the DAAD or fee waivers agreements with partner universities (complete list of partner universities on the university website). In 2005, the University of Cologne took over the central mediation and coordination of relations between the higher education institutions of North Rhine-Westphalia and China.

Award for the support of international students

In 2004, the University was awarded the Federal Foreign Office’s prize for special services to the support of international students for its centralized and decentralized organizational concept, based on the Centre for International Relations at the Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences.

Humboldt Research Award/AvH International Guest Scholars and Scientists

In 2004, ten of the international scholars and scientists honoured with the Humboldt Research Award of the Humboldt Foundation and 32 early-career scholars and scientists chose to spend their research years at the University of Cologne.

Budget and finances

The total budget of the University of Cologne (including the Faculty of Medicine) amounted to 897.9 million euros in 2021 (of which 287.5 million euros is allocated to the Faculty of Medicine). The budget was made up of 480.8 million euros in state funds, 246.6 million euros in third-party funding, 121.2 million euros in special funds such as QVM or HSP and 49.3 million euros in other income.

Gender equality

The University of Cologne was awarded the title ‘Total E-Quality’ in 2004, 2007, 2014, 2018 and 2022 for its equal opportunities and diversity strategy. The title honours companies as well as higher education institutions and research institutions that successfully implement strategies promoting equal opportunities through HR and institutional measures. In addition, the university holds the ‘family-friendly university’ and ‘shaping diversity’ certificates from the Stifterverband, received the seal of approval for fair and transparent appointment procedures from the German Association of University Professors and Lecturers in 2021 and was awarded ‘LGBTIQ+ Diversity Champion 2021’.

Sustainability

The University of Cologne adopted its university-wide sustainability strategy in June 2023. It anchors the university’s commitment to sustainability in the fields of research, teaching &amp; learning, commitment &amp; transfer as well as in organization &amp; operations. The Vice-Rectorate for Sustainability, which has existed since October 2023, is headed by Kirk W. Junker. The university is a member of DG HochN (German Society for Sustainability at Higher Education Institutions) and Humboldtn, the sustainability initiative of the higher education institutions in North Rhine-Westphalia. In addition, it has been awarded the title ‘Fairtrade University’ since 2018.

<doc id="42758" wikidata="Q81731" url="?curid=42758" title="Murasaki Shikibu">
<text>was a Japanese novelist, poet and lady-in-waiting at the Imperial court in the Heian period. She was best known as the author of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, widely considered to be one of the world&#x27;s first novels, written in Japanese between about 1000 and 1012. Murasaki Shikibu is a descriptive name; her personal name is unknown, but she may have been , who was mentioned in a 1007 court diary as an imperial lady-in-waiting.

Heian women were traditionally excluded from learning Chinese, the written language of government, but Murasaki, raised in her erudite father&#x27;s household, showed a precocious aptitude for the Chinese classics and managed to acquire fluency. She married in her mid-to-late twenties and gave birth to a daughter, Daini no Sanmi. Her husband died after two years of marriage. It is uncertain when she began to write &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, but it was probably while she was married or shortly after she was widowed. In about 1005, she was invited to serve as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Shōshi at the Imperial court by Fujiwara no Michinaga, probably because of her reputation as a writer. She continued to write during her service, adding scenes from court life to her work. After five or six years, she left court and retired with Shōshi to the Lake Biwa region. Scholars differ on the year of her death; although most agree on 1014, others have suggested she was alive in 1025.

Murasaki wrote &quot;The Diary of Lady Murasaki&quot;, a volume of poetry, as well as &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. Within a decade of its completion, &quot;Genji&quot; was distributed throughout the provinces; within a century it was recognized as a classic of Japanese literature and had become a subject of scholarly criticism. Between 1925 and 1933, &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; was published in English. Scholars continue to recognize the importance of her work, which reflects Heian court society at its peak. Since the 13th century her works have been illustrated by Japanese artists and well-known ukiyo-e woodblock masters.

==Early life==
Murasaki Shikibu was born in Heian-kyō, Japan, into the northern Fujiwara clan descending from Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, the first 9th century Fujiwara regent. The Fujiwara clan dominated court politics until the end of the 11th century through strategically marrying their daughters into the imperial family and the use of regencies. In the late 10th century and early 11th century, Fujiwara no Michinaga, the so-called Mido Kampaku, arranged his four daughters into marriages with emperors, giving him unprecedented power. Murasaki&#x27;s great-grandfather, Fujiwara no Kanesuke, had been in the top tier of the aristocracy, but her branch of the family gradually lost power and by the time of Murasaki&#x27;s birth was at the middle to lower ranks of the Heian aristocracy—the level of provincial governors. The lower ranks of the nobility were typically posted away from court to undesirable positions in the provinces, exiled from the centralized power and court in Kyoto.

Despite the loss of status, the family had a reputation among the literati through Murasaki&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather and grandfather, both of whom were well-known poets. Her great-grandfather, Fujiwara no Kanesuke, had 56 poems included in 13 of the Twenty-one Imperial Anthologies, the &quot;Collections of Thirty-six Poets&quot; and the (&quot;Tales of Yamato&quot;). Her great-grandfather and grandfather were both friendly with Ki no Tsurayuki, who became notable for popularizing Japanese-language verse. Her father, Fujiwara no Tametoki, attended the State Academy (Daigaku-ryō) and became a well-respected scholar of Chinese classics and poetry; his own verse was anthologized. He entered public service around 968 as a minor official and was given a governorship in 996, staying in service until about 1018. Murasaki&#x27;s mother was descended from the same branch of northern Fujiwara as Tametoki. The couple had three children, a son and two daughters.

In the Heian era the use of names, insofar as they were recorded, did not follow a modern pattern. A court lady, as well as being known by the title of her own position, if any, took a name referring to the rank or title of a male relative. Thus &quot;Shikibu&quot; is not a modern surname, but refers to , the Ministry of Ceremonials where Murasaki&#x27;s father was a functionary. &quot;Murasaki&quot;, an additional name possibly derived from the color violet associated with wisteria, the meaning of the word (an element of her clan name), may have been bestowed on her at court in reference to the name she herself had given to the main female character in &quot;Genji&quot;. Michinaga mentions the names of several ladies-in-waiting in a 1007 diary entry; one, Fujiwara no Kaoruko (Kyōshi), may be Murasaki&#x27;s personal name.

In Heian-era Japan, husbands and wives kept separate households; children were raised with their mothers, although the patrilineal system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because she lived in her father&#x27;s household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, when they were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she was very close to one sister who died in her twenties.

Murasaki was born at a period when Japan was becoming more isolated, after missions to China had ended and a stronger national culture was emerging. In the 9th and 10th centuries, Japanese gradually became a written language through the development of , a syllabary based on abbreviations of Chinese characters. In Murasaki&#x27;s lifetime, men continued to write formally in Chinese, but became the written language of intimacy and of noblewomen, setting the foundation for unique forms of Japanese literature.

Chinese was taught to Murasaki&#x27;s brother as preparation for a career in government, and during her childhood, living in her father&#x27;s household, she learned and became proficient in classical Chinese. In her diary she wrote, &quot;When my brother ... was a young boy learning the Chinese classics, I was in the habit of listening to him and I became unusually proficient at understanding those passages that he found too difficult to understand and memorize. Father, a most learned man, was always regretting the fact: &#x27;Just my luck,&#x27; he would say, &#x27;What a pity she was not born a man! With her brother she studied Chinese literature, and she probably also received instruction in more traditional subjects such as music, calligraphy and Japanese poetry. Murasaki&#x27;s education was unorthodox. Louis Perez explains in &quot;The History of Japan&quot; that &quot;Women ... were thought to be incapable of real intelligence and therefore were not educated in Chinese.&quot; Murasaki was aware that others saw her as &quot;pretentious, awkward, difficult to approach, prickly, too fond of her tales, haughty, prone to versifying, disdainful, cantankerous and scornful&quot;. Asian literature scholar Thomas Inge believes she had &quot;a forceful personality that seldom won her friends.&quot;

==Marriage==
Aristocratic Heian women lived restricted and secluded lives, allowed to speak to men only when they were close relatives or household members. Murasaki&#x27;s autobiographical poetry shows that she socialized with women but had limited contact with men other than her father and brother; she often exchanged poetry with women but never with men. Unlike most noblewomen of her status, however, she did not marry on reaching puberty; instead she stayed in her father&#x27;s household until her mid-twenties or perhaps even to her early thirties.

In 996 when her father was posted to a four-year governorship in Echizen Province, Murasaki went with him, although it was uncommon for a noblewoman of the period to travel such a distance that could take as long as five days. She returned to Kyoto, probably in 998, to marry her father&#x27;s friend , a much older second cousin. Descended from the same branch of the Fujiwara clan, he was a court functionary and bureaucrat at the Ministry of Ceremonials, with a reputation for dressing extravagantly and as a talented dancer. In his late forties at the time of their marriage, he had multiple households with an unknown number of wives and offspring. Gregarious and well-known at court, he was involved in numerous romantic relationships that may have continued after his marriage to Murasaki. As was customary, she would have remained in her father&#x27;s household where her husband would have visited her. Nobutaka had been granted more than one governorship, and by the time of his marriage to Murasaki he was probably quite wealthy. Interpretations of their marital relationship differ among scholars: Richard Bowring suggests a harmonious marriage, while Japanese literature scholar Haruo Shirane finds evidence of resentment towards her husband in Murasaki’s poems.
The couple&#x27;s daughter, Kenshi (Kataiko), was born in 999. Two years later Nobutaka died during a cholera epidemic. As a married woman Murasaki would have had servants to run the household and care for her daughter, giving her ample leisure time. She enjoyed reading and had access to romances () such as &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot; and &quot;The Tales of Ise.&quot; Scholars believe she may have started writing &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; before her husband&#x27;s death; it is known she was writing after she was widowed, perhaps in a state of grief. In her diary she describes her feelings after her husband&#x27;s death: &quot;I felt depressed and confused. For some years I had existed from day to day in listless fashion ... doing little more than registering the passage of time ... The thought of my continuing loneliness was quite unbearable&quot;.

According to legend, Murasaki retreated to Ishiyama-dera at Lake Biwa, where she was inspired to write &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; on an August night while looking at the Moon. Although scholars dismiss the factual basis of the story of her retreat, Japanese artists often depicted her at Ishiyama Temple staring at the Moon for inspiration. She may have been commissioned to write the story and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero Prince Genji. Murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of &quot;Genji&quot; to friends who in turn would have re-copied them and passed them on. By this practice the story became known and she gained a reputation as an author.

In her early to mid-thirties, she became a lady-in-waiting () at court, most likely because of her reputation as an author. Chieko Mulhern writes in &quot;Japanese Women Writers, a Biocritical Sourcebook&quot; that scholars have wondered why Murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life. Her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with Michinaga after her husband&#x27;s death, leading to speculation that the two may have been lovers. Bowring sees no evidence that she was brought to court as Michinaga&#x27;s concubine, although he did bring her to court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Shōshi.

==Court life==

Heian culture and court life reached a peak early in the 11th century. The population of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized as some of the earliest and among the best literature written in Japanese canon.

When in 995 Michinaga&#x27;s two brothers Fujiwara no Michitaka and Fujiwara no Michikane died, leaving the regency vacant, Michinaga quickly won a power struggle against his nephew Fujiwara no Korechika (brother to Teishi, Emperor Ichijō&#x27;s wife), and, aided by his sister Senshi, he assumed power. Teishi had supported her brother Korechika, who was discredited and banished from court in 996 following a scandal involving his shooting at the retired Emperor Kazan, causing her to lose power. Four years later Michinaga sent Shōshi, his eldest daughter, to Emperor Ichijō&#x27;s harem when she was about 12. A year after placing Shōshi in the imperial harem, in an effort to undermine Teishi&#x27;s influence and increase Shōshi&#x27;s standing, Michinaga had her named Empress although Teishi already held the title. As historian Donald Shively explains, &quot;Michinaga shocked even his admirers by arranging for the unprecedented appointment of Teishi (or Sadako) and Shōshi as concurrent empresses of the same emperor, Teishi holding the usual title of &quot;Lustrous Heir-bearer&quot; and Shōshi that of &quot;Inner Palatine&quot; (), a toponymically derived equivalent coined for the occasion&quot;. About five years later, Michinaga brought Murasaki to Shōshi&#x27;s court, in a position that Bowring describes as a companion-tutor.

Women of high status lived in seclusion at court and, through strategic marriages, were used to gain political power for their families. In the case of Shōshi and other such marriages to members of the imperial clan, it enabled the woman&#x27;s clan to exercise influence over the emperor—this was how Michinaga, and other Fujiwara Regents, achieved their power. Despite their seclusion, some women wielded considerable influence, often achieved through competitive salons, dependent on the quality of those attending. Ichijō&#x27;s mother and Michinaga&#x27;s sister, Senshi, had an influential salon, and Michinaga probably wanted Shōshi to surround herself with skilled women such as Murasaki to build a rival salon.

Shōshi was 16 to 19 when Murasaki joined her court, either in 1005 or 1006. According to Arthur Waley, Shōshi was a serious-minded young lady, whose living arrangements were divided between her father&#x27;s household and her court at the Imperial Palace. She gathered around her talented women writers such as Izumi Shikibu and Akazome Emon—the author of an early vernacular history, &quot;The Tale of Flowering Fortunes&quot;. The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki&#x27;s diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: &quot;Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; but there is something not very satisfactory about her. She has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running-hand; but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate. Indeed it does not seem to me that in herself she is really a poet at all.&quot;

Sei Shōnagon, author of &quot;The Pillow Book&quot;, had been in service as lady-in-waiting to Teishi when Shōshi came to court; it is possible that Murasaki was invited to Shōshi&#x27;s court as a rival to Shōnagon. Teishi died in 1001, before Murasaki entered service with Shōshi, so the two writers were not there concurrently, but Murasaki, who wrote about Shōnagon in her diary, certainly knew of her, and to an extent was influenced by her. Shōnagon&#x27;s &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; may have been commissioned as a type of propaganda to highlight Teishi&#x27;s court, known for its educated ladies-in-waiting. Japanese literature scholar Joshua Mostow believes Michinaga provided Murasaki to Shōshi as an equally or better educated woman, so as to showcase Shōshi&#x27;s court in a similar manner.

The two writers had different temperaments: Shōnagon was witty, clever, and outspoken; Murasaki was withdrawn and sensitive. Entries in Murasaki&#x27;s diary show that the two may not have been on good terms. Murasaki wrote, &quot;Sei Shōnagon ... was dreadfully conceited. She thought herself so clever, littered her writing with Chinese characters, [which] left a great deal to be desired.&quot; Keene thinks that Murasaki&#x27;s impression of Shōnagon could have been influenced by Shōshi and the women at her court, as Shōnagon served Shōshi&#x27;s rival empress. Furthermore, he believes Murasaki was brought to court to write &quot;Genji&quot; in response to Shōnagon&#x27;s popular &quot;Pillow Book&quot;. Murasaki contrasted herself to Shōnagon in a variety of ways. She denigrated the pillow book genre and, unlike Shōnagon, who flaunted her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki pretended to not know the language, regarding it as pretentious and affected.
===&quot;The Lady of the Chronicles&quot;===
Although the popularity of the Chinese language diminished in the late Heian era, Chinese ballads continued to be popular, including those written by Bai Juyi. Murasaki taught Chinese to Shōshi who was interested in Chinese art and Juyi&#x27;s ballads. Upon becoming Empress, Shōshi installed screens decorated with Chinese script, causing outrage because written Chinese was considered the language of men, far removed from the women&#x27;s quarters. The study of Chinese was thought to be unladylike and went against the notion that only men should have access to the literature. Women were supposed to read and write only in Japanese, which separated them through language from government and the power structure. Murasaki, with her unconventional classical Chinese education, was one of the few women available to teach Shōshi classical Chinese. Bowring writes it was &quot;almost subversive&quot; that Murasaki knew Chinese and taught the language to Shōshi. Murasaki, who was reticent about her Chinese education, held the lessons between the two women in secret, writing in her diary, &quot;Since last summer ... very secretly, in odd moments when there happened to be no one about, I have been reading with Her Majesty ... There has of course been no question of formal lessons ... I have thought it best to say nothing about the matter to anybody.&quot;

Murasaki probably earned an ambiguous nickname, &quot;The Lady of the Chronicles&quot; (), for teaching Shōshi Chinese literature. A lady-in-waiting who disliked Murasaki accused her of flaunting her knowledge of Chinese and began calling her &quot;The Lady of the Chronicles&quot;—an allusion to the classic &quot;Chronicles of Japan&quot;—after an incident in which chapters from &quot;Genji&quot; were read aloud to the Emperor and his courtiers, one of whom remarked that the author showed a high level of education. Murasaki wrote in her diary, &quot;How utterly ridiculous! Would I, who hesitate to reveal my learning to my women at home, ever think of doing so at court?&quot; Although the nickname was apparently meant to be disparaging, Mulhern believes Murasaki was flattered by it.

The attitude toward the Chinese language was contradictory. In Teishi&#x27;s court, the Chinese language had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Shōshi&#x27;s salon there was a great deal of hostility towards the language—perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese—even though Shōshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility may have affected Murasaki and her opinion of the court, and forced her to hide her knowledge of Chinese. Unlike Shōnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning Japanese culture.
Murasaki seems to have been unhappy with court life and was withdrawn and somber. No surviving records show that she entered poetry competitions; she appears to have exchanged few poems or letters with other women during her service. In general, unlike Shōnagon, Murasaki gives the impression in her diary that she disliked court life, the other ladies-in-waiting, and the drunken revelry. She did, however, become close friends with a lady-in-waiting named Lady Saishō, and she wrote of the winters that she enjoyed, &quot;I love to see the snow here&quot;.

According to Waley, Murasaki may not have been unhappy with court life in general but bored in Shōshi&#x27;s court. He speculates she would have preferred to serve with the Lady Senshi, whose household seems to have been less strict and more light-hearted. In her diary, Murasaki wrote about Shōshi&#x27;s court, &quot;[she] has gathered round her a number of very worthy young ladies ... Her Majesty is beginning to acquire more experience of life, and no longer judges others by the same rigid standards as before; but meanwhile her Court has gained a reputation for extreme dullness&quot;.

Murasaki disliked the men at court, whom she thought were drunken and stupid. However, some scholars, such as Waley, are certain she was involved romantically with Michinaga. At the least, Michinaga pursued her and pressured her strongly, and her flirtation with him is recorded in her diary as late as 1010. Yet, she wrote to him in a poem, &quot;You have neither read my book, nor won my love.&quot; In her diary she records having to avoid advances from Michinaga—one night he sneaked into her room, stealing a newly written chapter of &quot;Genji.&quot; However, Michinaga&#x27;s patronage was essential if she was to continue writing. Murasaki described her daughter&#x27;s court activities: the lavish ceremonies, the complicated courtships, the &quot;complexities of the marriage system&quot;, and in elaborate detail, the birth of Shōshi&#x27;s two sons.

It is likely that Murasaki enjoyed writing in solitude. She believed she did not fit well with the general atmosphere of the court, writing of herself: &quot;I am wrapped up in the study of ancient stories ... living all the time in a poetical world of my own scarcely realizing the existence of other people ... But when they get to know me, they find to their extreme surprise that I am kind and gentle&quot;. Inge says that she was too outspoken to make friends at court, and Mulhern thinks Murasaki&#x27;s court life was comparatively quiet compared to other court poets. Mulhern speculates that her remarks about Izumi were not so much directed at Izumi&#x27;s poetry but at her behavior, lack of morality and her court liaisons, of which Murasaki disapproved.

Rank was important in Heian court society and Murasaki would not have felt herself to have much, if anything, in common with the higher ranked and more powerful Fujiwaras. In her diary, she wrote of her life at court: &quot;I realized that my branch of the family was a very humble one; but the thought seldom troubled me, and I was in those days far indeed from the painful consciousness of inferiority which makes life at Court a continual torment to me.&quot; A court position would have increased her social standing, but more importantly she gained a greater experience to write about. Court life, as she experienced it, is well reflected in the chapters of &quot;Genji&quot; written after she joined Shōshi. The name Murasaki was most probably given to her at a court dinner in an incident she recorded in her diary: in 1008 the well-known court poet Fujiwara no Kintō inquired after the &quot;Young Murasaki&quot;—an allusion to the character named Murasaki in &quot;Genji&quot;—which would have been considered a compliment from a male court poet to a female author.

==Later life and death==

When Emperor Ichijō died in 1011, Shōshi retired from the Imperial Palace to live in a Fujiwara mansion in Biwa, most likely accompanied by Murasaki, who is recorded as being there with Shōshi in 1013. George Aston explains that when Murasaki retired from court she was again associated with Ishiyama-dera: &quot;To this beautiful spot, it is said, Murasaki no Shikibu &quot;[sic]&quot; retired from court life to devote the remainder of her days to literature and religion. There are sceptics, however, Motoori being one, who refuse to believe this story, pointing out ... that it is irreconcilable with known facts. On the other hand, the very chamber in the temple where the &quot;Genji&quot; was written is shown—with the ink-slab which the author used, and a Buddhist Sutra in her handwriting, which, if they do not satisfy the critic, still are sufficient to carry conviction to the minds of ordinary visitors to the temple.&quot;

Murasaki may have died in 1014. Her father made a hasty return to Kyoto from his post at Echigo Province that year, possibly because of her death. Writing in &quot;A Bridge of Dreams: A Poetics of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;&quot;, Shirane mentions that 1014 is generally accepted as the date of Murasaki Shikibu&#x27;s death and 973 as the date of her birth, making her 41 when she died. Bowring considers 1014 to be speculative, and believes she may have lived with Shōshi until as late as 1025. Waley agrees given that Murasaki may have attended ceremonies with Shōshi held for Shōshi&#x27;s son, Emperor Go-Ichijō around 1025.

Murasaki&#x27;s brother Nobunori died in around 1011, which, combined with the death of his daughter, may have prompted her father to resign his post and take vows at Miidera temple where he died in 1029. Murasaki&#x27;s daughter entered court service in 1025 as a wet nurse to the future Emperor Go-Reizei (1025–1068). She went on to become a well-known poet as Daini no Sanmi.

==Works==

Three works are attributed to Murasaki: &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, &quot;The Diary of Lady Murasaki&quot; and &quot;Poetic Memoirs&quot;, a collection of 128 poems. Her work is considered important for its reflection of the creation and development of Japanese writing, during a period when Japanese shifted from an unwritten vernacular to a written language. Until the 9th century, Japanese language texts were written in Chinese characters using the writing system. A revolutionary achievement was the development of , a true Japanese script, in the mid-to late 9th century. Japanese authors began to write prose in their own language, which led to genres such as tales () and poetic journals (). Historian Edwin Reischauer writes that genres such as the monogatari were distinctly Japanese and that &quot;Genji&quot;, written in , &quot;was the outstanding work of the period&quot;.

===Diary and poetry===
Murasaki began her diary after she entered service at Shōshi&#x27;s court. Much of what is known about her and her experiences at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, some of which may have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga&#x27;s temperament, the birth of Shōshi&#x27;s sons—at Michinaga&#x27;s mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace—and the process of writing &quot;Genji&quot;, including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Shōshi&#x27;s son Emperor Go-Ichijō, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter&#x27;s marriage which made him grandfather and &quot;de facto&quot; regent to an emperor.

&quot;Poetic Memoirs&quot; is a collection of 128 poems Mulhern describes as &quot;arranged in a biographical sequence&quot;. The original set has been lost. According to custom, the verses would have been passed from person to person and often copied. Some appear written for a lover—possibly her husband before he died—but she may have merely followed tradition and written simple love poems. They contain biographical details: she mentions a sister who died, the visit to Echizen province with her father and that she wrote poetry for Shōshi. Murasaki&#x27;s poems were published in 1206 by Fujiwara no Teika, in what Mulhern believes to be the collection that is closest to the original form; at around the same time Teika included a selection of Murasaki&#x27;s works in an imperial anthology, &quot;New Collections of Ancient and Modern Times&quot;.

===&quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;===

Murasaki is best known for her &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, a three-part novel spanning 1100 pages and 54 chapters, which is thought to have taken a decade to complete. The earliest chapters were possibly written for a private patron either during her marriage or shortly after her husband&#x27;s death. She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Shōshi. She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper and ink, and with calligraphers. The first handwritten volumes were probably assembled and bound by ladies-in-waiting.

In his &quot;The Pleasures of Japanese Literature&quot;, Keene claims Murasaki wrote the &quot;supreme work of Japanese fiction&quot; by drawing on traditions of court diaries, and earlier —written in a mixture of Chinese script and Japanese script—such as &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot; or &quot;The Tales of Ise&quot;. She drew on and blended styles from Chinese histories, narrative poetry and contemporary Japanese prose. Adolphson writes that the juxtaposition of formal Chinese style with mundane subjects resulted in a sense of parody or satire, giving her a distinctive voice. &quot;Genji&quot; follows the traditional format of —telling a tale—particularly evident in its use of a narrator, but Keene claims Murasaki developed the genre far beyond its bounds, and by doing so created a form that is utterly modern. The story of the &quot;shining prince&quot; Genji is set in the late 9th to early 10th centuries, and Murasaki eliminated from it the elements of fairy tales and fantasy frequently found in earlier .

The themes in &quot;Genji&quot; are common to the period, and are defined by Shively as encapsulating &quot;the tyranny of time and the inescapable sorrow of romantic love&quot;. The main theme is that of the fragility of life, &quot;the sorrow of human existence&quot; (), a term used over a thousand times in &quot;Genji&quot;. Keene speculates that in her tale of the &quot;shining prince&quot;, Murasaki may have created for herself an idealistic escape from court life, which she found less than savory. In Prince Genji she formed a gifted, comely, refined, yet human and sympathetic protagonist. Keene writes that &quot;Genji&quot; gives a view into the Heian period; for example love affairs flourished, although women typically remained unseen behind screens, curtains or .

Helen McCullough describes Murasaki&#x27;s writing as of universal appeal and believes &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; &quot;transcends both its genre and age. Its basic subject matter and setting—love at the Heian court—are those of the romance, and its cultural assumptions are those of the mid-Heian period, but Murasaki Shikibu&#x27;s unique genius has made the work for many a powerful statement of human relationships, the impossibility of permanent happiness in love ... and the vital importance, in a world of sorrows, of sensitivity to the feelings of others.&quot; Prince Genji recognizes in each of his lovers the inner beauty of the woman and the fragility of life, which according to Keene, makes him heroic. The story was popular: Emperor Ichijō had it read to him, even though it was written in Japanese. By 1021 all the chapters were known to be complete and the work was sought after in the provinces where it was scarce.

==Legacy==
Murasaki&#x27;s reputation and influence have not diminished since her lifetime when she, with other Heian women writers, was instrumental in developing Japanese into a written language. Her writing was required reading for court poets as early as the 12th century as her work began to be studied by scholars who generated authoritative versions and criticism. Within a century of her death she was highly regarded as a classical writer. In the 17th century, Murasaki&#x27;s work became emblematic of Confucian philosophy and women were encouraged to read her books. In 1673, Kumazawa Banzan argued that her writing was valuable for its sensitivity and depiction of emotions. He wrote in his &quot;Discursive Commentary on Genji&quot; that when &quot;human feelings are not understood the harmony of the Five Human Relationships is lost.&quot;

&quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; was copied and illustrated in various forms as early as a century after Murasaki&#x27;s death. &quot;The Genji Monogatari Emaki&quot;, is a late Heian era 12th century handscroll, consisting of four scrolls, 19 paintings, and 20 sheets of calligraphy. The illustrations, definitively dated to between 1110 and 1120, have been tentatively attributed to Fujiwara no Takachika and the calligraphy to various well-known contemporary calligraphers. The scroll is housed at the Gotoh Museum and the Tokugawa Art Museum.

Female virtue was tied to literary knowledge in the 17th century, leading to a demand for Murasaki or &quot;Genji&quot; inspired artifacts, known as . Dowry sets decorated with scenes from &quot;Genji&quot; or illustrations of Murasaki became particularly popular for noblewomen: in the 17th century symbolically imbued a bride with an increased level of cultural status; by the 18th century they had come to symbolize marital success. In 1628, Tokugawa Iemitsu&#x27;s daughter had a set of lacquer boxes made for her wedding; Prince Toshitada received a pair of silk screens, painted by Kanō Tan&#x27;yū as a wedding gift in 1649.

Murasaki became a popular subject of paintings and illustrations highlighting her as a virtuous woman and poet. She is often shown at her desk in Ishiyama Temple, staring at the Moon for inspiration. Tosa Mitsuoki made her the subject of hanging scrolls in the 17th century. &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; became a favorite subject of Japanese artists for centuries with artists such as Hiroshige, Kiyonaga, and Utamaro illustrating various editions of the novel. While early Genji art was considered symbolic of court culture, by the middle of the Edo period the mass-produced prints made the illustrations accessible for the samurai classes and commoners.

In &quot;Envisioning the &quot;Tale of Genji&quot; Shirane observes that &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; has become many things to many different audiences through many different media over a thousand years ... unmatched by any other Japanese text or artifact.&quot; The work and its author were popularized through its illustrations in various media: (illustrated handscrolls); (screen paintings), (woodblock prints); films, comics, and in the modern period, manga. In her fictionalized account of Murasaki&#x27;s life, &quot;The Tale of Murasaki: A Novel&quot;, Liza Dalby has Murasaki involved in a romance during her travels with her father to Echizen Province.

&quot;The Tale of the Genji&quot; is recognized as an enduring classic. McCullough writes that Murasaki &quot;is both the quintessential representative of a unique society and a writer who speaks to universal human concerns with a timeless voice. Japan has not seen another such genius.&quot; Keene writes that &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; continues to captivate, because, in the story, her characters and their concerns are universal. When Waley&#x27;s translation (&quot;The Tale of Genji: A Novel in Six Parts&quot;) was published in 1933, reviewers compared &quot;Genji&quot; to Austen, Proust, and Shakespeare. Mulhern says of Murasaki that she is similar to Shakespeare, who represented his Elizabethan England, in that she captured the essence of the Heian court and as a novelist &quot;succeeded perhaps even beyond her own expectations.&quot; Like Shakespeare, her work has been the subject of reams of criticism and many books.
Kyoto held a year-long celebration commemorating the 1000th anniversary of &quot;Genji&quot; in 2008, with poetry competitions, visits to the Tale of Genji Museum in Uji and Ishiyama-dera (where a life size rendition of Murasaki at her desk was displayed), and women dressing in traditional 12-layer Heian court and ankle-length wigs. The author and her work inspired museum exhibits and Genji manga spin-offs. The design on the reverse of the first 2000 yen note commemorated her and &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. A plant bearing purple berries has been named after her.

A &quot;Genji Album&quot;, only in the 1970s dated to 1510, is housed at Harvard University. The album is considered the earliest of its kind and consists of 54 paintings by Tosa Mitsunobu and 54 sheets of calligraphy on paper in five colors, written by master calligraphers. The leaves are housed in a case dated to the Edo period, with a silk frontispiece painted by Tosa Mitsuoki, dated to around 1690. The album contains Mitsuoki&#x27;s authentication slips for his ancestor&#x27;s 16th century paintings.
