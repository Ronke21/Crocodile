<text>Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams synchronously over optical fiber using lasers or highly coherent light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs). At low transmission rates, data can also be transferred via an electrical interface. The method was developed to replace the plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) system for transporting large amounts of telephone calls and data traffic over the same fiber without the problems of synchronization.

SONET and SDH, which are essentially the same, were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications, e.g. DS1, DS3, from a variety of different sources. However, they were primarily designed to support real-time, uncompressed, circuit-switched voice encoded in PCM format. The primary difficulty in doing this prior to SONET/SDH was that the synchronization sources of these various circuits were different. This meant that each circuit was actually operating at a slightly different rate and with different phase. SONET/SDH allowed for the simultaneous transport of many different circuits of differing origin within a single framing protocol. SONET/SDH is not a complete communications protocol in itself, but a transport protocol (not a &quot;transport&quot; in the OSI Model sense).

Due to SONET/SDH&#x27;s essential protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH was the choice for transporting the fixed length Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) frames also known as cells. It quickly evolved mapping structures and concatenated payload containers to transport ATM connections. In other words, for ATM (and eventually other protocols such as Ethernet), the internal complex structure previously used to transport circuit-oriented connections was removed and replaced with a large and concatenated frame (such as STS-3c) into which ATM cells, IP packets, or Ethernet frames are placed.
Both SDH and SONET are widely used today: SONET in the United States and Canada, and SDH in the rest of the world. Although the SONET standards were developed before SDH, it is considered a variation of SDH because of SDH&#x27;s greater worldwide market penetration.
SONET is subdivided into four sublayers with some factor such as the path, line, section and physical layer.

The SDH standard was originally defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and is formalised as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standards G.707, G.783, G.784, and G.803. The SONET standard was defined by Telcordia and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard T1.105. which define the set of transmission formats and transmission rates in the range above 51.840 Mbit/s.

==Difference from PDH==
SDH differs from Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH) in that the exact rates that are used to transport the data on SONET/SDH are tightly synchronized across the entire network, using atomic clocks. This synchronization system allows entire inter-country networks to operate synchronously, greatly reducing the amount of buffering required between elements in the network.
Both SONET and SDH can be used to encapsulate earlier digital transmission standards, such as the PDH standard, or they can be used to directly support either Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or so-called packet over SONET/SDH (POS) networking. Therefore, it is inaccurate to think of SDH or SONET as communications protocols in and of themselves; they are generic, all-purpose transport containers for moving both voice and data. The basic format of a SONET/SDH signal allows it to carry many different services in its virtual container (VC), because it is bandwidth-flexible.

==Protocol overview==
SONET and SDH often use different terms to describe identical features or functions. This can cause confusion and exaggerate their differences. With a few exceptions, SDH can be thought of as a superset of SONET.

SONET is a set of transport containers that allow for delivery of a variety of protocols, including traditional telephony, ATM, Ethernet, and TCP/IP traffic. SONET therefore is not in itself a native communications protocol and should not be confused as being necessarily connection-oriented in the way that term is usually used.

The protocol is a heavily multiplexed structure, with the header interleaved between the data in a complex way. This permits the encapsulated data to have its own frame rate and be able to &quot;float around&quot; relative to the SDH/SONET frame structure and rate. This interleaving permits a very low latency for the encapsulated data. Data passing through equipment can be delayed by at most 32 μs, compared to a frame rate of 125 μs; in many competing protocols, which buffer the data during such transits for at least one frame or packet before sending it on. Extra padding is allowed for the multiplexed data to move within the overall framing, as the data is clocked at a different rate than the frame rate. The protocol is made more complex by the decision to permit this padding at most levels of the multiplexing structure, but it improves all-around performance.

==Basic transmission unit==
The basic unit of framing in SDH is a STM-1 (Synchronous Transport Module, level 1), which operates at 155.520 megabits per second (Mbit/s). SONET refers to this basic unit as an STS-3c (Synchronous Transport Signal 3, concatenated). When the STS-3c is carried over OC-3, it is often colloquially referred to as OC-3c, but this is not an official designation within the SONET standard as there is no physical layer (i.e. optical) difference between an STS-3c and 3 STS-1s carried within an OC-3.

SONET offers an additional basic unit of transmission, the STS-1 (Synchronous Transport Signal 1) or OC-1, operating at 51.84 Mbit/s—exactly one third of an STM-1/STS-3c/OC-3c carrier. This speed is dictated by the bandwidth requirements for PCM-encoded telephonic voice signals: at this rate, an STS-1/OC-1 circuit can carry the bandwidth equivalent of a standard DS-3 channel, which can carry 672 64-kbit/s voice channels. In SONET, the STS-3c signal is composed of three multiplexed STS-1 signals; the STS-3c may be carried on an OC-3 signal. Some manufacturers also support the SDH equivalent of the STS-1/OC-1, known as STM-0.

===Framing===
In packet-oriented data transmission, such as Ethernet, a packet frame usually consists of a header and a payload. The header is transmitted first, followed by the payload (and possibly a trailer, such as a CRC). In synchronous optical networking, this is modified slightly. The header is termed the &quot;overhead&quot;, and instead of being transmitted before the payload, is interleaved with it during transmission. Part of the overhead is transmitted, then part of the payload, then the next part of the overhead, then the next part of the payload, until the entire frame has been transmitted.

In the case of an STS-1, the frame is 810 octets in size, while the STM-1/STS-3c frame is 2,430 octets in size. For STS-1, the frame is transmitted as three octets of overhead, followed by 87 octets of payload. This is repeated nine times, until 810 octets have been transmitted, taking 125 μs. In the case of an STS-3c/STM-1, which operates three times faster than an STS-1, nine octets of overhead are transmitted, followed by 261 octets of payload. This is also repeated nine times until 2,430 octets have been transmitted, also taking 125 μs. For both SONET and SDH, this is often represented by displaying the frame graphically: as a block of 90 columns and nine rows for STS-1, and 270 columns and nine rows for STM1/STS-3c. This representation aligns all the overhead columns, so the overhead appears as a contiguous block, as does the payload.

The internal structure of the overhead and payload within the frame differs slightly between SONET and SDH, and different terms are used in the standards to describe these structures. Their standards are extremely similar in implementation, making it easy to interoperate between SDH and SONET at any given bandwidth.

In practice, the terms STS-1 and OC-1 are sometimes used interchangeably, though the OC designation refers to the signal in its optical form. It is therefore incorrect to say that an OC-3 contains 3 OC-1s: an OC-3 can be said to contain 3 STS-1s.

===SDH frame===

The Synchronous Transport Module, level 1 (STM-1) frame is the basic transmission format for SDH—the first level of the synchronous digital hierarchy. The STM-1 frame is transmitted in exactly 125 μs, therefore, there are 8,000 frames per second on a 155.52 Mbit/s OC-3 fiber-optic circuit. The STM-1 frame consists of overhead and pointers plus information payload. The first nine columns of each frame make up the section overhead and administrative unit pointers, and the last 261 columns make up the information payload. The pointers (H1, H2, H3 bytes) identify administrative units (AU) within the information payload. Thus, an OC-3 circuit can carry 150.336 Mbit/s of payload, after accounting for the overhead.

Carried within the information payload, which has its own frame structure of nine rows and 261 columns, are administrative units identified by pointers. Also within the administrative unit are one or more virtual containers (VCs). VCs contain path overhead and VC payload. The first column is for path overhead; it is followed by the payload container, which can itself carry other containers. Administrative units can have any phase alignment within the STM frame, and this alignment is indicated by the pointer in row four.

The section overhead (SOH) of a STM-1 signal is divided into two parts: the &quot;regenerator section overhead&quot; (RSOH) and the &quot;multiplex section overhead&quot; (MSOH). The overheads contain information from the transmission system itself, which is used for a wide range of management functions, such as monitoring transmission quality, detecting failures, managing alarms, data communication channels, service channels, etc.

The STM frame is continuous and is transmitted in a serial fashion: byte-by-byte, row-by-row.

====Transport overhead====
The transport overhead is used for signaling and measuring transmission error rates, and is composed as follows:

:;Section overhead: Called regenerator section overhead (RSOH) in SDH terminology: 27 octets containing information about the frame structure required by the terminal equipment.
:;Line overhead: Called multiplex section overhead (MSOH) in SDH: 45 octets containing information about error correction and Automatic Protection Switching messages (e.g., alarms and maintenance messages) as may be required within the network. The error correction is included for STM-16 and above.
:;Administrative unit (AU) pointer: Points to the location of the J1 byte in the payload (the first byte in the virtual container).

====Path virtual envelope====
Data transmitted from end to end is referred to as &quot;path data&quot;. It is composed of two components:
:;Payload overhead (POH): 9 octets used for end-to-end signaling and error measurement.
:;Payload: User data (774 bytes for STM-0/STS-1, or 2,430 octets for STM-1/STS-3c)

For STS-1, the payload is referred to as the synchronous payload envelope (SPE), which in turn has 18 stuffing bytes, leading to the STS-1 payload capacity of 756 bytes.

The STS-1 payload is designed to carry a full PDH DS3 frame. When the DS3 enters a SONET network, path overhead is added, and that SONET network element (NE) is said to be a &quot;path generator and terminator&quot;. The SONET NE is &quot;line terminating&quot; if it processes the line overhead. Note that wherever the line or path is terminated, the section is terminated also. SONET regenerators terminate the section, but not the paths or line.

An STS-1 payload can also be subdivided into seven &quot;virtual tributary groups&quot; (VTGs). Each VTG can then be subdivided into four VT1.5 signals, each of which can carry a PDH DS1 signal. A VTG may instead be subdivided into three VT2 signals, each of which can carry a PDH E1 signal. The SDH equivalent of a VTG is a TUG-2; VT1.5 is equivalent to VC-11, and VT2 is equivalent to VC-12.

Three STS-1 signals may be multiplexed by time-division multiplexing to form the next level of the SONET hierarchy, the OC-3 (STS-3), running at 155.52 Mbit/s. The signal is multiplexed by interleaving the bytes of the three STS-1 frames to form the STS-3 frame, containing 2,430 bytes and transmitted in 125 μs.

Higher-speed circuits are formed by successively aggregating multiples of slower circuits, their speed always being immediately apparent from their designation. For example, four STS-3 or AU4 signals can be aggregated to form a 622.08 Mbit/s signal designated OC-12 or STM-4.

The highest rate commonly deployed is the OC-768 or STM-256 circuit, which operates at rate of just under 38.5 Gbit/s. Where fiber exhaustion is a concern, multiple SONET signals can be transported over multiple wavelengths on a single fiber pair by means of wavelength-division multiplexing, including dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) and coarse wavelength-division multiplexing (CWDM). DWDM circuits are the basis for all modern submarine communications cable systems and other long-haul circuits.

==SONET/SDH and relationship to 10 Gigabit Ethernet==
Another type of high-speed data networking circuit is 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE). The Gigabit Ethernet Alliance created two 10 Gigabit Ethernet variants: a local area variant (LAN PHY) with a line rate of 10.3125 Gbit/s, and a wide area variant (WAN PHY) with the same line rate as OC-192/STM-64 (9,953,280 kbit/s). 

The WAN PHY variant encapsulates Ethernet data using a lightweight SDH/SONET frame, so as to be compatible at a low level with equipment designed to carry SDH/SONET signals, whereas the LAN PHY variant encapsulates Ethernet data using 64B/66B line coding.

However, 10 Gigabit Ethernet does not explicitly provide any interoperability at the bitstream level with other SDH/SONET systems. This differs from WDM system transponders, including both coarse and dense wavelength-division multiplexing systems (CWDM and DWDM) that currently support OC-192 SONET signals, which can normally support thin-SONET–framed 10 Gigabit Ethernet.

==SONET/SDH data rates==


User throughput must not deduct path overhead from the payload bandwidth, but path-overhead bandwidth is variable based on the types of cross-connects built across the optical system.

Note that the data-rate progression starts at 155 Mbit/s and increases by multiples of four. The only exception is OC-24, which is standardized in ANSI T1.105, but not a SDH standard rate in ITU-T G.707. Other rates, such as OC-9, OC-18, OC-36, OC-96, and OC-1536, are defined but not commonly deployed; most are considered orphaned rates.

==Physical layer==
The physical layer refers to the first layer in the OSI networking model. The ATM and SDH layers are the regenerator section level, digital line level, transmission path level, virtual path level, and virtual channel level. The physical layer is modeled on three major entities: transmission path, digital line and the regenerator section. The regenerator section refers to the section and photonic layers. The photonic layer is the lowest SONET layer and it is responsible for transmitting the bits to the physical medium. The section layer is responsible for generating the proper STS-N frames which are to be transmitted across the physical medium. It deals with issues such as proper framing, error monitoring, section maintenance, and orderwire. 

The line layer ensures reliable transport of the payload and overhead generated by the path layer. It provides synchronization and multiplexing for multiple paths. It modifies overhead bits relating to quality control. The path layer is SONET&#x27;s highest level layer. It takes data to be transmitted and transforms them into signals required by the line layer, and adds or modifies the path overhead bits for performance monitoring and protection switching.

==SONET/SDH network management protocols==

===Overall functionality===
Network management systems are used to configure and monitor SDH and SONET equipment either locally or remotely.

The systems consist of three essential parts, covered later in more detail:
* Software running on a &quot;network management system terminal&quot;, e.g. workstation, dumb terminal or laptop housed in an exchange/central office.
* Transport of network management data between the &quot;network management system terminal&quot; and the SONET/SDH equipment, e.g. using TL1/Q3 protocols.
* Transport of network management data between SDH/SONET equipment using &quot;dedicated embedded data communication channels&quot; (DCCs) within the section and line overhead.

The main functions of network management thereby include:
;Network and network-element provisioning
:In order to allocate bandwidth throughout a network, each network element must be configured. Although this can be done locally, through a craft interface, it is normally done through a network management system (sitting at a higher layer) that, in turn, operates through the SONET/SDH network management network.
;Software upgrade
:Network-element software upgrades are done mostly through the SONET/SDH management network in modern equipment.
;Performance management
:Network elements have a very large set of standards for performance management. The performance-management criteria allow not only monitoring the health of individual network elements, but isolating and identifying most network defects or outages. Higher-layer network monitoring and management software allows the proper filtering and troubleshooting of network-wide performance management, so that defects and outages can be quickly identified and resolved.

Consider the three parts defined above:

===Network management system terminal===
;Local Craft interface
:Local &quot;craftspersons&quot; (telephone network engineers) can access a SDH/SONET network element on a &quot;craft port&quot; and issue commands through a dumb terminal or terminal emulation program running on a laptop. This interface can also be attached to a console server, allowing for remote out-of-band management and logging.

; Network management system (sitting at a higher layer)
This will often consist of software running on a Workstation covering a number of SDH/SONET network elements

===TL1/Q3 Protocols===

;TL1
SONET equipment is often managed with the TL1 protocol. TL1 is a telecom language for managing and reconfiguring SONET network elements. The command language used by a SONET network element, such as TL1, must be carried by other management protocols, such as SNMP, CORBA, or XML.
;Q3
SDH has been mainly managed using the Q3 interface protocol suite defined in ITU recommendations Q.811 and Q.812. With the convergence of SONET and SDH on switching matrix and network elements architecture, newer implementations have also offered TL1.

Most SONET NEs have a limited number of management interfaces defined:

;TL1 Electrical interface
:The electrical interface, often a 50-ohm coaxial cable, sends SONET TL1 commands from a local management network physically housed in the central office where the SONET network element is located. This is for local management of that network element and, possibly, remote management of other SONET network elements.

===Dedicated embedded data communication channels (DCCs)===

: SONET and SDH have dedicated data communication channels (DCCs) within the section and line overhead for management traffic. Generally, section overhead (&quot;regenerator section&quot; in SDH) is used. According to ITU-T G.7712, there are three modes used for management:
:*IP-only stack, using PPP as data-link
:*OSI-only stack, using LAP-D as data-link
:*Dual (IP+OSI) stack using PPP or LAP-D with tunneling functions to communicate between stacks.

To handle all of the possible management channels and signals, most modern network elements contain a router for the network commands and underlying (data) protocols.

==Equipment==
With advances in SONET and SDH chipsets, the traditional categories of network elements are no longer distinct. Nevertheless, as network architectures have remained relatively constant, even newer equipment (including multi-service provisioning platforms) can be examined in light of the architectures they will support. Thus, there is value in viewing new, as well as traditional, equipment in terms of the older categories.

===Regenerator===
Traditional regenerators terminate the section overhead, but not the line or path. Regenerators extend long-haul routes in a way similar to most regenerators, by converting an optical signal that has already traveled a long distance into electrical format and then retransmitting a regenerated high-power signal.

Since the late 1990s, regenerators have been largely replaced by optical amplifiers. Also, some of the functionality of regenerators has been absorbed by the transponders of wavelength-division multiplexing systems.

===STS multiplexer and demultiplexer===
STS multiplexer and demultiplexer provide the interface between an electrical tributary network and the optical network.

===Add-drop multiplexer===
Add-drop multiplexers (ADMs) are the most common type of network elements. Traditional ADMs were designed to support one of the network architectures, though new generation systems can often support several architectures, sometimes simultaneously. ADMs traditionally have a &quot;high-speed side&quot; (where the full line rate signal is supported), and a &quot;low-speed side&quot;, which can consist of electrical as well as optical interfaces. The low-speed side takes in low-speed signals, which are multiplexed by the network element and sent out from the high-speed side, or vice versa.

===Digital cross connect system===
Recent digital cross connect systems (DCSs or DXCs) support numerous high-speed signals, and allow for cross-connection of DS1s, DS3s and even STS-3s/12c and so on, from any input to any output. Advanced DCSs can support numerous subtending rings simultaneously.

==Network architectures==
SONET and SDH have a limited number of architectures defined. These architectures allow for efficient bandwidth usage as well as protection, i.e. the ability to transmit traffic even when part of the network has failed, and are fundamental to the worldwide deployment of SONET and SDH for moving digital traffic. Every SDH/SONET connection on the optical physical layer uses two optical fibers, regardless of the transmission speed.

===Linear Automatic Protection Switching===
Linear Automatic Protection Switching (APS), also known as &quot;1+1&quot;, involves four fibers: two working fibers (one in each direction), and two protection fibers. Switching is based on the line state, and may be unidirectional (with each direction switching independently), or bidirectional (where the network elements at each end negotiate so that both directions are generally carried on the same pair of fibers).

===Unidirectional path-switched ring===
In unidirectional path-switched rings (UPSRs), two redundant (path-level) copies of protected traffic are sent in either direction around a ring. A selector at the egress node determines which copy has the highest quality, and uses that copy, thus coping if one copy deteriorates due to a broken fiber or other failure. 

UPSRs tend to sit nearer to the edge of a network, and as such are sometimes called &quot;collector rings&quot;. Because the same data is sent around the ring in both directions, the total capacity of a UPSR is equal to the line rate &quot;N&quot; of the OC-&quot;N&quot; ring. For example, in an OC-3 ring with 3 STS-1s used to transport 3 DS-3s from ingress node &quot;A&quot; to the egress node &quot;D&quot;, 100 percent of the ring bandwidth (&quot;N&quot;=3) would be consumed by nodes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot;. Any other nodes on the ring could only act as pass-through nodes. The SDH equivalent of UPSR is &quot;subnetwork connection protection&quot; (SNCP); SNCP does not impose a ring topology, but may also be used in mesh topologies.

===Bidirectional line-switched ring===
Bidirectional line-switched ring (BLSR) comes in two varieties: two-fiber BLSR and four-fiber BLSR. BLSRs switch at the line layer. Unlike UPSR, BLSR does not send redundant copies from ingress to egress. Rather, the ring nodes adjacent to the failure reroute the traffic &quot;the long way&quot; around the ring on the protection fibers. BLSRs trade cost and complexity for bandwidth efficiency, as well as the ability to support &quot;extra traffic&quot; that can be pre-empted when a protection switching event occurs. In four-fiber ring, either single node failures, or multiple line failures can be supported, since a failure or maintenance action on one line causes the protection fiber connecting two nodes to be used rather than looping it around the ring.

BLSRs can operate within a metropolitan region or, often, will move traffic between municipalities. Because a BLSR does not send redundant copies from ingress to egress, the total bandwidth that a BLSR can support is not limited to the line rate &quot;N&quot; of the OC-&quot;N&quot; ring, and can actually be larger than &quot;N&quot; depending upon the traffic pattern on the ring. 

In the best case, all traffic is between adjacent nodes. The worst case is when all traffic on the ring egresses from a single node, i.e., the BLSR is serving as a collector ring. In this case, the bandwidth that the ring can support is equal to the line rate &quot;N&quot; of the OC-&quot;N&quot; ring. This is why BLSRs are seldom, if ever, deployed in collector rings, but often deployed in inter-office rings. The SDH equivalent of BLSR is called &quot;Multiplex Section-Shared Protection Ring&quot; (MS-SPRING).

==Synchronization==
Clock sources used for synchronization in telecommunications networks are rated by quality, commonly called a &quot;stratum&quot;. Typically, a network element uses the highest quality stratum available to it, which can be determined by monitoring the synchronization status messages (SSM) of selected clock sources.

Synchronization sources available to a network element are:
;Local external timing
:This is generated by an atomic cesium clock or a satellite-derived clock by a device in the same central office as the network element. The interface is often a DS1, with sync-status messages supplied by the clock and placed into the DS1 overhead.
;Line-derived timing
:A network element can choose (or be configured) to derive its timing from the line-level, by monitoring the S1 sync-status bytes to ensure quality.
;Holdover
:As a last resort, in the absence of higher quality timing, a network element can go into a &quot;holdover&quot; mode until higher-quality external timing becomes available again. In this mode, the network element uses its own timing circuits as a reference.

===Timing loops===
A timing loop occurs when network elements in a network are each deriving their timing from other network elements, without any of them being a &quot;master&quot; timing source. This network loop will eventually see its own timing &quot;float away&quot; from any external networks, causing mysterious bit errors—and ultimately, in the worst cases, massive loss of traffic. The source of these kinds of errors can be hard to diagnose. In general, a network that has been properly configured should never find itself in a timing loop, but some classes of silent failures could nevertheless cause this issue.

==Next-generation SONET/SDH==
SONET/SDH development was originally driven by the need to transport multiple PDH signals—like DS1, E1, DS3, and E3—along with other groups of multiplexed 64 kbit/s pulse-code modulated voice traffic. The ability to transport ATM traffic was another early application. In order to support large ATM bandwidths, concatenation was developed, whereby smaller multiplexing containers (e.g., STS-1) are inversely multiplexed to build up a larger container (e.g., STS-3c) to support large data-oriented pipes.

One problem with traditional concatenation, however, is inflexibility. Depending on the data and voice traffic mix that must be carried, there can be a large amount of unused bandwidth left over, due to the fixed sizes of concatenated containers. For example, fitting a 100 Mbit/s Fast Ethernet connection inside a 155 Mbit/s STS-3c container leads to considerable waste. More important is the need for all intermediate network elements to support newly introduced concatenation sizes. This problem was overcome with the introduction of Virtual Concatenation.

Virtual concatenation (VCAT) allows for a more arbitrary assembly of lower-order multiplexing containers, building larger containers of fairly arbitrary size (e.g., 100 Mbit/s) without the need for intermediate network elements to support this particular form of concatenation. Virtual concatenation leverages the X.86 or Generic Framing Procedure (GFP) protocols in order to map payloads of arbitrary bandwidth into the virtually concatenated container.

The Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme (LCAS) allows for dynamically changing the bandwidth via dynamic virtual concatenation, multiplexing containers based on the short-term bandwidth needs in the network.

The set of next-generation SONET/SDH protocols that enable Ethernet transport is referred to as Ethernet over SONET/SDH (EoS).

==End of life and retirement==
SONET/SDH was used by internet access providers for large customers, and is no longer competitive in the supply of private circuits. Development has stagnated for the last decade (2020) and both suppliers of equipment and operators of SONET/SDH networks are migrating to other technologies such as OTN and wide area Ethernet.

British Telecom has recently (March 2020) closed down their KiloStream and Mega Stream products which were the last large scale uses of the BT SDH. BT has also ceased new connections to their SDH network which indicates withdrawal of services soon.

<text>Yorkshire pudding is a baked pudding made from a batter of eggs, flour, and milk or water. A common English side dish, it is a versatile food that can be served in numerous ways depending on its ingredients, size, and the accompanying components of the meal. As a first course, it can be served with onion gravy. For a main course, it may be served with meat and gravy — traditionally roast beef — as part of the traditional Sunday roast, but can also be filled with foods such as bangers and mash to make a meal. Sausages can be added to make toad in the hole. In some parts of England, (especially the Midlands) the Yorkshire pudding can be eaten as a dessert, with a sweet sauce. The 18th-century cookery writer Hannah Glasse was the first to use the term &quot;Yorkshire pudding&quot; in print.

Yorkshire puddings are similar to Dutch baby pancakes, and to popovers, an American light roll made from an egg batter.

==History==


When wheat flour began to come into common use for making cakes and puddings, cooks in northern England (Yorkshire) devised a means of making use of the fat that dropped into the dripping pan to cook a batter pudding while the meat roasted. In 1737, a recipe for &quot;a dripping pudding&quot; was published in Sir Alexander William George Cassey&#x27;s book &quot;The Whole Duty of a Woman&quot;:

Similar instructions were published during 1747 in the book &quot;The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy&quot; by Hannah Glasse, with the name &#x27;Yorkshire pudding&#x27;. It was she who renamed the original version, known as Dripping Pudding, which had been cooked in England for centuries, although these puddings were much flatter than the puffy versions made in modern times. William Sitwell suggests that the pudding got the name &#x27;Yorkshire&#x27; due to the region&#x27;s association with coal and the higher temperatures this produced which helped to make the batter crisper.

Originally, the Yorkshire pudding was served as a first course with thick gravy to dull the appetite with the low-cost ingredients so that the diners would not eat so much of the more expensive meat in the next course. Because the rich gravy from the roast meat drippings was used with the first course, the main meat and vegetable course was often served with a parsley or white sauce. In poorer households, the pudding was often served as the only course. Using dripping, a simple meal was made with flour, eggs and milk. This was traditionally eaten with a gravy or sauce, to moisten the pudding.

The Yorkshire pudding is meant to rise. The Royal Society of Chemistry suggested in 2008 that &quot;A Yorkshire pudding isn&#x27;t a Yorkshire pudding if it is less than tall&quot;.

==Baking method==
Yorkshire pudding is made by pouring a batter — made from milk, flour and eggs — into hot beef dripping, lard, or other rendered fat, (from which it gains its flavour), in a preheated baking pan (ramekins or muffin tins in the case of miniature puddings) and baking in a hot oven. They can also be baked in cast-iron frying pans or similar. 

A basic equal-part batter recipe uses 200 ml flour and 200 ml milk with four eggs (also 200 ml). Sometimes a small quantity of baking powder is added to aid the pudding to rise during baking. Replacing the milk with water produces a lighter, crisper, but less sweet pudding. 

A 1926 recipe involves covering the pudding with greaseproof paper to steam it and then serving it with jam, butter and sugar.

==Yorkshire Pudding Day==
National Yorkshire Pudding Day has been celebrated on the first Sunday in February in Britain since 2007. It is celebrated on 13 October in the United States.

<text>Reality televisionis a genre of television programming that documents purportedly unscripted real-life situations, often starring ordinary people rather than professional actors. Reality television emerged as a distinct genre in the early 1990s with shows such as &quot;The Real World&quot;, then achieved prominence in the early 2000s with the success of the series &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;Idol&quot;, and &quot;Big Brother&quot;, all of which became global franchises. Reality television shows tend to be interspersed with &quot;confessionals&quot;, short interview segments in which cast members reflect on or provide context for the events being depicted on-screen; this is most commonly seen in American reality television. Competition-based reality shows typically feature the gradual elimination of participants, either by a panel of judges, by the viewership of the show, or by the contestants themselves.

Documentaries, television news, sports television, talk shows, and traditional game shows are generally not classified as reality television. Some genres of television programming that predate the reality television boom have been retroactively classified as reality television, including hidden camera shows, talent-search shows, documentary series about ordinary people, high-concept game shows, home improvement shows, and court shows featuring real-life cases and issues.

Reality television has faced significant criticism since its rise in popularity. Critics argue that reality television shows do not accurately reflect reality, in ways both implicit (participants being placed in artificial situations), and deceptive (misleading editing, participants being coached on behavior, storylines generated ahead of time, scenes being staged). Some shows have been accused of rigging the favorite or underdog to win. Other criticisms of reality television shows include that they are intended to humiliate or exploit participants; that they make stars out of untalented people unworthy of fame, infamous figures, or both; and that they glamorize vulgarity.

== History ==
Television formats portraying ordinary people in unscripted situations are almost as old as the television medium itself. Producer-host Allen Funt&#x27;s &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, in which unsuspecting people were confronted with funny, unusual situations and filmed with hidden cameras, first aired in 1948. In the 21st century, the series is often considered a prototype of reality television programming.

=== 1940s–1950s ===
In the early 1940s the young German television station, named after &quot;Paul Nipkow&quot; had staged a show in which a young couple acted as model Aryans and presented their everyday lives without a script to the camera
(&quot;Familienchroniken - Ein Abend mit Hans und Gelli&quot;). Even though it was clearly Nazi propaganda and the episodes were certainly affected by censorship, in recent years the show has been presented more frequently as the oldest reality TV show in the world.

Precedents for television that portrayed people in unscripted situations began in the late 1940s. &quot;Queen for a Day&quot; (1945–1964) was an early example of reality-based television. The 1946 television game show &quot;Cash and Carry&quot; sometimes featured contestants performing stunts. Debuting in 1948, Allen Funt&#x27;s hidden camera show &quot;Candid Camera&quot; (based on his previous 1947 radio show, &quot;The Candid Microphone&quot;) broadcast unsuspecting ordinary people reacting to pranks. In 1948, talent search shows, such as &quot;Ted Mack&#x27;s Original Amateur Hour&quot; and &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;, featured amateur competitors and audience voting. In the 1950s, game shows &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; and &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; involved contestants in wacky competitions, stunts, and practical jokes. &quot;Confession&quot; was a crime and police show that aired from June 1958 to January 1959, with interviewer Jack Wyatt questioning criminals from assorted backgrounds. The radio series &quot;Nightwatch&quot; (1951–1955) tape-recorded the daily activities of Culver City, California police officers. The series &quot;You Asked for It&quot; (1950–1959) incorporated audience involvement by basing episodes around requests sent in by postcard from viewers.

=== 1960s–1970s ===
First broadcast in the United Kingdom in 1964, the Granada Television documentary &quot;Seven Up!&quot; broadcast interviews with a dozen ordinary 7-year-olds from a broad cross-section of society and inquired about their reactions to everyday life. Every seven years, the filmmaker created a new film documenting the lives of the same individuals during the intervening period. Titled the Up Series, episodes included &quot;7 Plus Seven&quot;, &quot;21 Up&quot;, etc.; it is still ongoing. The program was structured as a series of interviews with no element of the plot. By virtue of the attention paid to the participants, it effectively turned ordinary people into a type of celebrity, especially after they became adults.

The series &quot;The American Sportsman&quot;, which ran from 1965 to 1986 on ABC in the United States, would typically feature one or more celebrities, and sometimes their family members, being accompanied by a camera crew on an outdoor adventure, such as hunting, fishing, hiking, scuba diving, rock climbing, wildlife photography, horseback riding, race car driving, and the like, with most of the resulting action and dialogue being unscripted, except for the narration.

In the 1966 Direct Cinema film &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot;, Andy Warhol filmed various acquaintances with no direction given. The &quot;Radio Times Guide to Film 2007&quot; said that the film was &quot;to blame for reality television&quot;.

In 1969, the British rock group the Beatles were filmed for a month during the recording sessions which would become their album &quot;Let It Be&quot; and released the homonymous film the following year. In 2021, director Peter Jackson created an eight-hour, three-episode television series entitled &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot;.
The 12-part 1973 PBS series &quot;An American Family&quot; showed a nuclear family (filmed in 1971) going through a divorce; unlike many later reality shows, it was more or less documentary in purpose and style. In 1974 a counterpart program, &quot;The Family&quot;, was made in the UK, following the working-class Wilkins family of Reading. Other forerunners of modern reality television were the 1970s productions of Chuck Barris: &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, and &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, all of which featured participants who were eager to sacrifice some of their privacy and dignity in a televised competition.

The 1976–1980 BBC series &quot;The Big Time&quot; featured a different amateur in some field (cooking, comedy, football, etc.) trying to succeed professionally in that field, with help from notable experts. The 15-episode series is credited with starting the career of Sheena Easton, who was selected to appear in the episode showing an aspiring pop singer trying to enter the music business.

In 1978, &quot;Living in the Past&quot; had amateurs participating in a re-enactment of life in an Iron Age English village.

=== 1980s–1990s ===
Producer George Schlatter capitalized on the advent of videotape to create &quot;Real People&quot;, a surprise hit for NBC, and it ran from 1979 to 1984. The success of &quot;Real People&quot; was quickly copied by ABC with &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible&quot;, a stunt show produced by Alan Landsburg and co-hosted by Fran Tarkenton; CBS&#x27;s entry into the genre was &quot;That&#x27;s My Line&quot;, a series hosted by Bob Barker. The Canadian series &quot;Thrill of a Lifetime&quot;, a fantasies-fulfilled reality show, originally ran from 1982 to 1988. It was revived from 2001 to 2003. In 1985, underwater cinematographer Al Giddings teamed with former Miss Universe Shawn Weatherly on the NBC series &quot;Oceanquest&quot;, which chronicled Weatherly&#x27;s adventures scuba diving in various exotic locales. Weatherly was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in informational programming.
&quot;COPS&quot;, which first aired in the spring of 1989 on Fox and was developed due to the need for new programming during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, showed police officers on duty apprehending criminals. It introduced the camcorder look and cinéma vérité feel of much of later reality television. The 1991 television documentary on &quot;typical American high schoolers&quot;, &quot;Yearbook&quot;, focused on seniors attending Glenbard West High School, in Glen Ellyn, Illinois and broadcast prime-time on Fox.

The series &quot;Nummer 28&quot;, which aired on Dutch television in 1991, originated the concept of putting strangers together in a limited environment for an extended period of time and recording the drama that ensued. &quot;Nummer 28&quot; also pioneered many of the stylistic conventions that have since become standard in reality television shows, including extensive use of soundtrack music and the interspersing of events on screen with after-the-fact &quot;confessionals&quot; recorded by cast members, which serve as narration. &quot;Nummer 28&quot; became the model for many later series of &quot;Big Brother&quot; and its clones, and Peter Weir&#x27;s full-length film &quot;The Truman Show&quot;. One year later, the same concept was used by MTV in its new series &quot;The Real World&quot;. &quot;Nummer 28&quot; creator Erik Latour has long claimed that &quot;The Real World&quot; was directly inspired by his show. But the producers of &quot;The Real World&quot; have said that their direct inspiration was &quot;An American Family&quot;. According to television commentator Charlie Brooker, this type of reality television was enabled by the advent of computer-based non-linear editing systems for video (such as produced by Avid Technology) in 1989. These systems made it easy to quickly edit hours of video footage into a usable form, something that had been very difficult to do before (film, which was easy to edit, was too expensive to use in shooting enough hours on a regular basis).

&quot;Sylvania Waters&quot; (1992) was an Australian show that depicted a family, similar in concept to &quot;An American Family&quot;.

The 1994–95 O. J. Simpson murder case, during which live network television followed suspect Simpson for 90 minutes being chased by police, has been described as a seminal moment in reality television. Networks interrupted their regular television programming for months for coverage of the trial and related events. Because of Simpson&#x27;s status as a top athlete and celebrity, the brutal nature of the murders, and issues of race and class in Los Angeles celebrity culture, the sensational case dominated ratings and the public conversation.

Many reality television stars of the 2000s and 2010s have direct or indirect connections to people involved in the case, most notably Kim Kardashian, daughter of defense attorney Robert Kardashian, and several of her relatives and associates.

The series &quot;Expedition Robinson&quot;, created by television producer Charlie Parsons, which first aired in 1997 in Sweden (and was later produced in a large number of other countries as &quot;Survivor&quot;), added to the &quot;Nummer 28&quot;/&quot;Real World&quot; template the idea of competition and elimination. Cast members or contestants battled against each other and were removed from the show until only one winner remained (these shows are now sometimes called elimination shows). &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;, a program that began in the UK in 1996, showed couples redecorating each other&#x27;s houses, and was the first reality show with a self-improvement or makeover theme. The dating reality show &quot;Streetmate&quot; premiered in the UK in 1998. Originally created by Gabe Sachs as &quot;Street Match&quot;, it was a flop in the United States. But the show was revamped in the UK by Tiger Aspect Productions and became a cult hit. The production team from the original series later created the popular reality shows &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, &quot;Location, Location, Location&quot;, and the revamped &quot;MasterChef&quot;, among others. The 1980s and 1990s were also a time when tabloid talk shows became more popular. Many of these featured the same types of unusual or dysfunctional guests who would later become popular as cast members of reality shows.

=== 2000s ===
Reality television became globally popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the successes of the &quot;Big Brother&quot; and &quot;Survivor/Expedition Robinson&quot; franchises. In the United States, reality television programs suffered a temporary decline in viewership in 2001, leading some entertainment industry columnists to speculate that the genre was a temporary fad that had run its course. Reality shows that suffered from low ratings included &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; (although the show has since recovered and is in its 32nd edition), &quot;Lost&quot; (unrelated to the better-known serial drama of the same name) and &quot;The Mole&quot; (which was successful in other countries). But stronghold shows &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;American Idol&quot; continued to thrive: both topped the U.S. season-average television ratings in the 2000s. &quot;Survivor&quot; led the ratings in 2001–02, and &quot;Idol&quot; has the longest hold on the No. 1 rank in the American television ratings, dominating over all other primetime programs and other television series in the overall viewership tallies for eight consecutive years, from the 2003–2004 to the 2010–2011 television seasons.

Another trend was to combine reality TV with a social history angle usually by having contestants taken back to various time periods primarily to see how millennials would cope without modern technology. Examples included &quot;The 1900 House&quot;, &quot;Bad Lads&#x27; Army&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;ll Teach &#x27;Em&quot;. In addition to those was a series consisting of archeologists and historians running a farm though various historical periods, most notably &quot;Victorian Farm&quot;.
Internationally, a number of shows created in the late 1990s and 2000s have had massive global success. Reality-television franchises created during that time that have had more than 30 international adaptations each include the singing competition franchises &quot;Idols&quot;, &quot;Star Academy&quot; and &quot;The X Factor&quot;, other competition franchises &quot;Survivor/Expedition Robinson&quot;, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;, &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot;, &quot;Got Talent&quot;, &quot;Top Model&quot;, &quot;MasterChef&quot;, &quot;Project Runway&quot; and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, and the investment franchise &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot;. Several &quot;reality game shows&quot; from the same period have had even greater success, including &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, and &quot;Weakest Link&quot;, with over 50 international adaptions each. (All but four of these franchises, &quot;Top Model&quot;, &quot;Project Runway&quot;, &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; and &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot;, were created by either British producers or the Dutch production company Endemol. Although &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot; originated in Japan, most of its adaptations are based on the British version.) In India, the competition show &quot;Indian Idol&quot; was the most popular television program for its first six seasons.

During the 2000s, several cable networks, including Bravo, A&amp;E, E!, TLC, History, VH1, and MTV, changed their programming to feature mostly reality television series. In addition, three cable channels were started around that time that were devoted exclusively to reality television: Fox Reality in the United States, which operated from 2005 to 2010; Global Reality Channel in Canada, which lasted two years from 2010 to 2012; and CBS Reality (formerly known as Reality TV and then Zone Reality) in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which has run from 1999 to the present.

During the early part of the 2000s, network executives expressed concern that reality-television programming was limited in its appeal for DVD reissue and syndication. But DVDs for reality shows sold briskly; &quot;Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, &quot;Project Runway&quot;, and &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; all ranked in the top DVDs sold on Amazon.com. In the mid-2000s, DVDs of &quot;The Simple Life&quot; outranked scripted shows such as &quot;The O.C.&quot; and &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. Syndication, however, has been problematic; shows such as &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, &quot;COPS&quot;, and &quot;Wife Swap&quot;, in which each episode is self-contained, can be rerun fairly easily, but usually only on cable television or during the daytime (&quot;COPS&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; being exceptions). Season-long competitions, such as &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, &quot;Survivor&quot;, and &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; generally perform more poorly and usually must be rerun in marathons to draw the necessary viewers to make it worthwhile. (Even in these cases, it is not always successful: the first ten seasons of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; were picked up by GSN in 2012 and was run in marathon format, but attracted low viewership and had very poor ratings). Another option is to create documentaries around series, including extended interviews with the participants and outtakes not seen in the original airings; the syndicated series &quot;American Idol Rewind&quot; is an example of this strategy.

&quot;COPS&quot; has had huge success in syndication, direct response sales, and DVD. A Fox staple since 1989, &quot;COPS&quot; has, as of 2013 (when it moved to cable channel Spike), outlasted all competing scripted police shows. Another series that had wide success is &quot;Cheaters&quot;, which has been running since 2000 in the U.S. and is syndicated in over 100 countries worldwide. In 2001, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences added the reality genre to the Emmy Awards in the category of Outstanding Reality Program. In 2003, to better differentiate between competition and informational reality programs, a second category, Outstanding Reality-Competition Program, was added. In 2008, a third category, Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program, was added. In 2007, the web series &quot;The Next Internet Millionaire&quot; appeared; it was a competition show based in part on &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, and was billed as the world&#x27;s first Internet reality show.

=== 2010s ===

In 2010, the Dutch singing competition show &quot;The Voice of Holland&quot;, created by John de Mol Jr., premiered; it added to the singing competition template the twist that judges could not see contestants during the initial audition round, and could judge them only by their voice. The show was an instant success, and spawned an entire franchise, &quot;The Voice&quot;, which has been highly successful, with almost 50 international adaptations.

&quot;The Tester&quot; (2010–2012) was the first reality television show aired over a video game console.

By 2012, many of the long-running reality television show franchises in the United States, such as &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, had begun to see declining ratings. However, reality television as a whole remained durable in the U.S., with hundreds of shows across many channels. In 2012, &quot;New York&quot; Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Vulture&quot; blog published a humorous Venn diagram showing popular themes across American reality shows then running, including shows set in the U.S. states of Alaska, Louisiana and Texas, shows about cakes, weddings and pawnbrokers, and shows, usually competition-based, whose title includes the word &quot;Wars&quot;.

&quot;Duck Dynasty&quot; (2012–2017), which focused on the Robertson family that founded Duck Commander, in 2013 became the most popular reality series in U.S. cable television history. Its fourth-season premiere was viewed by nearly 12 million viewers in the United States, most of which were in rural markets. Its rural audience share ranked in the 30s, an extremely high number for any series, broadcast or cable.

Following from the &quot;1900 House&quot; format, the BBC produced a series called &quot;Back in Time for Tea&quot; in which a family would experience tea time for various decades.

In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; again noted a stagnation in reality television programs&#x27; ratings in the U.S., which they attributed to &quot;The diminishing returns of cable TV&#x27;s sea of reality sameness&quot;. They noted that a number of networks that featured reality programming, including Bravo and E!, were launching their first scripted shows, and others, including AMC, were abandoning plans to launch further reality programs; though they clarified that the genre as a whole &quot;isn&#x27;t going anywhere.&quot; Ratings and profits from reality TV continued to decline in the late 2010s.

The South Korean competition show &quot;I Can See Your Voice&quot;, which premiered in 2015, showed guest judges attempting to guess which of a group of contestants could sing, and which could not, without hearing them sing. The show was successful, and spawned several imitators, most notably &quot;King of Mask Singer&quot; several months later. &quot;King of Mask Singer&quot; was a more traditional singing competition show, but with the wrinkle that the contestants were celebrities who remained masked until they were removed from the show, adding an element of guesswork to the competition. The two shows both spawned successful international franchises, &quot;I Can See Your Voice&quot; and &quot;Masked Singer&quot;, respectively. &quot;Masked Singer&quot; has been especially popular, with over 50 local adaptations; its American adaptation was the third highest-rated series overall of both the 2018–19 and 2019–20 television seasons. The success of the two franchises has led to other globally-syndicated franchises of reality competitions based around guesswork, such as &quot;Game of Talents&quot; (which began in Spain in 2019) and &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot; (which began in the United States in 2020).

Specialist skill-based TV competitions became popular during this decade with such programs like &quot;The Great British Bake-Off&quot;, &quot;Lego Masters&quot;, &quot;The Great British Sewing Bee&quot; and &quot;Forged in Fire&quot; shown.

=== 2020s ===
Television development across all genres was impacted in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced many reality competition series to suspend production (and in some cases curtail a competition already in progress, such as Canadian and Malayalam versions of &quot;Big Brother&quot;), until such time that production could recommence with appropriate health and safety protocols approved by local authorities. Due to their quicker turnaround times, the U.S. networks used reality series and other unscripted content (including those delayed from their summer lineups) to fill gaps in their schedules while the production of scripted programming resumed.

== Subgenres ==
There have been various attempts to classify reality television shows into different subgenres:
* A 2006 study proposed six subgenres: romance, crime, informational, reality-drama, competition or game, and talent.
* A 2007 study proposed five subgenres: infotainment, docusoap, lifestyle, reality game shows, and lifestyle experiment programs.
* A 2009 study proposed eight subgenres: &quot;gamedocs&quot;, dating programs, makeover programs, docusoaps, talent contests, court programs, reality sitcoms, and celebrity variations of other programs.

Another categorization divides reality television into two types: shows that purport to document real life, and shows that place participants in new circumstances. In a 2003 paper, theorists Elisabeth Klaus and Stephanie Lücke referred to the former category as &quot;docusoaps&quot;, which consist of &quot;narrative reality&quot;, and the latter category as &quot;reality soaps&quot;, which consist of &quot;performative reality&quot;. Since 2014, the Primetime Emmy Awards have used a similar classification, with separate awards for &quot;unstructured reality&quot; and &quot;structured reality&quot; programs, as well as a third award for &quot;reality-competition&quot; programs.

=== Documentary-style ===
In many reality television programs, camera shooting and footage editing give the viewer the impression that they are passive observers following people going about their daily personal and professional activities; this style of filming is sometimes referred to as fly on the wall, observational documentary or factual television. Story &quot;plots&quot; are often constructed via editing or planned situations, with the results resembling soap operas – hence the terms &quot;docusoap&quot; and &quot;docudrama&quot;. Documentary-style programs give viewers a private look into the lives of the subjects.

Within documentary-style reality television are several subcategories or variants:

==== Soap-opera style ====
Although the term &quot;docusoap&quot; has been used for many documentary-style reality television shows, there have been shows that have deliberately tried to mimic the appearance and structure of soap operas. Such shows often focus on a close-knit group of people and their shifting friendships and romantic relationships. One highly influential such series was the American 2004–2006 series &quot;Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County,&quot; which attempted to specifically mimic the primetime soap opera &quot;The O.C.&quot;, which had begun airing in 2003. &quot;Laguna Beach&quot; had a more drama-like feel than any previous reality television show, through the use of higher-quality lighting and cameras, voice-over narration instead of on-screen &quot;confessionals&quot;, and slower pacing. &quot;Laguna Beach&quot; led to several spinoff series, most notably the 2006–2010 series &quot;The Hills&quot;. It also inspired various other series, including the highly successful British series &quot;The Only Way Is Essex&quot; and &quot;Made in Chelsea&quot;, and the Australian series &quot;Freshwater Blue&quot;.

Due to their dramatized feel, many of these shows have been accused of being pre-scripted, more so than other reality television shows have. The producers of &quot;The Only Way Is Essex&quot; and &quot;Made in Chelsea&quot; have admitted to coaching cast members on what to say in order to draw more emotion from each scene, although they insist that the underlying stories are real.

Another highly successful group of soap-opera-style shows is the &quot;Real Housewives&quot; franchise, which began with &quot;The Real Housewives of Orange County&quot; in 2006 and has since spawned nearly twenty other series, in the U.S. and internationally. The franchise has an older cast and different personal dynamics than that of &quot;Laguna Beach&quot; and its imitators, as well as lower production values, but similarly is meant to resemble scripted soap operas – in this case, the television series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; and &quot;Peyton Place&quot;.

A notable subset of such series focus on a group of women who are romantically connected to male celebrities; these include &quot;Basketball Wives&quot; (2010), &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop&quot; (2011), &quot;Hollywood Exes&quot; (2012), &quot;Ex-Wives of Rock&quot; (2012) and &quot;WAGS&quot; (2015). Most of these shows have had spin-offs in multiple locations.
There are also fly-on-the-wall-style shows directly involving celebrities. Often these show a celebrity going about their everyday life: notable examples include &quot;The Anna Nicole Show&quot;, &quot;The Osbournes&quot;, &quot;Gene Simmons Family Jewels&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot; and &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot;. VH1 in the mid-2000s had an entire block of such shows, known as &quot;Celebreality&quot;. Shows such as these are often created with the idea of promoting a celebrity product or upcoming project.

==== Subcultures ====
Some documentary-style shows shed light on rarely seen cultures and lifestyles. One example is shows about people with disabilities or people who have unusual physical circumstances, such as the American series &quot;Push Girls&quot; and &quot;Little People, Big World&quot;, and the British programmes &quot;Beyond Boundaries&quot;, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Missing Top Model&quot;, &quot;The Undateables&quot; and &quot;Seven Dwarves&quot;.

Another example is shows that portray the lives of ethnic or religious minorities. Examples include &quot;All-American Muslim&quot; (Lebanese-American Muslims), &quot;Shahs of Sunset&quot; (affluent Persian-Americans), &quot;Sister Wives&quot; (polygamists from a Mormon splinter group), &quot;Breaking Amish&quot; and &quot;Amish Mafia&quot; (the Amish), and &quot;Big Fat Gypsy Weddings&quot; and its spinoffs (Romani people).

The &quot;Real Housewives&quot; franchise offers a window into the lives of social-striving urban and suburban housewives. Many shows focus on wealth and conspicuous consumption, including &quot;Platinum Weddings&quot;, and &quot;My Super Sweet 16&quot;, which documented huge coming of age celebrations thrown by wealthy parents. Conversely, the highly successful &quot;Here Comes Honey Boo Boo&quot; and &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot; are set in poorer rural areas of the Southern United States.

==== Professional activities ====
Some documentary-style shows portray professionals either going about day-to-day business or performing an entire project over the course of a series. One early example (and the longest running reality show of any genre) is &quot;Cops&quot;, which debuted in 1989. Other such shows specifically relating to law enforcement include &quot;The First 48&quot;, &quot;Dog the Bounty Hunter&quot;, &quot;Police Stop!&quot;, &quot;Traffic Cops&quot;, &quot;Border Security&quot; and &quot;Motorway Patrol&quot;.

Shows set at a specific place of business include &quot;American Chopper&quot;, &quot;Miami Ink&quot; and its spinoffs, &quot;Bikini Barbershop&quot; and &quot;Lizard Lick Towing&quot;.

Shows that show people working in the same non-business location include &quot;Airport&quot; and &quot;Bondi Rescue&quot;.

Shows that portray a set of people in the same line of work, occasionally competing with each other, include &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;, &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot; and &quot;Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles&quot; and its spinoffs.

==== Financial transactions and appraisals ====
One notable subset of shows about professional activities is those in which the professionals haggle and engage in financial transactions, often over unique or rare items whose value must first be appraised. Two such shows, both of which have led to multiple spinoff shows, are &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; (about pawn shops) and &quot;American Pickers&quot;. Other shows, while based around such financial transactions, also show elements of its main cast members&#x27; personal and professional lives; these shows include &quot;Hardcore Pawn&quot; and &quot;Comic Book Men&quot;. Such shows have some antecedent in the British series &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, which began airing in 1979 and has since spawned numerous international versions, although that show includes only appraisals and does not include bargaining or other dramatic elements.

==== Special living environment ====
Some documentary-style programs place cast members, who in most cases previously did not know each other, in staged living environments; &quot;The Real World&quot; was the originator of this format. In almost every other such type of programming, cast members are given specific challenges or obstacles to overcome. &quot;Road Rules&quot;, which first aired in 1995 as a spin-off of &quot;The Real World&quot;, created a show structure where the cast would travel to various countries performing challenges for prizes.

&quot;Big Brother&quot; is probably the best-known program of this type in the world, with around 50 international versions having been produced. Other shows in this category, such as &quot;The 1900 House&quot; and &quot;Lads&#x27; Army&quot;, involve historical re-enactment, with cast members living and working as people of a specific time and place. 2001&#x27;s &quot;Temptation Island&quot; achieved some notoriety by placing several couples on an island surrounded by single people in order to test the couples&#x27; commitment to each other. &quot;The Challenge&quot; has contestants living together in an overseas residence, and has been around for over 30 seasons. The format of each season changes, however the main premise of the series involves a daily challenge, nomination process and elimination round. &quot;U8TV: The Lofters&quot; combined the &quot;special living environment&quot; format with the &quot;professional activity&quot; format noted earlier; in addition to living together in a loft, each member of the show&#x27;s cast was hired to host a television program for a Canadian cable channel.

&quot;The Simple Life&quot;, &quot;Tommy Lee Goes to College&quot; and &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; are all shows in which celebrities are put into an unnatural environment.

==== Court shows ====

Originally, court shows were all dramatized and staged programs, with actors playing the litigants, witnesses and lawyers. The cases were either reenactments of real-life cases or cases that were fictionalized altogether. Among examples of staged courtroom dramas are &quot;Famous Jury Trials&quot;, &quot;Your Witness&quot;, and the first two eras of &quot;Divorce Court&quot;. &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; revolutionized the genre by introducing the arbitration-based &quot;reality&quot; format in 1981, later adopted by the vast majority of court shows. The genre experienced a lull in programming after &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; was canceled in 1993, but then soared after the emergence of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; in 1996. This led to a slew of other reality court shows, such as &quot;Judge Mathis&quot;, &quot;Judge Joe Brown&quot;, &quot;Judge Alex&quot;, &quot;Judge Mills Lane&quot; and &quot;Judge Hatchett&quot;.

Though the litigants are legitimate, the &quot;judges&quot; in such shows are actually arbitrators, as these pseudo-judges are not actually presiding in a court of law. Typically, however, they are retired judges or at least individuals who have had some legal experience.

Courtroom programs are typically daytime television shows that air on weekdays.

==== Investments ====
The globally syndicated format &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot; shows a group of wealthy investors choosing whether or not to invest in a series of pitched startup companies and entrepreneurial ventures. The series &quot;Restaurant Startup&quot; similarly involves investors, but involves more of a game show element in which restaurant owners compete to prove their worth. The British series &quot;Show Me the Monet&quot; offers a twist in which artworks&#x27; artistic value, rather than their financial value, is appraised by a panel of judges, who determine whether each one will be featured at an exhibition.

==== Outdoor survival ====
Another subgenre places people in wild and challenging natural settings. This includes such shows as &quot;Survivorman&quot;, &quot;Man vs. Wild&quot;, &quot;Marooned with Ed Stafford&quot;, &quot;Naked and Afraid&quot; and &quot;Alaskan Bush People&quot;. The shows &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Get Out Alive with Bear Grylls&quot; combine outdoor survival with a competition format, although in &quot;Survivor&quot; the competition also involves social dynamics.

==== Self-improvement or makeover ====
Some reality television shows cover a person or group of people improving their lives. Sometimes the same group of people are covered over an entire season (as in &quot;The Swan&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;), but usually there is a new target for improvement in each episode. Despite differences in the content, the format is usually the same: first the show introduces the subjects in their current, less-than-ideal environment. Then the subjects meet with a group of experts, who give the subjects instructions on how to improve things; they offer aid and encouragement along the way. Finally, the subjects are placed back in their environment and they, along with their friends and family and the experts, appraise the changes that have occurred. Other self-improvement or makeover shows include &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;, &quot;Extreme Weight Loss&quot; and &quot;Fat March&quot; (which cover weight loss), &quot;Extreme Makeover&quot; (entire physical appearance), &quot;Queer Eye&quot;, &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;, &quot;How Do I Look?&quot;, &quot;Trinny &amp; Susannah Undress...&quot; and &quot;Snog Marry Avoid?&quot; (style and grooming), &quot;Supernanny&quot; (child-rearing), &quot;Made&quot; (life transformation), &quot;Tool Academy&quot; (relationship building) and &quot;Charm School&quot; and &quot;From G&#x27;s to Gents&quot; (self-improvement and manners).

The concept of self-improvement was taken to its extreme with the British show &quot;Life Laundry&quot;, in which people who had become hoarders, even living in squalor, were given professional assistance. The American television series &quot;Hoarders&quot; and &quot;&quot; follow similar premises, presenting interventions in the lives of people who suffer from compulsive hoarding. The British series &quot;Sort Your Life Out&quot;, presented by Stacey Solomon, is similar, but it also redesigns the participants&#x27; houses.

In one study, participants who admitted to watching more reality television were more likely to proceed with a desired plastic surgery than those who watched less.

==== Renovation ====
Some shows makeover part or all of a person&#x27;s living space, workspace, or vehicle. The American series &quot;This Old House&quot;, which debuted in 1979, features the start-to-finish renovation of different houses through a season; media critic Jeff Jarvis has speculated that it is &quot;the original reality TV show.&quot; The British show &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;, beginning in 1996 (later remade in the U.S. as &quot;Trading Spaces&quot;) was the first such renovation show that added a game show feel with different weekly contestants.

House renovation shows are a mainstay on the American and Canadian cable channel HGTV, whose renovation shows include the successful franchises &quot;Flip or Flop&quot;, &quot;Love It or List It&quot; and &quot;Property Brothers&quot;, as well as shows such as &quot;Debbie Travis&#x27; Facelift&quot;, &quot;Designed to Sell&quot; and &quot;Holmes on Homes&quot;. Non-HGTV shows in this category include &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; and &quot;While You Were Out&quot;.

&quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; and &quot;Overhaulin&#x27;&quot; show vehicles being rebuilt in a customized way.

==== Business improvement ====
In some shows, one or more experts try to improve a failing small business over the course of each episode. Examples that cover many types of business include &quot;We Mean Business&quot; and &quot;The Profit&quot;. Shows geared for a specific type of business include &quot;Ramsay&#x27;s Kitchen Nightmares&quot; and &quot;&quot; (for restaurants), &quot;Bar Rescue&quot; (for bars) and &quot;Hotel Hell&quot; (for hotels).

==== Social experiment ====
Another type of reality program is the social experiment that produces drama, conflict, and sometimes transformation. British TV series &quot;Wife Swap&quot;, which began in 2003, and has had many spinoffs in the UK and other countries, is a notable example. In the show, people with different values agree to live by each other&#x27;s social rules for a brief period of time. Other shows in this category include &quot;Trading Spouses&quot;, &quot;Bad Girls Club&quot; and &quot;Holiday Showdown&quot;. &quot;Faking It&quot; was a series where people had to learn a new skill and pass themselves off as experts in that skill. &quot;Shattered&quot; was a controversial 2004 UK series in which contestants competed for how long they could go without sleep. &quot;Solitary&quot; was a controversial 2006-2010 Fox Reality series that isolated contestants for weeks in solitary confinement pods with limited sleep, food and information while competing in elimination challenges ended by a quit button, causing winners to go on for much longer than needed as a blind gamble to not be the first person to quit.

The Dutch series &quot;De Verraders&quot;, adapted internationally as &quot;The Traitors&quot;, features contestants divided into two factions—the &quot;traitors&quot; and the &quot;faithful&quot;—and competing in challenges to build a cash jackpot awarded in the finale; three contestants secretly designated as &quot;traitors&quot; (which are known to the viewers) have the ability to secretly eliminate (&quot;murder&quot;) other contestants each night, while the remaining contestants try to figure out the identities of the traitors so they can attempt to &quot;banish&quot; them in elimination votes. The jackpot is split among the faithful if they eliminate all of the traitors, but is split among the traitors if they fail. 

==== Hidden cameras ====
Another type of reality programming features hidden cameras rolling when random passers-by encounter a staged situation. &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, which first aired on television in 1948, pioneered the format. Modern variants of this type of production include &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;, &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot;, &quot;Primetime: What Would You Do?&quot;, &quot;The Jamie Kennedy Experiment&quot; and &quot;Just for Laughs Gags&quot;. The series &quot;Scare Tactics&quot; and &quot;Room 401&quot; are hidden-camera programs in which the goal is to frighten contestants rather than just befuddle or amuse them. The Belgian hidden camera series &quot;Sorry voor alles&quot; subjects a contestant to various staged situations over a month-long period, designed to analyze their personality and how they respond. After the contestant is taken to a studio and let off the hook, they then answer observation questions related to the events for a chance to win prizes.

Not all hidden camera shows use strictly staged situations. For example, the syndicated program &quot;Cheaters&quot; purports to use hidden cameras to record suspected cheating partners, although the authenticity of the show has been questioned, and even refuted by some who have been featured on the series. Once the evidence has been gathered, the accuser confronts the cheating partner with the assistance of the host. In many special-living documentary programs, hidden cameras are set up all over the residence in order to capture moments missed by the regular camera crew, or intimate bedroom footage.

==== Supernatural and paranormal ====

Supernatural and paranormal reality shows such as &quot;MTV&#x27;s Fear&quot;, place participants into frightening situations which ostensibly involve paranormal phenomena such as ghosts, telekinesis or haunted houses. In series such as &quot;Celebrity Paranormal Project&quot;, the stated aim is investigation, and some series like &quot;Scariest Places on Earth&quot; challenge participants to survive the investigation; whereas others such as &quot;Paranormal State&quot; and &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; use a recurring crew of paranormal researchers. In general, the shows follow similar stylized patterns of night vision, surveillance, and hand held camera footage; odd angles; subtitles establishing place and time; desaturated imagery; and non-melodic soundtracks. Noting the trend in reality shows that take the paranormal at face value, &quot;New York Times&quot; culture editor Mike Hale characterized ghost hunting shows as &quot;pure theater&quot; and compared the genre to professional wrestling or softcore pornography for its formulaic, teasing approach.

=== Reality competition or game shows ===

Another subgenre of reality television is &quot;reality competition&quot;, &quot;reality playoffs&quot;, or so-called &quot;reality game shows&quot;, which follow the format of non-tournament elimination contests. Typically, participants are filmed competing to win a prize, often while living together in a confined environment. In many cases, participants are removed until only one person or team remains, who is then declared the winner. Usually this is done by eliminating participants one at a time (or sometimes two at a time, as an episodic twist due to the number of contestants involved and the length of a given season), through either disapproval voting or by voting for the most popular to win. Voting is done by the viewing audience, the show&#x27;s own participants, a panel of judges, or some combination of the three.

A well-known example of a reality-competition show is the globally syndicated &quot;Big Brother&quot;, in which cast members live together in the same house, with participants removed at regular intervals by either the viewing audience or, in the American version, by the participants themselves. There remains disagreement over whether talent-search shows such as the &quot;Idol&quot; series, the &quot;Got Talent&quot; series and the &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; series are truly reality television or just newer incarnations of shows such as &quot;Star Search&quot;. Although the shows involve a traditional talent search, the shows follow the reality-competition conventions of removing one or more contestants in every episode, allowing the public to vote on who is removed, and interspersing performances with video clips showing the contestants&#x27; &quot;back stories&quot;, their thoughts about the competition, their rehearsals and unguarded behind-the-scenes moments. Additionally, there is a good deal of unscripted interaction shown between contestants and judges. The American Primetime Emmy Awards have nominated both &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; for the Outstanding Reality-Competition Program Emmy.

Game shows like &quot;Weakest Link&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, &quot;American Gladiators&quot; and &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, which were popular in the 2000s, also lie in a gray area: like traditional game shows (e.g., &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;), the action takes place in an enclosed television studio over a short period of time; however, they have higher production values, more dramatic background music, and higher stakes than traditional shows (done either through putting contestants into physical danger or offering large cash prizes). In addition, there is more interaction between contestants and hosts, and in some cases, they feature reality-style contestant competition or elimination as well. These factors, as well as these shows&#x27; rise in global popularity at the same time as the arrival of the reality craze, have led to such shows often being grouped under both the reality television and game show umbrellas. 

There have been various hybrid reality-competition shows, like the worldwide-syndicated &quot;Star Academy&quot;, which combines the &quot;Big Brother&quot; and &quot;Idol&quot; formats, &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;, which combines competition with the self-improvement format, and &quot;American Inventor&quot;, which uses the &quot;Idol&quot; format for products instead of people. Some reality shows that aired mostly during the early 2000s, such as &quot;Popstars&quot;, &quot;Making the Band&quot; and &quot;Project Greenlight&quot;, devoted the first part of the season to selecting a winner, and the second part to showing that person or group of people working on a project. 

Popular variants of the competition-based format include the following:

==== Dating-based competition ====
Dating-based competition shows follow a contestant choosing one out of a group of suitors. Over the course of either a single episode or an entire season, suitors are eliminated until only the contestant and the final suitor remains. In the early 2000s, this type of reality show dominated the other genres on the major U.S. networks. Examples include &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, its spin-off &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;, &quot;Temptation Island&quot;, &quot;Average Joe&quot;, &quot;Flavor of Love&quot; (a dating show featuring rapper Flavor Flav that led directly and indirectly to over 10 spinoffs), &quot;The Cougar&quot; and &quot;Love in the Wild&quot;. In &quot;Married by America&quot;, contestants were chosen by viewer voting. This is one of the older variants of the format; shows such as &quot;The Dating Game&quot; that date to the 1960s had similar premises (though each episode was self-contained, and not the serial format of more modern shows). One of the more recent hits was &quot;Farmer Wants a Wife&quot;.

==== Job search ====

In this category, the competition revolves around a skill that contestants were pre-screened for. Competitors perform a variety of tasks based on that skill, are judged, and are then kept or removed by a single expert or a panel of experts. The show is usually presented as a job search of some kind, in which the prize for the winner includes a contract to perform that kind of work and an undisclosed salary, although the award can simply be a sum of money and ancillary prizes, like a cover article in a magazine. The show also features judges who act as counselors, mediators and sometimes mentors to help contestants develop their skills further or perhaps decide their future position in the competition. &quot;Popstars&quot;, which debuted in 1999, may have been the first such show, while the &quot;Idol&quot; series has been the longest-running and, for most of its run, the most popular such franchise. The first job-search show which showed dramatic, unscripted situations may have been &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, which premiered in May 2003. Other examples include &quot;The Apprentice&quot; (which judges business skills); &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, &quot;MasterChef&quot; and &quot;Top Chef&quot; (for chefs), &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; (for bakers), &quot;Shear Genius&quot; (for hair styling), &quot;Project Runway&quot; (for clothing design), &quot;Top Design&quot; and &quot;The Great Interior Design Challenge&quot; (for interior design), &quot;American Dream Builders&quot; (for home builders), &quot;Stylista&quot; (for fashion editors), &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; (for comedians), &quot;I Know My Kid&#x27;s a Star&quot; (for child performers), &quot;On the Lot&quot; (for filmmakers), &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; (for drag queens), &quot;The Shot&quot; (for fashion photographers), &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; (for dancers), &quot;MuchMusic VJ Search&quot; and &quot;Food Network Star&quot; (for television hosts), &quot;Dream Job&quot; (for sportscasters), &quot;American Candidate&quot; (for aspiring politicians), &quot;Work of Art&quot; (for artists), &quot;Face Off&quot; (for prosthetic makeup artists), &quot;Ink Master&quot; and &quot;Best Ink&quot; (for tattoo artists), &quot;Platinum Hit&quot; (for songwriters), &quot;Top Shot&quot; (for marksmen) and &quot;The Tester&quot; (for game testers).

One notable subset, popular from approximately 2005 to 2012, consisted of shows in which the winner gets a specific part in a known film, television show, musical or performing group. Examples include &quot;Scream Queens&quot; (where the prize was a role in the &quot;Saw&quot; film series), &quot;The Glee Project&quot; (for a role on the television show &quot;Glee&quot;) and &quot;How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?&quot; (the lead role in a revival of the musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;). The most extreme prize for such a show may have been for one of the first such shows, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Rock Star: INXS&quot;, where the winner became the lead singer of the rock band INXS. J.D. Fortune, who won the show, went on to be INXS&#x27;s lead singer until 2011.

Some shows use the same format with celebrities: in this case, there is no expectation that the winner will continue this line of work, and prize winnings often go to charity. The most popular such shows have been the &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; franchises. Other examples of celebrity competition programs include &quot;Deadline&quot;, &quot;Celebracadabra&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;.

==== Different contestants per episode ====
Some job-related competition shows have a different set of contestants competing on every episode, and thus more closely resemble game shows, although the &quot;confessional&quot; commentary provided by contestants gives them a reality TV aspect. The 1993-1999 Japanese cooking competition &quot;Iron Chef&quot; could be considered an early example, although it does not include commentary by the participants, only by announcers and judges. Cooking competition shows with different contestants per episode that are considered reality shows include the &quot;Chopped&quot;, &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; and &quot;Nailed It!&quot; franchises, along with &quot;Cupcake Wars&quot;, &quot;Cutthroat Kitchen&quot;, and &quot;Guy&#x27;s Grocery Games&quot;.

Non-cooking competition shows with a similar format include &quot;Forged in Fire&quot; and &quot;The Butcher&quot;.

==== Immunity ====
One concept pioneered by, and unique to, reality competition shows is the idea of immunity, in which a contestant can win the right to be exempt the next time contestants are eliminated from the show. Possibly the first instance of immunity in reality TV was on &quot;Survivor&quot;, which premiered in 1997 in Sweden as &quot;Expedition Robinson&quot;, before gaining international prominence after the American edition (titled &quot;Survivor&quot;) premiered in 2000. On that show, there are complex rules around immunity: a player can achieve it by winning challenges (either as a team in the tribal phase or individually in the merged phase), or, in more recent seasons, through finding a hidden totem. They can also pass on their immunity to someone else and in the latter case, they can keep their immunity secret from other players. 
On most shows, immunity is quite a bit simpler: it is usually achieved by winning a task, often a relatively minor task during the first half of the episode; the announcement of immunity is made publicly and immunity is usually non-transferable. At some point in the season, immunity ceases to be available, and all contestants are susceptible to elimination. Competition shows that have featured immunity include the &quot;Apprentice&quot;, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;Biggest Loser&quot;, &quot;Top Model&quot;, &quot;Project Runway&quot;, &quot;Lego Masters&quot;, and &quot;Top Chef&quot; franchises. Immunity may come with additional power as well, such as in the American version of &quot;Big Brother&quot; where the winning contestant usually has influence over deciding who faces an elimination vote later in the week. In one &quot;Apprentice&quot; episode, a participant chose to waive his earned immunity and was immediately &quot;fired&quot; for giving up this &quot;powerful asset&quot;.

=== Sports ===
Sport-related reality shows can fall within the aforementioned sub-genres, either using it as the basis of competition, or by following sport as a profession:

* Competition-based programs, featuring groups of athletes competing against each other in challenges and events within a specific sport, such as athletics (&quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot;, &quot;Exatlon&quot;), golf (&quot;The Big Break&quot;), auto racing (&quot;Crash Course&quot;, &quot;Hyperdrive&quot;, &quot;Pinks&quot;), and combat sports (&quot;The Contender&quot;, &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;) for example. In the case of combat sports examples, the UFC-produced mixed martial arts competition series &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;, and the WWE&#x27;s professional wrestling talent searches &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, &quot;Diva Search&quot;, and &quot;NXT&quot; (before it was reformatted as a traditional wrestling show with developmental talent), a contract with the respective organization was the grand prize.
** Some series may follow non-sportspeople (usually celebrities, or in some cases athletes known for their participation in a different sport) training and participating in a sporting event, such as &quot;The Games&quot;, Irish series &quot;Celebrity Bainisteoir&quot; (where celebrities are tasked to become the managers of mid-level Gaelic football teams), and &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; (a figure skating competition series with similarities to &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;).
* Documentary-style series following specific competitions, teams, or athletes, such as &quot;Hard Knocks&quot; (NFL), &quot;Drive to Survive&quot; (Formula One), &quot;Knight School&quot; (which followed students at Texas Tech University vying for a walk-on roster position on the school&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team under coach Bob Knight) and &quot;All or Nothing&quot;.
* Docusoaps following the lives of athletes and/or their families, such as &quot;Total Divas&quot; (women in WWE) and &quot;WAGS&quot; (wives and girlfriends of sportspeople).

=== Parodies and hoaxes ===
Some reality shows aim to satirize and deconstruct the conventions and cliches of the genre for comedic effect; in such cases, a fictitious premise is usually presented to one or more of the participants, with the rest of the cast consisting of actors and other figures that are in on the joke.

* &quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot;, a series in which a civilian is set up as a contestant on a fictitious reality competition, with the remaining &quot;contestants&quot; representing stereotypical archetypes of reality television contestants. The first season portrayed a &quot;Big Brother&quot;-like show entitled &quot;Lap of Luxury&quot;, with subsequent seasons parodying dating shows (&quot;Last Chance for Love&quot;, which featured both a man and woman as the targets) and bounty hunting (&quot;Full Bounty&quot;; its broadcaster Spike concealed the third season by announcing in 2012 that it had ordered &quot;Full Bounty&quot; to series as part of a larger slate of reality shows targeting male viewers, without immediately revealing it was actually a &quot;Joe Schmo Show&quot; revival).
* &quot;My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss&quot;, a parody of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; in which the contestants were given challenges with inane objectives by businessman Mr. N. Paul Todd (an anagram of &quot;Apprentice&quot; host Donald Trump). The final decision on eliminations in each episode was always given to Todd&#x27;s &quot;real boss&quot;—revealed in the series finale to have been a chimpanzee spinning a wheel.
* &quot;Superstar USA&quot;, a parody of &quot;American Idol&quot; attempting to find the worst singer. The judges criticized good singers and eliminated them, but bad singers were praised and allowed to progress further through the competition.
* &quot;Space Cadets&quot;, a series in which a group of contestants were set up on the purported reality competition series &quot;Thrill Seekers&quot;, where they would allegedly receive astronaut training in Russia and compete to become Britain&#x27;s first space tourists.
* &quot;I Wanna Marry &quot;Harry&quot;&quot;, a hoax dating competition where single women were manipulated into believing they were competing for the affection of Prince Harry, but in reality &quot;Harry&quot; was actually a lookalike.
* &quot;Nathan for You&quot;, a reality mockumentary in which Nathan Fielder attempts to help struggling businesses, but employs unusual and outlandish strategies to do so—such as rebranding a coffee shop as a &quot;parody&quot; of the Starbucks chain in which everything is appended with the word &quot;dumb&quot;, and trying to make the lifting of boxes into an exercise fad, so the owner of a moving company can receive free labor under the guise of marketing himself as a personal trainer. Although aware they are on a reality program, the employees of the businesses featured were unaware of the show&#x27;s comedic nature, and reacted genuinely to Fielder&#x27;s antics. On multiple occasions, the show received media attention related to its stunts prior to broadcast.
* The Dutch reality show &quot;De Grote Donorshow&quot;—where a group of patients competed to receive a kidney donation from a terminally-ill woman—was, by contrast, not intended for comedic effect, and was a hoax directed at viewers to help raise awareness for kidney donation.
* &quot;Jury Duty&quot;, a mockumentary series portraying a fictional jury trial in which one member of the jury is not aware that the entire trial and its events are planned and acted out.

== Criticism and analysis ==
=== &quot;Reality&quot; as misnomer ===
The authenticity of reality television is often called into question by its detractors. The genre&#x27;s title of &quot;reality&quot; is often criticized as being inaccurate because of claims that the genre frequently includes elements such as premeditated scripting (including a practice called &quot;soft-scripting&quot;), acting, urgings from behind-the-scenes crew to create specified situations of adversity and drama, and misleading editing. It has often been described as &quot;scripting without paper&quot;.

In many cases, the entire premise of the show is contrived, based around a competition or another unusual situation. Some shows have been accused of using fakery in order to create more compelling television, such as having premeditated storylines and in some cases feeding participants lines of dialogue, focusing only on participants&#x27; most outlandish behavior, and altering events through editing and re-shoots.

Shows such as &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Amazing Race&quot; that offer a monetary prize are regulated in the United States by federal &quot;game show&quot; law, , and are monitored during the filming by the legal staff and standards and practice staff of the parent network. These shows cannot be manipulated in any way that affects the outcome of the game. However, misleading editing does not fall into altering the fairness of the competition.

Reality television shows that have been accused of, or admitted to, deception include &quot;The Real World&quot;, the American version of &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot;, &quot;The Hills&quot;, &quot;A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila&quot;, &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot;, &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;, &quot;The Bachelor&quot; and &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;, &quot;Pawn Stars&quot;, &quot;Storage Wars&quot;, &quot;Squid Game: The Challenge&quot; and &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot;.

In contrast, critic Matt Zoller Seitz praised &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot; as having &quot;brought old-school documentary sobriety to a genre more often known for shamelessness.&quot;

=== Political and cultural impact ===
Reality television&#x27;s global success has become, in the view of some analysts, an important political phenomenon. In some authoritarian countries, reality-television voting has provided the first opportunity for many citizens to vote in any free and fair wide-scale &quot;elections&quot;. In addition, the frankness of the settings on some reality shows presents situations that are often taboo in certain conservative cultures, like &quot;Star Academy Arab World&quot;, which began airing in 2003, and which shows male and female contestants living together. A Pan-Arab version of &quot;Big Brother&quot; was cancelled in 2004 after less than two weeks on the air after a public outcry and street protests. In 2004 journalist Matt Labash, noting both of these issues, wrote that &quot;the best hope of little Americas developing in the Middle East could be Arab-produced reality TV&quot;.

In 2007, Abu Dhabi TV began airing &quot;Million&#x27;s Poet&quot;, a show featuring &quot;Pop Idol&quot;-style voting and elimination, but for the writing and oration of Arabic poetry. The show became popular in Arab countries, with around 18 million viewers, partly because it was able to combine the excitement of reality television with a traditional, culturally relevant topic. In April 2010, however, the show also became a subject of political controversy, when Hissa Hilal, a 43-year-old female Saudi competitor, read out a poem criticizing her country&#x27;s Muslim clerics. Both critics and the public reacted favorably to Hilal&#x27;s poetry; she received the highest scores from the judges throughout the competition and came in third place overall.

In India, in the summer of 2007, coverage of the third season of &quot;Indian Idol&quot; focused on the breaking down of cultural and socioeconomic barriers as the public rallied around the show&#x27;s top two contestants.

The Chinese singing competition &quot;Super Girl&quot; (a local imitation of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;) has similarly been cited for its political and cultural impact. After the finale of the show&#x27;s 2005 season drew an audience of around 400 million people, and eight million text-message votes, the state-run English-language newspaper &quot;Beijing Today&quot; ran the front-page headline: &quot;Is Super Girl a Force for Democracy?&quot; The Chinese government criticized the show, citing both its democratic nature and its excessive vulgarity, or &quot;worldliness&quot;, and in 2006 banned it outright. It was later reintroduced in 2009, before being banned again in 2011. &quot;Super Girl&quot; has also been criticized by non-government commentators for creating seemingly impossible ideals that may be harmful to Chinese youth.

In Indonesia, reality television shows have surpassed soap operas as the most-watched broadcast programs. One popular program, &quot;Jika Aku Menjadi&quot; (&quot;If I Were&quot;), follows young, middle-class people as they are temporarily placed into lower-class life, where they learn to appreciate their circumstances back home by experiencing daily life for the less fortunate. Critics have claimed that this and similar programs in Indonesia reinforce traditionally Western ideals of materialism and consumerism. However, Eko Nugroho, reality-show producer and president of Dreamlight World Media, insists that these reality shows are not promoting American lifestyles but rather reaching people through their universal desires.

Reality television has also received criticism in Britain and the United States for its ideological relationship with surveillance societies and consumerism. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2012, author Mark Andrejevic characterised the role of reality television in a post-9/11 society as the normalisation of surveillance in participatory monitoring, the &quot;logic of the emerging surveillance economy&quot;, and in the promise of a societal self-image that is contrived. An LSE paper by Nick Couldry associates reality television with neoliberalism, condemning the ritualised enactment and consumption of what must be legitimised for the society it serves.

=== As a substitute for scripted drama ===
Reality television generally costs less to produce than scripted series.

VH1 executive vice president Michael Hirschorn wrote in 2007 that the plots and subject matters on reality television are more authentic and more engaging than in scripted dramas, writing that scripted network television &quot;remains dominated by variants on the police procedural... in which a stock group of characters (ethnically, sexually, and generationally diverse) grapples with endless versions of the same dilemma. The episodes have all the ritual predictability of Japanese Noh theater,&quot; while reality television is &quot;the liveliest genre on the set right now. It has engaged hot-button cultural issues – class, sex, race – that respectable television... rarely touches.&quot;

Television critic James Poniewozik wrote in 2008 that reality shows like &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot; and &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot; showcase working-class people of the kind that &quot;used to be routine&quot; on scripted network television, but that became a rarity in the 2000s: &quot;The better to woo upscale viewers, TV has evicted its mechanics and dockworkers to collect higher rents from yuppies in coffeehouses.&quot;

In a 2021 interview, filmmaker Mike White (who had previously competed on &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot;) said that reality competition shows like &quot;Survivor&quot; accurately conveyed how, in real life, &quot;so much of self is situational&quot;, so that, as circumstances change, &quot;the oppressed becomes the oppressor, the bully becomes the bullied.&quot; In contrast, he felt that in scripted drama &quot;there&#x27;s a lot of religiosity around humanity.&quot;

=== Instant celebrity ===

Reality television has the potential to turn its participants into national celebrities, at least for a short period. This is most notable in talent-search programs such as &quot;Idol&quot; and &quot;The X Factor&quot;, which have spawned music stars in many of the countries in which they have aired. Many other shows, however, have made mostly temporary celebrities out of their participants; some participants have then been able to parlay this fame into media and merchandising careers. Participants of non-talent-search programs who have had subsequent acting careers include Lilian Afegbai, Jacinda Barrett, Jamie Chung, Stephen Colletti, David Giuntoli, Vishal Karwal, NeNe Leakes and Angela Trimbur; though Barrett and Trimbur were already aspiring actresses when they appeared on reality television. Reality TV participants who have become television hosts and personalities include Nabilla Benattia, Rachel Campos-Duffy, Kristin Cavallari, Colby Donaldson, Raffaella Fico, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Katie Hopkins, Rebecca Jarvis, Jodie Marsh, Heidi Montag, Tiffany Pollard and Whitney Port; some of them have had acting careers as well. Reality TV participants who have become television personalities as well as successful entrepreneurs include Gemma Collins, Lauren Conrad, Jade Goody, Bethenny Frankel and Spencer Matthews. Several cast members of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; have had lucrative endorsement deals, and in some cases their own product lines. Wrestlers Mike &quot;The Miz&quot; Mizanin and David Otunga got their start on non-athletic reality shows.

In Australia, various reality TV personalities have later served as radio hosts, including Fitzy and Rachel Corbett from &quot;Big Brother&quot;, Mick Newell from &quot;My Kitchen Rules&quot;, Heather Maltman from &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, and Sam Frost from &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;.

Some reality-television alumni have parlayed their fame into paid public appearances.

Several socialites, or children of famous parents, who were somewhat well known before they appeared on reality television shows have become much more famous as a result, including Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Kelly Osbourne, Kim Kardashian, and many of the rest of the Kardashian family.

Reality television personalities often get derided as &quot;Z-list celebrities&quot;. Some have been lampooned for exploiting an undeserved &quot;15 minutes of fame&quot;. The Kardashian family is one such group of reality television personalities who were subject to this criticism in the 2010s, Kim Kardashian in particular.

=== Springboard for political success ===
Two international franchises, &quot;The Apprentice&quot; and &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot;, are notable for having some of the business people who appeared there as judges and investors go on to win political office. The prime example is President of the United States Donald Trump: his stint as host of the original &quot;The Apprentice&quot; from 2004 to 2015 has been credited by some commentators as a factor in his political success, since it greatly increased his fame, and showcased him as a tough and experienced authority figure. Lado Gurgenidze, who hosted the Georgian version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; in 2005, was appointed Prime Minister of Georgia from 2007, and served until 2008. Harry Harkimo, who hosted the Finnish version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; from 2009 to 2013, has been a member of the Parliament of Finland since 2015. João Doria, who hosted seasons 7-8 of the Brazilian version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, &quot;O Aprendiz&quot;, from 2010 to 2011, served as Mayor of São Paulo from 2017 to 2018, and as Governor of São Paulo from 2018 to 2022. Bruno Bonnell, who hosted the short-lived French version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; in 2015, was a member of France&#x27;s National Assembly from 2017 to 2022.

&quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot; investors who have gone on to hold political office after appearing on their country&#x27;s version of the program include Tommy Ahlers of Denmark, Nir Barkat of Israel, Anne Berner of Finland, Tomio Okamura of the Czech Republic, and Lencke Wischhusen of Germany.

In a rare case of a previously unknown reality television alumnus succeeding in the political arena, &quot;The Real World: Boston&quot; cast member Sean Duffy was a U.S. Representative from Wisconsin from 2010 to 2019.

=== Youth audience ===
In 2006, four of the ten most popular programs among viewers under 17 were reality shows. Studies have shown that young people emulate the behavior displayed on these programs, gathering much of their knowledge of the social world, particularly about consumer practices, from television. Some critics have decried the positive representation of sexually objectified women in shows like &quot;The Girls Next Door&quot;.

In 2007, according to the Learning and Skills Council, one in seven UK teenagers hoped to gain fame by appearing on reality television.

=== Appeal ===
A number of studies have tried to pinpoint the appeal of reality television. Factors that have been cited in its appeal include personal identification with the onscreen participants; pure entertainment; diversion from scripted TV; vicarious participation; a feeling of self-importance compared to onscreen participants; enjoyment of competition; and an appeal to voyeurism, especially given &quot;scenes which take place in private settings, contain nudity, or include gossip&quot;.

A 2012 survey by Today.com found that Americans who watch reality television regularly are more extroverted, more neurotic, and have lower self-esteem than those who do not.

== Similar works in popular culture ==
A number of fictional works since the 1940s have contained elements similar to elements of reality television. They tended to be set in a dystopian future, with subjects being recorded against their will and often involved violence.

* &quot;The Seventh Victim&quot; (1953) is a short story by science fiction author Robert Sheckley that depicted a futuristic game in which one player gets to hunt down another player and kill him. The first player who can score ten kills wins the grand prize. This story was the basis for the Italian film &quot;The 10th Victim&quot; (1965).
* &quot;You&#x27;re Another&quot;, a 1955 short story by Damon Knight, is about a man who discovers that he is an actor in a &quot;livie&quot;, a live-action show that is viewed by billions of people in the future.
* &quot;A King in New York&quot;, a 1957 film written and directed by Charlie Chaplin has the main character, a fictional European monarch portrayed by Chaplin, secretly filmed while talking to people at a New York cocktail party. The footage is later turned into a television show within the film.
* &quot;The Prize of Peril&quot; (1958), another Robert Sheckley story, is about a television show in which a contestant volunteers to be hunted for a week by trained killers, with a large cash prize if he survives. It was adapted in 1970 as the TV movie &quot;Das Millionenspiel&quot;, and again in 1983 as the movie &quot;Le Prix du Danger&quot;.
* Richard G. Stern&#x27;s novel &quot;Golk&quot; (1960) is about a hidden-camera show similar to &quot;Candid Camera&quot;.
* &quot;It Could Be You&quot; (1964), a short story by Australian Frank Roberts, features a day-in-day-out televised blood sport.
* &quot;Survivor&quot; (1965), a science fiction novelette by Walter F. Moudy, depicted the 2050 &quot;Olympic War Games&quot; between Russia and the United States. The games are fought to show the world the futility of war and thus deter further conflict. Each side has one hundred soldiers who fight in a large natural arena. The goal is for one side to wipe out the other; the few who survive the battle become heroes. The games are televised, complete with color commentary discussing tactics, soldiers&#x27; personal backgrounds, and slow-motion replays of their deaths.
* &quot;Bread and Circuses&quot; (1968) is an episode of the science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot; in which the crew visits a planet resembling the Roman Empire, but with 20th-century technology. The planet&#x27;s &quot;Empire TV&quot; features regular gladiatorial games, with the announcer urging viewers at home to vote for their favorites, stating, &quot;This is your program. You pick the winner.&quot;
* &quot;The Year of the Sex Olympics&quot; (1968) is a BBC television play in which a dissident in a dictatorship is forced onto a secluded island and taped for a reality show in order to keep the masses entertained.
* &quot;The Unsleeping Eye&quot; (1973), a novel by D.G. Compton (also published as &quot;The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe&quot;), is about a woman dying of cancer whose last days are recorded without her knowledge for a television show. It was later adapted as the 1980 movie &quot;Death Watch&quot;.
* &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, This Is Your Crisis&quot; (1976) is a short story by science fiction author Kate Wilhelm about a television show in which contestants (including a B-list actress who is hoping to revitalize her career) attempt to make their way to a checkpoint after being dropped off in the Alaskan wilderness, while being filmed and broadcast around the clock through an entire weekend. The story focuses primarily on the show&#x27;s effect on a couple whose domestic tensions and eventual reconciliation parallel the dangers faced by the contestants.
* The film &quot;Network&quot; (1976) includes a subplot in which network executives negotiate with an urban terrorist group for the production of a weekly series, each episode of which was to feature an act of terrorism. The climax of the film has the terrorist group being turned against the network&#x27;s own unstable star, news commentator Howard Beale.
* &quot;The Running Man&quot; (1982) is a book by Stephen King depicting a game show in which a contestant flees around the world from &quot;hunters&quot; trying to chase him down and kill him; it has been speculated that the book was inspired by &quot;The Prize of Peril&quot;. The book was loosely adapted as a 1987 movie of the same name. The movie removed most of the reality-TV element of the book: its competition now took place entirely within a large television studio, and more closely resembled an athletic competition (though a deadly one).
* The film &quot;20 Minutes into the Future&quot; (1985), and the spin-off television series &quot;Max Headroom&quot;, revolved around television mainly based on live, often candid, broadcasts. In one episode of &quot;Max Headroom&quot;, &quot;Academy&quot;, the character Blank Reg fights for his life on a courtroom game show, with the audience deciding his fate.
* &quot;Vengeance on Varos&quot; (1985) is a serial of the television show &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in which the population of a planet watches live television broadcasts of the torture and executions of those who oppose the government. The planet&#x27;s political system is based on the leaders themselves facing disintegration if the population votes &#x27;no&#x27; to their propositions.

== Pop culture references ==

* &quot;L.A. Candy&quot; (2009) is a young adult novel series by Lauren Conrad, which is based on her experiences on &quot;Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County&quot; and &quot;The Hills&quot;.

== Other influences on popular culture ==
A number of scripted television comedy and satire shows have adopted the format of the documentary-type reality television show, in &quot;mockumentary&quot; style. The first such show was the BBC series &quot;Operation Good Guys&quot;, which premiered in 1997. Arguably the best-known and most influential such show is the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Office&quot; (2001), which spawned numerous international remakes, including a successful American version. Other examples include &quot;People Like Us&quot; (BBC UK, 1998), &quot;The Games&quot; (ABC Australia, 1999), &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; (2001), &quot;Reno 911!&quot; (2003), &quot;The Naked Brothers Band&quot; (2006), &quot;Summer Heights High&quot; (2007), &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (2009), &quot;Modern Family&quot; (2009), &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot; (2010), &quot;Real Husbands of Hollywood&quot; (2013), &quot;Trial &amp; Error&quot; (2017), &quot;Cut&quot; (2017) and &quot;Abbott Elementary&quot; (2021). The genre has even encompassed cartoons (&quot;Drawn Together&quot; (2004) and &quot;Total Drama&quot; (2007)) and a show about puppets (&quot;The Muppets&quot;, 2015).

Not all reality-television-style mockumentary series are comedic: the 2013 American series &quot;Siberia&quot; has a science fiction-horror bent, while the 2014 Dutch series &quot;The First Years&quot; is a drama.

The 2013–2015 American sketch comedy series &quot;Kroll Show&quot; set most of its sketches as excerpts from various fictional reality television shows, which one critic wrote &quot;aren&#x27;t far off from the lineups at E!, Bravo, and VH1&quot;, and parodied those shows&#x27; participants&#x27; &quot;lack of self-awareness&quot;. The show also satirized the often incestuous nature of reality television, in which some series lead to a cascade of spinoffs. &quot;Kroll Show&quot; executive producer John Levenstein said in an interview that reality TV &quot;has so many tools for telling stories in terms of text and flashbacks and ways to show things to the audience that it&#x27;s incredibly convenient for comedy and storytelling if you use the full reality show toolkit.&quot;

Some feature films have been produced that use some of the conventions of reality television; such films are sometimes referred to as reality films, and sometimes simply as documentaries. Allen Funt&#x27;s 1970 hidden camera movie &quot;What Do You Say to a Naked Lady?&quot; was based on his reality-television show &quot;Candid Camera&quot;. The series &quot;Jackass&quot; spawned five feature films, starting with &quot;&quot; in 2002. A similar Finnish show, &quot;The Dudesons&quot;, was adapted for the film &quot;The Dudesons Movie&quot;, and a similar British show, &quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot;, was adapted for &quot;Dirty Sanchez: The Movie&quot;, both in 2006. The producers of &quot;The Real World&quot; created &quot;The Real Cancun&quot; in 2003. The Chinese reality show &quot;Keep Running&quot; was adapted for the 2015 film &quot;Running Man&quot;.

The 2003 BBC film &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; incorporated reality TV-style confessionals in which the two main characters talked directly to the camera.

In 2007, broadcaster Krishnan Guru-Murthy stated that reality television is &quot;a firm and embedded part of television&#x27;s vocabulary, used in every genre from game-shows and drama to news and current affairs.&quot;

The mumblecore film genre, which began in the mid-2000s, and uses video cameras and relies heavily on improvisation and non-professional actors, has been described as influenced in part by what one critic called &quot;the spring-break psychodrama of MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Real World&quot;. Mumblecore director Joe Swanberg has said, &quot;As annoying as reality TV is, it&#x27;s been really good for filmmakers because it got mainstream audiences used to watching shaky camerawork and different kinds of situations.&quot;

<doc id="38542" wikidata="Q189434" url="?curid=38542" title="Multiplexer">
<text>In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux; spelled sometimes as multiplexor), also known as a data selector, is a device that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. The selection is directed by a separate set of digital inputs known as select lines. A multiplexer of formula_1 inputs has formula_2 select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output.

A multiplexer makes it possible for several input signals to share one device or resource, for example, one analog-to-digital converter or one communications transmission medium, instead of having one device per input signal. Multiplexers can also be used to implement Boolean functions of multiple variables.

Conversely, a demultiplexer (or demux) is a device that takes a single input signal and selectively forwards it to one of several output lines. A multiplexer is often used with a complementary demultiplexer on the receiving end.

An electronic multiplexer can be considered as a multiple-input, single-output switch, and a demultiplexer as a single-input, multiple-output switch. The schematic symbol for a multiplexer is an isosceles trapezoid with the longer parallel side containing the input pins and the short parallel side containing the output pin. The schematic on the right shows a 2-to-1 multiplexer on the left and an equivalent switch on the right. The formula_3 wire connects the desired input to the output.

==Applications==

Multiplexers are part of computer systems to select data from a specific source, be it a memory chip or a hardware peripheral. A computer uses multiplexers to control the data and address buses, allowing the processor to select data from multiple data sources.

In digital communications, multiplexers allow several connections over a single channel, by connecting the multiplexer&#x27;s single output to the demultiplexer&#x27;s single input (Time-Division Multiplexing). The image to the right demonstrates this benefit. In this case, the cost of implementing separate channels for each data source is higher than the cost and inconvenience of providing the multiplexing/demultiplexing functions.

At the receiving end of the data link a complementary &quot;demultiplexer&quot; is usually required to break the single data stream back down into the original streams. In some cases, the far end system may have functionality greater than a simple demultiplexer; and while the demultiplexing still occurs technically, it may never be implemented discretely. This would be the case when, for instance, a multiplexer serves a number of IP network users; and then feeds directly into a router, which immediately reads the content of the entire link into its routing processor; and then does the demultiplexing in memory from where it will be converted directly into IP sections.

Often, a multiplexer and demultiplexer are combined into a single piece of equipment, which is simply referred to as a &quot;multiplexer&quot;. Both circuit elements are needed at both ends of a transmission link because most communications systems transmit in both directions.

In analog circuit design, a multiplexer is a special type of analog switch that connects one signal selected from several inputs to a single output.

==Digital multiplexers==
In digital circuit design, the selector wires are of digital value. In the case of a 2-to-1 multiplexer, a logic value of 0 would connect formula_4 to the output while a logic value of 1 would connect formula_5 to the output.
In larger multiplexers, the number of selector pins is equal to formula_6 where formula_7 is the number of inputs.

For example, 9 to 16 inputs would require no fewer than 4 selector pins and 17 to 32 inputs would require no fewer than 5 selector pins. The binary value expressed on these selector pins determines the selected input pin.

A 2-to-1 multiplexer has a Boolean equation where formula_8 and formula_9 are the two inputs, formula_10 is the selector input, and formula_11 is the output:
: formula_12 or
: formula_13
Which can be expressed as a truth table:

Or, in simpler notation:


These tables show that when formula_14 then formula_15 but when formula_16 then formula_17. A straightforward realization of this 2-to-1 multiplexer would need 2 AND gates, an OR gate, and a NOT gate. While this is mathematically correct, a direct physical implementation would be prone to race conditions that require additional gates to suppress.

Larger multiplexers are also common and, as stated above, require formula_6 selector pins for formula_2 inputs. Other common sizes are 4-to-1, 8-to-1, and 16-to-1. Since digital logic uses binary values, powers of 2 are used (4, 8, 16) to maximally control a number of inputs for the given number of selector inputs.

The Boolean equation for a 4-to-1 multiplexer is:
:formula_20 or
:formula_21

Which can be expressed as a truth table:

The following 4-to-1 multiplexer is constructed from 3-state buffers and AND gates (the AND gates are acting as the decoder):

The subscripts on the formula_22 inputs indicate the decimal value of the binary control inputs at which that input is let through.

===Chaining multiplexers and mux trees===
Larger Multiplexers can be constructed by using smaller multiplexers by chaining them together in what are called &quot;mux trees&quot;. For example, an 8:1 multiplexer can be made with two 4:1 and one 2:1 multiplexers. The two 4:1 multiplexer outputs are fed into the 2:1 with the selector pins on the 4:1&#x27;s put in parallel giving a total number of selector inputs to 3, which is equivalent to an 8:1.

===List of ICs which provide multiplexing===

For 7400 series part numbers in the following table, &quot;x&quot; is the logic family.
==Digital demultiplexers==

Demultiplexers take one data input and a number of selection inputs, and they have several outputs.
They forward the data input to one of the outputs depending on the values of the selection inputs.
Demultiplexers are sometimes convenient for designing general-purpose logic because if the demultiplexer&#x27;s input is always true, the demultiplexer acts as a binary decoder.
This means that any function of the selection bits can be constructed by logically OR-ing the correct set of outputs.

If X is the input and S is the selector, and A and B are the outputs:

formula_23
formula_24


===List of ICs which provide demultiplexing===

For 7400 series part numbers in the following table, &quot;x&quot; is the logic family.
== Bi-directional multiplexers ==
Bi-directional multiplexers are built using analog switches or transmission gates controlled by the select pins. This allows the roles of input and output to be swapped so that a bi-directional multiplexer can function both as a demultiplexer and multiplexer.

==Multiplexers as PLDs==
Multiplexers can also be used as programmable logic devices, to implement Boolean functions. Any Boolean function of &quot;n&quot; variables and one result can be implemented with a multiplexer with &quot;n&quot; selector inputs. The variables are connected to the selector inputs, and the function result, 0 or 1, for each possible combination of selector inputs is connected to the corresponding data input. If one of the variables (for example, &quot;D&quot;) is also available inverted, a multiplexer with &quot;n&quot;-1 selector inputs is sufficient; the data inputs are connected to 0, 1, &quot;D&quot;, or ~&quot;D&quot;, according to the desired output for each combination of the selector inputs.

== Unconventional use of multiplexers for arithmetic ==
Multiplexers have found application in unconventional stochastic computing (SC), particularly in facilitating arithmetic addition. In this paradigm, data is represented as a probability bitstream where the number of &#x27;1&#x27; bits signifies the magnitude of a value. Thus, the function of a 2-to-1 multiplexer can be conceptualized as a probability function denoted as:

formula_25

, where a and b are the input bitstream and s is the select input. Using the select input = 0.5 yields:

formula_26

While this approach doesn&#x27;t yield exact addition but rather scaled addition, it is deemed acceptable in most SC studies. Multiplexers are extensively utilized for tasks such as average addition, average pooling, and median filtering within SC circuits. Moreover, more sophisticated applications of multiplexers include serving as Bernstein polynomial function generator, capable of producing arbitrary mathematical functions within the SC domain. Recent research has also revealed that combinations of multiplexers can facilitate large-scale multiply-accumulate operation, demonstrating feasibility in accelerating convolutional neural network on field-programmable gate arrays.

<doc id="38543" wikidata="Q7755107" url="?curid=38543" title="The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas">
<text>&quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas&quot; () is a 1973 short work of philosophical fiction by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin. With deliberately both vague and vivid descriptions, the narrator depicts a summer festival in the utopian city of Omelas, whose prosperity depends on the perpetual misery of a single child. &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas&quot; was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Short Fiction in 1974 and won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1974.

==Plot==
The only chronological element of the work is that it begins by describing the first day of summer in Omelas, a shimmering city of unbelievable happiness and delight. In Omelas, the summer solstice is celebrated with a glorious festival and a race featuring young people on horseback. The vibrant festival atmosphere, however, seems to be an everyday characteristic of the blissful community, whose citizens, though limited in their technology and resources, are still intelligent, sophisticated, and cultured. Omelas has no kings, soldiers, priests, or slaves. The specific socio-politico-economic setup of the community is not mentioned; the narrator merely claims not to be sure of every particular.

The narrator reflects that, &quot;Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, long ago and far away, once upon a time. Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids, assuming it will rise to the occasion, for certainly I cannot suit you all.&quot; Everything about Omelas is so abundantly pleasing that the narrator decides the reader is not truly convinced of its existence and so elaborates upon the final element of the city: its one atrocity. The city&#x27;s constant state of serenity and splendor requires that a single unfortunate child be kept in perpetual filth, darkness, and misery.

Once citizens are old enough to know the truth, most, though initially shocked and disgusted, ultimately acquiesce to this one injustice that secures the happiness of the rest of the city. However, some citizens, young and old, walk away from the city after seeing the child. Each is alone, and no one knows where they go, but none come back. The story ends by stating, &quot;The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.&quot;

==Inspiration and themes==
Le Guin’s short story explores the ideas of utilitarianism. Le Guin stated that the city&#x27;s name is pronounced &quot;OH-meh-lahss&quot;. Le Guin hit upon the name of the town on seeing a road sign for Salem, Oregon, in a car mirror. &quot;[… People ask me] &#x27;Where &quot;do&quot; you get your ideas from, Ms. Le Guin?&#x27; From forgetting Dostoyevsky and reading road signs backwards, naturally. Where else?&quot;

&quot;The central idea of this psychomyth, the scapegoat&quot;, writes Le Guin, &quot;turns up in Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot;, and several people have asked me, rather suspiciously, why I gave the credit to William James. The fact is, I haven&#x27;t been able to re-read Dostoyevsky, much as I loved him, since I was twenty-five, and I&#x27;d simply forgotten he used the idea. But when I met it in James&#x27; &#x27;The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life&#x27;, it was with a shock of recognition.&quot;

The quote from William James is:

As for the original Dostoyevsky quote, Charlie Jane Anders of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; notes:

In &quot;Karamazov&quot;, Dovstoevsky poses the problem of the Tortured Child:

&quot;Tell me yourself — I challenge you: let’s assume that you were called upon to build the edifice of human destiny so that men would finally be happy and would find peace and tranquility. If you knew that, in order to attain this, you would have to torture just one single creature, let’s say the little girl who beat her chest so desperately in the outhouse, and that on her unavenged tears you could build that edifice, would you agree to do it? Tell me and don’t lie!&quot;

&quot;No I would not,&quot; Alyosha said softly.

 refers to the doctrine of salvation through the crucifixion of Jesus.

== Publication history ==
Le Guin&#x27;s piece was originally published in &quot;New Dimensions 3&quot;, a hardcover science fiction anthology edited by Robert Silverberg, in October 1973. It was reprinted in Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Wind&#x27;s Twelve Quarters&quot; in 1975, and has been frequently anthologized elsewhere. It has also appeared as an independently published, 31-page hardcover book for young adults in 1993.

It was republished in the second volume of the short-story anthology &quot;The Unreal and the Real&quot; in 2012. Le Guin noted in that collection that &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas&quot; &quot;has a long and happy career of being used by teachers to upset students and make them argue fiercely about morality.&quot;

== Cultural legacy ==

&quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas&quot; inspired a variety of follow-up works and cultural references.

Designers Ricardo Bare and Harvey Smith of the &quot;Dishonored&quot; video game series drew on the story as inspiration for the supernatural being The Outsider, an omnipotent immortal reviled as an avatar of evil.

Artist Andrew DeGraff illustrated a map visualizing Le Guin&#x27;s story in 2015 book &quot;Plotted: A Literary Atlas&quot;. DeGraff wrote that: &quot;Le Guin provides us with the building blocks to construct the city of Omelas, but if we want to forsake it afterward, then we too have to strike out alone.&quot;

The 2017 music video for &quot;Spring Day&quot; by South Korean band BTS references Le Guin&#x27;s short story, both thematically and in displaying a hotel named &#x27;Omelas&#x27;.

N. K. Jemisin&#x27;s 2018 collection &quot;How Long &#x27;til Black Future Month?&quot; opens with a piece titled &quot;The Ones Who Stay and Fight&quot;, which is a direct response to Le Guin&#x27;s story. In an interview with &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, the writer stated that many readers misunderstand Le Guin as arguing that the only way to create a better society is to leave, and that in fact Le Guin was arguing that one has to &quot;fix&quot; their society, &quot;especially when there&#x27;s nowhere to walk away to.&quot; Jemisin&#x27;s 2022 novel &quot;The World We Make&quot; makes allusion to the story as well, using the descriptor &quot;Omelasian&quot; in reference to children being captive in a basement. 

Joe George argued that the 2019 film &quot;Us&quot; was influenced by both Le Guin&#x27;s short story as well as Octavia E. Butler&#x27;s &quot;Speech Sounds&quot;.

Catherine Lacey&#x27;s 2020 novel &quot;Pew&quot; begins with an epigraph from &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas&quot;, quoting the last paragraph of the story. The novel itself is heavily tied to Le Guin&#x27;s work, with several key similarities present.

Executive producers and co-showrunners Michelle Paradise and Alex Kurtzman cited Le Guin&#x27;s short story as inspiration for the plot line of the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, with Kurtzman noting that both creators were interested in the central dilemma being solely caused by a child. Several reviewers also noted a strong similarity between the story and the episode &quot;Lift Us Where Suffering Cannot Reach&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; first season&quot;.&quot; Reviewer Anthony Pascale called the episode &quot;almost a beat-for-beat recreation&quot; of Le Guin&#x27;s work. On the satirical website Cracked, JM McNab pointed out the long history of Le Guin&#x27;s influence on the Star Trek franchise and that while the writers of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; did name a ship after her, the honor is &quot;still not as good as being credited&quot;.

The 2022 fantasy novel &quot;The Golden Enclaves&quot; by Naomi Novik features a dilemma similar to the one presented in &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.&quot;
Isabel J. Kim&#x27;s short story &quot;Why Don&#x27;t We Just Kill the Kid In the Omelas Hole&quot;, published in &quot;Clarkesworld Magazine&quot; in February 2024, is set after the events of Le Guin&#x27;s story. It discusses a third option besides staying in Omelas or walking away: killing the suffering child (described by one of the murderers as a form of accelerationism).

<text>Nutmeg is the seed, or the ground spice derived from that seed, of several tree species of the genus &quot;Myristica&quot;; fragrant nutmeg or true nutmeg (&quot;M. fragrans&quot;) is a dark-leaved evergreen tree cultivated for two spices derived from its fruit: nutmeg, from its seed, and mace, from the seed covering. It is also a commercial source of nutmeg essential oil and nutmeg butter. Maluku&#x27;s Banda Islands are the main producer of nutmeg and mace, and the true nutmeg tree is native to the islands.

If consumed in amounts exceeding its typical use as a spice, nutmeg powder may produce allergic reactions, cause contact dermatitis, or have psychoactive effects. Although used in traditional medicine for treating various disorders, nutmeg has no scientifically confirmed medicinal value.

Conifers of the genus &quot;Torreya&quot;, commonly known as the nutmeg yews, have edible seeds of similar appearance, but are not closely related to &quot;M. fragrans&quot;, and are not used as a spice.

== Common nutmeg ==
Nutmeg is the spice made by grinding the seed of the fragrant nutmeg tree (&quot;Myristica fragrans&quot;) into powder. The spice has a distinctive pungent fragrance and a warm, slightly sweet taste; it is used to flavor many kinds of baked goods, confections, puddings, potatoes, meats, sausages, sauces, vegetables, and such beverages as eggnog.

The seeds are dried gradually in the sun over a period of 15 to 30 weeks. During this time, the nutmeg shrinks away from its hard seed coat until the kernels rattle in their shells when shaken. The shell is then broken with a wooden club and the nutmegs are picked out. Dried nutmegs are greenish brown ovoids with furrowed surfaces. The nutmegs are roughly egg-shaped, about long and wide, weighing dried.

Two other species of genus &quot;Myristica&quot; with different flavors, &quot;M. malabarica&quot; and &quot;M. argentea&quot;, are sometimes used to adulterate nutmeg as a spice.

=== Mace ===

Mace is the spice made from the reddish seed covering (aril) of the nutmeg seed. Its flavour is similar to that of nutmeg but more delicate; it is used to flavour baked goods, meat, fish, and vegetables, and in preserving and pickling.

In the processing of mace, the crimson-colored aril is removed from the nutmeg seed that it envelops and is flattened out and dried for 10 to 14 days. Its color changes to pale yellow, orange, or tan. Whole dry mace consists of flat pieces—smooth, horn-like, and brittle—about long.

== Botany and cultivation ==

The most important commercial species is the common, true or fragrant nutmeg, &quot;M. fragrans&quot; (Myristicaceae), native to the Moluccas (or Spice Islands) of Indonesia. It is also cultivated on Penang Island in Malaysia, in the Caribbean, especially in Grenada, and in Kerala, a state formerly known as Malabar in ancient writings as the hub of spice trading, in southern India. In the 17th-century work &quot;Hortus Botanicus Malabaricus&quot;, Hendrik van Rheede records that Indians learned the usage of nutmeg from the Indonesians through ancient trade routes.

Nutmeg trees are dioecious plants (individual plants are either male or female), which are propagated sexually from seeds and asexually from cuttings or grafting. Sexual propagation yields 50% male seedlings, which are unproductive. Because no reliable method has been found for determining plant sex before flowering in the sixth to eighth year, and sexual reproduction bears inconsistent yields, grafting is the preferred method of propagation. Epicotyl grafting (a variation of cleft grafting using seedlings), approach grafting, and patch budding have proved successful, with epicotyl grafting being the most widely adopted standard. Air layering is an alternative though not preferred method because of its low (35–40%) success rate.

The first harvest of nutmeg trees takes place 7–9 years after planting, and the trees reach full production after 20 years.

In the Banda Islands where the nutmeg is endemic, there is a symbiotic relationship between the Kenari nut tree (&quot;Canarium indicum&quot;) and the nutmeg (&quot;Myristica fragrans&quot;), the former providing the nutmeg with shade and serving as a wind-break from the strong winds.

== Uses ==
=== Spice ===
Nutmeg and mace have similar sensory qualities, with nutmeg having a slightly sweeter and mace a more delicate flavour. Mace is often preferred in light dishes for the bright orange, saffron-like hue it imparts. Nutmeg is used for flavouring many dishes. Whole nutmeg can also be ground at home using a grater specifically designed for nutmeg or a multi-purpose grating tool.

In Indonesian cuisine, nutmeg is used in dishes, such as spicy soups including variants of &quot;soto&quot;, &quot;konro&quot;, oxtail soup, &quot;sup iga&quot; (ribs soup), &quot;bakso&quot;, and &quot;sup kambing&quot;. It is also used in gravy for meat dishes, such as &quot;semur&quot;, beef stew, ribs with tomato, and European derived dishes such as &quot;bistik&quot; (beef steak), &quot;rolade&quot; (minced meat roll), and &quot;bistik lidah&quot; (beef tongue steak).

In Indian cuisine, nutmeg is used in many sweet, as well as savoury, dishes. In Kerala Malabar region, grated nutmeg is used in meat preparations and also sparingly added to desserts for the flavour. It may also be used in small quantities in &quot;garam masala&quot;.

In traditional European cuisine, nutmeg and mace are used especially in potato and spinach dishes and in processed meat products; they are also used in soups, sauces, and baked goods. It is also commonly used in rice pudding. In Dutch cuisine, nutmeg is added to vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and string beans. Nutmeg is a traditional ingredient in mulled cider, mulled wine, junket and eggnog. In Scotland, mace and nutmeg are usually both ingredients in haggis. In Italian cuisine, nutmeg is used as part of the stuffing for many regional meat-filled dumplings like tortellini, as well as for the traditional meatloaf. 
Nutmeg is a common spice for pumpkin pie and in recipes for other winter squashes, such as baked acorn squash. In the Caribbean, nutmeg is often used in drinks, such as the Bushwacker, Painkiller, and Barbados rum punch. Typically, it is a sprinkle on top of the drink.

=== Fruit ===
The pericarp (fruit covering) is used to make jam, or is finely sliced, cooked with sugar, and crystallised to make a fragrant candy. Sliced nutmeg fruit flesh is made as &quot;manisan&quot; (sweets), either wet, which is seasoned in sugary syrup liquid, or dry coated with sugar, a dessert called &quot;manisan pala&quot; in Indonesia. In Penang cuisine, dried, shredded nutmeg rind with sugar coating is used as toppings on the uniquely Penang &quot;ais kacang&quot;. The flesh of the nutmeg fruit is also blended, in the fresh state, into a type of smoothie (white in colour and having a fresh, ‘green’, tangy taste); or boiled, resulting in a brown liquid, much sweeter in taste, which is used in the preparation of iced drinks. In Kerala Malabar region of India, it is used for juice, pickles and chutney.

=== Essential oil ===
The essential oil obtained by steam distillation of ground nutmeg is used in the perfumery and pharmaceutical industries. The volatile fraction contains dozens of terpenes and phenylpropanoids, including -pinene, limonene, -borneol, -terpineol, geraniol, safrole, and myristicin. In its pure form, myristicin is a toxin, and consumption of excessive amounts of nutmeg can result in myristicin poisoning.

The oil is colorless or light yellow, and smells and tastes of nutmeg. It is used as a natural food flavoring in baked goods, syrups, beverages, and sweets. It is used to replace ground nutmeg, as it leaves no particles in the food. The essential oil is also used in the manufacturing of toothpaste and cough syrups.

=== Nutmeg butter ===
Nutmeg butter is obtained from the nut by expression. It is semisolid, reddish-brown in colour, and has the taste and smell of nutmeg itself. About 75% (by weight) of nutmeg butter is trimyristin, which can be turned into myristic acid, a 14-carbon fatty acid, which can be used as a replacement for cocoa butter, can be mixed with other fats like cottonseed oil or palm oil, and has applications as an industrial lubricant.

== History ==
The earliest evidence of use of nutmeg comes in the form of 3,500-year-old potsherd residues from the island of Pulau Ai, one of the Banda Islands in eastern Indonesia. The Banda Islands consist of eleven small volcanic islands, and are part of the larger Maluku Islands group. These islands were the only source of nutmeg and mace production until the mid-19th century. It was one of the spices traded over the Austronesian maritime spice trade network since at least 1500 BCE.

In the sixth century AD, nutmeg use spread to India, then further west to Constantinople. By the 13th century, Arab traders had pinpointed the origin of nutmeg to the Banda Islands, but kept this location a secret from European traders.

=== Colonial era ===
The Banda Islands became the scene of the earliest European ventures in Asia, to get a grip on the spice trade. In August 1511, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Malacca, which at the time was the hub of Asian trade, on behalf of the king of Portugal. In November of the same year, after having secured Malacca and learning of Banda&#x27;s location, Albuquerque sent an expedition of three ships led by his friend António de Abreu to find it. Malay pilots guided them via Java, the Lesser Sundas, and Ambon to the Banda Islands, arriving in early 1512. The first Europeans to reach the Banda Islands, the expedition remained for about a month, buying and filling their ships with Banda&#x27;s nutmeg and mace, and with cloves in which Banda had a thriving &quot;entrepôt&quot; trade. An early account of Banda is in &quot;Suma Oriental&quot;, a book written by the Portuguese apothecary Tomé Pires, based in Malacca from 1512 to 1515. Full control of this trade by the Portuguese was not possible, and they remained participants without a foothold in the islands.

In order to obtain a monopoly on the production and trade of nutmeg, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) waged a bloody battle with the Bandanese in 1621. Historian Willard Hanna estimated that before this struggle the islands were populated by approximately 15,000 people, and only 1,000 were left (the Bandanese were killed, starved while fleeing, exiled, or sold as slaves). The Company constructed a comprehensive nutmeg plantation system on the islands during the 17th century.

As a result of the Dutch interregnum during the Napoleonic Wars, the British invaded and temporarily took control of the Banda Islands from the Dutch and transplanted nutmeg trees, complete with soil, to Sri Lanka, Penang, Bencoolen, and Singapore. From these locations they were transplanted to their other colonial holdings elsewhere, notably Zanzibar and Grenada. The national flag of Grenada, adopted in 1974, shows a stylised split-open nutmeg fruit. The Dutch retained control of the Spice Islands until World War II.

Connecticut may have received its nickname (&quot;the Nutmeg State&quot;, &quot;Nutmegger&quot;) from the claim that some unscrupulous Connecticut traders would whittle &quot;nutmeg&quot; out of wood, creating a &quot;wooden nutmeg&quot;, a term which later came to mean any type of fraud. This narrative may have to do with the issue that one has to grate to obtain the spice powder, not crack a nutmeg, and this may not have been widely known by some purchasers of the product.

== Production ==
In 2019, global production of nutmeg was 142,000 tonnes, led by Indonesia, Guatemala, and India, having 38,000 to 43,000 tonnes each and a combined 85% of the world total.

== Psychoactivity and toxicity ==
Although used as a folk treatment for some ailments, nutmeg has no proven medicinal value.

=== Effects ===
Ingested in small amounts as a spice, nutmeg produces no noticeable physiological or neurological response, but in large doses, both raw nutmeg freshly ground from kernels and nutmeg oil have psychoactive effects. Such effects appear to derive from anticholinergic-like hallucinogenic mechanisms attributed to myristicin and elemicin. Myristicin—a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and psychoactive substance—can cause convulsions, palpitations, nausea, eventual dehydration, and generalized body pain when consumed in large amounts. Nutmeg may interact with anxiolytic drugs, produce allergic reactions, cause contact dermatitis, and evoke acute episodes of psychosis.

Varying considerably from person to person, nutmeg intoxication may occur with side effects, such as delirium, anxiety, confusion, headaches, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, eye irritation, and amnesia. Intoxication takes several hours to reach maximum effect, and may last for several days. Incidents of fatal poisoning from nutmeg and myristicin individually are uncommon.

Nutmeg poisonings occur by accidental consumption in children and by intentional recreational use. It is used recreationally with the intention of achieving a low-cost high resembling psychedelics, particularly by adolescents, drug users, college students, and prisoners. Relatively large doses of nutmeg are required to produce effects; a majority of reported nutmeg intoxication cases appear to result from recreational use.

Playwright and poet William Shakespeare was alleged to use nutmeg for hallucinogenic purposes as nutmeg extract along with cannabis were found in analysis of fragments of his pipe.

=== Toxicity during pregnancy ===
Nutmeg was once considered an abortifacient, but may be safe during pregnancy if used only in flavoring amounts. If consumed in large amounts, nutmeg could cause premature labor and miscarriage. Nutmeg may also interact with pain relievers such as pethidine, so avoiding it during pregnancy is recommended.

=== Toxicity to pets ===
The scent of nutmeg may attract pets, but it can be poisonous if consumed in excess.

<text>Dotdash Meredith (formerly The Mining Company, About.com and Dotdash) is an American digital media company based in New York City. The company publishes online articles and videos about various subjects across categories including health, home, food, finance, tech, beauty, lifestyle, travel, and education. It operates brands including Verywell, Investopedia, &quot;People&quot;, &quot;The Balance&quot;, Byrdie, MyDomaine, &quot;Brides&quot;, The Spruce, Simply Recipes, Serious Eats, Liquor.com, Lifewire, TripSavvy, TreeHugger, and ThoughtCo. In August 2012, About.com became a property of IAC, owner of Ask.com and numerous other online brands, and its revenue is generated by advertising. In addition to its Manhattan headquarters, Dotdash Meredith maintains offices elsewhere in the New York metropolitan area, as well as in Des Moines, Iowa, and Birmingham, Alabama. This company took its current name after IAC acquired Meredith Corporation and Time Inc.. Time had merged with Warner Communications in 1990 to form Time Warner, but was spun off as a publicly traded company in 2014. Time Warner kept its legal name until being acquired by AT&amp;T in 2018 and being renamed WarnerMedia.

==History==
===1997–2005: Launch, renaming, Primedia acquisition===
Founded in 1996 as The Mining Company, the site was launched on April 21, 1997, by Scott Kurnit, owner of General Internet, Bill Day, and a group of other entrepreneurs in New York City. The original goal was to maintain 1,800 topic areas, but after five years of operation, this number was reduced to around 700.

In May 1999, the company changed its name to &quot;About Inc.&quot; and the website name from &quot;miningco.com&quot; to &quot;about.com&quot;. The company was acquired by Primedia, Inc., in 2000 through a deal valued at US$690 million, whereby Primedia swapped 45.2 million shares for About, Inc.&#x27;s 18.1 million shares. At the time of the acquisition announcement, About Inc. was measured at US$133 million in cash and no debt (Sept. 30, 2000), while the Media Metrix company tallied 21 million unique monthly visitors—making it the seventh-most-visited &quot;network of sites&quot; at the time—a network of over 700 topic sites, sorted into 36 areas and 50,000 subjects, and approximately 4,000 advertisers. Following the purchase, which was finalized in the first quarter of 2001, the combined company was called &quot;Primedia&quot; and Kurnit remained chief executive officer (CEO).

===2005–2012: Times Co. acquisition, Abang.com, About en Español===
In February 2005, The New York Times Company (Times Co.) announced it was buying About.com, a purchase that was completed in the first half of the year for US$410 million. Google and Yahoo! were reportedly among the other bidders. Following the Times Co. acquisition, Peter C. Horan was appointed as About Inc.&#x27;s president and CEO, but he was soon replaced by Scott Meyer in May 2005.

In March 2007, About.com&#x27;s patronage was measured at 33.5 million unique visitors. On May 7, 2007, About Inc. acquired ConsumerSearch.com—a site that generated 3 million unique monthly visitors during the first quarter of 2007—for US$33 million in cash following two other purchases that were made in the preceding eight-month period: UCompareHealthCare.com and Calorie-Count.com.

Initially conceived of in January 2007, About.com&#x27;s first fully owned foreign venture, the China-based Abang.com, debuted in December 2007. At the time of the launch, the company had a Japan-based online entity, Allabout.co.jp, but it functioned under a licensing agreement. By January 2008, the China site consisted of around 25 employees, as well as 80 guides who were responsible for article production within seven categories: Fashion, Food, Health, Hobbies, Pets, Digital, and Travel. As part of the localization process, the China initiative—led by Matt Roberts, who became the CEO of Abang.com, and Wen-Wei Wang, the vice president of technology for the launch—was named &quot;Abang&quot; because the Chinese character &quot;bang&quot; refers to the concept of a group or community.

The About Group generated US$102.7 million in 2007, which represented a 135-percent increase from the time of the Times Co. acquisition. Meyer stepped down from the chief executive role in March 2008 and was replaced by Cella Irvine, who previously worked for Hearst Corp. and Microsoft Corp. In April 2011, Irvine launched the About en Español website, which was About&#x27;s first Spanish-language channel and initially featured nine topics, including movies and makeup, that were to be expanded by around 100 by the start of 2012. The launch was part of an overall strategy that included a redesigned About.com homepage, a doubling of the number of &quot;how-to&quot; and do-it-yourself videos on About.com&#x27;s 24 channels, and new outlets on About.com for advertisers.

The significant impact of the global financial crisis upon online advertising was experienced shortly after Irvine&#x27;s appointment and she was removed from the CEO role after three years and three consecutive quarters in which revenue decreased. Martin Nisenholtz, SVP of digital operations, temporarily replaced Irvine following her departure in May 2011.

In July 2011, Darline Jean was named CEO of the About Group, after the company&#x27;s second-quarter revenues totaled US$27.8 million. Jean previously served as About&#x27;s chief financial officer (CFO) and was promoted on September 1, 2011.

===2012–2017: IAC acquisition, Neil Vogel appointment, relaunch===
A media report published in August 2012 indicated that Answers.com had reached a preliminary agreement to acquire About.com for US$270 million. However, on August 26, Barry Diller&#x27;s IAC announced that it would acquire About.com instead for US$300 million in cash. A source for TechCrunch later confirmed that Answers.com&#x27;s offer was reportedly valued at US$270 million, but consisted of debt and equity in Answers.com.

In the corresponding press release, IAC explained that the acquisition would help bolster and accompany its existing properties, such as the Ask.com web search engine. Jean fulfilled her role as chief executive during the transition period, while ownership was transferred to IAC, and then left About.com shortly after the sale was finalized. At the time of the IAC acquisition, which was signed on August 26, 2012, About.com consisted of nearly 1,000 topic sites and over three million unique articles, while, in traffic terms, Alexa Internet ranked the site as number 37 in the U.S. and 80 in the global context.

On April 2, 2013, Neil Vogel became the new CEO of About.com. Up until March 2003, Vogel was a key executive member of the marketing and media company Alloy Inc., a role that he left to cofound the Recognition Media marketing business that is responsible for producing the annual Webby Awards event, as well as the Internet Week NY and Europe events. Vogel was selected by &quot;Business Insider&quot; for its 2012 &quot;The Coolest People In New York Tech This Year&quot; list, for his work as a venture partner of FirstMark Capital. , About.com was receiving about 84 million unique monthly visitors.

Following his appointment, Vogel&#x27;s overall plan for About focused on social, mobile, and user experience, with an emphasis on increasing the amount of time that users remain on the site, rather than attracting people in the first instance. Vogel also stressed the importance of monetization in his numerous post-appointment interviews and he included a summary of About&#x27;s revenue model as part of his discussion of the future with &quot;Bloomberg&quot;:

[We make money] one way, in general: we&#x27;re advertising-supported. And that&#x27;s monetized two ways: we do a lot of display advertising, and we do a lot of people clicking on links that we get paid for from Google and others ... If we have all this traffic, and we have all this content, if we can make people engage content more, and spend more time here [About.com], and do more things, we&#x27;re going to have more page views and much more of an opportunity to monetize About.

Vogel further explained that IAC has been able to create &quot;compelling&quot; content that manages to successfully engage Internet users, while About&#x27;s content, in particular, is favored by the Google search engine. Furthermore, Vogel stated that native advertising is a marketing initiative that he would like to explore with caution, as &quot;it&#x27;s a really big opportunity to let marketers talk to our audience in the voice that they&#x27;re already comfortable with.&quot;

In April 2014, Vogel revealed to the media that the About.com team had grown from 100 employees to 176, and the number of site contributors had increased by 20 percent. The company&#x27;s developers updated the website&#x27;s backend to be capable of handling a greater degree of interactivity at the front end, while a major emphasis was placed on responsive web design, as the traffic from mobile devices and tablets was measured at nearly 40 percent.

The About.com website was relaunched in September 2014, following a significant redesign that expanded upon the new homepage that debuted in July 2014. Based on an analysis of the needs of both users and advertisers, the redesign sought to create an improved user experience and facilitate social sharing, including the addition of social media buttons that were not featured at the time of Vogel&#x27;s appointment.

=== 2017–present: rebranding to Dotdash and merger with Meredith===

On May 2, 2017, IAC announced the completed rebranding of About.com to Dotdash, after about a year of transition. CEO Neil Vogel said that the company had lost mind share and needed to change their marketing strategy. According to &quot;WIRED&quot;, the About.com brand was retired, despite its profitability, to make way for a new business model. The company refocused on vertical markets through its niche websites: &quot;The Balance&quot; (personal finance), &quot;Lifewire&quot; (tech), &quot;The Spruce&quot; (home and food), &quot;VeryWell&quot; (health), &quot;TripSavvy&quot; (travel), and &quot;ThoughtCo&quot; (education).

On March 29, 2018, Dotdash won Digiday&#x27;s Publisher of the Year. In July of the same year, Dotdash acquired &quot;Investopedia&quot;. On October 15, TripSavvy launched the Editors&#x27; Choice Awards.

On January 8, 2019, Dotdash announced the acquisition of &quot;Byrdie&quot; (beauty) and &quot;MyDomaine&quot; (women&#x27;s lifestyle) from Clique Brands. On May 15, Dotdash announced the acquisition of &quot;Brides&quot; from Conde Nast. In the spring of 2019, Dotdash&#x27;s home site, &quot;The Spruce&quot;, announced the launch of their first-ever paint collection, The Spruce Best Home, in partnership with KILZ and sold exclusively on Amazon. On October 1, Dotdash announced the acquisition of Liquor.com.

On February 4, 2020, Dotdash announced the acquisition of &quot;TreeHugger&quot; and Mother Nature Network. In June, Dotdash was named Digiday&#x27;s Publisher of the Year in Digiday&#x27;s Media Awards 2020. &quot;The Spruce&quot; won for Best User Experience and CEO Neil Vogel won Executive of the Year. On September 22, Dotdash announced that it acquired &quot;Simply Recipes&quot; and &quot;Serious Eats&quot; from Fexy Media.

On October 6, 2021, Dotdash announced the acquisition of Meredith&#x27;s magazine and other non-broadcast assets (including the former Time Inc. assets) for $2.7 billion, forming a new entity called Dotdash Meredith. The transaction was finalized on December 1. On February 9, 2022, Dotdash CEO Neil Vogel issued a memo revealing that six former Meredith Corporation magazines (&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;InStyle&quot;, &quot;EatingWell&quot;, &quot;Health&quot;, &quot;Parents&quot;, and &quot;People en Español&quot;) would cease print circulation and switch to a digital-only format.

== Offices ==
Dotdash Meredith currently has offices at three locations in the USA including New York, Des Moines, and Birmingham.

<doc id="38556" wikidata="Q182162" url="?curid=38556" title="List of Swedish monarchs">
<text>This list records the monarchs of Sweden, from the late Viking Age to the present day. Sweden has continuously been a monarchy since the country&#x27;s consolidation in the Viking Age and early Middle Ages, for over a thousand years. The incumbent royal dynasty of Sweden is the House of Bernadotte, established on the throne in 1818.

== History ==
There were organized political structures in Sweden before the kingdom was unified; based on archaelogical evidence, early tribal societies are believed to have transitioned into organized chiefdoms in the first few centuries AD, perhaps spurred by contacts with the Roman Empire and the rest of Europe. In the period AD 500–800, Scandinavian societies began adopting cultural elements from the newly established Germanic kingdoms in Europe, transitioning further into petty kingdoms.

Archaeological evidence suggests that were numerous petty kingdoms throughout modern-day Sweden. Foreign sources and later native sources describe the later medieval kingdom as being composed of two main regions: Svealand (particularly around Lake Mälaren) and Götaland. Sources from as early as the Roman author Tacitus ( 56–126) mention two main peoples or tribes in modern Sweden: the &quot;Svear&quot; (Swedes) and &quot;Götar&quot; (Geats); the &quot;Svear&quot; are mentioned in more foreign sources than the &quot;Götar&quot;, credited with military activities at sea. The securely attested Swedish rulers in the Viking Age, predecessors of the later line of Swedish kings, ruled from the religious and political center of Old Uppsala; though its history before the Viking Age is poorly attested, it is probable that Old Uppsala had been a political and religious center since the Migration Period. 

The earliest historically attested Swedish rulers are 9th-century petty kings from the &quot;Vita Ansgarii&quot;, an account written 870 by Rimbert partly concerning Saint Ansgar&#x27;s visit to Svealand. Some kings of Old Uppsala are also mentioned in later Icelandic texts and sagas. The line of legendary Swedish kings from Icelandic tradition, called &quot;sagokungar&quot; in Swedish, are not generally treated as historical figures, though some may be based on actual chieftains or petty kings. Some later king-lists deliberately extended the sequence of kings for nationalistic purposes, such as Johannes Magnus&#x27;s &quot;Historia de omnibus Gothorum Sueonumque regibus&quot; (1554); supposed ancient kings mentioned in such sources are clearly fictional.

The petty kingdoms eventually gave rise to more complex political structures and what is today considered the beginning of the Swedish kingdom developed over the course of the Viking Age and the subsequent Middle Ages. For a consecutive list from then, the first Swedish king of whom anything definite is known is the 10th-century Eric the Victorious, though the information reported about him in different sources is scarce. Eric&#x27;s son Olof Skötkonung was the first king to be baptized in Sweden and is credited with founding a Christian kingdom. The early and then medieval Swedish kingdom was an elective monarchy, with kings being elected from particularly prominent families; this practice did however often result in &quot;de facto&quot; dynastic succession and the formation of royal dynasties, such as those of Eric (intermittently 1157–1250) and Bjelbo (1250–1364) as well as infighting between rival families.

From 1389 to 1523, Sweden was often united with Denmark and Norway under the kings of the Kalmar Union. Sweden&#x27;s full independence was restored under Gustav I in 1523. He is often credited as the founder of modern Sweden, and in 1544 he formally abandoned the previous elective monarchy in favor of hereditary succession. Initially adopting the medieval &quot;King of Swedes and Geats&quot;, Gustav I later adopted the lengthier title &quot;rex Svecorum Gothorum Vandalorumque&quot; (&quot;king of the Swedes, Geats and Wends&quot;). The last monarch to be titled as king of the Swedes, Geats and Wends was Gustaf VI Adolf () since his successor, the present king Carl XVI Gustaf, upon his accession adopted the shortened title &quot;King of Sweden&quot;.

In 1980, the rule of succession was changed from agnatic to absolute primogeniture, to the benefit of Princess Victoria (born 1977), the current heir apparent.

<doc id="38557" wikidata="Q17152442" url="?curid=38557" title="Outpatient commitment">
<text>Outpatient commitment—also called assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) or community treatment orders (CTO)—refers to a civil court procedure wherein a legal process orders an individual diagnosed with a severe mental disorder to adhere to an outpatient treatment plan designed to prevent further deterioration or recurrence that is harmful to themselves or others.

This form of involuntary treatment is distinct from involuntary commitment in that the individual subject to the order continues to live in their home community rather than being detained in hospital or incarcerated. The individual may be subject to rapid recall to hospital, including medication over objections, if the conditions of the order are broken, and the person&#x27;s mental health deteriorates. This generally means taking psychiatric medication as directed and may also include attending appointments with a mental health professional, and sometimes even not to take non-prescribed illicit drugs and not associate with certain people or in certain places deemed to have been linked to a deterioration in mental health in that individual.

The criteria and process for outpatient commitment are established by law, which vary among nations and, in the U.S. and Canada, among states or provinces. Some jurisdictions require court hearings, where a judge will make a court order, and others require that treating psychiatrists comply with a set of requirements before compulsory treatment is instituted. When a court process is not required, there is usually a form of appeal to the courts or appeal to or scrutiny by tribunals set up for that purpose. Community treatment laws have generally followed the worldwide trend of community treatment. See mental health law for details of countries which do not have laws that regulate compulsory treatment.

==Terminology==
In the United States the term &quot;assisted outpatient treatment&quot; (AOT) is often used and refers to a process whereby a judge orders a qualifying person with symptoms of severe untreated mental illness to adhere to a mental health treatment plan while living in the community. The plan typically includes medication and may include other forms of treatment as well. Patients are often monitored and assigned to case managers or a community dedicated to treating mental health known as assertive community treatment (ACT).

Australia, Canada, England, and New Zealand use the term &quot;community treatment order&quot; (CTO).

==Comparison to inpatient commitment==

The terminology, &quot;outpatient commitment&quot;, and legal construction often equate outpatient commitment with inpatient commitment but providing the patient more freedom. In practice, outpatient commitment may be used in situations where commitment would not be used because it is cheaper than inpatient commitment; seen as less draconian; and protects mental health professionals from moral, civil or criminal liability.

==Preventive use==

Outpatient commitment is used in some countries to prevent relapse of mental disorders, as many mental disorders are episodic in nature (for example bipolar disorder or schizophrenia) and it can be difficult to predict whether a mental disorder will reoccur. Some countries use outpatient commitment for first episode psychosis (FEP).

==Implementation==
Discussions of &quot;outpatient commitment&quot; began in the psychiatry community in the 1980s following deinstitutionalization, a trend that led to the widespread closure of public psychiatric hospitals and resulted in the discharge of large numbers of people with mental illness to the community. 

===Europe===
====Denmark====
Denmark introduced outpatient commitment in 2010 with the &quot;Mental Health Act&quot; ().

====Germany====
In Germany, CTOs were resumed in 2015 (formerly only for forensic psychiatry).
Laws regarding implementations are distincts between lander.

====France====
The CTOs are renewed every month. They were introduced under Nicolas Sarkozy presidency. Persons committed are registered on a national file accessible by police, even if they are not suspected of breaking the law.

====The Netherlands====
 Dutch law provides for community treatment orders, and an individual who does not comply with the terms of their CTO may be subject to immediate involuntary commitment.

====Norway====
When Norway introduced outpatient commitment in the 1961 &quot;Mental Health Act&quot;, it could only be mandated for individuals who had previously been admitted for inpatient treatment. Revisions in 1999 and 2006 provided for outpatient commitment without previous inpatient treatment, but this provision is seldom used.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, the &quot;Compulsory Psychiatric Care Act&quot; () provides for an administrative court to mandate psychiatric treatment to prevent harm to the individual or others. The law was created in 1991 and revised in 2008.

====England and Wales====
Changes in service provision and amendments to the Mental Health Act in England and Wales have increased the scope for compulsion in the community. The Mental Health Act 2007 introduced community treatment orders (CTOs). CTOs are legally defined as a form of outpatient leave for individuals detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act. As such, only members of the medical community are involved in issuing a CTO, though both the section 3 detention underlying the CTO and the CTO itself can be appealed to the Mental Health Tribunal where a panel consisting of medical doctors and a judge will make a decision.The legislation in the UK specifically allows CTOs to be issued after a single admission to hospital for treatment. However, the Royal College of Psychiatrists suggested limiting CTOs to patients with a history of noncompliance and hospitalization, when it reviewed the current mental health legislation.

John Mayer Chamberlain argues that this legislation was triggered by the Killing of Jonathan Zito by an individual who had interactions with mental health services prior this event, which led the then conservative government to argue for CTOs.

A review of patient data in London found that the average duration of a CTO in the UK was 3 years. Black people in the UK are more than ten times as likely to be under a CTO as white people. Concerns have been raised about the inability of Independent mental health advocates (IHMAs) to provide services to those under CTOs, since IMHAs cannot make contact with service users under CTOs and case workers could act as gatekeepers not providing referrals.

In a 2021 paper reviewing the mental health act, the UK government proposed a new form of indefinite outpatient commitment allowing for deprivation of liberties an continuous supervision termed supervised discharge. This discharge would be reviewed yearly, and only apply to individuals who would not benefit from treatment in a hospital setting and would be based on risk. Further, this legislation would only apply to restricted patients who have been diverted to the mental health care system from courts.

====Scotland====

Scotland has a different community commitment regime from England and Wales introduced in the 2003 Mental Health Act. There is ongoing debate in the UK on the place of coercion and compulsion in community mental health care.

====Luxembourg====
Patients may be recalled if they don&#x27;t abide to conditions on residence or medical supervision decided by a psychiatrist on discharge for 3 months after having been released from an involuntary commitment.

===North America===
In the last decade of the 20th century and the first of the 21st, &quot;outpatient commitment&quot; laws were passed in a number of U.S. states and jurisdictions in Canada.

====Canada====

In the mid-1990s, Saskatchewan became the first Canadian province to implement community treatment orders, and Ontario followed in 2000. New Brunswick was the only province without legislation that provided for either CTOs or extended leave.
====United States====

 44 U.S. states had enacted some version of an outpatient commitment law. In some cases, passage of the laws followed widely publicized tragedies, such as the murders of Laura Wilcox and Kendra Webdale.
===Oceania===
Australia and New Zealand introduced community treatment orders in the 1980s and 1990s.

====Australia====
In the Australian state of Victoria, community treatment orders last for a maximum of twelve months but can be renewed after review by a tribunal.

==Controversy==

Proponents have argued that outpatient commitment improves mental health, increases the effectiveness of treatment, lowers incidence of homelessness, arrest, incarceration and hospitalization and reduces costs. Opponents of outpatient commitment laws argue that they unnecessarily limit freedom, force people to ingest dangerous medications, impede on their human rights, or are applied with racial and socioeconomic biases.

===Arguments for and proponents===

While many outpatient commitment laws have been passed in response to violent acts committed by people with mental illness, most proponents involved in the outpatient commitment debate also make arguments based on the quality of life and cost associated with untreated mental illness and &quot;revolving door patients&quot; who experience a cycle of hospitalization, treatment and stabilization, release, and decompensation. While the cost of repeated hospitalizations is indisputable, quality-of-life arguments rest on an understanding of mental illness as an undesirable and dangerous state of being. Outpatient commitment proponents point to studies performed in North Carolina and New York that have found some positive impact of court-ordered outpatient treatment. Proponents include: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), U.S. Department of Justice, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), U. S Department of Health and Human Services, American Psychiatric Association, National Alliance on Mental Illness, International Association of Chiefs of Police. SAMHSA included Assisted Outpatient Treatment in their National Registry of Evidence Based Program and Practices. Crime Solutions: Management Strategies to Reduce Psychiatric Readmissions. The Treatment Advocacy Center are an advocacy group that campaign for the use of outpatient commitment.

A systematic review in 2016 that looked at around 200 papers investigating effectiveness of CTOs for patient outcomes. It found that non-randomized trials had dramatically varying results and found that no randomized controlled trials showed any benefits to the patient for outpatient commitment apart from a reduction in the risk of being the victim of crime.

The same interventions can have different effects in different countries due to legal, bureaucratic and social factors.

====Cost====

Research published in 2013 showed that Kendra&#x27;s Law in New York, which served about 2,500 patients at a cost of $32 million, had positive results in terms of net cost, reduced arrests. About $125 million is also spent annually on improved outpatient treatment for patients who are not subject to the law. In contrast to New York, despite wide adoption of outpatient commitment, the programs were generally not adequately funded.

&quot;Although numerous AOT programs currently operate across the United States, it is clear that the intervention is vastly underutilized.&quot;

====Arrests, danger, and violence====
The National Institute of Justice considers assisted outpatient treatment an effective crime prevention program. Some studies in the US have found that AOT programs have reduced the chances of arrest. Kendra&#x27;s Law has lowered risk of violent behaviors, reduced thoughts about suicide. 

====Outcomes and hospital admissions====
AOT &quot;programs improve adherence with outpatient treatment and have been shown to lead to significantly fewer emergency commitments, hospital admissions, and hospital days as well as a reduction in arrests and violent behavior.&quot;

74% fewer participants experienced homelessness. 77% fewer experienced psychiatric hospitalization. 56% reduction in length of hospitalization. 83% fewer experienced arrest. 87% fewer experienced incarceration. 49% fewer abused alcohol. 48% fewer abused drugs. Consumer participation and medication compliance improved. The number of individuals exhibiting good adherence to meds increased 51%. The number of individuals exhibiting good service engagement increased 103%. Consumer perceptions were positive. 75% reported that AOT helped them gain control over their lives. 81% said AOT helped them get and stay well. 90% said AOT made them more likely to keep appointments and take meds. 87% of participants said they were confident in their case manager&#x27;s ability. 88% said they and their case manager agreed on what was important to work on.

In Nevada County, CA, AOT (&quot;Laura&#x27;s Law&quot;) decreased the number of psychiatric hospital days 46.7%, the number of incarceration days 65.1%, the number of homeless days 61.9%, and the number of emergency interventions 44.1%. Laura&#x27;s Law implementation saved $1.81–$2.52 for every dollar spent, and receiving services under Laura&#x27;s Law caused a &quot;reduction in actual hospital costs of $213,300&quot; and a &quot;reduction in actual incarceration costs of $75,600.&quot;

In New Jersey, Kim Veith, director of clinical services at Ocean Mental Health Services, noted the AOT pilot program performed &quot;beyond wildest dreams.&quot; AOT reduced hospitalizations, shortened inpatient stays, reduced crime and incarceration, stabilized housing, and reduced homelessness. Of clients who were homeless, 20% are now in supportive housing, 40% are in boarding homes, and 20% are living successfully with family members.

Writing in the &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot; in 2013, Jorun Rugkåsa and John Dawson stated, &quot;The current evidence from suggests that do not reduce readmission rates over 12 months.&quot;

&quot;We find that New York State&#x27;s AOT Program improves a range of important outcomes for its recipients, apparently without feared negative consequences to recipients.&quot;

&quot;The increased services available under AOT clearly improve recipient outcomes, however, the AOT court order, itself, and its monitoring do appear to offer additional benefits in improving outcomes.&quot;

====Effect on mental illness system====
=====Access to services=====


In New York City net costs declined 50% in the first year after assisted outpatient treatment began and an additional 13% in the second year. In non-NYC counties, costs declined 62% in the first year and an additional 27% in the second year. This was in spite of the fact that psychotropic drug costs increased during the first year after initiation of assisted outpatient treatment, by 40% and 44% in the city and five-county samples, respectively. The increased community-based mental health costs were more than offset by the reduction in inpatient and incarceration costs. Cost declines associated with assisted outpatient treatment were about twice as large as those seen for voluntary services.



=====Race=====


=====Service engagement=====

Consumers approve. Despite being under a court order to participate in treatment, current AOT recipients feel neither more positive nor more negative about their treatment experiences than comparable individuals who are not under AOT.&quot;

In Los Angeles, CA, the AOT pilot program reduced incarceration 78%, hospitalization 86%, hospitalization after discharge from the program 77%, and cut taxpayer costs 40%.

In North Carolina, AOT reduced the percentage of persons refusing medications to 30%, compared to 66% of patients not under AOT.

In Ohio, AOT increased attendance at outpatient psychiatric appointments from 5.7 to 13.0 per year. It increased attendance at day treatment sessions from 23 to 60 per year. &quot;During the first 12 months of outpatient commitment, patients experienced significant reductions in visits to the psychiatric emergency service, hospital admissions, and lengths of stay compared with the 12 months before commitment.&quot;

In Arizona, &quot;71% [of AOT patients] ... voluntarily maintained treatment contacts six months after their orders expired&quot; compared with &quot;almost no patients&quot; who were not court-ordered to outpatient treatment.

In Iowa, &quot;it appears as though outpatient commitment promotes treatment compliance in about 80% of patients... After commitment is terminated, about ¾ of that group remain in treatment on a voluntary basis.&quot;

===Arguments against and opponents===
Human rights advocate considers it a violation of freedom of thought or opinion, or views the use of neuroleptic as degrading treatment that can also impede on their right to work due to sometimes handicapping side effects. Other argue for a right of self-determination or self ownership, considering it a paternalistic approach that can be wrongly applied considering psychiatry criteria for diagnosis are very subjective backed by some studies questioning diagnosis (see Rosenhan experiment), the unlimited duration with often lack or no foresight to an end from the patient is also criticised. 
Some opponents dispute the effects of compulsory treatment as positive, questioning the methodology of studies that show effectiveness. Some point to disparities in the way these laws are applied.

Opponents claim they are giving medication to the patient, but there are no brain chemical imbalances to correct in &quot;mental illness&quot;. Our ability to control ourselves and reason comes from the mind, and the brain is being reduced in size from the psychiatric medications.

The slippery slope argument of &quot;If government bodies are given power, they will use it in excess.&quot; was proven when 350–450 CTOs were expected to be issued in 2008 and more than five times that number were issued in the first few months. Every year there are increasing numbers of people subject to CTO&#x27;s.

The psychiatric survivors movement opposes compulsory treatment on the basis that the ordered drugs often have serious or unpleasant side-effects such as tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, akathisia, excessive weight gain leading to diabetes, addiction, sexual side effects, increased risk of suicide and QT prolongation. The New York Civil Liberties Union has denounced what they see as racial and socioeconomic biases in the issuing of outpatient commitment orders. The main opponents to any kind of coercion, including the outpatient commitment and any other form of involuntary commitment, are Giorgio Antonucci and Thomas Szasz.

<text>Styles represent the fashion by which monarchs and noblemen are properly addressed. Throughout history, many different styles were used, with little standardization. This page will detail the various styles used by royalty and nobility in Europe, in the final form arrived at in the nineteenth century.

==Imperial, royal, and princely styles==
Only those classified within the social class of royalty and upper nobility have a style of &quot;Highness&quot; attached before their titles. Reigning bearers of forms of Highness included grand princes, grand dukes, reigning princes, reigning dukes, and princely counts, their families, and the agnatic (of the male bloodline) descendants of emperors and kings. Royalty (usually emperors to princely counts) are all considered sovereign princes ().

*Emperors and empresses held the style of Imperial Majesty (HIM).
*Members of imperial families generally hold the style of Imperial Highness (HIH).
*In the Austrian Empire, the Emperor was also the King of Hungary, and thus bore the style of Imperial and Royal Majesty. Subsequently, members of the imperial family, who were also members of the royal family of Hungary, held the style of Imperial and Royal Highness (HI&amp;RH). Abbreviation to Imperial Highness is common and accepted.
*In the German Empire, the other &quot;heir&quot; to the Holy Roman Empire, the Emperor and Empress were also addressed as Imperial and Royal Majesty, as they ruled over both the German Empire and Kingdom of Prussia. Similarly, the Crown Prince of the Empire and Prussia was styled Imperial and Royal Highness. Other members of the House of Prussia, having no constitutional place in the Empire as such, were only entitled to the style of Royal Highness.
*In Imperial Russia, children and male-line grandchildren of the Emperor bore the style of Imperial Highness. Male-line great-grandchildren held the style of Highness; also, the eldest son of any person who held the style of Highness also held the style of Highness. All other male-line descendants held the style of Serenity, often translated as &quot;Serene Highness&quot;. Some Russian noble princes also hold the style of Serenity; all others and Russian princely counts hold the style of Illustriousness, often translated as &quot;Illustrious Highness&quot;.
*Kings and queens have the style of His/Her Majesty.
*Members of royal families (princes and princesses) generally have the style of Royal Highness, although in some royal families (for instance, Denmark and Norway), more junior princes and princesses bear the style of Highness.
*Reigning grand dukes and grand duchesses hold the style of Royal Highness.
*The styles of members of grand ducal families have been inconsistent. In Luxembourg, more senior members of the family have also been Royal Highnesses, but only due to their status as Princes of Bourbon-Parma (itself an inconsistency as Parma was only ducal, but this family has male-line descent from kings of Etruria, Spain and France). In Baden and Hesse and by Rhine, junior members held the style of Grand Ducal Highness. Members of other grand ducal families (for instance, Oldenburg) generally held the style of Highness.
*Reigning dukes and duchesses bore the style of Highness, as did other members of ducal families. Junior members of some ducal families bore the style of Ducal Serene Highness, although it fell out of fashion.
*The elector of Hesse-Kassel also bore the style of Highness, as did other members of the Hesse-Kassel family.
*Reigning princes bear the style of Serene Highness (, ), as do other members of princely families. Mediatized dukes and princes also bear the style of Serene Highness.
*Mediatized princely counts and countesses bear the style of Illustrious Highness (HIllH, ).

In addition to their national royal styles, many monarchs have or had &quot;treaty styles&quot; to distinguish one monarch from another in international settings. For example, the sovereign of France was styled &quot;Most Christian Majesty&quot;, the King of Hungary as &quot;Apostolic Majesty&quot;, of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation as &quot;August Majesty&quot;. The sovereign of the United Kingdom is customarily referred to as &quot;Britannic Majesty&quot;, the king of Spain as His &quot;Catholic Majesty&quot;, etc. Monarchs also typically have a longer style than other princely members within the same royal house. For example, the monarch of the United Kingdom has a much longer style than that of other members of the British royal family. The full style and titles of King Charles III in the United Kingdom are &quot;His Majesty Charles the Third, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of His other Realms and Territories King, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith&quot;.

==Royal and noble styles in France==
* Before the French Revolution, and from 1814 to 1830 (apart from a brief period in 1815), the King of France used the formal style of Most High, Most Potent and Most Excellent Prince () or Most Christian Majesty (). For general usage, however, until the final end of the Bourbon monarchy in 1830, kings and queens of France were styled Majesty () 
* Children and male-line grandchildren of the King used the style of Most High, Most Potent and Excellent Prince or Princess () or Royal Highness () and Lord () followed by their main title.
** Louis, Grand Dauphin was referred to by the title Monseigneur only, while retaining the style of Royal Highness
** The eldest unmarried daughter of the King was referred to by the title Madame only, while retaining the style of Royal Highness
** Younger unmarried daughters of the King were referred to by the title Madame followed by their first name, while retaining the style of Royal Highness
** The oldest brother of the King was referred to by the title Monsieur only, while retaining the style of Royal Highness
*** His eldest unmarried daughter was referred to by the title Mademoiselle only, while retaining the style of Royal Highness.
*** Younger unmarried daughters of Monsieur were referred to by the title Mademoiselle followed by their main title, while retaining the style of Royal Highness
** Younger brothers of the King used only the style of Monseigneur, followed by their main title.
* Princes of the Blood used the style of Most High, Most Potent and Excellent Prince or Princess () or Serene Highness () and Monseigneur or Mademoiselle followed by their main title.
** Until 1707, the First Prince of the Blood (head of the House of Condé) was referred to by the title Monsieur le Prince only, while retaining the style of Serene Highness
** After 1707, the head of the House of Condé was referred to by the title Monsieur le Duc only, while retaining the style of Serene Highness
* Foreign and legitimized princes used the title of High and Potent Prince () and claimed the right to use the style of Highness () and Monseigneur followed by their main title.
* Dukes and Peers used the style of Most High and Most Potent Lord (), but in the 18th century, that style was used by lesser-ranked nobles
* Other titled nobility used the style of Most High and Potent Lord () or High and Potent Lord ()

== Noble styles in the United Kingdom ==

*Dukes and duchesses in the peerages of England, Scotland, Great Britain, Ireland, and the United Kingdom (who are not royalty or highness) bear the styles of &quot;Grace&quot; (e.g. &quot;His Grace&quot;, &quot;Her Grace&quot;, or &quot;Your Grace&quot;) and &quot;Most Noble&quot;. They also hold the style of &quot;Most High, Potent, and Noble Prince&quot;, but even in the most formal situations, this is usually shortened to The Most Noble, which is still considered to be very formal. The Crown officially addresses them as &quot;Our right trust and right entirely beloved Cousin&quot;.
*Marquesses and marchionesses bear the styles of The Most Honourable and Lordship (e.g. &quot;His Lordship&quot;, &quot;Her Ladyship&quot;, &quot;Your Lordship&quot;, or &quot;Your Ladyship&quot;). They also hold the style of &quot;Most Noble and Puissant Prince&quot;, but even in the most formal situations, this style is rarely used.
*The style of an Earl and a Countess (in her own right) is &quot;Right Honourable&quot; and they are officially, albeit archaically, addressed by the Crown as &quot;Our right trusty and right well-beloved Cousin&quot;. On some occasions, an Earl may bear the title of &quot;Most Noble and Puissant Prince&quot;.
*The style of a Viscount and a Viscountess (in her own right) is also &quot;Right Honourable&quot; and they are officially addressed by the Crown as &quot;Our right trust and well-beloved Cousin&quot;.
*Barons, baronesses, Scottish Lords of Parliament, and Scottish Ladies of Parliament bear the styles of The Right Honourable and Lordship.
*Scottish Barons and Baronesses bear the style of The Much Honoured.

== Belgium ==
* Archdukes are always styled Your Royal and Imperial Highness.
* Princes of noble blood, Your Serene Highness, and addressed monseigneur.
* Dukes are addressed as Monseigneur.

== Burma ==
* Royal descendants of King Thibaw are always styled Your Royal and Grand Highness
* Princes and Princessess of noble blood, Your Serene Highness, and addressed Hteik Tin (Burmese: ထိပ်တင်).

==Noble styles in Germany==

===Mediatized nobility===
*Mediatized dukes () and princes () in Germany bore the style of Serene Highness () or, in the case of dukes, Ducal Serene Highness. With regard to dukes, this fell out of use in the 19th century, at least for the reigning members (who are styled as Highness).
*Mediatized counts () in Germany bore the style of Illustrious Highness ().

===Non-mediatized nobility===
*Non-mediatized noble dukes () and princes () used to bear the title of Ducal/Princely Grace (). They were rare, though, and at the beginning of the 20th century, they were altogether granted the style of Serene Highness by Emperor Franz Joseph I.
*Non-mediatized counts () in Germany bore the style of High-born ().
*Other German nobles below the rank of count bore the style of High Well-born (). Another style was Well-born (), which ranked below High Well-born but was not used for proper nobility and therefore fell out of use.

<doc id="38566" wikidata="Q1186660" url="?curid=38566" title="Inverse multiplexer">
<text>An inverse multiplexer (often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX) allows a data stream to be broken into multiple lower data rate communication links. An inverse multiplexer differs from a demultiplexer because the multiple output streams from the former stay inter-related, whereas those from the latter are unrelated. An inverse multiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer in that it divides one high-speed link into multiple low-speed links, whereas a multiplexer combines multiple low-speed links into one high-speed link.

This provides an end to end connection of several times the data rate available on each of the low rate data links. Note that, as with multiplexers, links are often used in bi-directional pairs and, at either end of the link, an inverse multiplexer will be combined with its reverse (an inverse demultiplexer) and still be called an &quot;inverse MUX&quot;.

Inverse multiplexers are used, for example, to combine a number of ISDN channels together into one high rate circuit, where a higher rate connection than is available from a single ISDN connection is needed. This is typically useful in areas where higher rate circuits are not available.

An alternative to an inverse multiplexer is to use separate links and load sharing of data between them. In the case of IP, network packets could be sent in round-robin mode between each separate link. Advantages of using inverse multiplexing over separate links include:

* Lower link latency (one single packet can be spread across all links)
* Fairer load balancing 
* Network simplicity (no network switch needed between boxes with high-speed interfaces)

A simple analogy to transport can help explain the distinction between multiplexing and inverse multiplexing. When small cargoes such as pencils are shipped overseas, they are generally not carried one at a time, but are assembled into small boxes, which are grouped into larger cartons, which go into intermodal containers, which are packed onto a container ship. Each step is analogous to a multiplexing process. Conversely a large cargo, for example in structure relocation, may be disassembled for carriage on multiple vehicles and reassembled at the destination. This is analogous to inverse multiplexing.

<text>Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon (Margaret Rose; 21 August 1930 – 9 February 2002) was the younger daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. She was the younger sister and only sibling of Queen Elizabeth II.

Margaret was born when her parents were the Duke and Duchess of York, and she spent much of her childhood with them and her elder sister. Her life changed at the age of six, when her father succeeded to the British throne following the abdication of his brother Edward VIII. Margaret&#x27;s sister became heir presumptive, with Margaret second in line to the throne. Her position in the line of succession diminished over the following decades as Elizabeth&#x27;s children and grandchildren were born. During the Second World War, the two sisters stayed at Windsor Castle despite suggestions to evacuate them to Canada. During the war years, Margaret was too young to perform official duties and continued her education, being nine years old when the war broke out and turning fifteen just after hostilities ended.

From the 1950s onwards, Margaret became one of the world&#x27;s most celebrated socialites, famed for her glamorous lifestyle and reputed romances. Most famously, she fell in love in the early 1950s with Peter Townsend, a married RAF officer in the royal household. In 1952, her father died, her sister became queen, and Townsend divorced his wife. He proposed to Margaret early in the following year. Many in the government believed that he would be an unsuitable husband for the Queen&#x27;s 22-year-old sister, and the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to countenance her marriage to a divorced man. Margaret abandoned her plans with Townsend. In 1960, she married Antony Armstrong-Jones, whom Elizabeth created Earl of Snowdon. The couple had two children, David and Sarah. Margaret&#x27;s marriage to Lord Snowdon became strained, with both of them engaging in extramarital affairs. They separated in 1976 and divorced in 1978. Margaret did not remarry.

Margaret was a controversial member of the British royal family. Her divorce received much negative publicity, and her private life was for many years the subject of speculation by media and royal watchers. Her health deteriorated in the last twenty years of her life. She was a heavy smoker for most of her adult life, and had a lung operation in 1985 and a bout of pneumonia in 1993, as well as three strokes between 1998 and 2001. Margaret died in 2002 aged 71, after suffering her fourth stroke.

==Early life==
Princess Margaret was born at 9:22 p.m. on 21 August 1930 at Glamis Castle in Scotland, her mother&#x27;s ancestral home, and was affectionately known as Margot within the royal family. She was the first member of the royal family in direct line of succession to be born in Scotland since the 1600s. She was delivered by Sir Henry Simson, the royal obstetrician. The Home Secretary, J. R. Clynes, was present to verify the birth. The registration of her birth was delayed for several days to avoid her being numbered thirteen in the parish register. Margaret was baptised in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 30 October 1930 by Cosmo Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury.

At the time of her birth, Margaret was fourth in the line of succession to the British throne. She was the younger daughter of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary, and her mother was the youngest daughter of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne. The Duchess of York originally wanted to name her second daughter Ann Margaret, as she explained to Queen Mary in a letter: &quot;I am very anxious to call her Ann Margaret, as I think Ann of York sounds pretty, &amp; Elizabeth and Ann go so well together.&quot; George V disliked the name Ann but approved of the alternative, Margaret Rose.

Margaret&#x27;s early life was spent primarily at the Yorks&#x27; residences at 145 Piccadilly (their town house in London) and Royal Lodge in Windsor. The Yorks were perceived by the public as an ideal family, but unfounded rumours that Margaret was deaf and mute were not completely dispelled until her first main public appearance at her uncle Prince George&#x27;s wedding in 1934.
Margaret was educated alongside her sister, Elizabeth, by their Scottish governess, Marion Crawford. Margaret&#x27;s education was mainly supervised by her mother, who in the words of Randolph Churchill &quot;never aimed at bringing her daughters up to be more than nicely behaved young ladies&quot;. When Queen Mary insisted upon the importance of education, the Duchess of York commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what she meant. After all I and my sisters only had governesses and we all married well — one of us &quot;very&quot; well&quot;. Margaret was resentful about her limited education, especially in later years, and aimed criticism at her mother. However, Margaret&#x27;s mother told a friend that she &quot;regretted&quot; that her daughters did not go to school like other children, and the employment of a governess rather than sending the girls to school may have been done only at the insistence of their grandfather George V. J. M. Barrie, author of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, read stories to the sisters as children.

Margaret&#x27;s grandfather died in January 1936, and her uncle acceded to the throne as Edward VIII. Less than a year later, in December 1936, Edward abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American, whom neither the Church of England nor the Dominion governments would accept as queen. The Church did not recognise the marriage of a divorced woman with a living ex-husband as valid. Edward&#x27;s abdication made Margaret&#x27;s father reluctantly assume the throne, and Margaret became second in line to the throne, with the title &quot;The Princess Margaret&quot; to indicate her status as a child of the sovereign. The family moved into Buckingham Palace; Margaret&#x27;s room overlooked The Mall.
Margaret was a Brownie in the 1st Buckingham Palace Brownie Pack, formed in 1937. She was also a Girl Guide and later a Sea Ranger. She served as President of Girlguiding UK from 1965 until her death on 9 February 2002.

At the outbreak of World War II, Princesses Margaret and Elizabeth were at Birkhall, on the Balmoral Castle estate, where they stayed until Christmas 1939, enduring nights so cold that drinking water in carafes by their bedside froze. They spent Christmas at Sandringham House before moving to Windsor Castle, just outside London, for much of the remainder of the war. Lord Hailsham wrote to Winston Churchill to advise the evacuation of the princesses to the greater safety of Canada, to which their mother famously replied, &quot;The children won&#x27;t go without me. I won&#x27;t leave without the King. And the King will never leave.&quot; At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen&#x27;s Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments. In 1940, Margaret sat next to Elizabeth during their radio broadcast for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, addressing other children who had been evacuated from cities. Margaret spoke at the end by wishing all the children goodnight.
Unlike other members of the royal family, Margaret was not expected to undertake any public or official duties during the war. She developed her skills at singing and playing the piano, often show tunes from stage musicals. Her contemporaries thought she was spoiled by her parents, especially her father, who allowed her to take liberties not usually permissible, such as being allowed to stay up to dinner at the age of thirteen.

Crawford despaired at the attention Margaret was getting, writing to friends: &quot;Could you this year only ask Princess Elizabeth to your party? ... Princess Margaret does draw all the attention and Princess Elizabeth lets her do that.&quot; Elizabeth, however, did not mind this, and commented, &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s so much easier when Margaret&#x27;s there—everybody laughs at what Margaret says&quot;. Their father described Elizabeth as his pride and Margaret as his joy. When Elizabeth joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service in 1945, Margaret became extremely jealous, lamenting, &quot;I was born too late!&quot; as she was too young to join herself.

==Post-war years==

At the end of the war in 1945, Margaret appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill. Afterwards, both Elizabeth and Margaret joined the crowds outside the palace, incognito, chanting, &quot;We want the King, we want the Queen!&quot; They both joined in on the festivities with their fellow British citizens, such as playing the &quot;hokey cokey&quot;, &quot;Lambeth Walk&quot; and conga. &quot;I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, and all of us were swept along by tides of happiness and relief,&quot; Elizabeth later recalled. Margaret and Elizabeth were &quot;terrified&quot; of being recognised, so they did their best to stay hidden in plain sight.

On 15 April 1946, Margaret was confirmed into the Church of England. On 1 February 1947, she, Elizabeth and their parents embarked on a state tour of Southern Africa. The three-month-long visit was Margaret&#x27;s first visit abroad, and she later claimed that she remembered &quot;every minute of it&quot;. Her chaperon was Peter Townsend, the King&#x27;s equerry and very firm toward Margaret, whom he apparently considered an indulged child. In November 1947, Margaret was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten. In the next three years, Elizabeth and Philip had two children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne, whose births moved Margaret further down the line of succession.

In 1950, the former royal governess, Marion Crawford, published an unauthorized biography of Elizabeth&#x27;s and Margaret&#x27;s childhood years, titled &quot;The Little Princesses&quot;, in which she described Margaret&#x27;s &quot;light-hearted fun and frolics&quot; and her &quot;amusing and outrageous ... antics&quot;.

=== The Margaret Set ===
Around the time of Elizabeth&#x27;s wedding, the press started to follow the social life of &quot;unconventional&quot; Margaret and her reputation for vivacity and wit. A young woman with &quot;vivid blue eyes&quot;, Margaret enjoyed socialising with high society and young aristocrats, including Sharman Douglas, the daughter of the American ambassador, Lewis Williams Douglas. A celebrated beauty known for her glamour and fashion sense, Margaret was often featured in the press at balls, parties, and nightclubs with friends who became known as the &quot;Margaret Set&quot;. The number of her official engagements increased (they included a tour of Italy, Switzerland, and France), and she joined a growing number of charitable organisations as president or patron.
Favoured haunts of the Margaret Set were The 400 Club, the Café de Paris and the Mirabelle restaurant. Anticipation of an engagement or romance between Margaret and a member of her set were often reported. In 1948, international news grew that her engagement to the Marquess of Blandford would be announced on her 18th birthday. Similar speculation moved to the Hon. Peter Ward, then Billy Wallace and others. The set also mixed with celebrities, including Danny Kaye, whom she met after watching him perform at the London Palladium in February 1948. He was soon accepted by the royal social circle. In July 1949, at a fancy dress ball at the US ambassador&#x27;s residence, Margaret performed the can-can on stage, accompanied by Douglas and ten other costumed girls. A press commotion ensued, with Kaye denying he had taught Margaret the dance. Press interest could be intrusive. During a private visit to Paris in 1951, Margaret and Prince Nicholas of Yugoslavia were followed into a nightclub by a paparazzo who took photographs of them until British detectives physically removed him from the club.

In 1952, although Margaret attended parties and debutante balls with friends such as Douglas and Mark Bonham Carter, the set were seen infrequently together. They regrouped in time for Coronation season social functions. In May 1953, Margaret met singer Eddie Fisher when he performed at the Red, White and Blue Ball. She asked him to her table and he was &quot;invited to all sorts of parties&quot;. Margaret fell out with him in 1957, but years later, Fisher still claimed the night he was introduced to her was the greatest thrill of his lifetime. In June 1954, the Set performed the Edgar Wallace play &quot;The Frog&quot; at the Scala Theatre. It was organised by Margaret&#x27;s by now best girlfriend Judy Montagu with Margaret as assistant director. It drew praise for raising £10,500 for charity, but criticism for incompetent performances. By the mid-1950s, although still seen at fashionable nightspots and theatre premieres, the set was depleted by its members getting married. As she reached her late twenties unmarried, the press increasingly turned from predicting whom she might marry to suspecting she would remain a spinster.

=== &#x27;Romances&#x27; and the press (1947–1959) ===
The press avidly discussed &quot;the world&#x27;s most eligible bachelor-girl&quot; and her alleged romances with more than 30 bachelors, including David Mountbatten, Michael I of Romania, Dominic Elliot, Colin Tennant (later Baron Glenconner), Prince Henry of Hesse-Kassel, and future Canadian prime minister John Turner. Most had titles and almost all were wealthy. Lord Blandford and Lord Dalkeith, both wealthy sons of dukes, were the likeliest potential husbands. Her family reportedly hoped that Margaret would marry Dalkeith, but, unlike him, Margaret was uninterested in the outdoors. Billy Wallace, sole heir to a £2.8 million (£ million today) fortune and an old friend, was reportedly Margaret&#x27;s favourite date during the mid-1950s. During her 21st birthday party at Balmoral in August 1951, the press was disappointed to only photograph Margaret with Townsend, always in the background of pictures of royal appearances, and to her parents a safe companion as Elizabeth&#x27;s duties increased. The following month her father underwent surgery for lung cancer, and Margaret was appointed one of the Counsellors of State who undertook the King&#x27;s official duties while he was incapacitated. Her father died five months later, on 6 February 1952, and her sister acceded as Elizabeth II.

==Romance with Peter Townsend==

===Early relationship===
During the war, the King suggested choosing palace aides who were highly qualified men from the military, instead of only aristocrats. Told that a handsome war hero had arrived, the princesses met Townsend, the new equerry, on his first day at Buckingham Palace in 1944; Elizabeth reportedly told her sister, 13 years old, &quot;Bad luck, he&#x27;s married&quot;. A temporary assignment of three months from the RAF became permanent. The King and Queen were fond of Townsend; the King reportedly saw the calm and efficient war veteran as the son he never had. He may have been aware of Margaret&#x27;s infatuation with the non-titled and non-wealthy Townsend, reportedly seeing the courtier reluctantly obey the princess&#x27;s order to carry her up palace stairs after a party.

Townsend was so often near Margaret that gossip columnists overlooked him as a suitor for the princess. When their relationship began is unclear. Margaret told friends she fell in love with him during the 1947 South Africa tour, where they often went riding together. Her biographer Craig Brown stated that, according to a National Trust curator, Townsend requested the bedroom next to hers during a trip to Belfast in October 1947. In November 1948, they attended the inauguration of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. In later life, Townsend admitted at this point there was an attraction between them, but neither of them ever acknowledged it to one another. Not long after, he discovered his wife Rosemary was involved in an extramarital affair, which ended. Contemporary anecdotes about their closeness then dissipated until late 1950, when friendship seems to have rekindled, coinciding with Townsend&#x27;s appointment as Deputy Master of the Household and the breakdown of his marriage.

From the spring of 1951 came several testimonies of a growing romantic attraction. A footman told how the King diverted the pair&#x27;s picnic plans, adding that whatever the King and Queen knew about the developing relationship, few royal staff failed to notice as it was obvious to them. Townsend said that his love for her began in Balmoral in 1951, and recalled an incident there in August when the princess woke him from a nap after a picnic lunch while the King watched, to suggest the King knew. Townsend and his wife separated in 1951, which was noticed by the press by July.

Margaret was grief-stricken by her father&#x27;s death and was prescribed sedatives to help her sleep. Of her father she wrote, &quot;He was such a wonderful person, the very heart and centre of our happy family.&quot; She was consoled by her deeply held Christian beliefs, sometimes attending church twice daily. She re-emerged attending events with her family in April and returned to public duties and the social scene when official mourning ended in June. American newspapers noted her increasing vitality and speculated that she must be in love. With the widowed Queen Mother, Margaret moved out of Buckingham Palace and into Clarence House in May 1953, while the new queen and her family moved out of Clarence House and into Buckingham Palace. After George VI&#x27;s death, Townsend was appointed Comptroller of the Queen Mother&#x27;s household.

In June 1952, the estranged Townsends hosted Margaret, along with her sister Elizabeth and brother-in-law Philip, at a cocktail party at their home. A month later, Rosemary Townsend and her new partner John de László attended judging at the Royal Windsor Horse Show. It is thought the romance between Margaret and Townsend began around this time. The first reports that Townsend and Margaret wished to marry began in August 1952, but these remained uncommon. The Townsend divorce in November was mentioned little in Britain and in greater detail abroad. After the divorce was finalized in December 1952, however, rumours spread about him and Margaret; the divorce, and shared grief over the King&#x27;s death in February 1952, likely helped them come together within the privacy of Clarence House, where Margaret had her own apartment.

===Marriage proposal===
Private Secretary to the Queen Sir Alan Lascelles wrote that Townsend told Lascelles he had asked Margaret to marry him shortly before Christmas 1952. Other sources claim it occurred in February or April 1953. He was 15 years her senior and had two children from his previous marriage. Margaret accepted and informed her sister, the Queen, whose consent was required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772. During the abdication crisis, the Church of England had refused to countenance the remarriage of the divorced. Queen Mary had recently died, and, after the coronation of Elizabeth II, the new queen planned to tour the Commonwealth for six months. She told her sister, &quot;Under the circumstances, it isn&#x27;t unreasonable for me to ask you to wait a year&quot;, and to keep the relationship secret until after the coronation.
Although foreign media speculated on Margaret and Townsend&#x27;s relationship, the British press did not. After reporters saw her plucking fluff from his coat during the coronation on 2 June 1953—&quot;I never thought a thing about it, and neither did Margaret&quot;, Townsend later said; &quot;After that the storm broke&quot;—&quot;The People&quot; first mentioned the relationship in Britain on 14 June. With the headline &quot;They Must Deny it NOW&quot;, the front-page article warned that &quot;scandalous rumours about Princess Margaret are racing around the world&quot;, which the newspaper stated were &quot;of course, utterly untrue&quot;. The foreign press believed that the Regency Act 1953—which made Prince Philip regent instead of Margaret on the Queen&#x27;s death—was enacted to allow Margaret to marry Townsend, but as late as 23 July most other British newspapers except the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; did not discuss the rumours. Acting Prime Minister Rab Butler asked that the &quot;deplorable speculation&quot; end, without mentioning Margaret or Townsend.

The constitutional crisis that the proposed marriage caused was public. The Queen was advised by Lascelles to post Townsend abroad, but she refused and instead transferred him from the Queen Mother&#x27;s household to her own, although Townsend did not accompany Margaret as planned on a tour of Southern Rhodesia. Winston Churchill personally approved of &quot;a lovely young royal lady married to a gallant young airman&quot;, but Clementine Churchill reminded her husband that he had made the same mistake during the abdication crisis. The Cabinet refused to approve the marriage, and Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury, did not approve of Margaret marrying a divorced man; opponents said that the marriage would threaten the monarchy as Edward VIII&#x27;s had. The &quot;Church of England Newspaper&quot; said that Margaret &quot;is a dutiful churchwoman who knows what strong views leaders of the church hold in this matter&quot;, but the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;—which had supported Edward and Wallis—asked, &quot;IF THEY WANT TO MARRY, WHY SHOULDN&#x27;T THEY?&quot;.

Churchill discussed the marriage at the 1953 Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference held with the coronation; the Statute of Westminster 1931 requires Dominion parliaments to also approve any Bill of Renunciation changing the line of succession. The Canadian government stated that altering the line twice in 25 years would harm the monarchy. Churchill informed the Queen that both his cabinet and Dominion prime ministers were against the marriage, and that Parliament would not approve a marriage that would be unrecognised by the Church of England unless Margaret renounced her rights to the throne.

Philip was reportedly the most opposed to Townsend in the royal family, while Margaret&#x27;s mother and sister wanted her to be happy but could not approve of the marriage. Besides Townsend&#x27;s divorce, two major problems were financial and constitutional. Margaret did not possess her sister&#x27;s large fortune and would need the £6,000 annual civil list allowance and £15,000 additional allowance Parliament had provided for her upon a suitable marriage. She did not object to being removed from the line of succession to the throne, as Elizabeth and all her children dying was unlikely, but receiving parliamentary approval for the marriage would be difficult and uncertain. At the age of 25 Margaret would not need the Queen&#x27;s permission under the 1772 Act; she could, after notifying the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, marry in one year if Parliament did not prevent her. Churchill told Elizabeth, however, that if one could easily leave the line of succession, another could easily enter the line, dangerous for a hereditary monarchy.

Elizabeth told the couple to wait until 1955, when Margaret would be 25, avoiding the Queen having to publicly disapprove of her sister&#x27;s marriage. Lascelles—who compared Townsend to Theudas &quot;boasting himself to be somebody&quot;—hoped that separating him and Margaret would end their romance. Churchill arranged for Townsend&#x27;s assignment as air attaché at the British Embassy in Brussels; he was sent on 15 July 1953, before Margaret&#x27;s return from Rhodesia on 30 July. The assignment was so sudden that the British ambassador learnt about it from a newspaper. Although Margaret and Townsend knew about his new job, they had reportedly been promised a few days together before his departure.

===Press coverage===
For two years, press speculation continued. In Brussels, Townsend only said that &quot;The word must come from somebody else&quot;. He avoided parties and being seen with women. With few duties (the sinecure was abolished after him), Townsend improved his French and horsemanship. He joined a Belgian show jumping club and rode in races around Europe. Margaret was told by the Church that she would be unable to receive communion if she married a divorced man. Three quarters of &quot;Sunday Express&quot; readers opposed the relationship, and Mass-Observation recorded criticism of the &quot;silly little fool&quot; as a poor example for young women who emulated her. Other newspaper polls showed popular support for Margaret&#x27;s personal choice, regardless of Church teaching or government. Ninety-seven per cent of &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; readers supported marriage, and a &quot;Daily Express&quot; editorial stated that even if the Archbishop of Canterbury was displeased, &quot;she would best please the vast majority of ordinary folk [by finding] happiness for herself&quot;.

The couple were not restricted on communicating by mail and telephone. Margaret worked with friends on charity productions of &quot;Lord and Lady Algy&quot; and &quot;The Frog&quot;, and publicly dated men such as Tennant and Wallace. In January 1955, she made the first of many trips to the Caribbean, perhaps to distract, and as a reward for being apart from Townsend. The attaché secretly travelled to Britain; while the palace was aware of one visit, he reportedly made other trips for nights and weekends with the princess at Clarence House—her apartment had its own front door—and friends&#x27; homes.
That spring Townsend for the first time spoke to the press: &quot;I am sick of being made to hide in my apartment like a thief&quot;, but whether he could marry &quot;involves more people than myself&quot;. He reportedly believed that his exile from Margaret would soon end, their love was strong, and that the British people would support marrying. Townsend received a bodyguard and police guard around his apartment after the Belgian government received threats on his life, but the British government still said nothing. Stating that people were more interested in the couple than the recent 1955 United Kingdom general election, on 29 May the &quot;Daily Express&quot; published an editorial demanding that Buckingham Palace confirm or deny the rumours.
The press described Margaret&#x27;s 25th birthday, 21 August 1955, as the day she was free to marry, and expected an announcement about Townsend soon. Three hundred journalists waited outside Balmoral, four times as many as those later following Diana, Princess of Wales. &quot;COME ON MARGARET!&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;″s front page said two days earlier, asking her to &quot;please make up your mind!&quot;. On 12 October Townsend returned from Brussels as Margaret&#x27;s suitor. The royal family devised a system in which it did not host Townsend, but he and Margaret formally courted each other at dinner parties hosted by friends such as Mark Bonham Carter. A Gallup poll found that 59% of Britons approved of their marrying, with 17% opposed. Women in the East End of London shouted &quot;Go on, Marg, do what you want&quot; at the princess. Although the couple was never seen together in public during this time, the general consensus was that they would marry. Crowds waited outside Clarence House, and a global audience read daily updates and rumours on newspaper front pages.

&quot;Nothing much else than Princess Margaret&#x27;s affairs is being talked of in this country&quot;, &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; said on 15 October. &quot;NOW – THE NATION WAITS&quot; was a typical headline. Observers interpreted Buckingham Palace&#x27;s request to the press to respect Margaret&#x27;s privacy—the first time the palace discussed the princess&#x27;s recent personal life—as evidence of an imminent betrothal announcement, probably before the Opening of Parliament on 25 October. As no announcement occurred—the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; on 17 October showed a photograph of Margaret&#x27;s left hand with the headline &quot;NO RING YET!&quot;—the press wondered why. Parliamentarians &quot;are frankly puzzled by the way the affair has been handled&quot;, the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; wrote. &quot;If a marriage is on, they ask, why not announce it quickly? If there is to be no marriage, why allow the couple to continue to meet without a clear denial of the rumours?&quot;

Why a betrothal did not occur is unclear. Margaret may have been uncertain of her desire, having written to Prime Minister Anthony Eden in August that &quot;It is only by seeing him in this way that I feel I can properly decide whether I can marry him or not&quot;. Margaret&#x27;s authorized biographer Christopher Warwick said that the letter was evidence that her love for Townsend was not as strong as the public believed, and that she wanted only the prime minister and Elizabeth to know of her uncertainty. Margaret may have told Townsend as early as 12 October that governmental and familial opposition to their marriage had not changed; it is possible that neither they nor Elizabeth fully understood until that year how difficult the 1772 Act made a royal marriage without the monarch&#x27;s permission. An influential 26 October editorial in &quot;The Times&quot; stating that &quot;The QUEEN&#x27;s sister married to a divorced man (even though the innocent party) would be irrevocably disqualified from playing her part in the essential royal function&quot; represented The Establishment&#x27;s view of what it considered a possibly dangerous crisis. It convinced many, who had believed that the media were exaggerating, that Margaret really might defy the Church and royal standards. Leslie Weatherhead, President of the Methodist Conference, now criticized the proposed marriage.

Townsend recalled that &quot;we felt mute and numbed at the centre of this maelstrom&quot;; Elizabeth also wanted the media circus to end. Townsend only had his RAF income and, other than a talent for writing, had no experience in other work. He wrote in his autobiography that Margaret &quot;could have married me only if she had been prepared to give up everything -- her position, her prestige, her privy purse. I simply hadn&#x27;t the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have lost&quot; for what Kenneth Rose described as &quot;life in a cottage on a Group Captain&#x27;s salary&quot;. Royal historian Hugo Vickers wrote that &quot;Lascelles&#x27;s separation plan had worked and the love between them had died&quot;. Warwick said that &quot;having spent two years apart, they were no longer as in love as they had been. Townsend was not the love of her life – the love of her life was her father, King George VI, whom she adored&quot;.

More than 100 journalists waited at Balmoral when Eden arrived to discuss the marriage with Elizabeth and Margaret on 1 October 1955. Lord Kilmuir, the Lord Chancellor, that month prepared a secret government document on the proposed marriage. According to a 1958 biography of Townsend by Norman Barrymaine and other accounts, Eden said that his government would oppose in Parliament Margaret retaining her royal status. Parliament might pass resolutions opposing the marriage, which the people would see as a disagreement between government and monarchy; Lord Salisbury, a High Anglican, might resign from the government rather than help pass a Bill of Renunciation. While the government could not prevent the marriage when Margaret became a private individual after a Bill of Renunciation, she would no longer be a Counsellor of State and would lose her civil list allowance; otherwise, taxpayers would subsidise a divorced man and his sons. The Church would consider any children from the marriage to be illegitimate. Eden recommended that, like her uncle Edward and his wife Wallis, Margaret and Townsend leave Britain for several years.

Papers released in 2004 to the National Archives disagree. They show that Elizabeth and Eden (who had been divorced and remarried himself) planned to amend the 1772 Act. Margaret would have been able to marry Townsend by removing her and any children from the marriage from the line of succession, and thus the Queen&#x27;s permission would no longer be necessary. Margaret would be allowed to keep her royal title and her allowance, stay in the country, and even continue with her public duties. Eden described Elizabeth&#x27;s attitude in a letter on the subject to the Commonwealth prime ministers as &quot;Her Majesty would not wish to stand in the way of her sister&#x27;s happiness&quot;. Eden himself was sympathetic; &quot;Exclusion from the Succession would not entail any other change in Princess Margaret&#x27;s position as a member of the Royal Family&quot;, he wrote.

On 28 October 1955 final draft of the plan, Margaret would announce that she would marry Townsend and leave the line of succession. As prearranged by Eden, the Queen would consult with the British and Commonwealth governments, and then ask them to amend the 1772 Act. Eden would have told Parliament that the Act was &quot;out of harmony with modern conditions&quot;. Kilmuir had advised Eden that the 1772 Act was flawed and might not apply to Margaret anyway. Kilmuir estimated that 75% of Britons would approve of allowing the marriage. The August letter to Eden is evidence, Warwick said, that Margaret was aware of the government&#x27;s intention to preserve her title and allowance.

The decision not to marry was made on the 24th and for the following week, Margaret worked on the wording of her statement, which was released on the 31st. It is unclear what or when she was told about the government proposal, drafted on the 28th. By the early 1980s she was still protesting to biographers that the couple had been given false hope marriage was possible and she would have ended the relationship sooner had she been informed otherwise.

The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; on 28 October discussed &quot;The Times&quot;″s editorial with the headline &quot;THIS CRUEL PLAN MUST BE EXPOSED&quot;. Although Margaret and Townsend had read the editorial the newspaper denounced as from &quot;a dusty world and a forgotten age&quot;, they had earlier made their decision and written an announcement.

===End of relationship===
On 31 October 1955, Margaret issued a statement:

&quot;Thoroughly drained, thoroughly demoralized&quot;, Margaret later said, she and Townsend wrote the statement together. She refused when Oliver Dawnay, the Queen Mother&#x27;s private secretary, asked to remove the word &quot;devotion&quot;. The written statement, signed &quot;Margaret&quot;, was the first official confirmation of the relationship. Some Britons were disbelieving or angry while others, including clergy, were proud of Margaret for choosing duty and faith; newspapers were evenly divided on the decision. Mass-Observation recorded indifference or criticism of the couple among men, but great interest among women, whether for or against. Kenneth Tynan, John Minton, Ronald Searle, and others signed an open letter from &quot;the younger generation&quot;. Published in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; on 4 November, the letter said that the end of the relationship had exposed The Establishment and &quot;our national hypocrisy&quot;.

Townsend recalled that &quot;We had reached the end of the road, our feelings for one another were unchanged, but they had incurred for us a burden so great that we decided together to lay it down&quot;. The Associated Press said that Margaret&#x27;s statement was almost &quot;a rededication of her life to the duties of royalty, making unlikely any marriage for her in the near future&quot;; the princess may have expected to never marry after the long relationship ended, because most of her eligible male friends were no longer bachelors. Barrymaine agreed that Margaret intended the statement to mean that she would never marry, but wrote that Townsend likely did not accept any such vow to him by the princess, and his subsequent departure from Britain for two years was to not interfere with her life. &quot;We both had a feeling of unimaginable relief. We were liberated at last from this monstrous problem&quot;, Townsend said.

After resigning from the RAF and travelling around the world for 18 months Townsend returned in March 1958; he and Margaret met several times, but could not avoid the press (&quot;TOGETHER AGAIN&quot;) or royal disapproval. Townsend again left Britain to write a book about his trip; Barrymaine concluded in 1958 that &quot;none of the fundamental obstacles to their marriage has been overcome – or shows any prospects of being overcome&quot;. Townsend said during a 1970 book tour that he and Margaret did not correspond and they had not seen each other since a &quot;friendly&quot; 1958 meeting, &quot;just like I think a lot of people never see their old girl friends&quot;. Their love letters are in the Royal Archives and will not be available to the public until 100 years after Margaret&#x27;s birth, February 2030. These are unlikely to include Margaret&#x27;s letters. In 1959, she wrote to Townsend in response to him informing her of his remarriage plans, accusing him of betraying their vow not to marry anyone else and requesting her love letters to him be destroyed. He claimed he complied with her wishes, but kept this letter and an envelope of burned shards of the vow she had sent, eventually destroying these also. He was apparently unaware Margaret had already broken the pact by her engagement to Billy Wallace as it was not revealed until many years later.

In October 1993, a friend of Margaret revealed she had met Townsend for what turned out to be the last time before his death in 1995. She had not wanted to attend the reunion they&#x27;d both been invited to, in 1992, for fear it might be picked up by the press, so she asked to see him privately instead. Margaret said that he looked &quot;exactly the same, except he had grey hair&quot;. Guests said he had not really changed, and that they just sat chatting like old friends. They also found him disgruntled and had convinced himself that in agreeing to part, he and Margaret had set a noble example which seemed to have been in vain.

Billy Wallace later said that &quot;The thing with Townsend was a girlish nonsense that got out of hand. It was never the big thing on her part that people claim&quot;.

==Marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones==
Margaret accepted one of Wallace&#x27;s many proposals to marry in 1956, but the engagement ended before an official announcement when he admitted to a romance in the Bahamas; &quot;I had my chance and blew it with my big mouth&quot;, Wallace said. Margaret did not reveal this publicly until an interview and subsequent biography with Nigel Dempster in 1977.

Margaret met the photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones at a supper party in 1958. They became engaged in October 1959. Armstrong-Jones proposed to Margaret with a ruby engagement ring surrounded by diamonds in the shape of a rosebud. She reportedly accepted his proposal a day after learning from Townsend that he intended to marry a young Belgian woman, Marie-Luce Jamagne, who was half his age and greatly resembled Margaret. Margaret&#x27;s announcement of her engagement, on 26 February 1960, surprised the press, as she had concealed the romance from reporters.

Margaret married Armstrong-Jones at Westminster Abbey on 6 May 1960. The ceremony was the first royal wedding to be broadcast on television, and it attracted viewing figures of 300 million worldwide. 2,000 guests were invited for the wedding ceremony. Margaret&#x27;s wedding dress was designed by Norman Hartnell and worn with the Poltimore tiara. She had eight young bridesmaids, led by her niece, Princess Anne. The Duke of Edinburgh escorted the bride, and the best man was Dr Roger Gilliatt. Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher conducted the marriage service. Following the ceremony, the couple made the traditional appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. The honeymoon was a six-week Caribbean cruise aboard the royal yacht &quot;Britannia&quot;. As a wedding present, Colin Tennant gave her a plot of land on his private Caribbean island, Mustique. The newlyweds moved into rooms in Kensington Palace.

In 1961, Margaret&#x27;s husband was created Earl of Snowdon. The couple had two children (both born by Caesarean section at Margaret&#x27;s request): David, born 3 November 1961, and Sarah, born 1 May 1964. The marriage widened Margaret&#x27;s social circle beyond the court and aristocracy to include show business celebrities and bohemians. At the time, it was thought to reflect the breaking down of British class barriers. The Snowdons experimented with the styles and fashions of the 1960s.

===Separation and divorce===
Both parties in the marriage regularly engaged in extramarital relationships. Lord Snowdon had a series of affairs, including with long-term mistress, Ann Hills, and Lady Jacqueline Rufus-Isaacs, daughter of the 3rd Marquess of Reading. Anne De Courcy&#x27;s 2008 biography summarises the situation with a quote from a close friend: &quot;If it moves, he&#x27;ll have it.&quot;

Reportedly, Margaret had her first extramarital affair in 1966, with her daughter&#x27;s godfather Anthony Barton, a Bordeaux wine producer. A year later she had a one-month liaison with Robin Douglas-Home, a nephew of former British prime minister Alec Douglas-Home. Margaret claimed that her relationship with Douglas-Home was platonic, but her letters to him (which were later sold) were intimate. Douglas-Home, who suffered from depression, died by suicide 18 months after the split with Margaret. Claims that she was romantically involved with musician Mick Jagger, actor Peter Sellers, and Australian cricketer Keith Miller are unproven. According to biographer Charlotte Breese, entertainer Leslie Hutchinson had a &quot;brief liaison&quot; with Margaret in 1955. A 2009 biography of actor David Niven included assertions, based on information from Niven&#x27;s widow and a good friend of Niven&#x27;s, that he had had an affair with Margaret, who was 20 years his junior. In 1975, Margaret was listed among women with whom actor Warren Beatty had had romantic relationships. John Bindon, an actor from Fulham, who had spent time in prison, sold his story to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, boasting of a close relationship with Margaret.
Beyond extramarital relationships, the marriage was accompanied by drugs, alcohol, and bizarre behaviour by both parties, such as Snowdon&#x27;s leaving lists of &quot;things I hate about you&quot; for Margaret to find between the pages of books she read. According to biographer Sarah Bradford, one note read: &quot;You look like a Jewish manicurist and I hate you&quot;.

By the early 1970s, the couple had drifted apart. In September 1973, Colin Tennant introduced Margaret to Roddy Llewellyn. Llewellyn was 17 years her junior. In 1974, she invited him as a guest to &quot;Les Jolies Eaux&quot;, the holiday home she had built on Mustique. It was the first of several visits. Margaret described their relationship as &quot;a loving friendship&quot;. Once, when Llewellyn left on an impulsive trip to Turkey, Margaret became emotionally distraught and took an overdose of sleeping tablets. &quot;I was so exhausted because of everything&quot;, she later said, &quot;that all I wanted to do was sleep&quot;. As she recovered, her ladies-in-waiting kept Snowdon away from her, afraid that seeing him would distress her further.

In February 1976, a picture of Margaret and Llewellyn in swimsuits on Mustique was published on the front page of a tabloid, the &quot;News of the World&quot;. The press portrayed Margaret as a predatory older woman and Llewellyn as her toyboy lover. On 19 March 1976, Margaret and Snowdon publicly acknowledged that their marriage had irretrievably broken down and that they had decided to separate. Some politicians suggested removing Margaret from the civil list. Labour MPs denounced her as &quot;a royal parasite&quot; and a &quot;floosie&quot;. On 24 May 1978, the decree nisi for the couple&#x27;s divorce was granted. In the same month, Margaret was taken ill, and diagnosed as suffering from gastroenteritis and alcoholic hepatitis, although Warwick denied that she was ever an alcoholic. On 11 July 1978, the divorce was finalised. It was the first divorce of a senior member of the British royal family since that of Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh in 1901. Allegedly, Margaret did not want a divorce: she tried to make her marriage succeed, but there were &quot;too many challenges&quot;. Devastated by the divorce, Margaret never remarried. On 15 December 1978, Snowdon married Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, but he and Margaret remained close friends.

In 1981, Llewellyn married Tatiana Soskin, whom he had known for 10 years. Margaret remained close friends with them both.

==Public life==
Among Margaret&#x27;s first official engagements was launching the ocean liner &quot;Edinburgh Castle&quot; in Belfast in 1947. Subsequently, Margaret went on multiple tours of various places; in her first major tour she joined her parents and sister for a tour of South Africa in 1947. Her tour aboard &quot;Britannia&quot; to the British colonies in the Caribbean in 1955 created a sensation throughout the West Indies, and calypsos were dedicated to her. As colonies of the British Commonwealth of Nations sought nationhood, Margaret represented the Crown at independence ceremonies in Jamaica in 1962 and Tuvalu and Dominica in 1978. Her visit to Tuvalu was cut short by an illness, which may have been viral pneumonia, and she was flown to Australia to recuperate. Other overseas tours included East Africa and Mauritius in 1956, the United States in 1965, Japan in 1969 and 1979, the United States and Canada in 1974, Australia in 1975, the Philippines in 1980, Swaziland in 1981, and China in 1987.

In August 1979, Margaret&#x27;s cousin Lord Mountbatten and members of his family were killed by a bomb planted by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. That October, while on a fundraising tour of the United States on behalf of the Royal Opera House, Margaret was seated at a dinner reception in Chicago with columnist Abra Anderson and Mayor Jane Byrne. Margaret told them that the royal family had been moved by the many letters of condolence from Ireland. The following day, Anderson&#x27;s rival Irv Kupcinet published a claim that Margaret had referred to the Irish as &quot;pigs&quot;. Margaret, Anderson, and Byrne all issued immediate denials, but the damage was already done. The rest of the tour drew demonstrations, and Margaret&#x27;s security was doubled in the face of physical threats.

=== Charity work ===

Margaret&#x27;s main interests were welfare charities, music and ballet. She was president of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), the Royal Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (Children 1st), and Invalid Children&#x27;s Aid Nationwide (also called &#x27;I CAN&#x27;). She was also Grand President of the St John Ambulance Brigade. Margaret was president or patron of numerous organisations, such as the West Indies Olympic Association, the Girl Guides, Northern Ballet Theatre, Birmingham Royal Ballet, Scottish Ballet, Tenovus Cancer Care, the Royal College of Nursing, and the London Lighthouse (an AIDS charity that has since merged with the Terrence Higgins Trust). In her capacity as president of the Royal Ballet, she played a key role in launching a fund for Dame Margot Fonteyn, who was experiencing financial troubles. With the help of the Children&#x27;s Royal Variety Performance, she also organised yearly fundraisers for NSPCC. At some points Margaret was criticized for not being as active as other members of the royal family.

==Illness and death==

Margaret&#x27;s later life was marred by illness and disability. She began smoking cigarettes in her late teens and had continued to smoke heavily for many years thereafter. In the 1970s, she suffered a nervous breakdown and was treated for depression by a psychiatrist from the Priory Clinic. Later on, she suffered from migraines, laryngitis, and bronchitis. In January 1980, she was operated on at the London Clinic to remove a benign skin lesion. On 5 January 1985, she had part of her left lung removed; the operation drew parallels with that of her father 34 years earlier. She quit smoking in 1991 or January 1993, although servants still claimed they smelt cigarette smoke in her apartment and she continued to drink heavily.

In January 1993, Margaret was admitted to hospital for pneumonia. She experienced a mild stroke on 23 February 1998 at her holiday home in Mustique. Early the following year, she suffered severe scalds to her feet in a bathroom accident, which affected her mobility in that she required support when walking and sometimes used a wheelchair. She was hospitalized on 10 January 2001, due to loss of appetite and swallowing problems after a further stroke. By March 2001, strokes had left her with partial vision and paralysis on the left side. Margaret&#x27;s last public appearances were at the 101st birthday celebrations of her mother in August 2001, and the 100th birthday celebration of her aunt Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, that December.

Margaret died in her sleep at King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital, London, at 06:30 GMT on 9 February 2002, aged 71, three days after the 50th anniversary of her father&#x27;s death. She was 11th in line to the throne at the time of her death. The previous day, she had suffered another stroke that was followed by cardiac problems. Prince Charles paid tribute to his aunt in a television broadcast. UK politicians and foreign leaders sent their condolences as well. Following her death, private memorial services were held at St Mary Magdalene Church and Glamis Castle.

Margaret&#x27;s coffin, draped in her personal standard, was taken from Kensington Palace to St James&#x27;s Palace before her funeral. Her funeral was held on 15 February 2002, the 50th anniversary of her father&#x27;s funeral. In line with her wishes, the ceremony was a private service at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, for family and friends. Unlike most other members of the royal family, she was cremated, at Slough Crematorium. Her lady-in-waiting, Lady Glenconner, stated that Margaret found the Royal Burial Ground at Frogmore &quot;very gloomy&quot; and would have wanted to be where her father was buried. Margaret&#x27;s ashes were temporarily placed in the Royal Vault of St George&#x27;s Chapel. The Queen Mother died seven weeks after Margaret, and Margaret&#x27;s ashes were moved to the King George VI Memorial Chapel in St George&#x27;s following her mother&#x27;s funeral. A state memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on 19 April 2002. Another memorial service to mark the 10th anniversary of their deaths was held on 30 March 2012 at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, which was attended by Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family.

==Legacy==
===Image===
Observers often characterized Margaret as a spoiled snob capable of cutting remarks and hauteur. Critics claimed that she even looked down on her grandmother Queen Mary because Mary was born a princess with the lower &quot;Serene Highness&quot; style, whereas Margaret was a &quot;Royal Highness&quot; by birth. Their letters, however, provide no indication of friction between them.

Margaret could also be charming and informal. People who came into contact with her could be perplexed by her swings between frivolity and formality. Marion Crawford wrote in her memoir: &quot;Impulsive and bright remarks she made became headlines and, taken out of their context, began to produce in the public eye an oddly distorted personality that bore little resemblance to the Margaret we knew.&quot;

Margaret&#x27;s acquaintance Gore Vidal, the American writer, wrote: &quot;She was far too intelligent for her station in life&quot;. He recalled a conversation with Margaret in which, discussing her public notoriety, she said: &quot;It was inevitable, when there are two sisters and one is the Queen, who must be the source of honour and all that is good, while the other must be the focus of the most creative malice, the evil sister&quot;.
As a child, Margaret enjoyed pony shows, but unlike other family members she did not express interest in hunting, shooting, and fishing in adulthood. She became interested in ballet from a very young age and enjoyed participating in amateur plays. She directed one such play, titled &quot;The Frogs&quot;, with her aristocratic friends as cast members. Actors and film stars were among the regular visitors to her residence at Kensington Palace. In January 1981, she was the guest for an episode of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Her musical choices included &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; by Tennessee Ernie Ford which she said had entertained her in a traffic jam. Her favourite was Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. In 1984, she appeared as herself in an episode of the radio drama &quot;The Archers&quot;, becoming the first member of the royal family to take part in a BBC drama.

Margaret&#x27;s private life was for many years the subject of intense speculation by media and royalty watchers. Her house on Mustique, designed by her husband&#x27;s uncle Oliver Messel, a stage designer, was her favourite holiday destination. Allegations of wild parties and drug taking also surfaced in the media.

Margaret was a &quot;devout&quot; Christian her whole life, though &quot;she had desires that often conflicted with her faith&quot;. At one point, she considered becoming Roman Catholic.

Following Margaret&#x27;s death, her lady-in-waiting, Lady Glenconner, said that &quot;[Margaret] was devoted to the Queen and tremendously supportive of her&quot;. Margaret was described by her cousin Lady Elizabeth Shakerley as &quot;somebody who had a wonderful capacity for giving a lot of people pleasure and she was making a very, very, very good and loyal friend&quot;. Another cousin, Lord Lichfield, said that &quot;[Margaret] was pretty sad towards the end of her life because it was a life unfulfilled&quot;.

&quot;The Independent&quot; wrote in Townsend&#x27;s 1995 obituary that &quot;The immense display of popular sentiment and interest [in the relationship] can now be seen to have constituted a watershed in the nation&#x27;s attitude towards divorce&quot;. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Church received much of the popular anger toward the end of the relationship. Randolph Churchill believed that rumours &quot;that Fisher had intervened to prevent the Princess from marrying Townsend has done incalculable harm to the Church of England&quot;; a Gallup poll found that 28% agreed, and 59% disagreed, with the Church&#x27;s refusal to remarry a divorced person while the other spouse was alive. Biographer Warwick suggests that Margaret&#x27;s most enduring legacy is an accidental one. Perhaps unwittingly, Margaret paved the way for public acceptance of royal divorce. Her life, if not her actions, made the decisions and choices of her sister&#x27;s children, three of whom divorced, easier than they otherwise would have been.

Eden reportedly told Elizabeth in Balmoral when discussing Margaret and Townsend that, regardless of outcome, the monarchy would be damaged. In 1995, Harold Brooks-Baker was quoted in Townsend&#x27;s obituary: &quot;In my opinion, this was the turning point to disaster for the royal family. After Princess Margaret was denied marriage, it backfired and more or less ruined Margaret&#x27;s life. The Queen decided that from then on, anyone someone in her family wanted to marry would be more or less acceptable. The royal family and the public now feel that they&#x27;ve gone too far in the other direction&quot;.

===Fashion and style===

During her lifetime, Margaret was considered a fashion icon. Her fashion earned the nickname &#x27;The Margaret Look&#x27;. The princess, dubbed a &#x27;royal rebel&#x27;, styled herself in contrast to her sister&#x27;s prim and timeless style, adopting trendy mod accessories, such as brightly coloured headscarves and glamorous sunglasses. Margaret developed a close relationship with atelier Christian Dior, wearing his designs throughout her life and becoming one of his most prominent customers. In 1950, he designed a cream gown worn for her 21st birthday, which has been cited as an iconic part of fashion history. Throughout the decade, Margaret was known for wearing floral-print dresses, bold-hued ballgowns and luxurious fabrics, accessorising with diamonds, pearls, and fur stoles. &quot;British Vogue&quot; wrote that Margaret&#x27;s style &#x27;hit her stride&#x27; in the mid-60s, where she was photographed alongside celebrities like The Beatles, Frank Sinatra and Sophia Loren. Margaret was also known for her &quot;magnificent&quot; hats and headdresses, including a canary feather hat worn on a 1962 Jamaica visit and a peacock feather pillbox hat to the 1973 Royal Ascot. &quot;Marie Claire&quot; stated that the princess &quot;refused to compromise&quot; on her style later in life, continuing with trends of big sleeves and strapless evening gowns.

In April 2007, an exhibition titled &quot;Princess Line – The Fashion Legacy of Princess Margaret&quot; opened at Kensington Palace, showcasing contemporary fashion from British designers such as Vivienne Westwood inspired by Margaret&#x27;s legacy of style. Christopher Bailey&#x27;s Spring 2006 collection for Burberry was inspired by Margaret&#x27;s look from the 1960s.

===Finances===
In her lifetime, Margaret&#x27;s fortune was estimated to be around £20 million, with most of it being inherited from her father. She also inherited pieces of art and antiques from Queen Mary, and Dame Margaret Greville left her £20,000 in 1943. In 1999, her son, Lord Linley, sold his mother&#x27;s Caribbean residence Les Jolies Eaux for a reported £2.4 million. At the time of her death Margaret received £219,000 from the civil list. Following her death, she left a £7.6 million estate to her two children, which was cut down to £4.5 million after inheritance tax. In June 2006, much of Margaret&#x27;s estate was auctioned by Christie&#x27;s to meet the tax and, in her son&#x27;s words, &quot;normal family requirements such as educating her grandchildren&quot;, though some of the items were sold in aid of charities such as the Stroke Association. Reportedly, Elizabeth had made it clear that the proceeds from any item that was given to her sister in an official capacity must be donated to charities. A world record price of £1.24 million was set by a Fabergé clock. The Poltimore Tiara, which she wore for her wedding in 1960, sold for £926,400. The sale of her effects totalled £13,658,000.

===In popular culture===
Actresses who have portrayed Margaret include Lucy Cohu (&quot;The Queen&#x27;s Sister&quot;, 2005), Katie McGrath (&quot;The Queen&quot;, 2009), Ramona Marquez (&quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;, 2010), Bel Powley (&quot;A Royal Night Out&quot;, 2015), Olivia Benjamin (&quot;Father Brown&quot;, 2023), and Vanessa Kirby, Helena Bonham Carter, and Lesley Manville, who all played different stages of Margaret&#x27;s life during &quot;The Crown&quot;, 2016–2023. The young Princess Margaret was played by Beau Gadsdon. The 2008 heist film, &quot;The Bank Job&quot;, revolves around alleged photos of Margaret. A character, &quot;Pantomime Princess Margaret&quot;, made regular appearances in the BBC&#x27;s 1970s comedy show &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

<doc id="38571" wikidata="Q15277" url="?curid=38571" title="Adenine">
<text>Adenine (, ) (symbol A or Ade) is a purine nucleotide base. It is one of the nucleobases in the nucleic acids, DNA and RNA. The shape of adenine is complementary to either thymine in DNA or uracil in RNA. In cells adenine, as an independent molecule, is rare. It is almost always covalently bound to become a part of a larger biomolecule.

Adenine has a central role in cellular respiration. It is part of adenosine triphosphate which provides the energy that drives and supports most activities in living cells, such as protein synthesis, chemical synthesis, muscle contraction, and nerve impulse propagation. In respiration it also participates as part of the cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and Coenzyme A. 

It is also part of adenosine, adenosine monophosphate, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and S-adenosylmethionine.

== Structure ==

Adenine forms several tautomers, compounds that can be rapidly interconverted and are often considered equivalent. However, in isolated conditions, i.e. in an inert gas matrix and in the gas phase, mainly the 9H-adenine tautomer is found.

== Biosynthesis ==
Purine metabolism involves the formation of adenine and guanine. Both adenine and guanine are derived from the nucleotide inosine monophosphate (IMP), which in turn is synthesized from a pre-existing ribose phosphate through a complex pathway using atoms from the amino acids glycine, glutamine, and aspartic acid, as well as the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate.

== Manufacturing method ==
Patented August 20, 1968, the current recognized method of industrial-scale production of adenine is a modified form of the formamide method. This method heats up formamide under 120 degree Celsius conditions within a sealed flask for 5 hours to form adenine. The reaction is heavily increased in quantity by using a phosphorus oxychloride (phosphoryl chloride) or phosphorus pentachloride as an acid catalyst and sunlight or ultraviolet conditions. After the 5 hours have passed and the formamide-phosphorus oxychloride-adenine solution cools down, water is put into the flask containing the formamide and now-formed adenine. The water-formamide-adenine solution is then poured through a filtering column of activated charcoal. The water and formamide molecules, being small molecules, will pass through the charcoal and into the waste flask; the large adenine molecules, however, will attach or &quot;adsorb&quot; to the charcoal due to the van der Waals forces that interact between the adenine and the carbon in the charcoal. Because charcoal has a large surface area, it is able to capture the majority of molecules that pass a certain size (greater than water and formamide) through it. To extract the adenine from the charcoal-adsorbed adenine, ammonia gas dissolved in water (aqua ammonia) is poured onto the activated charcoal-adenine structure to liberate the adenine into the ammonia-water solution. The solution containing water, ammonia, and adenine is then left to air dry, with the adenine losing solubility due to the loss of ammonia gas that previously made the solution basic and capable of dissolving adenine, thus causing it to crystallize into a pure white powder that can be stored.

== Function ==
Adenine is one of the two purine nucleobases (the other being guanine) used in forming nucleotides of the nucleic acids. In DNA, adenine binds to thymine via two hydrogen bonds to assist in stabilizing the nucleic acid structures. In RNA, which is used for protein synthesis, adenine binds to uracil.

Adenine forms adenosine, a nucleoside, when attached to ribose, and deoxyadenosine when attached to deoxyribose. It forms adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a nucleoside triphosphate, when three phosphate groups are added to adenosine. Adenosine triphosphate is used in cellular metabolism as one of the basic methods of transferring chemical energy between chemical reactions. ATP is thus a derivative of adenine, adenosine, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and adenosine diphosphate.

== History ==

In older literature, adenine was sometimes called Vitamin B4. Due to it being synthesized by the body and not essential to be obtained by diet, it does not meet the definition of vitamin and is no longer part of the Vitamin B complex. However, two B vitamins, niacin and riboflavin, bind with adenine to form the essential cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), respectively. Hermann Emil Fischer was one of the early scientists to study adenine.

It was named in 1885 by Albrecht Kossel after Greek &quot;ἀδήν&quot; aden &quot;gland&quot;, in reference to the pancreas, from which Kossel&#x27;s sample had been extracted.

Experiments performed in 1961 by Joan Oró have shown that a large quantity of adenine can be synthesized from the polymerization of ammonia with five hydrogen cyanide (HCN) molecules in aqueous solution; whether this has implications for the origin of life on Earth is under debate.

On August 8, 2011, a report, based on NASA studies with meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting building blocks of DNA and RNA (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules) may have been formed extraterrestrially in outer space. In 2011, physicists reported that adenine has an &quot;unexpectedly variable range of ionization energies along its reaction pathways&quot; which suggested that &quot;understanding experimental data on how adenine survives exposure to UV light is much more complicated than previously thought&quot;; these findings have implications for spectroscopic measurements of heterocyclic compounds, according to one report.

<text>Year 1158 ([[Roman numerals|MCLVIII]]) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Autumn – Emperor Manuel I Komnenos sets out from Constantinople at the head of an expeditionary army. He marches to Cilicia; and while the main army follows the coast road eastwards Manuel hurries ahead with a force of only 500 cavalry. He manages to surprise Thoros II &quot;the Great&quot;, lord of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, who participated in the attack on Cyprus in 1156. Thoros flees into the mountains and Cilicia is occupied by the Byzantines.

==== Europe ====
* January 11 – Vladislav II becomes king of Bohemia. He is crowned by Frederick Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor, with a diadem (called by the chroniclers a &quot;diadema&quot; or &quot;circulus&quot;). Vladislaus is also invested with Upper Lusatia, and accompanies Frederick to Milan to suppress the rebellion in Lombardy (northern Italy).
* The Diet of Roncaglia is convoked by Frederick I. He mobilises an army of 100,000 men and leaves in June for a second Italian expedition – accompanied by Henry the Lion and his Saxon forces. He crosses the Alps and lays siege to Milan. German forces capture the city from the rebels after a short siege. However Milan soon rebels again, with Empress Beatrice taken captive and forced into parading on a donkey.
* Summer – King Henry II of England travels to France to meet King Louis VII and propose a marriage between his three-year-old son Henry and Louis&#x27; daughter Margaret (less than a year old). She is shipped to England, as the future wife and queen. The Vexin region is promised to Margaret as dowry and is put under the care of the Knights Templar, until her future husband is old enough to take control of it.
* August 31 – King Sancho III (&quot;the Desired&quot;) dies after a 1-year reign. He is succeeded as ruler of Castile by his 2-year-old son Alfonso VIII (&quot;the Noble&quot;). The noble houses of Lara and Castro claim the regency, as the boy&#x27;s uncle, Ferdinand II (ruler of León and Galicia).
* Raymond of Fitero, Spanish monk and abbot, pledges to defend the fortress of Calatrava (guarding the roads to Córdoba and Toledo) from incoming Muslim raiders. It is the founding moment of the Order of Calatrava, the spearhead of the Iberian armies during the Reconquista.
* Portuguese forces, led by King Afonso I of Portugal (&quot;the Great&quot;), conquer Pamela, Alcácer do Sal and Sesimbra from the diminished Almoravids.
* 12-year-old William Marshal is sent from England to the Château de Tancarville in Normandy to be brought up in the household of William de Tancarville, a cousin of William&#x27;s mother. He begins his training as a knight; this also includes academic studies, practical lessons in chivalry and courtly life, and warfare and combat (using wooden swords and spears).
* Welsh forces under Ifor Bach (&quot;Ivor the Short&quot;) attack Cardiff Castle and kidnap William Fitz Robert, Norman lord of Glamorgan, along with his family.

==== Asia ====
* September 5 – Emperor Go-Shirakawa of Japan abdicates the throne after a 3-year reign. He is succeeded by his 15-year-old son Nijō as the 77th emperor. Go-Shirakawa retains power, and gives Kiyomori Taira a higher position to lead a samurai-dominated government.

=== By topic ===

==== Economy ====
* To restore confidence in the English currency, Henry II mints a new penny (known to specialists as the Tealby penny) with his own image.

<doc id="38577" wikidata="Q168225" url="?curid=38577" title="Hebron">
<text>Hebron (; , or ; , ) is a Palestinian city in the southern West Bank, south of Jerusalem. Hebron is capital of the West Bank&#x27;s largest governorate, known as Hebron Governorate. With a population of 201,063 in the city limits, the adjacent metropolitan area within the governorate is home to over 700,000 people. Hebron spans across an area of . It is the third largest city in the country, followed by Gaza and Jerusalem. The city is often considered one of the four holy cities in Judaism as well as in Islam and Christianity.

It is considered one of the oldest cities in the Levant. According to the Bible, Abraham settled in Hebron and bought the Cave of the Patriarchs as burial place for his wife Sarah. Biblical tradition holds that the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, were buried in the cave. The city is also recognized in the Bible as the place where David was anointed king of Israel. Following the Babylonian captivity, the Edomites settled in Hebron. During the first century BCE, Herod the Great built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs, which later became a church, and then a mosque. With the exception of a brief Crusader control, successive Muslim dynasties ruled Hebron from the 6th century CE until the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s dissolution following World War I, when the city became part of British Mandatory Palestine.

The 1929 riots and the Arab uprising of 1936–39 led the British government to evacuate the Jewish community from Hebron. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Hebron, occupied and annexed by Jordan, and since the 1967 Six-Day War, the city has been under Israeli military occupation. Following Israeli occupation, Jewish presence was restored in the city. Since the 1997 Hebron Protocol, most of Hebron has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority. The city is often described as a &quot;microcosm&quot; of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The 1997 protocol divided the city into two sectors—H1 Hebron, controlled by the Palestinian National Authority, and H2 Hebron, managed by Israeli authorities. All security arrangements and travel permits for local residents are coordinated between the Palestinian Authority and Israel via the COGAT. The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.

The largest city in the southern West Bank, Hebron is chief commercial and industrial center in the region. It is a busy hub of trade, generating roughly a third of the area&#x27;s GDP, largely due to the sale of limestone from quarries in its area. Hebron has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, ceramics, plastics, pottery workshops, metalworking and glassblowing industry. The city is home to numerous shopping malls. The Old City of Hebron features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old bazaars. It is recognized as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. Hebron is also known as a regional educational and medical hub.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Hebron&quot; appears to trace back to two northwest Semitic languages, which coalesce in the form &quot;ḥbr&quot;, having reflexes in Hebrew and Amorite, with a basic sense of &#x27;unite&#x27; and connoting a range of meanings from &quot;colleague&quot; to &quot;friend&quot;. In the proper name &quot;Hebron&quot;, the original sense may have been &quot;alliance&quot;.

The Arabic name for Hebron, &quot;al-Khalīl&quot;, emerged as the city&#x27;s actual name in the 13th century. Earlier Muslim sources refer to the city as Ḥabra or Ḥabrūn. The name &quot;al-Khalīl&quot; derives from the Qur&#x27;anic epithet for Abraham, &quot;Khalil al-Rahman&quot; () &quot;Beloved of the Merciful&quot; or &quot;Friend of God&quot;. Arabic &quot;Al-Khalil&quot; thus precisely translates the ancient Hebrew toponym &quot;Ḥebron&quot;, understood as &quot;ḥaḇer&quot; (friend). 

== History ==
===Bronze and Iron Age===
Archaeological excavations reveal traces of strong fortifications dated to the Early Bronze Age, covering some 24–30 dunams centered around Tel Rumeida. The city flourished in the 17th–18th centuries BCE before being destroyed by fire, and was resettled in the late Middle Bronze Age. This older Hebron was originally a Canaanite royal city. Abrahamic legend associates the city with the Hittites. It has been conjectured that Hebron might have been the capital of Shuwardata of Gath, an Indo-European contemporary of Jerusalem&#x27;s regent, Abdi-Ḫeba, although the Hebron hills were almost devoid of settlements in the Late Bronze Age. The Abrahamic traditions associated with Hebron are nomadic. This may also reflect a Kenite element, since the nomadic Kenites are said to have long occupied the city, and &quot;Heber&quot; is the name for a Kenite clan. In the narrative of the later Hebrew conquest, Hebron was one of two centres under Canaanite control. They were ruled by the three sons of Anak (&quot;benê/yelîdê hāʿănaq&quot;). or may reflect some Kenite and Kenizzite migration from the Negev to Hebron, since terms related to the Kenizzites appear to be close to Hurrian. This suggests that behind the Anakim legend lies some early Hurrian population. In Biblical lore they are represented as descendants of the Nephilim. The Book of Genesis mentions that it was formerly called Kirjath-arba, or &quot;city of four&quot;, possibly referring to the four pairs or couples who were buried there, or four tribes, or four quarters, four hills, or a confederated settlement of four families.

The story of Abraham&#x27;s purchase of the Cave of the Patriarchs from the Hittites constitutes a seminal element in what was to become the Jewish attachment to the land in that it signified the first &quot;real estate&quot; of Israel long before the conquest under Joshua. In settling here, Abraham is described as making his first , an alliance with two local Amorite clans who became his &quot;ba&#x27;alei brit&quot; or &quot;masters of the covenant&quot;.
The Hebron of the Israelites was centered on what is now known as Tel Rumeida, while its ritual centre was located at Elonei Mamre. Hebrew Bible narrative also describes the city. 

It is said to have been wrested from the Canaanites by either Joshua, who is said to have wiped out all of its previous inhabitants, &quot;destroying everything that drew breath, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded&quot;, or the Tribe of Judah as a whole, or specifically Caleb the Judahite. The town itself, with some contiguous pasture land, is then said to have been granted to the Levites of the clan of Kohath, while the fields of the city, as well as its surrounding villages were assigned to Caleb (), who expels the three giants, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, who ruled the city. Later, the biblical narrative has King David called by God to relocate to Hebron and reign from there for some seven years (). It is there that the elders of Israel come to him to make a covenant before Elohim and anoint him king of Israel. It was in Hebron again that Absalom has himself declared king and then raises a revolt against his father David (). It became one of the principal centers of the Tribe of Judah and was classified as one of the six traditional Cities of Refuge.

As is shown by the discovery at Lachish, the second most important city in the Kingdom of Judah after Jerusalem, of seals with the inscription &quot;lmlk Hebron&quot; (to the king Hebron), Hebron continued to constitute an important local economic centre, given its strategic position on the crossroads between the Dead Sea to the east, Jerusalem to the north, the Negev and Egypt to the south, and the Shepelah and the coastal plain to the west. Lying along trading routes, it remained administratively and politically dependent on Jerusalem for this period.

===Classic antiquity===
After the destruction of the First Temple, most of the Jewish inhabitants of Hebron were exiled, and according to the conventional view, some researchers found traces of Edomite presence after the 5th–4th centuries BCE, as the area became Achaemenid province, and, in the wake of Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest, Hebron was throughout the Hellenistic period under the influence of Idumea (as the new area inhabited by the Edomites was called during the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman periods), as is attested by inscriptions for that period bearing names with the Edomite God Qōs. Jews also appear to have lived there after the return from the Babylonian exile (). During the Maccabean revolt, Hebron was burnt and plundered by Judah Maccabee who fought against the Edomites in 167 BCE. The city appears to have long resisted Hasmonean dominance, however, and indeed as late as the First Jewish–Roman War was still considered Idumean.

The present day city of Hebron was settled in the valley downhill from Tel Rumeida at the latest by Roman times. Herod the Great, king of Judea, built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs. During the First Jewish–Roman War, Hebron was captured and plundered by Simon Bar Giora, a leader of the Zealots, without bloodshed. The &quot;little town&quot; was later laid to waste by Vespasian&#x27;s officer Sextus Vettulenus Cerialis. Josephus wrote that he &quot;slew all he found there, young and old, and burnt down the town&quot;. After the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, innumerable Jewish captives were sold into slavery at Hebron&#x27;s Terebinth slave-market.

The city was part of the Byzantine Empire in Palaestina Prima province at the Diocese of the East. The Byzantine emperor Justinian I erected a Christian church over the Cave of Machpelah in the 6th century CE, which was later destroyed by the Sassanid general Shahrbaraz in 614 when Khosrau II&#x27;s armies besieged and took Jerusalem. Jews were not permitted to reside in Hebron under Byzantine rule. The sanctuary itself however was spared by the Persians, in deference to the Jewish population, who were numerous in the Sassanid army.

===Muslim conquest and Islamic caliphate===
Hebron was one of the last cities of Palestine to fall to the Islamic invasion in the 7th century, possibly the reason why Hebron is not mentioned in any traditions of the Arab conquest. When the Rashidun Caliphate established its rule over Hebron in 638, the Muslims converted the Byzantine church at the site of Abraham&#x27;s tomb into a mosque. It became an important station on the caravan trading route from Egypt, and also as a way-station for pilgrims making the yearly hajj from Damascus. After the fall of the city, Jerusalem&#x27;s conqueror, Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab permitted Jewish people to return and to construct a small synagogue within the Herodian precinct.

Catholic bishop Arculf, who visited the Holy Land during the Umayyad period, described the city as unfortified and poor. In his writings he also mentioned camel caravans transporting firewood from Hebron to Jerusalem, which implies there was a presence of Arab nomads in the region at that time. Trade greatly expanded, in particular with Bedouins in the Negev (&quot;al-Naqab&quot;) and the population to the east of the Dead Sea (&quot;Baḥr Lūṭ&quot;). According to Anton Kisa, Jews from Hebron (and Tyre) founded the Venetian glass industry in the 9th century.

Hebron was almost absent from Muslim literature before the 10th century. In 985, al-Muqaddasi described Hebron (Habra) as the village of Abraham al-Khalil, with a strong fortress and a stone dome over Abraham&#x27;s sepulchre. The mosque contained the tombs of Isaac, Jacob, and their wives. Surrounding the area were villages with vineyards producing exceptional grapes and apples. Hebron had a public guest house offering lentils and olive oil to both the poor and the rich. The guest house was established through the bequest of Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s companions, including Tamim-al Dari, and received generous donations. It was highly regarded as an excellent house of hospitality and charity in the realm of al-Islam. The custom, known as the &#x27;Table of Abraham&#x27; (&quot;simāt al-khalil&quot;), was similar to the one established by the Fatimids. In 1047, Nasir-i-Khusraw described Hebron in his Safarnama as having many villages providing revenues for pious purposes. He mentioned a spring flowing from under a stone, with water channeled to a covered tank outside the town. The Sanctuary stood on the town&#x27;s southern border, enclosed by four walls. Barley was the primary crop, with abundant olives. Visitors were provided with bread, olives, lentils cooked in olive oil, and raisins. Hebron had numerous mills operated by oxen and mules, along with working girls baking bread. The hospitality extended to about three-pound loaves of bread and meals for every arriving person, including up to 500 pilgrims on certain days.

The tradition survives to this day in the form of the Takiat Ibrahim soup kitchen, which has been active in providing food for thousands over Ramadan, which coincided with food shortages during the 2024 Israel–Hamas war. Geniza documents from this period mention &quot;the graves of the patriarchs&quot; and attest to the presence of an organised Jewish community in Hebron. The Jews maintained a synagogue near the tomb and earned their livelihood accommodating Jewish pilgrims and merchants. During the Seljuk period, the community was headed by Saadia b. Abraham b. Nathan, known as the &quot;&quot;haver&quot; of the graves of the patriarchs.&quot;

===Crusader and Ayyubid period===

The Caliphate lasted in the area until 1099, when the Christian Crusader Godfrey de Bouillon took Hebron and renamed it &quot;Castellion Saint Abraham&quot;. It was designated capital of the southern district of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and given, in turn, as the fief of Saint Abraham, to Geldemar Carpinel, the bishop Gerard of Avesnes, Hugh of Rebecques, Walter Mohamet and Baldwin of Saint Abraham. As a Frankish garrison of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, its defence was precarious being &#x27;little more than an island in a Moslem ocean&#x27;. The Crusaders converted the mosque and the synagogue into a church. In 1106, an Egyptian campaign thrust into southern Palestine and almost succeeded the following year in wresting Hebron back from the Crusaders under Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who personally led the counter-charge to beat the Muslim forces off. In the year 1113 during the reign of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, according to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and &quot;a number of Franks had made their entrance therein&quot;. And they discovered &quot;(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob&quot;, &quot;their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more&quot;. Similar information is given in Ibn at Athir&#x27;s Chronicle under the year 1119; &quot;In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob ...Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver.&quot; The Damascene nobleman and historian Ibn al-Qalanisi in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of relics purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery that excited eager curiosity among all three communities in Palestine, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian. Towards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 Maimonides visited Hebron and wrote,On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (October 17), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything.

A royal domain, Hebron was handed over to Philip of Milly in 1161 and joined with the Seigneurie of Transjordan. A bishop was appointed to Hebron in 1168 and the new cathedral church of St Abraham was built in the southern part of the Haram. In 1167, the episcopal see of Hebron was created along with that of Kerak and Sebastia (the tomb of John the Baptist). In 1170, Benjamin of Tudela visited Hebron, referred to as in its Frankish name &quot;St. Abram de Bron&quot;. He mentioned the great church called St. Abram, which was once a Jewish place of worship during the time of Muslim rule. The Gentiles had erected six tombs there, claimed to be those of Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah. The custodians collected money from pilgrims by presenting these tombs as the tombs of the Patriarchs. However, if a Jew offered a special reward, they would open an iron gate leading to a series of empty caves, until reaching the third cave where the actual sepulchers of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs were said to be located.

The Kurdish Muslim Saladin retook Hebron in 1187 – again with Jewish assistance according to one late tradition, in exchange for a letter of security allowing them to return to the city and build a synagogue there. The name of the city was changed back to &quot;Al-Khalil&quot;. A Kurdish quarter still existed in the town during the early period of Ottoman rule. Richard the Lionheart retook the city soon after. Richard of Cornwall, brought from England to settle the dangerous feuding between Templars and Hospitallers, whose rivalry imperiled the treaty guaranteeing regional stability stipulated with the Egyptian Sultan As-Salih Ayyub, managed to impose peace on the area. But soon after his departure, feuding broke out and in 1241 the Templars mounted a damaging raid on what was, by now, Muslim Hebron, in violation of agreements.

In 1244, the Khwarazmians destroyed the town, but left the sanctuary untouched.

===Mamluk period===
In 1260, after Mamluk Sultan Baibars defeated the Mongol army, the minarets were built onto the sanctuary. Six years later, while on pilgrimage to Hebron, Baibars promulgated an edict forbidding Christians and Jews from entering the sanctuary, and the climate became less tolerant of Jews and Christians than it had been under the prior Ayyubid rule. The edict for the exclusion of Christians and Jews was not strictly enforced until the middle of the 14th-century and by 1490, not even Muslims were permitted to enter the caverns. The mill at Artas was built in 1307, and the profits from its income were dedicated to the hospital in Hebron. Between 1318 and 1320, the Na&#x27;ib of Gaza and much of coastal and interior Palestine ordered the construction of Jawli Mosque to enlarge the prayer space for worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque.

Hebron was visited by important rabbis over the next two centuries, among them Nachmanides (1270) and Ishtori HaParchi (1322) who noted the old Jewish cemetery there. Sunni imam Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) was penalised by the religious authorities in Damascus for refusing to recognise Hebron as a Muslim pilgrimage site, a view also held by his teacher Ibn Taymiyyah. The Jewish-Italian traveller, Meshullam of Volterra (1481) found not more than twenty Jewish families living in Hebron. and recounted how the Jewish women of Hebron would disguise themselves with a veil in order to pass as Muslim women and enter the Cave of the Patriarchs without being recognized as Jews. Minute descriptions of Hebron were recorded in Stephen von Gumpenberg&#x27;s Journal (1449), by Felix Fabri (1483) and by Mejr ed-Din It was in this period, also, that the Mamluk Sultan Qa&#x27;it Bay revived the old custom of the Hebron &quot;table of Abraham&quot;, and exported it as a model for his own &quot;madrasa&quot; in Medina. This became an immense charitable establishment near the Haram, distributing daily some 1,200 loaves of bread to travellers of all faiths. The Italian rabbi Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura wrote around 1490:I was in the Cave of Machpelah, over which the mosque has been built; and the Arabs hold the place in high honour. All the Kings of the Arabs come here to repeat their prayers, but neither a Jew nor an Arab may enter the Cave itself, where the real graves of the Patriarchs are; the Arabs remain above, and let down burning torches into it through a window, for they keep a light always burning there. . Bread and lentil, or some other kind of pulse (seeds of peas or beans), is distributed (by the Muslims) to the poor every day without distinction of faith, and this is done in honour of Abraham.

===Early Ottoman period===
The expansion of the Ottoman Empire along the southern Mediterranean coast under sultan Selim I coincided with the establishment of Inquisition commissions by the Catholic Monarchs in Spain in 1478, which ended centuries of the Iberian &quot;convivencia&quot; (coexistence). The ensuing expulsions of the Jews drove many Sephardi Jews into the Ottoman provinces, and a slow influx of Jews to the Holy Land took place, with notable Sephardi kabbalists settling in Hebron. Over the following two centuries, there was a significant migration of Bedouin tribal groups from the Arabian Peninsula into Palestine. Many settled in three separate villages in the Wādī al-Khalīl, and their descendants later formed the majority of Hebron.

The Jewish community fluctuated between 8–10 families throughout the 16th century, and suffered from severe financial straits in the first half of the century. In 1540, renowned kabbalist Malkiel Ashkenazi bought a courtyard from the small Karaite community, in which he established the Sephardic Abraham Avinu Synagogue. In 1659, Abraham Pereyra of Amsterdam founded the &quot;Hesed Le&#x27;Abraham yeshiva&quot; in Hebron, which attracted many students. In the early 18th century, the Jewish community suffered from heavy debts, almost quadrupling from 1717 to 1729, and were &quot;almost crushed&quot; from the extortion practiced by the Turkish pashas. In 1773 or 1775, a substantial amount of money was extorted from the Jewish community after a false allegation that the son of a local sheikh was murdered and thrown into a cesspit.&gt; Emissaries from the community were frequently sent overseas to solicit funds. During the Ottoman period, the dilapidated patriarchs&#x27; tombs were restored to a semblance of dignity. Ali Bey, in Muslim disguise, was one of the few Westerners to gain access. In 1807 he reported that the sepulchres were covered with carpets of green silk embroidered in gold and those of the wives were covered in red silk.The sultans of Constantinople furnished these carpets, which were renewed from time to time. Ali Bey counted nine, one over the other, on the sepulchre of Abraham. Hebron also became known for its glass production, based on Bedouin trade networks that brought up minerals from the Dead Sea. The industry is mentioned in travel literature in 19th century written by Western travellers to Palestine. Ulrich Jasper Seetzen noted during his travels in Palestine in 1808–09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron, based on 26 kilns. In 1833, a report on the town in the weekly paper of the London-based Religious Tract Society wrote that Hebron had numerous well-provisioned shops and produced glass lamps which were exported to Egypt. Early 19th-century travellers also noted Hebron&#x27;s flourishing agriculture. It was a major exporter of &quot;dibse&quot;, grape sugar, from the famous Dabookeh grapestock characteristic of Hebron.
An Arab peasants&#x27; revolt broke out in April 1834 when Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt announced he would recruit troops from the local Muslim population. Hebron, headed by its nazir Abd ar-Rahman Amr, declined to supply its quota of conscripts for the army and suffered badly from the Egyptian campaign to crush the uprising. The town was invested and, when its defences fell on August 4, it was sacked by Ibrahim Pasha&#x27;s army. An estimated 500 Muslims from Hebron were killed in the attack and some 750 were conscripted. 120 youths were abducted and put at the disposal of Egyptian army officers. Most of the Muslim population managed to flee beforehand to the hills. Many Jews fled to Jerusalem, but during the general pillage of the town at least five were killed.
In 1838, the total population was estimated at 10,000. When the government of Ibrahim Pasha fell in 1841, the local clan leader Abd ar-Rahman Amr once again resumed the reins of power as the Sheik of Hebron. Due to his extortionate demands for cash from the local population, most of the Jewish population fled to Jerusalem. In 1846, the Ottoman Governor-in-chief of Jerusalem (&quot;serasker&quot;), Kıbrıslı Mehmed Emin Pasha, waged a campaign to subdue rebellious sheiks in the Hebron area, and while doing so, allowed his troops to sack the town. Though it was widely rumoured that he secretly protected Abd ar-Rahman, the latter was deported together with other local leaders (such as Muslih al-&#x27;Azza of Bayt Jibrin), but he managed to return to the area in 1848.

According to Hillel Cohen, the attacks on Jews in this particular period are an exception that proves the rule, that one of the easiest place for Jews to live in the world were in the various countries of the Ottoman Empire. In the mid-eighteenth century, rabbi Abraham Gershon of Kitov wrote from Hebron that:&quot;the gentiles here very much love the Jews. When there is a &quot;brit milah&quot; (circumcision ceremony) or any other celebration, their most important men come at night and rejoice with the Jews and clap hands and dance with the Jews, just like the Jews&#x27;.&quot;

===Late Ottoman period===
By 1850, the Jewish population consisted of 45–60 Sephardic families, some 40 born in the town, and a 30-year-old Ashkenazic community of 50 families, mainly Polish and Russian, the Lubavitch Hasidic movement having established a community in 1823. The ascendency of Ibrahim Pasha led to a decline in the local glass industry. His plan to build a Mediterranean fleet led to severe logging in Hebron&#x27;s forests, making firewood for the kilns scarce. At the same time, Egypt began importing cheap European glass. The rerouting of the hajj from Damascus through Transjordan reduced traffic to Hebron, and the Suez Canal (1869) precipitated a drop in caravan trade. The consequence was a steady deterioration of the local economy. At the time, the town was divided into four quarters: the Ancient Quarter (&quot;Harat al-Kadim&quot;) near the Cave of Machpelah; to its south, the Quarter of the Silk Merchant (&quot;Harat al-Kazaz&quot;), inhabited by Jews; the Mamluk-era Sheikh&#x27;s Quarter (&quot;Harat ash Sheikh&quot;) to the north-west; and further north, the Dense Quarter (&quot;Harat al-Harbah&quot;).In 1855, the newly appointed Ottoman &quot;pasha&quot; (&quot;governor&quot;) of the &quot;sanjak&quot; (&quot;district&quot;) of Jerusalem, Kamil Pasha, attempted to put down a rebellion in the Hebron region. Kamil and his army marched towards Hebron in July 1855, a scene witnessed by representatives of the English, French and other Western consulates. After crushing all opposition, Kamil appointed Salama Amr, brother and rival of Abd al Rachman, as &quot;nazir&quot; of the Hebron region. Relative quiet reigned in the town for the next 4 years. In 1866, Hungarian Jews of the Karlin Hasidic court settled in Hebron. According to Nadav Shragai, Arab-Jewish relations were good, and Alter Rivlin, who spoke Arabic and Syrian-Aramaic, was appointed Jewish representative to the city council. During a severe drought in 1869–1871, food in Hebron sold for ten times the normal amount. From 1874, the Hebron district was administered directly from Istanbul as part of the Sanjak of Jerusalem. By 1874, when C.R. Conder visited Hebron under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund, the Jewish community numbered 600 in an overall population of 17,000. The Jews lived in the Quarter of the Corner Gate. In the late 19th century the production of Hebron glass declined due to competition from imported European glassware, although it continued to be popular among those who could not afford luxury goods and was sold by Jewish merchants. Glass ornaments from Hebron were exhibited at the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna.

A report from the consul of the French Consulate in Jerusalem in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained an important source of income for Hebron, with four factories earning 60,000 francs yearly. While the economy of other cities in Palestine was based on solely on trade, the economy of Hebron was more diverse, including agriculture and livestock herding, along with glassware manufacturing and processing of hides. This was because the most fertile lands were situated within the city limits. Even so, Hebron had an image of being unproductive and an &quot;asylum for the poor and the spiritual&quot;. While the wealthy merchants of Nablus built fine mansions, housing in Hebron consisted of semi-peasant dwellings.

Hebron was described as &#x27;deeply Bedouin and Islamic&#x27;, and &#x27;bleakly conservative&#x27; in its religious outlook, with a strong tradition of hostility to Jews. It had a reputation for religious zeal in jealously protecting its sites from Jews and Christians, although the Jewish and Christian communities seem to have been an integral part of the local economy. As income from commerce declined and tax revenues diminished significantly, the Ottoman government left Hebron to manage its own affairs for the most part, making it &quot;one of the most autonomous regions in late Ottoman Palestine.&quot; The Jewish community was under French protection until 1914. The Jewish presence itself was divided between the traditional Sephardi community, whose members spoke Arabic and adopted Arab dress, and the more recent influx of Ashkenazi Jews. They prayed in different synagogues, sent their children to different schools, lived in different quarters and did not intermarry. The community was largely Orthodox and anti-Zionist.

===British Mandate===
The British occupied Hebron on December 8, 1917; governance transited to a mandate in 1920. Most of Hebron was owned by old Islamic charitable endowments (&quot;waqfs&quot;), with about 60% of all the land in and around Hebron belonging to the Tamīm al-Dārī waqf. In 1922, its population stood at 16,577, of which 16,074 (97%) were Muslim, 430 (2.5%) were Jewish and 73 (0.4%) were Christian. During the 1920s, Abd al-Ḥayy al-Khaṭīb was appointed Mufti of Hebron. Before his appointment, he had been a staunch opponent of Haj Amin, supported the Muslim National Associations and had good contacts with the Zionists. Later, al-Khaṭīb became one of the few loyal followers of Haj Amin in Hebron. During the late Ottoman period, a new ruling elite had emerged in Palestine. They later formed the core of the growing Arab nationalist movement in the early 20th century. During the Mandate period, delegates from Hebron constituted only 1 per cent of the political leadership. The Palestinian Arab decision to boycott the 1923 elections for a Legislative Council was made at the fifth Palestinian Congress, after it was reported by Murshid Shahin (an Arab pro-Zionist activist) that there was intense resistance in Hebron to the elections. Almost no house in Hebron remained undamaged when an earthquake struck Palestine on July 11, 1927.

The Cave of the Patriarchs continued to remain officially closed to non-Muslims, and reports that entry to the site had been relaxed in 1928 were denied by the Supreme Muslim Council.

At this time following attempts by the Lithuanian government to draft yeshiva students into the army, the Lithuanian Hebron Yeshiva (Knesses Yisroel) relocated to Hebron, after consultations between Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, Yechezkel Sarna and Moshe Mordechai Epstein. and by 1929 had attracted some 265 students from Europe and the United States. The majority of the Jewish population lived on the outskirts of Hebron along the roads to Be&#x27;ersheba and Jerusalem, renting homes owned by Arabs, a number of which were built for the express purpose of housing Jewish tenants, with a few dozen within the city around the synagogues. During the 1929 Hebron massacre, Arab rioters slaughtered some 64 to 67 Jewish men, women and children and wounded 60, and Jewish homes and synagogues were ransacked; 435 Jews survived by virtue of the shelter and assistance offered them by their Arab neighbours, who hid them. Some Hebron Arabs, including Ahmad Rashid al-Hirbawi, president of Hebron chamber of commerce, supported the return of Jews after the massacre. Two years later, 35 families moved back into the ruins of the Jewish quarter, but on the eve of the Palestinian Arab revolt (April 23, 1936) the British Government decided to move the Jewish community out of Hebron as a precautionary measure to secure its safety. The sole exception was the 8th generation Hebronite Ya&#x27;akov ben Shalom Ezra, who processed dairy products in the city, blended in well with its social landscape and resided there under the protection of friends. In November 1947, in anticipation of the UN partition vote, the Ezra family closed its shop and left the city. Yossi Ezra has since tried to regain his family&#x27;s property through the Israeli courts.

===Jordanian period===

At the beginning of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt took control of Hebron. Between May and October, Egypt and Jordan tussled for dominance in Hebron and its environs. Both countries appointed military governors in the town, hoping to gain recognition from Hebron officials. The Egyptians managed to persuade the pro-Jordanian mayor to support their rule, at least superficially, but local opinion turned against them when they imposed taxes. Villagers surrounding Hebron resisted and skirmishes broke out in which some were killed. By late 1948, part of the Egyptian forces from Bethlehem to Hebron had been cut off from their lines of supply and Glubb Pasha sent 350 Arab Legionnaires and an armoured car unit to Hebron to reinforce them there. When the Armistice was signed, the city thus fell under Jordanian military control. The armistice agreement between Israel with Jordan intended to allow Israeli Jewish pilgrims to visit Hebron, but, as Jews of all nationalities were forbidden by Jordan into the country, this did not occur.

In December 1948, the Jericho Conference, held by Jordan, was convened to decide the future of the West Bank. Hebron notables, headed by mayor Muhamad &#x27;Ali al-Ja&#x27;bari, voted in favour of becoming part of Jordan and to recognise Abdullah I of Jordan as their king. The subsequent unilateral annexation benefited the Arabs of Hebron, who during the 1950s, played a significant role in the economic development of Jordan.

Although a significant number of people relocated to Jerusalem from Hebron during the Jordanian period, Hebron itself saw a considerable increase in population with 35,000 settling in the town. During this period, signs of the previous Jewish presence in Hebron were removed.

===Israeli occupation===
After the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel occupied Hebron along with the rest of the West Bank, establishing a military government to rule the area. In an attempt to reach a land for peace deal, Yigal Allon proposed that Israel annex 45% of the West Bank and return the remainder to Jordan. According to the Allon Plan, the city of Hebron would lie in Jordanian territory, and in order to determine Israel&#x27;s own border, Allon suggested building a Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron. David Ben-Gurion also considered that Hebron was the one sector of the conquered territories that should remain under Jewish control and be open to Jewish settlement. Apart from its symbolic message to the international community that Israel&#x27;s rights in Hebron were, according to Jews, inalienable, settling Hebron also had theological significance in some quarters. For some, the capture of Hebron by Israel had unleashed a messianic fervor.
Survivors and descendants of the prior community are mixed. Some support the project of Jewish redevelopment, others commend living in peace with Hebronite Arabs, while a third group recommend a full pullout. Descendants supporting the latter views have met with Palestinian leaders in Hebron. In 1997 one group of descendants dissociated themselves from the settlers by calling them an obstacle to peace. On May 15, 2006, a member of a group who is a direct descendant of the 1929 refugees urged the government to continue its support of Jewish settlement, and allow the return of eight families evacuated the previous January from homes they set up in emptied shops near the Avraham Avinu neighborhood. Beit HaShalom, established in 2007 under disputed circumstances, was under court orders permitting its forced evacuation. All the Jewish settlers were expelled on December 3, 2008.
Immediately after the 1967 war, mayor al-Ja&#x27;bari had unsuccessfully promoted the creation of an autonomous Palestinian entity in the West Bank, and by 1972, he was advocating for a confederal arrangement with Jordan instead. al-Ja&#x27;bari nevertheless consistently fostered a conciliatory policy towards Israel. He was ousted by Fahad Qawasimi in the 1976 mayoral election, which marked a shift in support towards pro-PLO nationalist leaders. Supporters of Jewish settlement within Hebron see their program as the reclamation of an important heritage dating back to Biblical times, which was dispersed or, it is argued, stolen by Arabs after the massacre of 1929. The purpose of settlement is to return to the &#x27;land of our forefathers&#x27;, and the Hebron model of reclaiming sacred sites in Palestinian territories has pioneered a pattern for settlers in Bethlehem and Nablus. Many reports, foreign and Israeli, are sharply critical of the behaviour of Hebronite settlers.

Sheik Farid Khader heads the Ja&#x27;bari tribe, consisting of some 35,000 people, which is considered one of the most important tribes in Hebron. For years, members of the Ja&#x27;bari tribe were the mayors of Hebron. Khader regularly meets with settlers and Israeli government officials and is a strong opponent of both the concept of Palestinian State and the Palestinian Authority itself. Khader believes that Jews and Arabs must learn to coexist. A violent episode occurred May 2, 1980, when an Al Fatah squad killed five yeshiva students and one other person on their way home from Sabbath prayer at the Tomb of the Patriarchs. The event provided a major motivation for settlers near Hebron to join the Jewish Underground. 

In the 1980s Hebron, became the center of the Jewish Kach movement, a designated terrorist organization, whose first operations started there, and provided a model for similar behaviour in other settlements. On July 26, 1983, Israeli settlers attacked the Islamic University and shot three people dead and injured over thirty others. The 1994 Shamgar Commission of Inquiry concluded that Israeli authorities had consistently failed to investigate or prosecute crimes committed by settlers against Palestinians. Hebron IDF commander Noam Tivon said that his foremost concern is to &quot;ensure the security of the Jewish settlers&quot; and that Israeli &quot;soldiers have acted with the utmost restraint and have not initiated any shooting attacks or violence&quot;.

=== Division of Hebron ===

Hebron was the one city excluded from the interim agreement of September 1995 to restore rule over all Palestinian West Bank cities to the Palestinian Authority. IDF soldiers see their job as being to protect Israeli settlers from Palestinian residents, not to police the Israeli settlers. IDF soldiers are instructed to leave violent Israeli settlers for the police to deal with. Since The Oslo Agreement, violent episodes have been recurrent in the city. The Cave of the Patriarchs massacre took place on February 25, 1994, when Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli physician and resident of Kiryat Arba, opened fire on Muslims at prayer in the Ibrahimi Mosque, killing 29, and wounding 125 before the survivors overcame and killed him. Standing orders for Israeli soldiers on duty in Hebron disallowed them from firing on fellow Jews, even if they were shooting Arabs. This event was condemned by the Israeli Government, and the extreme right-wing Kach party was banned as a result. The Israeli government also tightened restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in H2, closed their vegetable and meat markets, and banned Palestinian cars on Al-Shuhada Street. The park near the Cave of the Patriarchs for recreation and barbecues is off-limits for Arab Hebronites. Following the 1995 Oslo Agreement and subsequent 1997 Hebron Agreement, Palestinian cities were placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, with the exception of Hebron, which was split into two sectors: H1 is controlled by the Palestinian Authority and H2 – which includes the Old City of Hebron – remained under the military control of Israel. Around 120,000 Palestinians live in H1, while around 30,000 Palestinians along with around 700 Israelis remain under Israeli military control in H2. , a total of 86 Jewish families lived in Hebron. The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) may not enter H1 unless under Palestinian escort. Palestinians cannot approach areas where settlers live without special permits from the IDF. The Jewish settlement is widely considered to be illegal by the international community, although the Israeli government disputes this.

Over the period of the First Intifada and Second Intifada, the Jewish community was subjected to attacks by Palestinian militants, especially during the periods of the intifadas; which saw 3 fatal stabbings and 9 fatal shootings in between the first and second Intifada (0.9% of all fatalities in Israel and the West Bank) and 17 fatal shootings (9 soldiers and 8 settlers) and 2 fatalities from a bombing during the second Intifada, and thousands of rounds fired on it from the hills above the Abu-Sneina and Harat al-Sheikh neighbourhoods. On November 15, 2002, 12 Israeli soldiers were killed (Hebron Brigade commander Colonel Dror Weinberg and two other officers, 6 soldiers and 3 members of the security unit of Kiryat Arba) in an ambush. Two Temporary International Presence in Hebron observers were killed by Palestinian gunmen in a shooting attack on the road to Hebron On March 27, 2001, a Palestinian sniper targeted and killed the Jewish baby Shalhevet Pass. The sniper was caught in 2002. Hebron is one of the three West Bank towns from which the majority of suicide bombers originate. In May 2003, three students of the Hebron Polytechnic University carried out three separate suicide attacks. In August 2003, in what both Islamic groups described as a retaliation, a 29-year-old preacher from Hebron, Raed Abdel-Hamed Mesk, broke a unilateral Palestinian ceasefire by killing 23 and injured over 130 in a bus bombing in Jerusalem. In 2007, the Palestinian population in H2 declined due to Israeli security measures such as extended curfews, strict restrictions on movement, the closure of Palestinian businesses and settler harassment. Palestinians are barred from using Al-Shuhada Street, a principal commercial thoroughfare that is locally nicknamed &quot;Apartheid Street&quot; as a result.

Israeli organization B&#x27;Tselem states that there have been &quot;grave violations&quot; of Palestinian human rights in Hebron because of the &quot;presence of the settlers within the city&quot;. The organization cites regular incidents of &quot;almost daily physical violence and property damage by settlers in the city&quot;, curfews and restrictions of movement that are &quot;among the harshest in the Occupied Territories&quot;, and violence by Israeli border policemen and the IDF against Palestinians who live in the city&#x27;s H2 sector. According to Human Rights Watch, Palestinian areas of Hebron are frequently subject to indiscriminate firing by the IDF, leading to many casualties. One former IDF soldier, with experience in policing Hebron, has testified to Breaking the Silence, that on the briefing wall of his unit a sign describing their mission aim was hung that read: &quot;To disrupt the routine of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.&quot; Hebron mayor Mustafa Abdel Nabi invited the Christian Peacemaker Teams to assist the local Palestinian community in opposition to what they describe as Israeli military occupation, collective punishment, settler harassment, home demolitions and land expropriation. In 2017, Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) issued a confidential report covering their 20 years of work in Hebron. The report, based in part on over 40,000 incidents reported during this period, stated that Israel violated international law in Hebron and has breached the rights of residents as established by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The report claimed that Israel violated Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the deportation of civilians from occupied territory. Israeli settlement in Hebron was also cited as a violation.

In 1820, it was reported that there were about 1,000 Jews in Hebron. In 1838, Hebron had an estimated 1,500 taxable Muslim households, in addition to 41 Jewish tax-payers. Taxpayers consisted here of male heads of households who owned even a very small shop or piece of land. 200 Jews and one Christian household were under &#x27;European protections&#x27;. The total population was estimated at 10,000. In 1842, it was estimated that about 400 Arab and 120 Jewish families lived in Hebron, the latter having been diminished in number following the destruction of 1834.

Hebron had a population of 201,063 Palestinians in 2017, and seven hundred Jewish settlers concentrated on the outskirts of its Old City. Roughly 20% of the city, including 35,000 Palestinians, under Israeli military administration, lives in the region of H2 Hebron. Hebron is capital of the Hebron Governorate. With adjoining governorate, the city forms a metropolitan area, known as Hebron metropolitan area, with an estimated population of around 782,227 . It is third largest metropolitan area in Palestine, followed by Gaza and Jerusalem.

Hebron is also home to several ethnic minority and foreign diaspora communities. Kurds have been living in the city since Saladin&#x27;s conquest of Palestine. Along with Jerusalem and Gaza, the city is also home to Palestinians of Kurdish descent. Nearly a third of the population of Hebron, is considered to be of Kurdish background. The Kurdish Quarter, known as &quot;Harat al-Akrad&quot;, still exists today. Hebron is also home to a small Samaritan community, after Nablus.

== Geography ==

Hebron is situated on the southern West Bank. Nestled in the Judaean Mountains, it lies above sea level. Hebron is located south of Jerusalem, east of Gaza, southeest of Beersheba and northeast of Tel Aviv, both in Israel and northeast of Amman, Jordan. The city is surrounded by Bani Na&#x27;im and Dura to the east, Halhul to the north, Taffuh to the west and Yatta to the south. The Israeli–controlled H2 region is located in the eastern region of the city.

It is one of the highest cities in the area and was, until the 19th century, considered the highest city in the Middle East. With the governorate and metropolitan area, it forms about 19% of the West Bank total area. The city is surrounded by several mountains and hills, including the Hebron Hills (&quot;Jabal al–Khalil&quot;) and Mount Nabi Yunis. The Mount Nabi Yunis, situated north of the city, is the highest point in Palestine, with an altitude of 1,030 metres (3,380 ft). While the Hebron Hills is southern part of the wider Judaean Mountains, which spreads throughout Israel and Palestine and have an altitude of 1,026 m (3,366 ft). The two larger settlements whose population exceeds 7000 sit on the hills overlooking the Hebron&#x27;s eastern quarters – Kirayt Arba and Givat Harsina. Wadi al–Quff near Hebron is one of the largest natural reserves in Palestine. Located towards northeast of the city, it is surrounded by nearby towns and villages of Tarqumia, Halhoul, Beit Kahel and Beit Ola. The natural reserve covers up an area of . Wadi al–Quff Natural reserve is home to some of the rare species of animals and plants.

Hebron is located on fertile mountainous area, making the city agriculturally rich, thus giving it a strategic importance. This is the reason for Hebron, today being a hub for cultivation of fruits and vineyards. The alternative sources of water network is cisterns. There are ten springs and three wells in the city. The water of springs and wells are not currently used. The Hebron River (&quot;Wadi al–Khalil&quot;), known as &quot;Nahal Hebron&quot; in Hebrew located along the region of Judea and Negev, is one of the water sources for the city. Currently the river is polluted, mainly due to the generation of waste, mostly by the industrial areas, situated on the city&#x27;s east and south.

=== Climate ===
The climate in Hebron is temperate and the mean year-round temperature ranges between 15 and 16° (an average of 7° in winter and 21° in summer). Annual precipitations average around 502 mm. Hebron has &quot;a&quot; Mediterranean, hot summer climate (Classification: Csa). The city&#x27;s yearly temperature is 22.74 °C (72.93 °F) and it is 0.14% higher than Palestine&#x27;s averages. It typically receives about 15.72 millimeters (0.62 inches) of precipitation and has 39.47 rainy days (10.81% of the time) annually, during January and February.

=== Urban development ===

Historically, the city consisted of four densely populated quarters: the &quot;suq&quot; and &quot;Harat al-Masharqa&quot; adjacent to the Ibrahimi Mosque, the Silk Merchant Quarter (&quot;Haret Kheitun&quot;) to the south and the Sheikh Quarter (&quot;Haret al-Sheikh&quot;) to the north. It is believed the basic urban structure of the city had been established by the Mamluk period, during which time the city also had Jewish, Christian and Kurdish quarters.
In the mid 19th-century, Hebron was still divided into four quarters, but the Christian quarter had disappeared. The sections included the ancient quarter surrounding the Cave of Machpelah, the &quot;Haret Kheitun&quot; (the Jewish Quarter, &quot;Haret el-Yahud&quot;), the &quot;Haret el-Sheikh&quot; and the Druze Quarter. As Hebron&#x27;s population gradually increased, inhabitants preferred to build upwards rather than leave the safety of their neighbourhoods. By the 1880s, better security provided by the Ottoman authorities allowed the town to expand and a new commercial centre, &quot;Bab el-Zawiye&quot;, emerged. As development continued, new spacious and taller structures were built to the north-west. In 1918, the town consisted of dense clusters of residential dwellings along the valley, rising onto the slopes above it. By the 1920s, the town was made up of seven quarters: &quot;el-Sheikh&quot; and &quot;Bab el-Zawiye&quot; to the west, &quot;el-Kazzazin&quot;, &quot;el-Akkabi&quot; and &quot;el-Haram&quot; in the centre, &quot;el-Musharika&quot; to the south and &quot;el-Kheitun&quot; in the east. Urban sprawl had spread onto the surrounding hills by 1945. 

The large population increase under Jordanian rule resulted in about 1,800 new houses being built, most of them along the Hebron-Jerusalem highway, stretching northwards for over at a depth of 600 ft (200m) either way. Some 500 houses were built elsewhere on surrounding rural land. There was less development to the south-east, where housing units extended along the valley for about 1 mile (1.5 km). In 1971, with the assistance of the Israeli and Jordanian governments, the Hebron University, an Islamic university, was founded. In an attempt to enhance the view of the Ibrahami Mosque, Jordan demolished whole blocks of ancient houses opposite its entrance, which also resulted in improved access to the historic site. The Jordanians also demolished the old synagogue located in the el-Kazzazin Quarter. In 1976, Israel recovered the site, which had been converted into an animal pen, and by 1989, a settler courtyard had been established there.

Today, the area along the north–south axis to the east comprises the modern city of Hebron (also called Upper Hebron, &quot;Khalil Foq&quot;). It was established towards the end of the Ottoman period, its inhabitants being upper and middle class Hebronites who moved there from the crowded old city, &quot;Balde al-Qadime&quot; (also called Lower Hebron, &quot;Khalil Takht&quot;). The northern part of Upper Hebron includes some up-scale residential districts and also houses the Hebron University, private hospitals and the only two luxury hotels in the city. The main commercial artery of the city is located here, situated along the Jerusalem Road, and includes modern multi-storey shopping malls. Also in this area are villas and apartment complexes built on the &quot;krum&quot;, rural lands and vineyards, which used to function as recreation areas during the summer months until the early Jordanian period. The southern part is where the working-class neighbourhoods are located, along with large industrial zones and the Hebron Polytechnic University. The main municipal and governmental buildings are located in the centre of the city. This area includes high-rise concrete and glass developments and also some distinct Ottoman era one-storey family houses, adorned with arched entrances, decorative motifs and ironwork. Hebron&#x27;s domestic appliance and textile markets are located here along two parallel roads that lead to the entrance of the old city. Many of these have been relocated from the old commercial centre of the city, known as the vegetable market (&quot;hesbe&quot;), which was closed down by the Israeli military during the 1990s. The vegetable market is now located in the square of &quot;Bab el-Zawiye&quot;.

==Economy==
Hebron is a leading commercial and industrial center in the Levantine region. The presence of minerals and resources in surroundings have increased the city&#x27;s value. It emerged as in important trade hub in the West Bank. Hebron is most productive region in the country after Jerusalem–Bethlehem–Ramallah area. The H1 Area, which is under control of Palestinian Authority have been a large contributor to the city&#x27;s economy. Despite having tense relations, Israelis and Palestinians have strong trade relations in Hebron. The city is popular for its ceramics and glass industry.

It is the source of 60% of stone and marble resources in the West Bank. 33% of the Palestine&#x27;s GNP is from Hebron, including 60% of the jewelry industry and jewelry production, 28% of the output in the agricultural sector and 75% of the leather and shoe industry. Most agricultural products from Palestinian controlled Hebron are sent to Israel. Trade volume between Israel and the Palestine reaches $30 billion annually and the city trades with China as well. The minimum wage is 50 NIS per day versus an average of 30 NIS per day in other Palestinian areas.From the 1970s to the early 1990s, a third of those who lived in the city worked in the shoe industry. According to the shoe factory owner Tareq Abu Felat, the number reached least 35,000 people and there were more than 1,000 workshops around the city. Statistics from the Chamber of Commerce in Hebron put the figure at 40,000 people employed in 1,200 shoe businesses. However, the 1993 Oslo Accords and 1994 Paris Protocol between Israel and the PLO made it possible to mass import Chinese goods as the Palestinian National Authority, which was created after the Oslo Accords, did not regulate it. They later put import taxes but the Abu Felat, who also is the Palestinian Federation of Leather Industries&#x27;s chairman, said more is still needed. The Palestinian government decided to impose an additional tax of 35% on products from China from April 2013.
90% of the shoes in Palestine are now estimated to come from China, which Palestinian industry workers say are of much lower quality but also much cheaper, and the Chinese are more aesthetic. Another factor contributing to the decline of the local industry is Israeli restrictions on Palestinian exports. Today, there are less than 300 workshops in the shoe industry, who only run part-time, and they employ around 3,000–4,000 people. More than 50% of the shoes are exported to Israel, where consumers have a better economy. Less than 25% goes to the Palestinian market, with some going to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.

The most advanced printing press in the Middle East is in Hebron. Hebron is major source of import goods to Israel. Mattresses manufactured in Hebron are exported to Israeli markets in Tel Aviv, Beersheba and Haifa. Around 17,000 factories and workshops are located throughout the Area H1. Historically, the traditional glass industry is popular in Hebron. A new industrial city has been built in Tarqumiyah, which houses more than 140 factories. Royal Industrial Trading operates a pipe manufacturing plant in Hebron, which is spread across an area of and employs over 650 people. In 2021, an electronic recycling factory was opened in Idhna and operates to this day. The European Union and the World Bank proposed to construct a regional water treatment plant, which will treat existing sewage stream coming from 80% of the city. The city is a hub for the jewelry industry and houses approximately 70 jewelry factories employing over 1500 workers.

Super Nimer company manufactures sanitary ware products and water network from its factory, whose area ranges from to . Opened in 2004, Super Tiger operates a factory spread across an area of . During the COVID-19 pandemic in the State of Palestine, Hebron rapidly transformed into a medical supplies manufacturing hub, with numerous factories installing and commissioning new production lines for the product and was approved by the Ministry of National Economy.

==Political status==
Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine passed by the UN in 1947, Hebron was envisaged to become part of an Arab state. While the Jewish leaders accepted the partition plan, the Arab leadership (the Arab Higher Committee in Palestine and the Arab League) rejected it, opposing any partition. The aftermath of the 1948 war saw the city occupied and later unilaterally annexed by the kingdom of Jordan in a move supported by local Hebron officials. Following the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel occupied Hebron. In 1997, in accordance with the Hebron Agreement, Israel withdrew from 80 per cent of Hebron, which was handed over to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian police would assume responsibilities in Area H1 and Israel would retain control in Area H2.

An international unarmed observer force—the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) was subsequently established to help the normalization of the situation and to maintain a buffer between the Palestinian Arab population of the city and the Jewish population residing in their enclave in the old city. The TIPH operates with the permission of the Israeli government, meeting regularly with the Israeli army and the Israeli Civil Administration, and is granted free access throughout the city. In 2018, the TIPH came under criticism in Israel due to incidents where an employee was, according to the Israeli police, filmed puncturing the tires of the car of an Israeli settler, and another instance where an observer was deported after slapped a settler boy.

The post-1967 settlement in Hebron was driven by theological doctrines from the Mercaz HaRav Kook, which consider the Land of Israel and its people as holy, and believe that the messianic Age of Redemption has arrived. Hebron holds special significance in this narrative, with traditions linking it to Abraham, King David, and the entrance to the Garden of Eden. Settling in Hebron is seen as a right and duty, a favor to the world, and an example of being &quot;a light unto the nations&quot; (&quot;Or la-Goyim&quot;). This viewpoint has resulted in numerous violent clashes with Palestinians, which some settlers see as contributing to the messianic process.

=== Occupation and settlements ===
In 1968, Rabbi Moshe Levinger and a group of Israelis, disguised as tourists, rented the main hotel in Hebron and refused to leave. The government initially wanted to evacuate the settlers but eventually allowed them to relocate to a nearby military base, which became the settlement of Kiryat Arba. After lobbying efforts, the settlement gained support from some Israeli leaders. Over time, the settlement expanded with the outpost Givat Ha&#x27;avot. The operation was planned and financed by the Movement for Greater Israel. In 2011, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that Jews have no right to properties they possessed in places like Hebron before 1948 and are not entitled to compensation for their losses. Originally named Hesed l&#x27;Avraham, Beit Hadassah was constructed in 1893 with donations of Baghdadi Jewish families and was the only modern medical facility in Hebron. In 1909, it was renamed after Hadassah Women&#x27;s Zionist Organization of America, which took responsibility for the medical staff and provided free medical care to all. In 1979, a group of 15 settler mothers and their 35 children squatted in the Dabouia building in Hebron, exploiting the government&#x27;s indecision during negotiations with Egypt. Led by Miriam Levinger, they established a bridgehead for Jewish resettlement and created conflict with Arab shopkeepers. A retaliatory attack by a Palestinian group resulted in the death of six yeshiva students. Despite appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court, the settlers remained. The following year, the government legitimized residency in Hebron and expelled the elected mayor. This pattern of settlement followed by hostilities with Palestinians was repeated in Tel Rumeida.
The Abraham Avinu Synagogue was the physical and spiritual center of its neighborhood and regarded as one of the most beautiful synagogues in Palestine. It was the centre of Jewish worship in Hebron until it was burnt down during the 1929 riots. In 1948 under Jordanian rule, the remaining ruins were razed. The Avraham Avinu quarter was established next to the Vegetable and Wholesale Markets on Al-Shuhada Street in the south of the Old City. The vegetable market was closed by the Israeli military and some of the neighbouring houses were occupied by settlers and soldiers. Settlers started to take over the closed Palestinian stores, despite explicit orders of the Israeli Supreme Court that the settlers should vacate these stores and the Palestinians should be allowed to return. Beit Romano was built and owned by Yisrael Avraham Romano of Constantinople and served Sephardi Jews from Turkey. In 1901, a Yeshiva was established there with a dozen teachers and up to 60 students. In 1982, Israeli authorities took over a Palestinian education office (Osama Ben Munqez School) and the adjacent bus station. The school was turned into a settlement, and the bus station into a military base against an order of the Israeli Supreme Court. In 1807 the immigrant Sephardic Rabbi Haim Yeshua Hamitzri (Haim the Jewish Egyptian) purchased 5 dunams on the outskirts of the city and in 1811 he signed a contract for a 99-year lease on a further 800 dunams of land, which included 4 plots in Tel Rumeida. The plots were administered by his descendant Haim Bajaio after Jews left Hebron. Settlers&#x27; claims to this land are based on these precedents, but are dismissed by the rabbi&#x27;s heir. In 1984, settlers established a caravan outpost there called Ramat Yeshai. In 1998, the government recognized it as a settlement, and in 2001 the Defence Minister approved the building of the first housing units. 

In 2012, Israel Defense Forces called for the immediate removal of a new settlement, because it was seen as a provocation. The IDF, in accordance with settler demands, requested the removal of a Palestinian flag on a Hebronite rooftop contiguous to settlements, though no rule forbids the practice. According to Palestinians, the IDF negotiated the removal of the flag in exchange for the release of a resident of Hebron from legal custody. In August 2016, Israel announced its intention to allow settlement building in the military compound of &quot;Plugat Hamitkanim&quot; in Hebron, which had been expropriated for military purposes in the 1990s. In late 2019, the Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett instructed the military administration to inform the Palestinian municipality of the government&#x27;s intention to reconstruct infrastructure in the old Hebron fruit and vegetable market in order to establish a Jewish neighbourhood there, which would allow for doubling the city&#x27;s settler population. The area&#x27;s original residents, who have protected tenancy rights there, were compelled to evacuate the zone after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. The original site was under Jewish ownership prior to 1948. The plan proposes that the empty shops remain Palestinian while the units built over them house Jewish Israelis.

== Culture ==

=== Tourism ===
Hebron is home to numerous mosques, synagogues, churches, parks, palaces, castles and forts. The Old City of Hebron was a declared a Palestinian World Heritage Site by UNESCO on 7th July 2017. The move caused controversies and faced opposition from Israeli officials who objected to it being called as Palestinian site, instead of Israeli. It is one of the best preserved sites of the Mamluk era.

* The most famous site in Hebron is the Cave of the Patriarchs. The Herodian era structure is said to enclose the tombs of the biblical Patriarchs and Matriarchs. The site is known for the burial place of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca and Leah respectively. The Isaac Hall now serves as the Ibrahimi mosque, while the Abraham and Jacob Hall serve as a synagogue. 
* The tombs of other biblical figures – Abner ben Ner, Otniel ben Kenaz, Ruth and Jesse are also located in the city. It is reverred to Christians, Muslims and Jews. These sites are located in the H2 region, which is controlled by the Israeli authorities.
* The early Ottoman-era Abraham Avinu Synagogue in the city&#x27;s historic Jewish Quarter was built in 1540 and restored in 1738.
* Mosques from the era include the Sheikh Ali al-Bakka and Al-Jawali mosque.

Hebron is also home to several sites for Christian worship, with numerous churches located around the city. The Oak of Sibta (Oak of Abraham) is an ancient tree which, in non-Jewish tradition, is said to mark the place where Abraham pitched his tent. The Russian Orthodox Church owns the site and the nearby Abraham&#x27;s Oak Holy Trinity Monastery, consecrated in 1925. Hebron is one of the few cities to have preserved its Mamluk architecture. Many structures were built during the period, especially Sufi zawiyas. 

Other sites:

* Situated on the northeast of the city, Wadi al–Quff Natural Reserve is visited by 2,000 people, mostly on weekends. It is currently under the management of the Palestinian government. 
* Aristobolia (&quot;Khirbet Istanbul&quot;), in south of Hebron, near Zif village, is home to Byzantine-era basilica, built during the beginning of Islamic era. 
* &quot;Khirbet al–Karmil&quot; is home to Crusader pool, ruined Byzantine church and Crusader fortress. 
* As-Samu is an ancient biblical village, currently a modern town. It is home to 4th century synagogue, numerous Ottoman-era structure and an Islamic building, probably built during the time of Saladin of the Ayyubid dynasty.

=== Religious traditions ===

Some Jewish traditions regarding Adam place him in Hebron after his expulsion from Eden. Another has Cain kill Abel there. A third has Adam and Eve buried in the cave of Machpelah. A Jewish-Christian tradition had it that Adam was formed from the red clay of the field of Damascus, near Hebron. A tradition arose in medieval Jewish texts that the Cave of the Patriarchs itself was the very entrance to the Garden of Eden. During the Middle Ages, pilgrims and the inhabitants of Hebron would eat the red earth as a charm against misfortune. Others report that the soil was harvested for export as a precious medicinal spice in Egypt, Arabia, Ethiopia and India and that the earth refilled after every digging. Legend also tells that Noah planted his vineyard on Mount Hebron. In medieval Christian tradition, Hebron was one of the three cities where Elizabeth was said to live, the legend implying that it might have been the birthplace of John the Baptist.

One Islamic tradition has it that Muhammad alighted in Hebron during his night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem, and the mosque in the city is said to conserve one of his shoes. Another tradition states that Muhammad arranged for Hebron and its surrounding villages to become part of Tamim al-Dari&#x27;s domain; this was implemented during Umar&#x27;s reign as caliph. According to the arrangement, al-Dari and his descendants were only permitted to tax the residents for their land and the &quot;waqf&quot; of the Ibrahimi Mosque was entrusted to them. The &quot;simat al-Khalil&quot; or &quot;Table of Abraham&quot; is attested to in the writings of the 11th century Persian traveller Nasir-i Khusraw. According to the account, this early Islamic food distribution center — which predates the Ottoman &quot;imarets&quot; — gave all visitors to Hebron a loaf of bread, a bowl of lentils in olive oil, and some raisins.

According to Tamara Neuman, settlement by a community of Jewish religious fundamentalists has brought about three major changes by redesigning a Palestinian area in terms of biblical imagery and origins: remaking over these revamped religious sites to endow them with an innovative centrality to Jewish worship, that, she argues, effectively erases the diasporic thrust of Jewish tradition; and writing out the overlapping aspects of Judaism, Christianity and Islam in such a way that the possibility of accommodation between the three intertwined traditions is eradicated, while the presence of Palestinians themselves is erased by violent methods.

<doc id="38579" wikidata="Q11412" url="?curid=38579" title="Gravity">
<text>In physics, gravity () is a fundamental interaction primarily observed as a mutual attraction between all things that have mass. Gravity is, by far, the weakest of the four fundamental interactions, approximately 1038 times weaker than the strong interaction, 1036 times weaker than the electromagnetic force, and 1029 times weaker than the weak interaction. As a result, it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic particles. However, gravity is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light.

On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon&#x27;s gravity is responsible for sublunar tides in the oceans. The corresponding antipodal tide is caused by the inertia of the Earth and Moon orbiting one another. Gravity also has many important biological functions, helping to guide the growth of plants through the process of gravitropism and influencing the circulation of fluids in multicellular organisms.

The gravitational attraction between the original gaseous matter in the universe caused it to coalesce and form stars which eventually condensed into galaxies, so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away.

Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915, which describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole, from which nothing—not even light—can escape once past the black hole&#x27;s event horizon. However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Current models of particle physics imply that the earliest instance of gravity in the universe, possibly in the form of quantum gravity, supergravity, or a gravitational singularity, along with ordinary space and time, developed during the Planck epoch (up to 10−43 seconds after the birth of the universe), possibly from a primeval state, such as a false vacuum, quantum vacuum or virtual particle, in a currently unknown manner. Scientists are currently working to develop a theory of gravity consistent with quantum mechanics, a quantum gravity theory, which would allow gravity to be united in a common mathematical framework (a theory of everything) with the other three fundamental interactions of physics.

==Definitions==
, also known as gravitational attraction, is the mutual attraction between all masses in the universe. Gravity is the gravitational attraction at the surface of a planet or other celestial body; gravity may also include, in addition to gravitation, the centrifugal force resulting from the planet&#x27;s rotation .

==History==
===Ancient world===
The nature and mechanism of gravity were explored by a wide range of ancient scholars. In Greece, Aristotle believed that objects fell towards the Earth because the Earth was the center of the Universe and attracted all of the mass in the Universe towards it. He also thought that the speed of a falling object should increase with its weight, a conclusion that was later shown to be false. While Aristotle&#x27;s view was widely accepted throughout Ancient Greece, there were other thinkers such as Plutarch who correctly predicted that the attraction of gravity was not unique to the Earth.

Although he did not understand gravity as a force, the ancient Greek philosopher Archimedes discovered the center of gravity of a triangle. He postulated that if two equal weights did not have the same center of gravity, the center of gravity of the two weights together would be in the middle of the line that joins their centers of gravity. Two centuries later, the Roman engineer and architect Vitruvius contended in his &quot;De architectura&quot; that gravity is not dependent on a substance&#x27;s weight but rather on its &quot;nature&quot;.
In the 6th century CE, the Byzantine Alexandrian scholar John Philoponus proposed the theory of impetus, which modifies Aristotle&#x27;s theory that &quot;continuation of motion depends on continued action of a force&quot; by incorporating a causative force that diminishes over time.

In 628 CE, the Indian mathematician and astronomer Brahmagupta proposed the idea that gravity is an attractive force that draws objects to the Earth and used the term &quot;&quot; to describe it.

In the ancient Middle East, gravity was a topic of fierce debate. The Persian intellectual Al-Biruni believed that the force of gravity was not unique to the Earth, and he correctly assumed that other heavenly bodies should exert a gravitational attraction as well. In contrast, Al-Khazini held the same position as Aristotle that all matter in the Universe is attracted to the center of the Earth.

===Scientific revolution===

In the mid-16th century, various European scientists experimentally disproved the Aristotelian notion that heavier objects fall at a faster rate. In particular, the Spanish Dominican priest Domingo de Soto wrote in 1551 that bodies in free fall uniformly accelerate. De Soto may have been influenced by earlier experiments conducted by other Dominican priests in Italy, including those by Benedetto Varchi, Francesco Beato, Luca Ghini, and Giovan Bellaso which contradicted Aristotle&#x27;s teachings on the fall of bodies. 

The mid-16th century Italian physicist Giambattista Benedetti published papers claiming that, due to specific gravity, objects made of the same material but with different masses would fall at the same speed. With the 1586 Delft tower experiment, the Flemish physicist Simon Stevin observed that two cannonballs of differing sizes and weights fell at the same rate when dropped from a tower. In the late 16th century, Galileo Galilei&#x27;s careful measurements of balls rolling down inclines allowed him to firmly establish that gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects. Galileo postulated that air resistance is the reason that objects with a low density and high surface area fall more slowly in an atmosphere.

In 1604, Galileo correctly hypothesized that the distance of a falling object is proportional to the square of the time elapsed. This was later confirmed by Italian scientists Jesuits Grimaldi and Riccioli between 1640 and 1650. They also calculated the magnitude of the Earth&#x27;s gravity by measuring the oscillations of a pendulum.

===Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation===

In 1657, Robert Hooke published his &quot;Micrographia&quot;, in which he hypothesized that the Moon must have its own gravity. In 1666, he added two further principles: that all bodies move in straight lines until deflected by some force and that the attractive force is stronger for closer bodies. In a communication to the Royal Society in 1666, Hooke wrote

Hooke&#x27;s 1674 Gresham lecture, &quot;An Attempt to prove the Annual Motion of the Earth&quot;, explained that gravitation applied to &quot;all celestial bodies&quot; 
In 1684, Newton sent a manuscript to Edmond Halley titled &quot;De motu corporum in gyrum (&#x27;On the motion of bodies in an orbit&#x27;)&quot;, which provided a physical justification for Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion. Halley was impressed by the manuscript and urged Newton to expand on it, and a few years later Newton published a groundbreaking book called &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (&quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;). In this book, Newton described gravitation as a universal force, and claimed that &quot;the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must [be] reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve.&quot; This statement was later condensed into the following inverse-square law:

formula_1where is the force, and are the masses of the objects interacting, is the distance between the centers of the masses and is the gravitational constant 

Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; was well received by the scientific community, and his law of gravitation quickly spread across the European world. More than a century later, in 1821, his theory of gravitation rose to even greater prominence when it was used to predict the existence of Neptune. In that year, the French astronomer Alexis Bouvard used this theory to create a table modeling the orbit of Uranus, which was shown to differ significantly from the planet&#x27;s actual trajectory. In order to explain this discrepancy, many astronomers speculated that there might be a large object beyond the orbit of Uranus which was disrupting its orbit. In 1846, the astronomers John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier independently used Newton&#x27;s law to predict Neptune&#x27;s location in the night sky, and the planet was discovered there within a day.

===General relativity===
Eventually, astronomers noticed an eccentricity in the orbit of the planet Mercury which could not be explained by Newton&#x27;s theory: the perihelion of the orbit was increasing by about 42.98 arcseconds per century. The most obvious explanation for this discrepancy was an as-yet-undiscovered celestial body, such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury, but all efforts to find such a body turned out to be fruitless. In 1915, Albert Einstein developed a theory of general relativity which was able to accurately model Mercury&#x27;s orbit.

In general relativity, the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime curvature instead of a force. Einstein began to toy with this idea in the form of the equivalence principle, a discovery which he later described as &quot;the happiest thought of my life.&quot; In this theory, free fall is considered to be equivalent to inertial motion, meaning that free-falling inertial objects are accelerated relative to non-inertial observers on the ground. In contrast to Newtonian physics, Einstein believed that it was possible for this acceleration to occur without any force being applied to the object.

Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. These straight paths are called geodesics. As in Newton&#x27;s first law of motion, Einstein believed that a force applied to an object would cause it to deviate from a geodesic. For instance, people standing on the surface of the Earth are prevented from following a geodesic path because the mechanical resistance of the Earth exerts an upward force on them. This explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial.

Einstein&#x27;s description of gravity was quickly accepted by the majority of physicists, as it was able to explain a wide variety of previously baffling experimental results. In the coming years, a wide range of experiments provided additional support for the idea of general relativity. Today, Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity is used for all gravitational calculations where absolute precision is desired, although Newton&#x27;s inverse-square law is accurate enough for virtually all ordinary calculations.

== Modern research ==
In modern physics, general relativity remains the framework for the understanding of gravity. Physicists continue to work to find solutions to the Einstein field equations that form the basis of general relativity and continue to test the theory, finding excellent agreement in all cases.

=== Einstein field equations ===
The Einstein field equations are a system of 10 partial differential equations which describe how matter affects the curvature of spacetime. The system is often expressed in the form
formula_2
where is the Einstein tensor, is the metric tensor, is the stress–energy tensor, is the cosmological constant, formula_3 is the Newtonian constant of gravitation and formula_4 is the speed of light. The constant formula_5 is referred to as the Einstein gravitational constant.
A major area of research is the discovery of exact solutions to the Einstein field equations. Solving these equations amounts to calculating a precise value for the metric tensor (which defines the curvature and geometry of spacetime) under certain physical conditions. There is no formal definition for what constitutes such solutions, but most scientists agree that they should be expressable using elementary functions or linear differential equations. Some of the most notable solutions of the equations include: 
* The Schwarzschild solution, which describes spacetime surrounding a spherically symmetric non-rotating uncharged massive object. For compact enough objects, this solution generated a black hole with a central singularity. At points far away from the central mass, the accelerations predicted by the Schwarzschild solution are nearly identical to those predicted by Newton&#x27;s theory of gravity.
* The Reissner–Nordström solution, which analyzes a non-rotating spherically symmetric object with charge and was independently discovered by several different researchers between 1916 and 1921. In some cases, this solution can predict the existence of black holes with double event horizons.
* The Kerr solution, which generalizes the Schwarzchild solution to rotating massive objects. Because of the difficulty of factoring in the effects of rotation into the Einstein field equations, this solution was not discovered until 1963.
* The Kerr–Newman solution for charged, rotating massive objects. This solution was derived in 1964, using the same technique of complex coordinate transformation that was used for the Kerr solution. 
* The cosmological Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker solution, discovered in 1922 by Alexander Friedmann and then confirmed in 1927 by Georges Lemaître. This solution was revolutionary for predicting the expansion of the Universe, which was confirmed seven years later after a series of measurements by Edwin Hubble. It even showed that general relativity was incompatible with a static universe, and Einstein later conceded that he had been wrong to design his field equations to account for a Universe that was not expanding.

Today, there remain many important situations in which the Einstein field equations have not been solved. Chief among these is the two-body problem, which concerns the geometry of spacetime around two mutually interacting massive objects, such as the Sun and the Earth, or the two stars in a binary star system. The situation gets even more complicated when considering the interactions of three or more massive bodies (the &quot;&quot;n&quot;-body problem&quot;), and some scientists suspect that the Einstein field equations will never be solved in this context. However, it is still possible to construct an approximate solution to the field equations in the &quot;n&quot;-body problem by using the technique of post-Newtonian expansion. In general, the extreme nonlinearity of the Einstein field equations makes it difficult to solve them in all but the most specific cases.

===Gravity and quantum mechanics===
Despite its success in predicting the effects of gravity at large scales, general relativity is ultimately incompatible with quantum mechanics. This is because general relativity describes gravity as a smooth, continuous distortion of spacetime, while quantum mechanics holds that all forces arise from the exchange of discrete particles known as quanta. This contradiction is especially vexing to physicists because the other three fundamental forces (strong force, weak force and electromagnetism) were reconciled with a quantum framework decades ago. As a result, modern researchers have begun to search for a theory that could unite both gravity and quantum mechanics under a more general framework.

One path is to describe gravity in the framework of quantum field theory, which has been successful to accurately describe the other fundamental interactions. The electromagnetic force arises from an exchange of virtual photons, where the QFT description of gravity is that there is an exchange of virtual gravitons. This description reproduces general relativity in the classical limit. However, this approach fails at short distances of the order of the Planck length, where a more complete theory of quantum gravity (or a new approach to quantum mechanics) is required.

=== Tests of general relativity ===

Testing the predictions of general relativity has historically been difficult, because they are almost identical to the predictions of Newtonian gravity for small energies and masses. Still, since its development, an ongoing series of experimental results have provided support for the theory: In 1919, the British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington was able to confirm the predicted gravitational lensing of light during that year&#x27;s solar eclipse. Eddington measured starlight deflections twice those predicted by Newtonian corpuscular theory, in accordance with the predictions of general relativity. Although Eddington&#x27;s analysis was later disputed, this experiment made Einstein famous almost overnight and caused general relativity to become widely accepted in the scientific community.

In 1959, American physicists Robert Pound and Glen Rebka performed an experiment in which they used gamma rays to confirm the prediction of gravitational time dilation. By sending the rays down a 74-foot tower and measuring their frequency at the bottom, the scientists confirmed that light is Doppler shifted as it moves towards a source of gravity. The observed shift also supports the idea that time runs more slowly in the presence of a gravitational field (many more wave crests pass in a given interval). If light moves outward from a strong source of gravity it will be observed with a redshift. The time delay of light passing close to a massive object was first identified by Irwin I. Shapiro in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.

In 1971, scientists discovered the first-ever black hole in the galaxy Cygnus. The black hole was detected because it was emitting bursts of x-rays as it consumed a smaller star, and it came to be known as Cygnus X-1. This discovery confirmed yet another prediction of general relativity, because Einstein&#x27;s equations implied that light could not escape from a sufficiently large and compact object.

General relativity states that gravity acts on light and matter equally, meaning that a sufficiently massive object could warp light around it and create a gravitational lens. This phenomenon was first confirmed by observation in 1979 using the 2.1 meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, which saw two mirror images of the same quasar whose light had been bent around the galaxy YGKOW G1.

Frame dragging, the idea that a rotating massive object should twist spacetime around it, was confirmed by Gravity Probe B results in 2011. In 2015, the LIGO observatory detected faint gravitational waves, the existence of which had been predicted by general relativity. Scientists believe that the waves emanated from a black hole merger that occurred 1.5 billion light-years away.

==Specifics==

===Earth&#x27;s gravity===
Every planetary body (including the Earth) is surrounded by its own gravitational field, which can be conceptualized with Newtonian physics as exerting an attractive force on all objects. Assuming a spherically symmetrical planet, the strength of this field at any given point above the surface is proportional to the planetary body&#x27;s mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the body.

The strength of the gravitational field is numerically equal to the acceleration of objects under its influence. The rate of acceleration of falling objects near the Earth&#x27;s surface varies very slightly depending on latitude, surface features such as mountains and ridges, and perhaps unusually high or low sub-surface densities. For purposes of weights and measures, a standard gravity value is defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, under the International System of Units (SI).

The force of gravity experienced by objects on Earth&#x27;s surface is the vector sum of two forces: (a) The gravitational attraction in accordance with Newton&#x27;s universal law of gravitation, and (b) the centrifugal force, which results from the choice of an earthbound, rotating frame of reference. The force of gravity is weakest at the equator because of the centrifugal force caused by the Earth&#x27;s rotation and because points on the equator are farthest from the center of the Earth. The force of gravity varies with latitude, and the resultant acceleration increases from about 9.780 m/s2 at the Equator to about 9.832 m/s2 at the poles.

===Gravitational radiation===
General relativity predicts that energy can be transported out of a system through gravitational radiation. The first indirect evidence for gravitational radiation was through measurements of the Hulse–Taylor binary in 1973. This system consists of a pulsar and neutron star in orbit around one another. Its orbital period has decreased since its initial discovery due to a loss of energy, which is consistent for the amount of energy loss due to gravitational radiation. This research was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993.

The first direct evidence for gravitational radiation was measured on 14 September 2015 by the LIGO detectors. The gravitational waves emitted during the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light years from Earth were measured. This observation confirms the theoretical predictions of Einstein and others that such waves exist. It also opens the way for practical observation and understanding of the nature of gravity and events in the Universe including the Big Bang. Neutron star and black hole formation also create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation. This research was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017.

===Speed of gravity===

In December 2012, a research team in China announced that it had produced measurements of the phase lag of Earth tides during full and new moons which seem to prove that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light. This means that if the Sun suddenly disappeared, the Earth would keep orbiting the vacant point normally for 8 minutes, which is the time light takes to travel that distance. The team&#x27;s findings were released in &quot;Science Bulletin&quot; in February 2013.

In October 2017, the LIGO and Virgo detectors received gravitational wave signals within 2 seconds of gamma ray satellites and optical telescopes seeing signals from the same direction. This confirmed that the speed of gravitational waves was the same as the speed of light.

==Anomalies and discrepancies==
There are some observations that are not adequately accounted for, which may point to the need for better theories of gravity or perhaps be explained in other ways.

* Extra-fast stars: Stars in galaxies follow a distribution of velocities where stars on the outskirts are moving faster than they should according to the observed distributions of normal matter. Galaxies within galaxy clusters show a similar pattern. Dark matter, which would interact through gravitation but not electromagnetically, would account for the discrepancy. Various modifications to Newtonian dynamics have also been proposed.
* Accelerated expansion: The expansion of the universe seems to be speeding up. Dark energy has been proposed to explain this.
* Flyby anomaly: Various spacecraft have experienced greater acceleration than expected during gravity assist maneuvers. The Pioneer anomaly has been shown to be explained by thermal recoil due to the distant sun radiation on one side of the space craft.

<text>Poltava (, ; , ) is a city located on the Vorskla River in Central Ukraine. It serves as the administrative center of Poltava Oblast as well as Poltava Raion within the oblast. It also hosts the administration of Poltava urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Poltava has a population of 

==History==

It is still unknown when Poltava was founded, although the town was not attested before 1174. However, municipal authorities chose to celebrate the city&#x27;s 1100th anniversary in 1999. The settlement is indeed an old one, as archeologists unearthed an ancient Paleolithic dwelling, as well as Scythian remains, within the city limits.

===Middle Ages===
The present name of the city is traditionally connected to the settlement Ltava, which is mentioned in the &quot;Hypatian Chronicle&quot; in 1174. According to the chronicle, on Saint Peter&#x27;s Day (12 July) of 1182, Igor Sviatoslavich, chasing hordes of the Cuman khans Konchak and Kobiak, crossed the Vorskla River near &quot;Ltava&quot; and moved towards Pereiaslav), where Igor&#x27;s army was victorious over the Cumans. During the Mongol invasion of Rus&#x27; in 1238–39, many cities of the middle Dnipro region were destroyed, possibly including Ltava.

In the mid-14th century the region was part of the Duchy of Kyiv, which was a vassal of the Algirdas&#x27; Grand Duchy of Lithuania. According to the Russian historian Aleksandr Shennikov, the region around modern Poltava was a Cuman Duchy belonging to Mansur, who was a son of Mamai. Shennikov also claims that the Mansur Duchy joined the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as an associated state rather than a vassal state, and that the city of Poltava already existed at that time. In 1399, Mansur&#x27;s army assisted the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army in the battle of the Vorskla River. According to legend, after the battle, the Cossack Mamay helped Vytautas to escape death.

The city is mentioned for the first time under the name of Poltava no later than 1430. Supposedly, in 1430 the Lithuanian duke Vytautas gave the city, along with Glinsk (today a village near the city of Romny) and Glinitsa, to Murza Olexa (Loxada Mansurxanovich), who moved to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the Golden Horde. In 1430 Murza Olexa was baptized as Alexander Glinsky, who was a progenitor of the Glinsky family. According to Shenninkov, Alexander Glinsky must have been baptized in 1390 by Cyprian, Metropolitan of Kyiv, who had just regained his title of Metropolitan of Kyiv and all Russia (rather than the Metropolitan of Russia Minor and Lithuania). On 6 March 1390 Cyprian permanently moved to Muscovy.

In 1482, Poltava was razed by the Crimean Khan Mengli I Giray.

===Early modern period===

In 1537 Ografena Vasylivna Glinska (Baibuza) passed Poltava to her son-in-law Mykhailo Ivanovych Hrybunov-Baibuza.

After the Union of Lublin in 1569, the territory around Poltava became part of the Crown of Poland. In 1630 Poltava was passed to a Polish magnate, Bartholomew Obalkowski. In 1641 it changed ownership again, to Alexander Koniecpolski. In 1646 Poltava became part of Wiśniowiecki Ordynatsia (a large Wiśniowiecki estate in Left-bank Ukraine centered in Lubny), governed by the Ruthenian-Polish magnate Jeremi Wiśniowiecki (1612–51). 

In 1648, the city became the base of a distinguished regiment of Ukrainian Cossacks, and served as a Cossack stronghold during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. In 1650, to commemorate a victory of the Cossack Host over the Polish army at the Poltavka River, the Metropolitan of Kyiv, Sylvester Kossov, ordered the establishment of the Holy Cross Exaltation Monastery in Poltava. The project was financed by a number of prominent local residents, including Martyn Pushkar, Ivan Iskra, Ivan Kramar and many others.

During the 1654 Pereyaslav Council, the Poltava city delegates pledged their allegiance to the Czar of Muscovy, after which stolnik Andrei Spasitelev arrived in Poltava and recorded 1,335 residents who had pledged their allegiance. In 1658 Poltava became a center of anti-government revolt led by Martyn Pushkar, who contested the legitimacy of Ivan Vyhovsky&#x27;s election to the post of Hetman of Zaporizhian Host. The uprising was extinguished with the help of Crimean Tatars. 

On the issue boyar Vasily Borisovich Sheremetev wrote to Alexei Mikhailovich on 8 June 1658: &quot;... the &quot;Cherkas&quot; [Cossack] city of Poltava is ravaged and burned to the ground and only if the Great Sovereign orders to rebuild on the Tatar Sokma (pathway) of Bakeyev Route and protect many his sovereign cities from Tatar visits. And if the Great Sovereign allows to place a voivode in the city and rebuilt the city until the fall that in Poltava &quot;Cherkasy&quot; [Cossacks] and residents built their houses and stock-piled their food&quot;. With the signing of the 1667 truce of Andrusovo, the city was finally subjected to the Tsardom of Muscovy, while remaining part of the Cossack Hetmanate.

The city suffered from the Great Turkish War when in 1695 Petro Ivanenko led an anti-Muscovite uprising with the help of Crimean Tatars, who ravaged the local monastery. The same year the Poltava Regiment actively participated in the Azov campaigns which resulted in the taking of the Turkish fortress of Kyzy-Kermen (today the city of Beryslav, Kherson Oblast). On 8 July (New Style) or 27 June (Old Style) 1709 the Battle of Poltava took place near the city during the Great Northern War. The battle ended in a decisive victory of Peter I of Russia over the Swedish forces and had great historical importance for the Russians. In 1710 there was a plague in the city and its surrounding area. In the mid-18th century the Kolomak Woods near Poltava became a base of haidamaks (Cossack paramilitary bands).

By 1770, Poltava had several brick factories, a regimental doctor, and a pharmacy; that same year the city conducted four fairs. In 1775 it became a city of Novorossiysk Governorate, guarded by the 8th Company of the Dnieper Pike Regiment headquartered in Kobeliaky. In 1775 Poltava&#x27;s Holy Cross Exaltation Monastery became the seat of bishops of the newly created Eparchy (Diocese) of Slaviansk and Kherson. This large new diocese included the lands of the Novorossiya Governorate and the Azov Governorate north of the Black Sea.

Since much of that area had only recently been seized from the Ottoman Empire by Russia, and a large number of Orthodox Greek settlers had been invited to settle in the region, the imperial government selected a renowned Greek scholar, Eugenios Voulgaris, to preside over the new diocese. After his retirement in 1779, he was replaced by another Greek theologian, Nikephoros Theotokis.

In 1779 the city established the Poltava county school, which became its first secular educational institution. In 1787 Catherine the Great stopped in Poltava on the way from Crimea, escorted by Grigori Potemkin, Alexander Suvorov and Mikhail Kutuzov. In Poltava, on 7 June 1787, before another Russo-Turkish War, Potemkin received his title &quot;Prince of Taurida&quot;, while Suvorov received a snuffbox with monogram. In 1802 the city became the seat of the newly established Poltava Governorate. The city&#x27;s population in 1802 consisted of some 8,000 residents. That same year Poltava opened a government-funded hospital of 20 beds.

===19th century===
On 2 February 1808, the Poltava Male Gymnasium was established. On 20 June 1808 some 54 families of craftsmen were invited to the city from German principalities and settled in the newly established German Sloboda neighborhood with about 50 clay-made houses. In 1810 there were 8,328 people living in Poltava; that same year, the city&#x27;s first theater was built. In August 1812, on orders of Little Russia Governor General Lobanov-Rostovsky, the famed Ukrainian writer and statesman Ivan Kotlyarevsky formed the 5th Poltava Cavalry Cossack Regiment.

By 1860, Poltava had around 30,000 inhabitants, a district school, a gymnasium, an Institute for Noble Maidens, a spiritual academy, a cadet corps, a library and a number of schools. In 1870, Poltava railway station was opened, leading to rapid economic growth in the region. However, by 1914 the Population of Poltava (around 60,000) was mostly working in small enterprises. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries Poltava became an important cultural centre, where many representatives of Ukrainian national revival were active.

===20th century===

During the events of 1917–1920, Poltava was under the rule of a number of governments, including the Central Rada, Hetmanate, Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, White Movement and Bolsheviks. From 1918 to 1919 there was Occupation of Poltava by the Bolsheviks. After becoming a part of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Poltava experienced accelerated industrial growth, and its population increased to 130,000 by 1939.

In World War II, the Nazi &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; occupied Poltava from 18 September 1941 until 23 September 1943, when it was retaken during the Chernigov-Poltava Strategic Offensive of the Battle of the Dnieper. During the Nazi occupation the Jewish population (9.9% of the total population in 1939) was imprisoned in a ghetto before being murdered during mass executions perpetrated by an Einsatzgruppe and buried in mass graves in the area. 

By the summer of 1944, the United States Army Air Forces conducted a number of shuttle bombing raids against Nazi Germany under the name of Operation Frantic. Poltava Air Base, as well as Myrhorod Air Base, were used as eastern locations for landing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers involved in those operations.

The post-war restoration of Poltava continued in the 1950s and 1960s. The city became an important centre of military education in the Soviet Union, where missile and communications officers were prepared, and was also home to a Soviet Air Force division of heavy bombers.

Until 18 July 2020, Poltava was designated as a city of oblast significance and did not belong to Poltava Raion even though it was the center of the raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Poltava Oblast to four, the city was merged into Poltava Raion.
== Population ==
=== Language ===
Distribution of the population by native language according to the 2001 census:
According to a survey conducted by the International Republican Institute in April-May 2023, 75 % of the city&#x27;s population spoke Ukrainian at home, and 12 % spoke Russian.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Poltava has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;), with four distinct seasons, it is one of the coldest cities in Ukraine. The annual precipitation is fairly evenly distributed, with the highest concentration in summer, and which falls as snow in winter.


==Government and subdivisions==
Poltava is the administrative center of the Poltava Oblast (province) as well as of the Poltava Raion housed within the city. However, Poltava is a city of oblast subordinance, thus being subject directly to the oblast authorities rather to the raion administration housed in the city itself.

Poltava&#x27;s government consists of the 50-member Poltava City Council () which is headed by the Secretary (currently Oleksandr Kozub). The city&#x27;s current mayor is Oleksandr Mamay, who was sworn in on 4 November 2010 after being elected with more than 61 percent of the vote. In 2015 he was re-elected as a candidate of Conscience of Ukraine with 62.9% in a second round of Mayoral election.

The territory of Poltava is divided into 3 urban districts:
# Shevchenkivskyi District, to the south-west with an area of 2077 hectares and a population of 147,600 in 2005. It is a largely residential area and includes the city centre.
# Kyivskyi District, is the largest by area, comprising 5437 hectares, or 52.8% of the city total situated in the north and north-west. Its census in 2005 was 111,900. This district has a large industrial zone.
# Podilskyi District, to the east and south-east, in the valley of the Vorskla river, with an area of 2988 hectares and a population of 53,700 in 2005.

The village of Rozsoshentsi, Shcherbani, Tereshky, Kopyly and Suprunivka are officially considered to be outside the city, but constitute part of the Poltava agglomeration.

==Culture==

The centre of the old city is a semicircular Neoclassical square with the Tuscan column of cast iron (1805–11), commemorating the centenary of the Battle of Poltava and featuring 18 Swedish cannons captured in that battle. As Peter the Great celebrated his victory in the Saviour church, this 17th-century wooden shrine was carefully preserved to this day. The five-domed city cathedral, dedicated to the Exaltation of the Cross, is a superb monument of Cossack Baroque, built between 1699 and 1709. As a whole, the cathedral presents a unity which even the Neoclassical belltower has failed to mar. Another frothy Baroque church, dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos, was destroyed in 1934 and rebuilt in the 1990s.

A minor planet 2983 Poltava discovered in 1981 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh is named after the city.

===Sports===

The most popular sport is football (soccer). Two professional football teams are based in the city: Vorskla Poltava in the Ukrainian Premier League and FC Poltava in the Second League.
There are 3 stadiums in Poltava: Butovsky Vorskla Stadium (main city stadium), Dynamo Stadium are situated in the city centre and Lokomotiv Stadium which is situated in Podil district.

<text>Charles XIV John (; 26 January 1763 – 8 March 1844) was King of Sweden and Norway from 1818 until his death in 1844 and the first monarch of the Bernadotte dynasty. In Norway, he is known as Charles III John () and before he became royalty in Sweden, his name was Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte. During the Napoleonic Wars, he participated in several battles as a Marshal of France.

Born in Pau in the region of southern France known as Béarn, Bernadotte joined the French Royal Army in 1780. Following the outbreak of the French Revolution, he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks, and was made a brigadier general by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War. His relationship with Napoleon was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a Marshal of the Empire on the proclamation of the French Empire. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at Austerlitz, and was made Prince of Pontecorvo as a reward. His marriage to Désirée Clary, whose sister was married to Joseph Bonaparte, made Bernadotte a member of the extended Imperial family.

In 1810, Bernadotte was unexpectedly elected the heir-presumptive (Crown Prince) to the childless King Charles XIII of Sweden, thanks to the advocacy of Baron Carl Otto Mörner, a Swedish courtier and obscure member of the Riksdag of the Estates. He assumed the name Charles John and was named regent and generalissimo of the Swedish Armed Forces, soon after his arrival becoming &quot;de facto&quot; head of state for most of his time as Crown Prince. In 1812, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of Swedish Pomerania, Crown Prince Charles John was instrumental in the creation of the Sixth Coalition by allying with Alexander I of Russia and using Swedish diplomacy to bring warring Russia and Britain together in alliance. He then played a major role in the writing of the Trachenberg Plan, the war-winning Allied campaign plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North that defeated two concerted French attempts to capture Berlin and made the decisive attack on the last day of the catastrophic French defeat at Leipzig.

Following the conclusion of the Leipzig campaign and after liberating Bremen and Lübeck from the French in late November 1813, Charles John invaded Denmark, aiming to knock Napoleon&#x27;s last major ally out of the war to secure the Coalition&#x27;s northern flank in preparation for the invasion of France in 1814 and to secure Norway for Sweden, as stipulated in the several treaties that created the Sixth Coalition. After a brief campaign that saw the defeat of the Danish Army, King Frederick VI of Denmark was forced to sign the Treaty of Kiel on 15 January 1814 that ceded Norway to Sweden, that in turn led to the Swedish–Norwegian War of 1814, where Norway was defeated in nineteen days. This put Norway into a union with Sweden, which lasted for almost a century before its peaceful 1905 dissolution. The Swedish–Norwegian war is viewed as Sweden&#x27;s last direct conflict and war.

Upon the death of Charles XIII in 1818, Charles John ascended to the thrones. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.

==Early life and family==

Jean Bernadotte was born on 26 January 1763 in Pau, the capital of the province of Béarn in the southwestern part of the Kingdom of France. He was the son of Jean Henri Bernadotte (1711–1780), prosecutor at Pau, and his wife (married at Boeil, 20 February 1754) Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728–1809), niece of the lay abbot of Sireix. The family name was originally du Poey (or de Pouey), but was changed to Bernadottea surname of an ancestress at the beginning of the 17th century. He was the youngest of five siblings, two of whom died in childhood. Soon after his birth, Baptiste was added to his name, to distinguish him from his elder brother Jean Évangeliste. Bernadotte himself added Jules to his first names as a tribute to the French Empire under Napoleon I.

At the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a local attorney. Aged 17, his father&#x27;s death dissuaded him from following in his career.

==Early military career==
Bernadotte joined the army as a private in the Régiment Royal–La Marine on 3 September 1780, and first served in the newly conquered territory of Corsica. Subsequently, the Régiment stationed in Besançon, Grenoble, Vienne, Marseille and Île de Ré. He reached the rank of sergeant in August 1785 and was nicknamed &quot;Sergeant Belle-Jambe&quot;, for his smart appearance. In early 1790 he was promoted to Adjutant-Major, the highest rank for non-commissioned officers in the Ancien Régime.

==Revolutionary Wars==

Following the outbreak of the French Revolution, his eminent military qualities brought him speedy promotion. Bernadotte&#x27;s promotions came both from the esteem of his commanders as well as from his men; having been elected to the rank of lieutenant colonel and colonel by his men, though he refused both nominations in favor of traditional advancement.

It was during this period of rapid advancement that the military qualities he became known for, daring assaults and , came to the fore. Of the latter, Bernadotte was gifted in his ability to inspire his men to prodigious feats of valor. He has been compared by historians to fellow Gascon, D&#x27;Artagnan. One of his biographers asserts that Dumas used Bernadotte as the model for his D&#x27;Artagnan. As Colonel and commander of the 71st Demi-Brigade, Bernadotte rallied his men, who were retreating in disorder before an Austrian attack, by tearing off his epaulettes, throwing them to the ground before his men and shouting “If you dishonor yourselves by flight, I refuse to remain your colonel!” Soldiers left the ranks, gathered his epaulettes, pressed them into his hands, formed ranks and reformed the line and counter-attacked.

By 1794 he was promoted to brigadier, attached to the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. After Jourdan&#x27;s victory at Fleurus (26 June 1794), where he distinguished himself with a decisive attack and seizure of key terrain that led to the Austrian retreat, he became a divisional general.

Bernadotte played key roles throughout the next 18 months during the three French invasions into Germany; often employed in the place of honor during offensives leading the vanguard, and in retreat as a defensive specialist commanding the rearguard.

At the Battle of Theiningen (1796), where the Austrians outnumbered the French three to one, Bernadotte&#x27;s rear-guard successfully repulsed numerous attacks while inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, preventing the Archduke Charles from cutting off the retreat of the French army over the Rhine after its defeat by the Austrians at the Battle of Würzburg.

At the beginning of 1797 he was ordered by the Directory to march with 20,000 men as reinforcements to Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s army in Italy. His successful crossing of the Alps through the storm in midwinter was highly praised but coldly received by the Army of Italy. Upon receiving insult from Dominique Martin Dupuy, the commander of Milan, Bernadotte was to arrest him for insubordination. Dupuy was a close friend of Louis-Alexandre Berthier and this started a long-lasting feud between Bernadotte and Berthier, who would become Napoleon&#x27;s chief of staff.

He had his first interview with Napoleon in Mantua and was appointed the commander of the 4th division. During the invasion of Friuli and Istria, Bernadotte distinguished himself greatly at the passage of the Tagliamento where he led the vanguard, and at the capture of the fortress of Gradisca (19 March 1797). After the 18th Fructidor, Napoleon ordered his generals to collect from their respective divisions&#x27; addresses in favor of the coup d&#x27;état of that day; but Bernadotte sent an address to the Directory different from that which Napoleon wished for and without conveying it through Napoleon&#x27;s hands.

After the Treaty of Campo Formio, Napoleon gave Bernadotte a friendly visit at his headquarters at Udine, but immediately after deprived him of half his division of the army of the Rhine, and commanded him to march the other half back to France. Paul Barras, one of five directors, was cautious that Napoleon would overturn the Republic, so he appointed Bernadotte commander-in-chief of the Army of Italy in order to offset Napoleon&#x27;s power. Bernadotte was pleased with this appointment but Napoleon lobbied Talleyrand-Périgord, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to appoint him to the embassy of Vienna instead. Bernadotte was very dissatisfied; he finally accepted the post in Vienna, but had to quit owing to the disturbances caused by his hoisting the tricolour over the embassy.
After returning from Vienna, he resided in Paris. He married Désirée Clary in August 1798, the daughter of a Marseilles merchant, and once engaged to Napoleon, and Joseph Bonaparte&#x27;s sister-in-law. In November of the same year he was made commander of the army of observation on the upper Rhine. Although solicited to do so by Barras and Joseph Bonaparte, he did not take part in the coup d&#x27;état of the 30th Prairial. From 2 July to 14 September he was Minister of War, in which capacity he displayed great ability. His popularity and contacts with radical Jacobins aroused antipathy of him in the government. On the morning of 13 September he found his resignation announced in &quot;Le Moniteur Universel&quot; before he was aware that he had tendered it. This was a trick; played upon him by Sieyès and Roger Ducos, the directors allied to Napoleon.

Though Bernadotte declined to help Napoleon Bonaparte stage his &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of November 1799, Napoleon was resolved to win over the &quot;Obstacle Man&quot; and showered him with honors. Napoleon acknowledged Bernadotte&#x27;s administrative ability and influence by naming him a Councillor of State in February 1800. In April 1800, despite his republican sympathies, Bernadotte was offered, and freely accepted, from April 1800 to 18 August 1801, the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the West in the rebellious Vendée where he successfully restored its tranquility. This was seen as an appointment of trust as while Napoleon embarked on his summer Italian Campaign, where he ultimately prevailed at the Battle of Marengo, he left Bernadotte not far from Paris with an army. In his farewell note to Bernadotte on his way to Italy, Napoleon wrote: &quot;I am going to fling myself once more into the hazards of war. We do not know how it may turn out. If I fall, you will find yourself with 40,000 men at the gates of Paris. In your hands will be the fate of the Republic.&quot; As Bernadotte was brother-in-law to Joseph and close friends with his other brothers and sisters, Napoleon is thought to have been considering the welfare of his family in the possible event of his death on the battlefield, as well as the future of the country, by leaving his erstwhile rival in a position to seize the reins of government as, of his former rivals, only Bernadotte had the political and military skill and popularity to maintain the Republic.

In 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte proposed that Bernadotte head to New France to serve as governor of Louisiana, which was to be transferred back to French control following the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. In accepting the position, Bernadotte requested additional soldiers, settlers, and funding to support the colony, but Napoleon refused. In response, Bernadotte, declined the posting and instead was named plenipotentiary ambassador to the United States. His posting was cancelled after the Sale of Louisiana.

==Marshal of the French Empire==
On the introduction of the First French Empire, Bernadotte became one of the eighteen Marshals of the Empire, and from June 1804 to September 1805 served as governor of the recently occupied Hanover. In this capacity, as well as during his later command of the army of northern Germany, he created for himself a reputation for independence, incorruptibility, moderation, and administrative ability. Bernadotte&#x27;s rule was popular, and despite the exactions taken from the populace as part of Napoleon&#x27;s policy of making occupations pay for themselves, Hanover&#x27;s economy prospered. Bernadotte extended his protection, and made private contributions to, Gottingen University, befriending many of the professors and other men of learning whom he often had over for dinner and employed to tutor himself and his wife.

During the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte, with his army corps from Hanover formed into the I Corps, commanded the Left Wing of the Grande Armée overseeing Auguste de Marmont&#x27;s II Corps and having the majority of the Bavarian Army attached to his command; some 65,000 men or 1/4th of the Army. Bernadotte was also tasked with assuring France&#x27;s newest ally, the Elector of Bavaria, Maximillian IV Joseph, that the Austrians would be driven from his country.

Bernadotte, with Davout&#x27;s III Corps attached to his command, and the Bavarians, gained a victory over the Austrians driving them out of Munich on 12 October, taking some 3000 prisoners and 19 guns and installing Maximillian Joseph back onto his throne. I Corps then co-operated in the great movement which resulted in the shutting off of Mack in the Battle of Ulm. Bernadotte&#x27;s troops then captured Salzburg on 30 October. In the Battle of Austerlitz (2 December 1805) he was posted with his corps in the center between Soult and Lannes, and contributed to defeating the attempt of the right wing of the allies to outflank the French army. As a reward for his services at Austerlitz, he became the 1st Sovereign Prince of Pontecorvo (5 June 1806), a district in southern Italy formerly subject to the Pope.

During the 1806 campaign against Prussia, Bernadotte was reproached by Napoleon for not participating with his army corps in the battles of Jena and Auerstädt (14 October 1806). Napoleon, on the night of 13 October, thinking he had faced the whole Prussian Army at Jena, sent orders to Davout, through Marshal Berthier, Davout relayed the order to Bernadotte at 0400 on 14 October with the order stating: &quot;If the Prince of Ponte Corvo [Bernadotte] is with you, you may both march together, but the Emperor hopes that &quot;he will be in the position which had been indicated at Dornburg&quot;.&quot; This was in accordance with Bernadotte&#x27;s last set of written orders from 12 October which ordered him and Davout to get across the Prussian line of retreat. In pursuance of these orders, Bernadotte, separately from Davout, left Naumburg at dawn on the morning of the 14th for Dornburg and marched toward Apolda, which he reached by 16:00. Hampered by the very poor state of the roads, and a steep defile within which Dornburg is situated and the narrow bridge which passes over the Saale, that could pass but one artillery piece at a time according to General Dupont, he could not engage in the Battle of Jena, though he effectively compelled the Prussians to retreat from both battlefields by posting his troops on the heights of Apolda.

The defile was such an obstacle that Bernadotte&#x27;s 3rd Infantry division, commanded by Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d&#x27;Erlon, was still in the midst of crossing the bridge well after nightfall, making it unlikely that Bernadotte could have intervened at Auerstädt in any event. He later was accused of deliberately refusing to support Davout, who had unexpectedly encountered the Prussian main army at Auerstädt, out of jealousy, and Napoleon, if reminiscences from St. Helena may be believed, once intended to put Bernadotte before a court-martial. In fact, he did what he had been ordered to do, and more fundamental responsibility for his absence rests upon the ambiguous and indirect orders issued by Berthier and Napoleon&#x27;s unawareness of the Prussian position. Documentary evidence supports Bernadotte&#x27;s assertion that he was ordered to Dornberg as no orders from Napoleon to Bernadotte to march with Davout were ever found in French Imperial Archives while Berthier&#x27;s order of 14 October were confirmed.

After the Battle of Jena, Bernadotte crushed the Prussian Reserve Army, all fresh troops fortified behind a marsh and the River Saale, under Duke Eugen of Württemberg at Halle (17 October 1806), though Imperial Headquarters did not much appreciate this victory. When visiting Halle after the battle, and commenting on the degree of difficulty of storming a fortified position accessible only by a single bridge, Napoleon enigmatically commented &quot;Bernadotte stops at nothing. Someday the Gascon will get caught.&quot; Subsequently, Bernadotte pursued, conjointly with Soult and Murat (known as the &quot;Pursuit of the Three Marshals&quot;), Prussian general Blücher&#x27;s Corps to Lübeck, where his troops stormed the Prussian defenses, taking the city and forcing Blücher&#x27;s capitulation at Ratekau (7 November 1806). When the French forced their way into Lübeck, the city became the target of large-scale looting and rampage by the French soldiers. Bernadotte, struggling desperately to prevent his men from sacking the city, was given six horses from the Council of Lübeck as a token of their appreciation. He also treated with courtesy 1600 Swedish prisoners, under the command of Colonel Count Gustaf Mörner, and allowed them to return to their home country. The impressed Swedes went home with a tale of Bernadotte&#x27;s fairness in maintaining order within the city. Count Mörner would later play a prominent role in the election of Bernadotte as Crown Prince of Sweden.

Thereafter he marched to Poland in command of the French Left Wing, composed of his I Corps and Ney&#x27;s VI Corps. Left unsupported by Ney&#x27;s unexpected movement toward Königsberg, the Russians under Levin August von Bennigsen, passed over to the offensive and attempted to destroy Bernadotte&#x27;s and Ney&#x27;s isolated Corps. Napoleon, having received word of the Russian offensive, gave word to Bernadotte to retreat West as to draw the Russians toward him so that Napoleon could then cut-off and surround the Russians. Bernadotte moved West as ordered, pursued by Bennigsen, where he defeated the numerically superior Russian vanguard at Mohrungen (25 January 1807).

During the battle Bernadotte&#x27;s personal wagon was captured by the Russians and he was accused, by the Cossacks who looted his baggage, of having extorted a large quantity of silver plate from minor German states. This claim is unsubstantiated and contrary to his reputation. He was known throughout the army for his probity and honesty in the conduct of his affairs on campaign and he refrained from the looting and brigandage that many of his fellow marshals engaged in. As a consequence, his table fare was considered poor by his brother marshals and while others dined on fine service and employed chefs, he habitually used his own money to pay for food for his troops, and to give money awards to those who merited recognition. He held his troops to the same high standard; he punished looting and rape severely, and was known to intervene with his sword drawn against those engaged in pillaging, as was the case following the capture of Lübeck.

Due to the capture of a courier carrying the Emperor&#x27;s latest orders, Bernadotte was not informed of a change of strategy to move East toward the rest of the French Army. As a consequence, Bernadotte&#x27;s I Corps was too far away to take part in the Battle of Eylau (7 to 8 February 1807). Napoleon rebuked him for his absence but it became acknowledged that it was not due to Bernadotte, but Berthier&#x27;s carelessness in dispatching the orderly. The Russians resumed the offensive that summer and Bernadotte was attacked by, and defeated, a strong Prussian Corps at Spanden, preserving the French bridgehead over the Pasłęka, where he was nearly killed when a spent ball struck him in the neck. Due to this near fatal wound, Bernadotte was invalided to the rear and missed the remainder of the Polish Campaign.

After the Peace of Tilsit, on 14 July 1807, he became governor of the Hanseatic towns, where he once again proved his administrative and diplomatic abilities and was well-liked. He was to direct the expedition against Sweden, via the Danish islands, but the plan came to naught because of the want of transports and the defection of the Spanish contingent, which went back to Spain to fight against Napoleon at the start of the Peninsular War. Pursuant to the projected invasion of Sweden, and by virtue of Denmark becoming an ally of France in 1808, Bernadotte found himself de facto head of a French occupation of Denmark. He maintained strict discipline of his troops and his good treatment of the Danes made him popular with the populace and Danish Royal Family. Upon his departure from Denmark he was one of few Frenchmen of the period to be awarded the Order of the Elephant.

During Bernadotte&#x27;s time as governor of the Hanseatic cities, the Abdications of Bayonne occurred, an event that triggered the Peninsular War that would play so large a role in Napoleon&#x27;s defeat. For a time Napoleon considered the notion of placing Bernadotte on the Spanish throne; going so far as to hint at it in a letter to him. Bernadotte made it known to Napoleon that he did not want the Spanish Crown. Joseph Bonaparte, Bernadotte&#x27;s friend and brother-in-law, was chosen instead. It was not the first, or last time, that Napoleon thought of placing Bernadotte on a foreign throne. Indeed, Napoleon on several occasions, both during his days as First Consul and then as Emperor, thought of naming Bernadotte (Napoleon also considered Murat) as his successor by adoption. Despite their rivalry, Napoleon thought Bernadotte alone had the popularity, administrative and military skill to safeguard the Empire he had built. The birth of the King of Rome put an end to Napoleon&#x27;s need for an heir. Ironically, Bernadotte eventually wore a crown, not through the auspices of Napoleon, but as an enemy of France.

Recalled to Germany to assist in the new war between France and Austria, he received the command of the 9th Corps, which was mainly composed of Saxons. Further difficulties with Berthier, and a saddling with ill-prepared Saxons, combined with an illness, compelled Bernadotte to beg for release from service. Bernadotte wrote to Napoleon that &quot;I see my efforts perpetually paralyzed by a hidden force over which I can not prevail.&quot; Napoleon disregarded these appeals and Bernadotte proceeded with the campaign, commanding mostly foreign troops with few French troops under his command.
At the Battle of Wagram (5 July 1809), he entered battle with his Saxon corps, to which the division of Dupas was attached and which formed his reserve. Resting on the French Left, Bernadotte&#x27;s corps was battered during the night but resisted the full fury of the Austrian attack facing superior numbers. At a critical moment he ordered Dupas forward to his support; the latter replied that he had orders from the emperor to remain where he was. Having been badly mauled, and fully exposed ahead of the main French line, IX Corps withdrew from the village of Aderklaa against Napoleon&#x27;s orders. On the second day of battle, 6 July 1809, IX Corps, having been mauled the night before, wherein Bernadotte struggled to rally his demoralized Saxons, was attacked by two Austrian corps, as part of Archduke Charles&#x27;s effort to break the French line. This time Bernadotte&#x27;s depleted forceshe had only 6,000 infantry leftbroke and fled (Bernadotte&#x27;s Corps was not the only one to break that day; Masséna&#x27;s troops were also routed by the attack). The routed Saxons retreated in disorder toward Raasdorf as Bernadotte attempted to rally his men, where he encountered Napoleon. IX Corps rallied and played a further role in the battle. Rumors that Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command on the spot at Raasdorf have long been the stuff of legend, but are not verified. After the battle, Bernadotte complained to Napoleon for having, in violation of all military rules, ordered Dupas to act independently of his command, and for having thereby caused great loss of life to the Saxons, and tendered his resignation. Napoleon accepted after he had become aware of an order of the day issued by Bernadotte in which he gave the Saxons credit for their courage in terms inconsistent with the emperor&#x27;s official bulletin. Accounts of Bernadotte&#x27;s role at Wagram are contradictory. While it is true that IX Corps broke on 6 July, as did other French formations, they later rallied and played a part in the victory. Moreover, Bernadotte fought with exceptional personal courage, at the head of his troops, and narrowly avoided death when attacked by Austrian cavalry. It is likely that IX Corps&#x27; poor performance would have been forgotten, and Bernadotte would have retained his command, had he never published the controversial Order of the Day. His praise for the Saxons, as well as his mild and courteous treatment of them while under his command, was never forgotten by the Saxon officers and this would later have disastrous consequences for the French when a whole Saxon division defected to Bernadotte&#x27;s Army of the North during a key moment of the Battle of Leipzig.

With Bernadotte having returned to Paris, the Walcheren Campaign (July 1809) caused the French ministry in the absence of the emperor to entrust him with the defense of Antwerp with both regular French and Dutch troops along with the National Guard. Bernadotte took command of a chaotic situation wherein troops from all over the Empire and its vassal states, and raw conscripts, were sent to Holland under divided command. He re-organized and trained his forces, named by the Emperor as the Army of Antwerp, by instilling discipline in old soldiers too long at the depots and teaching raw conscripts their trade. Everywhere he instilled a fighting spirit, making an army out of a mob, and thus he rapidly brought the defenses of Antwerp to a high order of readiness. With Antwerp bristling with cannon and numerous defenders, and with the Army of Antwerp whipped into fighting shape, the British, vexed by poor leadership and with half the army immobilized with fever thanks to the insalubrious islands upon which they were quartered, realized that it was no longer possible to close the Scheldt, or take Antwerp, and they withdrew their forces. In a proclamation issued to his troops at Antwerp he made an implied charge against Napoleon of having neglected to prepare the proper means of defense for the Belgian coast. A displeased Napoleon relieved Bernadotte of command of his ad hoc army, and ordered his return to Paris to leave for Catalonia and take command of the Army there. Refusing to comply with the order, he was summoned to Vienna, and after an interview with Napoleon at Schönbrunn accepted the general government of the Roman departments.

==Offer of the Swedish throne==

In 1810, Bernadotte was about to enter his new post as governor of Rome when he was unexpectedly elected the heir-presumptive to King Charles XIII of Sweden. The problem of Charles&#x27;s successor had been acute almost from the time he had ascended the throne a year earlier. He was 61 years old and in poor health. He was also childless; Queen Charlotte had given birth to two children who had died in infancy, and there was no prospect of her bearing another child. Soon after his coronation, the king had adopted a Danish prince, Charles August, who had died just a few months after his arrival. Despite the fact that Napoleon favored his ally Danish King Frederick VI, Danish Prince Frederick Christian initially had the most support to become the Swedish Crown Prince.

The political situation internally and externally for Sweden meant that selecting a foreign king was an attractive option. Sweden wanted to strengthen its relationship with Napoleon for militaristic reasons and so sought to select a king who would be able to attract Napoleon&#x27;s support. The Swedish court initially sounded out the emperor for his preferences on candidates for crown prince, whereupon Napoleon made it clear he preferred his adopted stepson Eugène de Beauharnais, or one of his nephews or brothers. The Swedish envoys did not accept Eugène as a candidate. Baron Lagerbielke, the Swedish envoy in Paris, reported to Stockholm that Eugène was &quot;gentle and good,&quot; &quot;but he does not seem to be a man of strong character; and, although he had had great opportunities, he does not appear to have developed any distinguishing talents.&quot; Also, Eugène, serving as viceroy in Italy, did not wish to convert to Lutheranism, a prerequisite for accepting the Swedish offer. Moreover, none of Napoleon&#x27;s brothers were interested in going to Sweden and his nephews were too young, as the Swedes did not want the hazards of minority rule in the event King Charles died prematurely. The matter was decided by an obscure Swedish courtier, Baron Karl Otto Mörner (nephew of Count Gustav Mörner, the commander of the Swedish force captured by Bernadotte at Lübeck), who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte. Bernadotte communicated Mörner&#x27;s offer to Napoleon who at first treated the situation as an absurdity, but later came around to the idea and while adopting a public attitude of indifference, quietly lent support to Bernadotte&#x27;s candidacy both financially and diplomatically.

Although the Swedish government, amazed at Mörner&#x27;s , at once placed him under arrest on his return to Sweden, the candidature of Bernadotte gradually gained favour and on 21 August 1810 he was elected by the Riksdag of the Estates in Örebro to be the new crown prince, and was subsequently made Generalissimus of the Swedish Armed Forces by the King. Several factors benefitted Bernadotte&#x27;s election. Being foreign was, although problematic, also to his favour due to geopolitical factors and the internal situation at the time. One benefit was his (presumed) close ties to French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, with whom a relationship would provide military backing as the intention at the time was to reacquire Finland. The current King, Charles XIII, viewed Napoleon in a more positive way than Gustav IV Adolf had, who had held him in very ill regard. Another point in favour was that a large part of the Swedish Army, anticipating conflict with Russia, were in favour of electing a soldier. Also, Bernadotte was personally popular, owing to the kindness he had shown to the Swedish prisoners in Lübeck and his reputation as the well-liked governor of the Hanseatic Cities from 1807 to 1809; as many Swedish merchants had operated under his auspices. Finally, Bernadotte had no qualms about converting to Lutheranism, recalling the conversion of Henry IV for the benefit of France with whom he felt a kinship as both hailed from Pau, nor converting his son Oscar (though his wife Désirée never did renounce Catholicism).

Before freeing Bernadotte from his allegiance to France, Napoleon asked him to agree never to take up arms against France. Bernadotte refused to make any such agreement, upon the ground that his obligations to Sweden would not allow it; Napoleon exclaimed &quot;Go, and let our destinies be accomplished&quot; and signed the act of emancipation unconditionally. Many were also optimistic that Sweden would recover Finland under Charles John. The Swedish crown prince even unsuccessfully sought Napoleon&#x27;s support to assist Sweden in conquering Norway.

==Crown Prince and Regent==

On 2 November 1810 Bernadotte made his solemn entry into Stockholm, and on 5 November he received the homage of the Riksdag of the Estates, and he was adopted by King Charles XIII under the name of &quot;Charles John&quot; (Karl Johan). At the same time, he converted from Roman Catholicism to the Lutheranism of the Swedish court.

The new Crown Prince was very soon the most popular and most powerful man in Sweden and quickly impressed his adoptive father. Following his first meeting with his new heir, Charles XIII (who had initially opposed Bernadotte&#x27;s candidacy) remarked to his aide-de-camp count Charles de Suremain &quot;My dear Suremain, I have gambled heavily, and I believe that after all I have won.&quot; He also made himself well liked by Queen Charlotte, who regarded him a &quot;gentleman in every sense of the word&quot;, and established a net of contact within the Swedish aristocracy, befriending in particular the Brahe family through his favorite Magnus Brahe and countess Aurora Wilhelmina Brahe, whose cousin Mariana Koskull became his lover.

The infirmity of the old King and the dissensions in the Privy Council of Sweden placed the government, and especially the control of foreign policy, entirely in his hands. Amongst the first of Charles John&#x27;s acts as Crown Prince was to address the dire state of the Swedish economy. The Swedish economy was in shambles after years of mismanagement since the reign of Gustav III and aggravated during the reign of his son Gustav IV Adolf. The economic turmoil had been caused, in part, by the debts accrued from Gustav III&#x27;s Russian War, in part to the failure of several of Gustav IV Adolf&#x27;s well intentioned economic reforms (Gustav IV Adolf was rather more successful in his agrarian reforms) and the costs of the more recent wars against France and Russia. Under Gustav IV Adolf genuine attempts at economic reform, including paying down the national debt by some 700,000 Riksdalers in the first years of his active reign, and revitalizing the currency, met with limited success.

Such measures were undermined by his other policies. Gustav IV Adolf&#x27;s personal dislike of the Riksdag, which had the power to raise taxes, led to his refusal to call them into session after 1800, crippling his attempts to raise state revenues. Gustav IV Adolf&#x27;s foreign policy plunged Sweden into disastrous (and expensive) wars against France and Russia. The cost of years of war, several poor harvests in the years between 1798 and 1809, the ineptitude of his ministers in carrying out fiscal reforms, and the loss of the tax base of Finland had ballooned Sweden&#x27;s national debt. The impending demands of Napoleon to adhere to the Continental System forecasted even greater difficulties. Charles John immediately began making reforms, and used his sizable fortune, accrued honestly during his time as French Marshal, to pay off much of the debt, and to stabilize the economy by both grants and via a loan to the state of £300,000 sterling at five percent interest. Charles John also purchased back from the French private estates that had been confiscated during the occupation of Swedish Pomerania from 1808 to 1810 and returned them to their original Swedish and German owners.

The keynote of his foreign and domestic policy was maintenance of Swedish independence of action, often in the face of French demands, and the acquisition of Norway as a compensation for the loss of Finland. Many Swedes expected him to reconquer Finland, which had been ceded to Russia. The Crown Prince was aware of its difficulty for reasons of the desperate situation of the state finance and the reluctance of the Finnish people to return to Sweden. Even if Finland was regained, he thought, it would put Sweden into a new cycle of conflicts with a powerful neighbor because there was no guarantee Russia would accept the loss as final. Therefore, he made up his mind to make a united Scandinavian peninsula, which was easier to defend, by taking Norway (intentionally without the ancient and remote provinces of Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands) from Denmark and uniting her to Sweden. He tried to divert public opinion from Finland to Norway, by arguing that to create a compact peninsula, with sea for its natural boundary, was to inaugurate an era of peace, and that waging war with Russia would lead to ruinous consequences.

Soon after Charles John&#x27;s arrival in Sweden, Napoleon compelled him to accede to the Continental System and declare war against Great Britain; otherwise, Sweden would have to face the determination of France, Denmark and Russia. This demand would mean a hard blow to the national economy and the Swedish population. Sweden reluctantly declared war against the UK, which was treated by both countries as merely nominal, although Swedish imports of British goods decreased from £4,871 million in 1810 to £523 million in the following year.

In January 1812, French troops suddenly invaded Swedish Pomerania and the island of Rügen. Officially, the French claimed that Sweden had repeatedly violated the Continental System and that the occupation of Stralsund and Swedish Pomerania was closing an entrepôt for illegal British goods. Napoleon, before marching to Moscow, also had to secure his rear and dared not allow a Swedish continental foothold behind him as he did not trust Charles John. Charles John believed that Napoleon scheduled the occupation to occur on the Crown Prince&#x27;s birthday, and ordered Charles John&#x27;s old rival Marshal Davout to execute the operation, as a personal insult, adding another dimension of personal enmity to the incident. As a result, the initially amicable relationship which Charles John had with Napoleon, following his election as Crown Prince, soon changed because of the invasion. The invasion was a clear violation of international law as well as an act of war and public opinion in Sweden was outraged. Moreover, it antagonized the pro-French faction at the Swedish court. Thereafter, the Crown Prince declared the neutrality of Sweden and opened negotiations with the UK and Russia.

In 1812, he allied Sweden with its traditional enemy Russia, and sought to make peace with the United Kingdom with whom Sweden was technically at war. Charles John&#x27;s personal diplomacy served as the bridge between Russia and the UK as on 18 July 1812 the Treaty of Örebro formally ended the wars between Britain and Sweden and Britain and Russia and formed an alliance between Russia, Britain, and Sweden; creating the Sixth Coalition. The treaty stipulated that Sweden would land an army of no less than 25,000 on the continent for the express purpose of fighting France, as well as liberating Swedish Pomerania, and in exchange, Russia and the UK would diplomatically and militarily support the cession of Norway from the doggedly French-allied Denmark to Sweden. Throughout summer and fall 1812, Bernadotte sought to add more allies to the Coalition, and negotiated a treaty with the Spanish Supreme Central Junta against his own brother-in-law who was currently the French-backed King of Spain. Although Napoleon had forced Frederick William III to break off relations with Sweden, Charles John corresponded with the King of Prussia, encouraging him to renounce the forced alliance with France and join the Coalition. Following the Convention of Tauroggen, which broke the Prussian/French Alliance, Frederick Wilhelm signed the Treaty of Kalisz with Russia, and then a separate peace treaty with Sweden, on the basis of Prussian recognition of the Norwegian cession to Sweden, in exchange for Swedish Pomerania, thus formally joining the Coalition in spring 1813.

After the defeats at Lützen (2 May 1813) and Bautzen (21 May 1813), it was the Swedish Crown Prince who put fresh fighting spirit into the Allies; and at the conference of Trachenberg he drew up the Trachenberg Plan, the general plan for the campaign which began after the expiration of the Truce of Pläswitz.

Charles John, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Army, successfully defended the approaches to Berlin and was victorious in battle against Oudinot in August and against Ney in September at the Battles of Großbeeren and Dennewitz. Bernadotte&#x27;s Army of the North would continue to guard Berlin and keep watch on Davout&#x27;s forces in Hamburg while the Allies, in accordance with the plan conceived at Trachenberg, maneuvered toward Napoleon&#x27;s army at Leipzig. With the other Allied armies engaged in battle on 17 October, Bernadotte&#x27;s army finally crossed the Elbe and joined in the Battle of Leipzig on 19 October. His fresh troops, reinforced by 30,000 Prussians, joined the fray against the already battered French lines where Swedish forces entered battle in numbers for the first time in the campaign. At a critical moment entire Saxon regiments went over to his army in response to a proclamation released a week prior in which Bernadotte invited the Saxons to join their old commander in defeating Napoleon. The Army of the North committed the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; on the already depleted French and Bernadotte was the first of the Allied sovereigns to enter Leipzig.

After the Battle of Leipzig he went his own way, determined at all hazards to cripple Denmark and to secure Norway, defeating the Danes in a relatively quick campaign. His efforts culminated in the favourable Treaty of Kiel, which transferred Norway to Swedish control.

The Norwegians rejected Swedish control. They declared independence, adopted a liberal constitution and elected Danish crown prince Christian Frederick to the throne. The ensuing war was swiftly won by Sweden under Charles John&#x27;s generalship. The military operations in 1814 were to be Sweden&#x27;s last war to this day. Charles John could have named his terms to Norway, but in a key concession accepted the Constitution of Norway and its own political autonomy. This paved the way for Norway to enter a personal union with Sweden later that year.

During the period of the Allied invasion of France in the winter and spring of 1814, when it was unclear who would rule France after the war, the Russian Tsar Alexander I, with support from French liberals like Benjamin Constant and Madame de Staël, advocated placing Charles John on the French throne in place of Napoleon. He would rule France as a Constitutional Monarch and leave Oscar as Regent in Sweden and Norway. Ultimately the British and Austrians vetoed the idea, and the Allies agreed that if Napoleon were to be deposed, the only acceptable alternative was the restoration of the House of Bourbon.

==King of Sweden and Norway==


Charles John had been regent and &quot;de facto&quot; head of state upon his arrival, and took an increasing role in government from 1812 onward, with Charles XIII reduced to a mute witness in government councils following a stroke.

Upon Charles&#x27;s death on 5 February 1818, Charles John ascended the throne. He was initially popular in both countries. The democratic process and forces steadily matured under the King&#x27;s restrained executive power.

The foreign policy applied by Charles John in the post-Napoleonic era was characterized by the maintenance of balance between the Great Powers and non-involvement into conflicts that took place outside of the Scandinavian peninsula. It made a sharp contrast with Sweden&#x27;s previous hegemonic expansionism resulting in uninterrupted wars with neighboring countries for centuries, and he successfully kept his kingdoms in a state of peace from 1814 until his death. He was especially concerned about the conflict between the UK and Russia. In 1834, when the relationship between the two countries strained regarding the Near East Crisis, he sent memoranda to British and Russian governments and proclaimed neutrality in advance. It is pointed out as the origin of Swedish neutrality.
His domestic policy particularly focused on promotion of economy and investment in social overhead capital, and the long peace since 1814 led to an increased prosperity for the country. During his long reign of 26 years (34 years if one counts his time as regent from 1810 to 1818), the population of the Kingdom was so increased that the inhabitants of Sweden alone became equal in number to those of Sweden and Finland before the latter province was torn from the former, the national debt was paid off, a civil and a penal code were proposed for promulgation, education was promoted, agriculture, commerce, and manufactures prospered, and the means of internal communication were increased.

On the other hand, radical in his youth, his views had veered steadily rightward over the years, and by the time he ascended the throne he was an ultra-conservative. His autocratic methods, particularly his censorship of the press, were very unpopular, especially after 1823. His dynasty faced little danger, as the Swedes and the Norwegians alike were proud of a monarch with a good European reputation.
He also faced challenges in Norway. The Norwegian constitution gave the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, more power than any legislature in Europe. While Charles John had the power of absolute veto in Sweden, he only had a suspensive veto in Norway. He demanded that the Storting give him the power of absolute veto, but was forced to back down. Charles John&#x27;s difficult relationship with Norway was also demonstrated by the Storting&#x27;s unwillingness to grant funds for the construction of a Royal Palace in the Norwegian capital Oslo. The construction began in 1825, but the Storting halted the funding after the costly foundation was laid and demanded that the appointed architect, Hans Linstow, construct a simpler palace. This was seen by many as a protest against unnecessary spending and the king&#x27;s authority. The palace itself was not completed until 1849, long after the death of Charles John, and was inaugurated by Oscar I. The main street in Oslo, &quot;Slottsgate&quot;n, would later be named after Charles John as Karl Johans gate.

His popularity decreased for a time in the 1830s, culminating in the Rabulist riots after the Lèse-majesté conviction of the journalist Magnus Jacob Crusenstolpe, and some calls for his abdication. Charles John survived the abdication controversy and he went on to have his silver jubilee, which was celebrated with great enthusiasm on 18 February 1843. He reigned as King of Sweden and Norway from 5 February 1818 until his death on 8 March 1844.
==Death==
On 26 January 1844, his 81st birthday, Charles John was found unconscious in his chambers having suffered a stroke. While he regained consciousness, he never fully recovered and died on the afternoon of 8 March. On his deathbed, he was heard to say:

His remains were interred after a state funeral in Stockholm&#x27;s Riddarholmen Church. He was succeeded by his only son, Oscar I.

==Fictional portrayals==

Louis-Émile Vanderburch and Ferdinand Langlé&#x27;s 1833 play (&quot;The Bedfellow&quot;) depicts Bernadotte as King of Sweden; an old grenadier claims that, as a young man, Bernadotte received a tattoo of a scandalous republican motto: either (&quot;Death to kings&quot;), or (&quot;Death to tyrants&quot;), or (&quot;Death to the king&quot;). The tattoo is finally revealed to read (&quot;Long live the Republic&quot;) and a Phrygian cap: a highly ironic image and text for the skin of a king. This play was so popular that the idea that King Charles XIV John had a tattoo reading &quot;Death to kings&quot; is often repeated as fact, although there is no basis to it. For reasons of discretion, he publicly proclaimed himself in 1797 &quot;a Republican both by principle and conviction&quot; who would “to the moment of my death, oppose all Royalists and enemies to the Directory&quot;.

Désirée Clary&#x27;s relationships with Bonaparte and Bernadotte were the subject of the novel &quot;Désirée&quot; by Annemarie Selinko. The novel was filmed as &quot;Désirée&quot; in 1954, with Marlon Brando as Napoleon, Jean Simmons as Désirée, and Michael Rennie as Bernadotte.

Bernadotte is a primary supporting character in the historical fiction novel by &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestselling author Allison Pataki &quot;A Queen&#x27;s Fortune: A Novel of Désirée, Napoleon, and the Dynasty that outlasted the Empire,&quot; that tells the life story of his wife (and Queen of Sweden and Norway) Désirée Clary.

<text>Esperanto symbols, primarily the Esperanto flag, have seen much consistency over the time of Esperanto&#x27;s existence (namely in the consistent usage of the colour green), though a few variations in exact flag patterning and symbology exist.

The main flag of Esperanto, featuring the  (&#x27;Green Star&#x27;), was adopted in 1905 for use as a symbol of mutual recognition among Esperantists, and is used by most Esperantists. As an alternative to the flag, the &quot;jubilea simbolo&quot; (&#x27;jubilee symbol&#x27;) was proposed in 1987.

== History ==

=== &quot;Verda Stelo&quot; ===

Since the earliest days of Esperanto, the colour green has been used as a symbol of mutual recognition, and it appears prominently in all Esperanto symbols. In a letter to &quot;The British Esperantist&quot; in 1911, L. L. Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, wrote: &quot;It seems to me, that my attention was drawn to the color green by Mr. Richard H. Geoghegan and from that time I began to publish all of my works with green covers . . . Looking at one of my pamphlets that I had entirely by chance printed with a green cover, he pointed out that this was the color of his homeland, Ireland; at that time it came to me, that we could certainly look at that color as a symbol of HOPE. About the five-pointed star, it seems to me, that at first Mr. de Beaufront had it imprinted on his grammar [of Esperanto]. I liked that and I adopted it as a symbol. Afterward by association of ideas, the star appeared with a green color.&quot;

The &quot;Verda Stelo&quot; was first proposed in an 1892 article in La Esperantisto for use as a symbol of mutual recognition among Esperantists. The flag was created by the Esperanto Club of Boulogne-sur-Mer, initially for their own use, but was adopted as the flag of the worldwide Esperanto movement by a decision of the first World Esperanto Congress, which took place in 1905 in that town.

=== Other proposed flags and symbols ===

In 1905, delegates to the first conference of Esperantists at Boulogne-sur-Mer, unanimously approved a version differing from the modern only by the superimposition of an &quot;E&quot; over the green star. Other variants include that for Christian Esperantists, with a white Christian cross superimposed upon the green star, and that for Leftists, with the color of the field changed from green to red.

Some Esperanto speakers consider the traditional flag too nationalistic for an international language, so many organizations no longer recommend its use and, instead, use the jubilea simbolo (&quot;jubilee symbol&quot;, two green &quot;E&quot;s facing each other—or alternatively a Latin-alphabet &quot;E&quot; facing a Cyrillic-alphabet &quot;Э&quot;, the first letter of &quot;Эсперанто&quot;, the Russian name for Esperanto—on a white field). This symbol was created in 1987 by a Brazilian Esperantist to mark the centenary of the creation of Esperanto.

== Design of the &quot;Verda Stelo&quot; ==

The Esperanto flag is composed of a green background with a white square (canton) in the upper lefthand corner, which in turn contains a green star. The green field symbolizes hope, the white symbolizes peace and neutrality, and the five-pointed star represents the five continents (Europe, America, Asia, Oceania, Africa). 

By recommendation of the board of the Universal Esperanto Association, the flag should have the following proportions: The ratio of the width of the flag to the height of the flag to a side of the white square should be 3 to 2 to 1. The ratio of a side of the white square to the radius of a circle enclosing the star should be 10 to 3.5.

== In popular culture ==
Most Esperantists continue to hold the &quot;verda stelo&quot; dear as a symbol of international or supranational solidarity (with the &quot;jubilea simbolo&quot; jokingly called &quot;la melono&quot; (&#x27;the melon&#x27;) by some), though many also regard the preference of one symbol over another as a purely personal choice. At most Esperanto congresses, the flag, the star, and the &quot;jubilea simbolo&quot; can all be seen in use on displays or being worn as badges. Sometimes, Esperanto travelers will display the flag, wear a badge with one of the above symbols, or even wear green clothes, to make themselves known to other Esperanto speakers.

On December 15, 2009, the &quot;Verda Stelo&quot; flew on the Google home search page &quot;Google&quot; logo to mark L. L. Zamenhof&#x27;s 150th birthday. The flag flew on a flagstaff consisting of the &quot;L&quot; in the search-company&#x27;s name.
