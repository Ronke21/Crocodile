<text>An error (from the Latin , meaning &#x27;to wander&#x27;) is an inaccurate or incorrect action, thought, or judgement.

In statistics, &quot;error&quot; refers to the difference between the value which has been computed and the correct value. An error could result in failure or in a deviation from the intended performance or behavior.

==Human behavior==
One reference differentiates between &quot;error&quot; and &quot;mistake&quot; as follows:
In human behavior the norms or expectations for behavior or its consequences can be derived from the intention of the actor or from the expectations of other individuals or from a social grouping or from social norms. (See deviance.) Gaffes and faux pas can be labels for certain instances of this kind of error. More serious departures from social norms carry labels such as misbehavior and labels from the legal system, such as misdemeanor and crime. Departures from norms connected to religion can have other labels, such as sin.

=== Language ===

An individual language user&#x27;s deviations from standard language norms in grammar, pronunciation and orthography are sometimes referred to as errors. However, in light of the role of language usage in everyday social class distinctions, many feel that linguistics should restrain itself from such prescriptivist judgments to avoid reinforcing dominant class value claims about what linguistic forms should and should not be used. One may distinguish various kinds of linguistic errors – some, such as aphasia or speech disorders, where the user is unable to say what they intend to, are generally considered errors, while cases where natural, intended speech is non-standard (as in vernacular dialects), are considered legitimate speech in scholarly linguistics, but might be considered errors in prescriptivist contexts. See also Error analysis (linguistics).


===Gaffe ===
A gaffe is usually made in a social environment and may come from saying something that may be true but inappropriate. It may also be an erroneous attempt to reveal a truth. Gaffes can be malapropisms, grammatical errors or other verbal and gestural weaknesses or revelations through body language. Actually revealing factual or social truth through words or body language, however, can commonly result in embarrassment or, when the gaffe has negative connotations, friction between people involved.

Philosophers and psychologists interested in the nature of the gaffe include Sigmund Freud (Freudian slip) and Gilles Deleuze. Deleuze, in his &quot;The Logic of Sense&quot;, places the gaffe in a developmental process that can culminate in stuttering.

Sportswriters and journalists commonly use &quot;gaffe&quot; to refer to any kind of mistake, e.g. a dropped ball (baseball error) by a player in a baseball game.

==Science and engineering==

In statistics, an &quot;error&quot; (or &quot;residual&quot;) is not a &quot;mistake&quot; but rather a difference between a computed, estimated, or measured value and the accepted true, specified, or theoretically correct value.

In science and engineering in general, an error is defined as a difference between the desired and actual performance or behavior of a system or object. This definition is the basis of operation for many types of control systems, in which error is defined as the difference between a set point and the process value. An example of this would be the thermostat in a home heating system – the operation of the heating equipment is controlled by the difference (the error) between the thermostat setting and the sensed air temperature. Another approach is related to considering a scientific hypothesis as true or false, giving birth to two types of errors: Type 1 and Type 2. The first one is when a true hypothesis is considered false, while the second is the reverse (a false one is considered true).

Engineers seek to design devices, machines and systems and in such a way as to mitigate or preferably avoid the effects of error, whether unintentional or not. Such errors in a system can be latent design errors that may go unnoticed for years, until the right set of circumstances arises that cause them to become active. Other errors in engineered systems can arise due to human error, which includes cognitive bias. Human factors engineering is often applied to designs in an attempt to minimize this type of error by making systems more forgiving or error-tolerant.

(In computational mechanics, when solving a system such as &quot;Ax&quot; = &quot;b&quot; there is a distinction between the &quot;error&quot; – the inaccuracy in &quot;x&quot; – and residual – the inaccuracy in &quot;Ax&quot;.)

A notable result of Engineering and Scientific errors that occurred in history is the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, which caused a nuclear meltdown in the City of Chernobyl in present-day Ukraine, and is used as a case study in many Engineering/Science research 

==Numerical analysis==

Numerical analysis provides a variety of techniques to represent (store) and compute approximations to mathematical numerical values. Errors arise from a trade-off between efficiency (space and computation time) and precision, which is limited anyway, since (using common floating-point arithmetic) only a finite amount of values can be represented exactly. The discrepancy between the exact mathematical value and the stored/computed value is called the approximation error.

==Cybernetics==
In applying corrections to the trajectory or course being steered, cybernetics can be seen as the most general approach to error and its correction for the achievement of any goal. The term was suggested by Norbert Wiener to describe a new science of control and information in the animal and the machine. Wiener&#x27;s early work was on noise.

The cybernetician Gordon Pask held that the error that drives a servomechanism can be seen as a difference between a pair of analogous concepts in a servomechanism: the current state and the goal state. Later he suggested error can also be seen as an innovation or a contradiction depending on the context and perspective of interacting (observer) participants. The founder of management cybernetics, 
Stafford Beer, applied these ideas most notably in his viable system model.

==Biology==

In biology, an &quot;error&quot; is said to occur when perfect fidelity is lost in the copying of information. For example, in an asexually reproducing species, an error (or mutation) has occurred for each DNA nucleotide that differs between the child and the parent. Many of these mutations can be harmful, but unlike other types of errors, some are neutral or even beneficial. Mutations are an important force driving evolution. Mutations that make organisms more adapted to their environment increase in the population through natural selection as organisms with favorable mutations have more offspring.

==Philately==

In philately, an &quot;error&quot; refers to a postage stamp or piece of postal stationery that exhibits a printing or production mistake that differentiates it from a normal specimen or from the intended result. Examples are stamps printed in the wrong color or missing one or more colors, printed with a vignette inverted in relation to its frame, produced without any perforations on one or more sides when the normal stamps are perforated, or printed on the wrong type of paper. Legitimate errors must always be produced and sold unintentionally. Such errors may or may not be scarce or rare. A &quot;design error&quot; may refer to a mistake in the design of the stamp, such as a mislabeled subject, even if there are no printing or production mistakes.

==Law==

In appellate review, error typically refers to mistakes made by a trial court or some other court of first instance in applying the law in a particular legal case. This may involve such mistakes as improper admission of evidence, inappropriate instructions to the jury, or applying the wrong standard of proof.

==Stock market==

A stock market error is a stock market transaction that was done due to an error, due to human failure or computer errors.

==Governmental policy==
Within United States government intelligence agencies, such as Central Intelligence Agency agencies, &quot;error&quot; refers to &quot;intelligence error&quot;, as previous assumptions that used to exist at a senior intelligence level within senior intelligence agencies, but has since been disproven, and is sometimes eventually listed as unclassified, and therefore more available to the public and citizenry of the United States. The Freedom of information act provides American citizenry with a means to read intelligence reports that were mired in error. Per United States Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s website (as of August, 2008) intelligence error is described as:

&quot;Intelligence errors are factual inaccuracies in analysis resulting from poor or missing data; intelligence failure is systemic organizational surprise resulting from incorrect, missing, discarded, or inadequate hypotheses.&quot;

==Numismatics==
In numismatics, an &quot;error&quot; refers to a coin or medal that has a minting mistake, similar to errors found in philately. Because the U.S. Bureau of the Mint keeps a careful eye on all potential errors, errors on U.S. coins are very few and usually very scarce. Examples of numismatic errors: extra metal attached to a coin, a clipped coin caused by the coin stamp machine stamping a second coin too early, double stamping of a coin. A coin that has been overdated, e.g. 1942/41, is also considered an error.

==Linguistics==
In applied linguistics, an error is an unintended deviation from the immanent rules of a language variety made by a second language learner. Such errors result from the learner&#x27;s lack of knowledge of the correct rules of the target language variety. A significant distinction is generally made between &quot;errors&quot; (systematic deviations) and &quot;mistakes&quot; (speech performance errors) which are not treated the same from a linguistic viewpoint. The study of learners&#x27; errors has been the main area of investigation by linguists in the history of second-language acquisition research.

==Medicine==
A medical error is a preventable adverse effect of care (&quot;iatrogenesis&quot;), whether or not it is evident or harmful to the patient. This might include an inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis or treatment of a disease, injury, syndrome, behavior, infection, or other ailment.

The word &quot;error&quot; in medicine is used as a label for nearly all of the clinical incidents that harm patients. Medical errors are often described as human errors in healthcare. Whether the label is a medical error or human error, one definition used in medicine says that it occurs when a healthcare provider chooses an inappropriate method of care, improperly executes an appropriate method of care, or reads the wrong CT scan. It has been said that the definition should be the subject of more debate. For instance, studies of hand hygiene compliance of physicians in an ICU show that compliance varied from 19% to 85%. The deaths that result from infections caught as a result of treatment providers improperly executing an appropriate method of care by not complying with known safety standards for hand hygiene are difficult to regard as innocent accidents or mistakes.

There are many types of medical error, from minor to major, and causality is often poorly determined.

There are many taxonomies for classifying medical errors.

<text>In telecommunications, a burst error or error burst is a contiguous sequence of symbols, received over a communication channel, such that the first and last symbols are in error and there exists no contiguous subsequence of &quot;m&quot; correctly received symbols within the error burst. The integer parameter &quot;m&quot; is referred to as the &quot;guard band&quot; of the error burst. The last symbol in a burst and the first symbol in the following burst are accordingly separated by &quot;m&quot; correct symbols or more. The parameter &quot;m&quot; should be specified when describing an error burst.

==Channel model==

The Gilbert–Elliott model is a simple channel model introduced by Edgar Gilbert and E. O. Elliott that is widely used for describing burst error patterns in transmission channels and enables simulations of the digital error performance of communications links. It is based on a Markov chain with two states &quot;G&quot; (for good or gap) and &quot;B&quot; (for bad or burst). In state &quot;G&quot; the probability of transmitting a bit correctly is &quot;k&quot; and in state &quot;B&quot; it is &quot;h&quot;. Usually, it is assumed that &quot;k&quot; = 1. Gilbert provided equations for deriving the other three parameters (&quot;G&quot; and &quot;B&quot; state transition probabilities and &quot;h&quot;) from a given success/failure sequence. In his example, the sequence was too short to correctly find &quot;h&quot; (a negative probability was found) and so Gilbert assumed that &quot;h&quot; = 0.5.

<text>In computing and telecommunications, an escape character is a character that invokes an alternative interpretation on the following characters in a character sequence. An escape character is a particular case of metacharacters. Generally, the judgement of whether something is an escape character or not depends on the context.

In the telecommunications field, escape characters are used to indicate that the following characters are encoded differently. This is used to alter control characters that would otherwise be noticed and acted on by the underlying telecommunications hardware, such as illegal characters. In this context, the use of escape characters is often referred to as quoting.

==Definition==
An escape character may not have its own meaning, so all escape sequences are of two or more characters.

Escape characters are part of the syntax for many programming languages, data formats, and communication protocols. For a given alphabet an escape character&#x27;s purpose is to start character sequences (so named escape sequences), which have to be interpreted differently from the same characters occurring without the prefixed escape character.

The functions of escape sequences include:

* To encode a syntactic entity, such as device commands or special data, which cannot be directly represented by the alphabet.
* To represent characters, referred to as &quot;character quoting&quot;, which cannot be typed in the current context, or would have an undesired interpretation. In this case, an escape sequence is a digraph consisting of an escape character itself and a &quot;quoted&quot; character.

===Control character===
Generally, an escape character is not a particular case of (device) control characters, nor vice versa. If we define control characters as non-graphic, or as having a special meaning for an output device (e.g. printer or text terminal) then any escape character for this device is a control one. But escape characters used in programming (such as the backslash, &quot;\&quot;) are graphic, hence are not control characters. Conversely most (but not all) of the ASCII &quot;control characters&quot; have some control function in isolation, therefore they are not escape characters.

In many programming languages, an escape character also forms some escape sequences which are referred to as control characters. For example, line break has an escape sequence of .

==Examples==

===JavaScript ===
JavaScript uses the (backslash) as an escape character for:
* single quote
* double quote
* backslash
* new line
* carriage return
* tab
* backspace
* form feed
* vertical tab (Internet Explorer 9 and older treats as instead of a vertical tab (). If cross-browser compatibility is a concern, use instead of .)
* null character () (only if the next character is not a decimal digit; else it is an octal escape sequence)
* character represented by the hexadecimal byte codice_1

The and escapes are not allowed in JSON strings.
Example code:
console.log(&quot;Using \\n \nWill shift the characters after \\n one row down&quot;)
console.log(&quot;Using \\t \twill shift the characters after \\t one tab length to the right&quot;)
console.log(&quot;Using \\r \rWill imitate a carriage return, which means shifting to the start of the row&quot;) // can be used to clear the screen on some terminals. Windows uses \r\n instead of \n alone
===ASCII escape character===
The ASCII &quot;escape&quot; character (octal: , hexadecimal: , or, in decimal, , also represented by the sequences or ) is used in many output devices to start a series of characters called a control sequence or escape sequence. Typically, the escape character was sent first in such a sequence to alert the device that the following characters were to be interpreted as a control sequence rather than as plain characters, then one or more characters would follow to specify some detailed action, after which the device would go back to interpreting characters normally. For example, the sequence of , followed by the printable characters , would cause a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VT102 terminal to move its cursor to the 10th cell of the 2nd line of the screen. This was later developed into ANSI escape codes covered by the ANSI X3.64 standard. The escape character also starts each command sequence in the Hewlett-Packard Printer Command Language.

An early reference to the term &quot;escape character&quot; is found in Bob Bemer&#x27;s IBM technical publications, who is credited with inventing this mechanism during his work on the ASCII character set.

The Escape key is usually found on standard PC keyboards. However, it is commonly absent from keyboards for PDAs and other devices not designed primarily for ASCII communications. The DEC VT220 series was one of the few popular keyboards that did not have a dedicated Esc key, instead of using one of the keys above the main keypad. In user interfaces of the 1970s–1980s it was not uncommon to use this key as an escape character, but in modern desktop computers, such use is dropped. Sometimes the key was identified with AltMode (for alternative mode). Even with no dedicated key, the escape character code could be generated by typing while simultaneously holding down .

===Programming and data formats===
Many modern programming languages specify the double-quote character () as a delimiter for a string literal. The backslash () escape character typically provides two ways to include double-quotes inside a string literal, either by modifying the meaning of the double-quote character embedded in the string ( becomes ), or by modifying the meaning of a sequence of characters including the hexadecimal value of a double-quote character ( becomes ).

C, C++, Java, and Ruby all allow exactly the same two backslash escape styles. The PostScript language and Microsoft Rich Text Format also use backslash escapes. The quoted-printable encoding uses the equals sign as an escape character.

URL and URI use %-escapes to quote characters with a special meaning, as for non-ASCII characters. The ampersand () character may be considered as an escape character in SGML and derived formats such as HTML and XML.

Some programming languages also provide other ways to represent special characters in literals, without requiring an escape character (see e.g. delimiter collision).

===Communication protocols===
The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) uses the octet (, or ASCII: codice_2) as an escape character. The octet immediately following should be XORed by before being passed to a higher level protocol. This is applied to both itself and the control character (which is used in PPP to mark the beginning and end of a frame) when those octets need to be transmitted by a higher level protocol encapsulated by PPP, as well as other octets negotiated when the link is established. That is, when a higher level protocol wishes to transmit , it is transmitted as the sequence , and is transmitted as .

===Bourne shell===
In Bourne shell (sh), the asterisk () and question mark () characters are wildcard characters expanded via globbing. Without a preceding escape character, an will expand to the names of all files in the working directory that do not start with a period if and only if there are such files, otherwise remains unexpanded. So to refer to a file literally called &quot;*&quot;, the shell must be told not to interpret it in this way, by preceding it with a backslash (). This modifies the interpretation of the asterisk (). Compare:
===Windows Command Prompt===
The Windows command-line interpreter uses a caret character () to escape reserved characters that have special meanings (in particular: , codice_3, , , , , ). The DOS command-line interpreter, though it has similar syntax, does not support this.

For example, on the Windows Command Prompt, this will result in a syntax error.

C:\&gt;echo &lt;hello world&gt;
The syntax of the command is incorrect.
whereas this will output the string: 

C:\&gt;echo ^&lt;hello world^&gt;
&lt;hello world&gt;
===Windows PowerShell===
In Windows, the backslash is used as a path separator; therefore, it generally cannot be used as an escape character. PowerShell uses backtick ( ` ) instead.

For example, the following command:

PS C:\&gt; echo &quot;`tFirst line`nNew line&quot;
 First line
New line

===Others===
* Quoted-printable, which encodes 8-bit data into 7-bit data of limited line lengths, uses the equals sign (codice_4) as an escape character.

== See also ==
* AltGr key used to type characters that are unusual for the locale of the keyboard layout.
* Escape sequences in C
* Leaning toothpick syndrome
* Nested quotation
* Stropping (syntax) – in some conventions a leading character (such as an apostrophe) functions as an escape character

<text>In telecommunications, extinction ratio (&quot;r&quot;e) is the ratio of two optical power levels of a digital signal generated by an optical source, e.g., a laser diode. The extinction ratio may be expressed as a fraction, in dB, or as a percentage. It may be given by
:formula_1
where &quot;P&quot;1 is the optical power level generated when the light source is on, and &quot;P&quot;0 is the power level generated when the light source is off.

The polarization extinction ratio (PER) is the ratio of optical powers of perpendicular polarizations, usually called TE (transverse electric) and TM (transverse magnetic). In telecommunications, the PER is used to characterize the degree of polarization in a polarization-maintaining device or fiber. For coherent transmitter and receiver, the PER is a key parameter, since X polarization and Y polarization are coded with different signals.

<text>In telecommunications, an eye pattern, also known as an eye diagram, is an oscilloscope display in which a digital signal from a receiver is repetitively sampled and applied to the vertical input (&quot;y-axis&quot;), while the data rate is used to trigger the horizontal sweep (&quot;x-axis&quot;). It is so called because, for several types of coding, the pattern looks like a series of eyes between a pair of rails. It is a tool for the evaluation of the combined effects of channel noise, dispersion and intersymbol interference on the performance of a baseband pulse-transmission system. The technique was first used with the WWII SIGSALY secure speech transmission system.

From a mathematical perspective, an eye pattern is a visualization of the probability density function (PDF) of the signal, modulo the unit interval (UI). In other words, it shows the probability of the signal being at each possible voltage across the duration of the UI. Typically a color ramp is applied to the PDF in order to make small brightness differences easier to visualize.

Several system performance measurements can be derived by analyzing the display. If the signals are too long, too short, poorly synchronized with the system clock, too high, too low, too noisy, or too slow to change, or have too much undershoot or overshoot, this can be observed from the eye diagram. An open eye pattern corresponds to minimal signal distortion. Distortion of the signal waveform due to intersymbol interference and noise appears as closure of the eye pattern.

== Calculation ==

=== Source data ===

The first step of computing an eye pattern is normally to obtain the waveform being analyzed in a quantized form. This may be done by measuring an actual electrical system with an oscilloscope of sufficient bandwidth, or by creating synthetic data with a circuit simulator in order to evaluate the signal integrity of a proposed design. A combination of the two approaches may be used as well: simulating the effects of an arbitrary circuit or transmission line on a measured signal, perhaps to determine whether a signal will still be intelligible after passing through a long cable. Interpolation may also be applied at this time in order to increase the number of samples per unit interval (UI) and produce a smooth, gap-free plot which is more visually appealing and easier to understand.

=== Slicing ===

Next, the position of each sample within the UI must be determined. There are several methods for doing this depending on the characteristics of the signal and the capabilities of the oscilloscope and software in use. This step is critically important for accurate visualization of jitter in the eye.

==== Triggering ====

A very simple method of slicing is to set the oscilloscope display to be slightly more than one UI wide, trigger on both rising and falling edges in the signal, and enable display persistence so that all measured waveforms &quot;stack&quot; into a single plot. This has the advantage of being possible on almost any oscilloscope (even fully analog ones) and can provide decent visualization of noise and overall signal shape, but completely destroys the jitter content of the signal since the instrument&#x27;s trigger re-synchronizes the plot to each UI. The only jitter visible with this method is that of the oscilloscope itself, as well as extremely high frequency jitter (frequencies with period less than the UI).

==== Fixed rate ====

A simple way to have the eye pattern display jitter in the signal is to estimate the symbol rate of the signal (perhaps by counting the average number of zero crossings in a known window of time) and acquiring many UIs in a single oscilloscope capture. The first zero crossing in the capture is located and declared to be the start of the first UI, and the remainder of the waveform is divided into chunks one UI long.

This approach can work adequately for stable signals in which the symbol rate remains exactly the same over time, however inaccuracies in the system mean that some drift is inevitable so it is rarely used in practice. In some protocols, such as SATA, the symbol rate is intentionally varied by use of spread spectrum clocking, so assuming a fixed rate will lead to the eye grossly exaggerating the actual jitter present on the signal. (While spread spectrum modulation on a clock is technically jitter in the strict sense, receivers for these systems are designed to track the modulation. The only jitter of interest to a signal integrity engineer is jitter much faster than the modulation rate, which the receiver cannot track effectively.)

==== Reference clock ====

With some protocols, such as HDMI, a reference clock is supplied along with the signal, either at the symbol rate or at a lower (but synchronized) frequency from which a symbol clock can be reconstructed. Since the actual receiver in the system uses the reference clock to sample the data, using this clock to determine UI boundaries allows the eye pattern to faithfully display the signal as the receiver sees it: only jitter between the signal and the reference clock is displayed.

==== Clock recovery ====

Most high speed serial signals, such as PCIe, DisplayPort, and most variants of Ethernet, use a line code which is intended to allow easy clock recovery by means of a PLL. Since this is how the actual receiver works, the most accurate way to slice data for the eye pattern is to implement a PLL with the same characteristics in software. Correct PLL configuration allows for the eye to conceal the effects of spread spectrum clocking and other long-term variation in the symbol rate which do not contribute to errors at the receiver, while still displaying higher frequency jitter.

=== Integration ===

The samples are then accumulated into a two-dimensional histogram, with the X axis representing time within the UI and the Y axis representing voltage. This is then normalized by dividing the value in each histogram bin by the value in the largest bin. Tone mapping, logarithmic scaling, or other mathematical transformations may be applied in order to emphasize different portions of the distribution, and a color gradient is applied to the final eye for display.

Large amounts of data may be needed to provide an accurate representation of the signal; tens to hundreds of millions of UIs are frequently used for a single eye pattern. In the example below, the eye using twelve thousand UIs only shows the basic shape of the eye, while the eye using eight million UIs shows far more nuance on the rising and falling edges.

== Modulation ==

Each form of baseband modulation produces an eye pattern with a unique appearance.

=== NRZ ===

The eye pattern of a signal should consist of two clearly distinct levels with smooth transitions between them.

=== MLT-3 ===

The eye pattern of a signal should consist of three clearly distinct levels (nominally -1, 0, +1 from bottom to top). The 0 level should be located at zero volts and the overall shape should be symmetric about the horizontal axis. The +1 and -1 states should have equal amplitude. There should be smooth transitions from the 0 state to the +1 and -1 states, however there should be no direct transitions from the -1 to +1 state (which would indicate the signal is PAM-3 rather than MLT-3).

=== PAM ===

The eye pattern of a signal should consist of N clearly distinct levels (depending on the PAM order, for example PAM-4 should have four levels and PAM-3 should have three). The overall shape should be symmetric about the horizontal axis and the spacing of all levels should be uniform.

=== PSK ===


== Channel effects ==

Many properties of a channel can be seen in the eye pattern.

=== Emphasis ===

Emphasis applied to a signal produces an additional level for each value of the signal which is higher (for pre-emphasis) or lower (for de-emphasis) than the nominal value.

The eye pattern for a signal with emphasis may be mistaken for that of a PAM signal at first glance, however closer inspection reveals some key differences. Most notably, an emphasized signal has a limited set of legal transitions:

* Strong state to corresponding weak state (1-1 or 0-0 bit pattern)
* Strong state to opposite strong state (second transition of a 1-0-1 or 0-1-0 bit pattern)
* Weak state to opposite strong state (second transition of a 1-1-0 or 0-0-1 bit pattern)

An emphasized signal will never transition from a weak state to the corresponding strong state, a weak state to another weak state, or remain in the same strong state for more than one UI. A PAM signal also normally has equally spaced levels while emphasized levels are normally closer to the nominal signal level.

=== High-Frequency Loss ===

Loss of printed circuit board traces and cables increases with frequency due to dielectric loss, which causes the channel to behave as a low-pass filter. The effect of this is an increase in signal rise/fall time. If the data rate is high enough or the channel is lossy enough, the signal may not even reach its full value during a fast 0-1-0 or 1-0-1 transition, and only stabilize after a run of several identical bits. This results in vertical closure of the eye.

The image below shows a 1.25 Gbit/s NRZ signal after passing through a lossy channel - an RG-188 coaxial cable approximately 12 feet (3.65 meters) in length. This channel has loss increasing in a fairly linear fashion from 0.1 dB at DC to 9 dB at 6 GHz.

The top and bottom &quot;rails&quot; of the eye show the final voltage the signal reaches after several consecutive bits with the same value. Since the channel has minimal loss at DC, the maximum signal amplitude is largely unaffected. Looking at the rising edge of the signal (a 0-1 pattern) we can see that the signal starts to level off around -300 ps, but continues to rise slowly over the duration of the UI. At around +300 ps, the signal either begins falling again (a 0-1-0 pattern) or continues rising slowly (an 0-1-1 pattern).

As high frequency losses increase the overall shape of the eye gradually degrades into a sinusoid (once higher frequency harmonics of the data has been eliminated, all that remains is the fundamental) and decreases in amplitude.

=== Impedance Mismatches ===

Stubs, impedance mismatches, and other defects in a transmission line can cause reflections visible as defects in the edges of the signal. Reflections with a delay greater than one UI often render the eye completely unreadable due to inter-symbol interference (ISI), however those with a shorter delay can be easily seen in the shape of the eye.

In the image below, a roughly one inch (25.4 mm) open circuited stub is present in the line, causing an initial low-impedance effect (reduced amplitude) followed by a positive reflection from the end of the stub with a delay of about 320 ps or 0.4 UIs. This can be clearly seen as a &quot;step&quot; in the rising edge in which the signal rises to a fraction of the full value, levels off for the round trip delay of the stub, then rises to its full value when the reflection arrives.

In the image below, an additional three inches of cable is added to the end of the same stub. The same &quot;step&quot; is present but is now four times as long, producing reflections at about 1280 ps or 1.6 UI. This produces extreme ISI (since the reflection of each UI arrives during the subsequent UI) which completely closes the eye.

==Measurements==

<text>In telecommunications, a facility is defined by Federal Standard 1037C as:
# A fixed, mobile, or transportable structure, including (a) all installed electrical and electronic wiring, cabling, and equipment and (b) all supporting structures, such as utility, ground network, and electrical supporting structures.
# A network-provided service to users or the network operating administration.
# A transmission pathway and associated equipment.
# In a protocol applicable to a data unit, such as a block or frame, an additional item of information or a constraint encoded within the protocol to provide the required control.
# A real property entity consisting of one or more of the following: a building, a structure, a utility system, pavement, and underlying land.
==Global Telecom Facility==
Telecommunications facility, is where a service can be offered. A location where a Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs) have their Hardware to process Telecom services. A phone call made to Jamaica can not be processed by a Telecom Facility in Canada or USA. If a phone number series belongs to say operator or carriers in Jamaica then only that operator knows if that phone number is valid and further if that phone number is on net to place a valid phone call. So all carriers in the world get the signal from the Telecom Facilities of the Digicel in Jamaica.

==In Canada==
Telecommunications facility, is same as Airport Facility. A location where a Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs) have their Hardware to process Telecom services.
Under Canadian federal and Québécois provincial law, a telecommunications facility, for the purposes of determining whether GST applies, is defined by §123(1) of the GST Act to be &quot;any facility, apparatus, or other thing (including any wire, cable, radio, optical, or other electromagnetic system, or any similar technical system or any part thereof) that is used or is capable of being used for telecommunications&quot;. This is a very broad definition that includes a wide range of things from satellites and earth stations, to telephones and fax machines.

<text>Fading distribution is the probability distribution of the value of signal fading, relative to a specified reference level.

In the case of phase interference fading, the time distribution of the instantaneous field strength usually approximates a Rayleigh distribution when several signal components of equal amplitude are present. 

The field strength is usually measured in volts per meter. 

The fading distribution may also be measured in terms of power level, where the unit of measure is usually watts per square meter and the expression is in decibels.

<text>In engineering, a fail-safe is a design feature or practice that, in the event of a failure of the design feature, inherently responds in a way that will cause minimal or no harm to other equipment, to the environment or to people. Unlike inherent safety to a particular hazard, a system being &quot;fail-safe&quot; does not mean that failure is naturally inconsequential, but rather that the system&#x27;s design prevents or mitigates unsafe consequences of the system&#x27;s failure. If and when a &quot;fail-safe&quot; system fails, it remains at least as safe as it was before the failure. Since many types of failure are possible, failure mode and effects analysis is used to examine failure situations and recommend safety design and procedures.

Some systems can never be made fail-safe, as continuous availability is needed. Redundancy, fault tolerance, or contingency plans are used for these situations (e.g. multiple independently controlled and fuel-fed engines).

==Examples==

===Mechanical or physical===

Examples include:
*Roller-shutter fire doors that are activated by building alarm systems or local smoke detectors must close automatically when signaled regardless of power. In case of power outage the coiling fire door does not need to close, but must be capable of automatic closing when given a signal from the building alarm systems or smoke detectors. A temperature-sensitive fusible link may be employed to hold the fire doors open against gravity or a closing spring. In case of fire, the link melts and releases the doors, and they close.
*Some airport baggage carts require that the person hold down a given cart&#x27;s handbrake switch at all times; if the handbrake switch is released, the brake will activate, and assuming that all other portions of the braking system are working properly, the cart will stop. The handbrake-holding requirement thus both operates according to the principles of &quot;fail-safety&quot; and contributes to (but does not necessarily ensure) the fail-security of the system. This is an example of a &quot;dead man&#x27;s switch&quot;.
*Lawnmowers and snow blowers have a hand-closed lever that must be held down at all times. If it is released, it stops the blade&#x27;s or rotor&#x27;s rotation. This also functions as a &quot;dead man&#x27;s switch&quot;.
*Air brakes on railway trains and air brakes on trucks. The brakes are held in the &quot;off&quot; position by air pressure created in the brake system. Should a brake line split, or a carriage become uncoupled, the air pressure will be lost and the brakes applied, by springs in the case of trucks, or by a local air reservoir in trains. It is impossible to drive a truck with a serious leak in the air brake system. (Trucks may also employ wig wags to indicate low air pressure.)
*Motorized gates – In case of power outage the gate can be pushed open by hand with no crank or key required. However, as this would allow virtually anyone to go through the gate, a &quot;fail-secure&quot; design is used: In a power outage, the gate can only be opened by a hand crank that is usually kept in a safe area or under lock and key. When such a gate provides vehicle access to homes, a fail-safe design is used, where the door opens to allow fire department access.
*Safety valves – Various devices that operate with fluids use fuses or safety valves as fail-safe mechanisms.
*A railway semaphore signal is specially designed so that, should the cable controlling the signal break, the arm returns to the &quot;danger&quot; position, preventing any trains passing the inoperative signal.
*Isolation valves, and control valves, that are used for example in systems containing hazardous substances, can be designed to close upon loss of power, for example by spring force. This is known as fail-closed upon loss of power.
*An elevator has brakes that are held off brake pads by the tension of the elevator cable. If the cable breaks, tension is lost and the brakes latch on the rails in the shaft, so that the elevator cabin does not fall.
* Vehicle air conditioning – Defrost controls require vacuum for diverter damper operation for all functions except defrost. If vacuum fails, defrost is still available.

===Electrical or electronic===
Examples include:
*Many devices are protected from short circuit by fuses, circuit breakers, or current limiting circuits. The electrical interruption under overload conditions will prevent damage or destruction of wiring or circuit devices due to overheating.
*Avionics using redundant systems to perform the same computation using three different systems. Different results indicate a fault in the system.
*Drive-by-wire and fly-by-wire controls such as an Accelerator Position Sensor typically have two potentiometers which read in opposite directions, such that moving the control will result in one reading becoming higher, and the other generally equally lower. Mismatches between the two readings indicates a fault in the system, and the ECU can often deduce which of the two readings is faulty.
*Traffic light controllers use a &quot;Conflict Monitor Unit&quot; to detect faults or conflicting signals and switch an intersection to an all flashing error signal, rather than displaying potentially dangerous conflicting signals, e.g. showing green in all directions.
*The automatic protection of programs and/or processing systems when a computer hardware or software failure is detected in a computer system. A classic example is a watchdog timer. See Fail-safe (computer).
*A control operation or function that prevents improper system functioning or catastrophic degradation in the event of circuit malfunction or operator error; for example, the failsafe track circuit used to control railway block signals. The fact that a flashing amber is more permissive than a solid amber on many railway lines is a sign of a failsafe, as the relay, if not working, will revert to a more restrictive setting.
*The iron pellet ballast on the Bathyscaphe is dropped to allow the submarine to ascend. The ballast is held in place by electromagnets. If electrical power fails, the ballast is released, and the submarine then ascends to safety.
*Many nuclear reactor designs have neutron-absorbing control rods suspended by electromagnets. If the power fails, they drop under gravity into the core and shut down the chain reaction in seconds by absorbing the neutrons needed for fission to continue.
*In industrial automation, alarm circuits are usually &quot;normally closed&quot;. This ensures that in case of a wire break the alarm will be triggered. If the circuit were normally open, a wire failure would go undetected, while blocking actual alarm signals.
*Analog sensors and modulating actuators can usually be installed and wired such that the circuit failure results in an out-of-bound reading – see current loop. For example, a potentiometer indicating pedal position might only travel from 20% to 80% of its full range, such that a cable break or short results in a 0% or 100% reading.
*In control systems, critically important signals can be carried by a complementary pair of wires (&lt;signal&gt; and &lt;not_signal&gt;). Only states where the two signals are opposite (one is high, the other low) are valid. If both are high or both are low the control system knows that something is wrong with the sensor or connecting wiring. Simple failure modes (dead sensor, cut or unplugged wires) are thereby detected. An example would be a control system reading both the normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC) poles of a SPDT selector switch against common, and checking them for coherency before reacting to the input.
*In HVAC control systems, actuators that control dampers and valves may be fail-safe, for example, to prevent coils from freezing or rooms from overheating. Older pneumatic actuators were inherently fail-safe because if the air pressure against the internal diaphragm failed, the built-in spring would push the actuator to its home position – of course the home position needed to be the &quot;safe&quot; position. Newer electrical and electronic actuators need additional components (springs or capacitors) to automatically drive the actuator to home position upon loss of electrical power.
*Programmable logic controllers (PLCs). To make a PLC fail-safe the system does not require energization to stop the drives associated. For example, usually, an emergency stop is a normally closed contact. In the event of a power failure this would remove the power directly from the coil and also the PLC input. Hence, a fail-safe system.
*If a voltage regulator fails, it can destroy connected equipment. A crowbar (circuit) prevents damage by short-circuiting the power supply as soon as it detects overvoltage.

===Procedural safety===

As well as physical devices and systems fail-safe procedures can be created so that if a procedure is not carried out or carried out incorrectly no dangerous action results. 
For example:
*Spacecraft trajectory - During early Apollo program missions to the Moon, the spacecraft was put on a free return trajectory — if the engines had failed at lunar orbit insertion, the craft would have safely coasted back to Earth.
*The pilot of an aircraft landing on an aircraft carrier increases the throttle to full power at touchdown. If the arresting wires fail to capture the aircraft, it is able to take off again; this is an example of &quot;fail-safe practice&quot;.
*In railway signalling signals which are not in active use for a train are required to be kept in the &#x27;danger&#x27; position. The default position of every controlled absolute signal is therefore &quot;danger&quot;, and therefore a positive action — setting signals to &quot;clear&quot; — is required before a train may pass. This practice also ensures that, in case of a fault in the signalling system, an incapacitated signalman, or the unexpected entry of a train, that a train will never be shown an erroneous &quot;clear&quot; signal.
*Railroad engineers are instructed that a railway signal showing a confusing, contradictory or unfamiliar aspect (for example a colour light signal that has suffered an electrical failure and is showing no light at all) must be treated as showing &quot;danger&quot;. In this way, the driver contributes to the fail-safety of the system.

==Other terminology==
Fail-safe (foolproof) devices are also known as &quot;poka-yoke&quot; devices. &quot;Poka-yoke&quot;, a Japanese term, was coined by Shigeo Shingo, a quality expert. &quot;Safe to fail&quot; refers to civil engineering designs such as the Room for the River project in Netherlands and the Thames Estuary 2100 Plan which incorporate flexible adaptation strategies or climate change adaptation which provide for, and limit, damage, should severe events such as 500-year floods occur.

===Fail safe and fail secure===
&quot;Fail-safe&quot; and &quot;fail-secure&quot; are distinct concepts. &quot;Fail-safe&quot; means that a device will not endanger lives or property when it fails. &quot;Fail-secure,&quot; also called &quot;fail-closed,&quot; means that access or data will not fall into the wrong hands in a security failure. Sometimes the approaches suggest opposite solutions. For example, if a building catches fire, fail-safe systems would unlock doors to ensure quick escape and allow firefighters inside, while fail-secure would lock doors to prevent unauthorized access to the building.

The opposite of &quot;fail-closed&quot; is called &quot;fail-open&quot;.

===Fail active operational===
Fail active operational can be installed on systems that have a high degree of redundancy so that a single failure of any part of the system can be tolerated (fail active operational) and a second failure can be detected – at which point the system will turn itself off (uncouple, fail passive). One way of accomplishing this is to have three identical systems installed, and a control logic which detects discrepancies. An example for this are many aircraft systems, among them inertial navigation systems and pitot tubes.

===Failsafe point===
During the Cold War, &quot;failsafe point&quot; was the term used for the point of no return for American Strategic Air Command nuclear bombers, just outside Soviet airspace. In the event of receiving an attack order, the bombers were required to linger at the failsafe point and wait for a second confirming order; until one was received, they would not arm their bombs or proceed further. The design was to prevent any single failure of the American command system causing nuclear war. This sense of the term entered the American popular lexicon with the publishing of the 1962 novel &quot;Fail-Safe&quot;.
(Other nuclear war command control systems have used the opposite scheme, fail-deadly, which requires continuous or regular proof that an enemy first-strike attack has &quot;not&quot; occurred to &quot;prevent&quot; the launching of a nuclear strike.)

<text>In electronics, fall time (pulse decay time) formula_1 is the time taken for the amplitude of a pulse to decrease (fall) from a specified value (usually 90% of the peak value exclusive of overshoot or undershoot) to another specified value (usually 10% of the maximum value exclusive of overshoot or undershoot). 

Limits on undershoot and oscillation (also known as ringing and hunting) are sometimes additionally stated when specifying fall time limits.

<text>In network management, fault management is the set of functions that detect, isolate, and correct malfunctions in a telecommunications network, compensate for environmental changes, and include maintaining and examining error logs, accepting and acting on error detection notifications, tracing and identifying faults, carrying out sequences of diagnostics tests, correcting faults, reporting error conditions, and localizing and tracing faults by examining and manipulating database information.

When a fault or event occurs, a network component will often send a notification to the network operator using a protocol such as SNMP. An alarm is a persistent indication of a fault that clears only when the triggering condition has been resolved. A current list of problems occurring on the network component is often kept in the form of an active alarm list such as is defined in RFC 3877, the Alarm MIB. A list of cleared faults is also maintained by most network management systems.

Fault management systems may use complex filtering systems to assign alarms to severity levels. These can range in severity from debug to emergency, as in the syslog protocol. Alternatively, they could use the ITU X.733 Alarm Reporting Function&#x27;s perceived severity field. This takes on values of cleared, indeterminate, critical, major, minor or warning. Note that the latest version of the syslog protocol draft under development within the IETF includes a mapping between these two different sets of severities. It is considered good practice to send a notification not only when a problem has occurred, but also when it has been resolved. The latter notification would have a severity of clear.

A fault management console allows a network administrator or system operator to monitor events from multiple systems and perform actions based on this information. Ideally, a fault management system should be able to correctly identify events and automatically take action, either launching a program or script to take corrective action, or activating notification software that allows a human to take proper intervention (i.e. send e-mail or SMS text to a mobile phone). Some notification systems also have escalation rules that will notify a chain of individuals based on availability and severity of alarm.

==Types==
There are two primary ways to perform fault management - these are active and passive. Passive fault management is done by collecting alarms from devices (normally via SNMP traps) when something happens in the devices. In this mode, the fault management system only knows if a device it is monitoring is intelligent enough to generate an error and report it to the management tool. However, if the device being monitored fails completely or locks up, it won&#x27;t throw an alarm and the problem will not be detected. Active fault management addresses this issue by actively monitoring devices via tools such as ping to determine if the device is active and responding. If the device stops responding, active monitoring will throw an alarm showing the device as unavailable and allows for the proactive correction of the problem.

Fault management includes any tools or procedure for testing, diagnosing or repairing the network when a failure occurs.

<text>An optical amplifier is a device that amplifies an optical signal directly, without the need to first convert it to an electrical signal. An optical amplifier may be thought of as a laser without an optical cavity, or one in which feedback from the cavity is suppressed. Optical amplifiers are important in optical communication and laser physics. They are used as optical repeaters in the long distance fiber-optic cables which carry much of the world&#x27;s telecommunication links.

There are several different physical mechanisms that can be used to amplify a light signal, which correspond to the major types of optical amplifiers. In doped fiber amplifiers and bulk lasers, stimulated emission in the amplifier&#x27;s gain medium causes amplification of incoming light. In semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), electron–hole recombination occurs. In Raman amplifiers, Raman scattering of incoming light with phonons in the lattice of the gain medium produces photons coherent with the incoming photons. Parametric amplifiers use parametric amplification.

== History ==
The principle of optical amplification was invented by Gordon Gould on November 13, 1957. He filed US Patent US80453959A on April 6, 1959, titled &quot;Light Amplifiers Employing Collisions to Produce Population Inversions&quot; (subsequently amended as a continuation in part and finally issued as on May 4, 1988). The patent covered “the amplification of light by the stimulated emission of photons from ions, atoms or molecules in gaseous, liquid or solid state.” In total, Gould obtained 48 patents related to the optical amplifier that covered 80% of the lasers on the market at the time of issuance.

Gould co-founded an optical telecommunications equipment firm, Optelecom Inc., that helped start Ciena Corp with his former head of Light Optics Research, David Huber and Kevin Kimberlin. Huber and Steve Alexander of Ciena invented the dual-stage optical amplifier () that was a key to the first dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM) system, that they released in June 1996. This marked the start of optical networking. Its significance was recognized at the time by optical authority, Shoichi Sudo and technology analyst, George Gilder in 1997, when Sudo wrote that optical amplifiers “will usher in a worldwide revolution called the Information Age” and Gilder compared the optical amplifier to the integrated circuit in importance, predicting that it would make possible the Age of Information. Optical amplification WDM systems are the common basis of all local, metro, national, intercontinental and subsea telecommunications networks and the technology of choice for the fiber optic backbones of the Internet (e.g. fiber-optic cables form a basis of modern-day computer networking).

==Laser amplifiers==
Almost any laser active gain medium can be pumped to produce gain for light at the wavelength of a laser made with the same material as its gain medium. Such amplifiers are commonly used to produce high power laser systems. Special types such as regenerative amplifiers and chirped-pulse amplifiers are used to amplify ultrashort pulses.

=== Solid-state amplifiers ===
Solid-state amplifiers are optical amplifiers that use a wide range of doped solid-state materials ( Yb:YAG, Ti:Sa) and different geometries (disk, slab, rod) to amplify optical signals. The variety of materials allows the amplification of different wavelengths, while the shape of the medium can distinguish between those more suitable for energy or average power scaling. Beside their use in fundamental research from gravitational wave detection to high energy physics at the National Ignition Facility they can also be found in many of today&#x27;s ultra short pulsed lasers.

=== Doped-fiber amplifiers ===

Doped-fiber amplifiers (DFAs) are optical amplifiers that use a doped optical fiber as a gain medium to amplify an optical signal. They are related to fiber lasers. The signal to be amplified and a pump laser are multiplexed into the doped fiber, and the signal is amplified through interaction with the doping ions.

Amplification is achieved by stimulated emission of photons from dopant ions in the doped fiber. The pump laser excites ions into a higher energy from where they can decay via stimulated emission of a photon at the signal wavelength back to a lower energy level. The excited ions can also decay spontaneously (spontaneous emission) or even through nonradiative processes involving interactions with phonons of the glass matrix. These last two decay mechanisms compete with stimulated emission reducing the efficiency of light amplification.

The &quot;amplification window&quot; of an optical amplifier is the range of optical wavelengths for which the amplifier yields a usable gain. The amplification window is determined by the spectroscopic properties of the dopant ions, the glass structure of the optical fiber, and the wavelength and power of the pump laser.

Although the electronic transitions of an isolated ion are very well defined, broadening of the energy levels occurs when the ions are incorporated into the glass of the optical fiber and thus the amplification window is also broadened. This broadening is both homogeneous (all ions exhibit the same broadened spectrum) and inhomogeneous (different ions in different glass locations exhibit different spectra). Homogeneous broadening arises from the interactions with phonons of the glass, while inhomogeneous broadening is caused by differences in the glass sites where different ions are hosted. Different sites expose ions to different local electric fields, which shifts the energy levels via the Stark effect. In addition, the Stark effect also removes the degeneracy of energy states having the same total angular momentum (specified by the quantum number J). Thus, for example, the trivalent erbium ion (Er3+) has a ground state with J = 15/2, and in the presence of an electric field splits into J + 1/2 = 8 sublevels with slightly different energies. The first excited state has J = 13/2 and therefore a Stark manifold with 7 sublevels. Transitions from the J = 13/2 excited state to the J= 15/2 ground state are responsible for the gain at 1500 nm wavelength. The gain spectrum of the EDFA has several peaks that are smeared by the above broadening mechanisms. The net result is a very broad spectrum (30 nm in silica, typically). The broad gain-bandwidth of fiber amplifiers make them particularly useful in wavelength-division multiplexed communications systems as a single amplifier can be utilized to amplify all signals being carried on a fiber and whose wavelengths fall within the gain window.

An &quot;erbium-doped waveguide amplifier&quot; (EDWA) is an optical amplifier that uses a waveguide to boost an optical signal.

====Basic principle of EDFA====
A relatively high-powered beam of light is mixed with the input signal using a wavelength selective coupler (WSC). The input signal and the excitation light must be at significantly different wavelengths. The mixed light is guided into a section of fiber with erbium ions included in the core. This high-powered light beam excites the erbium ions to their higher-energy state. When the photons belonging to the signal at a different wavelength from the pump light meet the excited erbium ions, the erbium ions give up some of their energy to the signal and return to their lower-energy state.

A significant point is that the erbium gives up its energy in the form of additional photons which are exactly in the same phase and direction as the signal being amplified. So the signal is amplified along its direction of travel only. This is not unusual – when an atom &quot;lases&quot; it always gives up its energy in the same direction and phase as the incoming light. Thus all of the additional signal power is guided in the same fiber mode as the incoming signal. An optical isolator is usually placed at the output to prevent reflections returning from the attached fiber. Such reflections disrupt amplifier operation and in the extreme case can cause the amplifier to become a laser.

The erbium doped amplifier is a high gain amplifier.

====Noise====
The principal source of noise in DFAs is amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), which has a spectrum approximately the same as the gain spectrum of the amplifier. Noise figure in an ideal DFA is 3 dB, while practical amplifiers can have noise figure as large as 6–8 dB.

As well as decaying via stimulated emission, electrons in the upper energy level can also decay by spontaneous emission, which occurs at random, depending upon the glass structure and inversion level. Photons are emitted spontaneously in all directions, but a proportion of those will be emitted in a direction that falls within the numerical aperture of the fiber and are thus captured and guided by the fiber. Those photons captured may then interact with other dopant ions, and are thus amplified by stimulated emission. The initial spontaneous emission is therefore amplified in the same manner as the signals, hence the term a&quot;mplified spontaneous emission&quot;. ASE is emitted by the amplifier in both the forward and reverse directions, but only the forward ASE is a direct concern to system performance since that noise will co-propagate with the signal to the receiver where it degrades system performance. Counter-propagating ASE can, however, lead to degradation of the amplifier&#x27;s performance since the ASE can deplete the inversion level and thereby reduce the gain of the amplifier and increase the noise produced relative to the desired signal gain.
Noise figure can be analyzed in both the optical domain and in the electrical domain. In the optical domain, measurement of the ASE, the optical signal gain, and signal wavelength using an optical spectrum analyzer permits calculation of the noise figure. For the electrical measurement method, the detected photocurrent noise is evaluated with a low-noise electrical spectrum analyzer, which along with measurement of the amplifier gain permits a noise figure measurement. Generally, the optical technique provides a more simple method, though it is not inclusive of excess noise effects captured by the electrical method such multi-path interference (MPI) noise generation. In both methods, attention to effects such as the spontaneous emission accompanying the input signal are critical to accurate measurement of noise figure.

====Gain saturation====
Gain is achieved in a DFA due to population inversion of the dopant ions. The inversion level of a DFA is set, primarily, by the power of the pump wavelength and the power at the amplified wavelengths. As the signal power increases, or the pump power decreases, the inversion level will reduce and thereby the gain of the amplifier will be reduced. This effect is known as gain saturation – as the signal level increases, the amplifier saturates and cannot produce any more output power, and therefore the gain reduces. Saturation is also commonly known as gain compression.

To achieve optimum noise performance DFAs are operated under a significant amount of gain compression (10 dB typically), since that reduces the rate of spontaneous emission, thereby reducing ASE. Another advantage of operating the DFA in the gain saturation region is that small fluctuations in the input signal power are reduced in the output amplified signal: smaller input signal powers experience larger (less saturated) gain, while larger input powers see less gain.

The leading edge of the pulse is amplified, until the saturation energy of the gain medium is reached. In some condition, the width (FWHM) of the pulse is reduced.

====Inhomogeneous broadening effects====
Due to the inhomogeneous portion of the linewidth broadening of the dopant ions, the gain spectrum has an inhomogeneous component and gain saturation occurs, to a small extent, in an inhomogeneous manner. This effect is known as &quot;spectral hole burning&quot; because a high power signal at one wavelength can &#x27;burn&#x27; a hole in the gain for wavelengths close to that signal by saturation of the inhomogeneously broadened ions. Spectral holes vary in width depending on the characteristics of the optical fiber in question and the power of the burning signal, but are typically less than 1 nm at the short wavelength end of the C-band, and a few nm at the long wavelength end of the C-band. The depth of the holes are very small, though, making it difficult to observe in practice.

====Polarization effects====
Although the DFA is essentially a polarization independent amplifier, a small proportion of the dopant ions interact preferentially with certain polarizations and a small dependence on the polarization of the input signal may occur (typically &lt; 0.5 dB). This is called polarization dependent gain (PDG).

The absorption and emission cross sections of the ions can be modeled as ellipsoids with the major axes aligned at random in all directions in different glass sites. The random distribution of the orientation of the ellipsoids in a glass produces a macroscopically isotropic medium, but a strong pump laser induces an anisotropic distribution by selectively exciting those ions that are more aligned with the optical field vector of the pump. Also, those excited ions aligned with the signal field produce more stimulated emission. The change in gain is thus dependent on the alignment of the polarizations of the pump and signal lasers – i.e. whether the two lasers are interacting with the same sub-set of dopant ions or not. 
In an ideal doped fiber without birefringence, the PDG would be inconveniently large. Fortunately, in optical fibers small amounts of birefringence are always present and, furthermore, the fast and slow axes vary randomly along the fiber length. A typical DFA has several tens of meters, long enough to already show this randomness of the birefringence axes. These two combined effects (which in transmission fibers give rise to polarization mode dispersion) produce a misalignment of the relative polarizations of the signal and pump lasers along the fiber, thus tending to average out the PDG. The result is that PDG is very difficult to observe in a single amplifier (but is noticeable in links with several cascaded amplifiers).

=== Erbium-doped optical fiber amplifiers ===

The erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) is the most deployed fiber amplifier as its amplification window coincides with the third transmission window of silica-based optical fiber. The core of a silica fiber is doped with trivalent erbium ions (Er3+) and can be efficiently pumped with a laser at or near wavelengths of 980 nm and 1480 nm, and gain is exhibited in the 1550 nm region. The EDFA amplification region varies from application to application and can be anywhere from a few nm up to ~80 nm. Typical use of EDFA in telecommunications calls for &quot;Conventional&quot;, or C-band amplifiers (from ~1525 nm to ~1565 nm) or &quot;Long&quot;, or L-band amplifiers (from ~1565 nm to ~1610 nm). Both of these bands can be amplified by EDFAs, but it is normal to use two different amplifiers, each optimized for one of the bands.

The principal difference between C- and L-band amplifiers is that a longer length of doped fiber is used in L-band amplifiers. The longer length of fiber allows a lower inversion level to be used, thereby giving emission at longer wavelengths (due to the band-structure of Erbium in silica) while still providing a useful amount of gain.

EDFAs have two commonly used pumping bands – 980 nm and 1480 nm. The 980 nm band has a higher absorption cross-section and is generally used where low-noise performance is required. The absorption band is relatively narrow and so wavelength stabilised laser sources are typically needed. The 1480 nm band has a lower, but broader, absorption cross-section and is generally used for higher power amplifiers. A combination of 980 nm and 1480 nm pumping is generally utilised in amplifiers.

Gain and lasing in erbium-doped fibers were first demonstrated in 1986–87 by two groups; one including David N. Payne, R. Mears, I.M Jauncey and L. Reekie, from the University of Southampton and one from AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, consisting of E. Desurvire, P. Becker, and J. Simpson. The dual-stage optical amplifier which enabled dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM) was invented by Stephen B. Alexander at Ciena Corporation.

===Doped fiber amplifiers for other wavelength ranges===
Thulium doped fiber amplifiers have been used in the S-band (1450–1490 nm) and Praseodymium doped amplifiers in the 1300 nm region. However, those regions have not seen any significant commercial use so far and so those amplifiers have not been the subject of as much development as the EDFA. However, Ytterbium doped fiber lasers and amplifiers, operating near 1 micrometre wavelength, have many applications in industrial processing of materials, as these devices can be made with extremely high output power (tens of kilowatts).

==Semiconductor optical amplifier==
Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are amplifiers which use a semiconductor to provide the gain medium. These amplifiers have a similar structure to Fabry–Pérot laser diodes but with anti-reflection design elements at the end faces. Recent designs include anti-reflective coatings and tilted wave guide and window regions which can reduce end face reflection to less than 0.001%. Since this creates a loss of power from the cavity which is greater than the gain, it prevents the amplifier from acting as a laser. Another type of SOA consists of two regions. One part has a structure of a Fabry-Pérot laser diode and the other has a tapered geometry in order to reduce the power density on the output facet.

Semiconductor optical amplifiers are typically made from group III-V compound semiconductors such as GaAs/AlGaAs, InP/InGaAs, InP/InGaAsP and InP/InAlGaAs, though any direct band gap semiconductors such as II-VI could conceivably be used. Such amplifiers are often used in telecommunication systems in the form of fiber-pigtailed components, operating at signal wavelengths between 850 nm and 1600 nm and generating gains of up to 30 dB.

The semiconductor optical amplifier is of small size and electrically pumped. It can be potentially less expensive than the EDFA and can be integrated with semiconductor lasers, modulators, etc. However, the performance is still not comparable with the EDFA. The SOA has higher noise, lower gain, moderate polarization dependence and high nonlinearity with fast transient time. The main advantage of SOA is that all four types of nonlinear operations (cross gain modulation, cross phase modulation, wavelength conversion and four wave mixing) can be conducted. Furthermore, SOA can be run with a low power laser.
This originates from the short nanosecond or less upper state lifetime, so that the gain reacts rapidly to changes of pump or signal power and the changes of gain also cause phase changes which can distort the signals.
This nonlinearity presents the most severe problem for optical communication applications. However it provides the possibility for gain in different wavelength regions from the EDFA. &quot;Linear optical amplifiers&quot; using gain-clamping techniques have been developed.

High optical nonlinearity makes semiconductor amplifiers attractive for all optical signal processing like all-optical switching and wavelength conversion. There has been much research on semiconductor optical amplifiers as elements for optical signal processing, wavelength conversion, clock recovery, signal demultiplexing, and pattern recognition.

===Vertical-cavity SOA===
A recent addition to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). The major difference when comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching lasing threshold. Due to the extremely short cavity length, and correspondingly thin gain medium, these devices exhibit very low single-pass gain (typically on the order of a few percent) and also a very large free spectral range (FSR). The small single-pass gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In addition to boosting the total signal gain, the use of the resonant cavity structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the optical cavity, this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.

Given their vertical-cavity geometry, VCSOAs are resonant cavity optical amplifiers that operate with the input/output signal entering/exiting normal to the wafer surface. In addition to their small size, the surface normal operation of VCSOAs leads to a number of advantages, including low power consumption, low noise figure, polarization insensitive gain, and the ability to fabricate high fill factor two-dimensional arrays on a single semiconductor chip. These devices are still in the early stages of research, though promising preamplifier results have been demonstrated. Further extensions to VCSOA technology are the demonstration of wavelength tunable devices. These MEMS-tunable vertical-cavity SOAs utilize a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based tuning mechanism for wide and continuous tuning of the peak gain wavelength of the amplifier. SOAs have a more rapid gain response, which is in the order of 1 to 100 ps.

===Tapered amplifiers===
For high output power and broader wavelength range, tapered amplifiers are used. These amplifiers consist of a lateral single-mode section and a section with a tapered structure, where the laser light is amplified. The tapered structure leads to a reduction of the power density at the output facet.

Typical parameters:
* wavelength range: 633 to 1480 nm
* input power: 10 to 50 mW
* output power: up to 3 W

== Raman amplifier ==

In a Raman amplifier, the signal is intensified by Raman amplification. Unlike the EDFA and SOA the amplification effect is achieved by a nonlinear interaction between the signal and a pump laser within an optical fiber. There are two types of Raman amplifier: distributed and lumped. A distributed Raman amplifier is one in which the transmission fiber is utilised as the gain medium by multiplexing a pump wavelength with signal wavelength, while a lumped Raman amplifier utilises a dedicated, shorter length of fiber to provide amplification. In the case of a lumped Raman amplifier, a highly nonlinear fiber with a small core is utilised to increase the interaction between signal and pump wavelengths, and thereby reduce the length of fiber required.

The pump light may be coupled into the transmission fiber in the same direction as the signal (co-directional pumping), in the opposite direction (contra-directional pumping) or both. Contra-directional pumping is more common as the transfer of noise from the pump to the signal is reduced.

The pump power required for Raman amplification is higher than that required by the EDFA, with in excess of 500 mW being required to achieve useful levels of gain in a distributed amplifier. Lumped amplifiers, where the pump light can be safely contained to avoid safety implications of high optical powers, may use over 1 W of optical power.

The principal advantage of Raman amplification is its ability to provide distributed amplification within the transmission fiber, thereby increasing the length of spans between amplifier and regeneration sites. The amplification bandwidth of Raman amplifiers is defined by the pump wavelengths utilised and so amplification can be provided over wider, and different, regions than may be possible with other amplifier types which rely on dopants and device design to define the amplification &#x27;window&#x27;.

Raman amplifiers have some fundamental advantages. First, Raman gain exists in every fiber, which provides a cost-effective means of upgrading from the terminal ends. Second, the gain is nonresonant, which means that gain is available over the entire transparency region of the fiber ranging from approximately 0.3 to 2 μm. A third advantage of Raman amplifiers is that the gain spectrum can be tailored by adjusting the pump wavelengths. For instance, multiple pump lines can be used to increase the optical bandwidth, and the pump distribution determines the gain flatness. Another advantage of Raman amplification is that it is a relatively broad-band amplifier with a bandwidth &gt; 5 THz, and the gain is reasonably flat over a wide wavelength range.

However, a number of challenges for Raman amplifiers prevented their earlier adoption. First, compared to the EDFAs, Raman amplifiers have relatively poor pumping efficiency at lower signal powers. Although a disadvantage, this lack of pump efficiency also makes gain clamping easier in Raman amplifiers. Second, Raman amplifiers require a longer gain fiber. However, this disadvantage can be mitigated by combining gain and the dispersion compensation in a single fiber. A third disadvantage of Raman amplifiers is a fast response time, which gives rise to new sources of noise, as further discussed below. Finally, there are concerns of nonlinear penalty in the amplifier for the WDM signal channels.

== Optical parametric amplifier ==
An optical parametric amplifier allows the amplification of a weak signal-impulse in a nonlinear medium such as a noncentrosymmetric nonlinear medium (e.g. Beta barium borate (BBO)) or even a standard fused silica optical fiber via the Kerr effect. In contrast to the previously mentioned amplifiers, which are mostly used in telecommunication environments, this type finds its main application in expanding the frequency tunability of ultrafast solid-state lasers (e.g. Ti:sapphire). By using a noncollinear interaction geometry optical parametric amplifiers are capable of extremely broad amplification bandwidths.

==21st century==
In the 21st century high power fiber lasers were adopted as an industrial material processing tool, and were expanding into other markets including the medical and scientific markets. One key enhancement enabling penetration into the scientific market was improvement in high finesse fiber amplifiers, which became able to deliver single frequency linewidths (&lt;5 kHz) together with excellent beam quality and stable linearly polarized output. Systems meeting these specifications steadily progressed from a few watts of output power initially, to tens of watts and later hundreds of watts. This power increase was achieved with developments in fiber technology, such as the adoption of stimulated brillouin scattering (SBS) suppression/mitigation techniques within the fiber, and improvements in overall amplifier design, including large mode area (LMA) fibers with a low-aperture core, micro-structured rod-type fiber helical core, or chirally-coupled core fibers, and tapered double-clad fibers (T-DCF). high finesse, high power and pulsed fiber amplifiers delivered power levels exceeding those available from commercial solid-state single-frequency sources, and stable optimized performance, opening up new scientific applications.

==Implementations==
There are several simulation tools that can be used to design optical amplifiers. Popular commercial tools have been developed by Optiwave Systems and VPI Systems.

<text>Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a standard for data transmission in a local area network.
It uses optical fiber as its standard underlying physical medium.

It was also later specified to use copper cable, in which case it may be called CDDI (Copper Distributed Data Interface), standardized as TP-PMD (Twisted-Pair Physical Medium-Dependent), also referred to as TP-DDI (Twisted-Pair Distributed Data Interface).

FDDI was effectively made obsolete in local networks by Fast Ethernet which offered the same 100 Mbit/s speeds, but at a much lower cost and, from 1998 on, by Gigabit Ethernet due to its speed, even lower cost, and ubiquity.

==Description==
FDDI provides a 100 Mbit/s optical standard for data transmission in local area network that can extend in length up to . Although FDDI logical topology is a ring-based token network, it did not use the IEEE 802.5 Token Ring protocol as its basis; instead, its protocol was derived from the IEEE 802.4 token bus &quot;timed token&quot; protocol. In addition to covering large geographical areas, FDDI local area networks can support thousands of users. FDDI offers both a Dual-Attached Station (DAS), counter-rotating token ring topology and a Single-Attached Station (SAS), token bus passing ring topology.

FDDI, as a product of American National Standards Institute X3T9.5 (now X3T12), conforms to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of functional layering using other protocols. The standards process started in the mid 1980s.
FDDI-II, a version of FDDI described in 1989, added circuit-switched service capability to the network so that it could also handle voice and video signals. Work started to connect FDDI networks to synchronous optical networking (SONET) technology.

An FDDI network contains two rings, one as a secondary backup in case the primary ring fails. The primary ring offers up to 100 Mbit/s capacity. When a network has no requirement for the secondary ring to do backup, it can also carry data, extending capacity to 200 Mbit/s. The single ring can extend the maximum distance; a dual ring can extend . FDDI had a larger maximum frame size (4,352 bytes) than the standard Ethernet family, which only supports a maximum frame size of 1,500 bytes, allowing better effective data rates in some cases.

==Topology==
Designers normally constructed FDDI rings in a network topology such as a &quot;dual ring of trees&quot;. A small number of devices, typically infrastructure devices such as routers and concentrators rather than host computers, were &quot;dual-attached&quot; to both rings. Host computers then connect as single-attached devices to the routers or concentrators. The dual ring in its most degenerate form simply collapses into a single device. Typically, a computer-room contained the whole dual ring, although some implementations deployed FDDI as a metropolitan area network.

FDDI requires this network topology because the dual ring actually passes through each connected device and requires each such device to remain continuously operational.
The standard actually allows for optical bypasses, but network engineers consider these unreliable and error-prone. Devices such as workstations and minicomputers that might not come under the control of the network managers are not suitable for connection to the dual ring.

As an alternative to using a dual-attached connection, a workstation can obtain the same degree of resilience through a dual-homed connection made simultaneously to two separate devices in the same FDDI ring. One of the connections becomes active while the other one is automatically blocked. If the first connection fails, the backup link takes over with no perceptible delay.
== Frame format ==
The frame check sequence uses the same cyclic redundancy check as Token Ring and Ethernet.

The Internet Engineering Task Force defined a standard for transmission of the Internet Protocol (which would be the protocol data unit in this case) over FDDI. It was first proposed in June 1989 and revised in 1990. Some aspects of the protocol were compatible with the IEEE 802.2 standard for logical link control. For example, the 48-bit MAC addresses that became popular with the Ethernet family. Thus other protocols such as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) could be common as well.

==Deployment==
FDDI was considered an attractive campus backbone network technology in the early to mid 1990s since existing Ethernet networks only offered 10 Mbit/s data rates and Token Ring networks only offered 4 Mbit/s or 16 Mbit/s rates. Thus it was a relatively high-speed choice of that era, with speeds such as 100 Mbit/s.
By 1994, vendors included Cisco Systems, National Semiconductor, Network Peripherals, SysKonnect (acquired by Marvell Technology Group), and 3Com.

FDDI installations have largely been replaced by Ethernet deployments.

==Standards==
FDDI standards included:
* ANSI X3.139-1987, Media Access Control (MAC) — also ISO 9314-2
* ANSI X3.148-1988, Physical Layer Protocol (PHY) — also ISO 9314-1
* ANSI X3.166-1989, Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) — also ISO 9314-3
* ANSI X3.184-1993, Single Mode Fiber Physical Medium Dependent (SMF-PMD) — also ISO 9314-4
* ANSI X3.229-1994, Station Management (SMT) — also ISO 9314-6
* ANSI X3.263-1995, Twisted Pair Physical Medium Dependent (TP-PMD)

<text>In physics, field strength is the &quot;magnitude&quot; of a vector-valued field (e.g., in volts per meter, V/m, for an electric field E). 
For example, an electromagnetic field has both electric field strength and magnetic field strength.
As an application, in radio frequency telecommunications, the signal strength excites a receiving antenna and thereby induces a voltage at a specific frequency and polarization in order to provide an input signal to a radio receiver. Field strength meters are used for such applications as cellular, broadcasting, wi-fi and a wide variety of other radio-related applications.

<doc id="41151" wikidata="Q513349" url="?curid=41151" title="File server">
<text>In computing, a file server (or fileserver) is a computer attached to a network that provides a location for shared disk access, i.e. storage of computer files (such as text, image, sound, video) that can be accessed by workstations within a computer network. The term server highlights the role of the machine in the traditional client–server scheme, where the clients are the workstations using the storage. A file server does not normally perform computational tasks or run programs on behalf of its client workstations (in other words, it is different from e.g. an application server, which is another type of server).

File servers are commonly found in schools and offices, where users use a local area network to connect their client computers.

==Types of file servers==
A file server may be dedicated or non-dedicated. A dedicated server is designed specifically for use as a file server, with workstations attached for reading and writing files and databases.

File servers may also be categorized by the method of access: Internet file servers are frequently accessed by File Transfer Protocol or by HTTP (but are different from web servers, that often provide dynamic web content in addition to static files). Servers on a LAN are usually accessed by SMB/CIFS protocol (Windows and Unix-like) or NFS protocol (Unix-like systems).

Database servers, that provide access to a shared database via a database device driver, are not regarded as file servers even when the database is stored in files, as they are not designed to provide those files to users and tend to have differing technical requirements.

==Design of file servers==
In modern businesses, the design of file servers is complicated by competing demands for storage space, access speed, recoverability, ease of administration, security, and budget. This is further complicated by a constantly changing environment, where new hardware and technology rapidly obsolesces old equipment, and yet must seamlessly come online in a fashion compatible with the older machinery. To manage throughput, peak loads, and response time, vendors may utilize queuing theory to model how the combination of hardware and software will respond over various levels of demand. Servers may also employ dynamic load balancing scheme to distribute requests across various pieces of hardware.

The primary piece of hardware equipment for servers over the last couple of decades has proven to be the hard disk drive. Although other forms of storage are viable (such as magnetic tape and solid-state drives) disk drives have continued to offer the best fit for cost, performance, and capacity.

===Storage===
Since the crucial function of a file server is storage, technology has been developed to operate multiple disk drives together as a team, forming a disk array. A disk array typically has cache (temporary memory storage that is faster than the magnetic disks), as well as advanced functions like RAID and storage virtualization. Typically disk arrays increase level of availability by using redundant components other than RAID, such as power supplies. Disk arrays may be consolidated or virtualized in a SAN.

===Network-attached storage===

Network-attached storage (NAS) is file-level computer data storage connected to a computer network providing data access to a heterogeneous group of clients. NAS devices specifically are distinguished from file servers generally in a NAS being a computer appliance – a specialized computer built from the ground up for serving files – rather than a general purpose computer being used for serving files (possibly with other functions). In discussions of NASs, the term &quot;file server&quot; generally stands for a contrasting term, referring to general purpose computers only.

 NAS devices are gaining popularity, offering a convenient method for sharing files between multiple computers. Potential benefits of network-attached storage, compared to non-dedicated file servers, include faster data access, easier administration, and simple configuration.

NAS systems are networked appliances containing one or more hard drives, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID arrays. Network Attached Storage removes the responsibility of file serving from other servers on the network. They typically provide access to files using network file sharing protocols such as NFS, SMB/CIFS (Server Message Block/Common Internet File System), or AFP.

===Security===
File servers generally offer some form of system security to limit access to files to specific users or groups. In large organizations, this is a task usually delegated to directory services, such as openLDAP, Novell&#x27;s eDirectory or Microsoft&#x27;s Active Directory.

These servers work within the hierarchical computing environment which treat users, computers, applications and files as distinct but related entities on the network and grant access based on user or group credentials. In many cases, the directory service spans many file servers, potentially hundreds for large organizations. In the past, and in smaller organizations, authentication could take place directly at the server itself.

<text>In telecommunications, a filled cable is a cable that has a non-hygroscopic material, usually a gel called icky-pick, inside the jacket or sheath. The nonhygroscopic material fills the spaces between the interior parts of the cable, preventing moisture from entering minor leaks in the sheath and migrating inside the cable. 

A metallic cable filled with a dielectric material, such as a coaxial cable or a metal waveguide, is not considered to be a &quot;filled cable&quot;.

<text>In computing, firmware is software that provides low-level control of computing device hardware. 

For a relatively simple device, firmware may perform all control, monitoring and data manipulation functionality.

For a more complex device, firmware may provide relatively low-level control as well as hardware abstraction services to higher-level software such as an operating system.

Firmware is found in a wide range of computing devices including personal computers, smartphones, home appliances, vehicles, computer peripherals and in many of the integrated circuits inside each of these larger systems.

Firmware is stored in non-volatile memory either read-only memory (ROM) or programmable memory such as EPROM, EEPROM, or flash. Changing a device&#x27;s firmware stored in ROM requires physically replacing the memory chip although some chips are not designed to be removed after manufacture. Programmable firmware memory can be reprogrammed via a procedure sometimes called &quot;flashing&quot;.

Common reasons for changing firmware include fixing bugs and adding features.

== History and etymology ==
Ascher Opler used the term &quot;firmware&quot; in a 1967 &quot;Datamation&quot; article, as an intermediary term between &quot;hardware&quot; and &quot;software&quot;. Opler projected that fourth-generation computer systems would have a writable control store (a small specialized high-speed memory) into which microcode firmware would be loaded. Many software functions would be moved to microcode, and instruction sets could be customized, with different firmware loaded for different instruction sets.

As computers began to increase in complexity, it became clear that various programs needed to first be initiated and run to provide a consistent environment necessary for running more complex programs at the user&#x27;s discretion. This required programming the computer to run those programs automatically. Furthermore, as companies, universities, and marketers wanted to sell computers to laypeople with little technical knowledge, greater automation became necessary to allow a lay-user to easily run programs for practical purposes. This gave rise to a kind of software that a user would not consciously run, and it led to software that a lay user wouldn&#x27;t even know about.

As originally used, firmware contrasted with hardware (the CPU itself) and software (normal instructions executing on a CPU). It was not composed of CPU machine instructions, but of lower-level microcode involved in the implementation of machine instructions. It existed on the boundary between hardware and software; thus the name &quot;firmware&quot;. Over time, popular usage extended the word &quot;firmware&quot; to denote any computer program that is tightly linked to hardware, including BIOS on PCs, boot firmware on smartphones, computer peripherals, or the control systems on simple consumer electronic devices such as microwave ovens and remote controls.

== Applications ==

=== Computers ===
In some respects, the various firmware components are as important as the operating system in a working computer. However, unlike most modern operating systems, firmware rarely has a well-evolved automatic mechanism of updating itself to fix any functionality issues detected after shipping the unit.

A computer&#x27;s firmware may be manually updated by a user via a small utility program. In contrast, firmware in mass storage devices (hard-disk drives, optical disc drives, flash memory storage e.g. solid state drive) is less frequently updated, even when flash memory (rather than ROM, EEPROM) storage is used for the firmware.

Most computer peripherals are themselves special-purpose computers. Devices such as printers, scanners, webcams, and USB flash drives have internally-stored firmware; some devices may also permit field upgrading of their firmware. For modern simpler devices, such as USB keyboards, USB mouses and USB sound cards, the trend is to store the firmware in on-chip memory in the device&#x27;s microcontroller, as opposed to storing it in a separate EEPROM chip.

Examples of computer firmware include:
* The BIOS firmware used on PCs
* The (U)EFI-compliant firmware used on Itanium systems, Intel-based Macs, and many newer PCs
* Hard disk drive, solid-state drive, optical disc drive and optical disc recorder firmware
* Video BIOS of a graphics card
* Open Firmware, used in SPARC-based computers from Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corporation, PowerPC-based computers from Apple, and computers from Genesi
* ARCS, used in computers from Silicon Graphics
* Kickstart, used in the Amiga line of computers (POST, hardware init + Plug and Play auto-configuration of peripherals, kernel, etc.)
* RTAS (Run-Time Abstraction Services), used in System i and System p computers from IBM
* The Common Firmware Environment (CFE) for Broadcom systems-on-chip (SoCs)
=== Home and personal-use products ===
Consumer appliances like gaming consoles, digital cameras and portable music players support firmware upgrades. Some companies use firmware updates to add new playable file formats (codecs). Other features that may change with firmware updates include the GUI or even the battery life. Smartphones have a firmware over the air upgrade capability for adding new features and patching security issues.

=== Automobiles ===
Since 1996, most automobiles have employed an on-board computer and various sensors to detect mechanical problems. , modern vehicles also employ computer-controlled anti-lock braking systems (ABS) and computer-operated transmission control units (TCUs). The driver can also get in-dash information while driving in this manner, such as real-time fuel economy and tire pressure readings. Local dealers can update most vehicle firmware.

=== Other examples ===
Other firmware applications include:
* In home and personal-use products:
** Timing and control systems for washing machines
** Controlling sound and video attributes, as well as the channel list, in modern televisions
* In routers, switches, and firewalls:
** LibreCMC a 100% free software router distribution based on the Linux-libre kernel
** IPFire an open-source firewall/router distribution based on the Linux kernel
** fli4l an open-source firewall/router distribution based on the Linux kernel
** OpenWrt an open-source firewall/router distribution based on the Linux kernel
** m0n0wall an embedded firewall distribution of FreeBSD
** Proprietary firmware
* In NAS systems:
** NAS4Free an open-source NAS operating system based on FreeBSD
** Openfiler an open-source NAS operating system based on the Linux kernel
** Proprietary firmware
* Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) code may be referred to as firmware

== Flashing ==
&quot;Flashing&quot; is a process that involves the overwriting of existing firmware or data, contained in EEPROM or flash memory module present in an electronic device, with new data. This can be done to upgrade a device or to change the provider of a service associated with the function of the device, such as changing from one mobile phone service provider to another or installing a new operating system. If firmware is upgradable, it is often done via a program from the provider, and will often allow the old firmware to be saved before upgrading so it can be reverted to if the process fails, or if the newer version performs worse. Free software replacements for vendor flashing tools have been developed, such as Flashrom.

== Firmware hacking ==
Sometimes, third parties develop an unofficial new or modified (&quot;aftermarket&quot;) version of firmware to provide new features or to unlock hidden functionality; this is referred to as custom firmware. An example is Rockbox as a firmware replacement for portable media players. There are many homebrew projects for various devices, which often unlock general-purpose computing functionality in previously limited devices (e.g., running Doom on iPods).

Firmware hacks usually take advantage of the firmware update facility on many devices to install or run themselves. Some, however, must resort to exploits to run, because the manufacturer has attempted to lock the hardware to stop it from running unlicensed code.

Most firmware hacks are free software.

=== HDD firmware hacks ===
The Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab discovered that a group of developers it refers to as the Equation Group has developed hard disk drive firmware modifications for various drive models, containing a trojan horse that allows data to be stored on the drive in locations that will not be erased even if the drive is formatted or wiped. Although the Kaspersky Lab report did not explicitly claim that this group is part of the United States National Security Agency (NSA), evidence obtained from the code of various Equation Group software suggests that they are part of the NSA.

Researchers from the Kaspersky Lab categorized the undertakings by Equation Group as the most advanced hacking operation ever uncovered, also documenting around 500 infections caused by the Equation Group in at least 42 countries.

== Security risks ==
Mark Shuttleworth, the founder of the company Canonical, which created the Ubuntu Linux distribution, has described proprietary firmware as a security risk, saying that &quot;firmware on your device is the NSA&#x27;s best friend&quot; and calling firmware &quot;a trojan horse of monumental proportions&quot;. He has asserted that low-quality, closed source firmware is a major threat to system security: &quot;Your biggest mistake is to assume that the NSA is the only institution abusing this position of trust in fact, it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that all firmware is a cesspool of insecurity, courtesy of incompetence of the highest degree from manufacturers, and competence of the highest degree from a very wide range of such agencies&quot;. As a potential solution to this problem, he has called for declarative firmware, which would describe &quot;hardware linkage and dependencies&quot; and &quot;should not include executable code&quot;. Firmware should be open-source so that the code can be checked and verified.

Custom firmware hacks have also focused on injecting malware into devices such as smartphones or USB devices. One such smartphone injection was demonstrated on the Symbian OS at MalCon, a hacker convention. A USB device firmware hack called BadUSB was presented at the Black Hat USA 2014 conference, demonstrating how a USB flash drive microcontroller can be reprogrammed to spoof various other device types to take control of a computer, exfiltrate data, or spy on the user. Other security researchers have worked further on how to exploit the principles behind BadUSB, releasing at the same time the source code of hacking tools that can be used to modify the behavior of different USB devices.

<text>In a telephone network, flood search routing is non-deterministic routing in which a dialed number received at a switch is transmitted to all switches, &quot;i.e.,&quot; flooded, in the area code directly connected to that switch; if the dialed number is not an affiliated subscriber at that switch, the number is then retransmitted to all directly connected switches, and then routed through the switch that has the dialed number corresponding to the particular user end instrument affiliated with it. All digits of the numbering plan are used to identify a particular subscriber. Flood search routing allows subscribers to have telephone numbers independent of switch codes. Flood search routing provides the highest probability that a telephone call will go through even though a number of switches and links fail.

Flood search routing is used in military telecommunication systems, such as the mobile subscriber equipment (MSE) system.

<text>In electronics and communication, flutter is the rapid variation of signal parameters, such as amplitude, phase, and frequency. Examples of electronic flutter are:

*Rapid variations in received signal levels, such as variations that may be caused by atmospheric disturbances, antenna movements in a high wind, or interaction with other signals.
*In radio propagation, a phenomenon in which nearly all radio signals that are usually reflected by ionospheric layers in or above the E-region experience partial or complete absorption.
*In radio transmission, rapidly changing signal levels, together with variable multipath time delays, caused by reflection and possible partial absorption of the signal by aircraft flying through the radio beam or common scatter volume.
*The variation in the transmission characteristics of a loaded telephone line caused by the action of telegraph direct currents on the loading coils.
*In recording and reproducing equipment, the deviation of frequency caused by irregular mechanical motion, &quot;e.g.,&quot; that of capstan angular velocity in a tape transport mechanism, during operation.

<text>The flywheel effect is the continuation of oscillations in an oscillator circuit after the control stimulus has been removed. This is usually caused by interacting inductive and capacitive elements in the oscillator. Circuits undergoing such oscillations are said to be flywheeling.

The flywheel effect may be desirable, such as in phase-locked loops used in synchronous systems, or undesirable, such as in voltage-controlled oscillators.

Flywheel effect is used in Class C modulation where efficiency of modulation can be achieved as high as 90%.

<text>Foreign instrumentation signals intelligence, FISINT (&quot;F&quot;oreign &quot;I&quot;nstrumentation &quot;S&quot;ignature &quot;INT&quot;elligence) is intelligence from the interception of foreign electromagnetic emissions associated with the testing and operational deployment of foreign aerospace, surface, and subsurface systems. Since it deals with signals that have communicational content, it is a subset of Communications Intelligence (COMINT), which, in turn, is a subset of SIGINT. Unlike general COMINT signals, the content of FISINT signals is not in regular human language, but rather in machine to machine (instrumentation) language or in a combination of regular human language and instrumentation language. FISINT is also considered as a subset of MASINT (measurement and signature intelligence).

Typical examples of such communication include:
*Telemetry data (TELINT). Missiles, satellites and other remotely monitored devices often transmit streams of data concerning their location, speed, engine status and other metrics.
*Video data links. These may be from UAVs or from satellites used for reconnaissance.
*Remote access and control transmissions, such as from remote keyless systems and wireless traffic light control systems.
*Command signals used in teleoperation, such as the control of aerial vehicles, missiles and remotely-controlled robots.

==Telecommunications==

In telecommunications, the term FISINT has the following meanings: 
# Intelligence information derived from electromagnetic emissions associated with the testing and operational deployment of foreign aerospace, surface, and subsurface systems. 
#Technical information and intelligence information derived from the intercept of foreign instrumentation signals by other than the intended recipients. Foreign instrumentation signals intelligence is a category of signals intelligence. 

Foreign instrumentation signals include but are not limited to signals from telemetry, beaconry, electronic interrogators, tracking/fusing/arming/firing command systems, and video data links.

<text>In telecommunications, a forward echo is the propagation of a signal reflection in the same direction as the original signal and consisting of energy reflected back by one discontinuity and then forward again by another discontinuity. Forward echoes can be supported by reflections caused by splices or other discontinuities in the transmission medium (e.g. optical fiber, twisted pair, or coaxial tube). In metallic lines, they may be supported by impedance mismatches between the source or load and the characteristic impedance of the transmission medium. They may cause attenuation distortion.

<doc id="41168" wikidata="Q5473287" url="?curid=41168" title="Forward scatter">
<text>Forward scattering is the deflection of waves by small angles so that they continue to move in close to the same direction as before the scattering. It can occur with all types of waves, for instance light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays as well as matter waves such as electrons, neutrons and even water waves. It can be due to diffraction, refraction, and low angle reflection. It almost always occurs when the wavelength of the radiation used is small relative to the features which lead to the scattering. Forward scatter is essentially the reverse of backscatter.

Many different examples exist, and there are very large fields where forward scattering dominates, in particular for electron diffraction and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction. In these the relevant waves are transmitted through the samples. One case where there is forward scattering in a reflection geometry is reflection high-energy electron diffraction.
== General description ==
Whenever waves encounter obstacles of any type there are changes in the direction of the waves (wave vector) by diffraction, and sometimes its energy by inelastic scattering. These processes occur for all types of waves, although how they behave varies with both their type and that of the obstacle. As illustrated in the figure, if the change in the wave vector q is fairly small the scattered wave moves in close to the same direction as the input—it has been scattered. In most cases the change in the wave vector scales inversely with the size of obstacles, so forward scattering is more common when the obstacles are large compared to the wavelength of the radiation.

In many cases the waves of interest have relatively small wavelengths, for instance high-energy electrons or X-rays. However, the process is very general and can also be seen when water flows through a narrow channel as shown in the figure at the Blue Lagoon.

== Comets ==
Forward scattering can make a back-lit comet appear significantly brighter because the dust and ice crystals are reflecting and enhancing the apparent brightness of the comet by scattering that light towards the observer. Comets studied forward-scattering in visible-thermal photometry include C/1927 X1 (Skjellerup–Maristany), C/1975 V1 (West), and C/1980 Y1 (Bradfield). Comets studied forward-scattering in SOHO non-thermal C3 coronograph photometry include 96P/Machholz and C/2004 F4 (Bradfield). The brightness of the great comets C/2006 P1 (McNaught) and Comet Skjellerup–Maristany near perihelion were enhanced by forward scattering.

<text>Frequency of optimum transmission (FOT), in the transmission of radio waves via ionospheric reflection, is the highest effective (i.e. working) frequency that is predicted to be usable for a specified path and time for 90% of the days of the month. The FOT is normally just below the value of the maximum usable frequency (MUF). In the prediction of usable frequencies, the FOT is commonly taken as 15% below the monthly median value of the MUF for the specified time and path. 

The FOT is usually the most effective frequency for ionospheric reflection of radio waves between two specified points on Earth.

<text>In telecommunications, a four-wire circuit is a two-way circuit using two paths so arranged that the respective signals are transmitted in one direction only by one path and in the other direction by the other path. The four-wire circuit gets its name from the fact that is uses four conductors to create two complete electrical circuits, one for each direction. The two separate circuits (channels) allow full-duplex operation with low crosstalk.

In telephony a four-wire circuit was historically used to transport and switch baseband audio signals in the phone company telephone exchange before the advent of digital modulation and the electronic switching system eliminated baseband audio from the telco plant except for the local loop. The local loop is a two-wire circuit for one reason only: to save copper. Using half the number of copper wire conductors per circuit means that the infrastructure cost for wiring each circuit is halved. Although a lower quality circuit, the local loop allows full duplex operation by using a telephone hybrid to keep near and far voice levels equivalent.

As the public switched telephone network expanded in size and scope, using many individual wires inside the telco plant became so impractical and labor-intensive that in-office and inter-office signal wiring progressed to high bandwidth coaxial cable (still a popular interconnection method in the 21st century, used with the Lucent 5ESS Class-5 telephone switch to present day), microwave radio relay and ultimately fiber-optic communication for high-speed trunk circuits. At the end of the 20th century, four-wire circuits saw renewed growth for corporate local loop service for use in dedicated line service for computer modems to interconnect company computer networks and to connect networks to an Internet service provider for Internet connectivity before commodity DSL and cable modem connectivity was widely available.

<text>A four-wire terminating set (4WTS) is a balanced transformer used to perform a conversion between four-wire and two-wire operation in telecommunication systems.

For example, a 4-wire circuit may, by means of a 4-wire terminating set, be connected to a 2-wire telephone set. Also, a pair of 4-wire terminating sets may be used to introduce an intermediate 4-wire circuit into a 2-wire circuit, in which loop repeaters may be situated to amplify signals in each direction without positive feedback and oscillation. 

The 4WTS differs from a simple hybrid coil in being equipped to adjust its impedance to maximize return loss.

Four-wire terminating sets were largely supplanted by resistance hybrids in the late 20th century.

<text>A frame is a digital data transmission unit in computer networking and telecommunications. In packet switched systems, a frame is a simple container for a single network packet. In other telecommunications systems, a frame is a repeating structure supporting time-division multiplexing.

A frame typically includes frame synchronization features consisting of a sequence of bits or symbols that indicate to the receiver the beginning and end of the payload data within the stream of symbols or bits it receives. If a receiver is connected to the system during frame transmission, it ignores the data until it detects a new frame synchronization sequence.

==Packet switching==
In the OSI model of computer networking, a frame is the protocol data unit at the data link layer. Frames are the result of the final layer of encapsulation before the data is transmitted over the physical layer. A frame is &quot;the unit of transmission in a link layer protocol, and consists of a link layer header followed by a packet.&quot; Each frame is separated from the next by an interframe gap. A frame is a series of bits generally composed of frame synchronization bits, the packet payload, and a frame check sequence. Examples are Ethernet frames, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) frames, Fibre Channel frames, and V.42 modem frames.

Often, frames of several different sizes are nested inside each other. For example, when using Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) over asynchronous serial communication, the eight bits of each individual byte are framed by start and stop bits, the payload data bytes in a network packet are framed by the header and footer, and several packets can be framed with frame boundary octets.

==Time-division multiplex==
In telecommunications, specifically in time-division multiplex (TDM) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) variants, a frame is a cyclically repeated data block that consists of a fixed number of time slots, one for each logical TDM channel or TDMA transmitter. In this context, a frame is typically an entity at the physical layer. TDM application examples are SONET/SDH and the ISDN circuit-switched B-channel, while TDMA examples are Circuit Switched Data used in early cellular voice services. The frame is also an entity for time-division duplex, where the mobile terminal may transmit during some time slots and receive during others.

<doc id="41173" wikidata="Q119565" url="?curid=41173" title="Frame rate">
<text>Frame rate, most commonly expressed in frame/s, &#x27; or FPS, is typically the frequency (rate) at which consecutive images (frames) are captured or displayed. This definition applies to film and video cameras, computer animation, and motion capture systems. In these contexts, frame rate may be used interchangeably with &#x27; and refresh rate, which are expressed in hertz. Additionally, in the context of computer graphics performance, FPS is the rate at which a system, particularly a GPU, is able to generate frames, and refresh rate is the frequency at which a display shows completed frames. In electronic camera specifications frame rate refers to the maximum possible rate frames could be captured, but in practice, other settings (such as exposure time) may reduce the actual frequency to a lower number than the frame rate.

==Human vision==

The temporal sensitivity and resolution of human vision varies depending on the type and characteristics of visual stimulus, and it differs between individuals. The human visual system can process 10 to 12 images per second and perceive them individually, while higher rates are perceived as motion. Modulated light (such as a computer display) is perceived as stable by the majority of participants in studies when the rate is higher than 50 Hz. This perception of modulated light as steady is known as the flicker fusion threshold. However, when the modulated light is non-uniform and contains an image, the flicker fusion threshold can be much higher, in the hundreds of hertz. With regard to image recognition, people have been found to recognize a specific image in an unbroken series of different images, each of which lasts as little as 13 milliseconds. Persistence of vision sometimes accounts for very short single-millisecond visual stimulus having a perceived duration of between 100 ms and 400 ms. Multiple stimuli that are very short are sometimes perceived as a single stimulus, such as a 10 ms green flash of light immediately followed by a 10 ms red flash of light perceived as a single yellow flash of light.

==Film and video==
===Silent film===
Early silent films had stated frame rates anywhere from 16 to 24 frames per second (FPS), but since the cameras were hand-cranked, the rate often changed during the scene to fit the mood. Projectionists could also change the frame rate in the theater by adjusting a rheostat controlling the voltage powering the film-carrying mechanism in the projector. Film companies often intended for theaters to show their silent films at a higher frame rate than that at which they were filmed. These frame rates were enough for the sense of motion, but it was perceived as jerky motion. To minimize the perceived flicker, projectors employed dual- and triple-blade shutters, so each frame was displayed two or three times, increasing the flicker rate to 48 or 72 hertz and reducing eye strain. Thomas Edison said that 46 frames per second was the minimum needed for the eye to perceive motion: &quot;Anything less will strain the eye.&quot; In the mid to late 1920s, the frame rate for silent film increased to 20–26 FPS.

===Sound film===
When sound film was introduced in 1926, variations in film speed were no longer tolerated, as the human ear is more sensitive than the eye to changes in frequency. Many theaters had shown silent films at 22 to 26 FPS, which is why the industry chose 24 FPS for sound film as a compromise. From 1927 to 1930, as various studios updated equipment, the rate of 24 FPS became standard for 35 mm sound film. At 24 FPS, the film travels through the projector at a rate of per second. This allowed simple two-blade shutters to give a projected series of images at 48 per second, satisfying Edison&#x27;s recommendation. Many modern 35 mm film projectors use three-blade shutters to give 72 images per second—each frame is flashed on screen three times.

===Animation===
In drawn animation, moving characters are often shot &quot;on twos&quot;, that is to say, one drawing is shown for every two frames of film (which usually runs at 24 frame per second), meaning there are only 12 drawings per second. Even though the image update rate is low, the fluidity is satisfactory for most subjects. However, when a character is required to perform a quick movement, it is usually necessary to revert to animating &quot;on ones&quot;, as &quot;twos&quot; are too slow to convey the motion adequately. A blend of the two techniques keeps the eye fooled without unnecessary production cost.

Animation for most &quot;Saturday morning cartoons&quot; was produced as cheaply as possible and was most often shot on &quot;threes&quot; or even &quot;fours&quot;, i.e. three or four frames per drawing. This translates to only 8 or 6 drawings per second respectively. Anime is also usually drawn on threes or twos.

===Modern video standards===

Due to the mains frequency of electric grids, analog television broadcast was developed with frame rates of 50 Hz (most of the world) or 60 Hz (Canada, US, Mexico, Philippines, Japan, South Korea). The frequency of the electricity grid was extremely stable and therefore it was logical to use for synchronization.

The introduction of color television technology made it necessary to lower that 60 FPS frequency by 0.1% to avoid &quot;dot crawl&quot;, a display artifact appearing on legacy black-and-white displays, showing up on highly-color-saturated surfaces. It was found that by lowering the frame rate by 0.1%, the undesirable effect was minimized.

, video transmission standards in North America, Japan, and South Korea are still based on 60/1.001 ≈ 59.94 images per second. Two sizes of images are typically used: 1920×1080 (&quot;1080i/p&quot;) and 1280×720 (&quot;720p&quot;). Confusingly, &quot;interlaced&quot; formats are customarily stated at 1/2 their image rate, 29.97/25 FPS, and &quot;double&quot; their image height, but these statements are purely custom; in each format, 60 images per second are produced. A resolution of 1080i produces 59.94 or 50 1920×540 images, each squashed to half-height in the photographic process and stretched back to fill the screen on playback in a television set. The 720p format produces 59.94/50 or 29.97/25 1280×720p images, not squeezed, so that no expansion or squeezing of the image is necessary. This confusion was industry-wide in the early days of digital video software, with much software being written incorrectly, the developers believing that only 29.97 images were expected each second, which was incorrect. While it was true that each picture element was polled and sent only 29.97 times per second, the pixel location immediately below that one was polled 1/60 of a second later, part of a completely separate image for the next 1/60-second frame.

At its native 24 FPS rate, film could not be displayed on 60 Hz video without the necessary pulldown process, often leading to &quot;judder&quot;: to convert 24 frames per second into 60 frames per second, every odd frame is repeated, playing twice, while every even frame is tripled. This creates uneven motion, appearing stroboscopic. Other conversions have similar uneven frame doubling. Newer video standards support 120, 240, or 300 frames per second, so frames can be evenly sampled for standard frame rates such as 24, 48 and 60 FPS film or 25, 30, 50 or 60 FPS video. Of course these higher frame rates may also be displayed at their native rates.

===Electronic camera specifications===
In electronic camera specifications frame rate refers to the maximum possible rate frames that can be captured (e.g. if the exposure time were set to near-zero), but in practice, other settings (such as exposure time) may reduce the actual frequency to a lower number than the frame rate.

== Computer games ==
In computer video games, frame rate plays an important part in the experience as, unlike film, games are rendered in real-time. 60 frames per second has for a long time been considered the minimum frame rate for smoothly animated game play. Video games designed for PAL markets, before the sixth generation of video game consoles, had lower frame rates by design due to the 50 Hz output. This noticeably made fast-paced games, such as racing or fighting games, run slower. Computer monitors marketed to competitive PC gamers can hit 360 Hz, 500 Hz, or more. High frame rates make action scenes look less blurry, such as sprinting through the wilderness in an open world game, spinning rapidly to face an opponent in a first-person shooter, or keeping track of details during an intense fight in a multiplayer online battle arena. Input latency is also reduced. Some people may have difficulty perceiving the differences between high frame rates, though.

Frame time is related to frame rate, but it measures the time between frames. A game could maintain an average of 60 frames per second but appear choppy because of a poor frame time. Game reviews sometimes average the worst 1% of frame rates, reported as the 99th percentile, to measure how choppy the game appears. A small difference between the average frame rate and 99th percentile would generally indicate a smooth experience. To mitigate the choppiness of poorly optimized games, players can set frame rate caps closer to their 99% percentile.

When a game&#x27;s frame rate is different than the display&#x27;s refresh rate, screen tearing can occur. Vsync mitigates this, but it caps the frame rate to the display&#x27;s refresh rate, increases input lag, and introduces judder. Variable refresh rate displays automatically set their refresh rate equal to the game&#x27;s frame rate, as long as it is within the display&#x27;s supported range.

==Frame rate up-conversion==
Frame rate up-conversion (FRC) is the process of increasing the temporal resolution of a video sequence by synthesizing one or more intermediate frames between two consecutive frames. A low frame rate causes aliasing, yields abrupt motion artifacts, and degrades the video quality. Consequently, the temporal resolution is an important factor affecting video quality. Algorithms for FRC are widely used in applications, including visual quality enhancement, video compression and slow-motion video generation.

===Methods===
Most FRC methods can be categorized into optical flow or kernel-based and pixel hallucination-based methods.

====Flow-based FRC====
Flow-based methods linearly combine predicted optical flows between two input frames to approximate flows from the target intermediate frame to the input frames. They also propose flow reversal (projection) for more accurate image warping. Moreover, there are algorithms that give different weights of overlapped flow vectors depending on the object depth of the scene via a flow projection layer.

====Pixel hallucination-based FRC====
Pixel hallucination-based methods use deformable convolution to the center frame generator by replacing optical flows with offset vectors. There are algorithms that also interpolate middle frames with the help of deformable convolution in the feature domain. However, since these methods directly hallucinate pixels unlike the flow-based FRC methods, the predicted frames tend to be blurry when fast-moving objects are present.

<text>The Constitution of the State of Vermont is the fundamental body of law of the U.S. state of Vermont, describing and framing its government. It was adopted in 1793 following Vermont&#x27;s admission to the Union in 1791 and is largely based upon the 1777 Constitution of the Vermont Republic which was drafted at Windsor in the Old Constitution House and amended in 1786. At 8,295 words, it is the shortest U.S. state constitution. Largely unchanged since 1777, Vermont&#x27;s Constitution is the only active constitutional document to have been drafted and ratified outside of the United States.

==History==

=== 1777 ===
From 1777 to 1791, Vermont was an independent country, often referred to in the present day as the Vermont Republic. During that time it was usually called the State of Vermont but sometimes called the Commonwealth of Vermont or the Republic of Vermont. Its first constitution, drafted in 1777, was among the most far-reaching in guaranteeing personal freedoms and individual rights. In particular, it banned adult slavery, saying male slaves become free at the age of 21 and females at 18. The 1777 constitution&#x27;s Declaration of Rights of the Inhabitants of the State of Vermont anticipated the United States Bill of Rights by a dozen years. The first chapter, a &quot;Declaration of Rights of the Inhabitants of the State of Vermont&quot;, is followed by a &quot;Plan or Frame of Government&quot; outlining the structure of governance. It provided that the governor would be elected by the freemen of the state, who could vote regardless of whether they owned property, that each town would be represented in the legislative assembly, that there would be a court of law in each county, and that the legislative assembly and the governor&#x27;s council would jointly hold legislative power.

=== 1786 ===

In 1786, the Constitution was extensively revised to establish a far greater separation of powers than what had prevailed under the 1777 Constitution. In particular, it forbade anyone to simultaneously hold more than one of certain offices, including those of judges, legislators, members of the governor&#x27;s council, the governor, and the surveyor-general. It also provided that the legislature could no longer function as a court of appeals nor otherwise intervene in cases before the courts, as it had often done.

The 1786 Constitution continued in effect when, in 1791, Vermont made the transition from independence to the status of one of the states of the Union. In particular, the governor, the members of the governor&#x27;s council, and other officers of the state, including judges in all courts, simply continued their terms of office that were already underway.

=== 1793 ===

The 1793 Constitution was adopted two years after Vermont&#x27;s admission to the Union and continues in effect, with various later amendments, to this day. It eliminated all mention of grievances against King George III and against the State of New York. In 1790, New York&#x27;s legislature finally renounced its claims that Vermont was a part of New York, the cessation of those claims being effective if and when Congress decided to admit Vermont to the Union.
Vermont held constitutional conventions in 1777, 1786, 1793, 1814, 1822, 1828, 1836, 1843, 1850, 1857, and 1870.

==Council of Censors==
&quot;In order that the freedom of this Commonwealth may be preserved inviolate&quot; the 1777 constitution established a Council of Censors. This body consisted of thirteen elected members, chosen every seven years, but not from the Council or General Assembly. They were to check that &quot;the legislative and executive branches of government have performed their duty as guardians of the people&quot;. They also had the power to call a convention, if needed, to amend the constitution. This council had been based on a similar element of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776.
In 1786, the constitution was amended with language proposed by the 1785 Council of Censors, their first meeting, and adopted by the 1786 Constitutional Convention. The section on the Council of Censors remained generally unchanged, with only an added clarification of scope.
In 1793, the constitution was amended with language proposed by the 1792 Council of Censors and adopted by the 1793 Constitutional Convention. The Council now had the &quot;power to send for persons, papers, and records&quot;.
In 1870, the constitution was amended with language proposed by the 1869 Council of Censors, their last meeting, and adopted by the 1870 Constitutional Convention. The Council of Censors was abolished and replaced by a new procedure to amend the constitution.

==Amending the constitution==

The Vermont Constitution, Chapter 2, Section 72 establishes the procedure for amending the constitution. The Vermont General Assembly, the state&#x27;s bi-cameral legislature, has the sole power to propose amendments to the Constitution of Vermont. The process must be initiated by a Senate that has been elected in an &quot;off-year&quot;, that is, an election that does not coincide with the election of the U.S. president. An amendment must originate in the Senate and be approved by a two-thirds vote. It must then receive a majority vote in the House. Then, after a newly elected legislature is seated, the amendment must receive a majority vote in each chamber, first in the Senate, then in the House. The proposed amendment must then be presented to the voters as a referendum and receive a majority of the votes cast.

==1990s revision to gender-neutral language==
In 1991 and again in 1993, the Vermont General Assembly approved a constitutional amendment authorizing the justices of the Vermont Supreme Court to revise the Constitution in &quot;gender-inclusive&quot; language, replacing gender-specific terms. (Examples: &quot;men&quot; and &quot;women&quot; were replaced by &quot;persons&quot;, and the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Oath,&quot; required of all newly registered voters in the state, was renamed the &quot;Voters&#x27; Oath&quot;). The revision was ratified by the voters in the general election of November 8, 1994. Vermont is one of six states whose constitutions are written in gender-neutral language.

<text>In the reception of framed data, a frame slip is the loss of synchronization between a received frame and the receiver clock signal, causing a frame misalignment event, and resulting in the loss of the data contained in the received frame. 

A frame slip should not be confused with a dropped frame where synchronization is not lost, as in the case of buffer overflow, for example.

<doc id="41176" wikidata="Q5477933" url="?curid=41176" title="Frame synchronization">
<text>In telecommunications, frame synchronization or framing is the process by which, while receiving a stream of fixed-length frames, the receiver identifies the frame boundaries, permitting the data bits within the frame to be extracted for decoding or retransmission.

When packets of varying length are sent, it is necessary to have an instantly recognizable packet-end delimiter (e.g., Ethernet&#x27;s end of stream symbol). Loss of carrier signal can be interpreted as a packet-end delimiter in some cases. When a continuous stream of fixed-length frames are sent, a synchronized receiver can in principle identify frame boundaries forever. In practice, receivers can usually maintain synchronization despite transmission errors; bit slips are much rarer than bit errors. Thus, it is acceptable to use a much smaller frame boundary marker, at the expense of a lengthier process to establish synchronization in the first place.

Frame synchronization is achieved when the incoming frame alignment signals are identified (that is, distinguished from data bits), permitting the data bits within the frame to be extracted for decoding or retransmission.

== Framing ==

If the transmission is temporarily interrupted, or a bit slip event occurs, the receiver must re-synchronize.
The transmitter and the receiver must agree ahead of time on which frame synchronization scheme they will use.

Common frame synchronization schemes are:

;Framing bit: A common practice in telecommunications, for example in T-carrier, is to insert, in a dedicated time slot within the frame, a noninformation framing bit that is used for synchronization of the incoming data with the receiver. In a bit stream, framing bits are predictable (do not carry information), and occur at specified positions in the frame. Correct framing is verified when almost all framing bits (minus a small allowance for transmission errors) have their predicted values.
;Syncword and flag sequence framing: Rather than a single bit, some systems use a multi-bit syncword in each frame, or a flag sequence that marks the beginning and end of each frame. High-Level Data Link Control and similar systems use flag sequences.
;CRC-based framing: Some telecommunications hardware uses CRC-based framing, where correct framing is verified when almost all frames have valid CRCs.

==Frame synchronizer==
In telemetry applications, a &quot;frame synchronizer&quot; is used to locate frame boundaries within a serial pulse-code modulated (PCM) binary stream.

The frame synchronizer immediately follows the bit synchronizer in most telemetry applications. Without frame synchronization, decommutation is impossible.

The frame synchronizer searches the incoming bit-stream for occurrences of the frame synchronization pattern. If the pattern persists for long enough that an accidental match is implausible, the synchronizer declares the data synchronized and available for decoding. If a large number of mis-matches occur, the synchronizer declares a loss of synchronization.

The search can be sequential (only consider one starting point at a time), or multiple candidate starting points may be considered at once. Advanced techniques continue searching even while synchronization is established, so that, if synchronization is lost, by the time the loss is noticed a new frame start position has been found.

It is not uncommon to have multiple levels of frame synchronization, where a series of frames is assembled into a larger &quot;superframe&quot; or &quot;major frame&quot;. Individual frames are then &quot;minor frames&quot; within that superframe. Each frame contains a subframe ID (often a simple counter) which identifies its position within the superframe. A second frame synchronizer establishes superframe synchronization. This allows subcommutation, where some data is sent less frequently than every frame.

<doc id="41179" wikidata="Q477992" url="?curid=41179" title="Free-space path loss">
<text>In telecommunications, the free-space path loss (FSPL) (also known as free-space loss, FSL) is the attenuation of radio energy between the feedpoints of two antennas that results from the combination of the receiving antenna&#x27;s capture area plus the obstacle-free, line-of-sight (LoS) path through free space (usually air). The &quot;Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas&quot;, IEEE Std 145-1993, defines free-space loss as &quot;The loss between two isotropic radiators in free space, expressed as a power ratio.&quot; It does not include any power loss in the antennas themselves due to imperfections such as resistance. Free-space loss increases with the square of distance between the antennas because the radio waves spread out by the inverse square law and decreases with the square of the wavelength of the radio waves. The FSPL is rarely used standalone, but rather as a part of the Friis transmission formula, which includes the gain of antennas. It is a factor that must be included in the power link budget of a radio communication system, to ensure that sufficient radio power reaches the receiver such that the transmitted signal is received intelligibly.

== Free-space path loss formula ==
The free-space path loss (FSPL) formula derives from the Friis transmission formula. This states that in a radio system consisting of a transmitting antenna transmitting radio waves to a receiving antenna, the ratio of radio wave power received formula_1 to the power transmitted formula_2 is:
:formula_3
where
*formula_4 is the directivity of the transmitting antenna
*formula_5 is the directivity of the receiving antenna
*formula_6 is the signal wavelength
*formula_7 is the distance between the antennas
The distance between the antennas formula_8 must be large enough that the antennas are in the far field of each other formula_9.
The free-space path loss is the loss factor in this equation that is due to distance and wavelength, or in other words, the ratio of power transmitted to power received assuming the antennas are isotropic and have no directivity (formula_10): 
formula_11

Since the frequency of a radio wave formula_12 is equal to the speed of light formula_13 divided by the wavelength, the path loss can also be written in terms of frequency: 
formula_14

Beside the assumption that the antennas are lossless, this formula assumes that the polarization of the antennas is the same, that there are no multipath effects, and that the radio wave path is sufficiently far away from obstructions that it acts as if it is in free space. This last restriction requires an ellipsoidal area around the line of sight out to 0.6 of the Fresnel zone be clear of obstructions. The Fresnel zone increases in diameter with the wavelength of the radio waves. Often the concept of free space path loss is applied to radio systems that don&#x27;t completely meet these requirements, but these imperfections can be accounted for by small constant power loss factors that can be included in the link budget.

==Influence of distance and frequency==

The free-space loss increases with the distance between the antennas and decreases with the wavelength of the radio waves due to these factors:
*Intensity (formula_15) – the power density of the radio waves decreases with the square of distance from the transmitting antenna due to spreading of the electromagnetic energy in space according to the inverse square law
*Antenna capture area (formula_16) – the amount of power the receiving antenna captures from the radiation field is proportional to a factor called the &quot;antenna aperture&quot; or antenna capture area, which increases with the square of wavelength. Since this factor is not related to the radio wave path but comes from the receiving antenna, the term &quot;free-space path loss&quot; is a little misleading.
*Directivity of receiving antenna- while the above formulas are correct, the presence of Directivities Dt and Dr builds the wrong intuition in the FSPL Friis transmission formula. The formula seems to say that &quot;free space path loss&quot; increases with frequency in vacuum, which is misleading. The frequency dependence of path loss does not come from free space propagation, but rather from receiving antenna capture area frequency dependence. As frequency increases, the directivity of an antenna of a given physical size will increase. In order to keep receiver antenna directivity constant in the formula, the antenna size must be reduced, and a smaller size antenna results in less power being received as it is able to capture less power with a smaller area. In other words, the path loss increases with frequency because the antenna size is reduced to keep directivity constant in the formula, and has nothing to do with propagation in vacuum. 
*Directivity of transmitting antenna - the directivity of transmitting antenna does not have the same role as directivity of receiving antenna. The difference is that the receiving antenna is receiving the power from free space, and hence captures less power as it becomes smaller. The transmitting antenna does not transmit less power as it becomes smaller (for example half wave dipole), because it is receiving its RF power from a generator or source, and if the source is 1 Watt or Pt, the antenna will transmit all of it (assuming ideal efficiency and VSWR for simplicity).

* System Loss Factor (L) : Miscellaneous loses or system loses (L=&gt;1) are usually due to transmission line attenuation, filter loses, and antenna loses in communication system. A value of L = 1 indicates no loss in the system hardware.

==Derivation==
The radio waves from the transmitting antenna spread out in a spherical wavefront. The amount of power passing through any sphere centered on the transmitting antenna is equal. The surface area of a sphere of radius formula_8 is formula_18. Thus the intensity or power density of the radiation in any particular direction from the antenna is inversely proportional to the square of distance 
:formula_19
(The term formula_18 means the surface of a sphere, which has a radius formula_8. Please remember, that formula_8 here has a meaning of &#x27;distance&#x27; between the two antennas, and does not mean the diameter of the sphere (as notation usually used in mathematics).) 
For an isotropic antenna which radiates equal power in all directions, the power density is evenly distributed over the surface of a sphere centered on the antenna
:formula_23
The amount of power the receiving antenna receives from this radiation field is 
:formula_24
The factor formula_16, called the &quot;effective area&quot; or &quot;aperture&quot; of the receiving antenna, which has the units of area, can be thought of as the amount of area perpendicular to the direction of the radio waves from which the receiving antenna captures energy. Since the linear dimensions of an antenna scale with the wavelength formula_26, the cross sectional area of an antenna and thus the aperture scales with the square of wavelength formula_27. The effective area of an isotropic antenna (for a derivation of this see antenna aperture article) is 
:formula_28
Combining the above (1) and (2), for isotropic antennas
:formula_29 
:formula_30

== Free-space path loss in decibels ==

A convenient way to express FSPL is in terms of decibels (dB):
:formula_31
using SI units of meters for formula_8, hertz (s−1) for formula_12, and meters per second (m⋅s−1) for formula_13, (where c=299 792 458 m/s in vacuum, ≈ 300 000 km/s)

For typical radio applications, it is common to find formula_8 measured in kilometers and formula_12 in gigahertz, in which case the FSPL equation becomes
:formula_37
an increase of 240 dB, because the units increase by factors of and respectively, so:
:formula_38

(The constants differ in the second decimal digit when the speed of light is approximated by 300 000 km/s. Whether one uses 92.4, 92.44 or 92.45 dB, the result will be OK as the average measurement instruments cannot provide more accurate results anyway. A logarithmic scale is introduced to see the important differences (i.e. order of magnitudes), so in engineering practice dB results are rounded)

<text>Freeze frame television is television in which the frames of the video are transmitted as a sequence of still images at a rate far too slow to be perceived as continuous motion by human vision. The receiving device typically displays each frame until the next complete frame is available.

For an image of specified quality, &quot;e.g.&quot;, resolution and color depth, freeze-frame television has a lower bandwidth requirement than that of full-motion television. For this reason, NASA, which refers to this technique as &quot;sequential still video&quot;, uses it on UHF when Ku band full-motion video signals are not available.

<doc id="41181" wikidata="Q2301494" url="?curid=41181" title="F region">
<text>The F region of the ionosphere is home to the F layer of ionization, also called the Appleton–Barnett layer, after the English physicist Edward Appleton and New Zealand physicist and meteorologist Miles Barnett. As with other ionospheric sectors, &#x27;layer&#x27; implies a concentration of plasma, while &#x27;region&#x27; is the volume that contains the said layer. The F region contains ionized gases at a height of around 150–800 km (100 to 500 miles) above sea level, placing it in the Earth&#x27;s thermosphere, a hot region in the upper atmosphere, and also in the heterosphere, where chemical composition varies with height. Generally speaking, the F region has the highest concentration of free electrons and ions anywhere in the atmosphere. It may be thought of as comprising two layers, the F1 and F2 layers.

The F-region is located directly above the E region (formerly the Kennelly-Heaviside layer) and below the protonosphere. It acts as a dependable reflector of HF radio signals as it is not affected by atmospheric conditions, although its ionic composition varies with the sunspot cycle. It reflects normal-incident frequencies at or below the critical frequency (approximately 10 MHz) and partially absorbs waves of higher frequency.

==F1 and F2 layers==
The F1 layer is the lower sector of the F layer and exists from about 150 to 220 km (100 to 140 miles) above the surface of the Earth and only during daylight hours. It is composed of a mixture of molecular ions O2+ and NO+, and atomic ions O+. Above the F1 region, atomic oxygen becomes the dominant constituent because lighter particles tend to occupy higher altitudes above the turbopause (at ~90 km, 56 miles). This atomic oxygen provides the O+ atomic ions that make up the F2 layer.
The F1 layer has approximately 5 × 105 e/cm3 (free electrons per cubic centimeter) at noontime and minimum sunspot activity, and increases to roughly 2 × 106 e/cm3 during maximum sunspot activity. The density falls off to below 104 e/cm3 at night.
* The F1 layer merges into the F2 layer at night.
* Though fairly regular in its characteristics, it is not observable everywhere or on all days. The principal reflecting layer during the summer for paths of 2,000 to 3,500 km (1,200 to 2,200 miles) is the F1 layer. However, this depends upon the frequency of a propagating signal. The E layer electron density and resultant MUF, maximum usable frequency, during high solar activity periods can refract and thus block signals of up to about 15 MHz from reaching the F1 and F2 regions, with the result that distances are much shorter than possible with refractions from the F1 and F2 regions, but extremely low radiation-angle signals (lower than about 6 degrees) can reach distances of 3,000 km (1,900 miles) via E region refractions.
* The F2 layer exists from about 220 to 800 km (140 to 500 miles) above the surface of the Earth. The F2 layer is the principal reflecting layer for HF radio communications during both day and night. The horizon-limited distance for one-hop F2 propagation is usually around 4,000 km (2,500 miles). The F2 layer has about 106 e/cm3. However, variations are usually large, irregular, and particularly pronounced during magnetic storms. The F layer behaviour is dominated by the complex thermospheric winds.

==Usage in radio communication==
Critical F2 layer frequencies are the frequencies that will not go through the F2 layer. Under rare atmospheric conditions, F2 propagation can occur, resulting in VHF television and FM radio signals being received over great distances, well beyond the normal reception area.

<text>In telecommunications, the term frequency averaging has the following meanings: 
#The process by which the relative phases of precision clocks are compared for the purpose of defining a single time standard. 
#A process in which network synchronization is achieved by the use, at all nodes, of oscillators that adjust their frequencies to the average frequency of the digital bit streams received from connected nodes. 

In frequency averaging, all oscillators are assigned equal weights to determine the ultimate network frequency. 

In terms of musical note frequency, the averaging of the frequency of low or high notes in a solo instrumental piece is a technique used to match different instruments together so they may be played together. The musical note frequency calculation formula is used: F=(2^12/n)*440, where n equals the number of positive or negative steps away from the base note of A4(440 hertz), and F equals the frequency. The formula is used to calculate the frequency of each note in the piece. The values are then added together and divided by the number of notes. This is the average frequency of those notes. It is said that such techniques were used by classical composers, especially those who involved mathematics heavily in their music.

<text>Frequency deviation (formula_1) is used in FM radio to describe the difference between the minimum or maximum extent of a frequency modulated signal, and the nominal center or carrier frequency. The term is sometimes mistakenly used as synonymous with frequency drift, which is an unintended offset of an oscillator from its nominal frequency.

The frequency deviation of a radio is of particular importance in relation to bandwidth, because less deviation means that more channels can fit into the same amount of frequency spectrum. The FM broadcasting range between 87.5 and 108 MHz uses a typical channel spacing of 100 or 200 kHz, with a maximum frequency deviation of +/-75 kHz, in some cases leaving a buffer above the highest and below the lowest frequency to reduce interaction with other channels.

The most common FM transmitting applications use peak deviations of +/-75 kHz (100 or 200 kHz spacing), +/-5 kHz (15–25 kHz spacing), +/-2.5 kHz (3.75-12.5 kHz spacing), and +/-2 kHz (8.33 kHz spacing, 7.5 kHz spacing, 6.25 kHz spacing or 5 kHz spacing).

<doc id="41189" wikidata="Q5502872" url="?curid=41189" title="Frequency frogging">
<text>In telecommunications, the term frequency frogging has the following meanings: 

# The interchanging of the frequencies of carrier channels to accomplish specific purposes, such as to prevent feedback and oscillation, to reduce crosstalk, and to correct for a high frequency response slope in the transmission line. 
# In microwave radio relay systems, the alternate use of two frequencies at repeater sites to prevent feedback and oscillation. 

&quot;Note:&quot; Frequency frogging is accomplished by having modulators, which are integrated into specially designed repeaters, translate a low-frequency group to a high-frequency group, and vice versa. A frequency channel will appear in the low group for one repeater section and will then be translated to the high group for the next section because of frequency frogging. This results in nearly constant attenuation with frequency over two successive repeater sections, and eliminates the need for large slope equalization and adjustments. Singing and crosstalk are minimized because the high-level output of a repeater is at a different frequency than the low-level input to other repeaters. It also diminishes group delay distortion. A repeater that receives on the high band from both direction and sends on the low band is called Hi-Lo; the other kind Lo-Hi.

<text>In telecommunications, frequency sharing or channel sharing is the assignment to or use of the same radio frequency by two or more stations that are separated geographically or that use the frequency at different times. It reduces the potential for mutual interference where the assignment of different frequencies to each user is not practical or possible.

==Channel sharing in digital television==
U.S. mobile data usage in 2017 was 40 times that in 2010, forcing frequencies to be reallocated. The FCC&#x27;s 2016 auction allowed two or more stations to share a single 6 MHz television channel while retaining their licenses and all rights.

NBC sold the spectrum of three of its stations in the 2017 FCC auction: WNBC New York, Telemundo WSNS-TV Chicago and WWSI Philadelphia. Other NBC stations in the market would begin channel sharing with those stations; for instance, Comcast moved Channel 28 WNBC onto Telemundo&#x27;s Channel 35 WNJU, broadcasting both stations from WNJU&#x27;s antenna. Stations had to either channel-share with another TV station in this way or go off the air by Jan. 23, 2018.

<doc id="41193" wikidata="Q1166054" url="?curid=41193" title="Frequency-shift keying">
<text>Frequency-shift keying (FSK) is a frequency modulation scheme in which digital information is encoded on a carrier signal by periodically shifting the frequency of the carrier between several discrete frequencies. The technology is used for communication systems such as telemetry, weather balloon radiosondes, caller ID, garage door openers, and low frequency radio transmission in the VLF and ELF bands. The simplest FSK is [[Binary numeral system|binary]] FSK (BFSK, which is also commonly referred to as 2FSK or 2-FSK), in which the carrier is shifted between two discrete frequencies to transmit binary (0s and 1s) information.

==Modulating and demodulating==
Reference implementations of FSK modems exist and are documented in detail. The demodulation of a binary FSK signal can be done using the Goertzel algorithm very efficiently, even on low-power microcontrollers.

==Variations==

===Multiple frequency-shift keying===

===Continuous-phase frequency-shift keying===
In principle FSK can be implemented by using completely independent free-running oscillators, and switching between them at the beginning of each symbol period.
In general, independent oscillators will not be at the same phase and therefore the same amplitude at the switch-over instant,
causing sudden discontinuities in the transmitted signal.

In practice, many FSK transmitters use only a single oscillator, and the process of switching to a different frequency at the beginning of each symbol period preserves the phase.
The elimination of discontinuities in the phase (and therefore elimination of sudden changes in amplitude) reduces sideband power, reducing interference with neighboring channels.

===Gaussian frequency-shift keying===
Rather than directly modulating the frequency with the digital data symbols, &quot;instantaneously&quot; changing the frequency at the beginning of each symbol period, Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) filters the data pulses with a Gaussian filter to make the transitions smoother. This filter has the advantage of reducing sideband power, reducing interference with neighboring channels, at the cost of increasing intersymbol interference. It is used by Improved Layer 2 Protocol, DECT, Bluetooth, Cypress WirelessUSB, Nordic Semiconductor, Texas Instruments, IEEE 802.15.4, Z-Wave and Wavenis devices. For basic data rate Bluetooth the minimum deviation is 115 kHz.

A GFSK modulator differs from a simple frequency-shift keying modulator in that before the baseband waveform (with levels −1 and +1) goes into the FSK modulator, it passed through a Gaussian filter to make the transitions smoother to limit spectral width. Gaussian filtering is a standard way to reduce spectral width; it is called &quot;pulse shaping&quot; in this application.

In ordinary non-filtered FSK, at a jump from −1 to +1 or +1 to −1, the modulated waveform changes rapidly, which introduces large out-of-band spectrum. If the pulse is changed going from −1 to +1 as −1, −0.98, −0.93, ..., +0.93, +0.98, +1, and this smoother pulse is used to determine the carrier frequency, the out-of-band spectrum will be reduced.

===Minimum-shift keying===
Minimum frequency-shift keying or minimum-shift keying (MSK) is a particular spectrally efficient form of coherent FSK. In MSK, the difference between the higher and lower frequency is identical to half the bit rate. Consequently, the waveforms that represent a 0 and a 1 bit differ by exactly half a carrier period. The maximum frequency deviation is δ = 0.25 &quot;fm&quot;, where &quot;fm&quot; is the maximum modulating frequency. As a result, the modulation index &quot;m&quot; is 0.5. This is the smallest FSK modulation index that can be chosen such that the waveforms for 0 and 1 are orthogonal.

===Gaussian minimum-shift keying===
A variant of MSK called Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK) is used in the GSM mobile phone standard.

=== Audio frequency-shift keying ===
&quot;Audio frequency-shift keying&quot; (AFSK) is a modulation technique by which digital data is represented by changes in the frequency (pitch) of an audio tone, yielding an encoded signal suitable for transmission via radio or telephone. Normally, the transmitted audio alternates between two tones: one, the &quot;mark&quot;, represents a binary one; the other, the &quot;space&quot;, represents a binary zero.

AFSK differs from regular frequency-shift keying in performing the modulation at baseband frequencies. In radio applications, the AFSK-modulated signal normally is being used to modulate an RF carrier (using a conventional technique, such as AM or FM) for transmission.

AFSK is not always used for high-speed data communications, since it is far less efficient in both power and bandwidth than most other modulation modes. In addition to its simplicity, however, AFSK has the advantage that encoded signals will pass through AC-coupled links, including most equipment originally designed to carry music or speech.

AFSK is used in the U.S.-based Emergency Alert System to notify stations of the type of emergency, locations affected, and the time of issue without actually hearing the text of the alert.

===Multilevel frequency-shift keying===
Phase 1 radios in the Project 25 system use 4-level frequency-shift keying (4FSK).

==Applications==

In 1910, Reginald Fessenden invented a two-tone method of transmitting Morse code. Dots and dashes were replaced with different tones of equal length. The intent was to minimize transmission time.

Some early Continuous Wave (CW) transmitters employed an arc converter that could not be conveniently keyed. Instead of turning the arc on and off, the key slightly changed the transmitter frequency in a technique known as the &quot;compensation-wave method&quot;. The compensation-wave was not used at the receiver. Spark transmitters used for this method consumed a lot of bandwidth and caused interference, so it was discouraged by 1921.

Most early telephone-line modems used audio frequency-shift keying (AFSK) to send and receive data at rates up to about 1200 bits per second. The Bell 103 and Bell 202 modems used this technique. Even today, North American caller ID uses 1200 baud AFSK in the form of the Bell 202 standard. Some early microcomputers used a specific form of AFSK modulation, the Kansas City standard, to store data on audio cassettes. AFSK is still widely used in amateur radio, as it allows data transmission through unmodified voiceband equipment.

AFSK is also used in the United States&#x27; Emergency Alert System to transmit warning information. It is used at higher bitrates for Weathercopy used on Weatheradio by NOAA in the U.S.

The CHU shortwave radio station in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada broadcasts an exclusive digital time signal encoded using AFSK modulation.

==Caller ID and remote metering standards==
Frequency-shift keying (FSK) is commonly used over telephone lines for caller ID (displaying callers&#x27; numbers) and remote metering applications. There are several variations of this technology.

===European Telecommunications Standards Institute===
In some countries of Europe, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standards 200 778-1 and -2 – replacing 300 778-1 &amp; -2 – allow 3 physical transport layers (Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore), British Telecom (BT) and Cable Communications Association (CCA)), combined with 2 data formats Multiple Data Message Format (MDMF) &amp; Single Data Message Format (SDMF), plus the Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) system and a no-ring mode for meter-reading and the like. It&#x27;s more of a recognition that the different types exist than an attempt to define a single &quot;standard&quot;.

===Telcordia Technologies===
The Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore) standard is used in the United States, Canada (but see below), Australia, China, Hong Kong and Singapore. It sends the data after the first ring tone and uses the 1200 bits per second Bell 202 tone modulation. The data may be sent in SDMF – which includes the date, time and number – or in MDMF, which adds a NAME field.

===British Telecom===
British Telecom (BT) in the United Kingdom developed their own standard, which wakes up the display with a line reversal, then sends the data as CCITT v.23 modem tones in a format similar to MDMF. It is used by BT, wireless networks like the late Ionica, and some cable companies. Details are to be found in BT Supplier Information Notes (SINs) 227 (link broken 28/7/21) and 242 (link broken 28/7/21); another useful document is Designing Caller Identification Delivery Using XR-2211 for BT from the EXAR website.

===Cable Communications Association===
The Cable Communications Association (CCA) of the United Kingdom developed their own standard which sends the information after a short first ring, as either Bell 202 or V.23 tones. They developed a new standard rather than change some &quot;street boxes&quot; (multiplexors) which couldn&#x27;t cope with the BT standard. The UK cable industry use a variety of switches: most are Nortel DMS-100; some are System X; System Y; and Nokia DX220. Note that some of these use the BT standard instead of the CCA one. The data format is similar to the BT one, but the transport layer is more like Telcordia Technologies, so North American or European equipment is more likely to detect it.

<text>A frequency standard is a stable oscillator used for frequency calibration or reference. A frequency standard generates a fundamental frequency with a high degree of accuracy and precision. Harmonics of this fundamental frequency are used to provide reference points.

Since time is the reciprocal of frequency, it is relatively easy to derive a time standard from a frequency standard. A standard clock comprises a frequency standard, a device to count off the cycles of the oscillation emitted by the frequency standard, and a means of displaying or outputting the result.

Frequency standards in a network or facility are sometimes administratively designated as &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;secondary&quot;. The terms &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot;, as used in this context, should not be confused with the respective technical meanings of these words in the discipline of precise time and frequency.

==Frequency reference==
A frequency reference is an instrument used for providing a stable frequency of some kind. There are different sorts of frequency references, acoustic ones such as tuning forks but also electrical ones that emit a signal of a certain frequency (a frequency standard).

Among the most stable frequency references in the world are caesium standards (including caesium fountains) and hydrogen masers. Caesium standards are widely recognized as having better long-term stability, whereas hydrogen masers can attain superior short-term performance; therefore, several national standards laboratories use ensembles of caesium standards and hydrogen masers in order to combine the best attributes of both.

The carrier of time signal transmitters, Loran-C transmitters and of several long wave and medium wave broadcasting stations is derived from an atomic clock and can be therefore used as frequency standard.

<doc id="41196" wikidata="Q1455719" url="?curid=41196" title="Fresnel zone">
<text>A Fresnel zone ( ), named after physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel, is one of a series of confocal prolate ellipsoidal regions of space between and around a transmitter and a receiver. The primary wave will travel in a relative straight line from the transmitter to the receiver. Aberrant transmitted radio, sound, or light waves which are transmitted at the same time can follow slightly different paths before reaching a receiver, especially if there are obstructions or deflecting objects between the two. The two waves can arrive at the receiver at slightly different times and the aberrant wave may arrive out of phase with the primary wave due to the different path lengths. Depending on the magnitude of the phase difference between the two waves, the waves can interfere constructively or destructively. The size of the calculated Fresnel zone at any particular distance from the transmitter and receiver can help to predict whether obstructions or discontinuities along the path will cause significant interference.

==Significance==
In any wave-propagated transmission between a transmitter and receiver, some amount of the radiated wave propagates off-axis (not on the line-of-sight path between transmitter and receiver). This can then deflect off objects and then radiate to the receiver. However, the direct-path wave and the deflected-path wave may arrive out of phase, leading to destructive interference when the phase difference is half an odd integer (formula_1) multiple of the period. The n-th Fresnel zone is defined as the locus of points in 3D space such that a 2-segment path from the transmitter to the receiver that deflects off a point on that surface will be between n-1 and n half-wavelengths out of phase with the straight-line path. The boundaries of these zones will be ellipsoids with foci at the transmitter and receiver. In order to ensure limited interference, such transmission paths are designed with a certain clearance distance determined by a Fresnel-zone analysis. 

The dependence on the interference on clearance is the cause of the picket-fencing effect when either the radio transmitter or receiver is moving, and the high and low signal strength zones are above and below the receiver&#x27;s cut-off threshold. The extreme variations of signal strength at the receiver can cause interruptions in the communications link, or even prevent a signal from being received at all.

Fresnel zones are seen in optics, radio communications, electrodynamics, seismology, acoustics, gravitational radiation, and other situations involving the radiation of waves and multipath propagation. Fresnel zone computations are used to anticipate obstacle clearances required when designing highly directive systems such as microwave parabolic antenna systems. Although intuitively, clear line-of-sight between transmitter and receiver may seem to be all that is required for a strong antenna system, but because of the complex nature of radio waves, obstructions within the first Fresnel zone can cause significant weakness, even if those obstructions are not blocking the apparent line-of-sight signal path. For this reason, it is valuable to do a calculation of the size of the 1st, or primary, Fresnel zone for a given antenna system. Doing this will enable the antenna installer to decide if an obstacle, such as a tree, is going to make a significant impact on signal strength. The rule of thumb is that the primary Fresnel zone would ideally be 80% clear of obstacles, but must be at least 60% clear.

==Spatial structure==

Fresnel zones are confocal prolate ellipsoidal shaped regions in space (e.g. 1, 2, 3), centered around the line of the direct transmission path (path AB on the diagram). The first region includes the ellipsoidal space which the direct line-of-sight signal passes through. If a stray component of the transmitted signal bounces off an object within this region and then arrives at the receiving antenna, the phase shift will be something less than a quarter-length wave, or less than a 90º shift (path ACB on the diagram). The effect regarding phase-shift alone will be minimal. Therefore, this bounced signal can potentially result in having a positive impact on the receiver, as it is receiving a stronger signal than it would have without the deflection, and the additional signal will potentially be mostly in-phase. However, the positive attributes of this deflection also depends on the polarization of the signal relative to the object. 

The second region surrounds the first region but excludes it. If a reflective object is located in the second region, the stray sine-wave which has bounced from this object and has been captured by the receiver will be shifted more than 90º but less than 270º because of the increased path length, and will potentially be received out-of-phase. Generally this is unfavorable. But again, this depends on polarization. Use of same circular polarization (e.g. right) in both ends, will eliminate odd number of reflections (including one).

The third region surrounds the second region and deflected waves captured by the receiver will have the same effect as a wave in the first region. That is, the sine wave will have shifted more than 270º but less than 450º (ideally it would be a 360º shift) and will therefore arrive at the receiver with the same shift as a signal might arrive from the first region. A wave deflected from this region has the potential to be shifted precisely one wavelength so that it is exactly in sync with the line-of-sight wave when it arrives at the receiving antenna.

The fourth region surrounds the third region and is similar to the second region. And so on. 

If unobstructed and in a perfect environment, radio waves will travel in a relatively straight line from the transmitter to the receiver. But if there are reflective surfaces that interact with a stray transmitted wave, such as bodies of water, smooth terrain, roof tops, sides of buildings, etc., the radio waves deflecting off those surfaces may arrive either out-of-phase or in-phase with the signals that travel directly to the receiver. Sometimes this results in the counter-intuitive finding that reducing the height of an antenna increases the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. 

Although radio waves generally travel in a relative straight line, fog and even humidity can cause some of the signal in certain frequencies to scatter or bend before reaching the receiver. This means objects which are clear of the line of sight path will still potentially block parts of the signal. To maximize signal strength, one needs to minimize the effect of obstruction loss by removing obstacles from both the direct radio frequency line of sight (RF LoS) line and also the area around it within the primary Fresnel zone. The strongest signals are on the direct line between transmitter and receiver and always lie in the first Fresnel zone.

In the early 19th century, French scientist Augustin-Jean Fresnel created a method to calculate where the zones are — that is, whether a given obstacle will cause mostly in-phase or mostly out-of-phase deflections between the transmitter and the receiver.

==Clearance calculation==
The concept of Fresnel zone clearance may be used to analyze interference by obstacles near the path of a radio beam. The first zone must be kept largely free from obstructions to avoid interfering with the radio reception. However, some obstruction of the Fresnel zones can often be tolerated. As a rule of thumb the maximum obstruction allowable is 40%, but the recommended obstruction is 20% or less.

For establishing Fresnel zones, first determine the RF line of sight (RF LoS), which in simple terms is a straight line between the transmitting and receiving antennas. Now the zone surrounding the RF LoS is said to be the Fresnel zone.
The cross sectional radius of each Fresnel zone is the longest at the midpoint of the RF LoS, shrinking to a point at each vertex, behind the antennas.

===Formulation===
Consider an arbitrary point &quot;P&quot; in the LoS, at a distance formula_2 and formula_3 with respect to each of the two antennas.
To obtain the radius formula_4 of zone formula_5, note that the volume of the zone is delimited by all points for which the difference in distances, between the reflected wave (formula_6) and the direct wave (formula_7) is the constant formula_8 (multiples of half a wavelength). This effectively defines an ellipsoid with the major axis along formula_9 and foci at the antennas (points A and B). So:

:formula_10

Re-writing the expression with the coordinates of point formula_11 and the distance between antennas formula_12, it gives:

:formula_13
:formula_14

Assuming the distances between the antennas and the point formula_11 are much larger than the radius and applying the binomial approximation for the square root, formula_16 (for &quot;x&quot;≪1), the expression simplifies to:

:formula_17

which can be solved for formula_4:

:formula_19

For a satellite-to-Earth link, it further simplifies to:

:formula_20
Note that when formula_21 or formula_22, which implies that the foci seem to coincide with the vertices of the ellipsoid. This is not correct and it&#x27;s a consequence of the approximation made. 

Setting the point formula_11 to one of the vertices (behind an antenna), it&#x27;s possible to obtain the error formula_24 of this approximation:

:formula_25

Since the distance between antennas is generally tens of km and formula_26 of the order of cm, the error is negligible for a graphical representation.

On the other hand, considering the clearance at the left-hand antenna, with formula_27, and applying the binomial approximation only at the right-hand antenna, we find:
:formula_28
:formula_29
The quadratic polynomial roots are:
:formula_30
Applying the binomial approximation one last time, we finally find:
:formula_31
So, there should be at least half a wavelength of clearance at the antenna in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight.
The vertical clearance at the antenna in a slant direction inclined at an altitude angle &quot;a&quot; would be:
:formula_32

===Maximum clearance===
For practical applications, it is often useful to know the maximum radius of the first Fresnel zone. Using formula_33, formula_34, and formula_35 in the above formula gives

:formula_36
where
:formula_12 is the distance between the two antennas,
:formula_38 is the frequency of the transmitted signal,
:formula_39 ≈ is the speed of light in the air.

Substitution of the numeric value for formula_39 followed by a unit conversion results in an easy way to calculate the radius of the first Fresnel zone formula_41, knowing the distance between the two antennas formula_12 and the frequency of the transmitted signal formula_38:

<text>In telecommunication, the term front-to-back ratio (&quot;also known as front-to-rear ratio&quot;) can mean:
#The ratio of power gain between the front and rear of a directional antenna. 
#Ratio of signal strength transmitted in a forward direction to that transmitted in a backward direction. For receiving antennas, the ratio of received-signal strength when the antenna is rotated 180°.

The ratio compares the antenna gain in a specified direction, &quot;i.e.&quot;, azimuth, usually that of maximum gain, to the gain in a direction 180° from the specified azimuth. A front-to-back ratio is usually expressed in decibels (dB). 

In point-to-point microwave antennas, a &quot;high performance&quot; antenna usually has a higher front to back ratio than other antennas. For example, an unshrouded 38 GHz microwave dish may have a front to back ratio of 64 dB, while the same size reflector equipped with a shroud would have a front to back ratio of 70 dB. Other factors affecting the front to back ratio of a parabolic microwave antenna include the material of the dish and the precision with which the reflector itself was formed.

In other electrical engineering the front to back ratio is a ratio of parameters used to characterize rectifiers or other devices, in which electric current, signal strength, resistance, or other parameters, in one direction is compared with that in the opposite direction.

<doc id="41200" wikidata="Q1065170" url="?curid=41200" title="Full width at half maximum">
<text>In a distribution, full width at half maximum (FWHM) is the difference between the two values of the independent variable at which the dependent variable is equal to half of its maximum value. In other words, it is the width of a spectrum curve measured between those points on the &quot;y&quot;-axis which are half the maximum amplitude.
Half width at half maximum (HWHM) is half of the FWHM if the function is symmetric.
The term full duration at half maximum (FDHM) is preferred when the independent variable is time.

FWHM is applied to such phenomena as the duration of pulse waveforms and the spectral width of sources used for optical communications and the resolution of spectrometers.
The convention of &quot;width&quot; meaning &quot;half maximum&quot; is also widely used in signal processing to define bandwidth as &quot;width of frequency range where less than half the signal&#x27;s power is attenuated&quot;, i.e., the power is at least half the maximum. In signal processing terms, this is at most −3 dB of attenuation, called &quot;half-power point&quot; or, more specifically, &quot;half-power bandwidth&quot;.
When half-power point is applied to antenna beam width, it is called &quot;half-power beam width&quot;.

==Specific distributions==

===Normal distribution===
If the considered function is the density of a normal distribution of the form
formula_1
where &quot;σ&quot; is the standard deviation and &quot;x&quot;0 is the expected value, then the relationship between FWHM and the standard deviation is
formula_2
The FWHM does not depend on the expected value &quot;x&quot;0; it is invariant under translations.
The area within this FWHM is approximately 76% of the total area under the function.

===Other distributions===
In spectroscopy half the width at half maximum (here &quot;γ&quot;), HWHM, is in common use. For example, a Lorentzian/Cauchy distribution of height can be defined by
formula_3

Another important distribution function, related to solitons in optics, is the hyperbolic secant:
formula_4
Any translating element was omitted, since it does not affect the FWHM. For this impulse we have:
formula_5
where is the inverse hyperbolic secant.

<doc id="41206" wikidata="Q944873" url="?curid=41206" title="Gaussian beam">
<text>In optics, a Gaussian beam is an idealized beam of electromagnetic radiation whose amplitude envelope in the transverse plane is given by a Gaussian function; this also implies a Gaussian intensity (irradiance) profile. This fundamental (or TEM00) transverse Gaussian mode describes the intended output of many lasers, as such a beam diverges less and can be focused better than any other. When a Gaussian beam is refocused by an ideal lens, a new Gaussian beam is produced. The electric and magnetic field amplitude profiles along a circular Gaussian beam of a given wavelength and polarization are determined by two parameters: the waist , which is a measure of the width of the beam at its narrowest point, and the position relative to the waist.

Since the Gaussian function is infinite in extent, perfect Gaussian beams do not exist in nature, and the edges of any such beam would be cut off by any finite lens or mirror. However, the Gaussian is a useful approximation to a real-world beam for cases where lenses or mirrors in the beam are significantly larger than the spot size &quot;w&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) of the beam.

Fundamentally, the Gaussian is a solution of the paraxial Helmholtz equation, the wave equation for an electromagnetic field. Although there exist other solutions, the Gaussian families of solutions are useful for problems involving compact beams.

==Mathematical form==

The equations below assume a beam with a circular cross-section at all values of ; this can be seen by noting that a single transverse dimension, , appears. Beams with elliptical cross-sections, or with waists at different positions in for the two transverse dimensions (astigmatic beams) can also be described as Gaussian beams, but with distinct values of and of the location for the two transverse dimensions and .
The Gaussian beam is a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode. The mathematical expression for the electric field amplitude is a solution to the paraxial Helmholtz equation. Assuming polarization in the direction and propagation in the direction, the electric field in phasor (complex) notation is given by:

formula_1

where

* is the radial distance from the center axis of the beam,
* is the axial distance from the beam&#x27;s focus (or &quot;waist&quot;),
* is the imaginary unit,
* is the wave number (in radians per meter) for a free-space wavelength , and is the index of refraction of the medium in which the beam propagates,
*, the electric field amplitude at the origin (, ),
* is the radius at which the field amplitudes fall to of their axial values (i.e., where the intensity values fall to of their axial values), at the plane along the beam,
* is the waist radius,
* is the radius of curvature of the beam&#x27;s wavefronts at , and
* is the Gouy phase at , an extra phase term beyond that attributable to the phase velocity of light.

The physical electric field is obtained from the phasor field amplitude given above by taking the real part of the amplitude times a time factor:
formula_2
where formula_3 is the angular frequency of the light and is time. The time factor involves an arbitrary sign convention, as discussed at .

Since this solution relies on the paraxial approximation, it is not accurate for very strongly diverging beams. The above form is valid in most practical cases, where .

The corresponding intensity (or irradiance) distribution is given by

formula_4

where the constant is the wave impedance of the medium in which the beam is propagating. For free space, ≈ 377 Ω. is the intensity at the center of the beam at its waist.

If is the total power of the beam,
formula_5

===Evolving beam width===

At a position along the beam (measured from the focus), the spot size parameter is given by a hyperbolic relation:
formula_6
where
formula_7
is called the Rayleigh range as further discussed below, and formula_8 is the refractive index of the medium.

The radius of the beam , at any position along the beam, is related to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the intensity distribution at that position according to:
formula_9

===Wavefront curvature===
The radius of the wavefront&#x27;s curvature is largest on either side of the waist, crossing zero curvature (radius = ∞) at the waist itself. The rate of change of the wavefront&#x27;s curvature is largest at the Rayleigh distance, . Beyond the Rayleigh distance, , it again decreases in magnitude, approaching zero as . The curvature is often expressed in terms of its reciprocal, , the &quot;radius of curvature&quot;; for a fundamental Gaussian beam the curvature at position is given by:

formula_10

so the radius of curvature is 
formula_11
Being the reciprocal of the curvature, the radius of curvature reverses sign and is infinite at the beam waist where the curvature goes through zero.

===Elliptical and astigmatic beams===
Many laser beams have an elliptical cross-section. Also common are beams with waist positions which are different for the two transverse dimensions, called astigmatic beams. These beams can be dealt with using the above two evolution equations, but with distinct values of each parameter for and and distinct definitions of the point. The Gouy phase is a single value calculated correctly by summing the contribution from each dimension, with a Gouy phase within the range contributed by each dimension.

An elliptical beam will invert its ellipticity ratio as it propagates from the far field to the waist. The dimension which was the larger far from the waist, will be the smaller near the waist.

===Gaussian as a decomposition into modes===

Arbitrary solutions of the paraxial Helmholtz equation can be decomposed as the sum of Hermite–Gaussian modes (whose amplitude profiles are separable in and using Cartesian coordinates), Laguerre–Gaussian modes (whose amplitude profiles are separable in and using cylindrical coordinates) or similarly as combinations of Ince–Gaussian modes (whose amplitude profiles are separable in and using elliptical coordinates). At any point along the beam these modes include the same Gaussian factor as the fundamental Gaussian mode multiplying the additional geometrical factors for the specified mode. However different modes propagate with a different Gouy phase which is why the net transverse profile due to a superposition of modes evolves in , whereas the propagation of any &quot;single&quot; Hermite–Gaussian (or Laguerre–Gaussian) mode retains the same form along a beam.

Although there are other modal decompositions, Gaussians are useful for problems involving compact beams, that is, where the optical power is rather closely confined along an axis. Even when a laser is &quot;not&quot; operating in the fundamental Gaussian mode, its power will generally be found among the lowest-order modes using these decompositions, as the spatial extent of higher order modes will tend to exceed the bounds of a laser&#x27;s resonator (cavity). &quot;Gaussian beam&quot; normally implies radiation confined to the fundamental (TEM00) Gaussian mode.

== Beam parameters ==

The geometric dependence of the fields of a Gaussian beam are governed by the light&#x27;s wavelength (&quot;in&quot; the dielectric medium, if not free space) and the following beam parameters, all of which are connected as detailed in the following sections.

===Beam waist===

The shape of a Gaussian beam of a given wavelength is governed solely by one parameter, the &quot;beam waist&quot; . This is a measure of the beam size at the point of its focus ( in the above equations) where the beam width (as defined above) is the smallest (and likewise where the intensity on-axis () is the largest). From this parameter the other parameters describing the beam geometry are determined. This includes the Rayleigh range and asymptotic beam divergence , as detailed below.

===Rayleigh range and confocal parameter===

The &quot;Rayleigh distance&quot; or &quot;Rayleigh range&quot; is determined given a Gaussian beam&#x27;s waist size:

formula_12

Here is the wavelength of the light, is the index of refraction. At a distance from the waist equal to the Rayleigh range , the width of the beam is larger than it is at the focus where , the beam waist. That also implies that the on-axis () intensity there is one half of the peak intensity (at ). That point along the beam also happens to be where the wavefront curvature () is greatest.

The distance between the two points is called the &quot;confocal parameter&quot; or &quot;depth of focus&quot; of the beam.

===Beam divergence===

Although the tails of a Gaussian function never actually reach zero, for the purposes of the following discussion the &quot;edge&quot; of a beam is considered to be the radius where . That is where the intensity has dropped to of its on-axis value. Now, for the parameter increases linearly with . This means that far from the waist, the beam &quot;edge&quot; (in the above sense) is cone-shaped. The angle between that cone (whose ) and the beam axis () defines the &quot;divergence&quot; of the beam:
formula_13

In the paraxial case, as we have been considering, (in radians) is then approximately
formula_14

where is the refractive index of the medium the beam propagates through, and is the free-space wavelength. The total angular spread of the diverging beam, or &quot;apex angle&quot; of the above-described cone, is then given by
formula_15

That cone then contains 86% of the Gaussian beam&#x27;s total power.

Because the divergence is inversely proportional to the spot size, for a given wavelength , a Gaussian beam that is focused to a small spot diverges rapidly as it propagates away from the focus. Conversely, to &quot;minimize&quot; the divergence of a laser beam in the far field (and increase its peak intensity at large distances) it must have a large cross-section () at the waist (and thus a large diameter where it is launched, since is never less than ). This relationship between beam width and divergence is a fundamental characteristic of diffraction, and of the Fourier transform which describes Fraunhofer diffraction. A beam with any specified amplitude profile also obeys this inverse relationship, but the fundamental Gaussian mode is a special case where the product of beam size at focus and far-field divergence is smaller than for any other case.

Since the Gaussian beam model uses the paraxial approximation, it fails when wavefronts are tilted by more than about 30° from the axis of the beam. From the above expression for divergence, this means the Gaussian beam model is only accurate for beams with waists larger than about .

Laser beam quality is quantified by the beam parameter product (BPP). For a Gaussian beam, the BPP is the product of the beam&#x27;s divergence and waist size . The BPP of a real beam is obtained by measuring the beam&#x27;s minimum diameter and far-field divergence, and taking their product. The ratio of the BPP of the real beam to that of an ideal Gaussian beam at the same wavelength is known as (&quot;M squared&quot;). The for a Gaussian beam is one. All real laser beams have values greater than one, although very high quality beams can have values very close to one.

The numerical aperture of a Gaussian beam is defined to be , where is the index of refraction of the medium through which the beam propagates. This means that the Rayleigh range is related to the numerical aperture by 
formula_16

===Gouy phase===
The &quot;Gouy phase&quot; is a phase shift gradually acquired by a beam around the focal region. At position the Gouy phase of a fundamental Gaussian beam is given by
formula_17
The Gouy phase results in an increase in the apparent wavelength near the waist (). Thus the phase velocity in that region formally exceeds the speed of light. That paradoxical behavior must be understood as a near-field phenomenon where the departure from the phase velocity of light (as would apply exactly to a plane wave) is very small except in the case of a beam with large numerical aperture, in which case the wavefronts&#x27; curvature (see previous section) changes substantially over the distance of a single wavelength. In all cases the wave equation is satisfied at every position.

The sign of the Gouy phase depends on the sign convention chosen for the electric field phasor. With dependence, the Gouy phase changes from to , while with dependence it changes from to along the axis.

For a fundamental Gaussian beam, the Gouy phase results in a net phase discrepancy with respect to the speed of light amounting to radians (thus a phase reversal) as one moves from the far field on one side of the waist to the far field on the other side. This phase variation is not observable in most experiments. It is, however, of theoretical importance and takes on a greater range for higher-order Gaussian modes.

==Power and intensity==

=== Power through an aperture ===
With a beam centered on an aperture, the power passing through a circle of radius in the transverse plane at position is
formula_18
where
formula_19
is the total power transmitted by the beam.

For a circle of radius , the fraction of power transmitted through the circle is
formula_20

Similarly, about 90% of the beam&#x27;s power will flow through a circle of radius , 95% through a circle of radius , and 99% through a circle of radius .

=== Peak intensity ===
The peak intensity at an axial distance from the beam waist can be calculated as the limit of the enclosed power within a circle of radius , divided by the area of the circle as the circle shrinks:
formula_21

The limit can be evaluated using L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule:
formula_22

==Complex beam parameter==

The spot size and curvature of a Gaussian beam as a function of along the beam can also be encoded in the complex beam parameter given by:
formula_23

The reciprocal of contains the wavefront curvature and relative on-axis intensity in its real and imaginary parts, respectively:

formula_24

The complex beam parameter simplifies the mathematical analysis of Gaussian beam propagation, and especially in the analysis of optical resonator cavities using ray transfer matrices.

Then using this form, the earlier equation for the electric (or magnetic) field is greatly simplified. If we call the relative field strength of an elliptical Gaussian beam (with the elliptical axes in the and directions) then it can be separated in and according to:
formula_25

where 
formula_26

where and are the complex beam parameters in the and directions.

For the common case of a circular beam profile, and , which yields
formula_27

==Beam optics==
When a gaussian beam propagates through a thin lens, the outgoing beam is also a (different) gaussian beam, provided that the beam travels along the cylindrical symmetry axis of the lens, and that the lens is larger than the width of the beam. The focal length of the lens formula_28, the beam waist radius formula_29, and beam waist position formula_30 of the incoming beam can be used to determine the beam waist radius formula_31 and position formula_32 of the outgoing beam.

===Lens equation===
As derived by Saleh and Teich, the relationship between the ingoing and outgoing beams can be found by considering the phase that is added to each point formula_33 of the gaussian beam as it travels through the lens. An alternative approach due to Self is to consider the effect of a thin lens on the gaussian beam wavefronts.

The exact solution to the above problem is expressed simply in terms of the magnification formula_34

:formula_35

The magnification, which depends on formula_29 and formula_30, is given by

:formula_38

where

:formula_39

An equivalent expression for the beam position formula_32 is

:formula_41

This last expression makes clear that the ray optics thin lens equation is recovered in the limit that formula_42. It can also be noted that if formula_43 then the incoming beam is &quot;well collimated&quot; so that formula_44.

===Beam focusing===
In some applications it is desirable to use a converging lens to focus a laser beam to a very small spot. Mathematically, this implies minimization of the magnification formula_34. If the beam size is constrained by the size of available optics, this is typically best achieved by sending the largest possible collimated beam through a small focal length lens, i.e. by maximizing formula_46 and minimizing formula_28. In this situation, it is justifiable to make the approximation formula_48, implying that formula_49 and yielding the result formula_50. This result is often presented in the form

:formula_51

where
:formula_52

which is found after assuming that the medium has index of refraction formula_53 and substituting formula_54. The factors of 2 are introduced because of a common preference to represent beam size by the beam waist diameters formula_55 and formula_56, rather than the waist radii formula_31 and formula_29.

==Wave equation==
As a special case of electromagnetic radiation, Gaussian beams (and the higher-order Gaussian modes detailed below) are solutions to the wave equation for an electromagnetic field in free space or in a homogeneous dielectric medium, obtained by combining Maxwell&#x27;s equations for the curl of and the curl of , resulting in: 
formula_59
where is the speed of light &quot;in the medium&quot;, and could either refer to the electric or magnetic field vector, as any specific solution for either determines the other. The Gaussian beam solution is valid only in the paraxial approximation, that is, where wave propagation is limited to directions within a small angle of an axis. Without loss of generality let us take that direction to be the direction in which case the solution can generally be written in terms of which has no time dependence and varies relatively smoothly in space, with the main variation spatially corresponding to the wavenumber in the direction:
formula_60

Using this form along with the paraxial approximation, can then be essentially neglected. Since solutions of the electromagnetic wave equation only hold for polarizations which are orthogonal to the direction of propagation (), we have without loss of generality considered the polarization to be in the direction so that we now solve a scalar equation for .

Substituting this solution into the wave equation above yields the paraxial approximation to the scalar wave equation:
formula_61
Writing the wave equations in the light-cone coordinates returns this equation without utilizing any approximation. Gaussian beams of any beam waist satisfy the paraxial approximation to the scalar wave equation; this is most easily verified by expressing the wave at in terms of the complex beam parameter as defined above. There are many other solutions. As solutions to a linear system, any combination of solutions (using addition or multiplication by a constant) is also a solution. The fundamental Gaussian happens to be the one that minimizes the product of minimum spot size and far-field divergence, as noted above. In seeking paraxial solutions, and in particular ones that would describe laser radiation that is &quot;not&quot; in the fundamental Gaussian mode, we will look for families of solutions with gradually increasing products of their divergences and minimum spot sizes. Two important orthogonal decompositions of this sort are the Hermite–Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian modes, corresponding to rectangular and circular symmetry respectively, as detailed in the next section. With both of these, the fundamental Gaussian beam we have been considering is the lowest order mode.

==Higher-order modes==
=== Hermite-Gaussian modes ===
It is possible to decompose a coherent paraxial beam using the orthogonal set of so-called &quot;Hermite-Gaussian modes&quot;, any of which are given by the product of a factor in and a factor in . Such a solution is possible due to the separability in and in the paraxial Helmholtz equation as written in Cartesian coordinates. Thus given a mode of order referring to the and directions, the electric field amplitude at may be given by:
formula_62 
where the factors for the and dependence are each given by:
formula_63

where are the generalized Laguerre polynomials. is a required normalization constant:
formula_64.

 and have the same definitions as above. As with the higher-order Hermite-Gaussian modes the magnitude of the Laguerre-Gaussian modes&#x27; Gouy phase shift is exaggerated by the factor :
formula_65
where in this case the combined mode number . As before, the transverse amplitude variations are contained in the last two factors on the upper line of the equation, which again includes the basic Gaussian drop off in but now multiplied by a Laguerre polynomial. The effect of the rotational mode number , in addition to affecting the Laguerre polynomial, is mainly contained in the &quot;phase&quot; factor , in which the beam profile is advanced (or retarded) by complete phases in one rotation around the beam (in ). This is an example of an optical vortex of topological charge , and can be associated with the orbital angular momentum of light in that mode.

=== Ince-Gaussian modes ===

In elliptic coordinates, one can write the higher-order modes using Ince polynomials. The even and odd Ince-Gaussian modes are given by

formula_66
where and are the radial and angular elliptic coordinates defined by
formula_67
 are the even Ince polynomials of order and degree where is the ellipticity parameter. The Hermite-Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes are a special case of the Ince-Gaussian modes for and respectively.

=== Hypergeometric-Gaussian modes ===

There is another important class of paraxial wave modes in cylindrical coordinates in which the complex amplitude is proportional to a confluent hypergeometric function.

These modes have a singular phase profile and are eigenfunctions of the photon orbital angular momentum. Their intensity profiles are characterized by a single brilliant ring; like Laguerre–Gaussian modes, their intensities fall to zero at the center (on the optical axis) except for the fundamental (0,0) mode. A mode&#x27;s complex amplitude can be written in terms of the normalized (dimensionless) radial coordinate and the normalized longitudinal coordinate as follows:

formula_68

<text>A gel is a semi-solid that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute cross-linked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady state, although the liquid phase may still diffuse through this system.

Gels are mostly liquid by mass, yet they behave like solids because of a three-dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid. It is the cross-linking within the fluid that gives a gel its structure (hardness) and contributes to the adhesive stick (tack). In this way, gels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid medium. The word &quot;gel&quot; was coined by 19th-century Scottish chemist Thomas Graham by clipping from &quot;gelatine&quot;.

The process of forming a gel is called gelation.

==Composition==
Gels consist of a solid three-dimensional network that spans the volume of a liquid medium and ensnares it through surface tension effects. This internal network structure may result from physical bonds such as polymer chain entanglements (see polymers) (physical gels) or chemical bonds such as disulfide bonds (see thiomers) (chemical gels), as well as crystallites or other junctions that remain intact within the extending fluid. Virtually any fluid can be used as an extender including water (hydrogels), oil, and air (aerogel). Both by weight and volume, gels are mostly fluid in composition and thus exhibit densities similar to those of their constituent liquids. Edible jelly is a common example of a hydrogel and has approximately the density of water.

===Polyionic polymers===
Polyionic polymers are polymers with an ionic functional group. The ionic charges prevent the formation of tightly coiled polymer chains. This allows them to contribute more to viscosity in their stretched state, because the stretched-out polymer takes up more space. This is also the reason gel hardens. See polyelectrolyte for more information.

==Types==

===Colloidal gels===

A colloidal gel consists of a percolated network of particles in a fluid medium, providing mechanical properties, in particular the emergence of elastic behaviour. The particles can show attractive interactions through osmotic depletion or through polymeric links.

Colloidal gels have three phases in their lifespan: gelation, aging and collapse. The gel is initially formed by the assembly of particles into a space-spanning network, leading to a phase arrest. In the aging phase, the particles slowly rearrange to form thicker strands, increasing the elasticity of the material. Gels can also be collapsed and separated by external fields such as gravity. Colloidal gels show linear response rheology at low amplitudes. These materials have been explored as candidates for a drug release matrix.

===Hydrogels===


A hydrogel is a network of polymer chains that are hydrophilic, sometimes found as a colloidal gel in which water is the dispersion medium. A three-dimensional solid results from the hydrophilic polymer chains being held together by cross-links. Because of the inherent cross-links, the structural integrity of the hydrogel network does not dissolve from the high concentration of water. Hydrogels are highly absorbent (they can contain over 90% water) natural or synthetic polymeric networks.
Hydrogels also possess a degree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue, due to their significant water content. As responsive &quot;smart materials,&quot; hydrogels can encapsulate chemical systems which upon stimulation by external factors such as a change of pH may cause specific compounds such as glucose to be liberated to the environment, in most cases by a gel-sol transition to the liquid state. Chemomechanical polymers are mostly also hydrogels, which upon stimulation change their volume and can serve as actuators or sensors. The first appearance of the term &#x27;hydrogel&#x27; in the literature was in 1894.

===Organogels===
An organogel is a non-crystalline, non-glassy thermoreversible (thermoplastic) solid material composed of a liquid organic phase entrapped in a three-dimensionally cross-linked network. The liquid can be, for example, an organic solvent, mineral oil, or vegetable oil. The solubility and dimensions of the structurant are important characteristics for the elastic properties and firmness of the organogel. Often, these systems are based on self-assembly of the structurant molecules. (An example of formation of an undesired thermoreversible network is the occurrence of wax crystallization in petroleum.)

Organogels have potential for use in a number of applications, such as in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, art conservation, and food.

===Xerogels===

A xerogel is a solid formed from a gel by drying with unhindered shrinkage. Xerogels usually retain high porosity (15–50%) and enormous surface area (150–900 m2/g), along with very small pore size (1–10 nm). When solvent removal occurs under supercritical conditions, the network does not shrink and a highly porous, low-density material known as an &quot;aerogel&quot; is produced. Heat treatment of a xerogel at elevated temperature produces viscous sintering (shrinkage of the xerogel due to a small amount of viscous flow) which results in a denser and more robust solid, the density and porosity achieved depend on the sintering conditions.

=== Nanocomposite hydrogels ===
Nanocomposite hydrogels or hybrid hydrogels, are highly hydrated polymeric networks, either physically or covalently crosslinked with each other and/or with nanoparticles or nanostructures. Nanocomposite hydrogels can mimic native tissue properties, structure and microenvironment due to their hydrated and interconnected porous structure. A wide range of nanoparticles, such as carbon-based, polymeric, ceramic, and metallic nanomaterials can be incorporated within the hydrogel structure to obtain nanocomposites with tailored functionality. Nanocomposite hydrogels can be engineered to possess superior physical, chemical, electrical, thermal, and biological properties.

==Properties==
Many gels display thixotropy – they become fluid when agitated, but resolidify when resting.
In general, gels are apparently solid, jelly-like materials. It is a type of non-Newtonian fluid.
By replacing the liquid with gas it is possible to prepare aerogels, materials with exceptional properties including very low density, high specific surface areas, and excellent thermal insulation properties.

=== Thermodynamics of gel deformation ===
A gel is in essence the mixture of a polymer network and a solvent phase. Upon stretching, the network crosslinks are moved further apart from each other. Due to the polymer strands between crosslinks acting as entropic springs, gels demonstrate elasticity like rubber (which is just a polymer network, without solvent). This is so because the free energy penalty to stretch an ideal polymer segment formula_1 monomers of size formula_2 between crosslinks to an end-to-end distance formula_3 is approximately given by

: formula_4

This is the origin of both gel and rubber elasticity. But one key difference is that gel contains an additional solvent phase and hence is capable of having significant volume changes under deformation by taking in and out solvent. For example, a gel could swell to several times its initial volume after being immersed in a solvent after equilibrium is reached. This is the phenomenon of gel swelling. On the contrary, if we take the swollen gel out and allow the solvent to evaporate, the gel would shrink to roughly its original size. This gel volume change can alternatively be introduced by applying external forces. If a uniaxial compressive stress is applied to a gel, some solvent contained in the gel would be squeezed out and the gel shrinks in the applied-stress direction.

To study the gel mechanical state in equilibrium, a good starting point is to consider a cubic gel of volume formula_5 that is stretched by factors formula_6, formula_7 and formula_8 in the three orthogonal directions during swelling after being immersed in a solvent phase of initial volume formula_9. The final deformed volume of gel is then formula_10 and the total volume of the system is formula_11, that is assumed constant during the swelling process for simplicity of treatment. The swollen state of the gel is now completely characterized by stretch factors formula_6, formula_7 and formula_8 and hence it is of interest to derive the deformation free energy as a function of them, denoted as formula_15. For analogy to the historical treatment of rubber elasticity and mixing free energy, formula_15 is most often defined as the free energy difference after and before the swelling normalized by the initial gel volume formula_5, that is, a free energy difference density. The form of formula_15 naturally assumes two contributions of radically different physical origins, one associated with the elastic deformation of the polymer network, and the other with the mixing of the network with the solvent. Hence, we write

: formula_19

We now consider the two contributions separately. The polymer elastic deformation term is independent of the solvent phase and has the same expression as a rubber, as derived in the Kuhn&#x27;s theory of rubber elasticity:

: formula_20

where formula_21 denotes the shear modulus of the initial state. On the other hand, the mixing term formula_22 is usually treated by the Flory-Huggins free energy of concentrated polymer solutions formula_23, where formula_24 is polymer volume fraction. Suppose the initial gel has a polymer volume fraction of formula_25, the polymer volume fraction after swelling would be formula_26 since the number of monomers remains the same while the gel volume has increased by a factor of formula_27. As the polymer volume fraction decreases from formula_25 to formula_24, a polymer solution of concentration formula_25 and volume formula_5 is mixed with a pure solvent of volume formula_32 to become a solution with polymer concentration formula_24 and volume formula_10. The free energy density change in this mixing step is given as

: formula_35

where on the right-hand side, the first term is the Flory–Huggins energy density of the final swollen gel, the second is associated with the initial gel and the third is of the pure solvent prior to mixing. Substitution of formula_36 leads to

: formula_37

Note that the second term is independent of the stretching factors formula_6, formula_7 and formula_8 and hence can be dropped in subsequent analysis. Now we make use of the Flory-Huggins free energy for a polymer-solvent solution that reads

: formula_41

where formula_42 is monomer volume, formula_1 is polymer strand length and formula_44 is the Flory-Huggins energy parameter. Because in a network, the polymer length is effectively infinite, we can take the limit formula_45 and formula_23 reduces to

: formula_47

Substitution of this expression into formula_22 and addition of the network contribution leads to

: formula_49

This provides the starting point to examining the swelling equilibrium of a gel network immersed in solvent. It can be shown that gel swelling is the competition between two forces, one is the osmotic pressure of the polymer solution that favors the take in of solvent and expansion, the other is the restoring force of the polymer network elasticity that favors shrinkage. At equilibrium, the two effects exactly cancel each other in principle and the associated formula_6, formula_7 and formula_8 define the equilibrium gel volume. In solving the force balance equation, graphical solutions are often preferred.

In an alternative, scaling approach, suppose an isotropic gel is stretch by a factor of formula_53 in all three directions. Under the affine network approximation, the mean-square end-to-end distance in the gel increases from initial formula_54 to formula_55 and the elastic energy of one stand can be written as

: formula_56

where formula_57 is the mean-square fluctuation in end-to-end distance of one strand. The modulus of the gel is then this single-strand elastic energy multiplied by strand number density formula_58 to give

: formula_59

This modulus can then be equated to osmotic pressure (through differentiation of the free energy) to give the same equation as we found above.

=== Modified Donnan equilibrium of polyelectrolyte gels ===
Consider a hydrogel made of polyelectrolytes decorated with weak acid groups that can ionize according to the reaction

: formula_60

is immersed in a salt solution of physiological concentration. The degree of ionization of the polyelectrolytes is then controlled by the formula_61 and due to the charged nature of formula_62 and formula_63, electrostatic interactions with other ions in the systems. This is effectively a reacting system governed by acid-base equilibrium modulated by electrostatic effects, and is relevant in drug delivery, sea water desalination and dialysis technologies. Due to the elastic nature of the gel, the dispersion of formula_63 in the system is constrained and hence, there will be a partitioning of salts ions and formula_62 inside and outside the gel, which is intimately coupled to the polyelectrolyte degree of ionization. This ion partitioning inside and outside the gel is analogous to the partitioning of ions across a semipemerable membrane in classical Donnan theory, but a membrane is not needed here because the gel volume constraint imposed by network elasticity effectively acts its role, in preventing the macroions to pass through the fictitious membrane while allowing ions to pass.

The coupling between the ion partitioning and polyelectrolyte ionization degree is only partially by the classical Donnan theory. As a starting point we can neglect the electrostatic interactions among ions. Then at equilibrium, some of the weak acid sites in the gel would dissociate to form formula_63that electrostatically attracts positive charged formula_62 and salt cations leading to a relatively high concentration of formula_62 and salt cations inside the gel. But because the concentration of formula_62 is locally higher, it suppresses the further ionization of the acid sites. This phenomenon is the prediction of the classical Donnan theory. However, with electrostatic interactions, there are further complications to the picture. Consider the case of two adjacent, initially uncharged acid sites formula_70 are both dissociated to form formula_63. Since the two sites are both negatively charged, there will be a charge-charge repulsion along the backbone of the polymer than tends to stretch the chain. This energy cost is high both elastically and electrostatically and hence suppress ionization. Even though this ionization suppression is qualitatively similar to that of Donnan prediction, it is absent without electrostatic consideration and present irrespective of ion partitioning. The combination of both effects as well as gel elasticity determines the volume of the gel at equilibrium. Due to the complexity of the coupled acid-base equilibrium, electrostatics and network elasticity, only recently has such system been correctly recreated in computer simulations.

== Animal-produced gels ==
Some species secrete gels that are effective in parasite control. For example, the long-finned pilot whale secretes an enzymatic gel that rests on the outer surface of this animal and helps prevent other organisms from establishing colonies on the surface of these whales&#x27; bodies.

Hydrogels existing naturally in the body include mucus, the vitreous humor of the eye, cartilage, tendons and blood clots. Their viscoelastic nature results in the soft tissue component of the body, disparate from the mineral-based hard tissue of the skeletal system. Researchers are actively developing synthetically derived tissue replacement technologies derived from hydrogels, for both temporary implants (degradable) and permanent implants (non-degradable). A review article on the subject discusses the use of hydrogels for nucleus pulposus replacement, cartilage replacement, and synthetic tissue models.

==Applications==
Many substances can form gels when a suitable thickener or gelling agent is added to their formula. This approach is common in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from foods to paints and adhesives.

In fiber optic communications, a soft gel resembling hair gel in viscosity is used to fill the plastic tubes containing the fibers. The main purpose of the gel is to prevent water intrusion if the buffer tube is breached, but the gel also buffers the fibers against mechanical damage when the tube is bent around corners during installation, or flexed. Additionally, the gel acts as a processing aid when the cable is being constructed, keeping the fibers central whilst the tube material is extruded around it.

<text>A geostationary orbit, also referred to as a geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO), is a circular geosynchronous orbit in altitude above Earth&#x27;s equator, in radius from Earth&#x27;s center, and following the direction of Earth&#x27;s rotation.

An object in such an orbit has an orbital period equal to Earth&#x27;s rotational period, one sidereal day, and so to ground observers it appears motionless, in a fixed position in the sky. The concept of a geostationary orbit was popularised by the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke in the 1940s as a way to revolutionise telecommunications, and the first satellite to be placed in this kind of orbit was launched in 1963.

Communications satellites are often placed in a geostationary orbit so that Earth-based satellite antennas do not have to rotate to track them but can be pointed permanently at the position in the sky where the satellites are located. Weather satellites are also placed in this orbit for real-time monitoring and data collection, and navigation satellites to provide a known calibration point and enhance GPS accuracy.

Geostationary satellites are launched via a temporary orbit, and then placed in a &quot;slot&quot; above a particular point on the Earth&#x27;s surface. The satellite requires periodic station-keeping to maintain its position. Modern retired geostationary satellites are placed in a higher graveyard orbit to avoid collisions.

== History ==

In 1929, Herman Potočnik described both geosynchronous orbits in general and the special case of the geostationary Earth orbit in particular as useful orbits for space stations. The first appearance of a geostationary orbit in popular literature was in October 1942, in the first Venus Equilateral story by George O. Smith, but Smith did not go into details. British science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke popularised and expanded the concept in a 1945 paper entitled &quot;Extra-Terrestrial Relays – Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?&quot;, published in &quot;Wireless World&quot; magazine. Clarke acknowledged the connection in his introduction to &quot;The Complete Venus Equilateral&quot;. The orbit, which Clarke first described as useful for broadcast and relay communications satellites, is sometimes called the Clarke orbit. Similarly, the collection of artificial satellites in this orbit is known as the Clarke Belt.

In technical terminology the orbit is referred to as either a geostationary or geosynchronous equatorial orbit, with the terms used somewhat interchangeably.

The first geostationary satellite was designed by Harold Rosen while he was working at Hughes Aircraft in 1959. Inspired by Sputnik 1, he wanted to use a geostationary satellite to globalise communications. Telecommunications between the US and Europe was then possible between just 136 people at a time, and reliant on high frequency radios and an undersea cable.

Conventional wisdom at the time was that it would require too much rocket power to place a satellite in a geostationary orbit and it would not survive long enough to justify the expense, so early efforts were put towards constellations of satellites in low or medium Earth orbit. The first of these were the passive Echo balloon satellites in 1960, followed by Telstar 1 in 1962. Although these projects had difficulties with signal strength and tracking, issues that could be solved using geostationary orbits, the concept was seen as impractical, so Hughes often withheld funds and support.

By 1961, Rosen and his team had produced a cylindrical prototype with a diameter of , height of , weighing , light and small enough to be placed into orbit. It was spin stabilised with a dipole antenna producing a pancake shaped beam. In August 1961, they were contracted to begin building the real satellite. They lost Syncom 1 to electronics failure, but Syncom 2 was successfully placed into a geosynchronous orbit in 1963. Although its inclined orbit still required moving antennas, it was able to relay TV transmissions, and allowed for US President John F. Kennedy in Washington D.C., to phone Nigerian prime minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa aboard the USNS Kingsport docked in Lagos on August 23, 1963.

The first satellite placed in a geostationary orbit was Syncom 3, which was launched by a Delta D rocket in 1964. With its increased bandwidth, this satellite was able to transmit live coverage of the Summer Olympics from Japan to America. Geostationary orbits have been in common use ever since, in particular for satellite television.

Today there are hundreds of geostationary satellites providing remote sensing and communications.

Although most populated land locations on the planet now have terrestrial communications facilities (microwave, fiber-optic), with telephone access covering 96% of the population and internet access 90%, some rural and remote areas in developed countries are still reliant on satellite communications.

== Uses ==
Most commercial communications satellites, broadcast satellites and SBAS satellites operate in geostationary orbits.

=== Communications ===
Geostationary communication satellites are useful because they are visible from a large area of the earth&#x27;s surface, extending 81° away in latitude and 77° in longitude. They appear stationary in the sky, which eliminates the need for ground stations to have movable antennas. This means that Earth-based observers can erect small, cheap and stationary antennas that are always directed at the desired satellite. However, latency becomes significant as it takes about 240 ms for a signal to pass from a ground based transmitter on the equator to the satellite and back again. This delay presents problems for latency-sensitive applications such as voice communication, so geostationary communication satellites are primarily used for unidirectional entertainment and applications where low latency alternatives are not available.

Geostationary satellites are directly overhead at the equator and appear lower in the sky to an observer nearer the poles. As the observer&#x27;s latitude increases, communication becomes more difficult due to factors such as atmospheric refraction, Earth&#x27;s thermal emission, line-of-sight obstructions, and signal reflections from the ground or nearby structures. At latitudes above about 81°, geostationary satellites are below the horizon and cannot be seen at all. Because of this, some Russian communication satellites have used elliptical Molniya and Tundra orbits, which have excellent visibility at high latitudes.

=== Meteorology ===
A worldwide network of operational geostationary meteorological satellites is used to provide visible and infrared images of Earth&#x27;s surface and atmosphere for weather observation, oceanography, and atmospheric tracking. As of 2019 there are 19 satellites in either operation or stand-by. These satellite systems include:
* the United States&#x27; GOES series, operated by NOAA
* the Meteosat series, launched by the European Space Agency and operated by the European Weather Satellite Organization, EUMETSAT
* the Republic of Korea COMS-1 and GK-2A multi mission satellites.
* the Russian Elektro-L satellites
* the Japanese Himawari series
* Chinese Fengyun series
* India&#x27;s INSAT series

These satellites typically capture images in the visual and infrared spectrum with a spatial resolution between 0.5 and 4 square kilometres. The coverage is typically 70°, and in some cases less.

Geostationary satellite imagery has been used for tracking volcanic ash, measuring cloud top temperatures and water vapour, oceanography, measuring land temperature and vegetation coverage, facilitating cyclone path prediction, and providing real time cloud coverage and other tracking data. Some information has been incorporated into meteorological prediction models, but due to their wide field of view, full-time monitoring and lower resolution, geostationary weather satellite images are primarily used for short-term and real-time forecasting.

===Navigation===


Geostationary satellites can be used to augment GNSS systems by relaying clock, ephemeris and ionospheric error corrections (calculated from ground stations of a known position) and providing an additional reference signal. This improves position accuracy from approximately 5m to 1m or less.

Past and current navigation systems that use geostationary satellites include:
* The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), operated by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA);
* The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), operated by the ESSP (on behalf of EU&#x27;s GSA);
* The Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), operated by Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Japan Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB);
* The GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) system being operated by India.
* The commercial StarFire navigation system, operated by John Deere and C-Nav Positioning Solutions (Oceaneering);
* The commercial Starfix DGPS System and OmniSTAR system, operated by Fugro.

==Implementation==

===Launch===

Geostationary satellites are launched to the east into a prograde orbit that matches the rotation rate of the equator. The smallest inclination that a satellite can be launched into is that of the launch site&#x27;s latitude, so launching the satellite from close to the equator limits the amount of inclination change needed later. Additionally, launching from close to the equator allows the speed of the Earth&#x27;s rotation to give the satellite a boost. A launch site should have water or deserts to the east, so any failed rockets do not fall on a populated area.

Most launch vehicles place geostationary satellites directly into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), an elliptical orbit with an apogee at GEO height and a low perigee. On-board satellite propulsion is then used to raise the perigee, circularise and reach GEO.

=== Orbit allocation ===

Satellites in geostationary orbit must all occupy a single ring above the equator. The requirement to space these satellites apart, to avoid harmful radio-frequency interference during operations, means that there are a limited number of orbital slots available, and thus only a limited number of satellites can be operated in geostationary orbit. This has led to conflict between different countries wishing access to the same orbital slots (countries near the same longitude but differing latitudes) and radio frequencies. These disputes are addressed through the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s allocation mechanism under the Radio Regulations. In the 1976 Bogota Declaration, eight countries located on the Earth&#x27;s equator claimed sovereignty over the geostationary orbits above their territory, but the claims gained no international recognition.

===Statite proposal===
A statite is a hypothetical satellite that uses radiation pressure from the sun against a solar sail to modify its orbit.

It would hold its location over the dark side of the Earth at a latitude of approximately 30 degrees. A statite is stationary relative to the Earth and Sun system rather than compared to surface of the Earth, and could ease congestion in the geostationary ring.

== Retired satellites ==

Geostationary satellites require some station keeping to keep their position, and once they run out of thruster fuel they are generally retired. The transponders and other onboard systems often outlive the thruster fuel and by allowing the satellite to move naturally into an inclined geosynchronous orbit some satellites can remain in use, or else be elevated to a graveyard orbit. This process is becoming increasingly regulated and satellites must have a 90% chance of moving over 200 km above the geostationary belt at end of life.

=== Space debris ===


Space debris at geostationary orbits typically has a lower collision speed than at low Earth orbit (LEO) since all GEO satellites orbit in the same plane, altitude and speed; however, the presence of satellites in eccentric orbits allows for collisions at up to . Although a collision is comparatively unlikely, GEO satellites have a limited ability to avoid any debris.

At geosynchronous altitude, objects less than 10 cm in diameter cannot be seen from the Earth, making it difficult to assess their prevalence.

Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The European Space Agency telecom satellite Olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on August 11, 1993, and eventually moved to a graveyard orbit, and in 2006 the Russian Express-AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable, although its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit. In 2017, both AMC-9 and Telkom-1 broke apart from an unknown cause.

==Properties==

A typical geostationary orbit has the following properties:
* Inclination: 0°
* Period: 1436 minutes (one sidereal day)
* Eccentricity: 0
* Argument of perigee: undefined
* Semi-major axis: 42,164 km

===Inclination===
An inclination of zero ensures that the orbit remains over the equator at all times, making it stationary with respect to latitude from the point of view of a ground observer (and in the Earth-centered Earth-fixed reference frame).

===Period===
The orbital period is equal to exactly one sidereal day. This means that the satellite will return to the same point above the Earth&#x27;s surface every (sidereal) day, regardless of other orbital properties. For a geostationary orbit in particular, it ensures that it holds the same longitude over time. This orbital period, &quot;T&quot;, is directly related to the semi-major axis of the orbit through the formula:

: formula_1

where:
* is the length of the orbit&#x27;s semi-major axis
* is the standard gravitational parameter of the central body

===Eccentricity===
The eccentricity is zero, which produces a circular orbit. This ensures that the satellite does not move closer or further away from the Earth, which would cause it to track backwards and forwards across the sky.

== Stability ==
A geostationary orbit can be achieved only at an altitude very close to and directly above the equator. This equates to an orbital speed of and an orbital period of 1,436 minutes, one sidereal day. This ensures that the satellite will match the Earth&#x27;s rotational period and has a stationary footprint on the ground. All geostationary satellites have to be located on this ring.

A combination of lunar gravity, solar gravity, and the flattening of the Earth at its poles causes a precession motion of the orbital plane of any geostationary object, with an orbital period of about 53 years and an initial inclination gradient of about 0.85° per year, achieving a maximal inclination of 15° after 26.5 years. To correct for this perturbation, regular orbital stationkeeping maneuvers are necessary, amounting to a delta-v of approximately 50 m/s per year.

A second effect to be taken into account is the longitudinal drift, caused by the asymmetry of the Earth – the equator is slightly elliptical (equatorial eccentricity). There are two stable equilibrium points sometimes called &quot;gravitational wells&quot; (at 75.3°E and 108°W) and two corresponding unstable points (at 165.3°E and 14.7°W). Any geostationary object placed between the equilibrium points would (without any action) be slowly accelerated towards the stable equilibrium position, causing a periodic longitude variation. The correction of this effect requires station-keeping maneuvers with a maximal delta-v of about 2 m/s per year, depending on the desired longitude.

Solar wind and radiation pressure also exert small forces on satellites: over time, these cause them to slowly drift away from their prescribed orbits.

In the absence of servicing missions from the Earth or a renewable propulsion method, the consumption of thruster propellant for station-keeping places a limitation on the lifetime of the satellite. Hall-effect thrusters, which are currently in use, have the potential to prolong the service life of a satellite by providing high-efficiency electric propulsion.

== Derivation ==
For circular orbits around a body, the centripetal force required to maintain the orbit (&quot;F&quot;c) is equal to the gravitational force acting on the satellite (&quot;F&quot;g):

: formula_2

From Isaac Newton&#x27;s universal law of gravitation,

:formula_3,

where &quot;F&quot;g is the gravitational force acting between two objects, &quot;M&quot;E is the mass of the Earth, , &quot;m&quot;s is the mass of the satellite, &quot;r&quot; is the distance between the centers of their masses, and &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant, .

The magnitude of the acceleration, &quot;a&quot;, of a body moving in a circle is given by:

:formula_4

where &quot;v&quot; is the magnitude of the velocity (i.e. the speed) of the satellite. From Newton&#x27;s second law of motion, the centripetal force &quot;F&quot;c is given by:

:formula_5.

As &quot;F&quot;c = &quot;F&quot;g,

:formula_6,

so that

:formula_7

Replacing &quot;v&quot; with the equation for the speed of an object moving around a circle produces:

:formula_8

where &quot;T&quot; is the orbital period (i.e. one sidereal day), and is equal to . This gives an equation for &quot;r&quot;:

:formula_9

The product &quot;GM&quot;E is known with much greater precision than either factor alone; it is known as the geocentric gravitational constant &quot;μ&quot; = . Hence

:formula_10

The resulting orbital radius is . Subtracting the Earth&#x27;s equatorial radius, , gives the altitude of .

The orbital speed is calculated by multiplying the angular speed by the orbital radius:

: formula_11

==In other planets==
By the same method, we can determine the orbital altitude for any similar pair of bodies, including the areostationary orbit of an object in relation to Mars, if it is assumed that it is spherical (which it is not entirely). The gravitational constant &quot;GM&quot; (&quot;μ&quot;) for Mars has the value of , its equatorial radius is and the known rotational period (&quot;T&quot;) of the planet is (). Using these values, Mars&#x27; orbital altitude is equal to .

<text>A graded-index fiber, or gradient-index fiber, is an optical fiber whose core has a refractive index that decreases &quot;continuously&quot; with increasing radial distance from the optical axis of the fiber, as opposed to a step-index fiber, which has a uniform index of refraction in the core, and a lower index in the surrounding cladding.

Because parts of the core closer to the fiber axis have a higher refractive index than the parts near the cladding, light rays follow sinusoidal paths down the fiber. The most common refractive index profile for a graded-index fiber is very nearly parabolic. The parabolic profile results in continual refocusing of the rays in the core, and minimizes modal dispersion.

Multi-mode optical fiber can be built with either a graded-index or a step-index profile. The advantage of graded-index multi-mode fiber compared to step-index fiber is a considerable decrease in modal dispersion. This means that the trip time of photons traversing the fiber is more consistent, allowing shorter and more frequent pulses of light to be discerned by the receiver. Modal dispersion can be further decreased by selecting a smaller core size (less than 10 μm) and forming a single-mode step index fiber.

This type of fiber is normalized by the International Telecommunication Union ITU-T in recommendation G.651.1.

==Pulse dispersion==
Pulse dispersion in a graded-index optical fiber is given by

formula_1
where

formula_2 is the difference in refractive indices of core and cladding,

formula_3 is the refractive index of the cladding,

formula_4 is the length of the fiber taken for observing the pulse dispersion,

formula_5 is the speed of light, and

formula_6 is the constant of graded index profile.

<doc id="41212" wikidata="Q5591862" url="?curid=41212" title="Grade of service">
<text>In telecommunications engineering, and in particular teletraffic engineering, the quality of voice service is specified by two measures: the grade of service (GoS) and the [[quality of service]] (QoS).

Grade of service is the probability of a call in a circuit &quot;group&quot; being blocked or delayed for more than a specified interval, expressed as a vulgar fraction or decimal fraction. This is always with reference to the busy hour when the traffic intensity is the greatest. Grade of service may be viewed independently from the perspective of incoming versus outgoing calls, and is not necessarily equal in each direction or between different source-destination pairs. &quot;Grade of Service&quot; sometimes means a measure of inbound call center traffic to verify adherence to conditions to measure the success of customers served.

On the other hand, the quality of service which a &quot;single&quot; circuit is designed or conditioned to provide, e.g. voice grade or program grade is called the quality of service. Quality criteria for such circuits may include equalization for amplitude over a specified band of frequencies, or in the case of digital data transported via analogue circuits, may include equalization for phase. Criteria for mobile quality of service in cellular telephone circuits include the probability of abnormal termination of the call.

==What is Grade of Service and how is it measured?==
When a user attempts to make a telephone call, the routing equipment handling the call has to determine whether to accept the call, reroute the call to alternative equipment, or reject the call entirely. Rejected calls occur as a result of heavy traffic loads (congestion) on the system and can result in the call either being delayed or lost. If a call is delayed, the user simply has to wait for the traffic to decrease, however if a call is lost then it is removed from the system.

The Grade of Service is one aspect of the quality a customer can expect to experience when making a telephone call. In a Loss System, the Grade of Service is described as that proportion of calls that are lost due to congestion in the busy hour. 
For a Lost Call system, the Grade of Service can be measured using &quot;Equation 1&quot;.

:formula_1

For a delayed call system, the Grade of Service is measured using three separate terms:

*The mean delay formula_2 – Describes the average time a user spends waiting for a connection if their call is delayed.
*The mean delay formula_3 – Describes the average time a user spends waiting for a connection whether or not their call is delayed.
*The probability that a user may be delayed longer than time &quot;t&quot; while waiting for a connection. Time &quot;t&quot; is chosen by the telecommunications service provider so that they can measure whether their services conform to a set Grade of Service.
* Where and when is Grade of Service measured?
The Grade of Service can be measured using different sections of a network. When a call is routed from one end to another, it will pass through several exchanges. If the Grade of Service is calculated based on the number of calls rejected by the final circuit group, then the Grade of Service is determined by the final circuit group blocking criteria. If the Grade of Service is calculated based on the number of rejected calls between exchanges, then the Grade of Service is determined by the exchange-to-exchange blocking criteria.

The Grade of Service should be calculated using both the access networks and the core networks as it is these networks that allow a user to complete an end-to-end connection. Furthermore, the Grade of Service should be calculated from the average of the busy hour traffic intensities of the 30 busiest traffic days of the year. This will cater for most scenarios as the traffic intensity will seldom exceed the reference level.

The grade of service is a measure of the ability of a user to access a trunk system during the busiest hour. The busy is based upon customer demand at the busiest hour during a week month or year.

==Class of Service==
Different telecommunications applications require different Qualities of Service. For example, if a telecommunications service provider decides to offer different qualities of voice connection, then a premium voice connection will require a better connection quality compared to an ordinary voice connection. Thus different Qualities of Service are appropriate, depending on the intended use. To help telecommunications service providers to market their different services, each service is placed into a specific class. Each Class of Service determines the level of service required.

To identify the Class of Service for a specific service, the network&#x27;s switches and routers examine the call based on several factors. Such factors can include:

*The type of service and priority due to precedence
*The identity of the initiating party
*The identity of the recipient party

==Quality of Service in broadband networks==
In broadband networks, the Quality of Service is measured using two criteria. The first criterion is the probability of packet losses or delays in already accepted calls. The second criterion refers to the probability that a new incoming call will be rejected or blocked. To avoid the former, broadband networks limit the number of active calls so that packets from established calls will not be lost due to new calls arriving. As in circuit-switched networks, the Grade of Service can be calculated for individual switches or for the whole network.

==Maintaining a Grade of Service==
The telecommunications provider is usually aware of the required Grade of Service for a particular product. To achieve and maintain a given Grade of Service, the operator must ensure that sufficient telecommunications circuits or routes are available to meet a specific level of demand. It should also be kept in mind that too many circuits will create a situation where the operator is providing excess capacity which may never be used, or at the very least may be severely underutilized. This adds costs which must be borne by other parts of the network. To determine the correct number of circuits that are required, telecommunications service providers make use of Traffic Tables. An example of a Traffic Table can be viewed in &quot;Figure 1&quot;. It follows that in order for a telecommunications network to continue to offer a given Grade of Service, the number of circuits provided in a circuit group must increase (non-linearly) if the traffic intensity increases.

==Erlang&#x27;s lost call assumptions==
To calculate the Grade of Service of a specified group of circuits or routes, Agner Krarup Erlang used a set of assumptions that relied on the network losing calls when all circuits in a group were busy. These assumptions are:

*All traffic through the network is pure-chance traffic, i.e. all call arrivals and terminations are independent random events
*There is statistical equilibrium, i.e., the average number of calls does not change
*Full availability of the network, i.e., every outlet from a switch is accessible from every inlet
*Any call that encounters congestion is immediately lost.

From these assumptions Erlang developed the Erlang-B formula which describes the probability of congestion in a circuit group. The probability of congestion gives the Grade of Service experienced.

==Calculating the Grade of Service==
To determine the Grade of Service of a network when the traffic load and number of circuits are known, telecommunications network operators make use of &quot;Equation 2&quot;, which is the Erlang-B equation.

:formula_4

&quot;A&quot; = Expected traffic intensity in Erlangs,
&quot;N&quot; = Number of circuits in group.

This equation allows operators to determine whether each of their circuit groups meet the required Grade of Service, simply by monitoring the reference traffic intensity.

(For delay networks, the Erlang-C formula allows network operators to determine the probability of delay depending on peak traffic and the number of circuits.)

<text>In ISO/IEC 646 (commonly known as ASCII) and related standards including ISO 8859 and Unicode, a graphic character, also known as printing character (or printable character), is any character intended to be written, printed, or otherwise displayed in a form that can be read by humans. In other words, it is any encoded character that is associated with one or more glyphs.

==ISO/IEC 646==
In ISO 646, graphic characters are contained in rows 2 through 7 of the code table. However, two of the characters in these rows, namely the space character SP at row 2 column 0 and the delete character DEL (also called the rubout character) at row 7 column 15, require special mention.

The space is considered to be &quot;both&quot; a graphic character and a control character in ISO 646. It can be considered as a character with a visible form or, in contexts such as teleprinters, a control character that advances the print head without printing a character.

The delete character is strictly a control character, not a graphic character. This is true not only in ISO 646, but also in all related standards including Unicode. However, many other character sets deviate from ISO 646, and as a result a graphic character might occupy the position originally reserved for the delete character.

==Unicode==
In Unicode, Graphic characters are those with General Category Letter, Mark, Number, Punctuation, Symbol or Zs=space. Other code points (General categories Control, Zl=line separator, Zp=paragraph separator) are Format, Control, Private Use, Surrogate, Noncharacter or Reserved (unassigned).

== Spacing and non-spacing characters ==
Most graphic characters are spacing characters, which means that each instance of a spacing character has to occupy some area in a graphic representation. For a teletype or a typewriter this implies moving of the carriage after typing of a character. In the context of text mode display, each spacing character occupies one rectangular character box of equal sizes. Or maybe two adjacent ones, for non-alphabetic characters of East Asian languages. If a text is rendered using proportional fonts, widths of character boxes are not equal, but are positive.

There exist also &quot;non-spacing&quot; graphic characters. Most of non-spacing characters are &quot;&quot;, also called combining characters in Unicode, such as diacritical marks. Although non-spacing graphic characters are uncommon in traditional code pages, there are many such in Unicode. A combining character has its distinct glyph, but it applies to a character box of another character, a spacing one. In some historical systems such as line printers this was implemented as overstrike.

Note that not all modifiers are non-spacing – there exists Spacing Modifier Letters Unicode block.

<text>In electrical engineering, ground or earth may be a reference point in an electrical circuit from which voltages are measured, a common return path for electric current, or a direct physical connection to the Earth.

Electrical circuits may be connected to ground for several reasons. Exposed conductive parts of electrical equipment are connected to ground to protect users from electrical shock hazards. If internal insulation fails, dangerous voltages may appear on the exposed conductive parts. Connecting exposed conductive parts to a &quot;ground&quot; wire which provides a low-impedance path for current to flow back to the incoming neutral (which is also connected to ground, close to the point of entry) will allow circuit breakers (or RCDs) to interrupt power supply in the event of a fault. In electric power distribution systems, a protective earth (PE) conductor is an essential part of the safety provided by the earthing system.

Connection to ground also limits the build-up of static electricity when handling flammable products or electrostatic-sensitive devices. In some telegraph and power transmission circuits, the ground itself can be used as one conductor of the circuit, saving the cost of installing a separate return conductor (see single-wire earth return and earth-return telegraph).

For measurement purposes, the Earth serves as a (reasonably) constant potential reference against which other potentials can be measured. An electrical ground system should have an appropriate current-carrying capability to serve as an adequate zero-voltage reference level. In electronic circuit theory, a &quot;ground&quot; is usually idealized as an infinite source or sink for charge, which can absorb an unlimited amount of current without changing its potential. Where a real ground connection has a significant resistance, the approximation of zero potential is no longer valid. Stray voltages or earth potential rise effects will occur, which may create noise in signals or produce an electric shock hazard if large enough.

The use of the term ground (or earth) is so common in electrical and electronics applications that circuits in portable electronic devices, such as cell phones and media players, as well as circuits in vehicles, may be spoken of as having a &quot;ground&quot; or chassis ground connection without any actual connection to the Earth, despite &quot;common&quot; being a more appropriate term for such a connection. That is usually a large conductor attached to one side of the power supply (such as the &quot;ground plane&quot; on a printed circuit board), which serves as the common return path for current from many different components in the circuit.

== History ==

Long-distance electromagnetic telegraph systems from 1820 onwards
used two or more wires to carry the signal and return currents. It was discovered by German scientist  in 1836–1837, that the ground could be used as the return path to complete the circuit, making the return wire unnecessary.
Steinheil was not the first to do this, but he was not aware of earlier experimental work, and he was the first to do it on an in-service telegraph, thus making the principle known to telegraph engineers generally. However, there were problems with this system, exemplified by the transcontinental telegraph line constructed in 1861 by the Western Union Company between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California. During dry weather, the ground connection often developed a high resistance, requiring water to be poured on the ground rod to enable the telegraph to work or phones to ring.

In the late nineteenth century, when telephony began to replace telegraphy, it was found that the currents in the earth induced by power systems, electric railways, other telephone and telegraph circuits, and natural sources including lightning caused unacceptable interference to the audio signals, and the two-wire or &#x27;metallic circuit&#x27; system was reintroduced around 1883.

== Building wiring installations ==

Electrical power distribution systems are often connected to earth ground to limit the voltage that can appear on distribution circuits. A distribution system insulated from earth ground may attain a high potential due to transient voltages caused by static electricity or accidental contact with higher potential circuits. An earth ground connection of the system dissipates such potentials and limits the rise in voltage of the grounded system.

In a mains electricity (AC power) wiring installation, the term &quot;ground conductor&quot; typically refers to two different conductors or conductor systems as listed below:
&quot;Equipment bonding conductors&quot; or &quot;equipment ground conductors&quot; (EGC) provide a low-impedance path between normally non-current-carrying metallic parts of equipment and one of the conductors of that electrical system&#x27;s source. If any exposed metal part should become energized (fault), such as by a frayed or damaged insulator, it creates a short circuit, causing the overcurrent device (circuit breaker or fuse) to open, clearing (disconnecting) the fault. It is important to note this action occurs regardless of whether there is a connection to the physical ground (earth); the earth itself has no role in this fault-clearing process since current must return to its source; however, the sources are very frequently connected to the physical ground (earth). (see Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws). By bonding (interconnecting) all exposed non-current carrying metal objects together, as well as to other metallic objects such as pipes or structural steel, they should remain near the same voltage potential, thus reducing the chance of a shock. This is especially important in bathrooms where one may be in contact with several different metallic systems such as supply and drain pipes and appliance frames. When a conductive system is to be electrically connected to the physical ground (earth), one puts the equipment bonding conductor and the grounding electrode conductor at the same potential (for example, see &quot;§Metal water pipe as grounding electrode&quot; below).

A (GEC) is used to connect the system grounded (&quot;neutral&quot;) conductor, or the equipment to a grounding electrode, or a point on the grounding electrode system. This is called &quot;system grounding&quot; and most electrical systems are required to be grounded. The U.S. NEC and the UK&#x27;s BS 7671 list systems that are required to be grounded. According to the NEC, the purpose of connecting an electrical system to the physical ground (earth) is to limit the voltage imposed by lightning events and contact with higher voltage lines. In the past, water supply pipes were used as grounding electrodes, but due to the increased use of plastic pipes, which are poor conductors, the use of a specific grounding electrode is often mandated by regulating authorities. The same type of ground applies to radio antennas and to lightning protection systems.

Permanently installed electrical equipment, unless not required to, has permanently connected grounding conductors. Portable electrical devices with metal cases may have them connected to earth ground by a pin on the attachment plug (see AC power plugs and sockets). The size of power grounding conductors is usually regulated by local or national wiring regulations.

=== Bonding ===

Strictly speaking, the terms &quot;grounding&quot; or &quot;earthing&quot; are meant to refer to an electrical connection to ground/earth. Bonding is the practice of intentionally electrically connecting metallic items not designed to carry electricity. This brings all the bonded items to the same electrical potential as a protection from electrical shock. The bonded items can then be connected to ground to eliminate foreign voltages.

=== Earthing systems ===

In electricity supply systems, an earthing (grounding) system defines the electrical potential of the conductors relative to that of the Earth&#x27;s conductive surface. The choice of earthing system has implications for the safety and electromagnetic compatibility of the power supply. Regulations for earthing systems vary considerably between different countries.

A functional earth connection serves more than protecting against electrical shock, as such a connection may carry current during the normal operation of a device. Such devices include surge suppression, electromagnetic-compatibility filters, some types of antennas, and various measurement instruments. Generally the protective earth system is also used as a functional earth, though this requires care.

=== Impedance grounding ===
Distribution power systems may be solidly grounded, with one circuit conductor directly connected to an earth grounding electrode system. Alternatively, some amount of electrical impedance may be connected between the distribution system and ground, to limit the current that can flow to earth. The impedance may be a resistor, or an inductor (coil). In a high-impedance grounded system, the fault current is limited to a few amperes (exact values depend on the voltage class of the system); a low-impedance grounded system will permit several hundred amperes to flow on a fault. A large solidly grounded distribution system may have tens of thousands of amperes of ground fault current.

In a polyphase AC system, the instantaneous vector sum of the phases is zero. This neutral point is commonly used to refer the phase voltages to earth ground instead of connecting one of the phase conductors to earth. Any Δ-Y (delta-wye) connected transformer may be used for the purpose. A nine winding transformer (a &quot;zig zag&quot; transformer) may be used to balance the phase currents of a delta connected source with an unbalanced load.

Low-resistance grounding systems use a neutral grounding resistor (NGR) to limit the fault current to 25 A or greater. Low resistance grounding systems will have a time rating (say, 10 seconds) that indicates how long the resistor can carry the fault current before overheating. A ground fault protection relay must trip the breaker to protect the circuit before overheating of the resistor occurs.

High-resistance grounding (HRG) systems use an NGR to limit the fault current to 25 A or less. They have a continuous rating, and are designed to operate with a single-ground fault. This means that the system will not immediately trip on the first ground fault. If a second ground fault occurs, a ground fault protection relay must trip the breaker to protect the circuit. On an HRG system, a sensing resistor is used to continuously monitor system continuity. If an open-circuit is detected (e.g., due to a broken weld on the NGR), the monitoring device will sense voltage through the sensing resistor and trip the breaker. Without a sensing resistor, the system could continue to operate without ground protection (since an open circuit condition would mask the ground fault) and transient overvoltages could occur.

===Ungrounded systems===
Where the danger of electric shock is high, special ungrounded power systems may be used to minimize possible leakage current to ground. Examples of such installations include patient care areas in hospitals, where medical equipment is directly connected to a patient and must not permit any power-line current to pass into the patient&#x27;s body. Medical systems include monitoring devices to warn of any increase of leakage current. On wet construction sites or in shipyards, isolation transformers may be provided so that a fault in a power tool or its cable does not expose users to shock hazard.

Circuits used to feed sensitive audio/video production equipment or measurement instruments may be fed from an isolated ungrounded technical power system to limit the injection of noise from the power system.

== Power transmission ==
In single-wire earth return (SWER) AC electrical distribution systems, costs are saved by using just a single high voltage conductor for the power grid, while routing the AC return current through the earth. This system is mostly used in rural areas where large earth currents will not otherwise cause hazards.

Some high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) power transmission systems use the ground as second conductor. This is especially common in schemes with submarine cables, as sea water is a good conductor. Buried grounding electrodes are used to make the connection to the earth. The site of these electrodes must be chosen carefully to prevent electrochemical corrosion on underground structures.

A particular concern in design of electrical substations is earth potential rise. When very large fault currents are injected into the earth, the area around the point of injection may rise to a high potential with respect to points distant from it. This is due to the limited finite conductivity of the layers of soil in the earth of the substation. The gradient of the voltage (the change in voltage across the distance to the injection point) may be so high that two points on the ground may be at significantly different potentials. This gradient creates a hazard to anyone standing on the earth in an area of the electrical substation that is insufficiently insulated from ground. Pipes, rails, or communication wires entering a substation may see different ground potentials inside and outside the substation, creating a dangerous touch voltage for unsuspecting persons who might touch those pipes, rails, or wires. This problem is alleviated by creating a low-impedance equipotential bonding plane installed in accordance with IEEE 80, within the substation. This plane eliminates voltage gradients and ensures that any fault is cleared within three voltage cycles.

Signal grounds serve as return paths for signals and power (at extra-low voltages, less than about 50 V) within equipment, and on the signal interconnections between equipment. Many electronic designs feature a single return that acts as a reference for all signals. Power and signal grounds often get connected, usually through the metal case of the equipment. Designers of printed circuit boards must take care in the layout of electronic systems so that high-power or rapidly switching currents in one part of a system do not inject noise into low-level sensitive parts of a system due to some common impedance in the grounding traces of the layout.

=== Circuit ground versus earth ===
Voltage is defined as the difference of electric potentials between points in an electric field. A voltmeter is used to measure the potential difference between some point and a convenient, but otherwise arbitrary reference point. This common reference point is denoted &quot;ground&quot; and is designated as having a nominal zero potential. Signals are defined with respect to signal ground, which may be connected to a power ground. A system where the system ground is not connected to another circuit or to earth (in which there may still be AC coupling between those circuits) is often referred to as a floating ground, and may correspond to Class 0 or Class II appliances.

=== Functional grounds ===
Some devices require a connection to the mass of earth to function correctly, as distinct from any purely protective role. Such a connection is known as a functional earthfor example some long wavelength antenna structures require a functional earth connection, which generally should not be indiscriminately connected to the supply protective earth, as the introduction of transmitted radio frequencies into the electrical distribution network is both illegal and potentially dangerous. Because of this separation, a purely functional ground should not normally be relied upon to perform a protective function.
To avoid accidents, such functional grounds are normally wired in white, cream or pink cable, and not green or green/yellow.

=== Separating low signal ground from a noisy ground ===

In television stations, recording studios, and other installations where signal quality is critical, a special signal ground known as a &quot;technical ground&quot; (or &quot;technical earth&quot;, &quot;special earth&quot;, and &quot;audio earth&quot;) is often installed, to prevent ground loops. This is basically the same thing as an AC power ground, but no general appliance ground wires are allowed any connection to it, as they may carry electrical interference. For example, only audio equipment is connected to the technical ground in a recording studio. In most cases, the studio&#x27;s metal equipment racks are all joined with heavy copper cables (or flattened copper tubing or busbars) and similar connections are made to the technical ground. Great care is taken that no general chassis grounded appliances are placed on the racks, as a single AC ground connection to the technical ground will destroy its effectiveness. For particularly demanding applications, the main technical ground may consist of a heavy copper pipe, if necessary fitted by drilling through several concrete floors, such that all technical grounds may be connected by the shortest possible path to a grounding rod in the basement.

== Radio frequency ground ==

Certain types of radio antennas (or their feedlines) require a connection to ground that functions adequately at radio frequencies. The required caliber of grounding system is called a &quot;radio frequency ground&quot;. In general, a radio transmitter, its power source, and its antenna will require three functionally different grounds:
# A lightning safety ground (perhaps several) that discharges lightning strikes on an outdoor antenna, and separately one that diverts residual strike current from entering the house / radio shack / radio equipment
# An electrical power safety ground, provided by the ground connection at the electrical outlet
# A radio frequency ground that establishes a low-resistance return path for the electrical field produced by the antenna during the process of creating radiated waves.
Although some of these grounds might be combined, and should be connected at exactly one point, only the last type of ground is covered in this section. Lightning safety grounding (1) is covered in the following section, not here. The electrical safety ground (2) was discussed in previous sections and is unsuitable for radio purposes, although required for the power supply. The radio frequency ground (3) is the topic of this section.

Since the radio frequencies of the current in antennas are far higher than the 50 or 60 Hz frequency of the power line, radio grounding systems use different principles than AC power grounding. The &quot;protective earth&quot; (PE) safety ground wires in AC utility building wiring were not designed for, and cannot be used as an adequate substitute for an RF ground. The long utility ground wires have high impedance at certain frequencies. In the case of a transmitter, the RF current flowing through the ground wires can radiate radio frequency interference and induce hazardous voltages on grounded metal parts of other appliances, so separate ground systems are used.

Monopole antennas operating at lower frequencies, below 20 MHz, use the surface of the Earth as a part of the antenna, as a conductive plane to reflect the radio waves and provide a return path for electric fields extending from the antenna. The monopoles include the mast radiator used by AM radio stations, and the &#x27;T&#x27; and inverted &#x27;L&#x27; antenna, and umbrella antenna. The feedline from the transmitter is connected between the antenna and ground, so it requires a grounding (earthing) system under the antenna to make contact with the soil to collect the return current. The ground system also functions as a capacitor plate, to receive the displacement current from the antenna and return it to the ground side of the transmitter&#x27;s feedline, so it is preferably located directly under the antenna. In receivers and low efficiency / low power transmitters, the ground connection can be as simple as one or several metal rods or stakes driven into the soil, or an electrical connection to a building&#x27;s metal water piping which extends into the earth. However, in transmitting antennas the ground system carries the full output current of the transmitter, so the resistance of an inadequate ground contact can be a major loss of transmitter power.

Medium to high power transmitters usually have an extensive ground system consisting of bare copper cables buried in the earth under the antenna, to lower resistance.
Since for the omnidirectional antennas used on these bands the Earth currents travel radially toward the ground point from all directions, the grounding system usually consists of a radial pattern of buried cables extending outward under the antenna in all directions, connected together to the ground side of the transmitter&#x27;s feedline at a terminal next to the base of the antenna called a radial ground system.
The transmitter power lost in the ground resistance, and so the efficiency of the antenna, depends on the soil conductivity. This varies widely; marshy ground or ponds, particularly salt water, provide the lowest resistance ground, while dry rocky or sandy soil are the highest. The power loss per square meter in the ground is proportional to the square of the transmitter current density flowing in the earth. The current density, and power dissipated, increases the closer one gets to the ground terminal at the base of the antenna, so the radial ground system can be thought of as providing a higher conductivity medium, copper, for the ground current to flow through, in the parts of the ground carrying high current density, to reduce power losses.

=== Design ===
A standard ground system widely used for mast radiator broadcasting antennas operating in the MF and LF bands consists of 120 equally-spaced, buried, radial ground wires extending out one quarter of a wavelength (formula_1, or 90 electrical degrees) from the antenna base.
AWG 8 to AWG 10 soft-drawn copper wire is typically used, buried 4–10 inches deep. For AM broadcast band antennas this requires a circular land area extending from the mast . This is usually planted with grass, which is kept mowed short, as tall grass can increase power loss in certain circumstances. If the land area available is too limited for such long radials, they can in many cases be adequately replaced by a greater number of shorter radials, or a smaller number of longer radials.

In transmitting antennas a second cause of power wastage is dielectric power losses of the electric field (displacement current) of the antenna passing through the earth to reach the ground wires. For antennas near a half-wavelength high (180 electrical degrees) the antenna has a voltage maximum (antinode) near its base, which results in strong electric fields in the earth above the ground wires near the mast where the displacement current enters the ground. To reduce this loss these antennas often use a conductive copper ground screen under the antenna connected to the buried ground wires, either lying on the ground or elevated a few feet, to shield the ground from the electric field.

In a few cases where rocky or sandy soil has too high a resistance for a buried ground, a counterpoise is used. This is a radial network of wires similar to that in a buried ground system, but lying on the surface or suspended a few feet above the ground. It acts as a capacitor plate, capacitively coupling the feedline to conductive layers of the soil.

=== Electrically short antennas ===
At lower frequencies the resistance of the ground system is a more critical factor because of the small radiation resistance of the antenna. In the LF and VLF bands, construction height limitations require that electrically short antennas be used, shorter than the fundamental resonant length of one quarter of a wavelength (formula_1). A quarter wave monopole has a radiation resistance of around 25~36 ohms, but below formula_1 the resistance decreases with the square of the ratio of height to wavelength. The power fed to an antenna is split between the radiation resistance, which represents power emitted as radio waves, the desired function of the antenna, and the ohmic resistance of the ground system, which results in power wasted as heat. As the wavelength gets longer in relation to antenna height, the radiation resistance of the antenna decreases so the ground resistance constitutes a larger proportion of the input resistance of the antenna and consumes more of the transmitter power. Antennas in the VLF band often have a resistance of less than 1 ohm, and even with extremely low resistance ground systems 50% to 90% of the transmitter power may be wasted in the ground system.

== Lightning protection systems ==
Lightning protection systems are designed to mitigate the effects of lightning through connection to extensive grounding systems that provide a large surface area connection to earth. The large area is required to dissipate the high current of a lightning strike without damaging the system conductors by excess heat. Since lightning strikes are pulses of energy with very high frequency components, grounding systems for lightning protection tend to use short straight runs of conductors to reduce the self-inductance and skin effect.

== Ground (earth) mat ==
In an electrical substation a ground (earth) mat is a mesh of conductive material installed at places where a person would stand to operate a switch or other apparatus; it is bonded to the local supporting metal structure and to the handle of the switchgear, so that the operator will not be exposed to a high differential voltage due to a fault in the substation.

In the vicinity of electrostatic sensitive devices, a ground (earth) mat or grounding (earthing) mat is used to ground static electricity generated by people and moving equipment. There are two types used in static control: Static Dissipative Mats, and Conductive Mats.

A static dissipative mat that rests on a conductive surface (commonly the case in military facilities) are typically made of 3 layers (3-ply) with static dissipative vinyl layers surrounding a conductive substrate which is electrically attached to ground (earth). For commercial uses, static dissipative rubber mats are traditionally used that are made of 2 layers (2-ply) with a tough solder resistant top static dissipative layer that makes them last longer than the vinyl mats, and a conductive rubber bottom. Conductive mats are made of carbon and used only on floors for the purpose of drawing static electricity to ground as quickly as possible. Normally conductive mats are made with cushioning for standing and are referred to as &quot;anti-fatigue&quot; mats.

For a static dissipative mat to be reliably grounded it must be attached to a path to ground. Normally, both the mat and the wrist strap are connected to ground by using a common point ground system (CPGS).

In computer repair shops and electronics manufacturing, workers must be grounded before working on devices sensitive to voltages capable of being generated by humans. For that reason static dissipative mats can be and are also used on production assembly floors as &quot;floor runner&quot; along the assembly line to draw static generated by people walking up and down.

== Isolation ==
Isolation is a mechanism that defeats grounding. It is frequently used with low-power consumer devices, and when engineers, hobbyists, or repairmen are working on circuits that would normally be operated using the power line voltage. Isolation can be accomplished by simply placing a &quot;1:1 wire ratio&quot; transformer with an equal number of turns between the device and the regular power service, but applies to any type of transformer using two or more coils electrically insulated from each other.

For an isolated device, touching a single powered conductor does not cause a severe shock, because there is no path back to the other conductor through the ground. However, shocks and electrocution may still occur if both poles of the transformer are contacted by bare skin. Previously it was suggested that repairmen &quot;work with one hand behind their back&quot; to avoid touching two parts of the device under test at the same time, thereby preventing a current from crossing through the chest and interrupting cardiac rhythms or causing cardiac arrest.

Generally every AC power line transformer acts as an isolation transformer, and every step up or down has the potential to form an isolated circuit. However, this isolation would prevent failed devices from blowing fuses when shorted to their ground conductor. The isolation that could be created by each transformer is defeated by always having one leg of the transformers grounded, on both sides of the input and output transformer coils. Power lines also typically ground one specific wire at every pole, to ensure current equalization from pole to pole if a short to ground is occurring.

In the past, grounded appliances have been designed with internal isolation to a degree that allowed the simple disconnection of ground by cheater plugs without apparent problem (a dangerous practice, since the safety of the resulting floating equipment relies on the insulation in its power transformer). Modern appliances however often include power entry modules which are designed with deliberate capacitive coupling between the AC power lines and chassis, to suppress electromagnetic interference. This results in a significant leakage current from the power lines to ground. If the ground is disconnected by a cheater plug or by accident, the resulting leakage current can cause mild shocks, even without any fault in the equipment. Even small leakage currents are a significant concern in medical settings, as the accidental disconnection of ground can introduce these currents into sensitive parts of the human body. As a result, medical power supplies are designed to have low capacitance.

Class II appliances and power supplies (such as cell phone chargers) do not provide any ground connection, and are designed to isolate the output from input. Safety is ensured by double-insulation, so that two failures of insulation are required to cause a shock.

<text>In telecommunications, ground constants are the electrical parameters of earth: electrical conductivity, σ, electrical permittivity, ε, and magnetic permeability, μ.

The values of these parameters vary with the local chemical composition and density of the Earth. For a propagating electromagnetic wave, such as a surface wave propagating along the surface of the Earth, these parameters vary with frequency and direction.

<text>In electrical engineering, a ground plane is an electrically conductive surface, usually connected to electrical ground. Ground planes are typically made of copper or aluminum, and they are often located on the bottom of printed circuit boards (PCBs).

The term has two different meanings in separate areas of electrical engineering.
* In antenna theory, a ground plane is a conducting surface large in comparison to the wavelength, such as the Earth, which is connected to the transmitter&#x27;s ground wire and serves as a reflecting surface for radio waves.
* In printed circuit boards, a ground plane is a large area of copper foil on the board which is connected to the power supply ground terminal and serves as a return path for current from different components on the board.
==Radio antenna theory==
In Telecommunications, a ground plane is a flat or nearly flat horizontal conducting surface that serves as part of an antenna, to reflect the radio waves from the other antenna elements. In monopole antennas the ground plane is connected to one side of the antenna feedline, usually the shield conductor of a coaxial cable, and the other side is connected to the monopole element itself. Ground plane shape and size play major roles in determining its radiation characteristics including gain.

To function as a ground plane, the conducting surface must be at least a quarter of the wavelength of the radio waves in radius. In lower frequency antennas, such as the mast radiators used for broadcast antennas, the Earth itself (or a body of water such as a salt marsh or ocean) is used as a ground plane. For higher frequency antennas, in the VHF or UHF range, the ground plane can be smaller, and metal disks, screens and wires are used as ground planes. At upper VHF and UHF, the metal skin of a car or aircraft can serve as a ground plane for whip antennas projecting from it. In microstrip antennas and printed monopole antennas an area of copper foil on the opposite side of a printed circuit board serves as a ground plane. The ground plane does not need to be a continuous surface. In the &quot;ground plane antenna&quot; style whip antenna, the plane consists of several wires   long radiating from the base of a quarter-wave whip antenna.

The radio waves from an antenna element that reflect off a ground plane appear to come from a mirror image of the antenna located on the other side of the ground plane. In a monopole antenna, the radiation pattern of the monopole plus the virtual image antenna make it appear as a two-element center-fed dipole antenna. So a monopole mounted over an ideal ground plane has a radiation pattern identical to a dipole antenna. The feedline from the transmitter or receiver is connected between the bottom end of the monopole element and the ground plane. The ground plane must have good conductivity; any resistance in the ground plane is in series with the antenna and serves to dissipate power from the transmitter.

Antennas usually need ground planes as they serves as a stabilizing factor for the signal, ensuring that antennas have a consistent baseline from which to transmit and receive information. It also helps create a specific radiation pattern by reflecting radio waves, ensuring that the antenna radiates efficiently. There are also some cases that ground planes can improve the overall performance of the antenna by ensuring better signal propagation.

== Printed circuit boards ==
A &quot;ground plane&quot; on a printed circuit board (PCB) is a large area or layer of copper foil connected to the circuit&#x27;s ground point, usually one terminal of the power supply. It serves as the return path for current from many different components.

A ground plane is often made as large as possible, covering most of the area of the PCB which is not occupied by circuit traces. In multilayer PCBs, it is often a separate layer covering the entire board. This serves to make circuit layout easier, allowing the designer to ground any component without having to run additional traces; component leads needing grounding are routed directly through a hole in the board to the ground plane on another layer. The large area of copper also conducts the large return currents from many components without significant voltage drops, ensuring that the ground connection of all the components are at the same reference potential.

In digital and radio frequency PCBs, the major reason for using large ground planes is to reduce electrical noise and interference through ground loops and to prevent crosstalk between adjacent circuit traces. When digital circuits switch state, large current pulses flow from the active devices (transistors or integrated circuits) through the ground circuit. If the power supply and ground traces have significant impedance, the voltage drop across them may create noise voltage pulses that disturb other parts of the circuit (ground bounce). The large conducting area of the ground plane has much lower impedance than a circuit trace, so the current pulses cause less disturbance.

In addition, a ground plane under printed circuit traces can reduce crosstalk between adjacent traces. When two traces run parallel, an electrical signal in one can be coupled into the other through electromagnetic induction by magnetic field lines from one linking the other; this is called crosstalk. When a ground plane layer is present underneath, it forms a transmission line with the trace. The oppositely-directed return currents flow through the ground plane directly beneath the trace. This confines most of the electromagnetic fields to the area near the trace and consequently reduces crosstalk.

A power plane is often used in addition to a ground plane in a multilayer circuit board, to distribute DC power to the active devices. The two facing areas of copper create a large parallel plate decoupling capacitor that prevents noise from being coupled from one circuit to another through the power supply.

Ground planes are sometimes split and then connected by a thin trace. This allows the separation of analog and digital sections of a board or the inputs and outputs of amplifiers. The thin trace has low enough impedance to keep the two sides very close to the same potential while keeping the ground currents of one side from coupling into the other side, causing ground loop.

<text>Ground wave is a mode of radio propagation that consists of currents traveling through the earth. Ground waves propagate parallel to and adjacent to the surface of the Earth, and are capable of covering long distances by diffracting around the Earth&#x27;s curvature. This radiation is also known as the Norton surface wave, or more properly the Norton ground wave, because ground waves in radio propagation are not confined to the surface. Groundwave contrasts with line-of-sight propagation that requires no medium, and skywave via the ionosphere. 

Ground wave is important for radio signals below 30 MHz, but is generally insignificant at higher frequencies where line-of-sight propagation dominates. AM and longwave broadcasting, navigation systems such as LORAN, low-frequency time signals, non-directional beacons, and short-range HF communications all make use of it. Range depends on frequency and ground conductivity, with lower frequencies and higher ground conductivity permitting longer distances. 
==Overview==

Lower frequency radio waves, below 3 MHz, travel efficiently as ground waves. As losses increase with frequency, high frequency transmissions between 3 and 30 MHz have more modest groundwave range and groundwave is unimportant above 30 MHz. Surface conductivity affects the propagation of ground waves, with highly conductive surfaces such as sea water providing the best propagation, and dry ground and ice performing the worst.

As the distance increases, ground waves spread out according to the inverse-square law. The imperfect conductivity of the ground tilts the waves forward, dissipating energy into the ground. The long wavelengths of these signals allow them to diffract over the horizon, but this leads to further losses. Signal strength tends to fall exponentially with distance once the Earth&#x27;s curvature is significant. Above about 10 kHz, atmospheric refraction helps bend waves downward. Only vertically polarized waves travel well; horizontally polarized signals are heavily attenuated.

Groundwave signals are relatively immune to fading but changes in the ground can cause variation in signal strength. Attenuation over land is lowest in the winter in temperate climates and higher over water when seas are rough. Hills, mountains, urban areas, and forests can create areas of reduced signal strength. The penetration depth of ground waves varies, reaching tens of meters at medium frequencies over dry ground and even more at lower frequencies. Propagation predictions thus require knowing the electrical properties of subsurface layers, which are best measured from groundwave attenuation.

==Applications==

Most low-frequency radio communication is via groundwave propagation. Groundwave is also the primary mode for medium frequencies during the day when skywave is absent, and can be useful at high frequencies at short ranges. Uses include navigation signals, low-frequency time signals, longwave radio, and AM radio. The increased effectiveness of groundwave at lower frequencies gives AM radio stations more coverage at the low end of the band. High frequency over-the-horizon radar may use groundwave at moderate ranges but skywave at longer distances. Military communications in the very low and low frequency range uses ground wave, especially to reach ships and submarines, as groundwaves at these long wavelengths penetrate well below the sea surface.

In the development of radio, ground waves were used extensively. Early commercial and professional radio services relied exclusively on long wave, low frequencies and ground-wave propagation. To prevent interference with these services, amateur and experimental transmitters were restricted to the high frequencies (HF), felt to be useless since their ground-wave range was limited. Upon discovery of the other propagation modes possible at medium wave and short wave frequencies, the advantages of HF for commercial and military purposes became apparent. Amateur experimentation was then confined to only authorized frequencies in the range.

== Modeling ==
In the 1930s, Alfred Norton was the first author to accurately describe groundwave mathematically, deriving an equation for field strength over a flat earth. Van der Pol and Bremmer published calculations for a spherical Earth from 1937 to 1939. Later work focused on paths with variable conductivity, the effects of terrain and objects on the ground, and computer modeling.

==Related terms==

Mediumwave and shortwave reflect off the ionosphere at night, which is known as skywave. During daylight hours, the lower D layer of the ionosphere forms and absorbs lower frequency energy. This prevents skywave propagation from being very effective on mediumwave frequencies in daylight hours. At night, when the D layer dissipates, mediumwave transmissions travel better by skywave. Ground waves &quot;do not&quot; include ionospheric and tropospheric waves

<text>In signal processing, group delay and phase delay are functions that describe in different ways the delay times experienced by a signal’s various sinusoidal frequency components as they pass through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system (such as a microphone, coaxial cable, amplifier, loudspeaker, communications system, ethernet cable, digital filter, or analog filter).

Unfortunately, these delays are sometimes frequency dependent, which means that different sinusoid frequency components experience different time delays. As a result, the signal&#x27;s waveform experiences distortion as it passes through the system. This distortion can cause problems such as poor fidelity in analog video and analog audio, or a high bit-error rate in a digital bit stream.

== Background ==
=== Frequency components of a signal ===

Fourier analysis reveals how signals in time can alternatively be expressed as the sum of sinusoidal frequency components, each based on the trigonometric function formula_1 with a fixed amplitude and phase and no beginning and no end.

Linear time-invariant systems process each sinusoidal component independently; the property of linearity means they satisfy the superposition principle.

== Introduction ==
The group delay and phase delay properties of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system are functions of frequency, giving the time from when a frequency component of a time varying physical quantity—for example a voltage signal—appears at the LTI system input, to the time when a copy of that same frequency component—perhaps of a different physical phenomenon—appears at the LTI system output.

A varying phase response as a function of frequency, from which group delay and phase delay can be calculated, typically occurs in devices such as microphones, amplifiers, loudspeakers, magnetic recorders, headphones, coaxial cables, and antialiasing filters. All frequency components of a signal are delayed when passed through such devices, or when propagating through space or a medium, such as air or water.

While a phase response describes phase shift in angular units (such as degrees or radians), the phase delay is in units of time and equals the negative of the phase shift at each frequency divided by the value of that frequency. Group delay is the negative derivative of phase shift with respect to frequency.

=== Phase delay ===
A linear time-invariant system or device has a phase response property and a phase delay property, where one can be calculated exactly from the other. Phase delay directly measures the device or system time delay of individual &quot;sinusoidal&quot; frequency components. If the phase delay function at any given frequency—within a frequency range of interest—has the same constant of proportionality between the phase at a selected frequency and the selected frequency itself, the system/device will have the ideal of a flat phase delay property, a.k.a. linear phase. Since phase delay is a function of frequency giving time delay, a departure from the flatness of its function graph can reveal time delay differences among the signal’s various sinusoidal frequency components, in which case those differences will contribute to signal distortion, which is manifested as the output signal waveform shape being different from that of the input signal.

The phase delay property in general does not give useful information if the device input is a modulated signal. For that, group delay must be used.

=== Group delay ===
The group delay is a convenient measure of the linearity of the phase with respect to frequency in a modulation system. For a modulation signal (passband signal), the information carried by the signal is carried exclusively in the wave envelope. Group delay therefore operates only with the frequency components derived from the envelope.

==== Basic modulation system ====

A device&#x27;s group delay can be exactly calculated from the device&#x27;s phase response, but not the other way around. The simplest use case for group delay is illustrated in Figure 1 which shows a conceptual modulation system, which is itself an LTI system with a baseband output that is ideally an accurate copy of the baseband signal input. This system as a whole is referred to here as the outer LTI system/device, which contains an inner (red block) LTI system/device. As is often the case for a radio system, the inner red LTI system in Fig 1 can represent two LTI systems in cascade, for example an amplifier driving a transmitting antenna at the sending end and the other an antenna and amplifier at the receiving end.

==== Amplitude Modulation ====
Amplitude modulation creates the passband signal by shifting the baseband frequency components to a much higher frequency range. Although the frequencies are different, the passband signal carries the same information as the baseband signal. The demodulator does the inverse, shifting the passband frequencies back down to the original baseband frequency range. Ideally, the output (baseband) signal is a time delayed version of the input (baseband) signal where the waveform shape of the output is identical to that of the input.

In Figure 1, the outer system phase delay is the meaningful performance metric. &quot;For amplitude modulation, the inner red LTI device group delay becomes the outer LTI device phase delay&quot;. If the inner red device group delay is completely flat in the frequency range of interest, the outer device will have the ideal of a phase delay that is also completely flat, where the contribution of distortion due to the outer LTI device&#x27;s phase response—determined entirely by the inner device&#x27;s possibly different phase response—is eliminated. In that case, the group delay of the inner red device and the phase delay of the outer device give the same time delay figure for the signal as a whole, from the baseband input to the baseband output. It is significant to note that it is possible for the inner (red) device to have a very non-flat phase delay (but flat group delay), while the outer device has the ideal of a perfectly flat phase delay. This is fortunate because in LTI device design, a flat group delay is easier to achieve than a flat phase delay.

==== Angle Modulation ====
In an angle-modulation system—such as with frequency modulation (FM) or phase modulation (PM)—the (FM or PM) passband signal applied to an LTI system input can be analyzed as two separate passband signals, an in-phase (I) amplitude modulation AM passband signal and a quadrature-phase (Q) amplitude modulation AM passband signal, where their sum exactly reconstructs the original angle-modulation (FM or PM) passband signal. While the (FM/PM) passband signal is not amplitude modulation, and therefore has no apparent outer envelope, the I and Q passband signals do indeed have separate amplitude modulation envelopes. (However, unlike with regular amplitude modulation, the I and Q envelopes do not resemble the wave shape of the baseband signals, even though 100 percent of the baseband signal is represented in a complex manner by their envelopes.) So, for each of the I and Q passband signals, a flat group delay ensures that neither the I pass band envelope nor the Q passband envelope will have wave shape distortion, so when the I passband signal and the Q passband signal are added back together, the sum is the original FM/PM passband signal, which will also be unaltered.

== Theory ==
According to LTI system theory (used in control theory and digital or analog signal processing), the output signal formula_2 of an LTI system can be determined by convolving the time-domain impulse response formula_3 of the LTI system with the input signal formula_4. expresses this relationship as:

: formula_5

where formula_6 denotes the convolution operation, formula_7 and formula_8 are the Laplace transforms of the input formula_4 and impulse response formula_3, respectively, is the complex frequency, and formula_11 is the inverse Laplace transform. formula_8 is called the transfer function of the LTI system and, like the impulse response formula_3, &quot;fully&quot; defines the input-output characteristics of the LTI system. This convolution can be evaluated by using the integral expression in the time domain, or (according to the rightmost expression) by using multiplication in the Laplace domain and then applying the inverse transform to return to time domain.

=== LTI system response to wave packet ===
Suppose that such a system is driven by a wave packet formed by a sinusoid multiplied by an amplitude envelope formula_14, so the input formula_4 can be expressed in the following form:

: formula_16

Also suppose that the envelope formula_17 is slowly changing relative to the sinusoid&#x27;s frequency formula_18. This condition can be expressed mathematically as:

: formula_19

Applying the earlier convolution equation would reveal that the output of such an LTI system is very well approximated as:

: formula_20

Here formula_21 is the group delay and formula_22 is the phase delay, and they are given by the expressions below (and potentially are functions of the angular frequency formula_18). The phase of the sinusoid, as indicated by the positions of the zero crossings, is delayed in time by an amount equal to the phase delay, formula_22. The envelope of the sinusoid is delayed in time by the group delay, formula_21.

=== Mathematical definition of group delay and phase delay ===
The group delay, formula_21, and phase delay, formula_22, are (potentially) frequency-dependent and can be computed from the unwrapped phase shift formula_28. The phase delay at each frequency equals the negative of the phase shift at that frequency divided by the value of that frequency:

: formula_29
The group delay at each frequency equals the negative of the &quot;slope&quot; (i.e. the derivative with respect to frequency) of the phase at that frequency:
: formula_30

In a linear phase system (with non-inverting gain), both formula_21 and formula_22 are constant (i.e., independent of formula_18) and equal, and their common value equals the overall delay of the system; and the unwrapped phase shift of the system (namely formula_34) is negative, with magnitude increasing linearly with frequency formula_18.

=== LTI system response to complex sinusoid ===
More generally, it can be shown that for an LTI system with transfer function formula_8 driven by a complex sinusoid of unit amplitude,

: formula_37

the output is

: formula_38

where the phase shift formula_39 is

: formula_40

=== 1st order low- or high-pass RC filter example ===
The phase of a 1st-order low-pass filter formed by a RC circuit with cutoff frequency formula_41 is:

formula_42

Similarly, the phase for a 1st-order RC high-pass filter is:

formula_43

Taking the negative derivative with respect to formula_44 for either this low-pass or high-pass filter yields the same group delay of:

formula_45

For frequencies significantly lower than the cutoff frequency, the phase response is approximately linear (arctan for small inputs can be approximated as a line), so the group delay simplifies to a constant value of:

formula_46

Similarly, right at the cutoff frequency, formula_47

As frequencies get even larger, the group delay decreases with the inverse square of the frequency and approaches zero as frequency approaches infinity.

=== Negative group delay ===

Filters will have &quot;negative&quot; group delay over frequency ranges where its phase response is positively-sloped. If a signal is band-limited within some maximum frequency B, then it is predictable to a small degree (within time periods smaller than ). A filter whose group delay is negative over that signal&#x27;s entire frequency range is able to use the signal&#x27;s predictability to provide an illusion of a non-causal time advance. However, if the signal contains an unpredictable event (such as an abrupt change which makes the signal&#x27;s spectrum exceed its band-limit), then the illusion breaks down. Circuits with negative group delay (e.g., Figure 2) are possible, though causality is not violated.

Negative group delay filters can be made in both digital and analog domains. Applications include compensating for the inherent delay of low-pass filters, to create &quot;zero phase&quot; filters, which can be used to quickly detect changes in the trends of sensor data or stock prices.

== Group delay in audio ==
Group delay has some importance in the audio field and especially in the sound reproduction field. Many components of an audio reproduction chain, notably loudspeakers and multiway loudspeaker crossover networks, introduce group delay in the audio signal. It is therefore important to know the threshold of audibility of group delay with respect to frequency, especially if the audio chain is supposed to provide high fidelity reproduction. The best thresholds of audibility table has been provided by Blauert and Laws.

Flanagan, Moore and Stone conclude that at 1, 2 and 4 kHz, a group delay of about 1.6 ms is audible with headphones in a non-reverberant condition. Other experimental results suggest that when the group delay in the frequency range from 300 Hz to 1 kHz is below 1.0 ms, it is inaudible.

The waveform of any signal can be reproduced exactly by a system that has a flat frequency response and group delay over the bandwidth of the signal. Leach introduced the concept of differential time-delay distortion, defined as the difference between the phase delay and the group delay:

: formula_48.

An ideal system should exhibit zero or negligible differential time-delay distortion.

It is possible to use digital signal processing techniques to correct the group delay distortion that arises due to the use of crossover networks in multi-way loudspeaker systems. This involves considerable computational modeling of loudspeaker systems in order to successfully apply delay equalization, using the Parks-McClellan FIR equiripple filter design algorithm.

== Group delay in optics ==
Group delay is important in physics, and in particular in optics.

In an optical fiber, group delay is the transit time required for optical power, traveling at a given mode&#x27;s group velocity, to travel a given distance. For optical fiber dispersion measurement purposes, the quantity of interest is group delay per unit length, which is the reciprocal of the group velocity of a particular mode. The measured group delay of a signal through an optical fiber exhibits a wavelength dependence due to the various dispersion mechanisms present in the fiber.

It is often desirable for the group delay to be constant across all frequencies; otherwise there is temporal smearing of the signal. Because group delay is formula_49, it therefore follows that a constant group delay can be achieved if the transfer function of the device or medium has a linear phase response (i.e., formula_50 where the group delay formula_51 is a constant). The degree of nonlinearity of the phase indicates the deviation of the group delay from a constant value.

The differential group delay is the difference in propagation time between the two eigenmodes &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; polarizations. Consider two eigenmodes that are the 0° and 90° linear polarization states. If the state of polarization of the input signal is the linear state at 45° between the two eigenmodes, the input signal is divided equally into the two eigenmodes. The power of the transmitted signal &quot;E&quot;&quot;T&quot;,total is the combination of the transmitted signals of both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; modes.

: formula_52

The differential group delay &quot;D&quot;&quot;t&quot; is defined as the difference in propagation time between the eigenmodes: &quot;D&quot;&quot;t&quot; = |&quot;t&quot;&quot;t&quot;,&quot;x&quot; − &quot;t&quot;&quot;t&quot;,&quot;y&quot;|.

==True time delay==
A transmitting apparatus is said to have &quot;true time delay&quot; (TTD) if the time delay is independent of the frequency of the electrical signal. TTD allows for a wide instantaneous signal bandwidth with virtually no signal distortion such as pulse broadening during pulsed operation.

TTD is an important characteristic of lossless and low-loss, dispersion free, transmission lines. reveals that signals propagate through them at a speed of formula_53 for a distributed inductance and capacitance . Hence, any signal&#x27;s propagation delay through the line simply equals the length of the line divided by this speed.

== Group delay from transfer function polynomials ==
If a transfer function or Sij of a scattering parameter, is in a polynomial Laplace transform form, then the mathematical definition for group delay above may be solved analytically in closed form. A polynomial transfer function formula_54 may be taken along the formula_55 axis and defined as formula_56. formula_57 may be determined from formula_56, and then the group delay may be determined by solving for formula_59.

to determine formula_57 from formula_56, use the definition of formula_62. Given that formula_63 is always real, and formula_64 is always imaginary, formula_57 may be redefined as formula_66 where &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot; refer to the polynomials that contain only the even or odd order coefficients respectively. The formula_67 in the numerator merely converts the imaginary formula_68 numerator to a real value, since formula_68 by itself is purely imaginary.

formula_70

The above expressions contain four terms to calculate:

formula_71

The equations above may be used to determine the group delay of polynomial formula_54 in closed form, shown below after the equations have been reduced to a simplified form.

formula_73

=== Polynomial ratio ===
A polynomial ratio of the form formula_74, such as that typically found in the definition of filter designs, may have the group delay determined by taking advantage of the phase relation, formula_75.

formula_76

=== Simple filter example ===
A four pole Legendre filter transfer function used in the Legendre filter example is shown below.

formula_77

The numerator group delay by inspection is zero, so only the denominator group delay need be determined.

formula_78

Evaluating at formula_79 = 1 rad/sec:

formula_80

formula_81

The group delay calculation procedure and results may be confirmed to be correct by comparing them to the results derived from the digital derivative of the phase angle, formula_57, using a small delta formula_83 of +/-1.e-04 rad/sec.

formula_84

Since the group delay calculated by the digital derivative using a small delta is within 7 digits of accuracy when compared to the precise analytical calculation, the group delay calculation procedure and results are confirmed to be correct.

== Deviation from Linear Phase ==
Deviation from Linear Phase, formula_85, sometimes referred to as just, &quot;phase deviation&quot;, is the difference between the phase response, formula_57, and the linear portion of the phase response formula_87, and is a useful measurement to determine the linearity of formula_57.

A convenient means to measure formula_85 is to take the simple linear regression of formula_57 sampled over a frequency range of interest, and subtract it from the actual formula_57. The formula_85 of an ideal linear phase response would be expected to have a value of 0 across the frequency range of interest (such as the pass band of a filter), while the formula_85 of a real-world approximately linear phase response may deviate from 0 by a small finite amount across the frequency range of interest.

=== Advantage over group delay ===
An advantage of measuring or calculating formula_85 over measuring or calculating group delay, formula_95, is formula_85 always converges to 0 as the phase becomes linear, whereas formula_95 converges on a finite quantity that may not be known ahead of time. Given this, a linear phase optimizing function may more easily be executed with a formula_98 goal than with a formula_99 goal when the value for formula_100 is not necessarily already known.

<text>A guided ray (also bound ray or trapped ray) is a ray of light in a multi-mode optical fiber, which is confined by the core.

For step index fiber, light entering the fiber will be guided if it falls within the acceptance cone of the fiber, that is if it makes an angle with the fiber axis that is less than the acceptance angle,

:formula_1 ,

where
:&quot;θ&quot; is the angle the ray makes with the fiber axis, &quot;before&quot; entering the fiber,
:&quot;n&quot;0 is the refractive index along the central axis (core) of the fiber, and
:&quot;n&quot;c is the refractive index of the cladding.

The quantity formula_2 is the numerical aperture of the fiber. The quantity formula_3 is sometimes called the &quot;total acceptance angle&quot; of the fiber.

This result can be derived from Snell&#x27;s law by considering the critical angle. Light that enters the core with an angle below the acceptance angle strikes the core-cladding boundary at an angle above the critical angle, and experiences total internal reflection. This repeats on every bounce within the fiber core, and so the light is confined to the core. The confinement of light by the fiber can also be described in terms of bound modes or guided modes. This treatment is necessary when considering single-mode fiber, since the ray model does not accurately describe the propagation of light in this type of fiber.

<text>In computer science and telecommunications, Hamming codes are a family of linear error-correcting codes. Hamming codes can detect one-bit and two-bit errors, or correct one-bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors. By contrast, the simple parity code cannot correct errors, and can detect only an odd number of bits in error. Hamming codes are perfect codes, that is, they achieve the highest possible rate for codes with their block length and minimum distance of three.
Richard W. Hamming invented Hamming codes in 1950 as a way of automatically correcting errors introduced by punched card readers. In his original paper, Hamming elaborated his general idea, but specifically focused on the Hamming(7,4) code which adds three parity bits to four bits of data.

In mathematical terms, Hamming codes are a class of binary linear code. For each integer there is a code-word with block length and message length . Hence the rate of Hamming codes is , which is the highest possible for codes with minimum distance of three (i.e., the minimal number of bit changes needed to go from any code word to any other code word is three) and block length . The parity-check matrix of a Hamming code is constructed by listing all columns of length that are non-zero, which means that the dual code of the Hamming code is the shortened Hadamard code, also known as a Simplex code. The parity-check matrix has the property that any two columns are pairwise linearly independent.

Due to the limited redundancy that Hamming codes add to the data, they can only detect and correct errors when the error rate is low. This is the case in computer memory (usually RAM), where bit errors are extremely rare and Hamming codes are widely used, and a RAM with this correction system is an ECC RAM (ECC memory). In this context, an extended Hamming code having one extra parity bit is often used. Extended Hamming codes achieve a Hamming distance of four, which allows the decoder to distinguish between when at most one one-bit error occurs and when any two-bit errors occur. In this sense, extended Hamming codes are single-error correcting and double-error detecting, abbreviated as SECDED.

== History ==
Richard Hamming, the inventor of Hamming codes, worked at Bell Labs in the late 1940s on the Bell Model V computer, an electromechanical relay-based machine with cycle times in seconds. Input was fed in on punched paper tape, seven-eighths of an inch wide, which had up to six holes per row. During weekdays, when errors in the relays were detected, the machine would stop and flash lights so that the operators could correct the problem. During after-hours periods and on weekends, when there were no operators, the machine simply moved on to the next job.

Hamming worked on weekends, and grew increasingly frustrated with having to restart his programs from scratch due to detected errors. In a taped interview, Hamming said, &quot;And so I said, &#x27;Damn it, if the machine can detect an error, why can&#x27;t it locate the position of the error and correct it?&#x27;&quot;. Over the next few years, he worked on the problem of error-correction, developing an increasingly powerful array of algorithms. In 1950, he published what is now known as Hamming code, which remains in use today in applications such as ECC memory.

=== Codes predating Hamming ===
A number of simple error-detecting codes were used before Hamming codes, but none were as effective as Hamming codes in the same overhead of space.

==== Parity ====
Parity adds a single bit that indicates whether the number of ones (bit-positions with values of one) in the preceding data was even or odd. If an odd number of bits is changed in transmission, the message will change parity and the error can be detected at this point; however, the bit that changed may have been the parity bit itself. The most common convention is that a parity value of one indicates that there is an odd number of ones in the data, and a parity value of zero indicates that there is an even number of ones. If the number of bits changed is even, the check bit will be valid and the error will not be detected.

Moreover, parity does not indicate which bit contained the error, even when it can detect it. The data must be discarded entirely and re-transmitted from scratch. On a noisy transmission medium, a successful transmission could take a long time or may never occur. However, while the quality of parity checking is poor, since it uses only a single bit, this method results in the least overhead.

====Two-out-of-five code====
A two-out-of-five code is an encoding scheme which uses five bits consisting of exactly three 0s and two 1s. This provides formula_1 possible combinations, enough to represent the digits 0–9. This scheme can detect all single bit-errors, all odd numbered bit-errors and some even numbered bit-errors (for example the flipping of both 1-bits). However it still cannot correct any of these errors.

====Repetition====
Another code in use at the time repeated every data bit multiple times in order to ensure that it was sent correctly. For instance, if the data bit to be sent is a 1, an &quot;repetition code&quot; will send 111. If the three bits received are not identical, an error occurred during transmission. If the channel is clean enough, most of the time only one bit will change in each triple. Therefore, 001, 010, and 100 each correspond to a 0 bit, while 110, 101, and 011 correspond to a 1 bit, with the greater quantity of digits that are the same (&#x27;0&#x27; or a &#x27;1&#x27;) indicating what the data bit should be. A code with this ability to reconstruct the original message in the presence of errors is known as an &quot;error-correcting&quot; code. This triple repetition code is a Hamming code with since there are two parity bits, and data bit.

Such codes cannot correctly repair all errors, however. In our example, if the channel flips two bits and the receiver gets 001, the system will detect the error, but conclude that the original bit is 0, which is incorrect. If we increase the size of the bit string to four, we can detect all two-bit errors but cannot correct them (the quantity of parity bits is even); at five bits, we can both detect and correct all two-bit errors, but not all three-bit errors.

Moreover, increasing the size of the parity bit string is inefficient, reducing throughput by three times in our original case, and the efficiency drops drastically as we increase the number of times each bit is duplicated in order to detect and correct more errors.

==Description==
If more error-correcting bits are included with a message, and if those bits can be arranged such that different incorrect bits produce different error results, then bad bits could be identified. In a seven-bit message, there are seven possible single bit errors, so three error control bits could potentially specify not only that an error occurred but also which bit caused the error.

Hamming studied the existing coding schemes, including two-of-five, and generalized their concepts. To start with, he developed a to describe the system, including the number of data bits and error-correction bits in a block. For instance, parity includes a single bit for any data word, so assuming ASCII words with seven bits, Hamming described this as an &quot;(8,7)&quot; code, with eight bits in total, of which seven are data. The repetition example would be &quot;(3,1)&quot;, following the same logic. The code rate is the second number divided by the first, for our repetition example, 1/3.

Hamming also noticed the problems with flipping two or more bits, and described this as the &quot;distance&quot; (it is now called the &quot;Hamming distance&quot;, after him). Parity has a distance of 2, so one bit flip can be detected but not corrected, and any two bit flips will be invisible. The (3,1) repetition has a distance of 3, as three bits need to be flipped in the same triple to obtain another code word with no visible errors. It can correct one-bit errors or it can detect - but not correct - two-bit errors. A (4,1) repetition (each bit is repeated four times) has a distance of 4, so flipping three bits can be detected, but not corrected. When three bits flip in the same group there can be situations where attempting to correct will produce the wrong code word. In general, a code with distance &quot;k&quot; can detect but not correct errors.

Hamming was interested in two problems at once: increasing the distance as much as possible, while at the same time increasing the code rate as much as possible. During the 1940s he developed several encoding schemes that were dramatic improvements on existing codes. The key to all of his systems was to have the parity bits overlap, such that they managed to check each other as well as the data.

===General algorithm===
The following general algorithm generates a single-error correcting (SEC) code for any number of bits. The main idea is to choose the error-correcting bits such that the index-XOR (the XOR of all the bit positions containing a 1) is 0. We use positions 1, 10, 100, etc. (in binary) as the error-correcting bits, which guarantees it is possible to set the error-correcting bits so that the index-XOR of the whole message is 0. If the receiver receives a string with index-XOR 0, they can conclude there were no corruptions, and otherwise, the index-XOR indicates the index of the corrupted bit.

An algorithm can be deduced from the following description:

# Number the bits starting from 1: bit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc.
# Write the bit numbers in binary: 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, etc.
# All bit positions that are powers of two (have a single 1 bit in the binary form of their position) are parity bits: 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. (1, 10, 100, 1000)
# All other bit positions, with two or more 1 bits in the binary form of their position, are data bits.
# Each data bit is included in a unique set of 2 or more parity bits, as determined by the binary form of its bit position.
## Parity bit 1 covers all bit positions which have the least significant bit set: bit 1 (the parity bit itself), 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.
## Parity bit 2 covers all bit positions which have the second least significant bit set: bits 2–3, 6–7, 10–11, etc.
## Parity bit 4 covers all bit positions which have the third least significant bit set: bits 4–7, 12–15, 20–23, etc.
## Parity bit 8 covers all bit positions which have the fourth least significant bit set: bits 8–15, 24–31, 40–47, etc.
## In general each parity bit covers all bits where the bitwise AND of the parity position and the bit position is non-zero.

If a byte of data to be encoded is 10011010, then the data word (using _ to represent the parity bits) would be __1_001_1010, and the code word is 011100101010.

The choice of the parity, even or odd, is irrelevant but the same choice must be used for both encoding and decoding.

This general rule can be shown visually:

Shown are only 20 encoded bits (5 parity, 15 data) but the pattern continues indefinitely. The key thing about Hamming codes that can be seen from visual inspection is that any given bit is included in a unique set of parity bits. To check for errors, check all of the parity bits. The pattern of errors, called the error syndrome, identifies the bit in error. If all parity bits are correct, there is no error. Otherwise, the sum of the positions of the erroneous parity bits identifies the erroneous bit. For example, if the parity bits in positions 1, 2 and 8 indicate an error, then bit 1+2+8=11 is in error. If only one parity bit indicates an error, the parity bit itself is in error.

With parity bits, bits from 1 up to formula_2 can be covered. After discounting the parity bits, formula_3 bits remain for use as data. As varies, we get all the possible Hamming codes:

== Hamming codes with additional parity (SECDED) ==
Hamming codes have a minimum distance of 3, which means that the decoder can detect and correct a single error, but it cannot distinguish a double bit error of some codeword from a single bit error of a different codeword. Thus, some double-bit errors will be incorrectly decoded as if they were single bit errors and therefore go undetected, unless no correction is attempted.

To remedy this shortcoming, Hamming codes can be extended by an extra parity bit. This way, it is possible to increase the minimum distance of the Hamming code to 4, which allows the decoder to distinguish between single bit errors and two-bit errors. Thus the decoder can detect and correct a single error and at the same time detect (but not correct) a double error.

If the decoder does not attempt to correct errors, it can reliably detect triple bit errors. If the decoder does correct errors, some triple errors will be mistaken for single errors and &quot;corrected&quot; to the wrong value. Error correction is therefore a trade-off between certainty (the ability to reliably detect triple bit errors) and resiliency (the ability to keep functioning in the face of single bit errors).

This extended Hamming code was popular in computer memory systems, starting with IBM 7030 Stretch in 1961, where it is known as &quot;SECDED&quot; (or SEC-DED, abbreviated from &quot;single error correction, double error detection&quot;). Server computers in 21st century, while typically keeping the SECDED level of protection, no longer use Hamming&#x27;s method, relying instead on the designs with longer codewords (128 to 256 bits of data) and modified balanced parity-check trees. The (72,64) Hamming code is still popular in some hardware designs, including Xilinx FPGA families.

==[7,4] Hamming code==

In 1950, Hamming introduced the [7,4] Hamming code. It encodes four data bits into seven bits by adding three parity bits. As explained earlier, it can either detect and correct single-bit errors or it can detect (but not correct) both single and double-bit errors.

With the addition of an overall parity bit, it becomes the [8,4] extended Hamming code and can both detect and correct single-bit errors and detect (but not correct) double-bit errors.

===Construction of G and H===
The matrix 
formula_4 is called a (canonical) generator matrix of a linear (&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) code,

and formula_5 is called a parity-check matrix.

This is the construction of G and H in standard (or systematic) form. Regardless of form, G and H for linear block codes must satisfy

formula_6, an all-zeros matrix.

Since [7, 4, 3] = [&quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;d&quot;] = [2&quot;m&quot; − 1, 2&quot;m&quot; − 1 − &quot;m&quot;, 3]. The parity-check matrix H of a Hamming code is constructed by listing all columns of length &quot;m&quot; that are pair-wise independent.

Thus H is a matrix whose left side is all of the nonzero &quot;n&quot;-tuples where order of the &quot;n&quot;-tuples in the columns of matrix does not matter. The right hand side is just the (&quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot;)-identity matrix.

So G can be obtained from H by taking the transpose of the left hand side of H with the identity &quot;k&quot;-identity matrix on the left hand side of G.

The code generator matrix formula_7 and the parity-check matrix formula_8 are:

formula_9

and

formula_10

Finally, these matrices can be mutated into equivalent non-systematic codes by the following operations:

* Column permutations (swapping columns)
* Elementary row operations (replacing a row with a linear combination of rows)

===Encoding===
;Example

From the above matrix we have 2k = 24 = 16 codewords.
Let formula_11 be a row vector of binary data bits, formula_12. The codeword formula_13 for any of the 16 possible data vectors formula_14 is given by the standard matrix product formula_15 where the summing operation is done modulo-2.

For example, let formula_16. Using the generator matrix formula_17 from above, we have (after applying modulo 2, to the sum),

formula_18

===[8,4] Hamming code with an additional parity bit===
The [7,4] Hamming code can easily be extended to an [8,4] code by adding an extra parity bit on top of the (7,4) encoded word (see Hamming(7,4)).
This can be summed up with the revised matrices:

:formula_19

and

:formula_20


Note that H is not in standard form. To obtain G, elementary row operations can be used to obtain an equivalent matrix to H in systematic form:

:formula_21

For example, the first row in this matrix is the sum of the second and third rows of H in non-systematic form. Using the systematic construction for Hamming codes from above, the matrix A is apparent and the systematic form of G is written as

:formula_22

The non-systematic form of G can be row reduced (using elementary row operations) to match this matrix.

The addition of the fourth row effectively computes the sum of all the codeword bits (data and parity) as the fourth parity bit.

For example, 1011 is encoded (using the non-systematic form of G at the start of this section) into 01100110 where blue digits are data; red digits are parity bits from the [7,4] Hamming code; and the green digit is the parity bit added by the [8,4] code.
The green digit makes the parity of the [7,4] codewords even.

Finally, it can be shown that the minimum distance has increased from 3, in the [7,4] code, to 4 in the [8,4] code. Therefore, the code can be defined as [8,4] Hamming code. 

To decode the [8,4] Hamming code, first check the parity bit. If the parity bit indicates an error, single error correction (the [7,4] Hamming code) will indicate the error location, with &quot;no error&quot; indicating the parity bit. If the parity bit is correct, then single error correction will indicate the (bitwise) exclusive-or of two error locations. If the locations are equal (&quot;no error&quot;) then a double bit error either has not occurred, or has cancelled itself out. Otherwise, a double bit error has occurred.

<text>In information theory, the Hamming distance between two strings or vectors of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In other words, it measures the minimum number of &quot;substitutions&quot; required to change one string into the other, or equivalently, the minimum number of &quot;errors&quot; that could have transformed one string into the other. In a more general context, the Hamming distance is one of several string metrics for measuring the edit distance between two sequences. It is named after the American mathematician Richard Hamming.

A major application is in coding theory, more specifically to block codes, in which the equal-length strings are vectors over a finite field.

== Definition ==
The Hamming distance between two equal-length strings of symbols is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.

== Examples ==
The symbols may be letters, bits, or decimal digits, among other possibilities. For example, the Hamming distance between:
* &quot;kain&quot; and &quot;kain&quot; is 3.
* &quot;krin&quot; and &quot;krin&quot; is 3.
* &quot;kin&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; is 4.
* &#x27; and &#x27; is 4.
* 2396 and 2396 is 3.

== Properties ==
For a fixed length &quot;n&quot;, the Hamming distance is a metric on the set of the words of length &quot;n&quot; (also known as a Hamming space), as it fulfills the conditions of non-negativity, symmetry, the Hamming distance of two words is 0 if and only if the two words are identical, and it satisfies the triangle inequality as well: Indeed, if we fix three words &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, then whenever there is a difference between the &quot;i&quot;th letter of &quot;a&quot; and the &quot;i&quot;th letter of &quot;c&quot;, then there must be a difference between the &quot;i&quot;th letter of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;i&quot;th letter of &quot;b&quot;, or between the &quot;i&quot;th letter of &quot;b&quot; and the &quot;i&quot;th letter of &quot;c&quot;. Hence the Hamming distance between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; is not larger than the sum of the Hamming distances between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and between &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;. The Hamming distance between two words &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; can also be seen as the Hamming weight of &quot;a&quot; − &quot;b&quot; for an appropriate choice of the − operator, much as the difference between two integers can be seen as a distance from zero on the number line.

For binary strings &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; the Hamming distance is equal to the number of ones (population count) in &quot;a&quot; XOR &quot;b&quot;. The metric space of length-&quot;n&quot; binary strings, with the Hamming distance, is known as the &quot;Hamming cube&quot;; it is equivalent as a metric space to the set of distances between vertices in a hypercube graph. One can also view a binary string of length &quot;n&quot; as a vector in formula_1 by treating each symbol in the string as a real coordinate; with this embedding, the strings form the vertices of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hypercube, and the Hamming distance of the strings is equivalent to the Manhattan distance between the vertices.

== Error detection and error correction ==
The minimum Hamming distance or minimum distance (usually denoted by &quot;dmin&quot;) is used to define some essential notions in coding theory, such as error detecting and error correcting codes. In particular, a code &quot;C&quot; is said to be &quot;k&quot; error detecting if, and only if, the minimum Hamming distance between any two of its codewords is at least &quot;k&quot;+1.

For example, consider a code consisting of two codewords &quot;000&quot; and &quot;111&quot;. The Hamming distance between these two words is 3, and therefore it is &quot;k&quot;=2 error detecting. This means that if one bit is flipped or two bits are flipped, the error can be detected. If three bits are flipped, then &quot;000&quot; becomes &quot;111&quot; and the error cannot be detected.

A code &quot;C&quot; is said to be &quot;k-error correcting&quot; if, for every word &quot;w&quot; in the underlying Hamming space &quot;H&quot;, there exists at most one codeword &quot;c&quot; (from &quot;C&quot;) such that the Hamming distance between &quot;w&quot; and &quot;c&quot; is at most &quot;k&quot;. In other words, a code is &quot;k&quot;-errors correcting if the minimum Hamming distance between any two of its codewords is at least 2&quot;k&quot;+1. This is also understood geometrically as any closed balls of radius &quot;k&quot; centered on distinct codewords being disjoint. These balls are also called &quot;Hamming spheres&quot; in this context.

For example, consider the same 3-bit code consisting of the two codewords &quot;000&quot; and &quot;111&quot;. The Hamming space consists of 8 words 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110 and 111. The codeword &quot;000&quot; and the single bit error words &quot;001&quot;,&quot;010&quot;,&quot;100&quot; are all less than or equal to the Hamming distance of 1 to &quot;000&quot;. Likewise, codeword &quot;111&quot; and its single bit error words &quot;110&quot;,&quot;101&quot; and &quot;011&quot; are all within 1 Hamming distance of the original &quot;111&quot;. In this code, a single bit error is always within 1 Hamming distance of the original codes, and the code can be &quot;1-error correcting&quot;, that is &quot;k=1&quot;. Since the Hamming distance between &quot;000&quot; and &quot;111&quot; is 3, and those comprise the entire set of codewords in the code, the minimum Hamming distance is 3, which satisfies &quot;2k+1 = 3&quot;.

Thus a code with minimum Hamming distance &quot;d&quot; between its codewords can detect at most &quot;d&quot;-1 errors and can correct ⌊(&quot;d&quot;-1)/2⌋ errors. The latter number is also called the &quot;packing radius&quot; or the &quot;error-correcting capability&quot; of the code.

== History and applications ==

The Hamming distance is named after Richard Hamming, who introduced the concept in his fundamental paper on Hamming codes, &quot;Error detecting and error correcting codes&quot;, in 1950. Hamming weight analysis of bits is used in several disciplines including information theory, coding theory, and cryptography.

It is used in telecommunication to count the number of flipped bits in a fixed-length binary word as an estimate of error, and therefore is sometimes called the signal distance. For &quot;q&quot;-ary strings over an alphabet of size &quot;q&quot; ≥ 2 the Hamming distance is applied in case of the q-ary symmetric channel, while the Lee distance is used for phase-shift keying or more generally channels susceptible to synchronization errors because the Lee distance accounts for errors of ±1. If formula_2 or formula_3 both distances coincide because any pair of elements from formula_4 or formula_5 differ by 1, but the distances are different for larger formula_6.

The Hamming distance is also used in systematics as a measure of genetic distance.

However, for comparing strings of different lengths, or strings where not just substitutions but also insertions or deletions have to be expected, a more sophisticated metric like the Levenshtein distance is more appropriate.

== Algorithm example ==

The following function, written in Python 3, returns the Hamming distance between two strings:

def hamming_distance(string1: str, string2: str) -&gt; int:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the Hamming distance between two strings.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 if len(string1) != len(string2):
 raise ValueError(&quot;Strings must be of equal length.&quot;)
 dist_counter = 0
 for n in range(len(string1)):
 if string1[n] != string2[n]:
 dist_counter += 1
 return dist_counter
Or, in a shorter expression:

sum(char1 != char2 for char1, char2 in zip(string1, string2, strict=True))
The function codice_1, implemented in Python 3, computes the Hamming distance between two strings (or other iterable objects) of equal length by creating a sequence of Boolean values indicating mismatches and matches between corresponding positions in the two inputs, then summing the sequence with True and False values, interpreted as one and zero, respectively.

def hamming_distance(s1: str, s2: str) -&gt; int:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the Hamming distance between equal-length sequences.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 if len(s1) != len(s2):
 raise ValueError(&quot;Undefined for sequences of unequal length.&quot;)
 return sum(char1 != char2 for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2))

where the zip() function merges two equal-length collections in pairs.

The following C function will compute the Hamming distance of two integers (considered as binary values, that is, as sequences of bits). The running time of this procedure is proportional to the Hamming distance rather than to the number of bits in the inputs. It computes the bitwise exclusive or of the two inputs, and then finds the Hamming weight of the result (the number of nonzero bits) using an algorithm of that repeatedly finds and clears the lowest-order nonzero bit. Some compilers support the __builtin_popcount function which can calculate this using specialized processor hardware where available.
int hamming_distance(unsigned x, unsigned y)
 int dist = 0;

 // The ^ operators sets to 1 only the bits that are different
 for (unsigned val = x ^ y; val &gt; 0; ++dist)
 // We then count the bit set to 1 using the Peter Wegner way
 val = val &amp; (val - 1); // Set to zero val&#x27;s lowest-order 1

 // Return the number of differing bits
 return dist;


A faster alternative is to use the population count (&quot;popcount&quot;) assembly instruction. Certain compilers such as GCC and Clang make it available via an intrinsic function:
// Hamming distance for 32-bit integers
int hamming_distance32(unsigned int x, unsigned int y)
 return __builtin_popcount(x ^ y);

// Hamming distance for 64-bit integers
int hamming_distance64(unsigned long long x, unsigned long long y)
 return __builtin_popcountll(x ^ y);

<doc id="41229" wikidata="Q548838" url="?curid=41229" title="Handshake (computing)">
<text>In computing, a handshake is a signal between two devices or programs, used to, e.g., authenticate, coordinate. An example is the handshaking between a hypervisor and an application in a guest virtual machine.

In telecommunications, a handshake is an automated process of negotiation between two participants (example &quot;Alice and Bob&quot;) through the exchange of information that establishes the protocols of a communication link at the start of the communication, before full communication begins. The handshaking process usually takes place in order to establish rules for communication when a computer attempts to communicate with another device. Signals are usually exchanged between two devices to establish a communication link. For example, when a computer communicates with another device such as a modem, the two devices will signal each other that they are switched on and ready to work, as well as to agree to which protocols are being used.

Handshaking can negotiate parameters that are acceptable to equipment and systems at both ends of the communication channel, including information transfer rate, coding alphabet, parity, interrupt procedure, and other protocol or hardware features.
Handshaking is a technique of communication between two entities. However, within TCP/IP RFCs, the term &quot;handshake&quot; is most commonly used to reference the TCP three-way handshake. For example, the term &quot;handshake&quot; is not present in RFCs covering FTP or SMTP. One exception is Transport Layer Security, TLS, setup, FTP RFC 4217. In place of the term &quot;handshake&quot;, FTP RFC 3659 substitutes the term &quot;conversation&quot; for the passing of commands.

A simple handshaking protocol might only involve the receiver sending a message meaning &quot;I received your last message and I am ready for you to send me another one.&quot; A more complex handshaking protocol might allow the sender to ask the receiver if it is ready to receive or for the receiver to reply with a negative acknowledgement meaning &quot;I did not receive your last message correctly, please resend it&quot; (e.g., if the data was corrupted en route).

Handshaking facilitates connecting relatively heterogeneous systems or equipment over a communication channel without the need for human intervention to set parameters.

== Example ==

=== TCP three-way handshake ===

Establishing a normal TCP connection requires three separate steps:
:# The first host (Alice) sends the second host (Bob) a &quot;synchronize&quot; (SYN) message with its own sequence number formula_1, which Bob receives.
:# Bob replies with a synchronize-acknowledgment (SYN-ACK) message with its own sequence number formula_2 and acknowledgement number formula_3, which Alice receives.
:# Alice replies with an acknowledgment (ACK) message with acknowledgement number formula_4, which Bob receives and to which he doesn&#x27;t need to reply.
: In this setup, the synchronize messages act as service requests from one server to the other, while the acknowledgement messages return to the requesting server to let it know the message was received.

The reason for the client and server not using a default sequence number such as 0 for establishing the connection is to protect against two incarnations of the same connection reusing the same sequence number too soon, which means a segment from an earlier incarnation of a connection might interfere with a later incarnation of the connection.

=== SMTP === 
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the key Internet standard for email transmission. It includes handshaking to negotiate authentication, encryption and maximum message size. 

=== TLS handshake ===

When a Transport Layer Security (SSL or TLS) connection starts, the record encapsulates a &quot;control&quot; protocol—the handshake messaging protocol (content type 22). This protocol is used to exchange all the information required by both sides for the exchange of the actual application data by TLS. It defines the messages formatting or containing this information and the order of their exchange. These may vary according to the demands of the client and server—i.e., there are several possible procedures to set up the connection. This initial exchange results in a successful TLS connection (both parties ready to transfer application data with TLS) or an alert message (as specified below).

The protocol is used to negotiate the secure attributes of a session. (RFC 5246, p. 37)

=== WPA2 wireless ===
The WPA2 standard for wireless uses a four-way handshake defined in IEEE 802.11i-2004.

=== Dial-up access modems ===
One classic example of handshaking is that of dial-up modems, which typically negotiate communication parameters for a brief period when a connection is first established, and there after use those parameters to provide optimal information transfer over the channel as a function of its quality and capacity. The &quot;squealing&quot; (which is actually a sound that changes in pitch 100 times every second) noises made by some modems with speaker output immediately after a connection is established are in fact the sounds of modems at both ends engaging in a handshaking procedure; once the procedure is completed, the speaker might be silenced, depending on the settings of operating system or the application controlling the modem.

=== Serial &quot;Hardware Handshaking&quot; ===

This frequently used term describes the use of RTS and CTS signals over a serial interconnection. It is, however, not quite correct; it&#x27;s not a true form of handshaking, and is better described as flow control.

=== Mobile device charging ===
In mobile device chargers offering special quick-charge abilities to supported devices, the charging process will switch up to a higher output voltage for increased power transfer. But this could cause serious damage to an unsupported device or even result in a fire. It is therefore very important for the device and charger to first perform a handshake to &quot;agree&quot; on mutually supported charge parameters. If such a charger can&#x27;t identify the connected device or determine its compatibility, it will default to normal but much slower charge parameters within the USB standard.

<doc id="41230" wikidata="Q5372066" url="?curid=41230" title="Hard copy">
<text>In information handling, the U.S. Federal Standard 1037C (Glossary of Telecommunication Terms) defines a hard copy as a permanent reproduction, or copy, in the form of a physical object, of any media suitable for direct use by a person (in particular paper), of displayed or transmitted data. Examples of hard copies include teleprinter pages, continuous printed tapes, computer printouts, and radio photo prints. On the other hand, physical objects such as magnetic tapes, floppy disks, or non-printed punched paper tapes are not defined as hard copies by 1037C.

A file that can be viewed without printing on a screen is sometimes called a soft copy. The U.S. Federal Standard 1037C defines &quot;soft copy&quot; as &quot;a nonpermanent display image, for example, a cathode ray tube display.&quot;

The term &quot;hard copy&quot; predates the digital computer. In the book and newspaper printing process, &quot;hard copy&quot; refers to a manuscript or typewritten document that has been edited and proofread and is ready for typesetting or being read on-air in a radio or television broadcast. The old meaning of hard copy was mostly discarded after the information revolution.

==Use in computer security==
One often-overlooked use for printers is in the field of IT security. Copies of various system and server activity logs are typically stored on the local filesystem, where a remote attacker – having achieved their primary goals – can then alter or delete the contents of the logs in an attempt to &quot;cover their tracks&quot; or otherwise thwart the efforts of system administrators and security experts. However, if the log entries are simultaneously given to a printer, line-by-line, a local hard-copy record of system activity is created – which cannot be remotely altered or otherwise manipulated. Dot matrix printers are ideal for this task, as they can sequentially print each log entry, one at a time, as they are added to the log. The usual dot-matrix printer support for continuous stationery also prevents incriminating pages from being surreptitiously removed or altered without evidence of tampering.
== &quot;Dead-tree&quot; dysphemism ==
The hacker&#x27;s &quot;Jargon File&quot; defines a &quot;dead-tree version&quot; to be a paper version of an online document, where &quot;dead trees&quot; refer to paper.

A saying from the &quot;Jargon File&quot; is that &quot;You can&#x27;t grep dead trees&quot;, which comes from the Unix command , which searches the contents of text files. This means that there is an advantage to keeping documents in digital form, rather than on paper, so that they can be more easily searched for specific contents. A similarly entry in the &quot;Jargon File&quot; is &quot;tree-killer&quot;, which may refer either to a printer or a person who wastes paper.

&quot;Dead-tree edition&quot; refers to a printed paper version of a written work, as opposed to digital alternatives such as a web page.

<text>Hard sectoring in a magnetic or optical data storage device is a form of sectoring which uses a physical mark or hole in the recording medium to reference sector locations.

In older 8- and 5-inch floppy disks, hard sectoring was implemented by punching sector holes in the disk to mark the start
of each sector. These were equally spaced holes, at a common radius. This was in addition to the index hole, situated between two sector holes, to mark the start of the entire track of sectors. When the index or sector hole was recognized by an optical sensor, a sector signal was generated. Timing electronics or software would use the faster timing of the index hole between sector holes, to generate an index signal. Data read and write is faster in this technique than soft sectoring as no operations are to be performed regarding the starting and ending points of tracks.

==Storage formats using hard sectoring==

*32 sector 8-inch floppy disks
*10 sector and 16 sector 5-inch floppy disks
*Numerous magneto-optical formats

<text>In physics, acoustics, and telecommunications, a harmonic is a sinusoidal wave with a frequency that is a positive integer multiple of the &quot;fundamental frequency&quot; of a periodic signal. The fundamental frequency is also called the 1st harmonic; the other harmonics are known as higher harmonics. As all harmonics are periodic at the fundamental frequency, the sum of harmonics is also periodic at that frequency. The set of harmonics forms a &quot;harmonic series&quot;.

The term is employed in various disciplines, including music, physics, acoustics, electronic power transmission, radio technology, and other fields. For example, if the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz, a common AC power supply frequency, the frequencies of the first three higher harmonics are 100 Hz (2nd harmonic), 150 Hz (3rd harmonic), 200 Hz (4th harmonic) and any addition of waves with these frequencies is periodic at 50 Hz.

In music, harmonics are used on string instruments and wind instruments as a way of producing sound on the instrument, particularly to play higher notes and, with strings, obtain notes that have a unique sound quality or &quot;tone colour&quot;. On strings, bowed harmonics have a &quot;glassy&quot;, pure tone. On stringed instruments, harmonics are played by touching (but not fully pressing down the string) at an exact point on the string while sounding the string (plucking, bowing, etc.); this allows the harmonic to sound, a pitch which is always higher than the fundamental frequency of the string.

==Terminology==
Harmonics may be called &quot;overtones&quot;, &quot;partials&quot;, or &quot;upper partials&quot;, and in some music contexts, the terms &quot;harmonic&quot;, &quot;overtone&quot; and &quot;partial&quot; are used fairly interchangeably. But more precisely, the term &quot;harmonic&quot; includes &quot;all&quot; pitches in a harmonic series (including the fundamental frequency) while the term &quot;overtone&quot; only includes pitches &quot;above&quot; the fundamental. 

==Characteristics==
Most acoustic instruments emit complex tones containing many individual partials (component simple tones or sinusoidal waves), but the untrained human ear typically does not perceive those partials as separate phenomena. Rather, a musical note is perceived as one sound, the quality or timbre of that sound being a result of the relative strengths of the individual partials. Many acoustic oscillators, such as the human voice or a bowed violin string, produce complex tones that are more or less periodic, and thus are composed of partials that are nearly matched to the integer multiples of fundamental frequency and therefore resemble the ideal harmonics and are called &quot;harmonic partials&quot; or simply &quot;harmonics&quot; for convenience (although it&#x27;s not strictly accurate to call a  &quot;partial&quot;  a  &quot;harmonic&quot;,  the first being actual and the second being theoretical).

Oscillators that produce harmonic partials behave somewhat like one-dimensional resonators, and are often long and thin, such as a guitar string or a column of air open at both ends (as with the metallic modern orchestral transverse flute). Wind instruments whose air column is open at only one end, such as trumpets and clarinets, also produce partials resembling harmonics. However they only produce partials matching the &quot;odd&quot; harmonics—at least in theory. In practical use, no real acoustic instrument behaves as perfectly as the simplified physical models predict; for example, instruments made of non-linearly elastic wood, instead of metal, or strung with gut instead of brass or steel strings, tend to have not-quite-integer partials.

Partials whose frequencies are not integer multiples of the fundamental are referred to as inharmonic partials. Some acoustic instruments emit a mix of harmonic and inharmonic partials but still produce an effect on the ear of having a definite fundamental pitch, such as pianos, strings plucked pizzicato, vibraphones, marimbas, and certain pure-sounding bells or chimes. Antique singing bowls are known for producing multiple harmonic partials or multiphonics.

Other oscillators, such as cymbals, drum heads, and most percussion instruments, naturally produce an abundance of inharmonic partials and do not imply any particular pitch, and therefore cannot be used melodically or harmonically in the same way other instruments can.

Building on of Sethares (2004), dynamic tonality introduces the notion of pseudo-harmonic partials, in which the frequency of each partial is aligned to match the pitch of a corresponding note in a pseudo-just tuning, thereby maximizing the consonance of that pseudo-harmonic timbre with notes of that pseudo-just tuning.

==Partials, overtones, and harmonics==
An overtone is any partial higher than the lowest partial in a compound tone. The relative strengths and frequency relationships of the component partials determine the timbre of an instrument. The similarity between the terms overtone and partial sometimes leads to their being loosely used interchangeably in a musical context, but they are counted differently, leading to some possible confusion. In the special case of instrumental timbres whose component partials closely match a harmonic series (such as with most strings and winds) rather than being inharmonic partials (such as with most pitched percussion instruments), it is also convenient to call the component partials &quot;harmonics&quot;, but not strictly correct, because harmonics are numbered the same even when missing, while partials and overtones are only counted when present. This chart demonstrates how the three types of names (partial, overtone, and harmonic) are counted (assuming that the harmonics are present):

In many musical instruments, it is possible to play the upper harmonics without the fundamental note being present. In a simple case (e.g., recorder) this has the effect of making the note go up in pitch by an octave, but in more complex cases many other pitch variations are obtained. In some cases it also changes the timbre of the note. This is part of the normal method of obtaining higher notes in wind instruments, where it is called &quot;overblowing&quot;. The extended technique of playing multiphonics also produces harmonics. On string instruments it is possible to produce very pure sounding notes, called harmonics or &quot;flageolets&quot; by string players, which have an eerie quality, as well as being high in pitch. Harmonics may be used to check at a unison the tuning of strings that are not tuned to the unison. For example, lightly fingering the node found halfway down the highest string of a cello produces the same pitch as lightly fingering the node of the way down the second highest string. For the human voice see Overtone singing, which uses harmonics.

While it is true that electronically produced periodic tones (e.g. square waves or other non-sinusoidal waves) have &quot;harmonics&quot; that are whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency, practical instruments do not all have this characteristic. For example, higher &quot;harmonics&quot; of piano notes are not true harmonics but are &quot;overtones&quot; and can be very sharp, i.e. a higher frequency than given by a pure harmonic series. This is especially true of instruments other than strings, brass, or woodwinds. Examples of these &quot;other&quot; instruments are xylophones, drums, bells, chimes, etc.; not all of their overtone frequencies make a simple whole number ratio with the fundamental frequency. (The fundamental frequency is the reciprocal of the longest time period of the collection of vibrations in some single periodic phenomenon.)

==On stringed instruments==

The following table displays the stop points on a stringed instrument at which gentle touching of a string will force it into a harmonic mode when vibrated. String harmonics (flageolet tones) are described as having a &quot;flutelike, silvery quality&quot; that can be highly effective as a special color or tone color (timbre) when used and heard in orchestration. It is unusual to encounter natural harmonics higher than the fifth partial on any stringed instrument except the double bass, on account of its much longer strings.
:

===Artificial harmonics===

Occasionally a score will call for an artificial harmonic, produced by playing an overtone on an already stopped string. As a performance technique, it is accomplished by using two fingers on the fingerboard, the first to shorten the string to the desired fundamental, with the second touching the node corresponding to the appropriate harmonic.

==Other information==

Harmonics may be either used in or considered as the basis of just intonation systems. Composer Arnold Dreyblatt is able to bring out different harmonics on the single string of his modified double bass by slightly altering his unique bowing technique halfway between hitting and bowing the strings. Composer Lawrence Ball uses harmonics to generate music electronically.

<doc id="41234" wikidata="Q760140" url="?curid=41234" title="Heterodyne">
<text>A heterodyne is a signal frequency that is created by combining or mixing two other frequencies using a signal processing technique called &quot;heterodyning&quot;, which was invented by Canadian inventor-engineer Reginald Fessenden. Heterodyning is used to shift signals from one frequency range into another, and is also involved in the processes of modulation and demodulation. The two input frequencies are combined in a nonlinear signal-processing device such as a vacuum tube, transistor, or diode, usually called a &quot;mixer&quot;.

In the most common application, two signals at frequencies and are mixed, creating two new signals, one at the sum of the two frequencies , and the other at the difference between the two frequencies . The new signal frequencies are called &quot;heterodynes&quot;. Typically, only one of the heterodynes is required and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer. Heterodyne frequencies are related to the phenomenon of &quot;beats&quot; in acoustics.

A major application of the heterodyne process is in the superheterodyne radio receiver circuit, which is used in virtually all modern radio receivers.

==History==
In 1901, Reginald Fessenden demonstrated a direct-conversion receiver or beat receiver as a method of making continuous wave radiotelegraphy signals audible. Fessenden&#x27;s receiver did not see much application because of its local oscillator&#x27;s stability problem. A stable yet inexpensive local oscillator was not available until Lee de Forest invented the triode vacuum tube oscillator. In a 1905 patent, Fessenden stated that the frequency stability of his local oscillator was one part per thousand.

In radio telegraphy, the characters of text messages are translated into the short duration dots and long duration dashes of Morse code that are broadcast as radio signals. Radio telegraphy was much like ordinary telegraphy. One of the problems was building high power transmitters with the technology of the day. Early transmitters were spark gap transmitters. A mechanical device would make sparks at a fixed but audible rate; the sparks would put energy into a resonant circuit that would then ring at the desired transmission frequency (which might be 100 kHz). This ringing would quickly decay, so the output of the transmitter would be a succession of damped waves. When these damped waves were received by a simple detector, the operator would hear an audible buzzing sound that could be transcribed back into alpha-numeric characters.

With the development of the arc converter radio transmitter in 1904, continuous wave (CW) modulation began to be used for radiotelegraphy. CW Morse code signals are not amplitude modulated, but rather consist of bursts of sinusoidal carrier frequency. When CW signals are received by an AM receiver, the operator does not hear a sound. The direct-conversion (heterodyne) detector was invented to make continuous wave radio-frequency signals audible.

The &quot;heterodyne&quot; or &quot;beat&quot; receiver has a local oscillator that produces a radio signal adjusted to be close in frequency to the incoming signal being received. When the two signals are mixed, a &quot;beat&quot; frequency equal to the difference between the two frequencies is created. Adjusting the local oscillator frequency correctly puts the beat frequency in the audio range, where it can be heard as a tone in the receiver&#x27;s earphones whenever the transmitter signal is present. Thus the Morse code &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot; are audible as beeping sounds. This technique is still used in radio telegraphy, the local oscillator now being called the beat frequency oscillator or BFO. Fessenden coined the word &quot;heterodyne&quot; from the Greek roots &quot;hetero-&quot; &quot;different&quot;, and &quot;dyn-&quot; &quot;power&quot; (cf. ).

===Superheterodyne receiver===
An important and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet). In the typical superhet, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed (heterodyned) with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) to produce a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF) signal. The IF signal is amplified and filtered and then applied to a detector that extracts the audio signal; the audio is ultimately sent to the receiver&#x27;s loudspeaker.

The superheterodyne receiver has several advantages over previous receiver designs. One advantage is easier tuning; only the RF filter and the LO are tuned by the operator; the fixed-frequency IF is tuned (&quot;aligned&quot;) at the factory and is not adjusted. In older designs such as the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF), all of the receiver stages had to be simultaneously tuned. In addition, since the IF filters are fixed-tuned, the receiver&#x27;s selectivity is the same across the receiver&#x27;s entire frequency band. Another advantage is that the IF signal can be at a much lower frequency than the incoming radio signal, and that allows each stage of the IF amplifier to provide more gain. To first order, an amplifying device has a fixed gain-bandwidth product. If the device has a gain-bandwidth product of 60 MHz, then it can provide a voltage gain of 3 at an RF of 20 MHz or a voltage gain of 30 at an IF of 2 MHz. At a lower IF, it would take fewer gain devices to achieve the same gain. The regenerative radio receiver obtained more gain out of one gain device by using positive feedback, but it required careful adjustment by the operator; that adjustment also changed the selectivity of the regenerative receiver. The superheterodyne provides a large, stable gain and constant selectivity without troublesome adjustment.

The superior superheterodyne system replaced the earlier TRF and regenerative receiver designs, and since the 1930s most commercial radio receivers have been superheterodynes.

==Applications==
Heterodyning, also called &quot;frequency conversion&quot;, is used very widely in communications engineering to generate new frequencies and move information from one frequency channel to another. Besides its use in the superheterodyne circuit found in almost all radio and television receivers, it is used in radio transmitters, modems, satellite communications and set-top boxes, radar, radio telescopes, telemetry systems, cell phones, cable television converter boxes and headends, microwave relays, metal detectors, atomic clocks, and military electronic countermeasure (jamming) systems.

===Up and down converters===
In large scale telecommunication networks such as telephone network trunks, microwave relay networks, cable television systems, and communication satellite links, large bandwidth capacity links are shared by many individual communication channels by using heterodyning to move the frequency of the individual signals up to different frequencies, which share the channel. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM).

For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels at the same time because each one is given a different frequency, so they do not interfere with one another. At the cable source or headend, electronic upconverters convert each incoming television channel to a new, higher frequency. They do this by mixing the television signal frequency, &quot;fCH&quot; with a local oscillator at a much higher frequency , creating a heterodyne at the sum , which is added to the cable. At the consumer&#x27;s home, the cable set top box has a downconverter that mixes the incoming signal at frequency with the same local oscillator frequency creating the difference heterodyne frequency, converting the television channel back to its original frequency: . Each channel is moved to a different higher frequency. The original lower basic frequency of the signal is called the baseband, while the higher channel it is moved to is called the passband.

===Analog videotape recording===

Many analog videotape systems rely on a downconverted color subcarrier to record color information in their limited bandwidth. These systems are referred to as &quot;heterodyne systems&quot; or &quot;color-under systems&quot;. For instance, for NTSC video systems, the VHS (and S-VHS) recording system converts the color subcarrier from the NTSC standard 3.58 MHz to ~629 kHz. PAL VHS color subcarrier is similarly downconverted (but from 4.43 MHz). The now-obsolete 3/4&quot; U-matic systems use a heterodyned ~688 kHz subcarrier for NTSC recordings (as does Sony&#x27;s Betamax, which is at its basis a 1/2″ consumer version of U-matic), while PAL U-matic decks came in two mutually incompatible varieties, with different subcarrier frequencies, known as Hi-Band and Low-Band. Other videotape formats with heterodyne color systems include Video-8 and Hi8.

The heterodyne system in these cases is used to convert quadrature phase-encoded and amplitude modulated sine waves from the broadcast frequencies to frequencies recordable in less than 1 MHz bandwidth. On playback, the recorded color information is heterodyned back to the standard subcarrier frequencies for display on televisions and for interchange with other standard video equipment.

Some U-matic (3/4″) decks feature 7-pin mini-DIN connectors to allow dubbing of tapes without conversion, as do some industrial VHS, S-VHS, and Hi8 recorders.

===Music synthesis===
The theremin, an electronic musical instrument, traditionally uses the heterodyne principle to produce a variable audio frequency in response to the movement of the musician&#x27;s hands in the vicinity of one or more antennae, which act as capacitor plates. The output of a fixed radio frequency oscillator is mixed with that of an oscillator whose frequency is affected by the variable capacitance between the antenna and the musician&#x27;s hand as it is moved near the pitch control antenna. The difference between the two oscillator frequencies produces a tone in the audio range.

The ring modulator is a type of frequency mixer incorporated into some synthesizers or used as a stand-alone audio effect.

===Optical heterodyning===
Optical heterodyne detection (an area of active research) is an extension of the heterodyning technique to higher (visible) frequencies. Guerra (1995) first published the results of what he called a &quot;form of optical heterodyning&quot; in which light patterned by a 50 nm pitch grating illuminated a second grating of pitch 50 nm, with the gratings rotated with respect to each other by the angular amount needed to achieve magnification. Although the illuminating wavelength was 650 nm, the 50 nm grating was easily resolved. This showed a nearly 5-fold improvement over the Abbe resolution limit of 232 nm that should have been the smallest obtained for the numerical aperture and wavelength used. This super-resolution microscopic imaging through optical heterodyning later came to be know by many as &quot;structured illumination microscopy&quot;. 

In addition to super-resolution optical microscopy, optical heterodyning could greatly improve optical modulators, increasing the density of information carried by optical fibers. It is also being applied in the creation of more accurate atomic clocks based on directly measuring the frequency of a laser beam. 

Since optical frequencies are far beyond the manipulation capacity of any feasible electronic circuit, all visible frequency photon detectors are inherently energy detectors not oscillating electric field detectors. However, since energy detection is inherently &quot;square-law&quot; detection, it intrinsically mixes any optical frequencies present on the detector. Thus, sensitive detection of specific optical frequencies necessitates optical heterodyne detection, in which two different (close by) wavelengths of light illuminate the detector so that the oscillating electrical output corresponds to the difference between their frequencies. This allows extremely narrow band detection (much narrower than any possible color filter can achieve) as well as precision measurements of phase and frequency of a light signal relative to a reference light source, as in a laser Doppler vibrometer.

This phase sensitive detection has been applied for Doppler measurements of wind speed, and imaging through dense media. The high sensitivity against background light is especially useful for lidar.

In optical Kerr effect (OKE) spectroscopy, optical heterodyning of the OKE signal and a small part of the probe signal produces a mixed signal consisting of probe, heterodyne OKE-probe and homodyne OKE signal. The probe and homodyne OKE signals can be filtered out, leaving the heterodyne frequency signal for detection.

Heterodyne detection is often used in interferometry but usually confined to single point detection rather than widefield interferometry, however, widefield heterodyne interferometry is possible using a special camera. Using this technique which a reference signal extracted from a single pixel it is possible to build a highly stable widefield heterodyne interferometer by removing the piston phase component
caused by microphonics or vibrations of the optical components or object.

==Mathematical principle==
Heterodyning is based on the trigonometric identity:

:formula_1

The product on the left hand side represents the multiplication (&quot;mixing&quot;) of a sine wave with another sine wave (both produced by cosine functions). The right hand side shows that the resulting signal is the sum of two sinusoidal terms, one at the sum of the two original frequencies, and one at the difference, which can be dealt with separately, since their (large) frequency difference makes it easy to cleanly filter out one signal&#x27;s frequency, while leaving the other signal unchanged.

Using this trigonometric identity, the result of multiplying two cosine wave signals formula_2 and formula_3 at different frequencies formula_4 and formula_5 can be calculated:

:formula_6

The result is the sum of two sinusoidal signals, one at the sum and one at the difference of the original frequencies.

===Mixer===
The two signals are combined in a device called a &quot;mixer&quot;. As seen in the previous section, an ideal mixer would be a device that multiplies the two signals. Some widely used mixer circuits, such as the Gilbert cell, operate in this way, but they are limited to lower frequencies. However, any &quot;nonlinear&quot; electronic component also multiplies signals applied to it, producing heterodyne frequencies in its output—so a variety of nonlinear components serve as mixers. A nonlinear component is one in which the output current or voltage is a nonlinear function of its input. Most circuit elements in communications circuits are designed to be linear. This means they obey the superposition principle; if formula_7 is the output of a linear element with an input of formula_8:

:formula_9

So if two sine wave signals at frequencies and are applied to a linear device, the output is simply the sum of the outputs when the two signals are applied separately with no product terms. Thus, the function formula_10 must be nonlinear to create mixer products. A perfect multiplier only produces mixer products at the sum and difference frequencies , but more general nonlinear functions produce higher order mixer products: for integers and . Some mixer designs, such as double-balanced mixers, suppress some high order undesired products, while other designs, such as harmonic mixers exploit high order differences.

Examples of nonlinear components that are used as mixers are vacuum tubes and transistors biased near cutoff (class C), and diodes. Ferromagnetic core inductors driven into saturation can also be used at lower frequencies. In nonlinear optics, crystals that have nonlinear characteristics are used to mix laser light beams to create optical heterodyne frequencies.

===Output of a mixer===
To demonstrate mathematically how a nonlinear component can multiply signals and generate heterodyne frequencies, the nonlinear function formula_10 can be expanded in a power series (MacLaurin series):

:formula_12

To simplify the math, the higher order terms above are indicated by an ellipsis (formula_13) and only the first terms are shown. Applying the two sine waves at frequencies and to this device:

:formula_14

:formula_15

:formula_16

It can be seen that the second term above contains a product of the two sine waves. Simplifying with trigonometric identities:

:formula_17

Which leaves the two heterodyne frequencies among the many terms:
:formula_18
along with many other terms not shown.

In addition to components with frequencies at the sum and difference of the two original frequencies, shown above, the output also contains sinusoidal terms at the original frequencies and terms at multiples of the original frequencies etc., called &quot;harmonics&quot;. It also contains much more complicated terms at frequencies of called intermodulation products. These unwanted frequencies, along with the unwanted heterodyne frequency, must be removed from the mixer output by an electronic filter, to leave the desired heterodyne frequency.

<doc id="41236" wikidata="Q5748257" url="?curid=41236" title="Heuristic routing">
<text>Heuristic routing is a system used to describe how deliveries are made when problems in a network topology arise. Heuristic is an adjective used in relation to methods of learning, discovery, or problem solving. Routing is the process of selecting paths to specific destinations. Heuristic routing is used for traffic in the telecommunications networks and transport networks of the world.

Heuristic routing is achieved using specific algorithms to determine a better, although not always optimal, path to a destination. When an interruption in a network topology occurs, the software running on the networking electronics can calculate another route to the desired destination via an alternate available path.

According to :
The heuristic approach to problem solving consists of applying human intelligence, experience, common sense and certain rules of thumb (or heuristics) to develop an acceptable, but not necessarily an optimum, solution to a problem. Of course, determining what constitutes an acceptable solution is part of the task of deciding which approach to use; but broadly defined, an acceptable solution is one that is both reasonably good (close to optimum) and derived within reasonable effort, time, and cost constraints. Often the effort (manpower, computer, and other resources) required, the time limits on when the solution is needed, and the cost to compile, process, and analyze all the data required for deterministic or other complicated procedures preclude their usefulness or favor the faster, simpler heuristic approach. Thus, the heuristic approach is generally used when deterministic techniques or are not available, economical, or practical.

Heuristic routing allows a measure of route optimization in telecommunications networks based on recent empirical knowledge of the state of the network. Data, such as time delay, may be extracted from incoming messages, during specified periods and over different routes, and used to determine the optimum routing for transmitting data back to the sources. 

==IP routing==

The IP routing protocols in use today are based on one of two algorithms: &quot;distance vector&quot; or &quot;link state&quot;. Distance vector algorithms broadcast routing information to all neighboring routers. Link state routing protocols build a topographical map of the entire network based on updates from neighbor routers, and then use the Dijkstra algorithm to compute the shortest path to each destination. Metrics used are based on the number of hops, delay, throughput, traffic, and reliability.

===Distance vector algorithms===
*RIP uses number of hops, or gateways traversed, as its metric
*IGRP uses bandwidth, delay, hop count, link reliability, load, and MTU
*EIGRP uses the (DUAL) Diffusing Update Algorithm
*BGP uses the distance vector algorithm

===Link state algorithms===
*OSPF uses the Dijkstra algorithm.

<text>Hierarchical routing is a method of routing in networks that is based on hierarchical addressing.

==Background==
Most Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) routing is based on a two-level hierarchical routing in which an IP address is divided into a network portion and a host portion. Gateways use only the network portion until an IP datagram reaches a gateway that can deliver it directly. Additional levels of hierarchical routing are introduced by the addition of subnetworks.

==Description==
Hierarchical routing is the procedure of arranging routers in a hierarchical manner. A good example would be to consider a corporate intranet. Most corporate intranets consist of a high speed backbone network. Connected to this backbone are routers which are in turn connected to a particular workgroup. These workgroups occupy a unique LAN. The reason this is a good arrangement is because even though there might be dozens of different workgroups, the span (maximum hop count to get from one host to any other host on the network) is 2. Even if the workgroups divided their LAN network into smaller partitions, the span could only increase to 4 in this particular example.

Considering alternative solutions with every router connected to every other router, or if every router was connected to 2 routers, shows the convenience of hierarchical routing. It decreases the complexity of network topology, increases routing efficiency, and causes much less congestion because of fewer routing advertisements. With hierarchical routing, only core routers connected to the backbone are aware of all routes. Routers that lie within a LAN only know about routes in the LAN. Unrecognized destinations are passed to the default route.

<doc id="41243" wikidata="Q10991973" url="?curid=41243" title="Hotline">
<text>A hotline is a point-to-point communications link in which a call is automatically directed to the preselected destination without any additional action by the user when the end instrument goes off-hook. An example would be a phone that automatically connects to emergency services on picking up the receiver. Therefore, dedicated hotline phones do not need a rotary dial or keypad. A hotline can also be called an automatic signaling, ringdown, or off-hook service.

== For crises and service ==
True hotlines cannot be used to originate calls other than to preselected destinations. However, in common or colloquial usage, a &quot;hotline&quot; often refers to a call center reachable by dialing a standard telephone number, or sometimes the phone numbers themselves.

This is especially the case with 24-hour, noncommercial numbers, such as police tip hotlines or suicide crisis hotlines, which are staffed around the clock and thereby give the appearance of real hotlines. Increasingly, however, the term is found being applied to any customer service telephone number.

==Between states==

=== Russia–United States ===

The most famous hotline between states is the Moscow–Washington hotline, also known as the &quot;red telephone&quot;, although telephones have never been used in this capacity. This direct communications link was established on June 20, 1963, in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, which convinced both sides of the need for better communications. It was the first time used by U.S. President John F. Kennedy on August 30, 1963 and utilized teletypewriter technology, later replaced by telecopier and then by electronic mail.

=== United Kingdom–United States ===

Already during World War II—two decades before the Washington–Moscow hotline was established—there was a hotline between No. 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet War Room bunker under the Treasury, Whitehall; with the White House in Washington, D.C. From 1943 to 1946, this link was made secure by using the very first voice encryption machine, called SIGSALY.

=== China–Russia ===
A hotline connection between Beijing and Moscow was used during the 1969 frontier confrontation between the two countries. The Chinese however refused the Russian peace attempts and ended the communications link. After a reconciliation between the former enemies, the hotline between China and Russia was revived in 1996.

=== France–Russia ===
On his visit to the Soviet Union in 1966, French President Charles de Gaulle announced that a hotline would be established between Paris and Moscow. The line was upgraded from a telex to a high-speed fax machine in 1989.

=== Russia–United Kingdom ===
A London–Moscow hotline was not formally established until a treaty of friendship between the two countries in 1992. An upgrade was announced when Foreign Secretary William Hague visited Moscow in 2011.

=== India–Pakistan ===
On 20 June 2004, both India and Pakistan agreed to extend a nuclear testing ban and to set up an Islamabad–New Delhi hotline between their foreign secretaries aimed at preventing misunderstandings that might lead to nuclear war. The hotline was set up with the assistance of United States military officers.

=== China–United States ===

The United States and China set up a defense hotline in 2008, but it has rarely been used in crises.

=== China–India ===
India and China announced a hotline for the foreign ministers of both countries while reiterating their commitment to strengthening ties and building &quot;mutual political trust&quot;. As of August 2015 the hotline was yet to be made operational.

=== China–Japan ===
In February 2013, the Senkaku Islands dispute gave renewed impetus to a China–Japan hotline, which had been agreed to but due to rising tensions had not been established.

=== North and South Korea ===
Between North and South Korea there are over 40 direct phone lines, the first of which was opened in September 1971. Most of these hotlines run through the Panmunjeom Joint Security Area (JSA) and are maintained by the Red Cross. Since 1971, North Korea has deactivated the hotlines seven times, the last time in February 2016. After Kim Jong-un&#x27;s New Years address, the border hotline was reopened on January 3, 2018.

=== India–United States ===
In August 2015 the hotline between the White House and New Delhi became operational. The decision of establishing this hotline was taken during Obama&#x27;s visit to India in January 2015. This is the first hotline connecting an Indian Prime Minister to a head of state.

<text>In biology, a hybrid is the offspring resulting from combining the qualities of two organisms of different varieties, subspecies, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Generally, it means that each cell has genetic material from two different organisms, whereas an individual where some cells are derived from a different organism is called a chimera. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents such as in blending inheritance (a now discredited theory in modern genetics by particulate inheritance), but can show hybrid vigor, sometimes growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent species are.

Species are reproductively isolated by strong barriers to hybridization, which include genetic and morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization and others after it. Similar barriers exist in plants, with differences in flowering times, pollen vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility and the structure of the chromosomes. A few animal species and many plant species, however, are the result of hybrid speciation, including important crop plants such as wheat, where the number of chromosomes has been doubled.

A form of often intentional human-mediated hybridization is the crossing of wild and domesticated species. This is common in both traditional horticulture and modern agriculture; many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs, and trees have been produced by hybridization. One such flower, &quot;Oenothera lamarckiana&quot;, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy. It is also more occasionally done in the livestock and pet trades; some well-known wild × domestic hybrids are beefalo and wolfdogs. Human selective breeding of domesticated animals and plants has also resulted in the development of distinct breeds (usually called cultivars in reference to plants); crossbreeds between them (without any wild stock) are sometimes also imprecisely referred to as &quot;hybrids&quot;. 

Hybrid humans existed in prehistory. For example, Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans are thought to have interbred as recently as 40,000 years ago.

Mythological hybrids appear in human culture in forms as diverse as the Minotaur, blends of animals, humans and mythical beasts such as centaurs and sphinxes, and the Nephilim of the Biblical apocrypha described as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.
==Significance==
===In evolution===
Hybridization between species plays an important role in evolution, though there is much debate about its significance. Roughly 25% of plants and 10% of animals are known to form hybrids with at least one other species. One example of an adaptive benefit to hybridization is that hybrid individuals can form a &quot;bridge&quot; transmitting potentially helpful genes from one species to another when the hybrid backcrosses with one of its parent species, a process called introgression. Hybrids can also cause speciation, either because the hybrids are genetically incompatible with their parents and not each other, or because the hybrids occupy a different niche than either parent. 

Hybridization is a particularly common mechanism for speciation in plants, and is now known to be fundamental to the evolutionary history of plants. Plants frequently form polyploids, individuals with more than two copies of each chromosome. Whole genome doubling has occurred repeatedly in plant evolution. When two plant species hybridize, the hybrid may double its chromosome count by incorporating the entire nuclear genome of both parents, resulting in offspring that are reproductively incompatible with either parent because of different chromosome counts.

===In conservation===
Human impact on the environment has resulted in an increase in the interbreeding between regional species, and the proliferation of introduced species worldwide has also resulted in an increase in hybridization. This has been referred to as genetic pollution out of concern that it may threaten many species with extinction. Similarly, genetic erosion from monoculture in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. 

The conservation impacts of hybridization between species are highly debated. While hybridization could potentially threaten rare species or lineages by &quot;swamping&quot; the genetically &quot;pure&quot; individuals with hybrids, hybridization could also save a rare lineage from extinction by introducing genetic diversity. It has been proposed that hybridization could be a useful tool to conserve biodiversity by allowing organisms to adapt, and that efforts to preserve the separateness of a &quot;pure&quot; lineage could harm conservation by lowering the organisms&#x27; genetic diversity and adaptive potential, particularly in species with low populations. While endangered species are often protected by law, hybrids are often excluded from protection, resulting in challenges to conservation. 

==Etymology==
The term hybrid is derived from Latin &quot;&quot;, used for crosses such as of a tame sow and a wild boar. The term came into popular use in English in the 19th century, though examples of its use have been found from the early 17th century. Conspicuous hybrids are popularly named with portmanteau words, starting in the 1920s with the breeding of tiger–lion hybrids (liger and tigon).

==As seen by different disciplines==

===Animal and plant breeding===

From the point of view of animal and plant breeders, there are several kinds of hybrid formed from crosses within a species, such as between different breeds. Single cross hybrids result from the cross between two true-breeding organisms which produces an F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.
Double cross hybrids result from the cross between two different F1 hybrids (i.e., there are four unrelated grandparents).
Three-way cross hybrids result from the cross between an F1 hybrid and an inbred line. Triple cross hybrids result from the crossing of two different three-way cross hybrids. Top cross (or &quot;topcross&quot;) hybrids result from the crossing of a top quality or pure-bred male and a lower quality female, intended to improve the quality of the offspring, on average.

 Population hybrids result from the crossing of plants or animals in one population with those of another population. These include interspecific hybrids or crosses between different breeds. In biology, the result of crossing of two populations is called a synthetic population.

In horticulture, the term stable hybrid is used to describe an annual plant that, if grown and bred in a small monoculture free of external pollen (e.g., an air-filtered greenhouse) produces offspring that are &quot;true to type&quot; with respect to phenotype; i.e., a true-breeding organism.

===Biogeography===
Hybridization can occur in the hybrid zones where the geographical ranges of species, subspecies, or distinct genetic lineages overlap. For example, the butterfly &quot;Limenitis arthemis&quot; has two major subspecies in North America, &quot;L. a. arthemis&quot; (the white admiral) and &quot;L. a. astyanax&quot; (the red-spotted purple). The white admiral has a bright, white band on its wings, while the red-spotted purple has cooler blue-green shades. Hybridization occurs between a narrow area across New England, southern Ontario, and the Great Lakes, the &quot;suture region&quot;. It is at these regions that the subspecies were formed. Other hybrid zones have formed between described species of plants and animals.

===Genetics===
From the point of view of genetics, several different kinds of hybrid can be distinguished.
A genetic hybrid carries two different alleles of the same gene, where for instance one allele may code for a lighter coat colour than the other. A structural hybrid results from the fusion of gametes that have differing structure in at least one chromosome, as a result of structural abnormalities. A numerical hybrid results from the fusion of gametes having different haploid numbers of chromosomes. A permanent hybrid results when only the heterozygous genotype occurs, as in &quot;Oenothera lamarckiana&quot;, because all homozygous combinations are lethal. In the early history of genetics, Hugo de Vries supposed these were caused by mutation.

===Genetic complementation===

Genetic complementation is a hybridization test widely used in genetics to determine whether two separately isolated mutants that have the same (or similar) phenotype are defective in the same gene or in different genes (see complementation). If a hybrid organism containing the genomes of two different mutant parental organisms displays a wild type phenotype, it is ordinarily considered that the two parental mutant organisms are defective in different genes. If the hybrid organism displays a distinctly mutant phenotype, the two mutant parental organisms are considered to be defective in the same gene. However, in some cases the hybrid organism may display a phenotype that is only weakly (or partially) wild-type, and this may reflect intragenic (interallelic) complementation.

===Taxonomy===

From the point of view of taxonomy, hybrids differ according to their parentage.
Hybrids between different subspecies (such as between the dog and Eurasian wolf) are called intra-specific hybrids. Interspecific hybrids are the offspring from interspecies mating; these sometimes result in hybrid speciation. Intergeneric hybrids result from matings between different genera, such as between sheep and goats. Interfamilial hybrids, such as between chickens and guineafowl or pheasants, are reliably described but extremely rare. Interordinal hybrids (between different orders) are few, but have been engineered between the sea urchin &quot;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&quot; (female) and the sand dollar &quot;Dendraster excentricus&quot; (male).

==Biology==

===Expression of parental traits===
When two distinct types of organisms breed with each other, the resulting hybrids typically have intermediate traits (e.g., one plant parent has red flowers, the other has white, and the hybrid, pink flowers). Commonly, hybrids also combine traits seen only separately in one parent or the other (e.g., a bird hybrid might combine the yellow head of one parent with the orange belly of the other).

===Mechanisms of reproductive isolation===
Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating individuals from two species, normally from within the same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often sterile, preventing gene flow between the species. Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes between the two species. For example, donkeys have 62 chromosomes, horses have 64 chromosomes, and mules or hinnies have 63 chromosomes. Mules, hinnies, and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis, meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.

A variety of mechanisms limit the success of hybridization, including the large genetic difference between most species. Barriers include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization; others after it.

In plants, some barriers to hybridization include blooming period differences, different pollinator vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility and structural differences of the chromosomes.

===Speciation===

A few animal species are the result of hybridization. The Lonicera fly is a natural hybrid. The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, although its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy. The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs; its population requires the continued presence of at least one of the parent species. Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.

Plant hybridization is more commonplace compared to animal hybridization. Many crop species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid wheats: some have four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid), while other wheat species have (like most eukaryotic organisms) two sets (diploid), so hybridization events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.

Hybridization may be important in speciation in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not increasing the number of sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only eight natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new hybrid genome can remain stable.

Many hybrid zones are known where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids are continually produced in great numbers. These hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems for studying the mechanisms of speciation. Recently DNA analysis of a bear shot by a hunter in the Northwest Territories confirmed the existence of naturally occurring and fertile grizzly–polar bear hybrids.

===Hybrid vigour===

Hybridization between reproductively isolated species often results in hybrid offspring with lower fitness than either parental. However, hybrids are not, as might be expected, always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger or perform better than either parental lineage or variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.

In a hybrid, any trait that falls outside the range of parental variation (and is thus not simply intermediate between its parents) is considered heterotic. &quot;Positive heterosis&quot; produces more robust hybrids, they might be stronger or bigger; while the term &quot;negative heterosis&quot; refers to weaker or smaller hybrids. Heterosis is common in both animal and plant hybrids. For example, hybrids between a lion and a tigress (&quot;ligers&quot;) are much larger than either of the two progenitors, while &quot;tigons&quot; (lioness × tiger) are smaller. Similarly, the hybrids between the common pheasant (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;) and domestic fowl (&quot;Gallus gallus&quot;) are larger than either of their parents, as are those produced between the common pheasant and hen golden pheasant (&quot;Chrysolophus pictus&quot;). Spurs are absent in hybrids of the former type, although present in both parents.

==Human influence==

===Anthropogenic hybridization===

Hybridization is greatly influenced by human impact on the environment, through effects such as habitat fragmentation and species introductions. Such impacts make it difficult to conserve the genetics of populations undergoing introgressive hybridization. Humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as biological control, and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through hybridization.

===Management===
There is a kind of continuum with three semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression (backcrossing with one of the parent species), and hybrid swarms (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species). Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within wildlife management and habitat management. Global climate change is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.

Conservationists disagree on when is the proper time to give up on a population that is becoming a hybrid swarm, or to try and save the still existing pure individuals. Once a population becomes a complete mixture, the goal becomes to conserve those hybrids to avoid their loss. Conservationists treat each case on its merits, depending on detecting hybrids within the population. It is nearly impossible to formulate a uniform hybridization policy, because hybridization can occur beneficially when it occurs &quot;naturally&quot;, and when hybrid swarms are the only remaining evidence of prior species, they need to be conserved as well.

===Genetic mixing and extinction===

Regionally developed ecotypes can be threatened with extinction when new alleles or genes are introduced that alter that ecotype. This is sometimes called genetic mixing. Hybridization and introgression, which can happen in natural and hybrid populations, of new genetic material can lead to the replacement of local genotypes if the hybrids are more fit and have breeding advantages over the indigenous ecotype or species. These hybridization events can result from the introduction of non-native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. Genetic mixing can be especially detrimental for rare species in isolated habitats, ultimately affecting the population to such a degree that none of the originally genetically distinct population remains.

===Effect on biodiversity and food security===

In agriculture and animal husbandry, the Green Revolution&#x27;s use of conventional hybridization increased yields by breeding high-yielding varieties. The replacement of locally indigenous breeds, compounded with unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding (genetic mixing), has reduced the gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds resulting in the loss of genetic diversity. Since the indigenous breeds are often well-adapted to local extremes in climate and have immunity to local pathogens, this can be a significant genetic erosion of the gene pool for future breeding. Therefore, commercial plant geneticists strive to breed &quot;widely adapted&quot; cultivars to counteract this tendency.

==Different taxa==
===In animals===
==== Mammals ====
Familiar examples of equid hybrids are the mule, a cross between a female horse and a male donkey, and the hinny, a cross between a female donkey and a male horse. Pairs of complementary types like the mule and hinny are called reciprocal hybrids. Polar bears and brown bears are another case of a hybridizing species pairs, and introgression among non-sister species of bears appears to have shaped the Ursidae family tree. Among many other mammal crosses are hybrid camels, crosses between a bactrian camel and a dromedary. There are many examples of felid hybrids, including the liger. The oldest-known animal hybrid bred by humans is the kunga equid hybrid produced as a draft animal and status symbol 4,500 years ago in Umm el-Marra, present-day Syria.

The first known instance of hybrid speciation in marine mammals was discovered in 2014. The clymene dolphin (&quot;Stenella clymene&quot;) is a hybrid of two Atlantic species, the spinner and striped dolphins. In 2019, scientists confirmed that a skull found 30 years earlier was a hybrid between the beluga whale and narwhal, dubbed the narluga.

==== Birds ====
Hybridization between species is common in birds. Hybrid birds are purposefully bred by humans, but hybridization is also common in the wild. Waterfowl have a particularly high incidence of hybridization, with at least 60% of species known to produce hybrids with another species. Among ducks, mallards widely hybridize with many other species, and the genetic relationships between ducks are further complicated by the widespread gene flow between wild and domestic mallards.

One of the most common interspecific hybrids in geese occurs between Greylag and Canada geese (Anser anser x Branta canadensis). One potential mechanism for the occurrence of hybrids in these geese is interspecific nest parasitism, where an egg is laid in the nest of another species to be raised by non-biological parents. The chick imprints upon and eventually seeks a mate among the species that raised it, instead of the species of its biological parents. 

Cagebird breeders sometimes breed bird hybrids known as mules between species of finch, such as goldfinch × canary.

==== Amphibians ====
Among amphibians, Japanese giant salamanders and Chinese giant salamanders have created hybrids that threaten the survival of Japanese giant salamanders because of competition for similar resources in Japan.

==== Fish ====
Among fish, a group of about 50 natural hybrids between Australian blacktip shark and the larger common blacktip shark was found by Australia&#x27;s eastern coast in 2012.

Russian sturgeon and American paddlefish were hybridized in captivity when sperm from the paddlefish and eggs from the sturgeon were combined, unexpectedly resulting in viable offspring. This hybrid is called a sturddlefish.

====Cephalochordates====
The two genera &quot;Asymmetron&quot; and &quot;Branchiostoma&quot; are able to produce viable hybrid offspring, even if none have lived into adulthood so far, despite the parents&#x27; common ancestor living tens of millions of years ago.

====Insects====
Among insects, so-called killer bees were accidentally created during an attempt to breed a strain of bees that would both produce more honey and be better adapted to tropical conditions. It was done by crossing a European honey bee and an African bee.

The &quot;Colias eurytheme&quot; and &quot;C. philodice&quot; butterflies have retained enough genetic compatibility to produce viable hybrid offspring. Hybrid speciation may have produced the diverse &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterflies, but that is disputed.

The two closely related harvester ant species &quot;Pogonomyrmex barbatus&quot; and &quot;Pogonomyrmex rugosus&quot; have evolved to depend on hybridization. When a queen fertilizes her eggs with sperm from males of her own species, the offspring is always new queens. And when she fertilizes the eggs with sperm from males of the other species, the offspring is always sterile worker ants (and because ants are haplodiploid, unfertilized eggs become males). Without mating with males of the other species, the queens are unable to produce workers, and will fail to establish a colony of their own.

===In plants===

Plant species hybridize more readily than animal species, and the resulting hybrids are fertile more often. Many plant species are the result of hybridization, combined with polyploidy, which duplicates the chromosomes. Chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so viable seed can be produced.

Plant hybrids are generally given names that include an &quot;×&quot; (not in italics), such as &quot;Platanus × hispanica&quot; for the London plane, a natural hybrid of &quot;P. orientalis&quot; (oriental plane) and &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; (American sycamore). The parent&#x27;s names may be kept in their entirety, as seen in &quot;Prunus persica × Prunus americana&quot;, with the female parent&#x27;s name given first, or if not known, the parent&#x27;s names given alphabetically.

Plant species that are genetically compatible may not hybridize in nature for various reasons, including geographical isolation, differences in flowering period, or differences in pollinators. Species that are brought together by humans in gardens may hybridize naturally, or hybridization can be facilitated by human efforts, such as altered flowering period or artificial pollination. Hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that have some of the characteristics of each of the parent species. Much work is now being done with hybrids between crops and their wild relatives to improve disease resistance or climate resilience for both agricultural and horticultural crops.

Some crop plants are hybrids from different genera (intergeneric hybrids), such as Triticale, × &quot;Triticosecale&quot;, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, &quot;Triticum aestivum&quot;, is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including loganberry (&quot;Rubus&quot; × &quot;loganobaccus&quot;) and grapefruit (&quot;Citrus&quot; × &quot;paradisi&quot;) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as peppermint (&quot;Mentha&quot; × &quot;piperita&quot;), and trees such as the London plane (&quot;Platanus × hispanica&quot;). Among many natural plant hybrids is &quot;Iris albicans&quot;, a sterile hybrid that spreads by rhizome division, and &quot;Oenothera lamarckiana&quot;, a flower that was the subject of important experiments by Hugo de Vries that produced an understanding of polyploidy.

Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid is often a result of chromosome number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes, which leaves them unable to produce chromosomally balanced gametes. While that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat, for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be pointless, it is an attractive attribute in some fruits. Triploid bananas and watermelons are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds and are also parthenocarpic.

===In fungi ===
Hybridization between fungal species is common and well established, particularly in yeast. Yeast hybrids are widely found and used in human-related activities, such as brewing and winemaking. The production of lager beers for instance are known to be carried out by the yeast &quot;Saccharomyces pastorianus&quot;, a cryotolerant hybrid between &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;Saccharomyces eubayanus&quot;, which allows fermentation at low temperatures. 

===In humans===

There is evidence of hybridization between modern humans and other species of the genus &quot;Homo&quot;. In 2010, the Neanderthal genome project showed that 1–4% of DNA from all people living today, apart from most Sub-Saharan Africans, is of Neanderthal heritage. Analyzing the genomes of 600 Europeans and East Asians found that combining them covered 20% of the Neanderthal genome that is in the modern human population. Ancient human populations lived and interbred with Neanderthals, Denisovans, and at least one other extinct &quot;Homo&quot; species. Thus, Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA has been incorporated into human DNA by introgression.

In 1998, a complete prehistorical skeleton found in Portugal, the Lapedo child, had features of both anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals. Some ancient human skulls with especially large nasal cavities and unusually shaped braincases represent human-Neanderthal hybrids. A 37,000- to 42,000-year-old human jawbone found in Romania&#x27;s Oase cave contains traces of Neanderthal ancestry from only four to six generations earlier. All genes from Neanderthals in the current human population are descended from Neanderthal fathers and human mothers.
==Mythology==


Folk tales and myths sometimes contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was the offspring of a human, Pasiphaë, and a white bull. More often, they are composites of the physical attributes of two or more kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion that they are the result of interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the apocryphal Book of Enoch describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.

<text>A hybrid transformer (also known as a bridge transformer, hybrid coil, or just hybrid) is a type of directional coupler which is designed to be configured as a circuit having four ports that are conjugate in pairs, implemented using one or more transformers. It is a particular case of the more general concept of a hybrid coupler.

A signal arriving at one port is divided equally between the two adjacent ports but does not appear at the opposite port. In the schematic diagram, the signal into W splits between X and Z, and no signal passes to Y. Similarly, signals into X split to W and Y with none to Z, etc.

Correct operation requires matched characteristic impedance at all four ports. Forms of hybrid other than transformer coils are possible; any format of directional coupler can be designed to be a hybrid. These formats include transmission lines and waveguides.

== Motivation ==
The primary use of a voiceband hybrid transformer is to convert between 2-wire and 4-wire operation in sequential sections of a communications circuit, for example in a four-wire terminating set. Such conversion was necessary when repeaters were introduced in a 2-wire circuit, a frequent practice at early 20th century telephony. Without hybrids, the output of one amplifier feeds directly into the input of the other, resulting in uncontrollable feedback oscillation (upper diagram). By using hybrids, the outputs and inputs are isolated, resulting in correct 2-wire repeater operation. Late in the century, this practice became rare but hybrids continued in use in line cards.

== Implementations ==

Hybrids are realized using transformers. Two versions of transformer hybrids were used, the single transformer version providing unbalanced outputs with one end grounded, and the double transformer version providing balanced ports. 

=== Single transformer ===
For use in 2-wire repeaters, the single transformer version suffices, since amplifiers in the repeaters have grounded inputs and outputs. X, Y, and Z share a common ground. As shown at left, signal into W, the 2-wire port, will appear at X and Z. But since Y is bridged from center of coil to center of X and Z, no signal appears. Signal into X will appear at W and Y. But signal at Z is the difference of what appears at Y and, through the transformer coil, at W, which is zero. Similar reasoning proves both pairs, W &amp; Y, X &amp; Z, are conjugates.

=== Double transformer ===

When both the 2-wire and the 4-wire circuits must be balanced, double transformer hybrids are used, as shown at right. Signal into port W splits between X and Z, but due to reversed connection to the windings, cancel at port Y. Signal into port X goes to W and Y. But due to reversed connection to ports W and Y, Z gets no signal. Thus the pairs, W &amp; Y, X &amp; Z, are conjugates.

== Applications ==
Telephone hybrids are used in telephone exchanges to convert the 4-wire appearance to the 2-wire last mile connection to the subscriber&#x27;s telephone. A different kind of hybrid is used in telephone handsets to convert the four wires of the transmitter (earpiece) and receiver (microphone) to the 2-wire line connection. This kind of hybrid is more commonly called an &quot;induction coil&quot; due to its derivation from high-voltage induction coils. It does not produce a high voltage, but like the high-voltage variety, it is a step-up transformer in order to impedance match the low-impedance carbon button transmitter to the higher impedance parts of the system. The simple induction coil later evolved into a form of hybrid as a sidetone reduction measure, or volume of microphone output that was fed back to the earpiece. Without this, the phone user&#x27;s own voice would be louder in the earpiece than the other party&#x27;s. Today, the transformer version of the hybrid has been replaced by resistor networks and compact IC versions, which use integrated circuit electronics to do the job of the hybrid coil.

Radio-frequency hybrids are used to split radio signals, including television. The splitter divides the antenna signal to feed multiple receivers.

<text>Hydroxyl ion absorption is the absorption in optical fibers of electromagnetic radiation, including the near-infrared, due to the presence of trapped hydroxyl ions remaining from water as a contaminant. 

The hydroxyl (OH−) ion can penetrate glass during or after product fabrication, resulting in significant attenuation of discrete optical wavelengths, &quot;e.g.&quot;, centred at 1.383 μm, used for communications via optical fibres.

<doc id="41250" wikidata="Q853614" url="?curid=41250" title="Identifier">
<text>An identifier is a name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique object or a unique &quot;class&quot; of objects, where the &quot;object&quot; or class may be an idea, person, physical countable object (or class thereof), or physical noncountable substance (or class thereof). The abbreviation ID often refers to identity, identification (the process of identifying), or an identifier (that is, an instance of identification). An identifier may be a word, number, letter, symbol, or any combination of those.

The words, numbers, letters, or symbols may follow an encoding system (wherein letters, digits, words, or symbols &quot;stand for&quot; [represent] ideas or longer names) or they may simply be arbitrary. When an identifier follows an encoding system, it is often referred to as a code or id code. For instance the ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry standard defines a code as &quot;system of valid symbols that substitute for longer values&quot; in contrast to identifiers without symbolic meaning. Identifiers that do not follow any encoding scheme are often said to be arbitrary Ids; they are arbitrarily assigned and have no greater meaning. (Sometimes identifiers are called &quot;codes&quot; even when they are actually arbitrary, whether because the speaker believes that they have deeper meaning or simply because they are speaking casually and imprecisely.)

The unique identifier (UID) is an identifier that refers to &quot;only one instance&quot;—only one particular object in the universe. A part number is an identifier, but it is not a &quot;unique&quot; identifier—for that, a serial number is needed, to identify &quot;each instance&quot; of the part design. Thus the &quot;identifier&quot; &quot;Model T&quot; identifies the &quot;class&quot; &quot;(model)&quot; of automobiles that Ford&#x27;s Model T comprises; whereas the &quot;unique identifier&quot; &quot;Model T Serial Number 159,862&quot; identifies one specific member of that class—that is, one particular Model T car, owned by one specific person.

The concepts of &quot;name&quot; and &quot;identifier&quot; are denotatively equal, and the terms are thus denotatively synonymous; but they are not always connotatively synonymous, because [[code name]]s and Id numbers are often connotatively distinguished from names in the sense of traditional natural language naming. For example, both &quot;Jamie Zawinski&quot; and &quot;Netscape employee number 20&quot; are identifiers for the same specific human being; but normal English-language connotation may consider &quot;Jamie Zawinski&quot; a &quot;name&quot; and not an &quot;identifier&quot;, whereas it considers &quot;Netscape employee number 20&quot; an &quot;identifier&quot; but not a &quot;name.&quot; This is an emic indistinction rather than an etic one.

==Metadata==
In metadata, an identifier is a language-independent label, sign or token that uniquely identifies an object within an identification scheme. The suffix &quot;identifier&quot; is also used as a representation term when naming a data element.

ID codes may inherently carry metadata along with them. For example, when you know that the food package in front of you has the identifier &quot;2011-09-25T15:42Z-MFR5-P02-243-45&quot;, you not only have that data, you also have the metadata that tells you that it was packaged on September 25, 2011, at 3:42pm UTC, manufactured by Licensed Vendor Number 5, at the Peoria, IL, USA plant, in Building 2, and was the 243rd package off the line in that shift, and was inspected by Inspector Number 45.

Arbitrary identifiers might lack metadata. For example, if a food package just says 100054678214, its ID may not tell anything except identity—no date, manufacturer name, production sequence rank, or inspector number. In some cases, arbitrary identifiers such as sequential serial numbers leak information (i.e. the German tank problem). Opaque identifiers—identifiers designed to avoid leaking even that small amount of information—include &quot;really opaque pointers&quot; and Version 4 UUIDs.

==In computer science==
In computer science, identifiers (IDs) are lexical tokens that name entities. Identifiers are used extensively in virtually all information processing systems. Identifying entities makes it possible to refer to them, which is essential for any kind of symbolic processing.

===In computer languages===

In computer languages, identifiers are tokens (also called symbols) which name language entities. Some of the kinds of entities an identifier might denote include variables, types, labels, subroutines, and packages.

==Ambiguity==
===Identifiers (IDs) versus Unique identifiers (UIDs)===

A resource may carry multiple identifiers. Typical examples are:
* One person with multiple names, nicknames, and forms of address (titles, salutations)
** &quot;For example:&quot; One specific person may be identified by all of the following identifiers: Jane Smith; Jane Elizabeth Meredith Smith; Jane E. M. Smith; Jane E. Smith; Janie Smith; Janie; Little Janie (as opposed to her mother or sister or cousin, Big Janie); Aunt Jane; Auntie Janie; Mom; Grandmom; Nana; Kelly&#x27;s mother; Billy&#x27;s grandmother; Ms. Smith; Dr. Smith; Jane E. Smith, PhD; and Fuzzy (her jocular nickname at work).
* One document with multiple versions
* One substance with multiple names (for example, CAS index names versus IUPAC names; INN generic drug names versus USAN generic drug names versus brand names)

The inverse is also possible, where multiple resources are represented with the same identifier (discussed below).

===Implicit context and namespace conflicts===

Many codes and nomenclatural systems originate within a small namespace. Over the years, some of them bleed into larger namespaces (as people interact in ways they formerly had not, e.g., cross-border trade, scientific collaboration, military alliance, and general cultural interconnection or assimilation). When such dissemination happens, the limitations of the original naming convention, which had formerly been latent and moot, become painfully apparent, often necessitating retronymy, synonymity,
translation/transcoding, and so on. Such limitations generally accompany the shift away from the original context to the broader one. Typically the system shows implicit context (context was formerly assumed, and narrow), lack of capacity (e.g., low number of possible IDs, reflecting the outmoded narrow context), lack of extensibility (no features defined and reserved against future needs), and lack of specificity and disambiguating capability (related to the context shift, where longstanding uniqueness encounters novel nonuniqueness). Within computer science, this problem is called naming collision. The story of the origination and expansion of the CODEN system provides a good case example in a recent-decades, technical-nomenclature context. The capitalization variations seen with specific designators reveals an instance of this problem occurring in natural languages, where the proper noun/common noun distinction (and its complications) must be dealt with. A universe in which every object had a UID would not need any namespaces, which is to say that it would constitute one gigantic namespace; but human minds could never keep track of, or semantically interrelate, so many UIDs.

<doc id="41251" wikidata="Q6002192" url="?curid=41251" title="Image antenna">
<text>In telecommunications and antenna design, an image antenna is an electrical mirror-image of an antenna element formed by the radio waves reflecting from a conductive surface called a ground plane, such as the surface of the earth. It is used as a geometrical technique in calculating the radiation pattern of the antenna.

When a radio antenna is mounted near a conductive surface such as the Earth or a flat metal plate or screen, the radio waves directed toward the surface reflect off it. The radiation received at a distant point is the sum of two contributions: the waves that travel directly from the antenna to the point, and the waves that reach the point after reflecting off the ground plane. Because of the reflection, these second waves appear to come from a second antenna behind the plane, just as a visible object in front of a flat mirror forms a virtual image that seems to lie behind the mirror. The radiation pattern of the antenna is exactly the same as it would be if the ground plane were replaced by a mirror image of the antenna, located an equal distance behind the plane. This second apparent source of radio waves is the image antenna.

The image antenna is used in calculating electric field vectors, magnetic field vectors, and electromagnetic fields emanating from the real antenna, particularly in the vicinity of the antenna and along the ground. Each charge and current in the real antenna has its counterpart in the image, and may also be considered as a source of radiation. 

To form an image of the antenna, the ground plane need not be grounded to the Earth. Many antenna types, such as reflective array antennas, use flat surfaces of metal or metal screen to reflect radio waves from the antenna elements, and these can be analyzed using image antennas. If there is more than one reflective surface in the antenna, as in a corner reflector antenna, each surface forms its own image of the antenna elements. In order to form an image, the ground plane surface must generally have dimensions of at least a quarter-wavelength of the radio waves used.</text><links>

<text>Improved-definition television (IDTV) or enhanced-quality television transmitters and receivers exceed the performance requirements of the NTSC standard, while remaining within the general parameters of NTSC emissions standards. 

IDTV improvements may be made at the television transmitter or receiver. Improvements include enhancements in encoding, digital filtering, scan interpolation, interlaced line scanning, and ghost cancellation. 

IDTV improvements must allow the TV signal to be transmitted and received in the standard 4:3 aspect ratio.

The only relevant implementation of IDTV for NTSC-based broadcasts before the introduction of full-digital TV distribution (DTV) was the Japanese Clear-Vision. In European countries, PALplus and MAC had a similar role.
The more commonly used term for advanced display technology before the advent of high-definition television (HDTV) was enhanced-definition television (EDTV), used for instance for plasma TV sets with a 16:9 aspect ratio in the early 2000s.

<doc id="41256" wikidata="Q6017791" url="?curid=41256" title="Index-matching material">
<text>In optics, an index-matching material is a substance, usually a liquid, cement (adhesive), or gel, which has an index of refraction that closely approximates that of another object (such as a lens, material, fiber-optic, etc.).

When two substances with the same index are in contact, light passes from one to the other with neither reflection nor refraction. As such, they are used for various purposes in science, engineering, and art.

For example, in a popular home experiment, a glass rod is made almost invisible by immersing it in an index-matched transparent fluid such as mineral spirits.

==In microscopy==
In light microscopy, oil immersion is a technique used to increase the resolution of a microscope. This is achieved by immersing both the objective lens and the specimen in a transparent oil of high refractive index, thereby increasing the numerical aperture of the objective lens.

Immersion oils are transparent oils that have specific optical and viscosity characteristics necessary for use in microscopy. Typical oils used have an index of refraction around 1.515. An oil immersion objective is an objective lens specially designed to be used in this way. The index of the oil is typically chosen to match the index of the microscope lens glass, and of the cover slip.

For more details, see the main article, oil immersion. Some microscopes also use other index-matching materials besides oil; see water immersion objective and solid immersion lens.

==In fiber optics==
In fiber optics and telecommunications, an index-matching material may be used in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical splices to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see Optical fiber connector). Without the use of an index-matching material, Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as −14 dB (i.e., 14 dB below the optical power of the incident signal). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is 28 dB plus twice the fiber loss below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog baseband intensity-modulated video signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital optical receiver except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a Distributed Feedback Laser may be affected by back reflection and then fall outside specifications such as Side Mode Suppression Ratio, potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as −10 dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without index matching. This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an optical isolator or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.

For some applications, instead of standard polished connectors (e.g. FC/PC), angle polished connectors (e.g. FC/APC) may be used, whereby the non-perpendicular polish angle greatly reduces the ratio of reflected signal launched into the guided mode even in the case of a fiber-air interface.

==In experimental fluid dynamics==
Index matching is used in liquid-liquid and liquid-solid (Multiphase flow) experimental systems to minimise the distortions that occur in these systems, this is particularly important for systems with many interfaces which become optically inaccessible. Matching the refractive index minimises reflection, refraction, diffraction and rotations that occurs at the interfaces allowing access to regions that would otherwise be inaccessible to optical measurements. This is particularly important for advanced optical measurements like Laser-induced fluorescence, Particle image velocimetry and Particle tracking velocimetry to name a few.

==In art conservation==

If a sculpture is broken into several pieces, art conservators may reattach the pieces using an adhesive such as Paraloid B-72 or epoxy. If the sculpture is made of a transparent or semitransparent material (such as glass), the seam where the pieces are attached will usually be much less noticeable if the refractive index of the adhesive matches the refractive index of the surrounding object. Therefore, art conservators may measure the index of objects and then use an index-matched adhesive. Similarly, losses (missing sections) in transparent or semitransparent objects are often filled using an index-matched material.

==In optical component adhesives==
Certain optical components, such as a Wollaston prism or Nicol prism, are made of multiple transparent pieces that are directly attached to each other. The adhesive is usually index-matched to the pieces. Historically, Canada balsam was used in this application, but it is now more common to use epoxy or other synthetic adhesives.

<doc id="41258" wikidata="Q1498289" url="?curid=41258" title="Inductive coupling">
<text>In electrical engineering, two conductors are said to be inductively coupled or magnetically coupled when they are configured in a way such that change in current through one wire induces a voltage across the ends of the other wire through electromagnetic induction. A changing current through the first wire creates a changing magnetic field around it by Ampere&#x27;s circuital law. The changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) voltage in the second wire by Faraday&#x27;s law of induction. The amount of inductive coupling between two conductors is measured by their mutual inductance. 

The coupling between two wires can be increased by winding them into coils and placing them close together on a common axis, so the magnetic field of one coil passes through the other coil. Coupling can also be increased by a magnetic core of a ferromagnetic material like iron or ferrite in the coils, which increases the magnetic flux. The two coils may be physically contained in a single unit, as in the primary and secondary windings of a transformer, or may be separated. Coupling may be intentional or unintentional. Unintentional inductive coupling can cause signals from one circuit to be induced into a nearby circuit, this is called cross-talk, and is a form of electromagnetic interference.

An inductively coupled transponder consists of a solid state transceiver chip connected to a large coil that functions as an antenna. When brought within the oscillating magnetic field of a reader unit, the transceiver is powered up by energy inductively coupled into its antenna and transfers data back to the reader unit inductively. 

Magnetic coupling between two magnets can also be used to mechanically transfer power without contact, as in the magnetic gear.

==Uses==
Inductive coupling is widely used throughout electrical technology; examples include:
* Electric motors and generators
* Inductive charging products
* Induction cookers and induction heating systems
* Induction loop communication systems
* Metal detectors
* Transformers
* Wireless power transfer
* Testing:
** Radio-frequency identification
** Presence of voltage

==Low-frequency induction==
Low-frequency induction can be a dangerous form of inductive coupling when it happens inadvertently. For example, if a long-distance metal pipeline is installed along a right of way in parallel with a high-voltage power line, the power line can induce current on the pipe. Since the pipe is a conductor, insulated by its protective coating from the earth, it acts as a secondary winding for a long, drawn out transformer whose primary winding is the power line. Voltages induced on the pipe are then a hazard to people operating valves or otherwise touching metal parts of the metal pipeline.

Reducing low-frequency magnetic fields may be necessary when dealing with electronics, as sensitive circuits in close proximity to an instrument with a power transformer may pickup the mains frequency. Twisted wires (e.g. in networking cables) are an effective way of reducing the interference as signals induced in the successive twists cancel. Magnetic shielding is also an effective way of reducing unwanted inductive coupling, though moving the source of the magnetic field away from sensitive electronics is the simplest solution if possible.

Although induced currents can be harmful, they can also be helpful. Electrical distribution line engineers use inductive coupling to tap power for cameras on towers and at substations that allow remote monitoring of the facilities. Using this they can watch from anywhere and not need to worry about changing camera batteries or solar panel maintenance.

<doc id="41262" wikidata="Q16897403" url="?curid=41262" title="Information-transfer transaction">
<text>A transaction is a change of state, an information-transfer transaction is a transaction in which one of the following changes occurs: content, ownership, location, format, etc. An information-transfer transaction usually consists of three consecutive phases called the access phase, the information transfer phase, and the disengagement phase. Examples of these consecutive phases are the copying and transporting of information. Once a transaction occurs there are also costs to consider, which are associated with that certain transaction. When it comes to the transfer of information some transaction costs include time and means (money).

==History of Information-transfer transactions==
There are many social systems and devices that have contributed to information-transfer transactions; starting from people writing letters using postal systems to emailing using information technology. Two main examples of information-transfer transactions technology development is the copying and transportation of information.

==History of Copying==

Copying is the process of duplicating information with the change of location or format of the original information. The transfer transaction of information through copying has been going on for ages and there has been many advances in technology to decrease the time it takes to make copies of said information. The art of copying started with people having to write a copy out by hand, then the printing press, all the way to digital copying with ICTs. These developments lead to quicker information-transfer transactions in the form of distributing copies of original information to others through a changes of location or format.

==History of Transporting==

Transporting is the movement of information with the change of location or ownership of the original information. The transfer transaction of information through transporting has been going on for ages and there has been social and technological developments to decrease the time it takes for information to change ownership or location. The transportation of information started with people sending letters by foot, then by horse, the public and international postal service, all the way down to technology networks. It is these developments which led to the ability to send information further and quicker through information-transfer transactions.

==Transaction Costs==

Every time a transaction occurs, there are always costs to be considered. In the case of information-transfer transactions, one most consider the costs of time and means (money). Both of these costs are corollated with one another in that to decrease one, you must increase the other. For example, say Person #1 sends a letter through the mail, while Person #2 sends letters through email. For Person #1 to send their letter they had to buy paper, means of writing, envelopes, stamps, etc., while Person #2 needed to buy a source of electricity, internet, computer technology, etc. to send an email. It seems like Person #1 has lower transaction costs then Person #2 in terms of means; however, when you look at both information-transfer transactions in terms of time that is a different story. For Person #1 although they had little costs in sending their letter, the time it takes for the transfer of that letter is about 3+ days, while Person #2&#x27;s transfer through email happens in less than minutes, but they endured high mean costs. Therefore, for information-transfer transaction times to decrease, the costs of means have to increase and vice versa.

==Telecommunication==
In telecommunications, an information-transfer transaction is a coordinated sequence of user and communications system actions that cause information present at a source user to become present at a destination user.

<text>In telecommunications, insertion loss is the loss of signal power resulting from the insertion of a device in a transmission line or optical fiber and is usually expressed in decibels (dB). 

If the power transmitted to the load before insertion is &quot;P&quot;T and the power received by the load after insertion is &quot;P&quot;R, then the insertion loss in decibels is given by,

:formula_1

==Electronic filters==

Insertion loss is a figure of merit for an electronic filter and this data is generally specified with a filter. Insertion loss is defined as a ratio of the signal level in a test configuration without the filter installed (formula_2) to the signal level with the filter installed (formula_3). This ratio is described in decibels by the following equation:

:formula_4

For passive filters, formula_3 will be smaller than formula_2. In this case, the insertion loss is positive and measures how much smaller the signal is after adding the filter.

==Link with scattering parameters==

In case the two measurement ports use the same reference impedance, the insertion loss (formula_7) is defined as: 

:formula_8.

Here formula_9 is one of the scattering parameters. Insertion loss is the extra loss produced by the introduction of the DUT between the 2 reference planes of the measurement. The extra loss can be introduced by intrinsic loss in the DUT and/or mismatch. In case of extra loss the insertion loss is defined to be positive.

For safety and reliability reasons, it is desirable that all telecommunications loads be DC powered with minimal AC-powered devices used. Telcordia GR-513, Power Requirements in Telecommunications Plant (LSSGR Section 13), contains detailed industry requirements for using power in an inside plant.

Both integrated and isolated bonding networks as per Telcordia GR-295, Mesh and Isolated Bonding Networks: Definition and Application to Telephone Central Offices, are a technically viable means to ground and bond the equipment in a safe and effective manner. However, the integrated or mesh bonding schemes are preferred over isolated bonding networks because of the added costs and efforts required to manage, control, and maintain the isolation for the equipment, particularly during equipment upgrade and modifications to the plant. This preference is based on a pragmatic desire for lower costs and ease of management, and to simplify operations during plant modifications/upgrades.

For a comprehensive analysis of the energy efficiency and environmental soundness of a power system, one should ideally consider a wider range of factors than strict energy conversion AC-to-DC power efficiency. These environmental factors cover a wider vision known as Industrial Ecology within which each manufacturing step of the products need to be considered from a Design for Environment (DfE) factors standpoint.

<text>The Intelligent Network (IN) is the standard network architecture specified in the ITU-T Q.1200 series recommendations. It is intended for fixed as well as mobile telecom networks. It allows operators to differentiate themselves by providing value-added services in addition to the standard telecom services such as PSTN, ISDN on fixed networks, and GSM services on mobile phones or other mobile devices.

The intelligence is provided by network nodes on the service layer, distinct from the switching layer of the core network, as opposed to solutions based on intelligence in the core switches or equipment. The IN nodes are typically owned by telecommunications service providers such as a telephone company or mobile phone operator.

IN is supported by the Signaling System #7 (SS7) protocol between network switching centers and other network nodes owned by network operators.

==Examples of IN services==

* Televoting
* Call screening
* Local number portability
* Toll-free calls/Freephone
* Prepaid calling
* Account card calling
* Virtual private networks (such as family group calling)
* Centrex service (Virtual PBX)
* Private-number plans (with numbers remaining unpublished in directories)
* Universal Personal Telecommunications service (a universal personal telephone number)
* Mass-calling service
* Prefix free dialing from cellphones abroad
* Seamless MMS message access from abroad
* Reverse charging
* Home Area Discount
* Premium Rate calls
* Call distribution based on various criteria associated with the call
** Location-based routing
** Time-based routing
** Proportional call distribution (such as between two or more call centres or offices)
* Call queueing
* Call transfer

==History and key concepts==
The IN concepts, architecture and protocols were originally developed as standards by the ITU-T which is the standardization committee of the International Telecommunication Union; prior to this a number of telecommunications providers had proprietary implementations. The primary aim of the IN was to enhance the core telephony services offered by traditional telecommunications networks, which usually amounted to making and receiving voice calls, sometimes with call divert. This core would then provide a basis upon which operators could build services in addition to those already present on a standard telephone exchange.

A complete description of the IN emerged in a set of ITU-T standards named Q.1210 to Q.1219, or Capability Set One (CS-1) as they became known. The standards defined a complete architecture including the architectural view, state machines, physical implementation and protocols. They were universally embraced by telecom suppliers and operators, although many variants were derived for use in different parts of the world (see Variants below).

Following the success of CS-1, further enhancements followed in the form of CS-2. Although the standards were completed, they were not as widely implemented as CS-1, partly because of the increasing power of the variants, but also partly because they addressed issues which pushed traditional telephone exchanges to their limits.
The major driver behind the development of the IN was the need for a more flexible way of adding sophisticated services to the existing network. Before the IN was developed, all new features and/or services had to be implemented directly in the core switch systems. This made for long release cycles as the software testing had to be extensive and thorough to prevent the network from failing. With the advent of the IN, most of these services (such as toll-free numbers and geographical number portability) were moved out of the core switch systems and into self-contained nodes, creating a modular and more secure network that allowed the service providers themselves to develop variations and value-added services to their networks without submitting a request to the core switch manufacturer and waiting for the long development process. The initial use of IN technology was for number translation services, e.g. when translating toll-free numbers to regular PSTN numbers; much more complex services have since been built on the IN, such as Custom Local Area Signaling Services (CLASS) and prepaid telephone calls.

==SS7 architecture==
The main concepts (functional view) surrounding IN services or architecture are connected with SS7 architecture:

* &quot;Service Switching Function&quot; (SSF) or &quot;Service Switching Point&quot; (SSP) is co-located with the telephone exchange, and acts as the trigger point for further services to be invoked during a call. The SSP implements the Basic Call State Machine (BCSM) which is a finite-state machine that represents an abstract view of a call from beginning to end (off hook, dialing, answer, no answer, busy, hang up, etc.). As each state is traversed, the exchange encounters &quot;Detection Points (DPs)&quot; at which the SSP may invoke a query to the SCP to wait for further instructions on how to proceed. This query is usually called a trigger. Trigger criteria are defined by the operator and might include the subscriber calling number or the dialed number. The SSF is responsible for controlling calls requiring value added services.
* &quot;Service Control Function&quot; (SCF) or &quot;Service Control Point&quot; (SCP) is a separate set of platforms that receive queries from the SSP. The SCP contains service logic which implements the behaviour desired by the operator, i.e., the services. During service logic processing, additional data required to process the call may be obtained from the SDF. The logic on the SCP is created using the SCE.
* &quot;Service Data Function&quot; (SDF) or &quot;Service Data Point&quot; (SDP) is a database that contains additional subscriber data, or other data required to process a call. For example, the subscriber&#x27;s remaining prepaid credit may be stored in the SDF to be queried in real-time during the call. The SDF may be a separate platform or co-located with the SCP.
* &quot;Service Management Function&quot; (SMF) or &quot;Service Management Point&quot; (SMP) is a platform or cluster of platforms that operators use to monitor and manage the IN services. It contains the management database which stores the services&#x27; configuration, collects the statistics and alarms, and stores the Call Data Reports and Event Data Reports.
* &quot;Service Creation Environment&quot; (SCE) is the development environment used to create the services present on the SCP. Although the standards permit any type of environment, it is fairly rare to see low level languages like C used. Instead, proprietary graphical languages are used to enable telecom engineers to create services directly. The languages are usually of the fourth-generation type, and the engineer may use a graphical interface to build or change a service.
* &quot;Specialized Resource Function&quot; (SRF) or &quot;Intelligent Peripheral&quot; (IP) is a node which can connect to both the SSP and the SCP and deliver special resources into the call, mostly related to voice communication, for example to play voice announcements or collect DTMF tones from the user.

==Protocols==
The core elements described above use standard protocols to communicate with each other. The use of standard protocols allows different manufacturers to concentrate on different parts of the architecture and be confident that they will all work together in any combination.

The interfaces between the SSP and the SCP are SS7 based and have similarities with TCP/IP protocols. The SS7 protocols implement much of the OSI seven-layer model. This means that the IN standards only had to define the application layer, which is called the Intelligent Networks Application Part or INAP. The INAP messages are encoded using ASN.1.

The interface between the SCP and the SDP is defined in the standards to be an X.500 Directory Access Protocol or DAP. A more lightweight interface called LDAP has emerged from the IETF which is considerably simpler to implement, so many SCPs have implemented that instead.

==Variants==
The core CS-1 specifications were adopted and extended by other standards bodies. European flavours were developed by ETSI, American flavours were developed by ANSI, and Japanese variants also exist. The main reasons for producing variants in each region was to ensure interoperability between equipment manufactured and deployed locally (for example different versions of the underlying SS7 protocols exist between the regions).

New functionality was also added which meant that variants diverged from each other and the main ITU-T standard. The biggest variant was called Customised Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic, or CAMEL for short. This allowed for extensions to be made for the mobile phone environment, and allowed mobile phone operators to offer the same IN services to subscribers while they are roaming as they receive in the home network.

CAMEL has become a major standard in its own right and is currently maintained by 3GPP. The last major release of the standard was CAMEL phase 4. It is the only IN standard currently being actively worked on.

Bellcore (subsequently Telcordia Technologies) developed the Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) as the variant of Intelligent Network for North America, and performed the standardization of the AIN on behalf of the major US operators. The original goal of AIN was AIN 1.0, which was specified in the early 1990s (&quot;AIN Release 1&quot;, Bellcore SR-NWT-002247, 1993). AIN 1.0 proved technically infeasible to implement, which led to the definition of simplified AIN 0.1 and AIN 0.2 specifications. In North America, Telcordia SR-3511 (originally known as TA-1129+) and GR-1129-CORE protocols serve to link switches with the IN systems such as Service Control Points (SCPs) or Service Nodes. SR-3511 details a TCP/IP-based protocol which directly connects the SCP and Service Node. GR-1129-CORE provides generic requirements for an ISDN-based protocol which connects the SCP to the Service Node via the SSP.

==Future==
While activity in development of IN standards has declined in recent years, there are many systems deployed across the world which use this technology. The architecture has proved to be not only stable, but also a continuing source of revenue with new services added all the time. Manufacturers continue to support the equipment and obsolescence is not an issue.

Nevertheless, new technologies and architectures have emerged, especially in the area of VoIP and SIP. More attention is being paid to the use of APIs in preference to protocols like INAP, and new standards have emerged in the form of JAIN and Parlay. From a technical viewpoint, the SCE began to move away from its proprietary graphical origins towards a Java application server environment.

The meaning of &quot;intelligent network&quot; is evolving in time, largely driven by breakthroughs in computation and algorithms. From networks enhanced by more flexible algorithms and more advanced protocols, to networks designed using data-driven models to AI enabled networks.

<doc id="41269" wikidata="Q6044344" url="?curid=41269" title="Intensity modulation">
<text>In optical communications, intensity modulation (IM) is a form of modulation in which the optical power output of a source is varied in accordance with some characteristic of the modulating signal. The envelope of the modulated optical signal is an analog of the modulating signal in the sense that the instantaneous power of the envelope is an analog of the characteristic of interest in the modulating signal. 

The recovery of the modulating signal is typically achieved by direct detection, not heterodyning. However, optical heterodyne detection is possible and has been actively studied since 1979. Bell Laboratories had a working, but impractical, system in 1969. Heterodyne and homodyne systems are of interest because they are expected to produce an increase in sensitivity of up to allowing longer hops between islands for instance. Such systems also have the important advantage of very narrow channel spacing in optical frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. OFDM is a step beyond wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Normal WDM using direct detection does not achieve anything like the close channel spacing of radio frequency FDM.

== Intensity modulation with direct detection ==
Intensity Modulation / Direct Detection (IM/DD) is a scheme is simple and cost-effective in fiber optic communication, making it a suitable for various optical communication applications. It involves modulating the optical power of the carrier signal to represent the transmitted data. This modulation can be achieved using techniques, such as on-off keying (OOK). The intensity-modulated optical signal is generated by modulating the amplitude or the current of the light source, typically a laser diode with one or two cavity designs such as Fabry-Perot or distributed feedback (DFB).

At the receiver end, direct detection (DD) is used to recover the modulated signal. The modulated optical signal is detected by a photodetector (most commonly PIN or APD photodiode), which converts the optical power variations into corresponding electrical current or voltage variations. The output of the photodetector is then processed and decoded to retrieve the original information.

<text>In telecommunications, an interface standard is a standard that describes one or more functional characteristics (such as code conversion, line assignments, or protocol compliance) or physical characteristics (such as electrical, mechanical, or optical characteristics) necessary to allow the exchange of information between two or more (usually different) systems or pieces of equipment. Communications protocols are an example. 

An interface standard may include operational characteristics and acceptable levels of performance. 

In the military community, interface standards permit command and control functions to be performed using communication and computer systems.

==Telephones==
There are many interface standards between analog telephone central office equipment and customer-premises equipment. Single voice paths generally include analog audio connections, either a two-wire circuit or four-wire circuit plus signaling paths to indicate call progress and status information, such as ringing, answer supervision, etc. Some of the known interface types are:

<doc id="41278" wikidata="Q904883" url="?curid=41278" title="Interference filter">
<text>An interference filter, dichroic filter, or thin-film filter is an optical filter that reflects some wavelengths (colors) of light and transmits others, with almost no absorption for all wavelengths of interest. An interference filter may be high-pass, low-pass, bandpass, or band-rejection. They are used in scientific applications, as well as in architectural and theatrical lighting.

An interference filter consists of multiple thin layers of dielectric material having different refractive indices. There may also be metallic layers. Interference filters are wavelength-selective by virtue of the interference effects that take place between the incident and reflected waves at the thin-film boundaries. The principle of operation is similar to a Fabry-Perot etalon.

Dichroic mirrors and dichroic reflectors are the same type of device, but are characterized by the colors of light that they reflect, rather than the colors they pass. Dielectric mirrors operate on the same principle, but focus exclusively on reflection.

== Theory ==
Dichroic filters use the principle of thin-film interference, and produce colors in the same way as oil films on water. When light strikes an oil film at an angle, some of the light is reflected from the top surface of the oil, and some is reflected from the bottom surface where it is in contact with the water. Because the light reflecting from the bottom travels a slightly longer path, some light wavelengths are reinforced by this delay, while others tend to be canceled, producing the colors seen. The color transmitted by the filter exhibits a blue shift with increasing angle of incidence, see Dielectric mirror.

In a dichroic mirror or filter, instead of using an oil film to produce the interference, alternating layers of optical coatings with different refractive indices are built up upon a glass substrate. The interfaces between the layers of different refractive index produce phased reflections, selectively reinforcing certain wavelengths of light and interfering with other wavelengths. The layers are usually added by vacuum deposition. By controlling the thickness and number of the layers, the frequency of the passband of the filter can be tuned and made as wide or narrow as desired. Because unwanted wavelengths are reflected rather than absorbed, dichroic filters do not absorb this unwanted energy during operation and so do not become nearly as hot as the equivalent conventional filter (which attempts to absorb all energy except for that in the passband). (See Fabry–Pérot interferometer for a mathematical description of the effect.)

Where white light is being deliberately separated into various color bands (for example, within a color video projector or color television camera), the similar dichroic prism is used instead. For cameras, however, it is now more common to have an absorption filter array to filter individual pixels on a single CCD array.

== Applications ==
Dichroic filters can filter light from a white light source to produce light that is perceived by humans to be highly saturated in color. Such filters are popular in architectural and theatrical applications.
Dichroic reflectors known as cold mirrors are commonly used behind a light source to reflect visible light forward while allowing the invisible infrared light to pass out of the rear of the fixture. Such an arrangement allows intense illumination with less heating of the illuminated object. Many quartz-halogen lamps have an integrated dichroic reflector for this purpose, being originally designed for use in slide projectors to avoid melting the slides, but now widely used for interior home and commercial lighting. This improves whiteness by removing excess red; however, it poses a serious fire hazard if used in recessed or enclosed luminaires by allowing infrared radiation into those luminaires. For these applications non-cool-beam (ALU or Silverback) lamps must be used. Recessed or enclosed luminaires that are unsuitable for use with dichroic reflector lights can be identified by the IEC 60598 No Cool Beam symbol.

In fluorescence microscopy, dichroic filters are used as beam splitters to direct illumination of an excitation frequency toward the sample and then at an analyzer to reject that same excitation frequency but pass a particular emission frequency.

Some LCD projectors use dichroic filters instead of prisms to split the white light from the lamp into the three colours before passing it through the three LCD units.
Older DLP projectors typically transmit a white light source through a color wheel which uses dichroic filters to rapidly switch colors sent through the (monochrome) Digital micromirror device. Newer projectors may use laser or LED light sources to directly emit the desired light wavelengths.

They are used as laser harmonic separators. They separate the various harmonic components of frequency doubled laser systems by selective spectral reflection and transmission.

Dichroic filters are also used to create gobos for high-power lighting products. Pictures are made by overlapping up to four colored dichroic filters.

Photographic enlarger color heads use dichroic filters to adjust the color balance in the print.

Artistic glass jewelry is occasionally fabricated to behave as a dichroic filter. Because the wavelength of light selected by the filter varies with the angle of incidence of the light, such jewelry often has an iridescent effect, changing color as the (for example) earrings swing. Another interesting application of dichroic filters is spatial filtering.

With a technique licensed from Infitec, Dolby Labs uses dichroic filters for screening 3D movies. The left lens of the Dolby 3D glasses transmits specific narrow bands of red, green and blue frequencies, while the right lens transmits a different set of red, green and blue frequencies. The projector uses matching filters to display the images meant for the left and right eyes.

Long-pass dichroic filters applied to ordinary lighting can prevent it from attracting insects. In some cases, such filters can prevent attraction of other wildlife, reducing adverse environmental impact.

== Advantages ==

Dichroic filters have a much longer life than conventional filters; the color is intrinsic in the construction of the hard microscopic layers and cannot &quot;bleach out&quot; over the lifetime of the filter (unlike for example, gel filters). They can be fabricated to pass any passband frequency and block a selected amount of the stopband frequencies. Because light in the stopband is reflected rather than absorbed, there is much less heating of the dichroic filter than with conventional filters. Dichroics are capable of achieving extremely high laser damage thresholds, and are used for all the mirrors on the world&#x27;s most powerful laser, the National Ignition Facility.

<text>An intermediate distribution frame (IDF) is a distribution frame in a central office or customer premises, which cross connects the user cable media to individual user line circuits and may serve as a distribution point for multipair cables from the main distribution frame (MDF) or combined distribution frame (CDF) to individual cables connected to equipment in areas remote from these frames.

IDFs are used for telephone exchange central office, customer-premises equipment, wide area network (WAN), and local area network (LAN) environments, among others.

In central office environments the IDF may contain circuit termination equipment from various auxiliary components. In WAN and LAN environments IDFs can hold devices of different types including backup systems (hard drives or other media as self-contained, or as RAIDs, CD-ROMs, etc.), networking (switches, hubs, routers), and connections (fiber optics, coaxial, category cables) and so on.

<text>In antenna theory, intermediate-field region (also known as intermediate field, intermediate zone or transition zone) refers to the transition region lying between the near-field region and the far-field region in which the field strength of an electromagnetic wave is dependent upon the inverse distance, inverse square of the distance, and the inverse cube of the distance from the antenna. For an antenna that is small compared to the wavelength in question, the intermediate-field region is considered to exist at all distances between 0.1 wavelength and 1.0 wavelength from the antenna.

<doc id="41284" wikidata="Q550893" url="?curid=41284" title="IP address spoofing">
<text>In computer networking, IP address spoofing or IP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a false source IP address, for the purpose of impersonating another computing system.

==Background==
The basic protocol for sending data over the Internet network and many other computer networks is the Internet Protocol (IP). The protocol specifies that each IP packet must have a header which contains (among other things) the IP address of the sender of the packet. The source IP address is normally the address that the packet was sent from, but the sender&#x27;s address in the header can be altered, so that to the recipient it appears that the packet came from another source. 

The protocol requires the receiving computer to send back a response to the source IP address therefore spoofing is mainly used when the sender can anticipate the network response or does not care about the response.

The source IP address provides only limited information about the sender. It may provide general information on the region, city and town when on the packet was sent. It does not provide information on the identity of the sender or the computer being used.

==Applications==
IP address spoofing involving the use of a trusted IP address can be used by network intruders to overcome network security measures, such as authentication based on IP addresses. This type of attack is most effective where trust relationships exist between machines. For example, it is common on some corporate networks to have internal systems trust each other, so that users can log in without a username or password provided they are connecting from another machine on the internal network – which would require them already being logged in. By spoofing a connection from a trusted machine, an attacker on the same network may be able to access the target machine without authentication.

IP address spoofing is most frequently used in denial-of-service attacks, where the objective is to flood the target with an overwhelming volume of traffic, and the attacker does not care about receiving responses to the attack packets. Packets with spoofed IP addresses are more difficult to filter since each spoofed packet appears to come from a different address, and they hide the true source of the attack. Denial of service attacks that use spoofing typically randomly choose addresses from the entire IP address space, though more sophisticated spoofing mechanisms might avoid non-routable addresses or unused portions of the IP address space. The proliferation of large botnets makes spoofing less important in denial of service attacks, but attackers typically have spoofing available as a tool, if they want to use it, so defenses against denial-of-service attacks that rely on the validity of the source IP address in attack packets might have trouble with spoofed packets.

In DDoS attacks, the attacker may decide to spoof the IP source address to randomly generated addresses, so the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets. The replies would then be sent to random addresses that do not end up anywhere in particular. Such packages-to-nowhere are called the backscatter, and there are network telescopes monitoring backscatter to measure the statistical intensity of DDoS attacks on the internet over time.

==Legitimate uses==
The use of packets with a false source IP address is not always evidence of malicious intent. For example, in performance testing of websites, hundreds or even thousands of &quot;vusers&quot; (virtual users) may be created, each executing a test script against the website under test, in order to simulate what will happen when the system goes &quot;live&quot; and a large number of users log in simultaneously.

Since each user will normally have its own IP address, commercial testing products (such as HP LoadRunner, WebLOAD, and others) can use IP spoofing, allowing each user its own &quot;return address&quot; as well.

IP spoofing is also used in some server-side load balancing. It lets the load balancer spray incoming traffic, but not need to be in the return path from the servers to the client. This saves a networking hop through switches and the load balancer as well as outbound message processing load on the load balancer. Output usually has more packets and bytes, so the savings are significant.

==Services vulnerable to IP spoofing==
Configuration and services that are vulnerable to IP spoofing:

* RPC (Remote procedure call services)
* Any service that uses IP address authentication

* The R services suite (rlogin, rsh, etc.)

==Defense against spoofing attacks==
Packet filtering is one defense against IP spoofing attacks. The gateway to a network usually performs ingress filtering, which is blocking of packets from outside the network with a source address inside the network. This prevents an outside attacker spoofing the address of an internal machine. Ideally, the gateway would also perform egress filtering on outgoing packets, which is blocking of packets from inside the network with a source address that is not inside. This prevents an attacker within the network performing filtering from launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a common use of packet filtering, which has been used to secure the environments for sharing data over network and host-based IDS approaches.

It is also recommended to design network protocols and services so that they do not rely on the source IP address for authentication.

===Upper layers===
Some upper layer protocols have their own defense against IP spoofing attacks. For example, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) uses sequence numbers negotiated with the remote machine to ensure that arriving packets are part of an established connection. Since the attacker normally cannot see any reply packets, the sequence number must be guessed in order to hijack the connection. The poor implementation in many older operating systems and network devices, however, means that TCP sequence numbers can be predicted.

== Other definitions ==
The term spoofing is also sometimes used to refer to &quot;header forgery&quot;, the insertion of false or misleading information in e-mail or netnews headers. Falsified headers are used to mislead the recipient, or network applications, as to the origin of a message. This is a common technique of spammers and sporgers, who wish to conceal the origin of their messages to avoid being tracked.

<doc id="41285" wikidata="Q749647" url="?curid=41285" title="Interoperability">
<text>Interoperability is a characteristic of a product or system to work with other products or systems. While the term was initially defined for information technology or systems engineering services to allow for information exchange, a broader definition takes into account social, political, and organizational factors that impact system-to-system performance.

Types of interoperability include syntactic interoperability, where two systems can communicate with each other, and cross-domain interoperability, where multiple organizations work together and exchange information.

==Types==

If two or more systems use common data formats and communication protocols then they are capable of communicating with each other and they exhibit &quot;syntactic interoperability&quot;. XML and SQL are examples of common data formats and protocols. Low-level data formats also contribute to syntactic interoperability, ensuring that alphabetical characters are stored in the same ASCII or a Unicode format in all the communicating systems.

Beyond the ability of two or more computer systems to exchange information, semantic interoperability is the ability to automatically interpret the information exchanged meaningfully and accurately in order to produce useful results as defined by the end users of both systems. To achieve semantic interoperability, both sides must refer to a common information exchange reference model. The content of the information exchange requests are unambiguously defined: what is sent is the same as what is understood.

Cross-domain interoperability involves multiple social, organizational, political, legal entities working together for a common interest or information exchange.

==Interoperability and open standards==
Interoperability implies exchanges between a range of products, or similar products from several different vendors, or even between past and future revisions of the same product. Interoperability may be developed &quot;&quot;, as a special measure between two products, while excluding the rest, by using open standards. When a vendor is forced to adapt its system to a dominant system that is not based on open standards, it is compatibility, not interoperability.

===Open standards===

Open standards rely on a broadly consultative and inclusive group including representatives from vendors, academics and others holding a stake in the development that discusses and debate the technical and economic merits, demerits and feasibility of a proposed common protocol. After the doubts and reservations of all members are addressed, the resulting common document is endorsed as a &quot;common standard&quot;. This document may be subsequently released to the public, and henceforth becomes an &quot;open standard&quot;. It is usually published and is available freely or at a nominal cost to any and all comers, with &quot;no further encumbrances&quot;. Various vendors and individuals (even those who were not part of the original group) can use the standards document to make products that implement the common protocol defined in the standard and are thus &quot;interoperable by design&quot;, with no specific liability or advantage for customers for choosing one product over another on the basis of standardized features. The vendors&#x27; products compete on the quality of their implementation, user interface, ease of use, performance, price, and a host of other factors, while keeping the customer&#x27;s data intact and transferable even if he chooses to switch to another competing product for business reasons.

===&quot;Post facto&quot; interoperability===

&quot;Post facto&quot; interoperability may be the result of the absolute market dominance of a particular product in contravention of any applicable standards, or if any effective standards were not present at the time of that product&#x27;s introduction. The vendor behind that product can then choose to &quot;ignore&quot; any forthcoming standards and not co-operate in any standardization process at all, using its near-monopoly to insist that its product sets the &quot;de facto&quot; standard by its very market dominance. This is not a problem if the product&#x27;s implementation is open &quot;and&quot; minimally encumbered, but it may well be both closed and heavily encumbered (e.g. by patent claims). Because of the network effect, achieving interoperability with such a product is both critical for any other vendor if it wishes to remain relevant in the market, and difficult to accomplish because of lack of cooperation on equal terms with the original vendor, who may well see the new vendor as a potential competitor and threat. The newer implementations often rely on clean-room reverse engineering in the absence of technical data to achieve interoperability. The original vendors may provide such technical data to others, often in the name of &quot;encouraging competition&quot;, but such data is invariably encumbered, and may be of limited use. Availability of such data is &quot;not&quot; equivalent to an open standard, because:
# The data is provided by the original vendor on a discretionary basis, and the vendor has every interest in blocking the effective implementation of competing solutions, and may subtly alter or change its product, often in newer revisions, so that competitors&#x27; implementations are almost, but not quite completely interoperable, leading customers to consider them unreliable or of lower quality. These changes may not be passed on to other vendors at all, or passed on after a strategic delay, maintaining the market dominance of the original vendor.
# The data itself may be encumbered, e.g. by patents or pricing, leading to a dependence of all competing solutions on the original vendor, and possibly leading a revenue stream from the competitors&#x27; customers back to the original vendor. This revenue stream is the result of the original product&#x27;s market dominance and not a result of any innate superiority.
# Even when the original vendor is genuinely interested in promoting a healthy competition (so that he may also benefit from the resulting innovative market), post-facto interoperability may often be undesirable as many defects or quirks can be directly traced back to the original implementation&#x27;s technical limitations. Although in an open process, anyone may identify and correct such limitations, and the resulting cleaner specification may be used by all vendors, this is more difficult post-facto, as customers already have valuable information and processes encoded in the faulty but dominant product, and other vendors are forced to replicate those faults and quirks for the sake of preserving interoperability even if they could design better solutions. Alternatively, it can be argued that even open processes are subject to the weight of past implementations and imperfect past designs and that the power of the dominant vendor to unilaterally correct or improve the system and impose the changes to all users facilitates innovation.
# Lack of an open standard can also become problematic for the customers, as in the case of the original vendor&#x27;s inability to fix a certain problem that is an artifact of technical limitations in the original product. The customer wants that fault fixed, but the vendor has to maintain that faulty state, even across newer revisions of the same product, because that behavior is a de facto standard and many more customers would have to pay the price of any interoperability issues caused by fixing the original problem and introducing new behavior.

== Government ==

=== eGovernment ===
Speaking from an e-government perspective, interoperability refers to the collaboration ability of cross-border services for citizens, businesses and public administrations. Exchanging data can be a challenge due to language barriers, different specifications of formats, varieties of categorizations and other hindrances.

If data is interpreted differently, collaboration is limited, takes longer and is inefficient. For instance, if a citizen of country A wants to purchase land in country B, the person will be asked to submit the proper address data. Address data in both countries include full name details, street name and number as well as a postal code. The order of the address details might vary. In the same language, it is not an obstacle to order the provided address data; but across language barriers, it becomes difficult. If the language uses a different writing system it is almost impossible if no translation tools are available.

=== Flood risk management ===
Interoperability is used by researchers in the context of urban flood risk management.  Cities and urban areas worldwide are expanding, which creates complex spaces with many interactions between the environment, infrastructure and people.  To address this complexity and manage water in urban areas appropriately, a system of systems approach to water and flood control is necessary. In this context, interoperability is important to facilitate system-of-systems thinking, and is defined as: &quot;the ability of any water management system to redirect water and make use of other system(s) to maintain or enhance its performance function during water exceedance events.&quot; By assessing the complex properties of urban infrastructure systems, particularly the interoperability between the drainage systems and other urban systems (e.g. infrastructure such as transport), it could be possible to expand the capacity of the overall system to manage flood water towards achieving improved urban flood resilience.

===Military forces===

&quot;Force interoperability&quot; is defined in NATO as the ability of the forces of two or more nations to train, exercise and operate effectively together in the execution of assigned missions and tasks. Additionally NATO defines interoperability more generally as the ability to act together coherently, effectively and efficiently to achieve Allied tactical, operational and strategic objectives.

At the strategic level, interoperability is an enabler for coalition building. It facilitates meaningful contributions by coalition partners. At this level, interoperability issues center on harmonizing world views, strategies, doctrines, and force structures. Interoperability is an element of coalition willingness to work together over the long term to achieve and maintain shared interests against common threats. Interoperability at the operational and tactical levels is where strategic interoperability and technological interoperability come together to help allies shape the environment, manage crises, and win wars. The benefits of interoperability at the operational and tactical levels generally derive from the interchangeability of force elements and units. &quot;Technological interoperability&quot; reflects the interfaces between organizations and systems. It focuses on communications and computers but also involves the technical capabilities of systems and the resulting mission compatibility between the systems and data of coalition partners. At the technological level, the benefits of interoperability come primarily from their impacts at the operational and tactical levels in terms of enhancing flexibility.
===Public safety===
Because first responders need to be able to communicate during wide-scale emergencies, interoperability is an important issue for law enforcement, fire fighting, emergency medical services, and other public health and safety departments. It has been a major area of investment and research over the last 12 years. Widely disparate and incompatible hardware impedes the exchange of information between agencies. Agencies&#x27; information systems such as computer-aided dispatch systems and records management systems functioned largely in isolation, in so-called &quot;information islands&quot;. Agencies tried to bridge this isolation with inefficient, stop-gap methods while large agencies began implementing limited interoperable systems. These approaches were inadequate and, in the US, the lack of interoperability in the public safety realm become evident during the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center structures. Further evidence of a lack of interoperability surfaced when agencies tackled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

In contrast to the overall national picture, some states, including Utah, have already made great strides forward. The Utah Highway Patrol and other departments in Utah have created a statewide data sharing network.

The Commonwealth of Virginia is one of the leading states in the United States in improving interoperability. The Interoperability Coordinator leverages a regional structure to better allocate grant funding around the Commonwealth so that all areas have an opportunity to improve communications interoperability. Virginia&#x27;s strategic plan for communications is updated yearly to include new initiatives for the Commonwealth – all projects and efforts are tied to this plan, which is aligned with the National Emergency Communications Plan, authored by the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Office of Emergency Communications.

The State of Washington seeks to enhance interoperability statewide. The State Interoperability Executive Committee (SIEC), established by the legislature in 2003, works to assist emergency responder agencies (police, fire, sheriff, medical, hazmat, etc.) at all levels of government (city, county, state, tribal, federal) to define interoperability for their local region. 
Washington recognizes that collaborating on system design and development for wireless radio systems enables emergency responder agencies to efficiently provide additional services, increase interoperability, and reduce long-term costs. This work saves the lives of emergency personnel and the citizens they serve.

The U.S. government is making an effort to overcome the nation&#x27;s lack of public safety interoperability. The Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Office for Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC) is pursuing the SAFECOM and CADIP and Project 25 programs, which are designed to help agencies as they integrate their CAD and other IT systems.

The OIC launched CADIP in August 2007. This project will partner the OIC with agencies in several locations, including Silicon Valley. This program will use case studies to identify the best practices and challenges associated with linking CAD systems across jurisdictional boundaries. These lessons will create the tools and resources public safety agencies can use to build interoperable CAD systems and communicate across local, state, and federal boundaries.

=== As regulator for interoperability ===
Governance entities can increase interoperability through their legislative and executive powers. For instance, in 2021 the European Commission, after commissioning two impact assessment studies and a technology analysis study, proposed the implementation of a standardization – for iterations of USB-C – of phone charger products, which may increase interoperability along with convergence and convenience for consumers while decreasing resource needs, redundancy and electronic waste.

== Commerce and industries ==

=== Information technology and computers ===

====Desktop====
Desktop interoperability is a subset of software interoperability. In the early days, the focus of interoperability was to integrate web applications with other web applications. Over time, open-system containers were developed to create a virtual desktop environment in which these applications could be registered and then communicate with each other using simple publish–subscribe patterns. Rudimentary UI capabilities were also supported allowing windows to be grouped with other windows. Today, desktop interoperability has evolved into full-service platforms which include container support, basic exchange between web and web, but also native support for other application types and advanced window management. The very latest interop platforms also include application services such as universal search, notifications, user permissions and preferences, 3rd party application connectors and language adapters for in-house applications.

====Information search====
Search interoperability refers to the ability of two or more information collections to be searched by a single query.

Specifically related to web-based search, the challenge of interoperability stems from the fact designers of web resources typically have little or no need to concern themselves with exchanging information with other web resources. Federated Search technology, which does not place format requirements on the data owner, has emerged as one solution to search interoperability challenges. In addition, standards, such as Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting, Resource Description Framework, and SPARQL, have emerged that also help address the issue of search interoperability related to web resources. Such standards also address broader topics of interoperability, such as allowing data mining.

==== Software ====

With respect to software, the term &quot;interoperability&quot; is used to describe the capability of different programs to exchange data via a common set of exchange formats, to read and write the same file formats, and to use the same communication protocols. The lack of interoperability can be a consequence of a lack of attention to standardization during the design of a program. Indeed, interoperability is not taken for granted in the non-standards-based portion of the computing world.

According to ISO/IEC 2382-01, &quot;Information Technology Vocabulary, Fundamental Terms&quot;, interoperability is defined as follows: &quot;The capability to communicate, execute programs, or transfer data among various functional units in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those units&quot;.

Standards-developing organizations provide open public software specifications to facilitate interoperability; examples include the Oasis-Open organization and buildingSMART (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability). Another example of a neutral party is the RFC documents from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

The Open Service for Lifecycle Collaboration community is working on finding a common standard in order that software tools can share and exchange data e.g. bugs, tasks, requirements etc. The final goal is to agree on an open standard for interoperability of open source application lifecycle management tools.

Java is an example of an interoperable programming language that allows for programs to be written once and run anywhere with a Java virtual machine. A program in Java, so long as it does not use system-specific functionality, will maintain interoperability with all systems that have a Java virtual machine available. Applications will maintain compatibility because, while the implementation is different, the underlying language interfaces are the same.

===== Achieving software =====
Software interoperability is achieved through five interrelated ways:
# Product testing
#: Products produced to a common standard, or to a sub-profile thereof, depend on the clarity of the standards, but there may be discrepancies in their implementations that system or unit testing may not uncover. This requires that systems formally be tested in a production scenario – as they will be finally implemented – to ensure they actually will intercommunicate as advertised, i.e. they are interoperable. Interoperable product testing is different from conformance-based product testing as conformance to a standard does not necessarily engender interoperability with another product which is also tested for conformance.
# Product engineering
#: Implements the common standard, or a sub-profile thereof, as defined by the industry and community partnerships with the specific intention of achieving interoperability with other software implementations also following the same standard or sub-profile thereof.
# Industry and community partnership
#: Industry and community partnerships, either domestic or international, sponsor standard workgroups with the purpose of defining a common standard that may be used to allow software systems to intercommunicate for a defined purpose. At times an industry or community will sub-profile an existing standard produced by another organization to reduce options and thus make interoperability more achievable for implementations.
# Common technology and intellectual property
#: The use of a common technology or intellectual property may speed up and reduce the complexity of interoperability by reducing variability between components from different sets of separately developed software products and thus allowing them to intercommunicate more readily. This technique has some of the same technical results as using a common vendor product to produce interoperability. The common technology can come through third-party libraries or open-source developments.
# Standard implementation
#: Software interoperability requires a common agreement that is normally arrived at via an industrial, national or international standard.

Each of these has an important role in reducing variability in intercommunication software and enhancing a common understanding of the end goal to be achieved.

==== Unified interoperability ====
===Market dominance and power ===
Interoperability tends to be regarded as an issue for experts and its implications for daily living are sometimes underrated. The European Union Microsoft competition case shows how interoperability concerns important questions of power relationships. In 2004, the European Commission found that Microsoft had abused its market power by deliberately restricting interoperability between Windows work group servers and non-Microsoft work group servers. By doing so, Microsoft was able to protect its dominant market position for work group server operating systems, the heart of corporate IT networks. Microsoft was ordered to disclose complete and accurate interface documentation, which could enable rival vendors to compete on an equal footing (&quot;the interoperability remedy&quot;).

Interoperability has also surfaced in the software patent debate in the European Parliament (June–July 2005). Critics claim that because patents on techniques required for interoperability are kept under RAND (reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing) conditions, customers will have to pay license fees twice: once for the product and, in the appropriate case, once for the patent-protected program the product uses.

===Business processes===
Interoperability is often more of an organizational issue. Interoperability can have a significant impact on the organizations concerned, raising issues of ownership (do people want to share their data? or are they dealing with information silos?), labor relations (are people prepared to undergo training?) and usability. In this context, a more apt definition is captured in the term &quot;business process interoperability&quot;.

Interoperability can have important economic consequences; for example, research has estimated the cost of inadequate interoperability in the US capital facilities industry to be $15.8 billion a year. If competitors&#x27; products are not interoperable (due to causes such as patents, trade secrets or coordination failures), the result may well be monopoly or market failure. For this reason, it may be prudent for user communities or governments to take steps to encourage interoperability in various situations. At least 30 international bodies and countries have implemented eGovernment-based interoperability framework initiatives called e-GIF while in the US there is the NIEM initiative.

===Medical industry===
The need for &quot;plug-and-play&quot; interoperability – the ability to take a medical device out of its box and easily make it work with one&#x27;s other devices – has attracted great attention from both healthcare providers and industry.

Increasingly, medical devices like incubators and imaging systems feature software that integrates at the point of care and with electronic systems, such as electronic medical records. At the 2016 Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS) meeting, experts in the field like Angela N. Johnson with GE Healthcare and Jeff Shuren of the United States Food and Drug Administration provided practical seminars on how companies developing new medical devices, and hospitals installing them, can work more effectively to align interoperable software systems.

=== Railways ===
Railways have greater or lesser interoperability depending on conforming to standards of gauge, couplings, brakes, signalling, loading gauge, and structure gauge to mention a few parameters. For passenger rail service, different railway platform height and width clearance standards may also affect interoperability.

North American freight and intercity passenger railroads are highly interoperable, but systems in Europe, Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and Australia are much less so. The parameter most difficult to overcome (at reasonable cost) is incompatibility of gauge, though variable gauge axle systems are increasingly used.

=== Telecommunications ===
In telecommunications, the term can be defined as:
#The ability to provide services to and accept services from other systems, and to use the services exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together. ITU-T provides standards for international telecommunications. 
#The condition achieved among communications-electronics systems or items of communications-electronics equipment when information or services can be exchanged directly and satisfactorily between them or their users. The degree of interoperability should be defined when referring to specific cases.

In two-way radio, interoperability is composed of three dimensions:
* compatible communications paths (compatible frequencies, equipment and signaling),
* radio system coverage or adequate signal strength, and;
* scalable capacity.

==Organizations dedicated to interoperability==
Many organizations are dedicated to interoperability. Some concentrate on eGovernment, eBusiness or data exchange in general.

===Global===
Internationally, Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium facilitates global interoperability across borders, language and technical barriers. In the built environment, the International Alliance for Interoperability started in 1994, and was renamed buildingSMART in 2005.

===Europe===
In Europe, the European Commission and its IDABC program issue the European Interoperability Framework. IDABC was succeeded by the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) program. They also initiated the Semantic Interoperability Centre Europe (SEMIC.EU). A European Land Information Service (EULIS) was established in 2006, as a consortium of European National Land Registers. The aim of the service is to establish a single portal through which customers are provided with access to information about individual properties, about land and property registration services, and about the associated legal environment.

The European Interoperability Framework (EIF) considered four kinds of interoperability: legal interoperability, organizational interoperability, semantic interoperability, and technical interoperability.

In the European Research Cluster on the Internet of Things (IERC) and IoT Semantic Interoperability Best Practices; four kinds of interoperability are distinguished: syntactical interoperability, technical interoperability, semantic interoperability, and organizational interoperability.

===US===
In the United States, the General Services Administration Component Organization and Registration Environment (CORE.GOV) initiative provided a collaboration environment for component development, sharing, registration, and reuse in the early 2000s. A related initiative is the ongoing National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) work and component repository. The National Institute of Standards and Technology serves as an agency for measurement standards.

<doc id="41287" wikidata="Q2166055" url="?curid=41287" title="Intersymbol interference">
<text>In telecommunications, intersymbol interference (ISI) is a form of distortion of a signal in which one symbol interferes with subsequent symbols. This is an unwanted phenomenon as the previous symbols have a similar effect as noise, thus making the communication less reliable. The spreading of the pulse beyond its allotted time interval causes it to interfere with neighboring pulses. ISI is usually caused by multipath propagation or the inherent linear or non-linear frequency response of a communication channel causing successive symbols to blur together.

The presence of ISI in the system introduces errors in the decision device at the receiver output. Therefore, in the design of the transmitting and receiving filters, the objective is to minimize the effects of ISI, and thereby deliver the digital data to its destination with the smallest error rate possible.

Ways to alleviate intersymbol interference include adaptive equalization and error correcting codes.

== Causes ==

=== Multipath propagation ===

One of the causes of intersymbol interference is multipath propagation in which a wireless signal from a transmitter reaches the receiver via multiple paths. The causes of this include reflection (for instance, the signal may bounce off buildings), refraction (such as through the foliage of a tree) and atmospheric effects such as atmospheric ducting and ionospheric reflection. Since the various paths can be of different lengths, this results in the different versions of the signal arriving at the receiver at different times. These delays mean that part or all of a given symbol will be spread into the subsequent symbols, thereby interfering with the correct detection of those symbols. Additionally, the various paths often distort the amplitude and/or phase of the signal, thereby causing further interference with the received signal.

=== Bandlimited channels ===

Another cause of intersymbol interference is the transmission of a signal through a bandlimited channel, i.e., one where the frequency response is zero above a certain frequency (the cutoff frequency). Passing a signal through such a channel results in the removal of frequency components above this cutoff frequency. In addition, components of the frequency below the cutoff frequency may also be attenuated by the channel.

This filtering of the transmitted signal affects the shape of the pulse that arrives at the receiver. The effects of filtering a rectangular pulse not only change the shape of the pulse within the first symbol period, but it is also spread out over the subsequent symbol periods. When a message is transmitted through such a channel, the spread pulse of each individual symbol will interfere with following symbols.

Bandlimited channels are present in both wired and wireless communications. The limitation is often imposed by the desire to operate multiple independent signals through the same area/cable; due to this, each system is typically allocated a piece of the total bandwidth available. For wireless systems, they may be allocated a slice of the electromagnetic spectrum to transmit in (for example, FM radio is often broadcast in the 87.5–108 MHz range). This allocation is usually administered by a government agency; in the case of the United States this is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In a wired system, such as an optical fiber cable, the allocation will be decided by the owner of the cable.

The bandlimiting can also be due to the physical properties of the medium - for instance, the cable being used in a wired system may have a cutoff frequency above which practically none of the transmitted signal will propagate.

Communication systems that transmit data over bandlimited channels usually implement pulse shaping to avoid interference caused by the bandwidth limitation. If the channel frequency response is flat and the shaping filter has a finite bandwidth, it is possible to communicate with no ISI at all. Often the channel response is not known beforehand, and an adaptive equalizer is used to compensate the frequency response.

== Effects on eye patterns ==
One way to study ISI in a PCM or data transmission system experimentally is to apply the received wave to the vertical deflection plates of an oscilloscope and to apply a sawtooth wave at the transmitted symbol rate R (R = 1/T) to the horizontal deflection plates. The resulting display is called an eye pattern because of its resemblance to the human eye for binary waves. The interior region of the eye pattern is called the eye opening. An eye pattern provides a great deal of information about the performance of the pertinent system.
# The width of the eye opening defines the time interval over which the received wave can be sampled without error from ISI. It is apparent that the preferred time for sampling is the instant of time at which the eye is open widest.
# The sensitivity of the system to timing error is determined by the rate of closure of the eye as the sampling time is varied.
# The height of the eye opening, at a specified sampling time, defines the margin over noise.

An eye pattern, which overlays many samples of a signal, can give a graphical representation of the
signal characteristics. The first image above is the eye pattern for a binary phase-shift keying (PSK) system in which a one is represented by an amplitude of −1 and a zero by an amplitude of +1. The current sampling time is at the center of the image and the previous and next sampling times are at the edges of the image. The various transitions from one sampling time to another (such as one-to-zero, one-to-one and so forth) can clearly be seen on the diagram.

The noise margin - the amount of noise required to cause the receiver to get an error - is given by the distance between the signal and the zero amplitude point at the sampling time; in other words, the further from zero at the sampling time the signal is the better. For the signal to be correctly interpreted, it must be sampled somewhere between the two points where the zero-to-one and one-to-zero transitions cross. Again, the further apart these points are the better, as this means the signal will be less sensitive to errors in the timing of the samples at the receiver.

The effects of ISI are shown in the second image which is an eye pattern of the same system when operating over a multipath channel. The effects of receiving delayed and distorted versions of the signal can be seen in the loss of definition of the signal transitions. It also reduces both the noise margin and the window in which the signal can be sampled, which shows that the performance of the system will be worse (i.e. it will have a greater bit error ratio).

== Countering ISI ==

There are several techniques in telecommunications and data storage that try to work around the problem of intersymbol interference.

* Design systems such that the impulse response is short enough that very little energy from one symbol smears into the next symbol.
* Separate symbols in time with guard periods.
* Apply an equalizer at the receiver, that, broadly speaking, attempts to undo the effect of the channel by applying an inverse filter.
* Apply a sequence detector at the receiver, that attempts to estimate the sequence of transmitted symbols using the Viterbi algorithm.

== Intentional intersymbol interference ==
Coded modulation systems also exist that intentionally build a controlled amount of ISI into the system at the transmitter side, known as faster-than-Nyquist signaling. Such a design trades a computational complexity penalty at the receiver against a Shannon capacity gain of the overall transceiver system.
