<text>Clostridium botulinum is a gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic, spore-forming, motile bacterium with the ability to produce botulinum toxin, which is a neurotoxin.

&quot;C. botulinum&quot; is a diverse group of pathogenic bacteria. Initially, they were grouped together by their ability to produce botulinum toxin and are now known as four distinct groups, &quot;C. botulinum&quot; groups I–IV. Along with some strains of &quot;Clostridium butyricum&quot; and &quot;Clostridium baratii&quot;, these bacteria all produce the toxin.

Botulinum toxin can cause botulism, a severe flaccid paralytic disease in humans and other animals, and is the most potent toxin known to science, natural or synthetic, with a lethal dose of 1.3–2.1 ng/kg in humans.

&quot;C. botulinum&quot; is commonly associated with bulging canned food; bulging, misshapen cans can be due to an internal increase in pressure caused by gas produced by bacteria.

&quot;C. botulinum&quot; is responsible for foodborne botulism (ingestion of preformed toxin), infant botulism (intestinal infection with toxin-forming &quot;C. botulinum&quot;), and wound botulism (infection of a wound with &quot;C. botulinum&quot;). &quot;C. botulinum&quot; produces heat-resistant endospores that are commonly found in soil and are able to survive under adverse conditions.

==Microbiology==

&quot;C. botulinum &quot;is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming bacterium. It is an obligate anaerobe, requiring an environment that lacks oxygen. However, &quot;C. botulinum&quot; tolerates traces of oxygen due to the enzyme superoxide dismutase, which is an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen. &quot;C. botulinum&quot; is able to produce the neurotoxin only during sporulation, which can happen only in an anaerobic environment.

&quot;C. botulinum&quot; is divided into four distinct phenotypic groups (I-IV) and is also classified into seven serotypes (A–G) based on the antigenicity of the botulinum toxin produced. On the level visible to DNA sequences, the phenotypic grouping matches the results of whole-genome and rRNA analyses, and setotype grouping approximates the result of analyses focused specifically on the toxin sequence. The two phylogenetic trees do not match because of the ability of the toxin gene cluster to be horizontally transferred.

=== Serotypes ===

Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) production is the unifying feature of the species. Seven serotypes of toxins have been identified that are allocated a letter (A–G), several of which can cause disease in humans. They are resistant to degradation by enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract. This allows for ingested toxins to be absorbed from the intestines into the bloodstream. Toxins can be further differentiated into subtypes on the bases of smaller variations.
However, all types of botulinum toxin are rapidly destroyed by heating to 100 °C for 15 minutes (900 seconds). 80 °C for 30 minutes also destroys BoNT.

Most strains produce one type of BoNT, but strains producing multiple toxins have been described. &quot;C. botulinum&quot; producing B and F toxin types have been isolated from human botulism cases in New Mexico and California. The toxin type has been designated Bf as the type B toxin was found in excess to the type F. Similarly, strains producing Ab and Af toxins have been reported.

Evidence indicates the neurotoxin genes have been the subject of horizontal gene transfer, possibly from a viral (bacteriophage) source. This theory is supported by the presence of integration sites flanking the toxin in some strains of &quot;C. botulinum&quot;. However, these integrations sites are degraded (except for the C and D types), indicating that the &quot;C. botulinum&quot; acquired the toxin genes quite far in the evolutionary past. Nevertheless, further transfers still happen via the plasmids and other mobile elements the genes are located on.

==== Toxin types in disease ====
Only botulinum toxin types A, B, E, F and H (FA) cause disease in humans. Types A, B, and E are associated with food-borne illness, while type E is specifically associated with fish products. Type C produces limber-neck in birds and type D causes botulism in other mammals. No disease is associated with type G. The &quot;gold standard&quot; for determining toxin type is a mouse bioassay, but the genes for types A, B, E, and F can now be readily differentiated using quantitative PCR. Type &quot;H&quot; is in fact a recombinant toxin from types A and F. It can be neutralized by type A antitoxin and no longer is considered a distinct type.

A few strains from organisms genetically identified as other &quot;Clostridium&quot; species have caused human botulism: &quot;C. butyricum&quot; has produced type E toxin and &quot;C. baratii&quot; had produced type F toxin. The ability of &quot;C. botulinum&quot; to naturally transfer neurotoxin genes to other clostridia is concerning, especially in the food industry, where preservation systems are designed to destroy or inhibit only &quot;C. botulinum&quot; but not other &quot;Clostridium&quot; species.

=== Metabolism ===
Many &quot;C. botulinum&quot; genes play a role in the breakdown of essential carbohydrates and the metabolism of sugars. Chitin is the preferred source of carbon and nitrogen for &quot;C. botulinum&quot;. Hall A strain of &quot;C. botulinum&quot; has an active chitinolytic system to aid in the breakdown of chitin. Type A and B of &quot;C. botulinum&quot; production of BoNT is affected by nitrogen and carbon nutrition. There is evidence that these processes are also under catabolite repression.

=== Groups ===
Physiological differences and genome sequencing at 16S rRNA level support the subdivision of the &quot;C. botulinum&quot; species into groups I-IV. Some authors have briefly used groups V and VI, corresponding to toxin-producing &quot;C. baratii&quot; and &quot;C. butyricum&quot;. What used to be group IV is now &quot;C. argentinense&quot;.
Although group II cannot degrade native protein such as casein, coagulated egg white, and cooked meat particles, it is able to degrade gelatin.

Human botulism is predominantly caused by group I or II &quot;C. botulinum&quot;. Group III organisms mainly cause diseases in non-human animals.

===Laboratory isolation===
In the laboratory, &quot;C. botulinum&quot; is usually isolated in tryptose sulfite cycloserine (TSC) growth medium in an anaerobic environment with less than 2% oxygen. This can be achieved by several commercial kits that use a chemical reaction to replace O2 with CO2. &quot;C. botulinum&quot; (groups I through III) is a lipase-positive microorganism that grows between pH of 4.8 and 7.0 and cannot use lactose as a primary carbon source, characteristics important for biochemical identification.

=== Transmission and sporulation ===
The exact mechanism behind sporulation of &quot;C. botulinum&quot; is not known. Different strains of &quot;C. botulinum&quot; can be divided into three different groups, group I, II, and III, based on environmental conditions like heat resistance, temperature, and biome. Within each group, different strains will use different strategies to adapt to their environment to survive. Unlike other clostridial species, &quot;C. botulinum&quot; spores will sporulate as it enters the stationary phase. &quot;C. botulinum&quot; relies on quorum-sensing to initiate the sporulation process. &quot;C. botulinum&quot; spores are not found in human feces unless the individual has contracted botulism, but &quot;C. botulinum&quot; cannot spread from person to person.

=== Motility structures ===
The most common motility structure for &quot;C. botulinum&quot; is a flagellum. Though this structure is not found in all strains of &quot;C. botulinum&quot;, most produce peritrichous flagella. When comparing the different strains, there is also differences in the length of the flagella and how many are present on the cell.

==Growth conditions and prevention==
&quot;C. botulinum&quot; is a soil bacterium. The spores can survive in most environments and are very hard to kill. They can survive the temperature of boiling water at sea level, thus many foods are canned with a pressurized boil that achieves even higher temperatures, sufficient to kill the spores. This bacteria is widely distributed in nature and can be assumed to be present on all food surfaces. Its optimum growth temperature is within the mesophilic range. In spore form, it is a heat resistant pathogen that can survive in low acid foods and grow to produce toxins. The toxin attacks the nervous system and will kill an adult at a dose of around 75 ng. Botulinum toxin can be destroyed by holding food at 100 °C for 10 minutes; however, because of its potency, this is not recommended by the USA&#x27;s FDA as a means of control.

Botulism poisoning can occur due to preserved or home-canned, low-acid food that was not processed using correct preservation times and/or pressure. Growth of the bacterium can be prevented by high acidity, high ratio of dissolved sugar, high levels of oxygen, very low levels of moisture, or storage at temperatures below 3 °C (38 °F) for type A. For example, in a low-acid, canned vegetable such as green beans that are not heated enough to kill the spores (i.e., a pressurized environment) may provide an oxygen-free medium for the spores to grow and produce the toxin. However, pickles are sufficiently acidic to prevent growth; even if the spores are present, they pose no danger to the consumer.

Honey, corn syrup, and other sweeteners may contain spores, but the spores cannot grow in a highly concentrated sugar solution; however, when a sweetener is diluted in the low-oxygen, low-acid digestive system of an infant, the spores can grow and produce toxin. As soon as infants begin eating solid food, the digestive juices become too acidic for the bacterium to grow.

The control of food-borne botulism caused by &quot;C. botulinum&quot; is based almost entirely on thermal destruction (heating) of the spores or inhibiting spore germination into bacteria and allowing cells to grow and produce toxins in foods. Conditions conducive of growth are dependent on various environmental factors.
Growth of &quot;C. botulinum&quot; is a risk in low acid foods as defined by having a pH above 4.6 although growth is significantly retarded for pH below 4.9.

==Taxonomic history==

&quot;C. botulinum&quot; was first recognized and isolated in 1895 by Emile van Ermengem from home-cured ham implicated in a botulism outbreak. The isolate was originally named &quot;Bacillus botulinus&quot;, after the Latin word for sausage, &quot;botulus&quot;. (&quot;Sausage poisoning&quot; was a common problem in 18th- and 19th-century Germany, and was most likely caused by botulism.) However, isolates from subsequent outbreaks were always found to be anaerobic spore formers, so Ida A. Bengtson proposed that both be placed into the genus &quot;Clostridium&quot;, as the genus &quot;Bacillus&quot; was restricted to aerobic spore-forming rods.

Since 1959, all species producing the botulinum neurotoxins (types A–G) have been designated &quot;C. botulinum&quot;. Substantial phenotypic and genotypic evidence exists to demonstrate heterogeneity within the species, with at least four clearly-defined &quot;groups&quot; (see ) straddling other species, implying that they each deserve to be a genospecies.

The situation as of 2018 is as follows:

* &quot;C. botulinum&quot; type G (= group IV) strains are since 1988 their own species, &quot;C. argentinense&quot;.
* Group I &quot;C. botulinum&quot; strains that do not produce a botulin toxin are referred to as &quot;C. sporogenes&quot;. Both names are conserved names since 1999. Group I also contains &quot;C. combesii&quot;.
* All other botulinum toxin-producing bacteria, not otherwise classified as &quot;C. baratii&quot; or &quot;C. butyricum&quot;, is called &quot;C. botulinum&quot;. This group still contains three genogroups.

Smith &quot;et al.&quot; (2018) argues that group I should be called &quot;C. parabotulinum&quot; and group III be called &quot;C. novyi&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot;, leaving only group II in &quot;C. botulinum&quot;. This argument is not accepted by the LPSN and would cause an unjustified change of the type strain under the Prokaryotic Code. (The current type strain ATCC 25763 falls into group I.) Dobritsa &quot;et al.&quot; (2018) argues, without formal descriptions, that group II can potentially be made into two new species.

The complete genome of &quot;C. botulinum&quot; ATCC 3502 has been sequenced at Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in 2007. This strain encodes a type &quot;A&quot; toxin.

== Diagnosis ==
Physicians may consider the diagnosis of botulism based on a patient&#x27;s clinical presentation, which classically includes an acute onset of bilateral cranial neuropathies and symmetric descending weakness. Other key features of botulism include an absence of fever, symmetric neurologic deficits, normal or slow heart rate and normal blood pressure, and no sensory deficits except for blurred vision. A careful history and physical examination is paramount to diagnose the type of botulism, as well as to rule out other conditions with similar findings, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome, stroke, and myasthenia gravis. Depending on the type of botulism considered, different tests for diagnosis may be indicated.
* Foodborne botulism: serum analysis for toxins by bioassay in mice should be done, as the demonstration of the toxins is diagnostic.
* Wound botulism: isolation of &quot;C. botulinum&quot; from the wound site should be attempted, as growth of the bacteria is diagnostic.
* Adult enteric and infant botulism: isolation and growth of &quot;C. botulinum&quot; from stool samples is diagnostic. Infant botulism is a diagnosis which is often missed in the emergency room.

Other tests that may be helpful in ruling out other conditions are:
* Electromyography (EMG) or antibody studies may help with the exclusion of myasthenia gravis and Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).
* Collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein and blood assist with the exclusion of Guillan-Barre syndrome and stroke.
* Detailed physical examination of the patient for any rash or tick presence helps with the exclusion of any tick transmitted tick paralysis.

== Pathology ==

=== Foodborne botulism ===
Signs and symptoms of foodborne botulism typically begin between 18 and 36 hours after the toxin gets into your body, but can range from a few hours to several days, depending on the amount of toxin ingested. Symptoms include:
* Double vision
* Blurred vision
* Ptosis
* Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps
* Slurred speech
* Trouble breathing
* Difficulty in swallowing
* Dry mouth
* Muscle weakness
* Constipation
* Reduced or absent deep tendon reactions, such as in the knee

===Wound botulism===
Most people who develop wound botulism inject drugs several times a day, so determining a timeline of when onset symptoms first occurred and when the toxin entered the body can be difficult. It is more common in people who inject black tar heroin. Wound botulism signs and symptoms include:
* Difficulty swallowing or speaking
* Facial weakness on both sides of the face
* Blurred or double vision
* Ptosis
* Trouble breathing
* Paralysis

===Infant botulism===
If infant botulism is related to food, such as honey, problems generally begin within 18 to 36 hours after the toxin enters the baby&#x27;s body. Signs and symptoms include:
* Constipation (often the first sign)
* Floppy movements due to muscle weakness and trouble controlling the head
* Weak cry
* Irritability
* Drooling
* Ptosis
* Tiredness
* Difficulty sucking or feeding
* Paralysis

===Beneficial effects of botulinum toxin===
Purified botulinum toxin is diluted by a physician for treatment of:
* Congenital pelvic tilt
* Spasmodic dysphasia (the inability of the muscles of the larynx)
* Achalasia (esophageal stricture)
* Strabismus (crossed eyes)
* Paralysis of the facial muscles
* Failure of the cervix
* Blinking frequently
* Anti-cancer drug delivery

===Adult intestinal toxemia===
A very rare form of botulism that occurs by the same route as infant botulism but is among adults. Occurs rarely and sporadically. Signs and symptoms include:
* Abdominal pain
* Blurred vision
* Diarrhea
* Dysarthria
* Imbalance
* Weakness in arms and hand area

== Treatment ==
In the case of a diagnosis or suspicion of botulism, patients should be hospitalized immediately, even if the diagnosis and/or tests are pending. Additionally if botulism is suspected, patients should be treated immediately with antitoxin therapy in order to reduce mortality. Immediate intubation is also highly recommended, as respiratory failure is the primary cause of death from botulism.

In North America, an equine-derived heptavalent botulinum antitoxin is used to treat all serotypes of non-infant naturally occurring botulism. For infants less than one year of age, botulism immune globulin is used to treat type A or type B.

Outcomes vary between one and three months, but with prompt interventions, mortality from botulism ranges from less than 5 percent to 8 percent.

== Vaccination ==
There used to be a formalin-treated toxoid vaccine against botulism (serotypes A-E), but it was discontinued in 2011 due to declining potency in the toxoid stock. It was originally intended for people at risk of exposure. A few new vaccines are under development.

== Use and detection ==
&quot;C. botulinum&quot; is used to prepare the medicaments Botox, Dysport, Xeomin, and Neurobloc used to selectively paralyze muscles to temporarily relieve muscle function. It has other &quot;off-label&quot; medical purposes, such as treating severe facial pain, such as that caused by trigeminal neuralgia.

Botulinum toxin produced by &quot;C. botulinum&quot; is often believed to be a potential bioweapon as it is so potent that it takes about 75 nanograms to kill a person ( of 1 ng/kg, assuming an average person weighs ~75 kg); 1 kilogram of it would be enough to kill the entire human population.

A &quot;mouse protection&quot; or &quot;mouse bioassay&quot; test determines the type of &quot;C. botulinum&quot; toxin present using monoclonal antibodies. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with digoxigenin-labeled antibodies can also be used to detect the toxin, and quantitative PCR can detect the toxin genes in the organism.

==&quot;C. botulinum&quot; in different geographical locations==
A number of quantitative surveys for &quot;C. botulinum&quot; spores in the environment have suggested a prevalence of specific toxin types in given geographic areas, which remain unexplained.

<text>Philip Arthur Larkin (9 August 1922 – 2 December 1985) was an English poet, novelist, and librarian. His first book of poetry, &quot;The North Ship&quot;, was published in 1945, followed by two novels, &quot;Jill&quot; (1946) and &quot;A Girl in Winter&quot; (1947). He came to prominence in 1955 with the publication of his second collection of poems, &quot;The Less Deceived&quot;, followed by &quot;The Whitsun Weddings&quot; (1964) and &quot;High Windows&quot; (1974). He contributed to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as its jazz critic from 1961 to 1971, with his articles gathered in &quot;All What Jazz: A Record Diary 1961–71&quot; (1985), and edited &quot;The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse&quot; (1973). His many honours include the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry. He was offered, but declined, the position of Poet Laureate in 1984, following the death of Sir John Betjeman.

After graduating from Oxford University in 1943 with a first in English Language and Literature, Larkin became a librarian. It was during the thirty years he worked with distinction as university librarian at the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull that he produced the greater part of his published work. His poems are marked by what Andrew Motion calls &quot;a very English, glum accuracy&quot; about emotions, places, and relationships, and what Donald Davie described as &quot;lowered sights and diminished expectations&quot;. Eric Homberger (echoing Randall Jarrell) called him &quot;the saddest heart in the post-war supermarket&quot;—Larkin himself said that deprivation for him was &quot;what daffodils were for Wordsworth&quot;. Influenced by W. H. Auden, W. B. Yeats, and Thomas Hardy, his poems are highly structured but flexible verse forms. They were described by Jean Hartley, the ex-wife of Larkin&#x27;s publisher George Hartley (the Marvell Press), as a &quot;piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent&quot;. Anthologist Keith Tuma writes that there is more to Larkin&#x27;s work than its reputation for dour pessimism suggests.
Larkin&#x27;s public persona was that of the no-nonsense, solitary Englishman who disliked fame and had no patience for the trappings of the public literary life. The posthumous publication by Anthony Thwaite in 1992 of his letters triggered controversy about his personal life and political views, described by John Banville as hair-raising but also in places hilarious. Lisa Jardine called him a &quot;casual, habitual racist, and an easy misogynist&quot;, but the academic John Osborne argued in 2008 that &quot;the worst that anyone has discovered about Larkin are some crass letters and a taste for porn softer than what passes for mainstream entertainment&quot;. Despite the controversy, Larkin was chosen in a 2003 Poetry Book Society survey, almost two decades after his death, as Britain&#x27;s best-loved poet of the previous 50 years, and in 2008 &quot;The Times&quot; named him Britain&#x27;s greatest post-war writer.

In 1973 a &quot;Coventry Evening Telegraph&quot; reviewer referred to Larkin as &quot;the bard of Coventry&quot;, but in 2010, 25 years after his death, it was Larkin&#x27;s adopted home city, Kingston upon Hull, that commemorated him with the Larkin 25 Festival, which culminated in the unveiling of a statue of Larkin by Martin Jennings on 2 December 2010, the 25th anniversary of his death. On 2 December 2016, the 31st anniversary of his death, a floor stone memorial for Larkin was unveiled at Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey.

==Life==
===Early life and education===

Philip Larkin was born on 9 August 1922 at 2 Poultney Road, Radford, Coventry, the only son and younger child of Sydney Larkin (1884–1948) and his wife Eva Emily (1886–1977), daughter of first-class excise officer William James Day. Sydney Larkin&#x27;s family originated in Kent, but had lived since at least the eighteenth century at Lichfield, Staffordshire, where they worked first as tailors, then also as coach-builders and shoe-makers. The Day family were from Epping, Essex, but moved to Leigh, Lancashire in 1914 where William Day took a post administering pensions and other dependent allowances.

Larkin&#x27;s family lived in the district of Radford, Coventry, until Larkin was five years old, before moving to a large three-storey middle-class house complete with servants&#x27; quarters near Coventry railway station and King Henry VIII School, in Manor Road. Having survived the bombings of the Second World War, their former house in Manor Road was demolished in the 1960s to make way for a road modernisation programme, the construction of an inner ring road. His sister Catherine, known as Kitty, was 10 years older than he was. 

His father, a self-made man who had risen to be Coventry City Treasurer, was a singular individual, &#x27;nihilistically disillusioned in middle age&#x27;, who combined a love of literature with an enthusiasm for Nazism, and had attended two Nuremberg rallies during the mid-1930s. He introduced his son to the works of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce and above all D. H. Lawrence. His mother was a nervous and passive woman, &quot;a kind of defective mechanism...Her ideal is &#x27;to collapse&#x27; and to be taken care of&quot;, dominated by her husband.
Larkin&#x27;s early childhood was in some respects unusual: he was educated at home until the age of eight by his mother and sister, neither friends nor relatives ever visited the family home, and he developed a stammer. When he joined Coventry&#x27;s King Henry VIII Junior School he fitted in immediately and made close, long-standing friendships, such as those with James &quot;Jim&quot; Sutton, Colin Gunner and Noel &quot;Josh&quot; Hughes. Although home life was relatively cold, Larkin enjoyed support from his parents. For example, his deep passion for jazz was supported by the purchase of a drum kit and a saxophone, supplemented by a subscription to &quot;DownBeat&quot;. From the junior school he progressed to King Henry VIII Senior School. He fared quite poorly when he sat his School Certificate exam at the age of 16. Despite his results, he was allowed to stay on at school. Two years later he earned distinctions in English and History, and passed the entrance exams for St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, to read English.

Larkin began at Oxford University in October 1940, a year after the outbreak of the Second World War. The old upper-class traditions of university life had, at least for the time being, faded, and most of the male students were studying for highly truncated degrees. Due to his poor eyesight, Larkin failed his military medical examination and was able to study for the usual three years. Through his tutorial partner, Norman Iles, he met Kingsley Amis, who encouraged his taste for ridicule and irreverence and who remained a close friend throughout Larkin&#x27;s life. 

Amis, Larkin and other university friends formed a group they dubbed &quot;The Seven&quot;, meeting to discuss each other&#x27;s poetry, listen to jazz, and drink enthusiastically. During this time he had his first real social interaction with the opposite sex, but made no romantic headway. In 1943 he sat his finals, and, having dedicated much of his time to his own writing, was greatly surprised at being awarded a first-class honours degree.

===Early career and relationships===
In 1943 Larkin was appointed librarian of the public library in Wellington, Shropshire. It was while working there that in early 1944 he met his first girlfriend, Ruth Bowman, an academically ambitious 16-year-old schoolgirl. In 1945, Ruth went to continue her studies at King&#x27;s College London; during one of his visits their friendship developed into a sexual relationship. By June 1946, Larkin was halfway through qualifying for membership of the Library Association and was appointed assistant librarian at University College, Leicester. It was visiting Larkin in Leicester and witnessing the university&#x27;s Senior Common Room that gave Kingsley Amis the inspiration to write &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; (1954), the novel that made Amis famous and to whose long gestation Larkin contributed considerably. Six weeks after his father&#x27;s death from cancer in March 1948, Larkin proposed to Ruth, and that summer the couple spent their annual holiday touring Hardy country.

In June 1950 Larkin was appointed sub-librarian at The Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, a post he took up that September. Before his departure he and Ruth split up. At some stage between the appointment to the position at Queen&#x27;s and the end of the engagement to Ruth, Larkin&#x27;s friendship with Monica Jones, a lecturer in English at Leicester, also developed into a sexual relationship. He spent five years in Belfast, which appear to have been the most contented of his life. While his relationship with Jones developed, he also had &quot;the most satisfyingly erotic [experience] of his life&quot; with Patsy Strang, who at the time was in an open marriage with one of his colleagues. 

At one stage she offered to leave her husband to marry Larkin. From 1951 onwards Larkin holidayed with Jones in various locations around the British Isles. While in Belfast he also had a significant though sexually undeveloped friendship with Winifred Arnott, the subject of &quot;Lines on a Young Lady&#x27;s Photograph Album&quot;, which came to an end when she married in 1954. This was the period in which he gave Kingsley Amis extensive advice on the writing of &quot;Lucky Jim&quot;. Amis repaid the debt by dedicating the finished book to Larkin.
In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held until his death. Professor R. L. Brett, who was chairman of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, &quot;At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again.&quot; For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem &quot;High Windows.&quot; 

Of the city itself Larkin commented: &quot;I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn&#x27;t really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I&#x27;ve lived in other places.&quot; 

In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university&#x27;s vice-chancellor.

One of Larkin&#x27;s colleagues at Hull said he became a great figure in post-war British librarianship. Ten years after the new library&#x27;s completion, Larkin computerized records for the entire library stock, making it the first library in Europe to install a Geac computer system, an automated online circulation system. Richard Goodman wrote that Larkin excelled as an administrator, committee man and arbitrator. &quot;He treated his staff decently, and he motivated them&quot;, Goodman said. &quot;He did this with a combination of efficiency, high standards, humour and compassion.&quot; He rejected the Net Book Agreement. From 1957 until his death, Larkin&#x27;s secretary was Betty Mackereth. All access to him by his colleagues was through her, and she came to know as much about Larkin&#x27;s compartmentalized life as anyone. During his 30 years there, the library&#x27;s stock sextupled, and the budget expanded from £4,500 to £448,500, in real terms a twelvefold increase.

===Later life===

In February 1961 Larkin&#x27;s friendship with his colleague Maeve Brennan became romantic, despite her strong Roman Catholic beliefs. In early 1963 Brennan persuaded him to go with her to a dance for university staff, despite his preference for smaller gatherings. This seems to have been a pivotal moment in their relationship, and he memorialised it in his longest (and unfinished) poem &quot;The Dance&quot;. Around this time, also at her prompting, Larkin learnt to drive and bought a car – his first, a Singer Gazelle. Meanwhile, Monica Jones, whose parents had died in 1959, bought a holiday cottage in Haydon Bridge, near Hexham, which she and Larkin visited regularly. His poem &quot;Show Saturday&quot; is a description of the 1973 Bellingham show in the North Tyne valley.

In 1964, following the publication of &quot;The Whitsun Weddings&quot;, Larkin was the subject of an edition of the arts programme &quot;Monitor&quot;, directed by Patrick Garland. The programme, which shows him being interviewed by fellow poet John Betjeman in a series of locations in and around Hull, allowed Larkin to play a significant part in the creation of his own public persona; one he would prefer his readers to imagine.

In 1968, Larkin was offered the OBE, which he declined. Later in life he accepted the offer of being made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour. In 1976, the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded Larkin its annual Shakespeare Prize in recognition of his life&#x27;s work.

Larkin&#x27;s role in the creation of Hull University&#x27;s new Brynmor Jones Library had been important and demanding. Soon after the completion of the second and larger phase of construction in 1969, he was able to redirect his energies. In October 1970, he started to work on compiling a new anthology, &quot;The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse&quot; (1973). He was awarded a Visiting Fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, for two academic terms, allowing him to consult Oxford&#x27;s Bodleian Library, a copyright library. While he was in Oxford he passed responsibility for the Library to his deputy, Brenda Moon. Larkin was a major contributor to the re-evaluation of the poetry of Thomas Hardy, which, in comparison to his novels, had been overlooked; in Larkin&#x27;s &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; and &quot;controversial&quot; anthology, Hardy was the poet most generously represented. There were twenty-seven poems by Hardy, compared with only nine by T. S. Eliot (however, Eliot is most famous for long poems); the other poets most extensively represented were W. B. Yeats, W. H. Auden and Rudyard Kipling. Larkin included six of his own poems—the same number as for Rupert Brooke. In the process of compiling the volume he had been disappointed not to find more and better poems as evidence that the clamour over the Modernists had stifled the voices of traditionalists. The most favourable responses to the anthology were those of Auden and John Betjeman, while the most hostile was that of Donald Davie, who accused Larkin of &quot;positive cynicism&quot; and of encouraging &quot;the perverse triumph of philistinism, the cult of the amateur ... [and] the weakest kind of Englishry&quot;. After an initial period of anxiety about the anthology&#x27;s reception, Larkin enjoyed the clamour.
In 1971, Larkin regained contact with his schoolfriend Colin Gunner, who had led a picaresque life. Their subsequent correspondence has gained notoriety as Larkin expressed right-wing views and used racist language. In the period from 1973 to 1974, Larkin became an Honorary Fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, and was awarded honorary degrees by Warwick, St Andrews and Sussex universities. In January 1974, Hull University informed Larkin that they were going to dispose of the building on Pearson Park in which he lived. Shortly afterwards he bought a detached two-storey 1950s house in Newland Park which was described by his university colleague John Kenyon as &quot;an entirely middle-class backwater&quot;. Larkin, who moved into the house in June, thought the four-bedroom property &quot;utterly undistinguished&quot; and reflected, &quot;I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the kind of dwelling that is eloquent of the nobility of the human spirit&quot;.

Shortly after splitting up with Maeve Brennan in August 1973, Larkin attended W. H. Auden&#x27;s memorial service at Christ Church, Oxford, with Monica Jones as his official partner. In March 1975, the relationship with Brennan restarted, and three weeks after this he initiated a secret affair with Betty Mackereth, who served as his secretary for 28 years, writing the long-undiscovered poem &quot;We met at the end of the party&quot; for her. Despite the logistical difficulties of having three relationships simultaneously, the situation continued until March 1978. From then on he and Jones were a monogamous couple.

In 1976, Larkin was the guest of Roy Plomley on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. His choice of music included &quot;Dallas Blues&quot; by Louis Armstrong, &quot;Spem in alium&quot; by Thomas Tallis and the Symphony No. 1 in A flat major by Edward Elgar. His favourite piece was &quot;I&#x27;m Down in the Dumps&quot; by Bessie Smith.

In December 2010, as part of the commemorations of the 25th anniversary of Larkin&#x27;s death, the BBC broadcast a programme entitled &quot;Philip Larkin and the Third Woman&quot; focusing on his affair with Mackereth in which she spoke for the first time about their relationship. It included a reading of a newly discovered secret poem, &quot;Dear Jake&quot;, and revealed that Mackereth was one of the inspirations for his writings.

===Final years and death===
Larkin turned sixty in 1982. This was marked most significantly by a collection of essays entitled &quot;Larkin at Sixty&quot;, edited by Anthony Thwaite and published by Faber and Faber. There were also two television programmes: an episode of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; presented by Melvyn Bragg in which Larkin made off-camera contributions, and a half-hour special on the BBC that was devised and presented by the Labour Shadow Cabinet Minister Roy Hattersley.

In 1983, Jones was hospitalised with shingles, a skin rash. The severity of her symptoms, including its effects on her eyes, distressed Larkin. As her health declined, regular care became necessary: within a month she moved into his Newland Park home and remained there for the rest of her life.
At the memorial service for John Betjeman, who died in July 1984, Larkin was asked if he would accept the post of Poet Laureate. He declined, not least because he felt he had long since ceased to be a writer of poetry in a meaningful sense. The following year, Larkin began to suffer from oesophageal cancer. On 11 June 1985, he underwent surgery, but his cancer was found to have spread and was inoperable. On 28 November, he collapsed and was readmitted to hospital. He died four days later, on 2 December 1985, at the age of 63, and was buried at Cottingham municipal cemetery near Hull.
Larkin had asked on his deathbed that his diaries be destroyed. The request was granted by Jones, the main beneficiary of his will, and Betty Mackereth; the latter shredded the unread diaries page by page, then had them burned. His will was found to be contradictory regarding his other private papers and unpublished work; legal advice left the issue to the discretion of his literary executors, who decided the material should not be destroyed. When she died on 15 February 2001, Jones, in turn, left £1 million split between St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Hexham Abbey and Durham Cathedral, and another £1 million to the National Trust. Larkin is commemorated with a green plaque on The Avenues, Kingston upon Hull.

==Creative output==
===Juvenilia and early works===
From his mid-teens, Larkin &quot;wrote ceaselessly&quot;, producing both poetry, initially modelled on Eliot and W. H. Auden, and fiction: he wrote five full-length novels, each of which he destroyed shortly after their completion. While he was at Oxford University, his first published poem, &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, appeared in &quot;The Listener&quot;. He developed a pseudonymous alter ego in this period for his prose: Brunette Coleman. Under this name he wrote two novellas, &quot;Trouble at Willow Gables&quot; and &quot;Michaelmas Term at St Brides&quot; (2002), as well as a supposed autobiography and an equally fictitious creative manifesto called &quot;What we are writing for&quot;. Richard Bradford has written that these curious works show &quot;three registers: cautious indifference, archly overwritten symbolism with a hint of Lawrence and prose that appears to disclose its writer&#x27;s involuntary feelings of sexual excitement&quot;.

After these works, Larkin began to write his first published novel &quot;Jill&quot; (1946). This was published by Reginald A. Caton, a publisher of barely legal pornography, who also issued serious fiction as a cover for his core activities. Around the time that &quot;Jill&quot; was being prepared for publication, Caton inquired of Larkin if he also wrote poetry. This resulted in the publication, three months before &quot;Jill&quot;, of &quot;The North Ship&quot; (1945), a collection of poems written between 1942 and 1944 which showed the increasing influence of Yeats. Immediately after completing &quot;Jill&quot;, Larkin started work on the novel &quot;A Girl in Winter&quot; (1947), completing it in 1945. This was published by Faber and Faber and was well received, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; calling it &quot;an exquisite performance and nearly faultless&quot;. Subsequently, he made at least three concerted attempts at writing a third novel, but none developed beyond a solid start.

===Mature works===

It was during Larkin&#x27;s five years in Belfast that he reached maturity as a poet. The bulk of his next published collection of poems, &quot;The Less Deceived&quot; (1955), was written there, though eight of the twenty-nine poems included were from the late 1940s. This period also saw Larkin make his final attempts at writing prose fiction, and he gave extensive help to Kingsley Amis with &quot;Lucky Jim&quot;, which was Amis&#x27;s first published novel. In October 1954 an article in &quot;The Spectator&quot; made the first use of the title The Movement to describe the dominant trend in British post-war literature. Poems by Larkin were included in a 1953 PEN Anthology that also featured poems by Amis and Robert Conquest, and Larkin was seen to be a part of this grouping. In 1951, Larkin compiled a collection called &quot;XX Poems&quot; which he had privately printed in a run of just 100 copies. Many of the poems in it subsequently appeared in his next published volume. 

In November 1955, &quot;The Less Deceived&quot;, was published by the Marvell Press, an independent company in Hessle near Hull (dated October). At first the volume attracted little attention, but in December it was included in &quot;The Times&quot;″ list of &quot;Books of the Year&quot;. From this point, the book&#x27;s reputation spread and sales blossomed throughout 1956 and 1957. During his first five years in Hull, the pressures of work slowed Larkin&#x27;s output to an average of just two-and-a-half poems a year, but this period saw the writing of some of his best-known poems, such as &quot;An Arundel Tomb&quot;, &quot;The Whitsun Weddings&quot; and &quot;Here&quot;.

In 1963, Faber and Faber reissued &quot;Jill&quot;, with the addition of a long introduction by Larkin that included much information about his time at Oxford University and his friendship with Kingsley Amis. This acted as a prelude to the publication the following year of &quot;The Whitsun Weddings&quot;, the volume which cemented his reputation; a Fellowship of the Royal Society of Literature was granted to Larkin almost immediately. In the years that followed, Larkin wrote several of his most best-known poems, followed in the 1970s by a series of longer and more sober poems, including &quot;The Building&quot; and &quot;The Old Fools&quot;. 

All of these appeared in Larkin&#x27;s final collection, &quot;High Windows&quot;, which was published in June 1974. Its more direct use of language meant that it did not meet with uniform praise; nonetheless it sold over twenty thousand copies in its first year alone. For some critics it represents a falling-off from his previous two books, yet it contains a number of his much-loved pieces, including &quot;This Be The Verse&quot; and &quot;The Explosion&quot;, as well as the title poem. &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot; (Year of Wonder), also from that volume, contains the frequently quoted observation that sexual intercourse began in 1963, which the narrator claims was &quot;rather late for me&quot;. Bradford, prompted by comments in Maeve Brennan&#x27;s memoir, suggests that the poem commemorates Larkin&#x27;s relationship with Brennan moving from the romantic to the sexual.

Later in 1974 he started work on his final major published poem, &quot;Aubade&quot;. It was completed in 1977 and published in 23 December issue of &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. After &quot;Aubade&quot; Larkin wrote only one poem that has attracted close critical attention, the posthumously published and intensely personal &quot;Love Again&quot;.

===Poetic style===

Larkin&#x27;s poetry has been characterized as combining &quot;an ordinary, colloquial style&quot;, &quot;clarity&quot;, a &quot;quiet, reflective tone&quot;, &quot;ironic understatement&quot; and a &quot;direct&quot; engagement with &quot;commonplace experiences&quot;, while Jean Hartley summed his style up as a &quot;piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent&quot;.

Larkin&#x27;s earliest work showed the influence of Eliot, Auden and Yeats, and the development of his mature poetic identity in the early 1950s coincided with the growing influence on him of Thomas Hardy. The &quot;mature&quot; Larkin style, first evident in &quot;The Less Deceived&quot;, is &quot;that of the detached, sometimes lugubrious, sometimes tender observer&quot;, who, in Hartley&#x27;s phrase, looks at &quot;ordinary people doing ordinary things&quot;. He disparaged poems that relied on &quot;shared classical and literary allusions – what he called &quot;the myth-kitty&quot;, and the poems are never cluttered with elaborate imagery.&quot; Larkin&#x27;s mature poetic persona is notable for its &quot;plainness and scepticism&quot;. Other recurrent features of his mature work are sudden openings and &quot;highly-structured but flexible verse forms&quot;.
Terence Hawkes has argued that while most of the poems in &quot;The North Ship&quot; are &quot;metaphoric in nature, heavily indebted to Yeats&#x27;s symbolist lyrics&quot;, the subsequent development of Larkin&#x27;s mature style is &quot;not ... a movement from Yeats to Hardy, but rather a surrounding of the Yeatsian moment (the metaphor) within a Hardyesque frame&quot;. In Hawkes&#x27;s view, &quot;Larkin&#x27;s poetry ... revolves around two losses&quot;: the &quot;loss of modernism&quot;, which manifests itself as &quot;the desire to find a moment of epiphany&quot;, and &quot;the loss of England, or rather the loss of the British Empire, which requires England to define itself in its own terms when previously it could define &#x27;Englishness&#x27; in opposition to something else.&quot;

In 1972, Larkin wrote the oft-quoted &quot;Going, Going&quot;, a poem which expresses a romantic fatalism in its view of England that was typical of his later years. In it he prophesies a complete destruction of the countryside, and expresses an idealised sense of national togetherness and identity: &quot;And that will be England gone ... it will linger on in galleries; but all that remains for us will be concrete and tyres&quot;. The poem ends with the blunt statement, &quot;I just think it will happen, soon.&quot;

Larkin&#x27;s style is bound up with his recurring themes and subjects, which include death and fatalism, as in his final major poem &quot;Aubade&quot;. Poet Andrew Motion observes of Larkin&#x27;s poems: &quot;their rage or contempt is always checked by the ... energy of their language and the satisfactions of their articulate formal control&quot;. Motion contrasts two aspects of his poetic personality—on the one hand, an enthusiasm for &quot;symbolist moments&quot; and &quot;freely imaginative narratives&quot;, and on the other a &quot;remorseless factuality&quot; and &quot;crudity of language&quot;. Motion defines this as a &quot;life-enhancing struggle between opposites&quot;, and concludes that his poetry is typically &quot;ambivalent&quot;: &quot;His three mature collections have developed attitudes and styles of ... imaginative daring: in their prolonged debates with despair, they testify to wide sympathies, contain passages of frequently transcendent beauty, and demonstrate a poetic inclusiveness which is of immense consequence for his literary heirs.&quot;

===Prose non-fiction===
Larkin was a critic of modernism in contemporary art and literature. His scepticism is at its most nuanced and illuminating in &quot;Required Writing&quot;, a collection of his book reviews and essays, and at its most inflamed and polemical in his introduction to his collected jazz reviews, &quot;All What Jazz&quot;, drawn from the 126 record-review columns he wrote for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; between 1961 and 1971, which contains an attack on modern jazz that widens into a wholesale critique of modernism in the arts. Larkin (not unwillingly) acquired a reputation as an enemy of modernism, but recent critical assessments of Larkin&#x27;s writings have identified them as possessing some modernist characteristics.

==Legacy==
===Reception history===

When first published in 1945, &quot;The North Ship&quot; received just one review, in the &quot;Coventry Evening Telegraph&quot;, which concluded &quot;Mr Larkin has an inner vision that must be sought for with care. His recondite imagery is couched in phrases that make up in a kind of wistful hinted beauty what they lack in lucidity. Mr Larkin&#x27;s readers must at present be confined to a small circle. Perhaps his work will gain wider appeal as his genius becomes more mature?&quot; A few years later, though, the poet and critic Charles Madge came across the book and wrote to Larkin with his compliments. When the collection was reissued in 1966, it was presented as a work of juvenilia, and the reviews were gentle and respectful; the most forthright praise came from Elizabeth Jennings in &quot;The Spectator&quot;: &quot;few will question the intrinsic value of &quot;The North Ship&quot; or the importance of its being reprinted now. It is good to know that Larkin could write so well when still so young.&quot;

&quot;The Less Deceived&quot; was first noticed by &quot;The Times&quot;, who included it in its &quot;List of Books of 1955&quot;. In its wake many other reviews followed; &quot;most of them concentrated ... on the book&#x27;s emotional impact and its sophisticated, witty language.&quot; &quot;The Spectator&quot; felt the collection was &quot;in the running for the best published in this country since the war&quot;; G. S. Fraser, referring to Larkin&#x27;s perceived association with The Movement felt that Larkin exemplified &quot;everything that is good in this &#x27;new movement&#x27; and none of its faults&quot;. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; called him &quot;a poet of quite exceptional importance&quot;. 

In June 1956, the &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot; was fulsome: &quot;As native as a Whitstable oyster, as sharp an expression of contemporary thought and experience as anything written in our time, as immediate in its appeal as the lyric poetry of an earlier day, it may well be regarded by posterity as a poetic monument that marks the triumph over the formless mystifications of the last twenty years. With Larkin poetry is on its way back to the middlebrow public.&quot; Reviewing the book in America, the poet Robert Lowell wrote: &quot;No post-war poetry has so caught the moment, and caught it without straining after its ephemera. It&#x27;s a hesitant, groping mumble, resolutely experienced, resolutely perfect in its artistic methods.&quot;

In time, there was a counter-reaction: David Wright wrote in &quot;Encounter&quot; that &quot;The Less Deceived&quot; suffered from the &quot;palsy of playing safe&quot;. In April 1957, Charles Tomlinson wrote a piece for the journal &quot;Essays in Criticism&quot;, &quot;The Middlebrow Muse&quot;, attacking The Movement&#x27;s poets for their &quot;middle-cum-lowbrowism&quot;, &quot;suburban mental ratio&quot; and &quot;parochialism&quot;—Larkin had a &quot;tenderly nursed sense of defeat&quot;. In 1962, A. Alvarez, the compiler of an anthology entitled &quot;The New Poetry&quot;, accused Larkin of &quot;gentility, neo-Georgian pastoralism, and a failure to deal with the violent extremes of contemporary life&quot;.
When &quot;The Whitsun Weddings&quot; was released, Alvarez continued his attacks in a review in &quot;The Observer&quot;, complaining of the &quot;drab circumspection&quot; of Larkin&#x27;s &quot;commonplace&quot; subject-matter. Praise outweighed criticism; John Betjeman felt Larkin had &quot;closed the gap between poetry and the public which the experiments and obscurity of the last fifty years have done so much to widen.&quot; In &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Christopher Ricks wrote of the &quot;refinement of self-consciousness, usually flawless in its execution&quot; and Larkin&#x27;s summoning up of &quot;the world of all of us, the place where, in the end, we find our happiness, or not at all.&quot; He felt Larkin to be &quot;the best poet England now has.&quot;

In his biography, Richard Bradford writes that the reviews for &quot;High Windows&quot; showed &quot;genuine admiration&quot; but notes that they typically encountered problems describing &quot;the individual genius at work&quot; in poems such as &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot;, &quot;The Explosion&quot; and &quot;The Building&quot; while also explaining why each were &quot;so radically different&quot; from one another. Robert Nye in &quot;The Times&quot; overcame this problem &quot;by treating the differences as ineffective masks for a consistently nasty presence&quot;.

In &quot;Larkin at Sixty&quot;, amongst the portraits by friends and colleagues such as Kingsley Amis, Noel Hughes and Charles Monteith and dedicatory poems by John Betjeman, Peter Porter and Gavin Ewart, the various strands of Larkin&#x27;s output were analysed by critics and fellow poets: Andrew Motion, Christopher Ricks and Seamus Heaney looked at the poems, Alan Brownjohn wrote on the novels, and Donald Mitchell and Clive James looked at his jazz criticism.

===Critical opinion===

In 1980, Neil Powell wrote: &quot;It is probably fair to say that Philip Larkin is less highly regarded in academic circles than either Thom Gunn or Donald Davie&quot;. But since the turn of the century, Larkin&#x27;s standing has increased. &quot;Philip Larkin is an excellent example of the plain style in modern times&quot;, writes Tijana Stojkovic. Robert Sheppard asserts: &quot;It is by general consent that the work of Philip Larkin is taken to be exemplary&quot;. &quot;Larkin is the most widely celebrated and arguably the finest poet of the Movement&quot;, states Keith Tuma, and his poetry is &quot;more various than its reputation for dour pessimism and anecdotes of a disappointed middle class suggests&quot;.

Stephen Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Philip Larkin: Subversive Writer&quot; and John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Larkin, Ideology and Critical Violence&quot; suggest the changing temper of Larkin studies, the latter attacking eminent critics such as James Booth and Anthony Thwaite for their readiness to reduce the poems to works of biography, and stressing instead the genius of Larkin&#x27;s universality and deconstructionism. Cooper argues that &quot;The interplay of signs and motifs in the early work orchestrates a subversion of conventional attitudes towards class, gender, authority and sexual relations&quot;. Cooper identifies Larkin as a progressive writer, and perceives in the letters a &quot;plea for alternative constructs of masculinity, femininity and social and political organisation&quot;. Cooper draws on the entire canon of Larkin&#x27;s works, as well as on unpublished correspondence, to counter the image of Larkin as merely a racist, misogynist reactionary. Instead he identifies in Larkin what he calls a &quot;subversive imagination&quot;. He highlights in particular &quot;Larkin&#x27;s objections to the hypocrisies of conventional sexual politics that hamper the lives of both sexes in equal measure&quot;.

In similar vein to Cooper, Stephen Regan notes in an essay entitled &quot;Philip Larkin: a late modern poet&quot; that Larkin frequently embraces devices associated with the experimental practices of Modernism, such as &quot;linguistic strangeness, self-conscious literariness, radical self-questioning, sudden shifts of voice and register, complex viewpoints and perspectives, and symbolist intensity&quot;.

A further indication of a new direction in the critical valuation of Larkin is Sisir Kumar Chatterjee&#x27;s statement that &quot;Larkin is no longer just a name but an institution, a modern British national cultural monument&quot;.

Chatterjee&#x27;s view of Larkin is grounded in a detailed analysis of his poetic style. He observes a development from Larkin&#x27;s early works to his later ones, which sees his style change from &quot;verbal opulence through a recognition of the self-ironising and self-negating potentiality of language to a linguistic domain where the conventionally held conceptual incompatibles – which are traditional binary oppositions between absolutes and relatives, between abstracts and concretes, between fallings and risings and between singleness and multiplicity – are found to be the last stumbling-block for an artist aspiring to rise above the impasse of worldliness&quot;. This contrasts with an older view that Larkin&#x27;s style barely changed over the course of his poetic career. Chatterjee identifies this view as being typified by Bernard Bergonzi&#x27;s comment that &quot;Larkin&#x27;s poetry did not ... develop between 1955 and 1974&quot;. For Chatterjee, Larkin&#x27;s poetry responds strongly to changing &quot;economic, socio-political, literary and cultural factors&quot;.
Chatterjee argues: &quot;It is under the defeatist veneer of his poetry that the positive side of Larkin&#x27;s vision of life is hidden&quot;. This positivity, suggests Chatterjee, is most apparent in his later works. Over the course of Larkin&#x27;s poetic career: &quot;The most notable attitudinal development lay in the zone of his view of life, which from being almost irredeemably bleak and pessimistic in &quot;The North Ship&quot;, became more and more positive with the passage of time&quot;.

The view that Larkin is not a nihilist or pessimist, but actually displays optimism in his works, is certainly not universally endorsed, but Chatterjee&#x27;s study suggests the degree to which old stereotypes of Larkin are now being transcended. Representative of these stereotypes is Bryan Appleyard&#x27;s judgement (quoted by Maeve Brennan) that of the writers who &quot;have adopted a personal pose of extreme pessimism and loathing of the world ... none has done so with quite such a grinding focus on littleness and triviality as Larkin the man&quot;. Recent criticism of Larkin demonstrates a more complex set of values at work in his poetry and across the totality of his writings.

The debate about Larkin is summed up by Matthew Johnson, who observes that in most evaluations of Larkin &quot;one is not really discussing the man, but actually reading a coded and implicit discussion of the supposed values of &#x27;Englishness&#x27; that he is held to represent&quot;. Changing attitudes to Englishness are reflected in changing attitudes to Larkin, and the more sustained intellectual interest in the English national character, as embodied in the works of Peter Mandler for instance, pinpoint one key reason why there is an increased scholarly interest in Larkin.

A summative view similar to those of Johnson and Regan is that of Robert Crawford, who argues that &quot;In various ways, Larkin&#x27;s work depends on, and develops from, Modernism.&quot; Furthermore, he &quot;demonstrates just how slippery the word &#x27;English&#x27; is&quot;.

Despite these recent developments, Larkin and his circle are nonetheless still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets. For example, the poet Andrew Duncan, writing of The Movement on his pinko.org website, is of the opinion that &quot;there now seems to be a very wide consensus that it was a bad thing, and that Movement poems are tedious, shallow, smug, sententious, emotionally dead, etc. Their successors in the mainstream retain most of these characteristics. Wolfgang Gortschacher&#x27;s book on Little Magazine Profiles ... shows ... that there was a terrific dearth of magazines during the 50s—an impoverishment of openings which correlates with rigid and conservative poetry, and with the hegemony of a few people determined to exclude dissidents.&quot; 

Peter Riley, a participant in the British Poetry Revival, which was a reaction against The Movement&#x27;s poets, has also criticised Larkin for his uncritical and ideologically narrow position: &quot;What after all were Larkin and The Movement but a denial of the effusive ethics of poetry from 1795 onwards, in favour of &#x27;This is what life is really like&#x27; as if anyone thought for a second of representing observable &#x27;life&#x27;. W.S. Graham and Dylan Thomas knew perfectly well that &#x27;life&#x27; was like that, if you nominated it thus, which is why they went elsewhere.&quot;

===Posthumous reputation===

Larkin&#x27;s posthumous reputation was deeply affected by the publication in 1992 of Anthony Thwaite&#x27;s edition of his letters and, the following year, his official biography, &quot;Philip Larkin: A Writer&#x27;s Life&quot; by Andrew Motion. These revealed his obsession with pornography, his racism, his increasing shift to the political right wing, and his habitual expressions of venom and spleen. In 1990, even before the publication of these two books, Tom Paulin wrote that Larkin&#x27;s &quot;obscenity is informed by prejudices that are not by any means as ordinary, commonplace, or acceptable as the poetic language in which they are so plainly spelled out.&quot; 

The letters and Motion&#x27;s biography fuelled further assessments of this kind, such as Lisa Jardine&#x27;s comment in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;The Britishness of Larkin&#x27;s poetry carries a baggage of attitudes which the &quot;Selected Letters&quot; now make explicit&quot;. On the other hand, the revelations were dismissed by the novelist Martin Amis in &quot;The War Against Cliché&quot;, arguing that the letters in particular show nothing more than a tendency for Larkin to tailor his words according to the recipient. A similar argument was made by Richard Bradford in his biography on Larkin from 2005. Commenting on &quot;Letters to Monica&quot;
(2010) Graeme Richardson states that the collection went &quot;some way towards the restoration of Larkin&#x27;s tarnished image...reveal(ing) Larkin as not quite the sinister, black-hearted near-rapist everyone thought it was OK to abuse in the 90s.&quot;

Trying to resolve Larkin&#x27;s contradictory opinions on race in his book &quot;Such Deliberate Disguises: The Art of Philip Larkin&quot;, the writer Richard Palmer quotes a letter Larkin wrote to Betjeman, as if it exposes &quot;all the post-Motion and post-Letters furore about Larkin&#x27;s &#x27;racism&#x27; as the nonsense it is&quot;:

The American Negro is trying to take a step forward that can be compared only to the ending of slavery in the nineteenth century. And despite the dogs, the hosepipes and the burnings, advances have already been made towards giving the Negro his civil rights that would have been inconceivable when Louis Armstrong was a young man. These advances will doubtless continue. They will end only when the Negro is as well-housed, educated and medically cared for as the white man.

Reviewing Palmer&#x27;s book, John G. Rodwan, Jr. proposes that:

a less forgiving reader could counter by asking if this does not qualify as the thought of a &quot;true racist&quot;: I find the state of the nation quite terrifying. In 10 years&#x27; time we shall all be cowering under our beds as hordes of blacks steal anything they can lay their hands on. Or this: We don&#x27;t go to cricket Test matches now, too many fucking niggers about.

Despite controversy about his personal life and opinions, Larkin remains one of Britain&#x27;s most popular poets. In 2003, almost two decades after his death, Larkin was chosen as &quot;the nation&#x27;s best-loved poet&quot; in a survey by the Poetry Book Society, and in 2008 &quot;The Times&quot; named Larkin as the greatest British post-war writer. Three of his poems, &quot;This Be The Verse&quot;, &quot;The Whitsun Weddings&quot; and &quot;An Arundel Tomb&quot;, featured in the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Top 100 Poems&quot; as voted for by viewers of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Bookworm&quot; in 1995. 

Media interest in Larkin has increased in the twenty-first century. Larkin&#x27;s collection &quot;The Whitsun Weddings&quot; is one of the available poetry texts in the AQA English Literature A Level syllabus, while &quot;High Windows&quot; is offered by the OCR board. Buses in Hull displayed extracts from his poems in 2010.

The Centennial of Larkin&#x27;s birth was celebrated in 2022.

===Recordings===

In 1959, the Marvell Press published &quot;Listen presents Philip Larkin reading The Less Deceived&quot; (Listen LPV1), an LP record on which Larkin recites all the poems from &quot;The Less Deceived&quot; in the order they appear in the printed volume. This was followed, in 1965, by &quot;Philip Larkin reads and comments on The Whitsun Weddings&quot; (Listen LPV6), again on the Marvell Press&#x27;s record label (though the printed volume was published by Faber and Faber). Once again the poems are read in the order in which they appear in the printed volume, but with Larkin including introductory remarks to many of the poems. A recording of Larkin reading the poems from his final collection, &quot;High Windows&quot;, was published in 1975 as &quot;British poets of our time. Philip Larkin; High Windows: poems read by the author&quot; (edited by Peter Orr) on the Argo record label (Argo PLP 1202). As with the two previous recordings, the sequencing of the poems is the same as in the printed volume.

Larkin also appears on several audio poetry anthologies: &quot;The Jupiter Anthology of 20th Century English Poetry – Part III&quot; (JUR 00A8), issued in 1963 and featuring &quot;An Arundel Tomb&quot; and &quot;Mr Bleaney&quot; (this same recording was issued in the United States in 1967 on the Folkways record label as &quot;Anthology of 20th Century English Poetry – Part III&quot; (FL9870)); &quot;The Poet Speaks&quot; record 8 (Argo PLP 1088), issued in 1967 and featuring &quot;Wants&quot;, &quot;Coming&quot;, &quot;Nothing to be Said&quot;, &quot;Days&quot; and &quot;Dockery and Son&quot;; &quot;On Record&quot; (YA3), issued in 1974 by Yorkshire Arts Association and featuring &quot;Here&quot;, &quot;Days&quot;, &quot;Next, Please&quot;, &quot;Wedding-Wind&quot;, &quot;The Whitsun Weddings&quot;, &quot;XXX&quot;, &quot;XIII&quot; (these last two poems from &quot;The North Ship&quot;); and &quot;Douglas Dunn and Philip Larkin&quot;, issued in 1984 by Faber and Faber (A Faber Poetry cassette), featuring Larkin reading 13 poems including, for the first time on a recording, &quot;Aubade&quot;.

Despite the fact that Larkin made audio recordings (in studio conditions) of each of his three mature collections, and separate recordings of groups of poems for a number of audio anthologies, he somehow gained a reputation as a poet who was reluctant to make recordings in which he read his own work. While Larkin did express a dislike of the sound of his own voice (&quot;I come from Coventry, between the sloppiness of Leicester and the whine of Birmingham, you know—and sometimes it comes out&quot;), the evidence indicates that this influenced more his preference not to give public readings of his own work, than his willingness to make audio recordings of his poems.

In 1980, Larkin was invited by the Poets&#x27; Audio Center, Washington, to record a selection of poems from the full range of his poetic output for publication on a Watershed Foundation cassette tape. The recording was made in February 1980 (at Larkin&#x27;s own expense) by John Weeks, a sound engineer colleague from the University of Hull. Although negotiations between Larkin, his publishers and the Watershed Foundation collapsed, the recording (of Larkin reading 26 poems selected from his four canonical volumes of poetry) was sold – by Larkin – to Harvard University&#x27;s Poetry Room in 1981. 

In 2004, a copy of this recording was uncovered in the Hornsea garage studio of the engineer who had made the recording for Larkin. (Subsequently, Larkin&#x27;s own copy of the recording was found in the Larkin Archive at the University of Hull.) News of the &quot;newly discovered&quot; recording made the headlines in 2006, with extracts being broadcast in a Sky News report. A programme examining the discovery in more depth, &quot;The Larkin Tapes&quot;, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in March 2008. The recordings were issued on CD by Faber and Faber in January 2009 as &quot;The Sunday Sessions&quot;.

In contrast to the number of audio recordings of Larkin reading his own work, there are very few appearances by Larkin on television. The only programme in which he agreed to be filmed taking part is &quot;Down Cemetery Road&quot; (1964), from the BBC &quot;Monitor&quot; series, in which Larkin was interviewed by John Betjeman. The filming took place in and around Hull (with some filming in North Lincolnshire), and showed Larkin in his natural surroundings: his flat in Pearson Park, the Brynmor Jones Library; and visiting churches and cemeteries. The film was broadcast on BBC Four. In 1981, Larkin was part of a group of poets who surprised John Betjeman on his seventy-fifth birthday by turning up on his doorstep with gifts and greetings. This scene was filmed by Jonathan Stedall and later featured in the third episode of his 1983 series for BBC2, &quot;Time With Betjeman&quot;.

In 1982, as part of the celebrations for his sixtieth birthday, Larkin was the subject of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;. Although Larkin declined the invitation to appear in the programme, he recorded (on audio tape) &quot;a lot of poems&quot; specifically for it. Melvyn Bragg commented, in his introduction to the programme, that the poet had given his full cooperation. The programme, broadcast on 30 May, featured contributions from Kingsley Amis, Andrew Motion and Alan Bennett. Bennett was also filmed reading several Larkin poems a few years later, in an edition of &quot;Poetry in Motion&quot;, broadcast by Channel 4 in 1990.

===Fiction based on Larkin&#x27;s life===
In 1999, Oliver Ford Davies starred in Ben Brown&#x27;s play &quot;Larkin With Women&quot; at the Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, reprising his role at the Orange Tree Theatre, London, in 2006. The play was published by Larkin&#x27;s usual publishers, Faber and Faber. Set in the three decades after Larkin&#x27;s arrival in Hull, it explores his long relationships with Monica Jones, Maeve Brennan and Betty Mackereth. Another Larkin-inspired entertainment, devised by and starring Sir Tom Courtenay, was given a pre-production performance in June 2002 at Hull University&#x27;s Middleton Hall. Courtenay performed his one-man play &quot;Pretending to Be Me&quot; as part of the Second Hull International Conference on the Work of Philip Larkin. 

In November that year, Courtenay debuted the play at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, later transferring the production to the Comedy Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. An audio recording of the play, which is based on Larkin&#x27;s letters, interviews, diaries and verse, was released in 2005. In June 2010, Courtenay returned to the University of Hull to give a performance of a newly revised version of &quot;Pretending to Be Me&quot; called &quot;Larkin Revisited&quot; in aid of the Larkin statue appeal as part of the Larkin 25 festival.

In July 2003, BBC Two broadcast a play entitled &quot;Love Again&quot;—its title also that of one of Larkin&#x27;s most painfully personal poems—dealing with the last thirty years of Larkin&#x27;s life (though not shot anywhere near Hull). The lead role was played by Hugh Bonneville, and in the same year Channel 4 broadcast the documentary &quot;Philip Larkin, Love and Death in Hull&quot;.

In April 2008, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a play by Chris Harrald entitled &quot;Mr Larkin&#x27;s Awkward Day&quot;, recounting the practical joke played on him in 1957 by his friend Robert Conquest, a fellow poet.

===Philip Larkin Society===
The Philip Larkin Society is a charitable organization dedicated to preserving the memory and works of Philip Larkin. It was formed in 1995 on the tenth anniversary of Larkin&#x27;s death, and achieved charity status in the United Kingdom in 2000. Anthony Thwaite, one of Larkin&#x27;s literary executors, was the society&#x27;s president until his death in 2021. Professor James Booth is an Honorary Vice-president and Honorary Life Member, as was Professor Eddie Dawes, the society&#x27;s inaugural Chair. The current Society president is Rosie Millard OBE. The Society&#x27;s Chair is Graham Chesters and deputy chair is Lyn Lockwood.

The society carries out various activities, such as lectures, walking tours and events for Larkin and his literary contemporaries. It hosted the Larkin 25 art festival from June to December 2010 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Larkin&#x27;s death, and in 2016 unveiled Larkin&#x27;s memorial stone at Poet&#x27;s Corner in Westminster Abbey, which includes lines from &quot;An Arundel Tomb&quot;: &quot;Our almost-instinct almost true / What will survive of us is love&quot;.

==Memorials==
Memorials to Larkin in Kingston upon Hull, where he worked and wrote much of his poetry, are the Larkin Building at the University of Hull housing teaching facilities and lecture rooms and the Philip Larkin Centre for Poetry and Creative Writing which hosts a regular programme of literary events.

In May 2022 Larkin&#x27;s childhood school, King Henry VIII School, dedicated a memorial room, called &#x27;The Philip Larkin Room&#x27;, next to the main school hall, otherwise known as Burgess Hall.

In 2010, the city marked the 25th anniversary of his death with the Larkin 25 Festival. A video was commissioned to illustrate Larkin&#x27;s poem &quot;Here&quot;, his hymn to Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire. Forty decorated toad sculptures entitled &quot;Larkin with Toads&quot; were displayed in the city in tribute to Larkin&#x27;s poem &quot;Toads&quot; on 17 July 2010.
A larger-than-life-size bronze statue of Larkin by sculptor Martin Jennings was unveiled at Hull Paragon Interchange in December 2010, closing the Larkin 25 events. It is inscribed, &quot;That Whitsun I was late getting away&quot;, from the poem, &quot;The Whitsun Weddings&quot;. 

Funding for the £100,000 statue, designed by Martin Jennings, was raised at charity events and auctions with support from Hull City Council. The unveiling was accompanied by Nathaniel Seaman&#x27;s &quot;Fanfare for Larkin&quot;, composed for the occasion. Five plaques containing Larkin&#x27;s poems were added to the floor near the statue in 2011. In December 2012, a memorial bench was installed around a pillar near the statue.

In June 2015, it was announced that Larkin would be honoured with a floor stone memorial at Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey. The memorial was unveiled on 2 December 2016, the 31st anniversary of his death. Actor Sir Tom Courtenay and artist Grayson Perry both read from Larkin&#x27;s work during the unveiling ceremony and an address was given by poet and author Blake Morrison. The memorial includes two lines quoted from his poem &quot;An Arundel Tomb&quot;:Our almost-instinct almost true:What will survive of us is love.

From 5 July to 1 October 2017, as part of the Hull UK City of Culture 2017 celebrations, the Brynmor Jones Library at Hull University mounted the exhibition &quot;Larkin: New Eyes Each Year&quot;. It featured objects from Larkin&#x27;s life, as well as his personal collection of books from his last home at Newland Park, in the original shelf order in which he had arranged them. Also in 2017, in the Burgess district of Coventry, the pub known as The Tudor Rose was renamed The Philip Larkin.

<doc id="43926" wikidata="Q691350" url="?curid=43926" title="Java API for XML Processing">
<text>In computing, the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) ( ), one of the Java XML application programming interfaces (APIs), provides the capability of validating and parsing XML documents. It has three basic parsing interfaces:

* the Document Object Model parsing interface or DOM interface
* the Simple API for XML parsing interface or SAX interface
* the Streaming API for XML or StAX interface (part of JDK 6; separate jar available for JDK 5)

In addition to the parsing interfaces, the API provides an XSLT interface to provide data and structural transformations on an XML document.

JAXP was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 5 (JAXP 1.0), JSR 63 (JAXP 1.1 and 1.2), and JSR 206 (JAXP 1.3).
JAXP version 1.4.4 was released on September 3, 2010. JAXP 1.3 was declared end-of-life on February 12, 2008.

== DOM interface ==
The DOM interface parses an entire XML document and constructs a complete in-memory representation of the document using the classes and modeling the concepts found in the Document Object Model Level 2 Core Specification.

The DOM parser is called a , as it builds an in-memory codice_1 representation. The is created by the . The creates an instance - a tree structure containing nodes in the XML Document. Each tree node in the structure implements the interface. Among the many different types of tree nodes, each representing the type of data found in an XML document, the most important include:

* element nodes that may have attributes
* text nodes representing the text found between the start and end tags of a document element.

== SAX interface ==
The creates the SAX parser, called the . Unlike the DOM parser, the SAX parser does not create an in-memory representation of the XML document and so runs faster and uses less memory. Instead, the SAX parser informs clients of the XML document structure by invoking callbacks, that is, by invoking methods on an instance provided to the parser. This way of accessing document is called Streaming XML.

The codice_2 class implements the , the , the , and the interfaces. Most clients will be interested in methods defined in the codice_3 interface that are called when the SAX parser encounters the corresponding elements in the XML document. The most important methods in this interface are:

* and methods that are called at the start and end of a XML document.
* codice_4 and codice_5 methods that are called at the start and end of a document element.
* codice_6 method that is called with the text data contents contained between the start and end tags of an XML document element.

Clients provide a subclass of the codice_2 that overrides these methods and processes the data. This may involve storing the data into a database or writing it out to a stream.

During parsing, the parser may need to access external documents. It is possible to store a local cache for frequently used documents using an XML Catalog.

This was introduced with Java 1.3 in May 2000.

== StAX interface ==
StAX was designed as a median between the DOM and SAX interface. In its metaphor, the programmatic entry point is a cursor that represents a point within the document. The application moves the cursor forward - &#x27;pulling&#x27; the information from the parser as it needs. This is different from an event based API - such as SAX - which &#x27;pushes&#x27; data to the application - requiring the application to maintain state between events as necessary to keep track of location within the document.

== XSLT interface ==
The XML Stylesheet Language for Transformations, or XSLT, allows for conversion of an XML document into other forms of data. JAXP provides interfaces in package allowing applications to invoke an XSLT transformation. This interface was originally called TrAX (Transformation API for XML), and was developed by an informal collaboration between the developers of a number of Java XSLT processors.

Main features of the interface are

* a factory class allowing the application to select dynamically which XSLT processor it wishes to use (, , .
* methods on the factory class to create a object, representing the compiled form of a stylesheet. This is a thread-safe object that can be used repeatedly, in series or in parallel, to apply the same stylesheet to multiple source documents (or to the same source document with different parameters) (), also , ), a method on the object to create a , representing the executable form of a stylesheet () This cannot be shared across threads, though it is serially reusable. The provides methods to set stylesheet parameters and serialization options (for example, whether output should be indented), and a method to actually run the transformation. ().

Two abstract interfaces and are defined to represent the input and output of the transformation. This is a somewhat unconventional use of Java interfaces, since there is no expectation that a processor will accept any class that implements the interface - each processor can choose which kinds of or it is prepared to handle. In practice all JAXP processors supports several standard kinds of Source (, ) and several standard kinds of Result (, ) and possibly other implementations of their own.

=== Example ===
The most primitive but complete example of XSLT transformation launching may look like this:
/* file src/examples/xslt/XsltDemo.java */
package examples.xslt;

import java.io.StringReader;
import java.io.StringWriter;

import javax.xml.transform.Transformer;
import javax.xml.transform.TransformerException;
import javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory;
import javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactoryConfigurationError;
import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamResult;
import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource;

public class XsltDemo {
 public static void main(String[] args) throws TransformerFactoryConfigurationError, TransformerException {
 //language=xslt
 String xsltResource =
 &lt;?xml version=&#x27;1.0&#x27; encoding=&#x27;UTF-8&#x27;?&gt;
 &lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&#x27;2.0&#x27; xmlns:xsl=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&#x27;&gt;
 &lt;xsl:output method=&#x27;xml&#x27; indent=&#x27;no&#x27;/&gt;
 &lt;xsl:template match=&#x27;/&#x27;&gt;
 &lt;reRoot&gt;&lt;reNode&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&#x27;/root/node/@val&#x27; /&gt; world&lt;/reNode&gt;&lt;/reRoot&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
 //language=XML
 String xmlSourceResource =
 &lt;?xml version=&#x27;1.0&#x27; encoding=&#x27;UTF-8&#x27;?&gt;
 &lt;root&gt;&lt;node val=&#x27;hello&#x27;/&gt;&lt;/root&gt;

 StringWriter xmlResultResource = new StringWriter();

 Transformer xmlTransformer = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(
 new StreamSource(new StringReader(xsltResource))

 xmlTransformer.transform(
 new StreamSource(new StringReader(xmlSourceResource)), new StreamResult(xmlResultResource)

 System.out.println(xmlResultResource.getBuffer().toString());
}

It applies the following hardcoded XSLT transformation:
&lt;?xml version=&#x27;1.0&#x27; encoding=&#x27;UTF-8&#x27;?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&#x27;2.0&#x27; xmlns:xsl=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&#x27;&gt;
 &lt;xsl:output method=&#x27;xml&#x27; indent=&#x27;no&#x27;/&gt;
 &lt;xsl:template match=&#x27;/&#x27;&gt;
 &lt;reRoot&gt;&lt;reNode&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&#x27;/root/node/@val&#x27; /&gt; world&lt;/reNode&gt;&lt;/reRoot&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

To the following hardcoded XML document:
&lt;?xml version=&#x27;1.0&#x27; encoding=&#x27;UTF-8&#x27;?&gt;
&lt;root&gt;&lt;node val=&#x27;hello&#x27;/&gt;&lt;/root&gt;

The result of execution will be
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;reRoot&gt;&lt;reNode&gt;hello world&lt;/reNode&gt;&lt;/reRoot&gt;

Nicknamed the &quot;Piano Man&quot; after his signature 1973 song of the same name, Joel has had a successful career as a solo artist since the 1970s. From 1971 to 1993, he released 12 studio albums spanning the genres of pop and rock, and in 2001 released a one-off studio album of classical compositions. With over 160 million records sold worldwide, Joel is one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists and is the fourth-best-selling solo artist in the United States. His 1985 compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits – Volume I &amp; Volume II&quot;, is one of the best-selling albums in the United States.

Joel was born in the Bronx in New York City and grew up on Long Island, where he began taking piano lessons at his mother&#x27;s insistence. After dropping out of high school to pursue a music career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, the Hassles and Attila, before signing a record deal with Family Productions and embarking on a solo career with his debut album, &quot;Cold Spring Harbor&quot; (1971). In 1972, Joel caught the attention of Columbia Records after a live radio performance of &quot;Captain Jack&quot; became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company, through which he released his second album, &quot;Piano Man&quot; (1973). After &quot;Streetlife Serenade&quot; (1974) and &quot;Turnstiles&quot; (1976), Joel achieved his critical and commercial breakthrough with &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1977). It became Columbia&#x27;s best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning the hit singles &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;, &quot;Movin&#x27; Out (Anthony&#x27;s Song)&quot;, &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot;, and &quot;She&#x27;s Always a Woman&quot;, as well as the concert staples &quot;Scenes from an Italian Restaurant&quot; and &quot;Vienna&quot;.

&quot;52nd Street&quot; (1978) was Joel&#x27;s first album to reach No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Glass Houses&quot; (1980) was an attempt to further establish himself as a rock artist; it featured &quot;It&#x27;s Still Rock and Roll to Me&quot; (Joel&#x27;s first single to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), &quot;You May Be Right&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me Why&quot;, and &quot;Sometimes a Fantasy&quot;. &quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot; (1982) stemmed from a desire to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. &quot;An Innocent Man&quot; (1983) served as an homage to genres of music that Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as rhythm and blues and doo-wop; it featured &quot;Tell Her About It&quot;, &quot;Uptown Girl&quot;, and &quot;The Longest Time&quot;, three of his best-known songs. After &quot;River of Dreams&quot; (1993), he largely retired from producing studio material, although he went on to release &quot;Fantasies &amp; Delusions&quot; (2001), featuring classical compositions composed by him and performed by British-Korean pianist Richard Hyung-ki Joo. Joel provided voiceover work in 1988 for the Disney animated film &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;, performing the song &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot;, and contributed to the soundtracks to several films, including &quot;Easy Money&quot; (1983), &quot;Ruthless People&quot; (1986), and &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; (1992). Joel returned to composing new music with the 2024 single “Turn the Lights Back On”.

Joel has had a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe. In 1987, he became one of the first artists to hold a rock tour in the Soviet Union. Joel has had 33 Top 40 hits in the U.S., three of which (&quot;It&#x27;s Still Rock and Roll to Me&quot;, &quot;Tell Her About It&quot;, and &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;) topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He has been nominated for 23 Grammy Awards, winning 6, including Album of the Year for &quot;52nd Street&quot;. Joel was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006. He received the 2001 Johnny Mercer Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and was recognized at the 2013 Kennedy Center Honors.

== Early life, family and education ==
Billy Joel was born on May 9, 1949, in The Bronx. When he was 1 year old, his family moved to Hicksville, New York in the town of Oyster Bay on Long Island. He and his cousin Judy, whom his parents adopted, were raised in a section of Levitt homes.

His mother, Rosalind (1922–2014), was born in Brooklyn to Jewish parents, Philip and Rebecca Nyman, who emigrated from England. Billy&#x27;s father, Howard (born Helmut) Joel (1923–2011), an accomplished amateur classical pianist and businessman, was born in Nuremberg, Germany to a Jewish family, the son of merchant and manufacturer Karl Amson Joel, and educated in Switzerland. Billy&#x27;s grandfather, Karl Amson Joel, had created a highly successful mail-order textile business, Joel Macht Fabrik. Escaping the Nazi regime, Karl, his wife and young son emigrated to Switzerland. Billy&#x27;s grandfather was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value in order to emigrate. The family reached the United States via Cuba, because immigration quotas for German Jews prevented direct immigration at the time. In the United States, Howard became an engineer but always loved music.

Billy Joel&#x27;s parents met in the late 1930s at City College of New York at a Gilbert and Sullivan performance. He has said that neither of his parents talked much about World War II, which were such dark years; it was not until later that Joel learned more about his father&#x27;s family. After Rosalind and Howard Joel divorced in 1957, Howard returned to Europe, as he had never liked the US: he considered the people uneducated and materialistic. He settled in Vienna, Austria, and later remarried. Joel has a half-brother, Alexander Joel, born to his father in Europe, who became a classical conductor there and was the chief musical director of the Staatstheater Braunschweig from 2001 to 2014.

Joel reluctantly began taking piano lessons at age four at his mother&#x27;s insistence. His teachers included the noted American pianist Morton Estrin and musician Timothy Ford. Joel says that he is a better organist than a pianist. As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so he could defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, winning 22 bouts, but abandoned the sport shortly after his nose was broken in his 24th match.

Although Joel&#x27;s parents were Jewish, he did not grow up in the religion. &quot;I was not brought up Jewish in any religious way. My circumcision was as Jewish as they got.&quot; He attended a Roman Catholic church with friends. At age 11, he was baptized in a Church of Christ in Hicksville. He now identifies as an atheist Jew.

Joel attended Hicksville High School in Hicksville until 1967 but did not graduate with his class. He was playing at a piano bar to help support himself, his mother and sister, and missed a crucial English exam after playing a late-night gig the evening before. Although Joel was a comparatively strong student, at the end of his senior year, he did not have enough credits to graduate. Rather than attend summer school to earn his diploma, Joel decided to begin a music career: &quot;I told them, &#x27;To hell with it. If I&#x27;m not going to Columbia University, I&#x27;m going to Columbia Records, and you don&#x27;t need a high school diploma over there&#x27;.&quot; In 1992, he submitted essays to the school board in lieu of the missed exam. They were accepted, and he was awarded his diploma at Hicksville High&#x27;s annual graduation ceremony 25 years after leaving.

==Music career==
===1964–1970: Early career===
Influenced by early rock &amp; roll and rhythm &amp; blues artists, including Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, Joel favored tightly structured pop melodies and down-to-earth songwriting. After seeing the Beatles on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, Joel decided to pursue a career in music. He recalled:

At age 16, Joel joined the Echoes, a group which specialized in British Invasion covers. The Echoes began recording in 1965. Joel played piano on several records released through Kama Sutra Productions and on recordings produced by Shadow Morton. Joel played on a demo version of &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;, which became a major hit for the Shangri-Las. Joel states that in 1964 he played on a recording of the Shangri-Las&#x27; &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot; but he is unaware of whether he played on the demo or master version. The released single included a co-producer credit for Artie Ripp, who later was the first to sign and produce Joel as a solo artist after Michael Lang, who had given Joel a monetary advance, passed Joel along to Ripp to focus his attentions elsewhere.

In late 1965, the Echoes changed their name to the Emeralds, and then to the Lost Souls. Joel left the band in 1967 to join the Hassles, a Long Island group that had signed with United Artists Records. Over the next year and a half, they released four singles and two albums (&quot;The Hassles&quot; and &quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot;). All were commercial failures. Joel and drummer Jon Small left the Hassles in 1969 to form the duo Attila, releasing an eponymous debut album in July 1970. The duo disbanded the following October when Joel began an affair with Small&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth. The pair later married.

===1970–1974: &quot;Cold Spring Harbor&quot; and &quot;Piano Man&quot;===

Joel signed a contract with the record company Family Productions, with which he recorded his first solo album, &quot;Cold Spring Harbor&quot;, named for a hamlet on his native Long Island. Artie Ripp, owner of Family Productions, states that he spent US$450,000 developing Joel; nevertheless, the album was mastered at too high a speed and was a technical and commercial disappointment.

The popular songs &quot;She&#x27;s Got a Way&quot; and &quot;Everybody Loves You Now&quot; were originally released on this album, but went largely unnoticed until being released as live performances on &quot;Songs in the Attic &quot;(1981). Columbia released a remastered version of &quot;Cold Spring Harbor&quot; in 1983, with certain songs shortened or re-orchestrated.

Joel began his &quot;Cold Spring Harbor&quot; tour in the fall of 1971, touring with his band, consisting of Rhys Clark on drums, Al Hertzberg on guitar, and Larry Russell on bass guitar, throughout the mainland United States and Puerto Rico, opening for such artists as the J. Geils Band, the Beach Boys, Badfinger and Taj Mahal. Joel&#x27;s performance at the Puerto Rican Mar y Sol Pop Festival was especially well-received; and although recorded, Joel refused to have it published on the Mar Y Sol compilation album &quot;Mar Y Sol: The First International Puerto Rico Pop Festival&quot;. Nevertheless, interest in his music grew.

During the spring of 1972, the Philadelphia radio station WMMR-FM began playing a concert recording of &quot;Captain Jack&quot;, which became an underground hit on the East Coast. Herb Gordon, a Columbia Records executive, heard Joel&#x27;s music and introduced him to the company. Joel signed a recording contract with Columbia in 1972 and moved to Los Angeles; he lived there for the next three years. For six months he worked at The Executive Room piano bar on Wilshire Boulevard as &quot;Bill Martin&quot;. During that time, he composed his signature song &quot;Piano Man&quot; about the bar&#x27;s patrons.

Despite Joel&#x27;s new contract, he was legally bound to Family Productions. Artie Ripp sold Joel&#x27;s first contract to Columbia. Walter Yetnikoff, the president of CBS/Columbia Records at the time, bought back the rights to Joel&#x27;s songs in the late 1970s, giving the rights to Joel as a birthday gift. Yetnikoff notes in the documentary &quot;The Last Play at Shea&quot; that he had to threaten Ripp to close the deal.

Joel&#x27;s first album with Columbia was &quot;Piano Man&quot; (1973). Despite modest sales, the album&#x27;s title track became his signature song, ending nearly every concert. That year Joel&#x27;s touring band changed. Guitarist Al Hertzberg was replaced by Don Evans, and bassist Larry Russell by Patrick McDonald, himself replaced in late 1974 by Doug Stegmeyer, who stayed with Joel until 1989. Rhys Clark returned as drummer and Tom Whitehorse as banjoist and pedal steel player; Johnny Almond joined as saxophonist and keyboardist. The band toured the U.S. and Canada extensively, appearing on popular music shows. Joel&#x27;s songwriting began attracting more attention; in 1974 Helen Reddy recorded the &quot;Piano Man&quot; track &quot;You&#x27;re My Home&quot;.

===1974–1977: &quot;Streetlife Serenade&quot; and &quot;Turnstiles&quot;===
In 1974, Joel recorded his second Columbia album in Los Angeles, &quot;Streetlife Serenade&quot;. His manager at the time was Jon Troy, an old friend from New York&#x27;s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood; Troy was soon replaced by Joel&#x27;s wife Elizabeth. &quot;Streetlife Serenade&quot; contains references to suburbia and the inner city. It is perhaps best known for &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, a No. 34 hit in the U.S. Upset that &quot;Piano Man&quot; had been significantly cut for radio play, Joel wrote &quot;The Entertainer&quot; as a sarcastic response: &quot;If you&#x27;re gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.&quot; Although &quot;Streetlife Serenade&quot; was viewed unfavorably by critics, it contains the notable songs &quot;Los Angelenos&quot; and &quot;Root Beer Rag&quot;, an instrumental that was a staple of his live set in the 1970s.

In late 1975, Joel played piano and organ on several tracks on Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;The 20th Anniversary of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; all-star album.

Disenchanted with Los Angeles, Joel returned to New York City in 1975 and recorded &quot;Turnstiles&quot; (1976), the first album he recorded with the musicians with whom he toured. Produced by James William Guercio (then Chicago&#x27;s producer), &quot;Turnstiles&quot; was first recorded at Caribou Ranch with members of Elton John&#x27;s band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.

&quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot; was a minor hit, covered by Ronnie Spector and Nigel Olsson. In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key &quot;shreds&quot; his vocal cords; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the Hollywood Bowl in May 2014. Although never released as a single, &quot;New York State of Mind&quot; became one of Joel&#x27;s best-known songs; Barbra Streisand recorded a cover and Tony Bennett performed it as a duet with Joel on &quot;Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues&quot;. Other notable songs from the album include &quot;Summer, Highland Falls&quot;; &quot;Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)&quot; and &quot;Prelude/Angry Young Man&quot;, a concert mainstay.

===1977–1979: &quot;The Stranger&quot; and &quot;52nd Street&quot; ===
Columbia Records introduced Joel to Phil Ramone, who produced all of Joel&#x27;s studio albums from 1977 to 1986. &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1977) was an enormous commercial success, yielding four Top-25 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts: &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; (No. 3), &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot; (No. 17), &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot; (No. 24) and &quot;She&#x27;s Always a Woman&quot; (No. 17). Joel&#x27;s first Top Ten album, &quot;The Stranger &quot;reached number two on the charts and was certified multi-platinum, besting Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; as Columbia&#x27;s previous bestselling album. &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;—written for Joel&#x27;s first wife, Elizabeth Weber—was inspired by a dream and won Grammy awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. On tour in Paris, Joel learned the news late one night in a hotel room. It also featured &quot;Scenes from an Italian Restaurant&quot;, an album-oriented rock classic, which has become one of his best-known songs. It is one of Joel&#x27;s favorite of his own songs, which has become a firm staple of his live shows, and &quot;Vienna&quot;, also one of Joel&#x27;s personal favorites and as of 2022 one of his most streamed songs on the internet. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; later ranked &quot;The Stranger&quot; the 70th greatest album of all time.

Joel released &quot;52nd Street&quot; in 1978, naming it after Manhattan&#x27;s 52nd Street, which, at the time of its release, served as the world headquarters of CBS/ Columbia. The album sold over seven million copies, propelled to number one on the charts by the hits &quot;My Life&quot; (No. 3), &quot;Big Shot&quot; (No. 14) and &quot;Honesty&quot; (No. 24). A cover of &quot;My Life&quot; by Gary Bennett became the theme for the television sitcom &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot;. &quot;52nd Street&quot; also won Grammy awards for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male and Album of the Year.

In 1979, Joel traveled to Havana, Cuba to participate in the historic Havana Jam festival March 2–4, alongside Rita Coolidge, Kris Kristofferson, Stephen Stills, the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the Trio of Doom, Fania All-Stars, Billy Swan, Bonnie Bramlett, Mike Finnegan, Weather Report, and an array of Cuban artists including Irakere, Pacho Alonso, Tata Güines and Orquesta Aragón. His performance is captured in Ernesto Juan Castellanos&#x27;s documentary &quot;Havana Jam &#x27;79&quot;.

&quot;52nd Street&quot; was the first commercially released album on the then-new compact disc format, in 1982.

===1979–1983: &quot;Glass Houses&quot; and &quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot;===
The success of his piano-driven ballads like &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Always a Woman&quot; and &quot;Honesty&quot; led some critics to label Joel a &quot;balladeer&quot; and &quot;soft rocker&quot;. He thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with &quot;Glass Houses&quot;, Joel tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of new wave rock music that was starting to become popular. On the album cover, Joel is pictured in a leather jacket, about to throw a rock at a glass house (referring to the adage that &quot;people who live in glass houses shouldn&#x27;t throw stones&quot;).

&quot;Glass Houses&quot; spent six weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and yielded the hits &quot;You May Be Right&quot; (No. 7, May 1980), &quot;It&#x27;s Still Rock and Roll to Me&quot;, (No. 1, July 1980), &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me Why&quot; (No. 19, September 1980) and &quot;Sometimes a Fantasy&quot; (No. 36, November 1980). &quot;It&#x27;s Still Rock and Roll to Me&quot;, Joel&#x27;s first &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one single, spent 11 weeks in the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was the seventh biggest hit of 1980 according to American Top 40. His five sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in 1980 earned him the Garden&#x27;s Gold Ticket Award for selling more than 100,000 tickets at the venue.

&quot;Glass Houses&quot; won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. It also won the American Music Award for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category. The album&#x27;s closing song, &quot;Through the Long Night&quot; (B-side of the &quot;It&#x27;s Still Rock &amp; Roll to Me&quot; single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yes It Is&quot;. In a recorded Masterclass at the University of Pennsylvania, Joel recalled that he had written to the Beatles asking them how to get started in the music industry. In response, he received a pamphlet about Beatles merchandise. This later led to the idea of Joel conducting Q&amp;A sessions around the world answering questions that people had about the music industry.

Joel&#x27;s next release, &quot;Songs in the Attic&quot;, was composed of live performances of lesser-known songs from the beginning of his career. It was recorded at larger US arenas and in intimate night club shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when &quot;The Stranger&quot; became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and produced two hit singles: &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot; (No. 17), and &quot;She&#x27;s Got a Way&quot; (No. 23). It sold over 3 million copies. Although not as successful as some of his previous albums, it was still considered a success by Joel.

The next wave of Joel&#x27;s career commenced with the recording of &quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot;. With it, Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, which included highly topical songs like &quot;Allentown&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Saigon&quot;. Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about the American Dream and how changes in American politics during the Reagan administration meant that &quot;all of a sudden you weren&#x27;t going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had.&quot; He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to &quot;create a sonic masterpiece&quot; on &quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot;. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album. Production of &quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot; began in the fall of 1981. However, production was temporarily delayed when Joel was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on Long Island on April 15, 1982, severely injuring his hands. Still, Joel quickly recovered from his injuries, and the album ended up being delayed by only a few months.

In 1982, Joel embarked on a brief tour in support of the album. From one of the final shows of the tour, Joel made his first video special, &quot;Live from Long Island&quot;, which was recorded at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York on December 29, 1982. It was originally broadcast on HBO in 1983 before it became available on VHS.

&quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot; went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles &quot;Allentown&quot; and &quot;Pressure&quot;, both directed by Russell Mulcahy.

===1983–1988: &quot;An Innocent Man&quot; and &quot;The Bridge&quot; ===
Joel&#x27;s next album moved away from the serious themes of &quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot; and struck a much lighter tone. &quot;An Innocent Man&quot; was Joel&#x27;s tribute to R&amp;B and doo wop music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel&#x27;s second &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one hit, &quot;Tell Her About It&quot;, which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel&#x27;s catalog. The album was well received by critics, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being &quot;in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles.&quot;

At the time that the album was released, WCBS-FM began playing &quot;Uptown Girl&quot; both in regular rotation and on the &quot;Doo Wop Live&quot;. The song became a worldwide hit upon its release. The music video of the song, originally written about then-girlfriend Elle MacPherson, featured Christie Brinkley as a high-society girl who pulls her car into the gas station where Joel&#x27;s character is working. At the end of the video, Joel&#x27;s &quot;grease monkey&quot; character drives off with his &quot;uptown girl&quot; on the back of a motorcycle. When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was &quot;I don&#x27;t dance&quot;. Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. Their work together on this video shoot sparked a relationship between the two which led to their marriage in 1985.

In December, the title song was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, &quot;The Longest Time&quot; was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, &quot;Leave a Tender Moment Alone&quot; was released and it hit No. 27 while &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot; peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot;, Brinkley also plays the &quot;redhead girl in a Chevrolet&quot;. &quot;An Innocent Man&quot; was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;.
Joel participated in the USA for Africa &quot;We Are the World&quot; project in 1985.

Following &quot;An Innocent Man&quot;, Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; albums as marking the end of one&#x27;s career. This time he agreed, and &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2&quot; was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs &quot;You&#x27;re Only Human (Second Wind)&quot; and &quot;The Night Is Still Young&quot; were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was highly successful and it has since been certified double diamond by the RIAA, with over 11.5 million copies (23 million units) sold. It is one of the best-selling albums in American music history, according to the RIAA.

Coinciding with the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album release, Joel released a two-volume &quot;Video Album&quot; that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to that time. Along with videos for the new singles off the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, &quot;Piano Man&quot;, for this project.

Joel&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Bridge&quot; (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits &quot;A Matter of Trust&quot; and &quot;Modern Woman&quot; (both No. 10) from the film &quot;Ruthless People&quot;, a dark comedy from the directors of &quot;Airplane!&quot;. The ballad &quot;This is the Time&quot; also charted, peaking at No. 18. On November 18, 1986, an extended version of &quot;Big Man on Mulberry Street&quot; was used on a Season 3 episode of &quot;Moonlighting&quot;.&quot;The Bridge&quot; was Joel&#x27;s last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel has also stated in many interviews, most recently in a 2008 interview in &quot;Performing Songwriter&quot; magazine, that he does not think &quot;The Bridge&quot; is a good album.

In October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the Soviet Union. There were live performances at indoor arenas in Moscow, Leningrad and Tbilisi. Joel, his family (including young daughter Alexa), and his full touring band made the trip in July 1987. The entourage was filmed for television and video to offset the cost of the trip, and the concerts were simulcast on radio around the world. Joel&#x27;s Russian tour was the first live rock radio broadcast in Soviet history. The tour was later cited frequently as one of the first fully staged pop rock shows to come to the Soviet Union, although in reality other artists had previously toured in the country, including Elton John, James Taylor and Bonnie Raitt.

Most of that audience took a long while to warm up to Joel&#x27;s energetic show, something that had never happened in other countries he had performed in. According to Joel, each time the fans were hit with the bright lights, anybody who seemed to be enjoying themselves froze. In addition, people who were &quot;overreacting&quot; were removed by security. During this concert Joel, enraged by the bright lights, flipped his electric piano and snapped a microphone stand while continuing to sing. He later apologized for the incident.

The album &quot;КОНЦЕРТ&quot; (Russian for &quot;Concert&quot;) was released in October 1987. Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like &quot;An Innocent Man&quot;. Joel also did versions of the Beatles&#x27; classic &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&quot;. It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1 million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.

===1988–1993: &quot;Storm Front&quot; and &quot;River of Dreams&quot; ===
The animated film &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (1988) features Joel in a rare voice acting role as Dodger, a sarcastic Jack Russell based on Dickens&#x27;s Artful Dodger. The character&#x27;s design is based on Joel&#x27;s image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character&#x27;s song &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot;.

The recording of &quot;Storm Front&quot;, which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel&#x27;s career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber&#x27;s accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90 million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, and in January 1990, Joel was awarded US$2 million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30 million countersuit filed by Weber.

The first single for the album, &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;, was released in September 1989 and it became Joel&#x27;s third—and most recent—US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. &quot;Storm Front&quot; was released in October, and it eventually became Joel&#x27;s first number-one album since &quot;Glass Houses&quot;, nine years earlier. &quot;Storm Front&quot; was Joel&#x27;s first album since &quot;Turnstiles&quot; to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with Mick Jones of Foreigner. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones&#x27;s 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones&#x27;s single &quot;Just Wanna Hold&quot;; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer Liberty DeVitto, guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player Mark Rivera, and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist Crystal Taliefero.

&quot;Storm Front&quot; second single, &quot;I Go to Extremes&quot; reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song &quot;Leningrad&quot;, written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and &quot;The Downeaster Alexa&quot;, written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad &quot;And So It Goes&quot; (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for &quot;An Innocent Man&quot;; but &quot;And So It Goes&quot; did not fit that album&#x27;s retro theme, so it was held back until &quot;Storm Front&quot;. Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that &quot;Storm Front&quot; was a turbulent album and that &quot;And So It Goes&quot;, as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.

In the summer of 1992, Joel filed a US$90 million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract. The case was settled out of court in the fall of 1993 for US$3 million paid to Joel by third party Sony America, to protect its subsidiary Sony Music&#x27;s interests, as it had several other artists also using Grubman&#x27;s law firm.

In 1992, Joel inducted the R&amp;B duo Sam &amp; Dave into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on &quot;River of Dreams&quot;, finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by Christie Brinkley that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The eponymous first single was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits &quot;All About Soul&quot; (with Color Me Badd on backing vocals) and &quot;Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)&quot;, written for his daughter, Alexa. A radio remix version of &quot;All About Soul&quot; can be found on &quot;The Essential Billy Joel&quot; (2001), and a demo version appears on &quot;My Lives&quot; (2005).

The song &quot;The Great Wall of China&quot; was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel&#x27;s 2006 tour. &quot;2000 Years&quot; was prominent in the millennium concert at Madison Square Garden, December 31, 1999, and &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; closed the book on Joel&#x27;s pop songwriting for more than a decade.

===1994–2013: Touring and new singles===

Beginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with Elton John on a series of &quot;Face to Face&quot; tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history. During these shows, the two played their own songs, sang each other&#x27;s songs, and performed duets. They grossed over US$46 million in just 24 dates in their sold out 2003 tour. Joel and John resumed their Face to Face tour in March 2009 and it continued until March 2010, where it ended in Albany, New York, at the Times Union Center. In February 2010, Joel denied rumors in the trade press that he canceled a summer 2010 leg of the tour, claiming there were never any dates booked and that he intended to take the year off. Joel told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;ll probably pick it up again. It&#x27;s always fun playing with him.&quot;
Joel and Christie Brinkley announced on April 13, 1994, that they had separated, and their divorce was finalized in August 1994. The two remained friends.
Joel&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits Volume III&quot; yielded &quot;To Make You Feel My Love&quot; (a Bob Dylan cover) and &quot;Hey Girl&quot;. Joel wrote and recorded the song &quot;Shameless&quot; that was later recorded by Garth Brooks and reached No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. Joel performed with Brooks during his Central Park concert in 1997. Joel was inducted into the Rock &#x27;n Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Ray Charles made the induction speech and mentioned the duet Joel wrote for the two of them, &quot;Baby Grand&quot; (a track on Joel&#x27;s album &quot;The Bridge&quot; released in 1986).

On December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot; and &quot;Scenes from an Italian Restaurant&quot; were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC&#x27;s special New Year&#x27;s Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as &quot;2000 Years: The Millennium Concert&quot;.

In 2001, Joel released &quot;Fantasies &amp; Delusions&quot;, a collection of classical piano pieces composed by Joel and performed by Hyung-ki Joo. Joel often uses bits of these pieces as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot;. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed &quot;New York State of Mind&quot; live on September 21, 2001, as part of the benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with &quot;Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)&quot;, at the Concert for New York City in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed &quot;Your Song&quot; with Elton John.

In 2003, Joel inducted The Righteous Brothers into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song &quot;Until the Night&quot; from the album &quot;52nd Street&quot; was a tribute to the duo.

In 2005, Columbia released a box set, &quot;My Lives&quot;, which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions, and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the software that permits people to remix &quot;Zanzibar&quot; and a live version of &quot;I Go to Extremes&quot; with their PC. A DVD of a show from the &quot;River of Dreams&quot; tour is included.

On January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not released any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as deep cuts like &quot;Zanzibar&quot; and &quot;All for Leyna&quot;. His tour included an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at Madison Square Garden. The singer&#x27;s stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by Bruce Springsteen, who played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena. The record earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena owned by a non-athlete. This honor has also been given to Joel at the Wells Fargo Center (formerly the Wachovia Center) in Philadelphia, where a banner in the colors of the Philadelphia Flyers is hung honoring Joel&#x27;s 48 sold-out Philadelphia shows. On June 13, 2006, Columbia released &quot;12 Gardens Live&quot;, a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of the 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during Joel&#x27;s 2006 tour.

Joel visited the United Kingdom and Ireland for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour. On July 31, 2006, he performed a free concert in Rome, with the Colosseum as the backdrop.

Joel toured South Africa, Australia, Japan and Hawaii in late 2006, and subsequently toured the Southeastern U.S. in February and March 2007 before hitting the Midwest in the spring of 2007. A new song, titled &quot;All My Life&quot;, was Joel&#x27;s newest single (with second track &quot;You&#x27;re My Home&quot;, live from Madison Square Garden 2006 tour) and was released in stores on February 27, 2007. On February 4, Joel sang the national anthem for Super Bowl XLI, becoming the second to sing the national anthem twice at a Super Bowl, after Aaron Neville.
On December 1, 2007, Joel premiered his new song &quot;Christmas in Fallujah&quot;. The song was performed by Cass Dillon, a new Long Island based musician, as Joel felt it should be sung by someone in a soldier&#x27;s age range (though he himself has played the song occasionally in concert.) The track was dedicated to servicemen based in Iraq. Joel wrote it in September 2007 after reading numerous letters sent to him from American soldiers in Iraq. &quot;Christmas in Fallujah&quot; is only the second pop/rock song released by Joel since 1993&#x27;s &quot;River of Dreams&quot;. Proceeds from the song benefited the Homes For Our Troops foundation.

On January 26, 2008, Joel performed with the Philadelphia Orchestra celebrating the 151st anniversary of the Academy of Music. Joel performed his classical piece &quot;Waltz No. 2 (Steinway Hall)&quot; from &quot;Fantasies &amp; Delusions&quot;, arranged by Brad Ellis. He also played many of his less well-known pieces, with full orchestral backing arranged by Mr. Ellis, including the rarely performed &quot;Nylon Curtain&quot; songs &quot;Scandinavian Skies&quot; and &quot;Where&#x27;s the Orchestra?&quot;.

On March 10, 2008, Joel inducted his friend John Mellencamp into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Joel sold out 10 concerts at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut from May to July 2008. The casino honored him with a banner displaying his name and the number 10 to hang in the arena. On June 19, 2008, he played a concert at the grand re-opening of Caesars Windsor (formerly Casino Windsor) in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, to an invite-only crowd for Casino VIPs. His mood was light and joke-filled, even introducing himself as &quot;Billy Joel&#x27;s dad&quot; and stating &quot;you guys overpaid to see a fat bald guy&quot;. He also admitted that Canadian folk-pop musician Gordon Lightfoot was the musical inspiration for &quot;She&#x27;s Always A Woman&quot;.
On July 16 and 18, 2008, Joel played the final concerts at Shea Stadium before its demolition. His guests included Tony Bennett, Don Henley, John Mayer, John Mellencamp, Steven Tyler, Roger Daltrey, Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney. The concerts were featured in the 2010 documentary film &quot;Last Play at Shea&quot;. The film was released on DVD on February 8, 2011. The CD and DVD of the show, &quot;Live at Shea Stadium&quot;, were released on March 8, 2011.

On December 11, 2008, Joel recorded his own rendition of &quot;Christmas in Fallujah&quot; during a concert at Acer Arena in Sydney and released it as a live single in Australia only. It is the only official release of Joel performing &quot;Christmas in Fallujah&quot;, as Cass Dillon sang on the 2007 studio recording and the handful of times the song was played live in 2007. Joel sang the song throughout his December 2008 tour of Australia.

On May 19, 2009, Joel&#x27;s former drummer, Liberty DeVitto, filed a lawsuit in NYC claiming Joel and Sony Music owed DeVitto over 10 years of royalty payments. DeVitto had never been given songwriting or arranging credit on any of Joel&#x27;s songs, but he claimed that he helped arrange some of them, including &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot;. In April 2010, it was announced that Joel and DeVitto amicably resolved the lawsuit.

2011 marked the 40th anniversary of the release of Joel&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Cold Spring Harbor.&quot; According to Joel&#x27;s official website, to commemorate this anniversary, Columbia/Legacy Recordings originally planned &quot;to celebrate the occasion with a definitive reissue project of newly restored and expanded Legacy editions of Joel&#x27;s complete catalog, newly curated collections of rarities from the vaults, previously unavailable studio tracks and live performances, home video releases and more&quot;, although this never fully came to fruition. &quot;Piano Man&quot; was re-released in a two-disc Legacy edition in November 2011.

In 2012, Joel signed an exclusive worldwide publishing agreement with Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG), and its subsidiary Rondor Music International. Under the agreement, UMPG and Rondor replaced EMI Music Publishing in handling Joel&#x27;s catalog outside the US. Additionally, the agreement marked the first time since Joel regained control of his publishing rights in the 1980s that he began to use an administrator to handle his catalog within the U.S. The agreement&#x27;s focus is on increasing the use of Joel&#x27;s music in movies, television programs and commercials.

On December 12, 2012, Joel performed as part of 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief at Madison Square Garden, a concert held for all the victims of Hurricane Sandy. He changed the lyrics to &quot;Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)&quot; to make it relate to all the damage caused by Sandy.

In May 2013, it was announced that Joel would hold his first ever indoor Irish concert at the O2 in Dublin on November 1. He subsequently announced his return to the UK for the first time in seven years to perform in October and November. Joel played in Manchester and Birmingham as well as London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo. In October, Joel held a surprise concert on Long Island at The Paramount (Huntington, New York) to benefit Long Island Cares. The venue holds a capacity of 1,555 and sold out in five minutes. Joel headlined a solo arena concert in New York City for the first time since 2006 when he performed at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 31, 2013.

=== 2014–present: Madison Square Garden residency and &quot;Turn the Lights Back On&quot; ===
Joel announced a concert residency at Madison Square Garden, playing one concert a month indefinitely, starting January 27, 2014. The first MSG show also launched the Billy Joel in Concert tour, which continued at the Amway Center (in Orlando, Florida) where Joel performed several cover songs such as Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Your Song&quot;, Billy Preston&#x27;s &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot; (in tribute to Joe Cocker), the Beatles&#x27; &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; and &quot;When I&#x27;m 64&quot;, Robert Burns&#x27; &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; and AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; (with Brian Johnson). Joel also performed an unusual set, including the song &quot;Souvenir&quot; (from 1974&#x27;s &quot;Streetlife Serenade&quot;) and excluding &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;.
In 2015, Joel performed 21 concerts in addition to his monthly Madison Square Garden residency. His August 4, 2015, engagement at Nassau Coliseum was the final concert prior to the arena undergoing a US$261 million renovation. Joel returned to Nassau Coliseum on April 5, 2017, to play the first concert at the newly renovated venue. Later that month, he played the first concert at Atlanta&#x27;s new SunTrust Park, the suburban home of the Atlanta Braves. On June 24, 2017, he returned to Hicksville High School fifty years after his would-be graduating class received their diplomas, to deliver the honorary commencement address. It was also the 25th anniversary of receiving his own diploma from the same high school.
In 2019, Joel announced a concert at Camden Yards, home of the Baltimore Orioles, marking the first-ever concert at the baseball stadium. Joel was forced to postpone his concerts between March 2020 and August 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Joel and Stevie Nicks jointly announced plans to perform a series of concerts across the United States in 2023, tentatively beginning with SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles on March 10.
On June 1, 2023, Joel announced that his residency at Madison Square Garden would end in July 2024 with his 104th performance in the series, marking his 150th lifetime performance at the venue. On January 22, 2024, he announced his first new pop single in years (and only his second pop song in more than two decades), &quot;Turn the Lights Back On&quot;, which was released on February 1.

== Other ventures ==

In 1996, Joel merged his long-held love of boating with his desire for a second career. He and Long Island boating businessman Peter Needham formed the Long Island Boat Company.

In November 2010, Joel opened a shop in Oyster Bay, Long Island, to manufacture custom-made, retro-styled motorcycles and accessories.

In 2011, Joel announced that he was releasing an autobiography that he had written with Fred Schruers, titled &quot;The Book of Joel: A Memoir&quot;. The book was originally going to be released in June 2011, but, in March 2011, Joel decided against publishing the book and officially canceled his deal with HarperCollins. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted, &quot;HarperCollins acquired the book project for US$3 million in 2008. Joel is expected to return his advance on that sum to the publisher.&quot; According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;the HarperCollins book was billed as an &#x27;emotional ride&#x27; that would detail the music legend&#x27;s failed marriage to Christie Brinkley, as well as his battles with substance abuse.&quot; In explaining his decision to cancel the book&#x27;s release, Joel said, &quot;It took working on writing a book to make me realize that I&#x27;m not all that interested in talking about the past, and that the best expression of my life and its ups and downs has been and remains my music.&quot; In 2014, Schruers published a biography, simply titled &quot;Billy Joel&quot;, based on his extensive personal interviews with Joel.

== Personal life ==
===Marriages and family===

Joel&#x27;s first wife was Elizabeth Weber Small. When their relationship began, she was married to Jon Small, his music partner in the short-lived duo Attila, with whom she had a son. When the affair was revealed, Weber severed her relationships with both men. Weber and Joel later reconciled and married in 1973, and she then became his manager. They divorced on July 20, 1982.

Joel married a second time, to model Christie Brinkley, in March 1985. Their daughter, Alexa Ray Joel, was born December 29, 1985. Alexa was given the middle name of Ray after Ray Charles, one of Joel&#x27;s musical idols. Joel and Brinkley divorced on August 26, 1994. They remain friends; Joel is the godfather of Brinkley&#x27;s two youngest children Jack and Sailor Brinkley Cook.

On October 2, 2004, Joel married chef Katie Lee, his third wife. At the time of the wedding, Lee was 23 and Joel was 55. Joel&#x27;s daughter, Alexa Ray, then 18, served as maid of honor. Joel&#x27;s second wife, Christie Brinkley, attended the union and gave the couple her blessing. On June 17, 2009, they announced their separation.

On July 4, 2015, Joel married a fourth time, to Alexis Roderick, an equestrian and former Morgan Stanley executive, at his Oyster Bay estate on Long Island. He was 66; she was 33. Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo conducted the ceremony. The couple have been together since 2009. On August 12, 2015, the couple had a daughter, Della Rose Joel. The couple&#x27;s second daughter, Remy Anne Joel, was born on October 22, 2017.

Joel bought an estate in Centre Island, New York in the town of Oyster Bay, in 2002 for US$22 million. He also owns a house in Sag Harbor. In 2023, Joel put his Oyster Bay estate on the market for $49 million. The listing was pulled as the main house was undergoing renovations. The mansion, with its guest houses, pool, beach and helipad on 26 acres, was again offered for sale in September 2024, asking $49.9 million. Joel has ended his 10-year residency at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan in July 2024. His two younger daughters attend school in Florida, where the family now lives.

In 2015, he purchased a home in Manalapan, Florida. The waterfront residence went on the market in November 2015 for $19.5 million but it was taken off the market and re-listed in 2017 with an asking price of $18.5 million. The property was further reduced to $16.9 million in 2018. In January 2020, the 13,200-square-foot property sold for US$10.3 million.

===Health issues===
In 1970, a career decline and personal tragedies led Joel to a deep depressive period. Joel left a suicide note and attempted to end his life by drinking furniture polish. Later he said, &quot;I drank furniture polish. It looked tastier than bleach.&quot; His drummer and bandmate, Jon Small, rushed him to the hospital. Joel checked into Meadowbrook Hospital, where he was put on suicide watch and received treatment for depression. Joel would later pen the song &quot;Tomorrow Is Today&quot;, which he describes as a suicide note.

In 1985, Joel recorded &quot;You&#x27;re Only Human (Second Wind)&quot; as a message to help prevent teen suicide.

In 2002, Joel entered Silver Hill Hospital, a substance abuse and psychiatric center in New Canaan, Connecticut, where he underwent treatment for 10 days. In March 2005, he checked into the Betty Ford Center, where he spent 30 days for the treatment of alcohol abuse.

==Politics==
Although Joel has donated money to Democratic candidates, he has never publicly affiliated himself with the Democratic Party. Joel rarely publicly endorses political candidates; however, he did play a benefit with his friend Bruce Springsteen to raise money for Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2008. He has performed at benefit concerts that have helped raise funds for political causes. However, about celebrities endorsing political candidates, Joel has said, &quot;People who pay for your tickets, I don&#x27;t think they want to hear who you&#x27;re going to vote for and how you think they should vote.&quot; 

In 2016, after his sarcastic dedication of &quot;The Entertainer&quot; to then-Republican candidate Donald Trump was taken as a serious endorsement, Joel told the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; in an email that he would be voting for Hillary Clinton.

<doc id="43931" wikidata="Q1774805" url="?curid=43931" title="Transitive verb">
<text>A transitive verb is a verb that entails one or more transitive objects, for example, &#x27;enjoys&#x27; in &quot;Amadeus enjoys music&quot;. This contrasts with intransitive verbs, which do not entail transitive objects, for example, &#x27;arose&#x27; in &quot;Beatrice arose&quot;. 

Transitivity is traditionally thought of as a global property of a clause, by which activity is transferred from an agent to a patient.

Transitive verbs can be classified by the number of objects they require. Verbs that entail only two arguments, a subject and a single direct object, are monotransitive. Verbs that entail two objects, a direct object and an indirect object, are &quot;ditransitive&quot;, or less commonly &quot;bitransitive&quot;. An example of a ditransitive verb in English is the verb &quot;to give&quot;, which may feature a subject, an indirect object, and a direct object: &quot;John gave Mary the book&quot;.

Verbs that take three objects are &quot;tritransitive&quot;. In English a tritransitive verb features an indirect object, a direct object, and a prepositional phrase – as in &quot;I&#x27;ll trade you this bicycle for your binoculars&quot; – or else a clause that behaves like an argument – as in &quot;I bet you a pound that he has forgotten&quot;. Not all descriptive grammars recognize tritransitive verbs.

A clause with a prepositional phrase that expresses a meaning similar to that usually expressed by an object may be called &quot;pseudo-transitive&quot;. For example, the Indonesian sentences &quot;Dia masuk sekolah&quot; (&quot;He attended school&quot;) and &quot;Dia masuk ke sekolah&quot; (&quot;He went into the school&quot;) have the same verb (&quot;masuk&quot; &quot;enter&quot;), but the first sentence has a direct object while the second has a prepositional phrase in its place. A clause with a direct object plus a prepositional phrase may be called &quot;pseudo-ditransitive&quot;, as in the Lakhota sentence &quot;Haŋpíkčeka kiŋ lená wé-čage&quot; (&quot;I made those moccasins for him&quot;). Such constructions are sometimes called &quot;complex transitive&quot;. The category of complex transitives includes not only prepositional phrases but also dependent clauses, appositives, and other structures. There is some controversy regarding complex transitives and tritransitives; linguists disagree on the nature of the structures.

In contrast to transitive verbs, some verbs take zero objects. Verbs that do not require an object are called intransitive verbs. An example in modern English is the verb &quot;to arrive&quot;.

Verbs that can be used in an intransitive or transitive way are called &quot;ambitransitive verbs&quot;. In English, an example is the verb &quot;to eat&quot;; the sentences &quot;You eat&quot; (with an intransitive form) and &quot;You eat apples&quot; (a transitive form that has &quot;apples&quot; as the object) are both grammatical.

The concept of valency is related to transitivity. The valency of a verb considers all the arguments the verb takes, including both the subject and all of the objects. In contrast to valency, the transitivity of a verb only considers the objects. Subcategorization is roughly synonymous with valency, though they come from different theoretical traditions.

== History ==
Transitive phrases, i.e. phrases containing transitive verbs, were first recognized by the stoics and from the Peripatetic school, but they probably referred to the whole phrase containing the transitive verb, not just to the verb. The advancements of the stoics were later developed by the philologists of the Alexandrian school.

==Lexical vis-à-vis grammatical information==
Traditionally, transitivity patterns are thought of as lexical information of the verb, but recent research in construction grammar and related theories has argued that transitivity is a grammatical rather than a lexical property, since the same verb very often appears with different transitivity in different contexts. Consider:

*Does your dog &quot;bite&quot;? (no object)
*The cat &quot;bit&quot; him. (one object)
*Can you &quot;bite&quot; me off a piece of banana? (two objects)
*The vase &quot;broke&quot;. (no object; anticausative construction)
*She &quot;broke&quot; the toothpick. (one object)
*Can you &quot;break&quot; me some toothpicks for my model castle? (two objects)
*Stop me before I &quot;buy&quot; again. (no object; antipassive construction)
*The man &quot;bought&quot; a ring. (one object)
*The man &quot;bought&quot; his wife a ring. (two objects)

In grammatical construction theories, transitivity is considered as an element of grammatical construction, rather than an inherent part of verbs.

==In English==
The following sentences exemplify transitive verbs in English.
* We&#x27;re going to need a bigger boat.
* You need to fill in this form.
* Hang on, I&#x27;ll have it ready in a minute.
* The professor took off his spectacles.

==Other languages==
In some languages, morphological features separate verbs based on their transitivity, which suggests this is a salient linguistic feature. For example, in Japanese:

However, the definition of transitive verbs as those with one object is not universal, and is not used in grammars of many languages. 

=== In Hungarian ===

Hungarian is sometimes misunderstood to have transitive and intransitive conjugation for all verbs, but there is really only one general conjugation.
In present and future, there is a lesser used variant – a definite, or say emphatic conjugation form. It is used only when referring to a previous sentence, or topic, where the object was already mentioned. Logically the definite article as reference is used here—and due to verb emphasis (definite), word order changes to VO.
*If one does not want to be definite, once can simply say: 
: — I see (a) house – (general)

: — I see the house – (The house we were looking for)

: — I eat (an) apple – (general)

: — I eat the apple – (The one mom told me to)

: — I drink wine – (general)

: — I drink the wine – (That you offered me before)

In English, one would say &#x27;I do see the house&#x27;, etc., stressing the verb – in Hungarian, the object is emphasized – but both mean exactly the same thing.

=== In Pingelapese ===
In the Pingelapese language, transitive verbs are used in one of four of their most common sentence structures. Transitive verbs according to this language have two main characteristics. These characteristics are action verbs and the sentence must contain a direct object. To elaborate, an action verb is a verb that has a physical action associated to its meaning. The sentence must contain a direct object meaning there must be a recipient of said verb. Two entities must be involved when using a transitive sentence. There is also a fixed word order associated with transitive sentences: subject-transitive verb-object. For example: 

Linda (Subject) &quot;e&quot; aesae (transitive verb) Adino (object) This sentence translates to, Linda knows Adino.

=== In Polish ===
It is generally accepted in Polish grammar that transitive verbs are those that:
* Entail a direct object (which is in the accusative, or, for a few verbs, instrumental case in non-negated sentences, and in the genitive case in negated sentences)OR
* Can undergo passive transformation

For example, the verb (to see) is transitive because it satisfies both conditions:

 (Mary sees John; is the accusative form of )&lt;br&gt;
 (John is seen by Mary)&lt;br&gt;

<text>An obligate aerobe is an organism that requires oxygen to grow. Through cellular respiration, these organisms use oxygen to metabolise substances, like sugars or fats, to obtain energy. In this type of respiration, oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor for the electron transport chain. Aerobic respiration has the advantage of yielding more energy (adenosine triphosphate or ATP) than fermentation or anaerobic respiration, but obligate aerobes are subject to high levels of oxidative stress.
== Examples ==
Among organisms, almost all animals, most fungi, and several bacteria are obligate aerobes. Examples of obligately aerobic bacteria include &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; (acid-fast), &quot;Bacillus&quot; (Gram-positive), and &quot;Nocardia asteroides&quot; (Gram-positive). With the exception of the yeasts, most fungi are obligate aerobes. Also, almost all algae are obligate aerobes.

A unique obligate aerobe is &quot;Streptomyces coelicolor&quot; which is gram-positive, soil-dwelling, and belongs to the phylum Actinomycetota. It is unique because the genome of this obligate aerobe encodes numerous enzymes with functions that are usually attributed to anaerobic metabolism in facultatively and strictly anaerobic bacteria.

== Survival strategies ==
When obligate aerobes are in a temporarily oxygen-deprived environment, they need survival strategies to avoid death. Under these conditions, &quot;Mycobacterium smegmatis&quot; can quickly switch between fermentative hydrogen production and hydrogen oxidation with either oxygen or fumarate reduction depending on the availability of electron acceptor. This example is the first time that hydrogen production has been seen in an obligate aerobe. It also confirms the fermentation in a mycobacterium and is evidence that hydrogen plays a role in survival as well as growth.

Problems can also arise in oxygen-rich environments, most commonly attributed to oxidative stress. This occurrence is when there is an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants in the cells of the organism, largely due to pollution and radiation in the environment. Obligate aerobes survive this phenomenon by using the organism&#x27;s immune system to correct the imbalance.

<doc id="43933" wikidata="Q1166153" url="?curid=43933" title="Intransitive verb">
<text>In grammar, an intransitive verb is a verb, aside from an auxiliary verb, whose context does not entail a transitive object. That lack of an object distinguishes intransitive verbs from transitive verbs, which entail one or more objects. Additionally, intransitive verbs are typically considered within a class apart from modal verbs and defective verbs.

==Examples==
In the following sentences, verbs are used without a direct object:
*&quot;Rivers flow.&quot;
*&quot;I sneezed.&quot;
*&quot;My dog ran.&quot;
*&quot;Water evaporates when it&#x27;s hot.&quot;
*&quot;You&#x27;ve grown since I last saw you!&quot;
*&quot;I wonder how long it will be until I see you again after I move.&quot;

The following sentences contain transitive verbs (they entail one or more objects):
*&quot;We watched &quot;a movie&quot; last night.&quot;
*&quot;She&#x27;s making &quot;promises&quot;.&quot;
*&quot;When I said that, my sister smacked &quot;me&quot;.&quot;
*&quot;Santa gave &quot;me&quot; &quot;a present&quot;.&quot;
*&quot;He continuously clicked &quot;his pen&quot; and it was incredibly annoying to me.&quot;

Some verbs, called ambitransitive verbs, may entail objects but do not always require one. Such a verb may be used as intransitive in one sentence, and as transitive in another.

In general, intransitive verbs often involve weather terms, involuntary processes, states, bodily functions, motion, action processes, cognition, sensation, and emotion.

==Valency-changing operations==
The valency of a verb is related to transitivity. Where the transitivity of a verb only considers the objects, the valency of a verb considers all the arguments that correspond to a verb, including both the subject of the verb and all of the objects.

It is possible to change the contextually indicated sense of a verb from transitive to intransitive, and in so doing to change the valency.

In languages that have a passive voice, a transitive verb in the active voice becomes intransitive in the passive voice. For example, consider the following sentence:

In this sentence, &quot;hugged&quot; is a transitive verb with &quot;Mary&quot; as its object. The sentence can be made passive with the direct object &quot;Mary&quot; as the grammatical subject as follows:

This shift is called &quot;promotion&quot; of the object.

The passive-voice construction does not indicate an object. The passivized sentence could be continued with the agent:

It cannot be continued with a direct object to be taken by &quot;was hugged&quot;. For example, it would be ungrammatical to write &quot;Mary was hugged her daughter&quot; to show that Mary and her daughter shared a hug.

Intransitive verbs can be rephrased as passive constructs in some languages. In English, intransitive verbs can be used in the passive voice when a prepositional phrase is included, as in, &quot;The houses were lived in by millions of people.&quot;

Some languages, such as Dutch, have an impersonal passive voice that lets an intransitive verb without a prepositional phrase be passive. In German, a sentence such as &quot;The children sleep&quot; can be made passive to remove the subject and becomes, &quot;They are slept.&quot; However, no addition like &quot;... by the children&quot; is possible in such cases.

In languages with ergative–absolutive alignment, the passive voice (where the object of a transitive verb becomes the subject of an intransitive verb) does not make sense, because the noun associated with the intransitive verb is marked as the object, not as the subject. Instead, these often have an antipassive voice. In this context, the &quot;subject&quot; of a transitive verb is promoted to the &quot;object&quot; of the corresponding intransitive verb. In the context of a nominative–accusative language like English, this promotion is nonsensical because intransitive verbs do not entail objects, they entail subjects. So, the subject of a transitive verb (&quot;I&quot; in &quot;I hug him&quot;) is &quot;also&quot; the subject of the intransitive passive construction (&quot;I was hugged by him&quot;). But in an ergative–absolutive language like Dyirbal, &quot;I&quot; in the transitive &quot;I hug him&quot; would involve the ergative case, but the &quot;I&quot; in &quot;I was hugged&quot; would involve the absolutive, and so by analogy the antipassive construction more closely resembles &quot;*was hugged me&quot;. Thus in this example, the ergative is promoted to the absolutive, and the agent (i.e., &quot;him&quot;), which was formerly marked by the absolutive, is deleted to form the antipassive voice (or is marked in a different way, in the same way that in the English passive voice can still be specified as the agent of the action using &quot;by him&quot; in &quot;I was hugged by him&quot;—for example, Dyirbal puts the agent in the dative case, and Basque retains the agent in the absolutive).

==Ambitransitivity==

In many languages, there are &quot;ambitransitive&quot; verbs, which can occur either in a transitive or intransitive sense. For example, English &quot;play&quot; is ambitransitive, since it is grammatical to say &quot;His son plays&quot;, and it is also grammatical to say &quot;His son plays guitar&quot;. English is rather flexible as regards verb valency, and so it has a high number of ambitransitive verbs; other languages are more rigid and require explicit valency changing operations (voice, causative morphology, etc.) to transform a verb from intransitive to transitive or vice versa.

In some ambitransitive verbs are &quot;ergative verbs&quot; for which the alignment of the syntactic arguments to the semantic roles is exchanged. An example of this is the verb &quot;break&quot; in English.

:(1) &quot; broke .&quot;
:(2) &quot; broke.&quot;

In (1), the verb is transitive, and the subject is the &quot;agent&quot; of the action, i.e. the performer of the action of breaking the cup. In (2), the verb is intransitive and the subject is the &quot;patient&quot; of the action, i.e. it is the thing affected by the action, not the one that performs it. In fact, the patient is the same in both sentences, and sentence (2) is an example of implicit middle voice. This has also been termed an &quot;anticausative&quot;.

Other alternating intransitive verbs in English are &quot;change&quot; and &quot;sink&quot;.

In the Romance languages, these verbs are often called &quot;pseudo-reflexive&quot;, because they are signaled in the same way as reflexive verbs, using the clitic particle &quot;se&quot;. Compare the following (in Spanish):

:(3a) (&quot;The cup broke.&quot;)
:(3b) (&quot;The boat sank.&quot;)
:(4a) (&quot;She looked at herself in the mirror.&quot;)
:(4b) (&quot;The cat washes itself.&quot;)

Sentences (3a) and (3b) show Romance pseudo-reflexive phrases, corresponding to English alternating intransitives. As in &quot;The cup broke&quot;, they are inherently without an agent; their deep structure does not and can not contain one. The action is not reflexive (as in (4a) and (4b)) because it is not performed by the subject; it just happens to it. Therefore, this is not the same as passive voice, where an intransitive verb phrase appears, but there is an implicit agent (which can be made explicit using a complement phrase):

:(5) &quot;The cup was broken (by the child).&quot;
:(6) (&quot;The boat was sunk (by pirates).&quot;)

Other ambitransitive verbs (like &quot;eat&quot;) are not of the alternating type; the subject is always the agent of the action, and the object is simply optional. A few verbs are of both types at once, like &quot;read&quot;: compare &quot;I read&quot;, &quot;I read a magazine&quot;, and &quot;this magazine reads easily&quot;.

Some languages like Japanese have different forms of certain verbs to show transitivity. For example, there are two forms of the verb &quot;to start&quot;:

: (7) 

: (8) 

In Japanese, the form of the verb indicates the number of arguments the sentence needs to have.

==Unaccusative and unergative verbs==

Especially in some languages, it makes sense to classify intransitive verbs as:
*&quot;unaccusative&quot; when the subject is not an agent; that is, it does not actively initiate the action of the verb (e.g. &quot;die&quot;, &quot;fall&quot;).
**Unaccusative verbs are typically used to show action or movement.
***Examples:
****I arrived at the party around 8 o&#x27;clock.
****Do you know what time the plane departed?
****The disease spread to other towns.
****I sat on the train.
****I was in a car accident and the other person appeared out of no where.
*&quot;unergative&quot; when they have an agent subject.
**Examples:
***I am going to resign from my position at the bank.
***I have to run six miles in the morning.
***John ate.

This distinction may in some cases be reflected in the grammar, where for instance different auxiliary verbs may be used for the two categories.

==Cognate objects==

In many languages, including English, some or all intransitive verbs can entail &quot;cognate objects&quot;—objects formed from the same roots as the verbs themselves; for example, the verb &quot;sleep&quot; is ordinarily intransitive, but one can say, &quot;He slept a troubled sleep&quot;, meaning roughly &quot;He slept, and his sleep was troubled.&quot;

== Other languages ==
In Pingelapese, a Micronesian language, intransitive verb sentence structure is often used, with no object attached. There must be a stative or active verb to have an intransitive sentence. A stative verb has a person or an object that is directly influenced by a verb. An active verb has the direct action performed by the subject. The word order that is most commonly associated with intransitive sentences is subject-verb. However, verb-subject is used if the verb is unaccusative or by discourse pragmatics.

In Tokelauan, the noun phrases used with verbs are required when verbs are placed in groups. Verbs are divided into two major groups. Every verbal sentence must have that structure, which contains a singular noun phrase, without a preposition, called an unmarked noun phrase. Only if a &quot;ko&quot;-phrase precedes the predicate, that rule may be ignored. The agent is what speakers of the language call the person who is performing the action of the verb. If a noun phrase that starts with the preposition &quot;e&quot; is able to express the agent, and the receiving person or thing that the agent is performing the action of the verb to is expressed by a singular noun phrase that lack a preposition, or unmarked noun phrase, the verb is then considered transitive. All other verbs are considered intransitive.

<text>A micrometer, sometimes known as a micrometer screw gauge (MSG), is a device incorporating a calibrated screw widely used for accurate measurement of components in mechanical engineering and machining as well as most mechanical trades, along with other metrological instruments such as dial, vernier, and digital calipers. Micrometers are usually, but not always, in the form of calipers (opposing ends joined by a frame). The spindle is a very accurately machined screw and the object to be measured is placed between the spindle and the anvil. The spindle is moved by turning the ratchet knob or thimble until the object to be measured is lightly touched by both the spindle and the anvil.

Micrometers are also used in telescopes and microscopes to measure the apparent diameter of celestial bodies or microscopic objects. The micrometer used with a telescope was invented about 1638 by William Gascoigne, an English astronomer.

==History==
The word &quot;micrometer&quot; is a neoclassical coinage from and . According to the &quot;Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary&quot;, the word was loaned to English from French, with its first known appearance in English writing being in 1670. Neither the metre nor the micrometre (μm) nor the micrometer (device) as we know them today existed at that time. However, the people of that time did have much need for, and interest in, the ability to measure small things and small differences. The word was no doubt coined in reference to this endeavor, even if it did not refer specifically to its present-day senses.

The first ever micrometric screw was invented by William Gascoigne in the 17th century, as an enhancement of the vernier; it was used in a telescope to measure angular distances between stars and the relative sizes of celestial objects.

The London Science Museum contains an exhibit &quot;James Watt&#x27;s end measuring instrument with micrometer screw, 1776&quot; which the science museum claims is probably the first screw micrometer made. This instrument is intended to measure items very accurately by placing them between the two anvils and then advancing one using a fine micrometer screw until both are in contact with the object, the distance between them being precisely recorded on the two dials. However, as the science museum notes, there is a possibility that this instrument was not made c.1776 by Watt, but 1876 when it was placed in that year&#x27;s Special Loan Exhibition of scientific instruments in South Kensington.

Henry Maudslay built a bench micrometer in the early 19th century that was nicknamed &quot;the Lord Chancellor&quot; among his staff because it was the final judge on measurement accuracy and precision in the firm&#x27;s work. In 1844, details of Whitworth&#x27;s workshop micrometer were published. This was described as having a strong frame of cast iron, the opposite ends of which were two highly finished steel cylinders, which traversed longitudinally by action of screws. The ends of the cylinders where they met was of hemispherical shape. One screw was fitted with a wheel graduated to measure to the ten thousandth of an inch. His object was &quot;to furnish ordinary mechanics with an instrument which, while it afforded very accurate indications, was yet not very liable to be deranged by the rough handling of the workshop&quot;.

The first documented development of handheld micrometer-screw calipers was by Jean Laurent Palmer of Paris in 1848; the device is therefore often called &quot;palmer&quot; in French, &quot;tornillo de Palmer&quot; (&quot;Palmer screw&quot;) in Spanish, and &quot;calibro Palmer&quot; (&quot;Palmer caliper&quot;) in Italian. (Those languages also use the &quot;micrometer&quot; cognates: &quot;micromètre, micrómetro, micrometro&quot;.) The micrometer caliper was introduced to the mass market in anglophone countries by Brown &amp; Sharpe in 1867, allowing the penetration of the instrument&#x27;s use into the average machine shop. Brown &amp; Sharpe were inspired by several earlier devices, one of them being Palmer&#x27;s design. In 1888, Edward W. Morley added to the precision of micrometric measurements and proved their accuracy in a complex series of experiments.

The culture of toolroom accuracy and precision, which started with interchangeability pioneers including Gribeauval, Tousard, North, Hall, Whitney, and Colt, and continued through leaders such as Maudslay, Palmer, Whitworth, Brown, Sharpe, Pratt, Whitney, Leland, Johansson, and others, grew during the Machine Age to become an important part of combining applied science with technology. Beginning in the early 20th century, one could no longer truly master tool and die making, machine tool building, or engineering without some knowledge of the science of metrology, as well as the sciences of chemistry and physics (for metallurgy, kinematics/dynamics, and quality).

==Types==
===Specialized types===

Each type of micrometer caliper can be fitted with specialized anvils and spindle tips for particular measuring tasks. For example, the anvil may be shaped in the form of a segment of screw thread, in the form of a v-block, or in the form of a large disc.
* Universal micrometer sets come with interchangeable anvils, such as flat, spherical, spline, disk, blade, point, and knife-edge. The term universal micrometer may also refer to a type of micrometer whose frame has modular components, allowing one micrometer to function as outside mic, depth mic, step mic, etc. (often known by the brand names Mul-T-Anvil and Uni-Mike).
* Blade micrometers have a matching set of narrow tips (blades). They allow, for example, the measuring of a narrow o-ring groove.
* Pitch-diameter micrometers (aka thread mics) have a matching set of thread-shaped tips for measuring the pitch diameter of screw threads.
* Limit mics have two anvils and two spindles, and are used like a snap gauge. The part being checked must pass through the first gap and must stop at the second gap in order to be within specification. The two gaps accurately reflect the top and bottom of the tolerance range.
* Bore micrometer, typically a three-anvil head on a micrometer base used to accurately measure inside diameters.
* Tube micrometers have a cylindrical anvil positioned perpendicularly to a spindle and is used to measure the thickness of tubes.
* Micrometer stops are micrometer heads that are mounted on the table of a manual milling machine, bedways of a lathe, or other machine tool, in place of simple stops. They help the operator to position the table or carriage precisely. Stops can also be used to actuate kickout mechanisms or limit switches to halt an automatic feed system.
* Ball micrometers have ball-shaped (spherical) anvils. They may have one flat and one ball anvil, in which case they are used for measuring tube wall thickness, distance of a hole to an edge, and other distances where one anvil must be placed against a rounded surface. They differ in application from tube micrometers in that they may be used to measure against rounded surfaces which are not tubes, but the ball anvil may also not be able to fit into smaller tubes as easily as a tube micrometer. Ball micrometers with a pair of balls can be used when single-tangential-point contact is desired on both sides. The most common example is in measuring the pitch diameter of screw threads (which is also done with conical anvils or the 3-wire method, the latter of which uses similar geometry as the pair-of-balls approach).
* Bench micrometers are tools for inspection use whose accuracy and precision are around half a micrometre (20 millionths of an inch, &quot;a fifth of a tenth&quot; in machinist jargon) and whose repeatability is around a quarter micrometre (&quot;a tenth of a tenth&quot;). An example is the Pratt &amp; Whitney Supermicrometer brand.
* Digit mics are the type with mechanical digits that roll over.
* Digital mics are the type that uses an encoder to detect the distance and displays the result on a digital screen.
* V mics are outside mics with a small V-block for an anvil. They are useful for measuring the diameter of a circle from three points evenly spaced around it (versus the two points of a standard outside micrometer). An example of when this is necessary is measuring the diameter of 3-flute endmills and twist drills.

==Operating principles==
Micrometers use the screw to transform small distances (that are too small to measure directly) into large rotations of the screw that are big enough to read from a scale. The accuracy of a micrometer derives from the accuracy of the thread-forms that are central to the core of its design. In some cases it is a differential screw. The basic operating principles of a micrometer are as follows:
# The amount of rotation of an accurately made screw can be directly and precisely correlated to a certain amount of axial movement (and vice versa), through the constant known as the screw&#x27;s &quot;lead&quot; (). A screw&#x27;s &quot;lead&quot; is the distance it moves forward axially with one complete turn (360°). (In most threads [that is, in all single-start threads], &quot;lead&quot; and &quot;pitch&quot; refer to essentially the same concept.)
# With an appropriate lead and major diameter of the screw, a given amount of axial movement will be &quot;amplified&quot; in the resulting circumferential movement.

For example, if the lead of a screw is 1 mm, but the major diameter (here, outer diameter) is 10 mm, then the circumference of the screw is 10π, or about 31.4 mm. Therefore, an axial movement of 1 mm is amplified (magnified) to a circumferential movement of 31.4 mm. This amplification allows a small difference in the sizes of two similar measured objects to correlate to a larger difference in the position of a micrometer&#x27;s thimble. In some micrometers, even greater accuracy is obtained by using a differential screw adjuster to move the thimble in much smaller increments than a single thread would allow.

In classic-style analog micrometers, the position of the thimble is read directly from scale markings on the thimble and sleeve (for names of parts see next section). A vernier scale is often included, which allows the position to be read to a fraction of the smallest scale mark. In digital micrometers, an electronic readout displays the length digitally on an LCD on the instrument. There also exist mechanical-digit versions, like the style of car odometers where the numbers &quot;roll over&quot;.

==Parts==
A micrometer is composed of:

==Reading==
Micrometers are high precision instruments. Proper use of them requires not only understanding their operation itself but also the nature of the object and the dynamic between the instrument and the object as it is being measured. For simplicity&#x27;s sake, in the figures and text below issues related to deformation or definition of the length being measured are assumed to be negligible unless otherwise stated.

===Customary/Imperial system===

The spindle of a micrometer graduated for the Imperial and US customary measurement systems has 40 threads per inch, so that one turn moves the spindle axially 0.025 inch (1 ÷ 40 = 0.025), equal to the distance between adjacent graduations on the sleeve. The 25 graduations on the thimble allow the 0.025 inch to be further divided, so that turning the thimble through one division moves the spindle axially 0.001 inch (0.025 ÷ 25 = 0.001). Thus, the reading is given by the number of whole divisions that are visible on the scale of the sleeve, multiplied by 25 (the number of thousandths of an inch that each division represents), plus the number of that division on the thimble which coincides with the axial zero line on the sleeve. The result will be the diameter expressed in thousandths of an inch. As the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., appear below every fourth sub-division on the sleeve, indicating hundreds of thousandths, the reading can easily be taken.

Suppose the thimble were screwed out so that graduation 2, and three additional sub-divisions, were visible on the sleeve (as shown in the image), and that graduation 1 on the thimble coincided with the axial line on the sleeve. The reading would then be 0.2000 + 0.075 + 0.001, or 0.276 inch.

===Metric system===
The spindle of an ordinary metric micrometer has 2 threads per millimetre, and thus one complete revolution moves the spindle through a distance of 0.5 millimeter. The longitudinal line on the sleeve is graduated with 1 millimetre divisions and 0.5 millimetre subdivisions. The thimble has 50 graduations, each being 0.01 millimetre (one-hundredth of a millimetre). Thus, the reading is given by the number of millimetre divisions visible on the scale of the sleeve plus the division on the thimble which coincides with the axial line on the sleeve.

As shown in the image, suppose that the thimble were screwed out so that graduation 5, and one additional 0.5 subdivision were visible on the sleeve. The reading from the axial line on the sleeve almost reaches graduation 28 on the thimble. The best estimate is 27.9 graduations. The reading then would be 5.00 (exact) + 0.5 (exact) + 0.279 (estimate) = 5.779 mm (estimate). As the last digit is an &quot;estimated tenth&quot;, both 5.780 mm and 5.778 mm are also reasonably acceptable readings but the former cannot be written as 5.78 mm or, by the rules for significant figures, it is then taken to express ten times less precision than the instrument actually has! But note that the nature of the object being measured often requires one should round the result to fewer significant figures than which the instrument is capable.

===Vernier micrometers===

Some micrometers are provided with a vernier scale on the sleeve in addition to the regular graduations. These permit measurements within 0.001 millimetre to be made on metric micrometers, or 0.0001 inches on inch-system micrometers.

The additional digit of these micrometers is obtained by finding the line on the sleeve vernier scale which exactly coincides with one on the thimble. The number of this coinciding vernier line represents the additional digit.

Thus, the reading for metric micrometers of this type is the number of whole millimeters (if any) and the number of hundredths of a millimeter, as with an ordinary micrometer, and the number of thousandths of a millimeter given by the coinciding vernier line on the sleeve vernier scale.

For example, a measurement of 5.783 millimetres would be obtained by reading 5.5 millimetres on the sleeve, and then adding 0.28 millimetre as determined by the thimble. The vernier would then be used to read the 0.003 (as shown in the image).

Inch micrometers are read in a similar fashion.

Note: 0.01 millimeter = 0.000393 inch, and 0.002 millimeter = 0.000078 inch (78 millionths) or alternatively, 0.0001 inch = 0.00254 millimeters. Therefore, metric micrometers provide smaller measuring increments than comparable inch unit micrometers—the smallest graduation of an ordinary inch reading micrometer is 0.001 inch; the vernier type has graduations down to 0.0001 inch (0.00254 mm). When using either a metric or inch micrometer, without a vernier, smaller readings than those graduated may of course be obtained by visual interpolation between graduations.

==Calibration: testing and adjusting==

===Zeroing===
On most micrometers, a small pin spanner is used to turn the sleeve relative to the barrel, so that its zero line is repositioned relative to the markings on the thimble. There is usually a small hole in the sleeve to accept the spanner&#x27;s pin. This calibration procedure will cancel a zero error: the problem that the micrometer reads nonzero when its jaws are closed.

===Testing===
A standard one-inch micrometer has readout divisions of 0.001 inch and a rated accuracy of ±0.0001 inch (&quot;one tenth&quot;, in machinist parlance). 
Both the measuring instrument and the object being measured should be at room temperature for an accurate measurement; dirt, operator skill issue, and misuse (or abuse) of the instrument are the main sources of error.

The accuracy of micrometers is checked by using them to measure gauge blocks, rods, or similar standards whose lengths are precisely and accurately known. If the gauge block is known to be 0.75000 ± 0.00005 inch (&quot;seven-fifty plus or minus fifty millionths&quot;, that is, &quot;seven hundred fifty thou plus or minus half a tenth&quot;), then the micrometer should measure it as 0.7500 inch. If the micrometer measures 0.7503 inch, then it is out of calibration. Cleanliness and low (but consistent) torque are especially important when calibrating—each tenth (that is, ten-thousandth of an inch), or hundredth of a millimetre, &quot;counts&quot;; each is important. A mere speck of dirt, or a mere bit too much squeeze, obscures the truth of whether the instrument can read correctly. The solution is simply —cleaning, patience, due care and attention, and repeated measurements (good repeatability assures the calibrator that their technique is working correctly).

Calibration typically checks the error at 3 to 5 points along the range. Only one can be adjusted to zero. If the micrometer is in good condition, then they are all &quot;so near to zero&quot; that the instrument seems to read essentially &quot;-on&quot; all along its range; no noticeable error is seen at any locale. In contrast, on a worn-out micrometer (or one that was poorly made to begin with), one can &quot;chase the error up and down the range&quot;, that is, &quot;move&quot; it up or down to any of various locales along the range, by adjusting the sleeve, but one cannot &quot;eliminate&quot; it from all locales at once.

Calibration can also include the condition of the tips (flat and parallel), ratchet, and linearity of the scale. Flatness and parallelism are typically measured with a gauge called an optical flat, a disc of glass or plastic ground with extreme accuracy to have flat, parallel faces, which allows light bands to be counted when the micrometer&#x27;s anvil and spindle are against it, revealing their amount of geometric inaccuracy.

Commercial machine shops, especially those that do certain categories of work (military or commercial aerospace, nuclear power industry, medical, and others), are required by various standards organizations (such as ISO, ANSI, ASME, ASTM, SAE, AIA, the U.S. military, and others) to calibrate micrometers and other gauges on a schedule (often annually), to affix a label to each gauge that gives it an ID number and a calibration expiration date, to keep a record of all the gauges by ID number, and to specify in inspection reports which gauge was used for a particular measurement.

Not all calibration is an affair for metrology labs. A micrometer can be calibrated on-site anytime, at least in the most basic and important way (if not comprehensively), by measuring a high-grade gauge block and adjusting to match. Even gauges that are calibrated annually and within their expiration timeframe should be checked this way every month or two if they are used daily. They usually will check out OK as needing no adjustment.

The accuracy of the gauge blocks themselves is traceable through a chain of comparisons back to a master standard such as the international prototype of the meter. This bar of metal, like the international prototype of the kilogram, is maintained under controlled conditions at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures headquarters in France, which is one of the principal measurement standards laboratories of the world. These master standards have extreme-accuracy regional copies (kept in the national laboratories of various countries, such as NIST), and metrological equipment makes the chain of comparisons. Because the definition of the meter is now based on a light wavelength, the international prototype of the meter is not quite as indispensable as it once was. But such master gauges are still important for calibrating and certifying metrological equipment. Equipment described as &quot;NIST traceable&quot; means that its comparison against master gauges, and their comparison against others, can be traced back through a chain of documentation to equipment in the NIST labs. Maintaining this degree of traceability requires some expense, which is why NIST-traceable equipment is more expensive than non-NIST-traceable. But applications needing the highest degree of quality control mandate the cost.

===Adjustment===
A micrometer that has been zeroed and tested and found to be off might be restored to accuracy by further adjustment. If the error originates from the parts of the micrometer being worn out of shape and size, then restoration of accuracy by this means is not possible; rather, repair (grinding, lapping, or replacing of parts) is required. For standard kinds of instruments, in practice it is easier and faster, and often no more expensive, to buy a new one rather than pursue refurbishment.

<doc id="43936" wikidata="Q2328313" url="?curid=43936" title="Ditransitive verb">
<text>In grammar, a ditransitive (or bitransitive) verb is a transitive verb whose contextual use corresponds to a subject and two objects which refer to a theme and a recipient. According to certain linguistics considerations, these objects may be called &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot;, or &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot;. This is in contrast to monotransitive verbs, whose contextual use corresponds to only one object.

In languages which mark grammatical case, it is common to differentiate the objects of a ditransitive verb using, for example, the accusative case for the direct object, and the dative case for the indirect object (but this morphological alignment is not unique; see below). In languages without morphological case (such as English for the most part) the objects are distinguished by word order or context.

==In English==
English has a number of generally ditransitive verbs, such as &quot;give&quot;, &quot;grant&quot;, and &quot;tell&quot; and many transitive verbs that can take an additional argument (commonly a beneficiary or target of the action), such as &quot;pass&quot;, &quot;read&quot;, &quot;bake&quot;, etc.:

:&quot;He gave Mary ten dollars.&quot;
:&quot;He passed Paul the ball.&quot;
:&quot;Jean read him the books.&quot;
:&quot;She is baking him a cake.&quot;
:&quot;I am mailing Sam some lemons.&quot;

Alternatively, English grammar allows for these sentences to be written with a preposition (&quot;to&quot; or &quot;for&quot;): (See also Dative shift)

:&quot;He gave ten dollars to Mary.&quot;
:&quot;He passed the ball to Paul.&quot;
:&quot;Jean read the books to/for him.&quot;
:&quot;She is baking a cake for him.&quot;
:&quot;I am mailing some lemons to Sam.&quot;, etc.

The latter form is grammatically correct in every case, but in some dialects the former (without a preposition) is considered ungrammatical, or at least unnatural-sounding, when the direct object is a pronoun (as in &quot;He gave me it&quot; or &quot;He gave Fred it&quot;).

Sometimes one of the forms is perceived as wrong for idiosyncratic reasons (idioms tend to be fixed in form) or the verb simply dictates one of the patterns and excludes the other:

:&quot;*Give a break to me&quot; (grammatical, but always phrased &quot;Give me a break&quot;)
:&quot;*He introduced Susan his brother&quot; (usually phrased &quot;He introduced his brother to Susan&quot;)

In certain dialects of English, many verbs not normally treated as ditransitive are allowed to take a second object that shows a beneficiary, generally of an action performed for oneself.

:&quot;Let&#x27;s catch ourselves some fish&quot; (which might also be phrased &quot;Let&#x27;s catch some fish for ourselves&quot;)

This construction could also be an extension of a reflexive construction.

In addition, certain ditransitive verbs can also act as monotransitive verbs:

:&quot;David told a story to &quot;the children&quot;&quot; – Ditransitive
:&quot;David told &quot;a story&quot; – Monotransitive

===Passive voice===

Many ditransitive verbs have a passive voice form which can take a direct object. Contrast the active and two forms of the passive:

Active:
:&quot;Jean gave the books to him.&quot;
:&quot;Jean gave him the books.&quot;

Passive:
:&quot;The books were given to him by Jean.&quot;
:&quot;He was given the books by Jean.&quot;

Not all languages have a passive voice, and some that do have one (e.g. Polish) do not allow the indirect object of a ditransitive verb to be promoted to subject by passivization, as English does. In others like Dutch a passivization is possible but requires a different auxiliary: &quot;krijgen&quot; instead of &quot;worden&quot;.

E.g. &quot;schenken&quot; means &quot;to donate, to give&quot;:

:Active: &quot;Jan schonk hem de boeken&quot; – John donated the books to him.
:Passive: &quot;De boeken werden door Jan aan hem geschonken&quot; – The books were donated to him by John.
:Pseudo-passive: &quot;Hij kreeg de boeken door Jan geschonken&quot; – He got the books donated [to him] by John.

===Attributive ditransitive verbs===

Another category of ditransitive verb is the attributive ditransitive verb in which the two objects are semantically an entity and a quality, a source and a result, etc. These verbs attribute one object to the other. In English, &quot;make&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;appoint&quot;, &quot;consider&quot;, &quot;turn into&quot; and others are examples:

*&quot;The state of New York made Hillary Clinton a Senator.&quot;
*&quot;I will name him Galahad.&quot;

The first object is a direct object. The second object is an object complement.

Attributive ditransitive verbs are also referred to as resultative verbs.

==Morphosyntactic alignment==
The morphosyntactic alignment between arguments of monotransitive and ditransitive verbs is explained below. If the three arguments of a typical ditransitive verb are labeled D (for Donor; the subject of a verb like &quot;to give&quot; in English), T (for Theme; normally the direct object of ditransitive verb in English) and R (for Recipient, normally the indirect object in English), these can be aligned with the Agent and Patient of monotransitive verbs and the Subject of intransitive verbs in several ways, which are not predicted by whether the language is nominative–accusative, ergative–absolutive, or active–stative. Donor is always or nearly always in the same case as Agent, but different languages equate the other arguments in different ways:

* Indirective languages: D = A, T = P, with a third case for R
* Secundative languages: D = A, R = P (the &#x27;primary object&#x27;), with a third case for T (the &#x27;secondary object&#x27;)
* Neutral or double-object languages: D = A, T = R = P
* Split-P languages: D = A, some monotransitive clauses have P = T, others have P = R

<doc id="43937" wikidata="Q186517" url="?curid=43937" title="Parasitism">
<text>Parasitism is a close relationship between species, where one organism, the parasite, lives (at least some of the time) on or inside another organism, the host, causing it some harm, and is adapted structurally to this way of life. The entomologist E. O. Wilson characterised parasites&#x27; way of feeding as &quot;predators that eat prey in units of less than one&quot;. Parasites include single-celled protozoans such as the agents of malaria, sleeping sickness, and amoebic dysentery; animals such as hookworms, lice, mosquitoes, and vampire bats; fungi such as honey fungus and the agents of ringworm; and plants such as mistletoe, dodder, and the broomrapes.

There are six major parasitic strategies of exploitation of animal hosts, namely parasitic castration, directly transmitted parasitism (by contact), parasitism (by being eaten), vector-transmitted parasitism, parasitoidism, and micropredation. One major axis of classification concerns invasiveness: an endoparasite lives inside the host&#x27;s body; an ectoparasite lives outside, on the host&#x27;s surface.

Like predation, parasitism is a type of consumer–resource interaction, but unlike predators, parasites, with the exception of parasitoids, are much smaller than their hosts, do not kill them, and often live in or on their hosts for an extended period. Parasites of animals are highly specialised, each parasite species living on one given animal species, and reproduce at a faster rate than their hosts. Classic examples include interactions between vertebrate hosts and tapeworms, flukes, and those between the malaria-causing &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species, and fleas.

Parasites reduce host fitness by general or specialised pathology, that ranges from parasitic castration to modification of host behaviour. Parasites increase their own fitness by exploiting hosts for resources necessary for their survival, in particular by feeding on them and by using intermediate (secondary) hosts to assist in their transmission from one definitive (primary) host to another. Although parasitism is often unambiguous, it is part of a spectrum of interactions between species, grading via parasitoidism into predation, through evolution into mutualism, and in some fungi, shading into being saprophytic.

Human knowledge of parasites such as roundworms and tapeworms dates back to ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. In early modern times, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek observed &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot; with his microscope in 1681, while Francesco Redi described internal and external parasites including sheep liver fluke and ticks. Modern parasitology developed in the 19th century. In human culture, parasitism has negative connotations. These were exploited to satirical effect in Jonathan Swift&#x27;s 1733 poem &quot;On Poetry: A Rhapsody&quot;, comparing poets to hyperparasitical &quot;vermin&quot;. In fiction, Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 Gothic horror novel &quot;Dracula&quot; and its many later adaptations featured a blood-drinking parasite. Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot; was one of many works of science fiction to feature a parasitic alien species.

== Etymology ==

First used in English in 1539, the word &quot;parasite&quot; comes from the Medieval French , from the Latinised form , . The related term &quot;parasitism&quot; appears in English from 1611.

== Evolutionary strategies ==


=== Basic concepts ===

Parasitism is a kind of symbiosis, a close and persistent long-term biological interaction between a parasite and its host. Unlike saprotrophs, parasites feed on living hosts, though some parasitic fungi, for instance, may continue to feed on hosts they have killed. Unlike commensalism and mutualism, the parasitic relationship harms the host, either feeding on it or, as in the case of intestinal parasites, consuming some of its food. Because parasites interact with other species, they can readily act as vectors of pathogens, causing disease. Predation is by definition not a symbiosis, as the interaction is brief, but the entomologist E. O. Wilson has characterised parasites as &quot;predators that eat prey in units of less than one&quot;.

Within that scope are many possible strategies. Taxonomists classify parasites in a variety of overlapping schemes, based on their interactions with their hosts and on their life cycles, which can be complex. An obligate parasite depends completely on the host to complete its life cycle, while a facultative parasite does not. Parasite life cycles involving only one host are called &quot;direct&quot;; those with a definitive host (where the parasite reproduces sexually) and at least one intermediate host are called &quot;indirect&quot;. An endoparasite lives inside the host&#x27;s body; an ectoparasite lives outside, on the host&#x27;s surface. Mesoparasites—like some copepods, for example—enter an opening in the host&#x27;s body and remain partly embedded there. Some parasites can be generalists, feeding on a wide range of hosts, but many parasites, and the majority of protozoans and helminths that parasitise animals, are specialists and extremely host-specific. An early basic, functional division of parasites distinguished microparasites and macroparasites. These each had a mathematical model assigned in order to analyse the population movements of the host–parasite groupings. The microorganisms and viruses that can reproduce and complete their life cycle within the host are known as microparasites. Macroparasites are the multicellular organisms that reproduce and complete their life cycle outside of the host or on the host&#x27;s body.

Much of the thinking on types of parasitism has focused on terrestrial animal parasites of animals, such as helminths. Those in other environments and with other hosts often have analogous strategies. For example, the snubnosed eel is probably a facultative endoparasite (i.e., it is semiparasitic) that opportunistically burrows into and eats sick and dying fish. Plant-eating insects such as scale insects, aphids, and caterpillars closely resemble ectoparasites, attacking much larger plants; they serve as vectors of bacteria, fungi and viruses which cause plant diseases. As female scale insects cannot move, they are obligate parasites, permanently attached to their hosts.

The sensory inputs that a parasite employs to identify and approach a potential host are known as &quot;host cues&quot;. Such cues can include, for example, vibration, exhaled carbon dioxide, skin odours, visual and heat signatures, and moisture. Parasitic plants can use, for example, light, host physiochemistry, and volatiles to recognize potential hosts.

=== Major strategies ===

There are six major parasitic strategies, namely parasitic castration; directly transmitted parasitism; -transmitted parasitism; vector-transmitted parasitism; parasitoidism; and micropredation. These apply to parasites whose hosts are plants as well as animals. These strategies represent adaptive peaks; intermediate strategies are possible, but organisms in many different groups have consistently converged on these six, which are evolutionarily stable.

A perspective on the evolutionary options can be gained by considering four key questions: the effect on the fitness of a parasite&#x27;s hosts; the number of hosts they have per life stage; whether the host is prevented from reproducing; and whether the effect depends on intensity (number of parasites per host). From this analysis, the major evolutionary strategies of parasitism emerge, alongside predation.

Parasitic castrators partly or completely destroy their host&#x27;s ability to reproduce, diverting the energy that would have gone into reproduction into host and parasite growth, sometimes causing gigantism in the host. The host&#x27;s other systems remain intact, allowing it to survive and to sustain the parasite. Parasitic crustaceans such as those in the specialised barnacle genus &quot;Sacculina&quot; specifically cause damage to the gonads of their many species of host crabs. In the case of &quot;Sacculina&quot;, the testes of over two-thirds of their crab hosts degenerate sufficiently for these male crabs to develop female secondary sex characteristics such as broader abdomens, smaller claws and egg-grasping appendages. Various species of helminth castrate their hosts (such as insects and snails). This may happen directly, whether mechanically by feeding on their gonads, or by secreting a chemical that destroys reproductive cells; or indirectly, whether by secreting a hormone or by diverting nutrients. For example, the trematode &quot;Zoogonus lasius&quot;, whose sporocysts lack mouths, castrates the intertidal marine snail &quot;Tritia obsoleta&quot; chemically, developing in its gonad and killing its reproductive cells.

==== Directly transmitted ====


Directly transmitted parasites, not requiring a vector to reach their hosts, include such parasites of terrestrial vertebrates as lice and mites; marine parasites such as copepods and cyamid amphipods; monogeneans; and many species of nematodes, fungi, protozoans, bacteria, and viruses. Whether endoparasites or ectoparasites, each has a single host-species. Within that species, most individuals are free or almost free of parasites, while a minority carry a large number of parasites; this is known as an aggregated distribution.

==== Trophically transmitted ====

-transmitted parasites are transmitted by being eaten by a host. They include trematodes (all except schistosomes), cestodes, acanthocephalans, pentastomids, many roundworms, and many protozoa such as &quot;Toxoplasma&quot;. They have complex life cycles involving hosts of two or more species. In their juvenile stages they infect and often encyst in the intermediate host. When the intermediate-host animal is eaten by a predator, the definitive host, the parasite survives the digestion process and matures into an adult; some live as intestinal parasites. Many trophically transmitted parasites modify the behaviour of their intermediate hosts, increasing their chances of being eaten by a predator. As with directly transmitted parasites, the distribution of trophically transmitted parasites among host individuals is aggregated. Coinfection by multiple parasites is common. Autoinfection, where (by exception) the whole of the parasite&#x27;s life cycle takes place in a single primary host, can sometimes occur in helminths such as &quot;Strongyloides stercoralis&quot;.

==== Vector-transmitted ====

Vector-transmitted parasites rely on a third party, an intermediate host, where the parasite does not reproduce sexually, to carry them from one definitive host to another. These parasites are microorganisms, namely protozoa, bacteria, or viruses, often intracellular pathogens (disease-causers). Their vectors are mostly hematophagic arthropods such as fleas, lice, ticks, and mosquitoes. For example, the deer tick &quot;Ixodes scapularis&quot; acts as a vector for diseases including Lyme disease, babesiosis, and anaplasmosis. Protozoan endoparasites, such as the malarial parasites in the genus &quot;Plasmodium&quot; and sleeping-sickness parasites in the genus &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;, have infective stages in the host&#x27;s blood which are transported to new hosts by biting insects.

==== Parasitoids ====

Parasitoids are insects which sooner or later kill their hosts, placing their relationship close to predation. Most parasitoids are parasitoid wasps or other hymenopterans; others include dipterans such as phorid flies. They can be divided into two groups, idiobionts and koinobionts, differing in their treatment of their hosts.

Idiobiont parasitoids sting their often-large prey on capture, either killing them outright or paralysing them immediately. The immobilised prey is then carried to a nest, sometimes alongside other prey if it is not large enough to support a parasitoid throughout its development. An egg is laid on top of the prey and the nest is then sealed. The parasitoid develops rapidly through its larval and pupal stages, feeding on the provisions left for it.

Koinobiont parasitoids, which include flies as well as wasps, lay their eggs inside young hosts, usually larvae. These are allowed to go on growing, so the host and parasitoid develop together for an extended period, ending when the parasitoids emerge as adults, leaving the prey dead, eaten from inside. Some koinobionts regulate their host&#x27;s development, for example preventing it from pupating or making it moult whenever the parasitoid is ready to moult. They may do this by producing hormones that mimic the host&#x27;s moulting hormones (ecdysteroids), or by regulating the host&#x27;s endocrine system.

==== Micropredators ====

A micropredator attacks more than one host, reducing each host&#x27;s fitness by at least a small amount, and is only in contact with any one host intermittently. This behavior makes micropredators suitable as vectors, as they can pass smaller parasites from one host to another. Most micropredators are hematophagic, feeding on blood. They include annelids such as leeches, crustaceans such as branchiurans and gnathiid isopods, various dipterans such as mosquitoes and tsetse flies, other arthropods such as fleas and ticks, vertebrates such as lampreys, and mammals such as vampire bats.

=== Transmission strategies ===

Parasites use a variety of methods to infect animal hosts, including physical contact, the fecal–oral route, free-living infectious stages, and vectors, suiting their differing hosts, life cycles, and ecological contexts. Examples to illustrate some of the many possible combinations are given in the table.

=== Variations ===

Among the many variations on parasitic strategies are hyperparasitism, social parasitism, brood parasitism, kleptoparasitism, sexual parasitism, and adelphoparasitism.

==== Hyperparasitism ====

Hyperparasites feed on another parasite, as exemplified by protozoa living in helminth parasites, or facultative or obligate parasitoids whose hosts are either conventional parasites or parasitoids. Levels of parasitism beyond secondary also occur, especially among facultative parasitoids. In oak gall systems, there can be up to four levels of parasitism.

Hyperparasites can control their hosts&#x27; populations, and are used for this purpose in agriculture and to some extent in medicine. The controlling effects can be seen in the way that the CHV1 virus helps to control the damage that chestnut blight, &quot;Cryphonectria parasitica&quot;, does to American chestnut trees, and in the way that bacteriophages can limit bacterial infections. It is likely, though little researched, that most pathogenic microparasites have hyperparasites which may prove widely useful in both agriculture and medicine.

==== Social parasitism ====

Social parasites take advantage of interspecific interactions between members of eusocial animals such as ants, termites, and bumblebees. Examples include the large blue butterfly, &quot;Phengaris arion&quot;, its larvae employing ant mimicry to parasitise certain ants, &quot;Bombus bohemicus&quot;, a bumblebee which invades the hives of other bees and takes over reproduction while their young are raised by host workers, and &quot;Melipona scutellaris&quot;, a eusocial bee whose virgin queens escape killer workers and invade another colony without a queen. An extreme example of interspecific social parasitism is found in the ant &quot;Tetramorium inquilinum&quot;, an obligate parasite which lives exclusively on the backs of other &quot;Tetramorium&quot; ants. A mechanism for the evolution of social parasitism was first proposed by Carlo Emery in 1909. Now known as &quot;Emery&#x27;s rule&quot;, it states that social parasites tend to be closely related to their hosts, often being in the same genus.

Intraspecific social parasitism occurs in parasitic nursing, where some individual young take milk from unrelated females. In wedge-capped capuchins, higher ranking females sometimes take milk from low ranking females without any reciprocation.

==== Brood parasitism ====

In brood parasitism, the hosts suffer increased parental investment and energy expenditure to feed parasitic young, which are commonly larger than host young. The growth rate of host nestlings is slowed, reducing the host&#x27;s fitness. Brood parasites include birds in different families such as cowbirds, whydahs, cuckoos, and black-headed ducks. These do not build nests of their own, but leave their eggs in nests of other species. In the family &quot;Cuculidae&quot;, over 40% of cuckoo species are obligate brood parasites, while others are either facultative brood parasites or provide parental care. The eggs of some brood parasites mimic those of their hosts, while some cowbird eggs have tough shells, making them hard for the hosts to kill by piercing, both mechanisms implying selection by the hosts against parasitic eggs. The adult female European cuckoo further mimics a predator, the European sparrowhawk, giving her time to lay her eggs in the host&#x27;s nest unobserved. Host species often combat parasitic egg mimicry through egg polymorphism, having two or more egg phenotypes within a single population of a species. Multiple phenotypes in host eggs decrease the probability of a parasitic species accurately &quot;matching&quot; their eggs to host eggs.

==== Kleptoparasitism ====

In kleptoparasitism (from Greek κλέπτης (&quot;kleptēs&quot;), &quot;thief&quot;), parasites steal food gathered by the host. The parasitism is often on close relatives, whether within the same species or between species in the same genus or family. For instance, the many lineages of cuckoo bees lay their eggs in the nest cells of other bees in the same family. Kleptoparasitism is uncommon generally but conspicuous in birds; some such as skuas are specialised in pirating food from other seabirds, relentlessly chasing them down until they disgorge their catch.

==== Sexual parasitism ====

A unique approach is seen in some species of anglerfish, such as &quot;Ceratias holboelli&quot;, where the males are reduced to tiny sexual parasites, wholly dependent on females of their own species for survival, permanently attached below the female&#x27;s body, and unable to fend for themselves. The female nourishes the male and protects him from predators, while the male gives nothing back except the sperm that the female needs to produce the next generation.

==== Adelphoparasitism ====

Adelphoparasitism, (from Greek (&quot;adelphós&quot;), brother), also known as sibling-parasitism, occurs where the host species is closely related to the parasite, often in the same family or genus. In the citrus blackfly parasitoid, &quot;Encarsia perplexa&quot;, unmated females may lay haploid eggs in the fully developed larvae of their own species, producing male offspring, while the marine worm &quot;Bonellia viridis&quot; has a similar reproductive strategy, although the larvae are planktonic.

==== Illustrations ====

Examples of the major variant strategies are illustrated.

== Taxonomic range ==

Parasitism has an extremely wide taxonomic range, including animals, plants, fungi, protozoans, bacteria, and viruses.

=== Animals ===

Parasitism is widespread in the animal kingdom, and has evolved independently from free-living forms hundreds of times. Many types of helminth including flukes and cestodes have complete life cycles involving two or more hosts. By far the largest group is the parasitoid wasps in the Hymenoptera. The phyla and classes with the largest numbers of parasitic species are listed in the table. Numbers are conservative minimum estimates. The columns for Endo- and Ecto-parasitism refer to the definitive host, as documented in the Vertebrate and Invertebrate columns.

=== Plants ===

A hemiparasite or &quot;partial parasite&quot; such as mistletoe derives some of its nutrients from another living plant, whereas a holoparasite such as &quot;Cuscuta&quot; derives all of its nutrients from another plant. Parasitic plants make up about one per cent of angiosperms and are in almost every biome in the world. All these plants have modified roots, haustoria, which penetrate the host plants, connecting them to the conductive system—either the xylem, the phloem, or both. This provides them with the ability to extract water and nutrients from the host. A parasitic plant is classified depending on where it latches onto the host, either the stem or the root, and the amount of nutrients it requires. Since holoparasites have no chlorophyll and therefore cannot make food for themselves by photosynthesis, they are always obligate parasites, deriving all their food from their hosts. Some parasitic plants can locate their host plants by detecting chemicals in the air or soil given off by host shoots or roots, respectively. About 4,500 species of parasitic plant in approximately 20 families of flowering plants are known.

Species within the &quot;Orobanchaceae&quot; (broomrapes) are among the most economically destructive of all plants. Species of &quot;Striga&quot; (witchweeds) are estimated to cost billions of dollars a year in crop yield loss, infesting over 50 million hectares of cultivated land within Sub-Saharan Africa alone. &quot;Striga&quot; infects both grasses and grains, including corn, rice, and sorghum, which are among the world&#x27;s most important food crops. &quot;Orobanche&quot; also threatens a wide range of other important crops, including peas, chickpeas, tomatoes, carrots, and varieties of cabbage. Yield loss from &quot;Orobanche&quot; can be total; despite extensive research, no method of control has been entirely successful.

Many plants and fungi exchange carbon and nutrients in mutualistic mycorrhizal relationships. Some 400 species of myco-heterotrophic plants, mostly in the tropics, however effectively cheat by taking carbon from a fungus rather than exchanging it for minerals. They have much reduced roots, as they do not need to absorb water from the soil; their stems are slender with few vascular bundles, and their leaves are reduced to small scales, as they do not photosynthesize. Their seeds are small and numerous, so they appear to rely on being infected by a suitable fungus soon after germinating.

=== Fungi ===

Parasitic fungi derive some or all of their nutritional requirements from plants, other fungi, or animals.

Plant pathogenic fungi are classified into three categories depending on their mode of nutrition: biotrophs, hemibiotrophs and necrotrophs. Biotrophic fungi derive nutrients from living plant cells, and during the course of infection they colonise their plant host in such a way as to keep it alive for a maximally long time. One well-known example of a biotrophic pathogen is &quot;Ustilago maydis&quot;, causative agent of the corn smut disease. Necrotrophic pathogens on the other hand, kill host cells and feed saprophytically, an example being the root-colonising honey fungi in the genus &quot;Armillaria.&quot; Hemibiotrophic pathogens begin their colonising their hosts as biotrophs, and subsequently killing off host cells and feeding as necrotrophs, a phenomenon termed the biotrophy-necrotrophy switch.

Pathogenic fungi are well-known causative agents of diseases on animals as well as humans. Fungal infections (mycosis) are estimated to kill 1.6 million people each year. One example of a potent fungal animal pathogen are Microsporidia - obligate intracellular parasitic fungi that largely affect insects, but may also affect vertebrates including humans, causing the intestinal infection microsporidiosis.

=== Protozoa ===

Protozoa such as &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;, and &quot;Entamoeba&quot; are endoparasitic. They cause serious diseases in vertebrates including humans—in these examples, malaria, sleeping sickness, and amoebic dysentery—and have complex life cycles.

=== Bacteria ===

Many bacteria are parasitic, though they are more generally thought of as pathogens causing disease. Parasitic bacteria are extremely diverse, and infect their hosts by a variety of routes. To give a few examples, &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, the cause of anthrax, is spread by contact with infected domestic animals; its spores, which can survive for years outside the body, can enter a host through an abrasion or may be inhaled. &quot;Borrelia&quot;, the cause of Lyme disease and relapsing fever, is transmitted by vectors, ticks of the genus &quot;Ixodes&quot;, from the diseases&#x27; reservoirs in animals such as deer. &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot;, a cause of gastroenteritis, is spread by the fecal–oral route from animals, or by eating insufficiently cooked poultry, or by contaminated water. &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, an agent of bacterial meningitis and respiratory tract infections such as influenza and bronchitis, is transmitted by droplet contact. &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot;, the cause of syphilis, is spread by sexual activity.

=== Viruses ===

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, characterised by extremely limited biological function, to the point where, while they are evidently able to infect all other organisms from bacteria and archaea to animals, plants and fungi, it is unclear whether they can themselves be described as living. They can be either RNA or DNA viruses consisting of a single or double strand of genetic material (RNA or DNA, respectively), covered in a protein coat and sometimes a lipid envelope. They thus lack all the usual machinery of the cell such as enzymes, relying entirely on the host cell&#x27;s ability to replicate DNA and synthesise proteins. Most viruses are bacteriophages, infecting bacteria.

== Evolutionary ecology ==

Parasitism is a major aspect of evolutionary ecology; for example, almost all free-living animals are host to at least one species of parasite. Vertebrates, the best-studied group, are hosts to between 75,000 and 300,000 species of helminths and an uncounted number of parasitic microorganisms. On average, a mammal species hosts four species of nematode, two of trematodes, and two of cestodes. Humans have 342 species of helminth parasites, and 70 species of protozoan parasites. Some three-quarters of the links in food webs include a parasite, important in regulating host numbers. Perhaps 40 per cent of described species are parasitic.

=== Fossil record ===

Parasitism is hard to demonstrate from the fossil record, but holes in the mandibles of several specimens of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; may have been caused by &quot;Trichomonas&quot;-like parasites. &quot;Saurophthirus&quot;, the Early Cretaceous flea, parasitized pterosaurs. Eggs that belonged to nematode worms and probably protozoan cysts were found in the Late Triassic coprolite of phytosaur. This rare find in Thailand reveals more about the ecology of prehistoric parasites.

=== Coevolution ===

As hosts and parasites evolve together, their relationships often change. When a parasite is in a sole relationship with a host, selection drives the relationship to become more benign, even mutualistic, as the parasite can reproduce for longer if its host lives longer. But where parasites are competing, selection favours the parasite that reproduces fastest, leading to increased virulence. There are thus varied possibilities in host–parasite coevolution.

Evolutionary epidemiology analyses how parasites spread and evolve, whereas Darwinian medicine applies similar evolutionary thinking to non-parasitic diseases like cancer and autoimmune conditions.

==== Long-term partnerships favouring mutualism ====

Long-term partnerships can lead to a relatively stable relationship tending to commensalism or mutualism, as, all else being equal, it is in the evolutionary interest of the parasite that its host thrives. A parasite may evolve to become less harmful for its host or a host may evolve to cope with the unavoidable presence of a parasite—to the point that the parasite&#x27;s absence causes the host harm. For example, although animals parasitised by worms are often clearly harmed, such infections may also reduce the prevalence and effects of autoimmune disorders in animal hosts, including humans. In a more extreme example, some nematode worms cannot reproduce, or even survive, without infection by &quot;Wolbachia&quot; bacteria.

Lynn Margulis and others have argued, following Peter Kropotkin&#x27;s 1902 &quot;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution&quot;, that natural selection drives relationships from parasitism to mutualism when resources are limited. This process may have been involved in the symbiogenesis which formed the eukaryotes from an intracellular relationship between archaea and bacteria, though the sequence of events remains largely undefined.

==== Competition favouring virulence ====

Competition between parasites can be expected to favour faster reproducing and therefore more virulent parasites, by natural selection.

Among competing parasitic insect-killing bacteria of the genera &quot;Photorhabdus&quot; and &quot;Xenorhabdus&quot;, virulence depended on the relative potency of the antimicrobial toxins (bacteriocins) produced by the two strains involved. When only one bacterium could kill the other, the other strain was excluded by the competition. But when caterpillars were infected with bacteria both of which had toxins able to kill the other strain, neither strain was excluded, and their virulence was less than when the insect was infected by a single strain.

==== Cospeciation ====

A parasite sometimes undergoes cospeciation with its host, resulting in the pattern described in Fahrenholz&#x27;s rule, that the phylogenies of the host and parasite come to mirror each other.

An example is between the simian foamy virus (SFV) and its primate hosts. The phylogenies of SFV polymerase and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II from African and Asian primates were found to be closely congruent in branching order and divergence times, implying that the simian foamy viruses cospeciated with Old World primates for at least 30 million years.

The presumption of a shared evolutionary history between parasites and hosts can help elucidate how host taxa are related. For instance, there has been a dispute about whether flamingos are more closely related to storks or ducks. The fact that flamingos share parasites with ducks and geese was initially taken as evidence that these groups were more closely related to each other than either is to storks. However, evolutionary events such as the duplication, or the extinction of parasite species (without similar events on the host phylogeny) often erode similarities between host and parasite phylogenies. In the case of flamingos, they have similar lice to those of grebes. Flamingos and grebes do have a common ancestor, implying cospeciation of birds and lice in these groups. Flamingo lice then switched hosts to ducks, creating the situation which had confused biologists.

Parasites infect sympatric hosts (those within their same geographical area) more effectively, as has been shown with digenetic trematodes infecting lake snails. This is in line with the Red Queen hypothesis, which states that interactions between species lead to constant natural selection for coadaptation. Parasites track the locally common hosts&#x27; phenotypes, so the parasites are less infective to allopatric hosts, those from different geographical regions.

=== Modifying host behaviour ===


Some parasites modify host behaviour in order to increase their transmission between hosts, often in relation to predator and prey (parasite increased trophic transmission). For example, in the California coastal salt marsh, the fluke &quot;Euhaplorchis californiensis&quot; reduces the ability of its killifish host to avoid predators. This parasite matures in egrets, which are more likely to feed on infected killifish than on uninfected fish. Another example is the protozoan &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, a parasite that matures in cats but can be carried by many other mammals. Uninfected rats avoid cat odors, but rats infected with &quot;T. gondii&quot; are drawn to this scent, which may increase transmission to feline hosts. The malaria parasite modifies the skin odour of its human hosts, increasing their attractiveness to mosquitoes and hence improving the chance for the parasite to be transmitted. The spider &quot;Cyclosa argenteoalba&quot; often have parasitoid wasp larvae attached to them which alter their web-building behavior. Instead of producing their normal sticky spiral shaped webs, they made simplified webs when the parasites were attached. This manipulated behavior lasted longer and was more prominent the longer the parasites were left on the spiders.

=== Trait loss ===

Parasites can exploit their hosts to carry out a number of functions that they would otherwise have to carry out for themselves. Parasites which lose those functions then have a selective advantage, as they can divert resources to reproduction. Many insect ectoparasites including bedbugs, batbugs, lice and fleas have lost their ability to fly, relying instead on their hosts for transport. Trait loss more generally is widespread among parasites. An extreme example is the myxosporean &quot;Henneguya zschokkei&quot;, an ectoparasite of fish and the only animal known to have lost the ability to respire aerobically: its cells lack mitochondria.

=== Host defences ===

Hosts have evolved a variety of defensive measures against their parasites, including physical barriers like the skin of vertebrates, the immune system of mammals, insects actively removing parasites, and defensive chemicals in plants.

The evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton suggested that sexual reproduction could have evolved to help to defeat multiple parasites by enabling genetic recombination, the shuffling of genes to create varied combinations. Hamilton showed by mathematical modelling that sexual reproduction would be evolutionarily stable in different situations, and that the theory&#x27;s predictions matched the actual ecology of sexual reproduction. However, there may be a trade-off between immunocompetence and breeding male vertebrate hosts&#x27; secondary sex characteristics, such as the plumage of peacocks and the manes of lions. This is because the male hormone testosterone encourages the growth of secondary sex characteristics, favouring such males in sexual selection, at the price of reducing their immune defences.

==== Vertebrates ====

The physical barrier of the tough and often dry and waterproof skin of reptiles, birds and mammals keeps invading microorganisms from entering the body. Human skin also secretes sebum, which is toxic to most microorganisms. On the other hand, larger parasites such as trematodes detect chemicals produced by the skin to locate their hosts when they enter the water. Vertebrate saliva and tears contain lysozyme, an enzyme that breaks down the cell walls of invading bacteria. Should the organism pass the mouth, the stomach with its hydrochloric acid, toxic to most microorganisms, is the next line of defence. Some intestinal parasites have a thick, tough outer coating which is digested slowly or not at all, allowing the parasite to pass through the stomach alive, at which point they enter the intestine and begin the next stage of their life. Once inside the body, parasites must overcome the immune system&#x27;s serum proteins and pattern recognition receptors, intracellular and cellular, that trigger the adaptive immune system&#x27;s lymphocytes such as T cells and antibody-producing B cells. These have receptors that recognise parasites.

==== Insects ====

Insects often adapt their nests to reduce parasitism. For example, one of the key reasons why the wasp &quot;Polistes canadensis&quot; nests across multiple combs, rather than building a single comb like much of the rest of its genus, is to avoid infestation by tineid moths. The tineid moth lays its eggs within the wasps&#x27; nests and then these eggs hatch into larvae that can burrow from cell to cell and prey on wasp pupae. Adult wasps attempt to remove and kill moth eggs and larvae by chewing down the edges of cells, coating the cells with an oral secretion that gives the nest a dark brownish appearance.

==== Plants ====

Plants respond to parasite attack with a series of chemical defences, such as polyphenol oxidase, under the control of the jasmonic acid-insensitive (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathways. The different biochemical pathways are activated by different attacks, and the two pathways can interact positively or negatively. In general, plants can either initiate a specific or a non-specific response. Specific responses involve recognition of a parasite by the plant&#x27;s cellular receptors, leading to a strong but localised response: defensive chemicals are produced around the area where the parasite was detected, blocking its spread, and avoiding wasting defensive production where it is not needed. Non-specific defensive responses are systemic, meaning that the responses are not confined to an area of the plant, but spread throughout the plant, making them costly in energy. These are effective against a wide range of parasites. When damaged, such as by lepidopteran caterpillars, leaves of plants including maize and cotton release increased amounts of volatile chemicals such as terpenes that signal they are being attacked; one effect of this is to attract parasitoid wasps, which in turn attack the caterpillars.
== Biology and conservation ==

=== Ecology and parasitology ===

Parasitism and parasite evolution were until the twenty-first century studied by parasitologists, in a science dominated by medicine, rather than by ecologists or evolutionary biologists. Even though parasite-host interactions were plainly ecological and important in evolution, the history of parasitology caused what the evolutionary ecologist Robert Poulin called a &quot;takeover of parasitism by parasitologists&quot;, leading ecologists to ignore the area. This was in his opinion &quot;unfortunate&quot;, as parasites are &quot;omnipresent agents of natural selection&quot; and significant forces in evolution and ecology. In his view, the long-standing split between the sciences limited the exchange of ideas, with separate conferences and separate journals. The technical languages of ecology and parasitology sometimes involved different meanings for the same words. There were philosophical differences, too: Poulin notes that, influenced by medicine, &quot;many parasitologists accepted that evolution led to a decrease in parasite virulence, whereas modern evolutionary theory would have predicted a greater range of outcomes&quot;.

Their complex relationships make parasites difficult to place in food webs: a trematode with multiple hosts for its various life cycle stages would occupy many positions in a food web simultaneously, and would set up loops of energy flow, confusing the analysis. Further, since nearly every animal has (multiple) parasites, parasites would occupy the top levels of every food web.

Parasites can play a role in the proliferation of non-native species. For example, invasive green crabs are minimally affected by native trematodes on the Eastern Atlantic coast. This helps them outcompete native crabs such as the Atlantic Rock and Jonah crabs.

Ecological parasitology can be important to attempts at control, like during the campaign for eradicating the Guinea worm. Even though the parasite was eradicated in all but four countries, the worm began using frogs as an intermediary host before infecting dogs, making control more difficult than it would have been if the relationships had been better understood.

=== Rationale for conservation ===

Although parasites are widely considered to be harmful, the eradication of all parasites would not be beneficial. Parasites account for at least half of life&#x27;s diversity; they perform important ecological roles; and without parasites, organisms might tend to asexual reproduction, diminishing the diversity of traits brought about by sexual reproduction. Parasites provide an opportunity for the transfer of genetic material between species, facilitating evolutionary change. Many parasites require multiple hosts of different species to complete their life cycles and rely on predator-prey or other stable ecological interactions to get from one host to another. The presence of parasites thus indicates that an ecosystem is healthy.

An ectoparasite, the California condor louse, &quot;Colpocephalum californici&quot;, became a well-known conservation issue. A large and costly captive breeding program was run in the United States to rescue the California condor. It was host to a louse, which lived only on it. Any lice found were &quot;deliberately killed&quot; during the program, to keep the condors in the best possible health. The result was that one species, the condor, was saved and returned to the wild, while another species, the parasite, became extinct.

Although parasites are often omitted in depictions of food webs, they usually occupy the top position. Parasites can function like keystone species, reducing the dominance of superior competitors and allowing competing species to co-exist.

===Quantitative ecology===

A single parasite species usually has an aggregated distribution across host animals, which means that most hosts carry few parasites, while a few hosts carry the vast majority of parasite individuals. This poses considerable problems for students of parasite ecology, as it renders parametric statistics as commonly used by biologists invalid. Log-transformation of data before the application of parametric test, or the use of non-parametric statistics is recommended by several authors, but this can give rise to further problems, so quantitative parasitology is based on more advanced biostatistical methods.

== History ==

=== Ancient ===

Human parasites including roundworms, the Guinea worm, threadworms and tapeworms are mentioned in Egyptian papyrus records from 3000 BC onwards; the Ebers Papyrus describes hookworm. In ancient Greece, parasites including the bladder worm are described in the Hippocratic Corpus, while the comic playwright Aristophanes called tapeworms &quot;hailstones&quot;. The Roman physicians Celsus and Galen documented the roundworms &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot; and &quot;Enterobius vermicularis&quot;.

=== Medieval ===

In his &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot;, completed in 1025, the Persian physician Avicenna recorded human and animal parasites including roundworms, threadworms, the Guinea worm and tapeworms.

In his 1397 book &quot;Traité de l&#x27;état, science et pratique de l&#x27;art de la Bergerie&quot; (Account of the state, science and practice of the art of shepherding), wrote the first description of a trematode endoparasite, the sheep liver fluke &quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot;.

=== Early modern ===

In the early modern period, Francesco Redi&#x27;s 1668 book &quot;Esperienze Intorno alla Generazione degl&#x27;Insetti&quot; (&quot;Experiences of the Generation of Insects&quot;), explicitly described ecto- and endoparasites, illustrating ticks, the larvae of nasal flies of deer, and sheep liver fluke. Redi noted that parasites develop from eggs, contradicting the theory of spontaneous generation. In his 1684 book &quot;Osservazioni intorno agli animali viventi che si trovano negli animali viventi&quot; (&quot;Observations on Living Animals found in Living Animals&quot;), Redi described and illustrated over 100 parasites including the large roundworm in humans that causes ascariasis. Redi was the first to name the cysts of &quot;Echinococcus granulosus&quot; seen in dogs and sheep as parasitic; a century later, in 1760, Peter Simon Pallas correctly suggested that these were the larvae of tapeworms.

In 1681, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek observed and illustrated the protozoan parasite &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot;, and linked it to &quot;his own loose stools&quot;. This was the first protozoan parasite of humans to be seen under a microscope. A few years later, in 1687, the Italian biologists Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo and Diacinto Cestoni described scabies as caused by the parasitic mite &quot;Sarcoptes scabiei&quot;, marking it as the first disease of humans with a known microscopic causative agent.

=== Parasitology ===

Modern parasitology developed in the 19th century with accurate observations and experiments by many researchers and clinicians; the term was first used in 1870. In 1828, James Annersley described amoebiasis, protozoal infections of the intestines and the liver, though the pathogen, &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;, was not discovered until 1873 by Friedrich Lösch. James Paget discovered the intestinal nematode &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot; in humans in 1835. James McConnell described the human liver fluke, &quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot;, in 1875. Algernon Thomas and Rudolf Leuckart independently made the first discovery of the life cycle of a trematode, the sheep liver fluke, by experiment in 1881–1883. In 1877 Patrick Manson discovered the life cycle of the filarial worms that cause elephantiasis transmitted by mosquitoes. Manson further predicted that the malaria parasite, &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, had a mosquito vector, and persuaded Ronald Ross to investigate. Ross confirmed that the prediction was correct in 1897–1898. At the same time, Giovanni Battista Grassi and others described the malaria parasite&#x27;s life cycle stages in &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquitoes. Ross was controversially awarded the 1902 Nobel prize for his work, while Grassi was not. In 1903, David Bruce identified the protozoan parasite and the tsetse fly vector of African trypanosomiasis.

=== Vaccine ===

Given the importance of malaria, with some 220 million people infected annually, many attempts have been made to interrupt its transmission. Various methods of malaria prophylaxis have been tried including the use of antimalarial drugs to kill off the parasites in the blood, the eradication of its mosquito vectors with organochlorine and other insecticides, and the development of a malaria vaccine. All of these have proven problematic, with drug resistance, insecticide resistance among mosquitoes, and repeated failure of vaccines as the parasite mutates. The first and as of 2015 the only licensed vaccine for any parasitic disease of humans is RTS,S for &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; malaria.

=== Biological control ===

Several groups of parasites, including microbial pathogens and parasitoidal wasps have been used as biological control agents in agriculture and horticulture.

=== Resistance ===

Poulin observes that the widespread prophylactic use of anthelmintic drugs in domestic sheep and cattle constitutes a worldwide uncontrolled experiment in the life-history evolution of their parasites. The outcomes depend on whether the drugs decrease the chance of a helminth larva reaching adulthood. If so, natural selection can be expected to favour the production of eggs at an earlier age. If on the other hand the drugs mainly affects adult parasitic worms, selection could cause delayed maturity and increased virulence. Such changes appear to be underway: the nematode &quot;Teladorsagia circumcincta&quot; is changing its adult size and reproductive rate in response to drugs.

== Cultural significance ==

=== Classical times ===

In the classical era, the concept of the parasite was not strictly pejorative: the &quot;parasitus&quot; was an accepted role in Roman society, in which a person could live off the hospitality of others, in return for &quot;flattery, simple services, and a willingness to endure humiliation&quot;.

=== Society ===

Parasitism has a derogatory sense in popular usage. According to the immunologist John Playfair,
The satirical cleric Jonathan Swift alludes to hyperparasitism in his 1733 poem &quot;On Poetry: A Rhapsody&quot;, comparing poets to &quot;vermin&quot; who &quot;teaze and pinch their foes&quot;:

A 2022 study examined the naming of some 3000 parasite species discovered in the previous two decades. Of those named after scientists, over 80% were named for men, whereas about a third of authors of papers on parasites were women. The study found that the percentage of parasite species named for relatives or friends of the author has risen sharply in the same period.

=== Fiction ===

In Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 Gothic horror novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, and its many film adaptations, the eponymous Count Dracula is a blood-drinking parasite (a vampire). The critic Laura Otis argues that as a &quot;thief, seducer, creator, and mimic, Dracula is the ultimate parasite. The whole point of vampirism is sucking other people&#x27;s blood—living at other people&#x27;s expense.&quot;

Disgusting and terrifying parasitic alien species are widespread in science fiction, as for instance in Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot;. In one scene, a Xenomorph bursts out of the chest of a dead man, with blood squirting out under high pressure assisted by explosive squibs. Animal organs were used to reinforce the shock effect. The scene was filmed in a single take, and the startled reaction of the actors was genuine.

The entomopathogenic fungus &quot;Cordyceps&quot; is represented culturally as a deadly threat to the human race. The video game series &quot;The Last of Us&quot; (2013–present) and its television adaptation present &quot;Cordyceps&quot; as a parasite of humans, causing a zombie apocalypse. Its human hosts initially become violent &quot;infected&quot; beings, before turning into blind zombie &quot;clickers&quot;, complete with fruiting bodies growing out from their faces.

<text>Bacterial lawn is a term used by microbiologists to describe the appearance of bacterial colonies when all the individual colonies on a Petri dish or agar plate merge to form a field or mat of bacteria. Bacterial lawns find use in screens for antibiotic resistance and bacteriophage titering.

Bacterial lawns (often of &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot;) are also used extensively when as an assay method when using bacteriophage as tracers in studies of groundwater flow.

Although occasionally used as a synonym for biofilm, the term primarily applies to the simple, clonal, unstructured mats of organisms that typically only form on laboratory growth media. Biofilms—the aggregated form of microorganisms most commonly found in nature— are generally more complex and diverse and marked by larger quantities of extracellular structural matrix relative to the cellular biomass.

== Techniques ==
Bacterial lawns can be produced manually by evenly spreading a high amount of bacteria onto an agar plate using a sterile cotton swab or a Drigalski spatula. Alternatively an automated machine can be used such as a spiral plater where the plate is rotated and the sample is spread evenly using an automated dispenser.

They may also be produced using the &quot;pour plate&quot; technique in which a concentrated inoculum of the appropriate bacteria are mixed with melted agar and spread evenly over the surface of a Petri dish.

<text>Windows Media Player (WMP, officially referred to as Windows Media Player Legacy to distinguish it from the new Windows Media Player introduced with Windows 11) is the first media player and media library application that Microsoft developed to play audio and video on personal computers. It has been a component of the Microsoft Windows operating system, including Windows 9x, Windows NT, Pocket PC, and Windows Mobile. Microsoft also released editions of Windows Media Player for classic Mac OS, , and Solaris, but has since discontinued them.

In addition to being a media player, the app can rip audio file from compact discs, burn Audio CDs or MP3 CDs, synchronize content with a digital audio player or mobile devices, and stream media over the local network. Originally, it could connect to a number of online music stores, allowing its users to purchase digital music. The default file formats are Windows Media Video (WMV), Windows Media Audio (WMA), and Advanced Systems Format (ASF), and its own XML based playlist format called Windows Playlist (WPL). The player is also able to utilize a digital rights management service in the form of Windows Media DRM.

Windows Media Player is a unique component, in that since 1999, each version of Windows came with two or more versions of it side-by-side. For example, Media Player versions 5.1, 6.4, and 8 were all included in Windows XP. Each versions of Windows may bundle several other media playback apps, namely ActiveMovie Control, CD Player, DVD Player, Windows Media Center, and Microsoft Movies &amp; TV.

Windows Media Player 11 is the last out-of-band version of Media Player. It was made available for Windows XP and is included in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Version 12 was released in 2009 along with Windows 7 and has not been made available for previous versions of Windows nor has it been updated ever since. Windows 8 bundled Windows Media Player 12 along two other media player apps, namely Xbox Video and Xbox Music. The latter was renamed Groove Music in Windows 10, and then finally Media Player in Windows 11 which has also been backported to Windows 10.

==History==

The first version of Windows Media Player appeared in October 1991, when Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions was released. Originally called Media Player, this component was included with &quot;Multimedia PC&quot;-compatible machines but not available for retail sale. It was capable of playing codice_1 animation files, and could be extended to support other formats. It used MCI to handle media files. Being a component of Windows, Media Player shows the same version number as that of the version Windows with which it was included.

Microsoft continually produced new programs to play media files. In November of the following year, Video for Windows was introduced with the ability to play digital video files in an AVI container format, with codec support for RLE and Video1, and support for playing uncompressed files. Indeo 3.2 was added in a later release. Video for Windows was first available as a free add-on to Windows 3.1, and later integrated into Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. In 1995, Microsoft released ActiveMovie with DirectX Media SDK. ActiveMovie incorporates a new way of dealing with media files, and adds support for streaming media (which the original Media Player could not handle). In 1996, ActiveMovie was renamed DirectShow. However, Media Player continued to come with Windows until Windows XP, in which it was officially renamed Windows Media Player v5.1. (&quot;v5.1&quot; is the version number of Windows XP).

In 1999, Windows Media Player&#x27;s versioning broke away from that of Windows itself. Windows Media Player 6.x came as an out-of-band update for Windows 95-98 and Windows NT 4.0 that co-existed with Media Player and became a built-in component of Windows 98 SE and Windows 2000 with an &quot;mplayer2.exe&quot; stub allowing to use this built-in instead of newer versions. Windows Media Player 7.0 and its successors also came with an &quot;wmplayer.exe&quot; stub, replacing each other but leaving Media Player and Windows Media Player 6.4 intact. Windows Me and Windows XP is the operating systems to have three different versions of Windows Media Player side by side. All versions branded Windows Media Player (instead of simply Media Player) support DirectShow codecs. Windows Media Player version 7 was a large revamp, with a new user interface, visualizations and increased functionality. Windows Vista, however, dropped older versions of Windows Media Player in favor of v11, which included the removal of the Windows Media Source Filter (DirectShow codec).

In 2004, Microsoft launched digital music store MSN Music for new Windows Media Player 10 to compete with Apple iTunes.
However, MSN Music was discontinued already in 2006 with the launch of Zune music players.

Beginning with Windows Vista, Windows Media Player supports the Media Foundation framework besides DirectShow; as such it plays certain types of media using Media Foundation as well as some types of media using DirectShow. Windows Media Player 12 was released with Windows 7. It included support for more media formats and added new features. With Windows 8, however, the player did not receive an upgrade.

On April 16, 2012, Microsoft announced that Windows Media Player would not be included in Windows RT, the line of Windows designed to run on ARM-based devices.

== Windows Media Player (2022) ==
A different app called Media Player is the successor to Groove Music (previously Xbox Music) and Windows Media Player. Media Player started to be offered to all Windows 11 users on February 15, 2022, with Windows 10 users following in January 2023.

The new Windows Media Player can also play video, as part of Groove&#x27;s rebranding from a music streaming service to a media player. Other changes include the album cover view being in fullscreen, and a refresh to the mini player. Accessibility has also been optimized, with some improved keyboard shortcuts and hotkey support for keyboard users and with other assistive technologies.

==Features==

===Core playback and library functions===
Windows Media Player supports playback of audio, video and pictures, along with fast forward, reverse, file markers (if present) and variable playback speed (seek &amp; time compression/dilation introduced in WMP 9 Series). It supports local playback, streaming playback with multicast streams and progressive downloads. Items in a playlist can be skipped over temporarily at playback time without removing them from the playlist. Full keyboard-based operation is possible in the player.

Windows Media Player supports full media management, via the integrated media library introduced first in version 7, which offers cataloguing and searching of media and viewing media metadata. Media can be arranged according to album, artist, genre, date &quot;et al.&quot; Windows Media Player 9 Series introduced Quick Access Panel to browse and navigate the entire library through a menu. The Quick Access Panel was also added to the mini-mode in version 10 but was entirely removed in version 11. WMP 9 Series also introduced ratings and Auto Ratings. Windows Media Player 10 introduced support for aggregating pictures, Recorded TV shows, and other media into the library. A fully featured tag editor was featured in versions 9-11 of WMP, called the Advanced Tag Editor. However, the feature was removed in Windows Media Player 12. Since WMP 9 Series, the player features dynamically updated &quot;Auto Playlists&quot; based on criteria. Auto Playlists are updated every time users open them. WMP 9 Series and later also supports &quot;Auto Ratings&quot; which automatically assigns ratings based on the number of times a song is played. Pre-populated auto playlists are included in Windows Media Player 9 Series. Custom Auto Playlists can be created only on Windows XP and later.

In Windows Media Player 11, the &quot;Quick Access Panel&quot; was removed and replaced with an Explorer-style navigation pane on the left which can be customized for each library to show the user selected media or metadata categories, with contents appearing on the right, in a graphical manner with thumbnails featuring album art or other art depicting the item. Missing album art can be added directly to the placeholders in the Library itself (though the program re-renders all album art imported this way into 1x1 pixel ratio, 200x200 resolution JPEGs). There are separate &quot;Tiles&quot;, &quot;Icons&quot;, &quot;Details&quot; or &quot;Extended Tiles&quot; views for &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Pictures&quot;, &quot;Video&quot; and &quot;Recorded TV&quot; which can be set individually from the navigation bar. Entries for &quot;Pictures&quot; and &quot;Video&quot; show their thumbnails. Version 11 also introduced the ability to search and display results on-the-fly as characters are being entered, without waiting for &quot;Enter&quot; key to be hit. Incremental search results are refined based on further characters that are typed. &quot;Stacking&quot; allows graphical representations of how many albums there are in a specific category or folder. The pile appears larger as the category contains more albums. The List pane includes an option to prompt the user to remove items skipped in a playlist upon save or skip them only during playback.

===Visualizations===

While playing music, Windows Media Player can show visualizations. The current three visualizations are Alchemy, which was first introduced in version 9, Bars and Waves, which has been used since version 7, and Battery, introduced version 8. Versions 7 and 8 included with Me and XP respectively includes an additional visualization called &quot;Musical Colors&quot;, which is not present in out-of-band releases of version 7 as well as version 9 onwards, but is retained if Windows Media Player was upgraded from version 7 or 8. Version 11 and above refrains from having the former &quot;Ambience,&quot; &quot;Particle,&quot; &quot;Plenoptic,&quot; and &quot;Spikes&quot; visualizations from versions 7 to 10. The reason for their removal was that the visualizations do not support full screen controls (either the visualization gets shifted to the left while there is a thick black bar to the right side of the screen, or that there are no full screen controls). More visualizations such as &quot;BlazingColors,&quot; &quot;ColorCubes,&quot; &quot;PulsingColors,&quot; &quot;Softie the Snowman,&quot; and &quot;Yule Log&quot; were originally offered as optional extras in version 7 and were later made downloadable from Microsoft&#x27;s official website, however the downloads have since been taken down. As of today, they can still be found on some websites such as the WMP Goodies site.

===Format support===
The player includes intrinsic support for Windows Media codecs and also WAV and MP3 media formats. On Windows XP and above with WMP 9 Series and later, the Windows Media Audio Professional codec is included which supports multichannel audio at up to 24-bit 192 kHz resolution. Windows Media Player 11 includes the Windows Media Format 11 runtime which adds low bitrate support (below 128 kbit/s for WMA Pro), support for ripping music to &quot;WMA Pro 10&quot; and updates the original WMA to version 9.2.

Support for any media codec and container format can be added using specific DirectShow filters or Media Foundation codecs (Media Foundation codecs only in Windows Vista and later). The player will not play MP3 files that contain compressed ID3 headers (&quot;tags&quot;), trying to do so results in a &quot;The input media file is invalid&quot; error message. MP3 playback support was built-in beginning with version 6.1 and audio CD playback was natively supported with version 7.

DVD playback features minus the necessary decoders were integrated into Windows Media Player 8 for Windows XP. The player activates DVD and Blu-ray playback functionality with support for menus, titles and chapters, parental controls and audio track language selection if compatible decoders are installed. MPEG-2 and Dolby Digital (AC-3) decoders were included beginning with Windows Media Player 11 on Windows Vista (Home Premium and Ultimate editions only) and Windows 7 (Home Premium, Ultimate, or Enterprise editions) to allow DVD playback without additional software. However, the decoders were subsequently removed in Windows 8 and Windows 10 due to licensing costs.

Windows Media Player 12 adds native support for H.264 and MPEG-4 Part 2 video formats, ALAC, AAC audio and 3GP, MP4 and MOV container formats. Windows Media Player 12 is also able to play AVCHD formats (&quot;.M2TS&quot; and &quot;.mts&quot;).

As of Windows 10, Windows Media Player 12 can play FLAC, HEVC, and SubRip subtitle, and Matroska container formats. Although the WebM file type is not officially associated with Windows Media Player 12 (the default player is Microsoft Movies &amp; TV), playback of VP9 video in WebM container is possible on Windows 10 version 1809 and later.

====Windows Media Player Mobile====
Windows Media Player Mobile 10 on Windows Mobile 6.5 supports MP3, ASF, WMA, and WMV using WMV or MPEG-4 codecs.

===Disc burning, ripping, and playback===
Windows Media Player features integrated Audio CD-burning support since version 7 as well as data CD burning support since Windows Media Player 9 Series on Windows XP and later. Data CDs can have any of the media formats supported by the player. While burning Data CDs, the media can, optionally, be transcoded into WMA format and playlists can be added to the CD as well. Starting with WMP 9 Series, audio CDs can be burnt with volume leveling.

Audio CDs can be ripped as WMA or WMA 10 Pro (WMA 10 Pro in WMP 11 and later) at 48, 64, 96, 128, 160, and 192 kbit/s, WMA lossless (470 to 940 kbit/s) (9 Series on XP and later), WMA variable bitrate (from 40 to 75 kbit/s up to 240-355 kbit/s), MP3 at 128, 192, 256, and 320 kbit/s, or uncompressed WAV (WAV ripping in WMP 11 and later). Since WMP 9 Series, 20 bit high-resolution CDs (HDCDs) are also supported, if capable audio hardware is present. Audio can be ripped using error correction and ripped audio can be protected with Windows Media DRM. Ripping to MP3 is supported only in Windows Media Player 8 for Windows XP and later if a compatible MP3 encoder is installed. Windows Media Player 10 included the Fraunhofer MP3 Professional encoder. Information on CDs such as album name, artist and track listings can optionally be automatically downloaded from the online Windows Media database when the CD is inserted. Version 11 added support for ripping audio CDs to WAV and WMA 10 Pro formats. With their 2015 implementation in Windows 10, Version 12 also added lossless FLAC and ALAC formats for ripping and playback. For burning, version 11 shows a graphical bar indicating how much space will be used on the disc and introduced &quot;Disc spanning&quot; which splits a burn list onto multiple discs in case the content does not fit on one disc.

===Portable device sync===
Windows Media Player allows the user to connect, share and sync data with portable handheld devices and game consoles since version 7. Media can be optionally transcoded to a format better suited for the target device, automatically, when synchronizing. When deleting playlists from devices, Windows Media Player can automatically remove their contents. Devices can be formatted using Windows Media Player 9 Series and later. Version 10 and later support the Media Transfer Protocol and Auto Sync. Auto Sync allows users to specify criteria such as recently added music or highest rated songs, by which media will be automatically synchronized with the portable device and other advanced features like setting the clock on the portable device automatically, communicating with the device to retrieve the user&#x27;s preferences. Windows Media Player 10 also introduced the UMDF-based &quot;Windows Portable Devices&quot; API.

Version 11 has improved synchronization features for loading content onto PlaysForSure-compatible portable players. WMP 11 supports reverse-synchronization, by which media present on the portable device can be replicated back to the PC. &quot;Shuffle Sync&quot; can be used to randomize content synced with the portable device, &quot;Multi PC Sync&quot; to synchronize portable device content across multiple PCs and &quot;Guest Sync&quot; to synchronize different content from multiple PCs with the portable device. Portable devices appear in the navigation pane of the library where their content can be browsed and searched.

Windows Media Player&#x27;s &#x27;Sync&#x27; function has options that allow it to be set to automatically down-convert (transcode) high bit-rate song files to a lower bit-rate. This down-conversion function is switched on by default. This is useful for providing low bit-rate files to those portable devices that need them, and to save space on portable devices with smaller storage capacities. For high bit-rate capable devices with sufficient storage capabilities, the down conversion process can be omitted.

In versions 11 (2006) and 12 (2009), the Quality settings that the user has selected in the Windows Media Player settings for Sync, for that specific portable device, are used to control the quality (bit-rate) of files that are copied to the portable device. Leaving the Quality settings to Automatic will often result in 192kbs files being copied to the portable device. Manual settings can also be made. 192kbs is the highest quality down-conversion bit-rate that can be manually selected when the Sync function&#x27;s down-conversion function is turned on. Lower bit-rates can also be selected.

For portable devices that can handle high bit-rate files, the best quality files are obtained by leaving the down-conversion process switched off (unchecked) for that specific device. In Windows Media Player Version 11, switching off the down-conversion function is done in the Quality tab of the Advanced Options of the Sync settings for the device. In Windows Media Player Version 12, switching off the down-conversion function is done in the Quality tab of the Properties for the device in the Select Settings for the device in the Sync Options menu.

When set up in such a way, Windows Media Player&#x27;s &#x27;Sync&#x27; function can be used to sync unchanged high bit-rate song files to suitable portable devices (i.e. those capable of using file formats such as WMA Lossless, mp3-360kbs, etc.). For example, some users have created large song libraries on their PCs containing .wma formatted song files using the high bit-rate WMA Lossless (WMA-LL) protocol, or using other high bit-rate song file formats. The WMA-LL protocol is selectable in Windows Media Player as an option when ripping songs from CDs. The resulting bit-rates seen on ripped WMA-LL files are often 3 to 6 times higher than 192kbs, and can typically fall anywhere in the range of 600kbs to 1200kbs, depending on the quality of the source file that was present on the CD in the first place. The sound quality is much improved over the default rate, although the file size is larger.

At the time that Versions 11 and 12 were released, the capabilities and capacities of portable devices typically required down-conversion of the bit-rates of the files placed on the portable devices. Thus, Sync down-conversion was turned on by default. This was to ensure playability of the files and to ensure that the file sizes were small enough to efficiently fit a reasonably large selection of songs on the portable device.

In recent years (circa 2012), portable devices became available that could natively play these Windows Media Player produced high bit-rate WMA-LL files (and others), and that have storage capacities suitable for large collections of high bit-rate song files. This made it much more practicable and desirable to use software programs such as Windows Media Player to synchronize previously PC-bound libraries of high bit-rate songs to these new portable devices.

===Enhanced playback features===
Windows Media Player features universal brightness, contrast, saturation and hue adjustments and pixel aspect ratio for supported video formats. It also includes a 10-band graphic equalizer with presets and SRS WOW audio post-processing system. Windows Media Player can also have attached audio and video DSP plug-ins which process the output audio or video data. &quot;Video Smoothing&quot; was introduced in WMP 9 Series (Windows XP and later only) which upscales frame-rate by interpolating added frames, in effect giving a smoother playback on low-framerate videos. The player supports subtitles and closed-captioning for local media, video on demand streaming or live streaming scenarios. Typically Windows Media captions support the SAMI file format but can also carry embedded closed caption data.

The player can use video overlays or VMR (Video Mixing Renderer) surfaces, if the video card supports them. In Windows XP, it uses VMR7 by default, but can also be made to use the more advanced YUV mixing mode by enabling the &quot;Use high quality mode&quot; option in Advanced Performance settings. This turns on deinterlacing, scaling and improved color accuracy. WMP 9 Series introduced native playback for deinterlacing for TV output. Version 9 introduced DXVA accelerated playback. Version 11 introduced improved support for DirectX accelerated decoding of WMV video (DXVA decoding). Up to version 11, it supported static lyrics and &quot;Synchronized Lyrics,” by which different lines of lyrics can be time-stamped, so that they display only at those times. Synchronized Lyrics also were accessible through the Advanced Tag Editor which was removed in version 12.

Since Windows Media Player 9 Series, the player supports crossfading, audio dynamic range (Quiet Mode) for WMA Pro and WMA Lossless, and auto volume leveling for certain media which includes volume level/gain information such as MP3 or Windows Media. The player also supports extensive configurable privacy and security settings.

===Shell integration===
The player has Windows Explorer shell integration to add files and playlist to the &quot;Now Playing&quot; pane and other playlists can be controlled from the Windows Explorer shell itself, via right-click menu. The My Music folder also includes a separate &quot;My Playlists&quot; folder where playlists are maintained. When the player is closed and reopened, simply clicking the play button restores the last playlist even if it was not saved. Starting with Windows Media Player 10, the playlist pane is also visible from the Library view. AutoPlay handlers in Windows expose various Windows Media Player tasks.

Up to version 11, it featured a taskbar-mounted &quot;Mini-mode&quot; in which the most common media control buttons are presented as a toolbar on the Windows taskbar. Flyout windows can display media information, the active visualization or the video being played back. Mini-mode was introduced as a shell player powertoy for Windows Media Player 8 in Windows XP and integrated later into WMP 9 Series. Mini-mode has been removed in Windows Media Player 12 in favor of controls in the taskbar&#x27;s interactive thumbnail preview which lacks volume control, a progress bar and information displayed whenever a new song is played. Despite this, however, Mini-mode can be restored in Windows Media Player 12 by registering the wmpband.dll file from Windows Media Player 11.

The user interface has been redesigned in Windows Media Player 12 such that the &quot;Now Playing&quot; view plays media in a separate minimalist window with floating playback controls, and also gives access to the current playlist, visualizations, and enhancements. Enhancements are housed in individual undocked windows. The library view includes the rest of the media management functions. It also can preview songs from the library when users hover over the media file and click the Preview button. Windows Media Player 12 can play unprotected songs from the iTunes library. As previously mentioned, taskbar-integrated mini-mode has been replaced with controls in the taskbar&#x27;s interactive thumbnail preview (called the &quot;Thumbnail Toolbar&quot;), albeit minus the volume control function, track and album information shown whenever a new song is played and the progress bar. The taskbar icon also supports jump lists introduced in Windows 7.

===Extensibility===
The player has had skinning support since Windows Media Player (WMP) 7 and includes a color chooser since the WMP 9 Series. Not all functions are usually exposed in skin mode. Windows Media Player 10 allows setting the video border color. Color chooser has been removed in WMP 12. It supports visualizations and &quot;Info Center View&quot; (Info Center View in WMP 9 Series and later) which displays media metadata fetched from the internet. Full screen visualizations are supported in WMP 9 Series and later. It supports Background plug-ins, window plug-ins and &quot;Now Playing&quot; plug-ins to control media playback besides DSP and renderer plug-ins. Plug-in support was introduced in WMP 9 Series.

===Online features===
The player integrates web-browsing support to browse online music stores, shop for music and tune to internet radio stations since version 7. It provides an embeddable ActiveX control for Internet Explorer so that developers can play Windows Media on web pages. Windows Media Player 10 and later feature integration with a large number of online music stores and selecting a music store switches the Info Center view, radio and other online features to use services from that store. Purchased music from a particular store appears in a separate library node under the respective category.

===Media streaming===

Previously, Microsoft had released Windows Media Connect for Windows XP to stream media content with its built-in UPnP media server. With version 11 of Windows Media Player, Media Sharing was integrated and allows content (Music, Pictures, Video) to be streamed to and from Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) AV enabled devices such as the PS3, Xbox 360, and Roku SoundBridge. This includes DRM protected PlaysForSure content. WMP 11 on Windows Vista can also act as a client to connect to remote media libraries using this feature; this is not available on the Windows XP version.

With version 12, media streaming was further improved. While previous versions streamed media to UPnP compliant devices (Digital Media Server role) and could play media by fetching it from a network share (Digital Media Player role), Windows Media Player 12 can access media from the shared media libraries on the network or HomeGroup, stream media to DLNA 1.5 compliant devices and allows itself (once the remote control option is turned on) to be remotely controlled by Digital Media Controller devices which stream media (Digital Media Renderer role). Similarly, the &quot;Play To&quot; feature once enabled for remote PCs, by turning on remote control of the player, allows compliant devices and computers to be discovered and controlled remotely from a computer running Windows Media Player 12 (Digital Media Controller role). If the devices do not support the streamed format, Windows Media Player 12 transcodes the format on-the-fly. Media from a home network can also be streamed over the internet using an &quot;Online ID Provider&quot; service, which handles discovery of the computer&#x27;s IP address, authorization, security, connectivity and Quality of Service issues.

===Skin Mode===
Windows Media Player also features skins. Currently, Windows Media Player has two default skins: &quot;Corporate,” which was first introduced in version 8, and &quot;Revert,” which first shipped with version 9. In previous versions of Windows Media Player starting with version 7, there were many usual skins offered, some of which were included in various versions of Windows. A non-exhaustive list of skins included with Windows Media Player from versions 7-10 are &quot;9SeriesDefault,” &quot;Atomic,” &quot;Bluesky,” &quot;Canvas,” &quot;Classic,” &quot;Compact,” &quot;goo,” &quot;Headspace,” &quot;heart,” &quot;iconic,” &quot;Miniplayer,” &quot;Optic,” &quot;Pyrite,” &quot;QuickSilver,” &quot;Radio,” &quot;Roundlet,” &quot;Rusty,” &quot;splat,” &quot;Toothy,” &quot;Windows Classic,” and &quot;Windows XP.” All of these skins were removed starting with version 11, but are retained if the player is upgraded. Some skins such as the ones included in previous versions can be downloaded from the Microsoft website, however they have since been removed. It has been archived since 2016 and is currently available. The Corporate skin is not deletable.

==Security issues==
Microsoft Windows Media Runtime in Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows Server contained a bug that permitted &quot;remote code execution if a user opened a specially crafted media file&quot;. Such a file would allow the attacker to &quot;then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights&quot;, if the account on which the file was played had administrator privileges. The problem was addressed in a critical update issued on September 8, 2009.

==Other versions==
Microsoft has also released versions of Windows Media Player for other platforms including Windows Mobile, classic Mac OS, Mac OS X, Palm-size PC, Handheld PC, and Solaris. These versions are no longer supported by Microsoft. Version 1 of the Zune software was also based on Windows Media Player; later versions are not.

===Windows Mobile===

Windows Media Player for Pocket PC was first announced on January 6, 2000, and has been revised on a schedule roughly similar to that of the Windows version. Currently known as &quot;Media Player 10 Mobile,” this edition (released in October 2004) closely resembles the capabilities of the Windows version of WMP 10, including playlist capabilities, a media library, album art, WMA Lossless playback, support for DRM-protected media, video playback at 640×480 with stereo sound, and the same Energy Blue interface aesthetics also seen in Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005. It also supports synchronization with the desktop version of WMP 10, and additionally supports synchronizing and transcoding of recorded television shows from Media Center. Media Player 10 Mobile is not available as a download from Microsoft, distribution is done solely through OEM partners, and is typically included on devices based on Windows Mobile.

Windows Mobile 6 includes a copy of Windows Media Player 10 Mobile, but with a similar (but not quite identical) theme as Windows Media Player 11.

===Mac OS X===
Version 9 was the final version of Windows Media Player to be released for Mac OS X before development was canceled by Microsoft. It was developed by the Windows Media team at Microsoft instead of the Macintosh Business Unit and released in 2003. On release the application lacked many basic features that were found in other media players such as Apple&#x27;s iTunes and QuickTime. It also lacked support for many media formats that version 9 of the Windows counterpart supported on release 10 months earlier.

The Mac version supported only Windows Media encoded media (up to version 9) enclosed in the ASF format, lacking support for all other formats such as MP4, MPEG, and Microsoft&#x27;s own AVI format. On the user interface front, it did not prevent screensavers from running during playback, it did not support file drag-and-drop, nor did it support playlists. While Windows Media Player 9 had added support for some files that use the WMV9 codec (also known as the WMV3 codec by the FourCC), in other aspects it was seen as having degraded in features from previous versions.

On January 12, 2006, Microsoft announced it had ceased development of Windows Media Player for Mac. Microsoft now distributes a third-party plugin called WMV Player (produced and maintained by Flip4Mac) which allows some forms of Windows Media to be played within Apple&#x27;s QuickTime Player and other QuickTime-aware applications.

==European Commission case==
In March 2004, the European Commission in the European Union Microsoft antitrust case fined Microsoft €497 million and ordered the company to provide a version of Windows without Windows Media Player, claiming Microsoft &quot;broke European Union competition law by leveraging its near monopoly in the market for PC operating systems onto the markets for work group server operating systems and for media players.” The company has made available a compliant version of its flagship operating system under the negotiated name &quot;Windows XP N,” though the product has not been very successful. Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 are also available in &quot;N&quot; editions. However, it is possible to either install Windows Media Player (XP/Vista) or the Media Restore Pack through Windows Update (Vista) to add the media player.

==Release history==
Prior to the release of Windows Media Player in Windows 98 Second Edition, separate programs, CD Player, Deluxe CD Player, DVD Player and Media Player, were included in old versions of Microsoft Windows for playback of media files. Only Windows Media Player 11 is not available for Windows Server 2003.

<text>A Petri dish (alternatively known as a Petri plate or cell-culture dish) is a shallow transparent lidded dish that biologists use to hold growth medium in which cells can be cultured, originally, cells of bacteria, fungi and small mosses. The container is named after its inventor, German bacteriologist Julius Richard Petri. It is the most common type of culture plate. The Petri dish is one of the most common items in biology laboratories and has entered popular culture. The term is sometimes written in lower case, especially in non-technical literature.

What was later called Petri dish was originally developed by German physician Robert Koch in his private laboratory in 1881, as a precursor method. Petri, as assistant to Koch, at Berlin University made the final modifications in 1887 as used today.

Penicillin, the first antibiotic, was discovered in 1929 when Alexander Fleming noticed that penicillium mold contaminating a bacterial culture in a Petri dish had killed the bacteria around it.

== History ==

The Petri dish was developed by German physician Julius Richard Petri (after whom the name is given) while working as an assistant to Robert Koch at Berlin University. Petri did not invent the culture dish himself; rather, it was a modified version of Koch&#x27;s invention which used an agar medium that was developed by Walther Hesse. Koch had published a precursor dish in a booklet in 1881 titled &quot;&quot; (&quot;Methods for the Study of Pathogenic Organisms&quot;), which has been known as the &quot;Bible of Bacteriology&quot;. He described a new bacterial culture method that used a glass slide with agar and a container (basically a Petri dish, a circular glass dish of 20 × 5 cm with matching lid) which he called &quot;&quot; (&quot;moist chamber&quot;). A bacterial culture was spread on the glass slide, then placed in the moist chamber with a small wet paper. Bacterial growth was easily visible.

Koch publicly demonstrated his plating method at the Seventh International Medical Congress in London in August 1881. There, Louis Pasteur exclaimed, &quot;&quot; (&quot;What a great progress, Sir!&quot;) It was using this method that Koch discovered important pathogens of tuberculosis (&quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;), anthrax (&quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;), and cholera (&quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;). For his research on tuberculosis, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1905. His students also made important discoveries. Friedrich Loeffler discovered the bacteria of glanders (&quot;Burkholderia mallei&quot;) in 1882 and diphtheria (&quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;) in 1884; and Georg Theodor August Gaffky, the bacterium of typhoid (&quot;Salmonella enterica&quot;) in 1884.

Petri made changes in how the circular dish was used. It is often asserted that Petri developed a new culture plate, but this is incorrect. Instead of using a separate glass slide or plate on which culture media were placed, Petri directly placed media into the glass dish, eliminating unnecessary steps such as transferring the culture media, using the wet paper, and reducing the chance of contamination. He published the improved method in 1887 as &quot;&quot; (&quot;A minor modification of the plating technique of Koch&quot;). Although it could have been named &quot;Koch dish&quot;, the final method was given an eponymous name Petri dish.

== Features and variants ==
Petri dishes are usually cylindrical, mostly with diameters ranging from , and a height to diameter ratio ranging from 1:10 to 1:4. Squarish versions are also available.

Petri dishes were traditionally reusable and made of glass; often of heat-resistant borosilicate glass for proper sterilization at 120–160 °C.

Since the 1960s, plastic dishes, usually disposable, are also common.

The dishes are often covered with a shallow transparent lid, resembling a slightly wider version of the dish itself. The lids of glass dishes are usually loose-fitting. Plastic dishes may have close-fitting covers that delay the drying of the contents. Alternatively, some glass or plastic versions may have small holes around the rim, or ribs on the underside of the cover, to allow for air flow over the culture and prevent water condensation.

Some Petri dishes, especially plastic ones, usually feature rings and/or slots on their lids and bases so that they are less prone to sliding off one another when stacked or sticking to a smooth surface by suction.

Small dishes may have a protruding base that can be secured on a microscope stage for direct examination.

Some versions may have grids printed on the bottom to help in measuring the density of cultures.

A microplate is a single container with an array of flat-bottomed cavities, each being essentially a small Petri dish. It makes it possible to inoculate and grow dozens or hundreds of independent cultures of dozens of samples at the same time. Besides being much cheaper and convenient than separate dishes, the microplate is also more amenable to automated handling and inspection.

Some plates are separated into different mediums known as biplates, triplates, and quadplates.

== Uses ==

Petri dishes are widely used in biology to cultivate microorganisms such as bacteria, yeasts, and molds. It is most suited for organisms that thrive on a solid or semisolid surface. The culture medium is often an agar plate, a layer a few mm thick of agar or agarose gel containing whatever nutrients the organism requires (such as blood, salts, carbohydrates, amino acids) and other desired ingredients (such as dyes, indicators, and medicinal drugs). The agar and other ingredients are dissolved in warm water and poured into the dish and left to cool down. Once the medium solidifies, a sample of the organism is inoculated (&quot;plated&quot;). The dishes are then left undisturbed for hours or days while the organism grows, possibly in an incubator. They are usually covered, or placed upside-down, to lessen the risk of contamination from airborne spores. Virus or phage cultures require that a population of bacteria be grown in the dish first, which then becomes the culture medium for the viral inoculum.

While Petri dishes are widespread in microbiological research, smaller dishes tend to be used for large-scale studies in which growing cells in Petri dishes can be relatively expensive and labor-intensive.

Petri dishes can be used to visualize the location of contamination on surfaces, such as kitchen counters and utensils, clothing, food preparation equipment, or animal and human skin. For this application, the Petri dishes may be filled so that the culture medium protrudes slightly above the edges of the dish to make it easier to take samples on hard objects. Shallow Petri dishes prepared in this way are called Replicate Organism Detection And Counting (RODAC) plates and are available commercially.

Petri dishes are also used for cell cultivation of isolated cells from eukaryotic organisms, such as in immunodiffusion studies, on solid agar or in a liquid medium.

Petri dishes may be used to observe the early stages of plant germination, and to grow plants asexually from isolated cells.

Petri dishes may be convenient enclosures to study the behavior of insects and other small animals.

Due to their large open surface, Petri dishes are effective containers to evaporate solvents and dry out precipitates, either at room temperature or in ovens and desiccators.

Petri dishes also make convenient temporary storage for samples, especially liquid, granular, or powdered ones, and small objects such as insects or seeds. Their transparency and flat profile allows the contents to be inspected with the naked eye, magnifying glass, or low-power microscope without removing the lid.

== In popular culture ==

The Petri dish is one of a small number of laboratory equipment items whose name entered popular culture. It is often used metaphorically, e.g. for a contained community that is being studied as if they were microorganisms in a biology experiment, or an environment where original ideas and enterprises may flourish.&lt;ref name=&quot;merriam-webster.com/dictionary/petridish&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Unicode has a Petri dish emoji, &quot;🧫&quot;, which has the code point U+1F9EB (HTML entity &quot;&amp;#129515;&quot; or &quot;&amp;#x1F9EB;&quot;, UTF-8 &quot;0xF0 0x9F 0xA7 0xAB&quot;).

<text>Massage is the rubbing or kneading of the body&#x27;s soft tissues. Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands, fingers, elbows, knees, forearms, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. In English-speaking European countries, a person professionally trained to give massages is traditionally known as a masseur (male) or masseuse (female). In the United States, these individuals are often referred to as &quot;massage therapists&quot;. In some provinces of Canada, they are called &quot;registered massage therapists.&quot;

In professional settings, clients are treated while lying on a massage table, sitting in a massage chair, or lying on a mat on the floor. There are many different modalities in the massage industry, including (but not limited to): deep tissue, manual lymphatic drainage, medical, sports, structural integration, Swedish, Thai and trigger point.

== Etymology ==
The word comes from the French &#x27;friction of kneading&#x27;, which, in turn, comes either from the Arabic word &quot;massa&quot; meaning &#x27;to touch, feel&#x27;, the Portuguese &#x27;knead&#x27;, from the Latin meaning &#x27;mass, dough&#x27;, or the Greek verb () &#x27;to handle, touch, to work with the hands, to knead dough&#x27;.

The ancient Greek word for massage was and the Latin was .

== History ==
=== Ancient times ===
Archaeological evidence of massage has been found in many ancient civilizations including China, India, Japan, Egypt, Rome, Greece, and Mesopotamia.

2330 BC: The Tomb of Akmanthor (also known as &quot;The Tomb of the Physician&quot;) in Saqqara, Egypt, depicts two men having work done on their feet and hands, possibly depicting a massage.
2000 BC: The word &quot;muššu&#x27;u&quot; (&quot;massage&quot;) is written for the first time, and its use is described, in some Sumerian and Akkadian texts found at the beginning of the 21st century in ancient Mesopotamia.

722–481 BC: &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; is composed during the Chinese Spring and Autumn period. The Nei-jing is a compilation of medical knowledge known up to that date, and is the foundation of traditional Chinese medicine. Massage is referred to in 30 different chapters of the Nei Jing. It specifies the use of different massage techniques and how they should be used in the treatment of specific ailments, and injuries. Also known as &quot;The Yellow Emperor&#x27;s Inner Canon,&quot; the text refers to previous medical knowledge from the time of the Yellow Emperor (), misleading some into believing the text itself was written during the time of the Yellow Emperor (which would predate written history).

762 BC: In the Iliad and the Odyssey, massage with oils and aromatic substances is mentioned as a means to relax the tired limbs of warriors and as a way to help the treatment of wounds.

700 BC: Bian Que, the earliest known Chinese physician, uses massage in medical practice.

500 BC: Jīvaka Komarabhācca was an Indian physician who according to the Pāli Buddhist Canon was Shakyamuni Buddha&#x27;s physician. Jivaka is sometimes credited with founding and developing a style of massage that led to the type of massage practiced in current-day Thailand. Though this claim is disputed.

493 BC: A possible biblical reference documents daily &quot;treatments&quot; with oil of myrrh as a part of the beauty regimen of the wives of Xerxes (Esther, 2:12).

460 BC: Hippocrates wrote &quot;The physician must be experienced in many things, but assuredly in rubbing.&quot;

300 BC: Charaka Samhita, sometimes dated to 800 BCE, is one of the oldest of the three ancient treatises of Ayurvedic medicine, including massage. Sanskrit records indicate that massage had been practiced in India long before the beginning of recorded history.

AD 1st or 2nd: Galen mentioned Diogas (Διόγας) who was an &quot;iatralipta&quot; (ἰατραλείπτης) (rubber and anointer/physiotherapist).

AD 581: China establishes a department of massage therapy within the Office of Imperial Physicians.

=== Middle Ages ===
Many of Galen&#x27;s manuscripts, for instance, were collected and translated by Hunayn ibn Ishaq in the 9th century. Later in the 11th-century copies were translated into Latin and again in the 15th and 16th centuries, when they helped enlighten European scholars as to the achievements of the Ancient Greeks. This renewal of the Galenic tradition during the Renaissance played a very important part in the rise of modern science.

One of the greatest Persian medics was Avicenna, also known as Ibn Sina, who lived from 980 AD to 1037 AD. His works included a comprehensive collection and systematization of the fragmentary and unorganized Greco-Roman medical literature that had been translated Arabic by that time, augmented by notes from his own experiences. One of his books, &quot;Al-Qānūn fī aṭ-Ṭibb&quot; (The Canon of Medicine) has been called the most famous single book in the history of medicine in both East and West. Avicenna excelled in the logical assessment of conditions and comparison of symptoms and took special note of analgesics and their proper use as well as other methods of relieving pain, including massage.

AD 1150: Evidence of massage abortion, involving the application of pressure to the pregnant abdomen, can be found in one of the bas reliefs decorating the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia. It depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the underworld. This is the oldest known visual representation of abortion.

In Southeast Asia, massage traditions and techniques have already been entrenched in the people&#x27;s diverse cultures for centuries before trade contact with Europe in the 16th century. In the Philippines, a distinct massage and healing tradition called hilot developed, while in Thailand, the tradition of massage that developed was called nuad thai. Nuad thai was declared in 2019 as a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
AD 1776: Jean Joseph Marie Amiot and Pierre-Martial Cibot, French missionaries in China translate summaries of Huangdi Neijing, including a list of medical plants, exercises, and elaborate massage techniques, into the French language, thereby introducing Europe to the highly developed Chinese system of medicine, medical-gymnastics, and medical-massage.

AD 1776: Pehr Henrik Ling, a Swedish physical therapist and teacher of medical-gymnastics, is born. Ling has often been erroneously credited for having invented &quot;Classic Massage&quot;, also known as &quot;Swedish Massage&quot;, and has been called the &quot;Father of Massage&quot;.

AD 1779: Frenchman Pierre-Martial Cibot publishes &quot;Notice du Cong-fou des Bonzes Tao-see&quot;, also known as &quot;The Cong-Fou of the Tao-Tse&quot;, a French language summary of medical techniques used by Taoist priests. According to English historian of China Joseph Needham, Cibot&#x27;s work &quot;was intended to present the physicists and physicians of Europe with a sketch of a system of medical gymnastics which they might like to adopt—or if they found it at fault they might be stimulated to invent something better. This work has long been regarded as of cardinal importance in the history of physiotherapy because it almost certainly influenced the Swedish founder of the modern phase of the art, Pehr Hendrik Ling. Cibot had studied at least one Chinese book but also got much from a Christian neophyte who had become expert in the subject before his conversion.&quot;

AD 1813: The Royal Gymnastic Central Institute for the training of gymnastic instructors was opened in Stockholm, Sweden, with Pehr Henrik Ling appointed as principal. Ling developed what he called the &quot;Swedish Movement Cure&quot;. Ling died in 1839, having previously named his pupils as the repositories of his teaching. Ling and his assistants left a little proper written account of their methods.

AD 1868: Dutch massage practitioner Johan Georg Mezger applies French terms to name five basic massage techniques, and coins the phrase &quot;Swedish massage system&quot;. These techniques are still known by their French names (effleurage (long, gliding strokes), petrissage (lifting and kneading the muscles), friction (firm, deep, circular rubbing movements), tapotement (brisk tapping or percussive movements) and vibration (rapidly shaking or vibrating specific muscles)).

=== Modern times ===

==== China ====

As of 2005, with the city of Shanghai alone there were an estimated 1,300–2,000 foot massage centers, with more than 3,000 in Shenzhen. It was also estimated that there were nearly 30,000 massage workers in Shanghai and over 40,000 in Shenzhen. The average rate of pay for a worker in the massage industry in China is over 10,000 yuan per month, making them a well-paying job in China&#x27;s service sector.

Massage started to become popular in the United States in the middle part of the 19th century and was introduced by two New York physicians, George and Charles Taylor, based on Pehr Henrik Ling&#x27;s techniques developed in Sweden.

During the 1930s and 1940s, massage&#x27;s influence decreased as a result of medical advancements of the time, while in the 1970s massage&#x27;s influence grew once again with a notable rise among athletes. Until the 1970s, nurses used massage to reduce pain and aid sleep. Popular books and videos, such as Massage for Relaxation, helped introduce massage to popular culture outside of a health setting. The massage therapy industry is continuously increasing. In 2009, U.S. consumers spent between $4 and $6 billion on visits to massage therapists. In 2015, research estimates that massage therapy was a $12.1 billion industry.

All but five states require massage therapists to be licensed, and licensure requires the applicant to receive training at an accredited school, and to pass a comprehensive exam. Those states that require licensure also typically require continuing education in massage techniques and in ethics.

==== United Kingdom ====
The service of massage or &quot;physiological shampooing&quot; was advertised in &quot;The Times&quot; from as early as 1880. Adverts claimed it as a cure for obesity amongst other chronic ailments.

==== Sports, business and organizations ====

Massage developed alongside athletics in both Ancient China and Ancient Greece. Taoist priests developed massage in concert with their Kung Fu gymnastic movements, while Ancient Greek Olympians used a specific type of trainer (&quot;aleiptes&quot;) who would rub their muscles with oil. Pehr Ling&#x27;s introduction to massage also came about directly as a result of his study of gymnastic movements.

The 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles was the first time that massage therapy was televised as it was being performed on the athletes. And then, during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta massage therapy was finally offered as a core medical service to the US Olympic Team. Massage has been employed by businesses and organizations such as the U.S. Department of Justice, Boeing and Reebok. Athletes such as Michael Jordan and LeBron James have personal massage therapists that at times even travel with them.

== Types and methods ==
=== Acupressure ===

Acupressure [from Latin acus &quot;needle&quot; (see acuity) + pressure (n.)] is a technique similar in principle to acupuncture. It is based on the concept of life energy which flows through &quot;meridians&quot; in the body. In treatment, physical pressure is applied to acupuncture points with the aim of clearing blockages in those meridians. Pressure may be applied by fingers, palm, elbow, toes or with various devices.

Some medical studies have suggested that acupressure may be effective at helping manage nausea and vomiting, for helping lower back pain, tension headaches, stomach ache, among other things, although such studies have been found to have a high likelihood of bias.

=== Ashiatsu ===

In ashiatsu, the practitioner uses their feet to deliver treatment. The name comes from the Japanese, &quot;ashi&quot; for foot and &quot;atsu&quot; for pressure. This technique typically uses the heel, sesamoid, arch, and/or whole plantar surface of foot, and offers large compression, tension and shear forces with less pressure than an elbow and is ideal for large muscles, such as in thigh, or for long-duration upper trapezius compressions. Other manual therapy techniques using the feet to provide treatment include Keralite, Barefoot Lomilomi, and Chavutti Thirumal.

=== Ayurvedic massage ===
Ayurvedic massage is known as &quot;Abhyangam&quot; in Sanskrit. According to the Ayurvedic Classics &quot;Abhyangam&quot; is an important dincharya (Daily Regimen) that is needed for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The massage technique used during Ayurvedic Massage aims to stimulate the lymphatic system. Practitioners claim that the benefits of regular Ayurvedic massage include pain relief, reduction of fatigue, improved immune system and improved longevity.

=== Burmese massage ===
&quot;Known in Myanmar as Yoe Yar Nhake Nal Chin, meaning &#x27;traditional massage&#x27;, Burmese massage has its ancient origins from Thai, Chinese and Indian medicine. Currently, Burmese massage also includes the use of local natural ingredients such as Thanaka which helps to promote smooth skin and prevents sunburn.&quot;

Burmese massage is a full body massage technique that starts from head to toes, drawing on acupuncture, reflexology and kneading. Signature massage strokes include acupressure using the elbows, quick gentle knocking of acupressure points, and slow kneading of tight muscles. The massage aims to improve blood circulation and quality of sleep, while at the same time help to promote better skin quality.

=== Biomechanical stimulation (BMS) massage ===

Biomechanical stimulation (BMS) is a term generally used for localised biomechanical oscillation methods, whereby local muscle groups are stimulated directly or via the associated tendons by means of special hand held mechanical vibration devices. Biomechanical oscillation therapy and training is offered in a variety of areas such as competitive sports, fitness, rehabilitation, medicine, prevention, beauty and used to improve performance of the muscles and to improve coordination and balance. It is often used in myofascial trigger point therapy to invoke reciprocal inhibition within the musculoskeletal system. Beneficial effects from this type of stimulation have been found to exist.

=== Biodynamic massage ===

Biodynamic massage was created by Gerda Boyesen as part of Biodynamic Psychotherapy. It uses a combination of hands-on work and &quot;energy work&quot; and also uses a stethoscope to hear the peristalsis.

=== Craniosacral therapy ===

Craniosacral therapy (CST) is a pseudoscience that aims to improve fluid movement and cranial bone motion by applying light touch to the skull, face, spine, and pelvis.

=== Erotic massage ===

A type of massage that is done in an erotic way via the use of massage techniques by a person on another person&#x27;s erogenous zones to achieve or enhance their sexual excitation or arousal and to achieve orgasm.

It was also once used for medical purposes as well as for the treatment of &quot;female hysteria&quot; and &quot;womb disease&quot;.

Nuru massage is a Japanese form of erotic massage.

=== Hammam (&quot;Turkish bath&quot;) massage ===

In the traditional Hammam, massage involves not just vigorous muscle kneading, but also joint cracking, &quot;not so much a tender working of the flesh as a pummeling, a cracking of joints, a twisting of limbs...&quot; An 18th-century traveler reported:
=== Lomilomi and indigenous massage of Oceania ===

&quot;Lomilomi&quot; is the traditional massage of Hawaii. As an indigenous practice, it varies by island and by family. The word &quot;lomilomi&quot; also is used for massage in Samoa and East Futuna. In Samoa, it is also known as &quot;lolomi&quot; and &quot;milimili&quot;. In East Futuna, it is also called &quot;milimili&quot;, &quot;fakasolosolo&quot;, &quot;amoamo&quot;, &quot;lusilusi&quot;, &quot;kinikini&quot;, &quot;fai’ua&quot;. The Māori call it &quot;romiromi&quot; and &quot;mirimiri&quot;. In Tonga massage is &quot;fotofota&quot;, &quot;tolotolo&quot;, and &quot;amoamo&quot;. In Tahiti it is &quot;rumirumi&quot;. On Nanumea in Tuvalu, massage is known as &quot;popo&quot;, pressure application is &quot;kukumi&quot;, and heat application is &quot;tutu&quot;. Massage has also been documented in Tikopia in the Solomon Islands, in Rarotonga, in Pukapuka and in Western Samoa.

=== Lymphatic drainage ===

Manual lymphatic drainage is a technique used to gently work and stimulate the lymphatic system, to assist in reduction of localized swelling. The lymphatic system is a network of slow moving vessels in the body that carries cellular waste toward the liver, to be filtered and removed. Lymph also carries lymphocytes and other immune system agents. Manual lymphatic drainage claims to improve waste removal and immune function.

=== Medical massage ===
Medical massage is a controversial term in the massage profession. Many use it to describe a specific technique. Others use it to describe a general category of massage and many methods such as deep tissue massage, myofascial release and trigger-point therapy, as well as osteopathic techniques, cranial-sacral techniques and many more can be used to work with various medical conditions.

Massage used in the medical field includes decongestive therapy used for lymphedema which can be used in conjunction with the treatment of breast cancer. Light massage is also used in pain management and palliative care. Carotid sinus massage is used to diagnose carotid sinus syncope and is sometimes useful for differentiating supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) from ventricular tachycardia. It, like the valsalva maneuver, is a therapy for SVT. However, it is less effective than management of SVT with medications.

A 2004 systematic review found single applications of massage therapy &quot;reduced state anxiety, blood pressure, and heart rate but not negative mood, immediate assessment of pain, and cortisol level,&quot; while &quot;multiple applications reduced delayed assessment of pain,&quot; and found improvements in anxiety and depression similar to effects of psychotherapy. A subsequent systematic review published in 2008 found that there is little evidence supporting the use of massage therapy for depression in high quality studies from randomized controlled trials.

=== Myofascial release ===

Myofascial release refers to the manual massage technique that claims to release adhered fascia and muscles with the goal of eliminating pain, increasing range of motion and equilibrioception. Myofascial release usually involves applying shear compression or tension in various directions, cross fiber friction or by skin rolling.

=== Reflexology ===
Reflexology, also known as &quot;zone therapy&quot;, is an alternative medicine involving application of pressure to the feet and hands with specific thumb, finger, and hand techniques without the use of oil or lotion. It is based on a pseudoscientific belief in a system of zones and reflex areas that purportedly reflect an image of the body on the feet and hands, with the premise that such work effects a physical change to the body.

=== Shiatsu ===
Shiatsu (指圧) (&quot;shi&quot; meaning finger and &quot;atsu&quot; meaning pressure) is a form of Japanese bodywork based on concepts in traditional Chinese medicine such as qi meridians. It consists of finger, palm pressure, stretches, and other massage techniques. There is no convincing data available to suggest that shiatsu is an effective treatment for any medical condition.

=== Sports massage ===

Sports massage is the use of specific massage therapy techniques in an athletic context to improve recovery time, enhance performance and reduce the risk of injury. This is accomplished using techniques that stimulate the flow of blood and lymph to and from muscles. Sports massage is often delivered before or after physical activity depending on the subject&#x27;s needs, preferences and goals. Sports massages may help with flexibility, pain and recovery but the scientific evidence is mixed.

=== Structural Integration ===

Structural Integration&#x27;s aim is to unwind the strain patterns in the body&#x27;s myofascial system, restoring it to its natural balance, alignment, length and ease. This is accomplished by hands-on manipulation, coupled with movement re-education. There are about 15 schools of Structural Integration as recognized by the International Association of Structural Integration, including the Dr. Ida Rolf Institute (with the brand Rolfing), Hellerwork, Guild for Structural Integration, Aston Patterning, Soma, and Kinesis Myofascial Integration.

=== Swedish massage ===

The most widely recognized and commonly used category of massage is Swedish massage. The Swedish massage techniques vary from light to vigorous. Swedish massage uses five styles of strokes. The five basic strokes are effleurage (sliding or gliding), petrissage (kneading), tapotement (rhythmic tapping), friction (cross fiber or with the fibers) and vibration/shaking.

The development of Swedish massage is often inaccurately credited to Per Henrik Ling, though the Dutch practitioner Johann Georg Mezger applied the French terms to name the basic strokes. The term &quot;Swedish massage&quot; is actually only recognized in English- and Dutch-speaking countries, and in Hungary and Israel. Elsewhere the style is referred to as &quot;classic massage&quot;.

Clinical studies have found that Swedish massage can reduce chronic pain, fatigue, joint stiffness and improve function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.

=== Thai massage ===
Known in Thailand as &quot;Nuat phaen boran&quot;, meaning &quot;ancient/traditional massage&quot;, traditional Thai massage is generally based on a combination of Indian and Chinese traditions of medicine.

Thai massage combines both physical and energetic aspects. It is a deep, full-body massage progressing from the feet up, and focusing on sen or energy lines throughout the body, with the aim of clearing blockages in these lines, and thus stimulating the flow of blood and lymph throughout the body. It draws on yoga, acupressure and reflexology.

Thai massage is a popular massage therapy that is used for the management of conditions such as musculoskeletal pain and fatigue. Thai massage involves a number of stretching movements that improve body flexibility, joint movement and also improve blood circulation throughout the body. In one study scientists found that Thai massage showed comparable efficacy as the painkiller ibuprofen in the reduction of joint pain caused by osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

=== Traditional Chinese massage ===

Massage of Chinese Medicine is known as &quot;An Mo&quot; (按摩) (pressing and rubbing) or Qigong Massage and is the foundation of Japan&#x27;s Anma. Categories include &quot;Pu Tong An Mo&quot; (普通按摩) (general massage), &quot;Tui Na An Mo&quot; (推拿按摩) (pushing and grasping massage), Dian Xue An Mo (cavity pressing massage), and &quot;Qi An Mo&quot; (氣按摩 ) (energy massage). Tui na (推拿) focuses on pushing, stretching, and kneading muscles, and &quot;Zhi Ya&quot;(指壓) focuses on pinching and pressing at acupressure points. Technique such as friction and vibration are used as well.

=== Trigger point therapy ===
Sometimes confused with pressure point massage, this involves deactivating trigger points that may cause local pain or refer pain and other sensations, such as headaches, in other parts of the body. Manual pressure, vibration, injection, or other treatment is applied to these points to relieve myofascial pain. Trigger points were first discovered and mapped by Janet G. Travell (President Kennedy&#x27;s physician) and David Simons. Trigger points have been photomicrographed and measured electrically and in 2007 a paper was presented showing images of Trigger Points using MRI. These points relate to dysfunction in the myoneural junction, also called neuromuscular junction (NMJ), in muscle, and therefore this technique is different from reflexology acupressure and pressure point massage.

=== Tui na ===

Tui na is a Chinese manual therapy technique that includes many different types of strokes, aimed to improve the flow of chi through the meridians.

=== Watsu ===

Watsu, developed by Harold Dull at Harbin Hot Springs, California, is a type of aquatic bodywork performed in near-body-temperature water, and characterized by continuous support by the practitioner and gentle movement, including rocking, stretching of limbs, and massage. The technique combines hydrotherapy floating and immersion with shiatsu and other massage techniques. Watsu is used as a form of aquatic therapy for deep relaxation and other therapeutic intent. Related forms include Waterdance, Healing Dance, and Jahara technique.

== Facilities, equipment, and supplies ==
=== Massage tables and chairs ===
Specialized massage tables and chairs are used to position recipients during massages. A typical commercial massage table has an easily cleaned, heavily padded surface, and horseshoe-shaped head support that allows the client to breathe easily while lying face down and can be stationary or portable, while home versions are often lighter weight or designed to fold away easily. An orthopedic pillow or bolster can be used to correct body positioning.

Ergonomic chairs serve a similar function as a massage table. Chairs may be either stationary or portable models. Massage chairs are easier to transport than massage tables, and recipients do not need to disrobe to receive a chair massage. Due to these two factors, chair massage is often performed in settings such as corporate offices, outdoor festivals, shopping malls, and other public locations.

=== Warm-water therapy pools ===
Temperature-controlled warm-water therapy pools are used to perform aquatic bodywork. For example, Watsu requires a warm-water therapy pool that is approximately chest-deep (depending on the height of the therapist) and temperature-controlled to about 35 °C (95 °F).

=== Dry-water massage tables ===

A dry-water massage table uses jets of water to perform the massage of the patient&#x27;s muscles. These tables differ from a Vichy shower in that the client usually stays dry. Two common types are one in which the client lies on a waterbed-like mattress which contains warm water and jets of water and air bubbles and one in which the client lies on a foam pad and is covered by a plastic sheet and is then sprayed by jets of warm water, similar to a Vichy shower. The first type is sometimes seen available for use in shopping centers for a small fee.

=== Vichy showers ===
A Vichy shower is a form of hydrotherapy that uses a series of shower nozzles that spray large quantities of water over the client while they lie in a shallow wet bed, similar to a massage table, but with drainage for the water. The nozzles may usually be adjusted for height, direction, and temperature to suit the patient&#x27;s needs.

=== Cremes, lotions, gels, and oils ===

Many different types of massage cremes, lotions, gels, and oils are used to lubricate and moisturize the skin and reduce the friction between skin (hands of technician and client).

=== Massage tools ===
These instruments or devices are sometimes used during massages. Some tools are for use by individuals, others by the therapist.

==== Tools used by massage therapists ====
Instrument-assisted soft-tissue massage can deploy stainless-steel devices to manipulate tissue in a way that augments hands-on work.

A body rock is a serpentine-shaped tool, usually carved out of stone. It is used to amplify the therapist&#x27; strength and focus pressure on certain areas. It can be used directly on the skin with a lubricant such as oil or corn starch or directly over clothing.

Bamboo and rosewood tools are also commonly used. They originate from practices in southeast Asia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma. Some of them may be heated, oiled, or wrapped in cloth.

Cupping massage is often carried out using plastic cups and a manual hand-pump to create the vacuum. The vacuum draws the soft tissue perpendicular to the skin, providing a tensile force, which can be left in one site or moved along the tissue during the massage.

==== Tools used by both individuals and massagers ====
Hand-held battery-operated massaging and vibrating instruments are available, including devices for massaging the scalp following a haircut.

Vibrating massage pads come in a range of sizes, some with the option of heating.

Vibrating massage chairs can provide an alternative for therapy at home.

There is a widespread market in erotic massage instruments, including electric dildos and vibrators such as the massage wand.

== Medical and therapeutic use ==
The main professionals that provide therapeutic massage are massage therapists, athletic trainers, physical therapists, and practitioners of many traditional Chinese and other eastern medicines. Massage practitioners work in a variety of medical settings and may travel to private residences or businesses. Contraindications to massage include deep vein thrombosis, bleeding disorders, taking blood thinners such as warfarin, damaged blood vessels, or weakened bones from cancer, osteoporosis, fractures, and fever.

=== Beneficial effects ===
Peer-reviewed medical research has shown that the benefits of massage include pain relief, reduced trait anxiety and depression, temporarily reduced blood pressure, heart rate, and state of anxiety. Additional testing has shown an immediate increase in, and expedited recovery periods for, muscle performance. Theories behind what massage might do include: enhanced skeletal muscle regrowth and remodeling, blocking nociception (gate control theory), activating the parasympathetic nervous system (which may stimulate the release of endorphins and serotonin, preventing fibrosis or scar tissue), increasing the flow of lymph, and improving sleep.

Infant massage has been found to hold therapeutic benefits for premature infants and their parents. Premature infants are susceptible to low birth weight and decreased immune function; massage has been found to counter these effects, causing weight increase, reduced pain, and increased immune function. Administering infant massage also reduces stress and increased oxytocin in parental figures regardless of gender, and overall improves emotional attachment with their child.

Massage research is hindered from reaching the gold standard of scientific inquiry, which includes placebo-controlled and double blind clinical trials. Developing a &quot;sham&quot; manual therapy for massage would be difficult since even light touch massage could have effects on a subject. It would also be difficult to find a subject that would not notice that they were getting less of a massage, and it would be impossible to blind the therapist. Massage research can employ randomized controlled trials, which are published in peer reviewed medical journals. This type of study could increase the credibility of the profession because it displays that purported therapeutic effects are reproducible.

==== Single-dose effects ====

* Pain relief: Relief from pain due to musculoskeletal injuries and other causes is cited as a major benefit of massage. A 2015 Cochrane Review concluded that there is very little evidence that massage is an effective treatment for lower back pain. A meta-analysis conducted by scientists at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign failed to find a statistically significant reduction in pain immediately following treatment. Weak evidence suggests that massage may improve pain in the short term for people with acute, sub-acute, and chronic lower back pain.
* State anxiety: Massage has been shown to reduce state anxiety, a transient measure of anxiety in a given situation.
* Blood pressure and heart rate: Massage has been shown to temporarily reduce blood pressure and heart rate.

==== Multiple-dose effects ====
* Pain relief: Massage may reduce pain experienced in the days or weeks after treatment.
* Trait anxiety: Massage has been shown to reduce trait anxiety; a person&#x27;s general susceptibility to anxiety.
* Depression: Massage has been shown to reduce sub-clinical depression.

==== Neuromuscular effects ====
Massage has been shown to reduce neuromuscular excitability by measuring changes in the Hoffman&#x27;s reflex (H-reflex) amplitude. A decrease in peak-to-peak H-reflex amplitude suggests a decrease in motoneuron excitability. Others explain, &quot;H-reflex is considered to be the electrical analogue of the stretch reflex... and the reduction&quot; is due to a decrease in spinal reflex excitability. Field (2007) confirms that the inhibitory effects are due to deep tissue receptors and not superficial cutaneous receptors, as there was no decrease in H-reflex when looking at light fingertip pressure massage. It has been noted that &quot;the receptors activated during massage are specific to the muscle being massaged,&quot; as other muscles did not produce a decrease in H-reflex amplitude.

== Global regulation and practice ==
Because the art and science of massage is a globally diverse phenomenon, different legal jurisdictions sometimes recognize and license individuals with titles, while other areas do not. Examples are:
* Registered Massage Therapist (RMT) in Canada and New Zealand
* Certified Massage Therapist (CMT) in New Zealand
* Licensed Massage Practitioner (LMP)
* Licensed Massage Therapist (LMT)
* Licensed Massage and Bodywork Therapist (LMBT) in North Carolina
* Therapeutic Massage Therapist (TMT) in South Africa

In some jurisdictions, practicing without a license is a crime. One such jurisdiction is Washington state, where any health professionals practicing without a license can be issued a fine and charged with a misdemeanor offense.

=== Canada ===

In regulated provinces massage therapists are known as Registered Massage Therapists, in Canada six provinces regulate massage therapy: British Columbia, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, and New Brunswick. Registered Massage Therapy in British Columbia is regulated by the College of Massage Therapists of British Columbia (CMTBC). Regulated provinces have, since 2012, established inter-jurisdiction competency standards. Quebec is not provincially regulated. Massage therapists may obtain a certification with one of the various associations operating. There is the Professional Association of Specialized Massage Therapists of Quebec, also named Mon Réseau Plus, which represents 6,300 massage therapists (including ortho therapist, natural therapists, and others), the Quebec Federation of massage therapists (FMQ), and the Association québécoise des thérapeutes naturals; however, none of these are regulated by provincial law.

Canadian educational institutions undergo a formal accreditation process through the Canadian Massage Therapy Council for Accreditation (CMTCA).

=== China ===
Most types of massage, with the exception of some traditional Chinese medicine, are not regulated in China. Although illegal in China, some of the smaller massage parlors are sometimes linked to the sex industry and the government has taken a number of measures in recent times to curb this. In a nationwide crackdown known as the yellow sweep (&quot;Yellow&quot; in Mandarin Chinese refers to sexual activities or pornographic content), limitations on the design and operation of massage parlors have been placed, going so far as requiring identification from customers who visit massage establishments late at night and logging their visits with the local police.

=== France ===
France requires three years of study and two final exams in order to apply for a license.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, massage is regulated by the government on a federal and national level. Only someone who has completed 3,200 hours of training (theoretical and practical) can use the professional title &quot;Masseur und Medizinischer Bademeister&quot; &#x27;Masseur and Medical Spa Therapist&#x27;. This person can prolong his training depending on the length of professional experience to a Physiotherapist (1 year to 18 months additional training). The Masseur is trained in Classical Massage, Myofascial Massage, Exercise, and Movement Therapy. During the training, they will study anatomy, physiology, pathology, gynecology, podiatry, psychiatry, psychology, surgery, dermiatry, and orthopedics. They are trained in Electrotherapy and Hydrotherapy. Hydrotherapy includes Kneipp, Wraps, underwater massage, therapeutic washing, Sauna, and Steambath. A small part of their training will include special forms of massage which are decided by the local college, for example, foot reflex zone massage, Thai Massage, etc. Finally, a graduate is allowed to treat patients under the direction of a doctor. Graduates are regulated by the professional body which regulates Physiotherapists. This includes restrictions on advertising and the oath of confidentiality to clients.

=== India ===
In India, massage therapy is licensed by The Department of Ayurveda, Yoga &amp; Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India) in March 1995. Massage therapy is based on Ayurveda, the ancient medicinal system that evolved around 600 BC. In ayurveda, massage is part of a set of holistic medicinal practices, contrary to the independent massage system popular in some other systems. In Siddha, Tamil traditional medicine from south India, massage is termed as &quot;Thokkanam&quot; and is classified into nine types, each for a specific variety of diseases.

=== Japan ===

In Japan, shiatsu is regulated but oil massage and Thai massage are not. Prostitution in Japan is not heavily policed, and prostitutes posing as massage therapists in &quot;fashion health&quot; shops and &quot;pink salons&quot; are fairly common in the larger cities.

=== Myanmar ===
In Myanmar, massage is unregulated. However, it is necessary to apply for a spa license with the government to operate a massage parlor in major cities such as Yangon. Blind and visually impaired people can become masseurs, but they are not issued licenses. There are a few professional spa training schools in Myanmar but these training centers are not accredited by the government.

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico massage therapists, called &quot;sobadores&quot;, combine massage using oil or lotion with a form of acupuncture and faith. &quot;Sobadores&quot; are used to relieve digestive system problems as well as knee and back pain. Many of these therapists work out of the back of a truck, with just a curtain for privacy. By learning additional holistic healer&#x27;s skills in addition to massage, the practitioner may become a &quot;curandero&quot;.

In some jurisdictions, prostitution in Mexico is legal, and prostitutes are allowed to sell sexual massages. These businesses are often confined to a specific area of the city, such as the Zona Norte in Tijuana.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, massage is unregulated. There are two levels of registration with Massage New Zealand, the professional body for massage therapists within New Zealand, although neither of these levels are government recognized. Registration at the certified massage therapist level denotes competency in the practice of relaxation massage. Registration at the remedial massage therapist denotes competency in the practice of remedial or orthopedic massage. Both levels of registration are defined by agreed minimum competencies and minimum hours.

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, massage is regulated, but enforcement is poor. The minimum legal requirement to be able to practice as a professional massage therapist is a two-year diploma in therapeutic massage and registration with the Allied Health Professions Council of SA (AHPCSA). The qualification includes 240 credits, about 80 case studies, and about 100 hours of community service.

=== South Korea ===
In South Korea, only blind and visually impaired people can become licensed masseurs.

=== Thailand ===
In Thailand, Thai massage is officially listed as one of the branches of traditional Thai medicine, recognized and regulated by the government. It is considered to be a medical discipline in its own right and is used for the treatment of a wide variety of ailments and conditions. Massage schools, centers, therapists, and practitioners are increasingly regulated by the Ministries of Education and Public Health in Thailand.

=== United Kingdom ===
To practice commercial massage or massage therapy in the UK, an ITEC or VTCT certificate must be obtained through training which includes Beauty and Spa Therapy, Hairdressing, Complementary Therapies, Sports &amp; Fitness Training and Customer Service.

Therapists with appropriate paperwork and insurance may join the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC), a voluntary, government regulated, professional register. Its key aim is to protect the public.

In addition, there are many professional bodies that have a required minimum standard of education and hold relevant insurance policies including the Federation of Holistic Therapists (FHT), the Complementary Therapists Association (CThA), and the Complementary Health Professionals (CHP). In contrast to the CNHC these bodies exist to support therapists rather than clients.

=== United States ===

According to research done by the American Massage Therapy Association, as of 2012 in the United States, there are between 280,000 and 320,000 massage therapists and massage school students. As of 2022, there are an estimated 872 state-approved massage training programs operating in the U.S. Most states have licensing requirements that must be met before a practitioner can use the title &quot;massage therapist&quot;, and some states and municipalities require a license to practice any form of massage. If a state does not have any massage laws then a practitioner need not apply for a license with the state. Training programs in the US are typically 500 hours to 1000 hours in total training time and can award a certificate, diploma, or degree depending on the particular school. Study will often include anatomy and physiology, kinesiology, massage techniques, first aid and CPR, business, ethical and legal issues, and hands-on practice along with continuing education requirements if regulated. The Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation (COMTA) is one of the organizations that works with massage schools in the U.S. and there are almost 300 schools that are accredited through this agency.

Forty-seven states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia currently offer some type of credential to professionals in the massage and bodywork field—usually licensure, certification or registration. Forty-five states require some type of licensing for massage therapists. There are two nationally recognized tests gain a massage therapy license, as well as state-specific exams. In the US, 38 states accept the now defunct National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork&#x27;s (NCBTMB) certification program as a basis for granting licenses either by rule or statute. The NCBTMB formerly offered the designation Nationally Certified in Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCTMB) but now only offers its certificate program, Board Certification in Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (BCTMB) which does not qualify for licensure. Forty-three states, as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, accept the Massage &amp; Bodywork Licensing Examination (MBLEx), administered by the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (FSMTB). Between 10% and 20% of towns or counties independently regulate the profession. These local regulations can range from prohibition on opposite sex massage, fingerprinting and venereal checks from a doctor, to prohibition on house calls because of concern regarding sale of sexual services.

In the US, licensure is the highest level of regulation and this restricts anyone without a license from practicing massage therapy or calling themselves by that protected title. Certification allows only those who meet certain educational criteria to use the protected title and registration only requires a listing of therapists who apply and meet an educational requirement. In the US, most certifications are locally based. A massage therapist may be certified, but not licensed. Licensing requirements vary per state, and often require additional criteria be met in addition to attending an accredited massage therapy school and passing a required state-specified exam. Only Kansas, Minnesota, and Wyoming, California and Vermont do not require a license or a certification at the state level. Some states allow license reciprocity, where licensed massage therapists who relocate can relatively easily obtain a license in their new state.

In New York State in 2024, a man was arrested and charged with three counts of third-degree Sexual Abuse and three counts of Forcible Touching, as well as New York State Education Department Law violations, for providing massage therapy services without a New York State license to do so.

In 1997 there were an estimated 114 million visits to massage therapists in the US. Massage therapy is the most used type of alternative medicine in hospitals in the United States. Between July 2010 and July 2011 roughly 38 million adult Americans (18 percent) had a massage at least once. People state that they use massage because they believe that it relieves pain from musculoskeletal injuries and other causes of pain, reduces stress and enhances relaxation, rehabilitates sports injuries, decreases feelings of anxiety and depression, and increases general well-being.

In a poll of 25–35-year-olds, 79% said they would like their health insurance plan to cover massage. In 2006 Duke University Health System opened up a center to integrate medical disciplines with CAM disciplines such as massage therapy and acupuncture. There were 15,500 spas in the United States in 2007, with about two-thirds of the visitors being women.

The number of visits rose from 91 million in 1999 to 136 million in 2003, generating a revenue that equals $11 billion. Job outlook for massage therapists was also projected to grow at 20% between 2010 and 2020 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, faster than the average.

<text>A biofilm is a syntrophic community of microorganisms in which cells stick to each other and often also to a surface. These adherent cells become embedded within a slimy extracellular matrix that is composed of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). The cells within the biofilm produce the EPS components, which are typically a polymeric combination of extracellular polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and DNA. Because they have a three-dimensional structure and represent a community lifestyle for microorganisms, they have been metaphorically described as &quot;cities for microbes&quot;.

Biofilms may form on living (biotic) or non-living (abiotic) surfaces and can be common in natural, industrial, and hospital settings. They may constitute a microbiome or be a portion of it. The microbial cells growing in a biofilm are physiologically distinct from planktonic cells of the same organism, which, by contrast, are single cells that may float or swim in a liquid medium. Biofilms can form on the teeth of most animals as dental plaque, where they may cause tooth decay and gum disease.

Microbes form a biofilm in response to a number of different factors, which may include cellular recognition of specific or non-specific attachment sites on a surface, nutritional cues, or in some cases, by exposure of planktonic cells to sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. A cell that switches to the biofilm mode of growth undergoes a phenotypic shift in behavior in which large suites of genes are differentially regulated.

A biofilm may also be considered a hydrogel, which is a complex polymer that contains many times its dry weight in water. Biofilms are not just bacterial slime layers but biological systems; the bacteria organize themselves into a coordinated functional community. Biofilms can attach to a surface such as a tooth or rock, and may include a single species or a diverse group of microorganisms. Subpopulations of cells within the biofilm differentiate to perform various activities for motility, matrix production, and sporulation, supporting the overall success of the biofilm. The biofilm bacteria can share nutrients and are sheltered from harmful factors in the environment, such as desiccation, antibiotics, and a host body&#x27;s immune system. A biofilm usually begins to form when a free-swimming, planktonic bacterium attaches to a surface.

== Origin and formation ==
=== Origin of biofilms ===
Biofilms are thought to have arisen during primitive Earth as a defense mechanism for prokaryotes, as the conditions at that time were too harsh for their survival. They can be found very early in Earth&#x27;s fossil records (about 3.25 billion years ago) as both Archaea and Bacteria, and commonly protect prokaryotic cells by providing them with homeostasis, encouraging the development of complex interactions between the cells in the biofilm.

=== Formation of biofilms ===

The formation of a biofilm begins with the attachment of free-floating microorganisms to a surface. The first colonist bacteria of a biofilm may adhere to the surface initially by the weak van der Waals forces and hydrophobic effects. If the colonists are not immediately separated from the surface, they can anchor themselves more permanently using cell adhesion structures such as pili. A unique group of Archaea that inhabit anoxic groundwater have similar structures called hami. Each hamus is a long tube with three hook attachments that are used to attach to each other or to a surface, enabling a community to develop. Hyperthermophilic archaeon &quot;Pyrobaculum calidifontis&quot; produce bundling pili which are homologous to the bacterial TasA filaments, a major component of the extracellular matrix in bacterial biofilms, which contribute to biofilm stability. TasA homologs are encoded by many other archaea, suggesting mechanistic similarities and evolutionary connection between bacterial and archaeal biofilms.

Hydrophobicity can also affect the ability of bacteria to form biofilms. Bacteria with increased hydrophobicity have reduced repulsion between the substratum and the bacterium. Some bacteria species are not able to attach to a surface on their own successfully due to their limited motility but are instead able to anchor themselves to the matrix or directly to other, earlier bacteria colonists. Non-motile bacteria cannot recognize surfaces or aggregate together as easily as motile bacteria.

During surface colonization bacteria cells are able to communicate using quorum sensing (QS) products such as N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL). Once colonization has begun, the biofilm grows by a combination of cell division and recruitment. Polysaccharide matrices typically enclose bacterial biofilms. The matrix exopolysaccharides can trap QS autoinducers within the biofilm to prevent predator detection and ensure bacterial survival. In addition to the polysaccharides, these matrices may also contain material from the surrounding environment, including but not limited to minerals, soil particles, and blood components, such as erythrocytes and fibrin. The final stage of biofilm formation is known as development, and is the stage in which the biofilm is established and may only change in shape and size.

The development of a biofilm may allow for an aggregate cell colony to be increasingly tolerant or resistant to antibiotics. Cell-cell communication or quorum sensing has been shown to be involved in the formation of biofilm in several bacterial species.

== Development ==
Biofilms are the product of a microbial developmental process. The process is summarized by five major stages of biofilm development, as shown in the diagram below:

== Dispersal ==
Dispersal of cells from the biofilm colony is an essential stage of the biofilm life cycle. Dispersal enables biofilms to spread and colonize new surfaces. Enzymes that degrade the biofilm extracellular matrix, such as dispersin B and deoxyribonuclease, may contribute to biofilm dispersal. Enzymes that degrade the biofilm matrix may be useful as anti-biofilm agents. Evidence has shown that a fatty acid messenger, &quot;cis&quot;-2-decenoic acid, is capable of inducing dispersion and inhibiting growth of biofilm colonies. Secreted by &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, this compound induces cyclo heteromorphic cells in several species of bacteria and the yeast &quot;Candida albicans&quot;.
Nitric oxide has also been shown to trigger the dispersal of biofilms of several bacteria species at sub-toxic concentrations. Nitric oxide has potential as a treatment for patients that have chronic infections caused by biofilms.

It was generally assumed that cells dispersed from biofilms immediately go into the planktonic growth phase. However, studies have shown that the physiology of dispersed cells from &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; biofilms is highly different from that of planktonic and biofilm cells. Hence, the dispersal process is a unique stage during the transition from biofilm to planktonic lifestyle in bacteria. Dispersed cells are found to be highly virulent against macrophages and &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, but highly sensitive towards iron stress, as compared with planktonic cells.

Furthermore, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; biofilms undergo distinct spatiotemporal dynamics during biofilm dispersal or disassembly, with contrasting consequences in recolonization and disease dissemination. Biofilm dispersal induced bacteria to activate dispersal genes to actively depart from biofilms as single cells at consistent velocities but could not recolonize fresh surfaces. In contrast, biofilm disassembly by degradation of a biofilm exopolysaccharide released immotile aggregates at high initial velocities, enabling the bacteria to recolonize fresh surfaces and cause infections in the hosts efficiently. Hence, biofilm dispersal is more complex than previously thought, where bacterial populations adopting distinct behavior after biofilm departure may be the key to survival of bacterial species and dissemination of diseases.

== Properties ==
Biofilms are usually found on solid submerged in or exposed to an aqueous solution, although they can form as floating mats on liquid surfaces and also on the surface of leaves, particularly in high humidity climates. Given sufficient resources for growth, a biofilm will quickly grow to be macroscopic (visible to the naked eye). Biofilms can contain many different types of microorganism, e.g. bacteria, archaea, protozoa, fungi and algae; each group performs specialized metabolic functions. However, some organisms will form single-species films under certain conditions. The social structure (cooperation/competition) within a biofilm depends highly on the different species present.

=== Extracellular matrix ===

The EPS matrix consists of exopolysaccharides, proteins and nucleic acids. A large proportion of the EPS is more or less strongly hydrated, however, hydrophobic EPS also occur; one example is cellulose which is produced by a range of microorganisms. This matrix encases the cells within it and facilitates communication among them through biochemical signals as well as gene exchange. The EPS matrix also traps extracellular enzymes and keeps them in close proximity to the cells. Thus, the matrix represents an external digestion system and allows for stable synergistic microconsortia of different species. Some biofilms have been found to contain water channels that help distribute nutrients and signalling molecules. This matrix is strong enough that under certain conditions, biofilms can become fossilized (stromatolites).

Bacteria living in a biofilm usually have significantly different properties from free-floating bacteria of the same species, as the dense and protected environment of the film allows them to cooperate and interact in various ways. One benefit of this environment is increased resistance to detergents and antibiotics, as the dense extracellular matrix and the outer layer of cells protect the interior of the community. In some cases antibiotic resistance can be increased up to 5,000 times. Lateral gene transfer is often facilitated within bacterial and archaeal biofilms and can leads to a more stable biofilm structure. Extracellular DNA is a major structural component of many different microbial biofilms. Enzymatic degradation of extracellular DNA can weaken the biofilm structure and release microbial cells from the surface.

However, biofilms are not always less susceptible to antibiotics. For instance, the biofilm form of &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; has no greater resistance to antimicrobials than do stationary-phase planktonic cells, although when the biofilm is compared to logarithmic-phase planktonic cells, the biofilm does have greater resistance to antimicrobials. This resistance to antibiotics in both stationary-phase cells and biofilms may be due to the presence of persister cells.

== Habitats ==
Biofilms are ubiquitous in organic life. Nearly every species of microorganism have mechanisms by which they can adhere to surfaces and to each other. Biofilms will form on virtually every non-shedding surface in non-sterile aqueous or humid environments. Biofilms can grow in the most extreme environments: from, for example, the extremely hot, briny waters of hot springs ranging from very acidic to very alkaline, to frozen glaciers.

Biofilms can be found on rocks and pebbles at the bottoms of most streams or rivers and often form on the surfaces of stagnant pools of water. Biofilms are important components of food chains in rivers and streams and are grazed by the aquatic invertebrates upon which many fish feed. Biofilms are found on the surface of and inside plants. They can either contribute to crop disease or, as in the case of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia on root nodules, exist symbiotically with the plant. Examples of crop diseases related to biofilms include citrus canker, Pierce&#x27;s disease of grapes, and bacterial spot of plants such as peppers and tomatoes.

===Percolating filters===
Percolating filters in sewage treatment works are highly effective removers of pollutants from settled sewage liquor. They work by trickling the liquid over a bed of hard material which is designed to have a very large surface area. A complex biofilm develops on the surface of the medium which absorbs, adsorbs and metabolises the pollutants. The biofilm grows rapidly and when it becomes too thick to retain its grip on the media it washes off and is replaced by newly grown film. The washed off (&quot;sloughed&quot; off) film is settled out of the liquid stream to leave a highly purified effluent.

===Slow sand filter===
Slow sand filters are used in water purification for treating raw water to produce a potable product. They work through the formation of a biofilm called the hypogeal layer or &quot;Schmutzdecke&quot; in the top few millimetres of the fine sand layer. The &quot;Schmutzdecke&quot; is formed in the first 10–20 days of operation and consists of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, rotifera and a range of aquatic insect larvae. As an epigeal biofilm ages, more algae tend to develop and larger aquatic organisms may be present including some bryozoa, snails and annelid worms. The surface biofilm is the layer that provides the effective purification in potable water treatment, the underlying sand providing the support medium for this biological treatment layer. As water passes through the hypogeal layer, particles of foreign matter are trapped in the mucilaginous matrix and soluble organic material is adsorbed. The contaminants are metabolised by the bacteria, fungi and protozoa. The water produced from an exemplary slow sand filter is of excellent quality with 90–99% bacterial cell count reduction.

=== Rhizosphere ===
Plant-beneficial microbes can be categorized as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria. These plant growth-promoters colonize the roots of plants, and provide a wide range of beneficial functions for their host including nitrogen fixation, pathogen suppression, anti-fungal properties, and the breakdown of organic materials. One of these functions is the defense against pathogenic, soil-borne bacteria and fungi by way of induced systemic resistance (ISR) or induced systemic responses triggered by pathogenic microbes (pathogen-induced systemic acquired resistance). Plant exudates act as chemical signals for host specific bacteria to colonize. Rhizobacteria colonization steps include attractions, recognition, adherence, colonization, and growth. Bacteria that have been shown to be beneficial and form biofilms include &quot;Bacillus, Pseudomonas,&quot; and &quot;Azospirillum&quot;. Biofilms in the rhizosphere often result in pathogen or plant induced systemic resistances. Molecular properties on the surface of the bacterium cause an immune response in the plant host. These microbe associated molecules interact with receptors on the surface of plant cells, and activate a biochemical response that is thought to include several different genes at a number of loci. Several other signaling molecules have been linked to both induced systemic responses and pathogen-induced systemic responses, such as jasmonic acid and ethylene. Cell envelope components such as bacterial flagella and lipopolysaccharides, which are recognized by plant cells as components of pathogens. Certain iron metabolites produced by &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; have also been shown to create an induced systemic response. This function of the biofilm helps plants build stronger resistance to pathogens.

Plants that have been colonized by PGPR forming a biofilm have gained systemic resistances and are primed for defense against pathogens. This means that the genes necessary for the production of proteins that work towards defending the plant against pathogens have been expressed, and the plant has a &quot;stockpile&quot; of compounds to release to fight off pathogens. A primed defense system is much faster in responding to pathogen induced infection, and may be able to deflect pathogens before they are able to establish themselves. Plants increase the production of lignin, reinforcing cell walls and making it difficult for pathogens to penetrate into the cell, while also cutting off nutrients to already infected cells, effectively halting the invasion. They produce antimicrobial compounds such as phytoalexins, chitinases, and proteinase inhibitors, which prevent the growth of pathogens. These functions of disease suppression and pathogen resistance ultimately lead to an increase in agricultural production and a decrease in the use of chemical pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides because there is a reduced amount of crop loss due to disease. Induced systemic resistance and pathogen-induced systemic acquired resistance are both potential functions of biofilms in the rhizosphere, and should be taken into consideration when applied to new age agricultural practices because of their effect on disease suppression without the use of dangerous chemicals.

===Mammalian gut===
Studies in 2003 discovered that the immune system supports biofilm development in the large intestine. This was supported mainly with the fact that the two most abundantly produced molecules by the immune system also support biofilm production and are associated with the biofilms developed in the gut. This is especially important because the appendix holds a mass amount of these bacterial biofilms. This discovery helps to distinguish the possible function of the appendix and the idea that the appendix can help reinoculate the gut with good gut flora. However, modified or disrupted states of biofilms in the gut have been connected to diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.

===Human environment===
In the human environment, biofilms can grow in showers very easily since they provide a moist and warm environment for them to thrive. Mold biofilms on ceilings may form due to roof leaks. They can form inside water and sewage pipes and cause clogging and corrosion. On floors and counters, they can make sanitation difficult in food preparation areas. In soil, they can cause bioclogging. In cooling- or heating-water systems, they are known to reduce heat transfer. Biofilms in marine engineering systems, such as pipelines of the offshore oil and gas industry, can lead to substantial corrosion problems. Corrosion is mainly due to abiotic factors; however, at least 20% of corrosion is caused by microorganisms that are attached to the metal subsurface (i.e., microbially influenced corrosion).

===Ship fouling===
Bacterial adhesion to boat hulls serves as the foundation for biofouling of seagoing vessels. Once a film of bacteria forms, it is easier for other marine organisms such as barnacles to attach. Such fouling can reduce maximum vessel speed by up to 20%, prolonging voyages and consuming fuel. Time in dry dock for refitting and repainting reduces the productivity of shipping assets, and the useful life of ships is also reduced due to corrosion and mechanical removal (scraping) of marine organisms from ships&#x27; hulls.

===Stromatolites===
Stromatolites are layered accretionary structures formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains by microbial biofilms, especially of cyanobacteria. Stromatolites include some of the most ancient records of life on Earth, and are still forming today.

=== Dental plaque ===
Within the human body, biofilms are present on the teeth as dental plaque, where they may cause tooth decay and gum disease. These biofilms can either be in an uncalcified state that can be removed by dental instruments, or a calcified state which is more difficult to remove. Removal techniques can also include antimicrobials.

Dental plaque is an oral biofilm that adheres to the teeth and consists of many species of both bacteria and fungi (such as &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot; and &quot;Candida albicans&quot;), embedded in salivary polymers and microbial extracellular products. The accumulation of microorganisms subjects the teeth and gingival tissues to high concentrations of bacterial metabolites which results in dental disease. Biofilm on the surface of teeth is frequently subject to oxidative stress and acid stress. Dietary carbohydrates can cause a dramatic decrease in pH in oral biofilms to values of 4 and below (acid stress). A pH of 4 at body temperature of 37 °C causes depurination of DNA, leaving apurinic (AP) sites in DNA, especially loss of guanine.

Dental plaque biofilm can result in dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from balanced populations within the dental biofilm is driven by certain (cariogenic) microbiological populations beginning to dominate when the environment favors them. The shift to an acidogenic, aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary carbohydrate. The resulting activity shift in the biofilm (and resulting acid production within the biofilm, at the tooth surface) is associated with an imbalance of demineralization over remineralization, leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues (enamel and then dentin), the symptom being a carious lesion, or cavity. By preventing the dental plaque biofilm from maturing or by returning it back to a non-cariogenic state, dental caries can be prevented and arrested. This can be achieved through the behavioral step of reducing the supply of fermentable carbohydrates (i.e. sugar intake) and frequent removal of the biofilm (i.e., toothbrushing).

====Intercellular communication====

A peptide pheromone quorum sensing signaling system in &quot;S. mutans&quot; includes the competence stimulating peptide (CSP) that controls genetic competence. Genetic competence is the ability of a cell to take up DNA released by another cell. Competence can lead to genetic transformation, a form of sexual interaction, favored under conditions of high cell density and/or stress where there is maximal opportunity for interaction between the competent cell and the DNA released from nearby donor cells. This system is optimally expressed when &quot;S. mutans&quot; cells reside in an actively growing biofilm. Biofilm grown &quot;S. mutans&quot; cells are genetically transformed at a rate 10- to 600-fold higher than &quot;S. mutans&quot; growing as free-floating planktonic cells suspended in liquid.

When the biofilm, containing &quot;S. mutans&quot; and related oral streptococci, is subjected to acid stress, the competence regulon is induced, leading to resistance to being killed by acid. As pointed out by Michod et al., transformation in bacterial pathogens likely provides for effective and efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages. It appears that &quot;S. mutans&quot; can survive the frequent acid stress in oral biofilms, in part, through the recombinational repair provided by competence and transformation.

Predator-prey interactions

Predator-prey interactions between biofilms and bacterivores, such as the soil-dwelling nematode &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans,&quot; had been extensively studied. Via the production of sticky matrix and formation of aggregates, &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; biofilms can prevent feeding by obstructing the mouth of &quot;C. elegans&quot;. Moreover, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; biofilms can impede the slithering motility of &quot;C. elegans&quot;, termed as &#x27;quagmire phenotype&#x27;, resulting in trapping of &quot;C. elegans&quot; within the biofilms and preventing the exploration of nematodes to feed on susceptible biofilms. This significantly reduced the ability of predator to feed and reproduce, thereby promoting the survival of biofilms. &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; biofilms can also mask their chemical signatures, where they reduced the diffusion of quorum sensing molecules into the environment and prevented the detection of &quot;C. elegans&quot;.

== Taxonomic diversity ==
Many different bacteria form biofilms, including gram-positive (e.g. &quot;Bacillus&quot; spp, &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; spp, and lactic acid bacteria, including &quot;Lactobacillus plantarum&quot; and &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot;) and gram-negative species (e.g. &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, or &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;). Cyanobacteria also form biofilms in aquatic environments.

Biofilms are formed by bacteria that colonize plants, e.g. &quot;Pseudomonas putida&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot;, and related pseudomonads which are common plant-associated bacteria found on leaves, roots, and in the soil, and the majority of their natural isolates form biofilms. Several nitrogen-fixing symbionts of legumes such as &quot;Rhizobium leguminosarum&quot; and &quot;Sinorhizobium meliloti&quot; form biofilms on legume roots and other inert surfaces.

Along with bacteria, biofilms are also generated by archaea and by a range of eukaryotic organisms, including fungi e.g. &quot;Cryptococcus laurentii&quot; and microalgae. Among microalgae, one of the main progenitors of biofilms are diatoms, which colonise both fresh and marine environments worldwide.

For other species in disease-associated biofilms and biofilms arising from eukaryotes, see below.

== Infectious diseases ==
Biofilms have been found to be involved in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body, by one estimate 80% of all infections. Infectious processes in which biofilms have been implicated include common problems such as bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infections, catheter infections, middle-ear infections, formation of dental plaque, gingivitis, coating contact lenses, and less common but more lethal processes such as endocarditis, infections in cystic fibrosis, and infections of permanent indwelling devices such as joint prostheses, heart valves, and intervertebral disc. The first visual evidence of a biofilm was recorded after spine surgery. It was found that in the absence of clinical presentation of infection, impregnated bacteria could form a biofilm around an implant, and this biofilm can remain undetected via contemporary diagnostic methods, including swabbing. Implant biofilm is frequently present in &quot;aseptic&quot; pseudarthrosis cases. Furthermore, it has been noted that bacterial biofilms may impair cutaneous wound healing and reduce topical antibacterial efficiency in healing or treating infected skin wounds. The diversity of &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; cells within a biofilm is thought to make it harder to treat the infected lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. Early detection of biofilms in wounds is crucial to successful chronic wound management. Although many techniques have developed to identify planktonic bacteria in viable wounds, few have been able to quickly and accurately identify bacterial biofilms. Future studies are needed to find means of identifying and monitoring biofilm colonization at the bedside to permit timely initiation of treatment.

It has been shown that biofilms are present on the removed tissue of 80% of patients undergoing surgery for chronic sinusitis. The patients with biofilms were shown to have been denuded of cilia and goblet cells, unlike the controls without biofilms who had normal cilia and goblet cell morphology. Biofilms were also found on samples from two of 10 healthy controls mentioned. The species of bacteria from intraoperative cultures did not correspond to the bacteria species in the biofilm on the respective patient&#x27;s tissue. In other words, the cultures were negative though the bacteria were present. New staining techniques are being developed to differentiate bacterial cells growing in living animals, e.g. from tissues with allergy-inflammations.

Research has shown that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam antibiotics induce biofilm formation in &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. This sub-therapeutic level of antibiotic may result from the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture, or during the normal course of antibiotic therapy. The biofilm formation induced by low-level methicillin was inhibited by DNase, suggesting that the sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotic also induce extracellular DNA release. Moreover, from an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide advanced therapeutic ways for chronic infections caused by biofilms via genetically engineered invasive cheaters who can invade wild-types &#x27;cooperators&#x27; of pathogenic bacteria until cooperator populations go to extinction or overall population &#x27;cooperators and cheaters &#x27; go to extinction.

=== &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; ===
&quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; represents a commonly used biofilm model organism since it is involved in different types of biofilm-associated chronic infections. Examples of such infections include chronic wounds, chronic otitis media, chronic prostatitis and chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. About 80% of CF patients have chronic lung infection, caused mainly by &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; growing in a non-surface attached biofilms surround by PMN. The infection remains present despite aggressive antibiotic therapy and is a common cause of death in CF patients due to constant inflammatory damage to the lungs. In patients with CF, one therapy for treating early biofilm development is to employ DNase to structurally weaken the biofilm.

Biofilm formation of &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot;, along with other bacteria, is found in 90% of chronic wound infections, which leads to poor healing and high cost of treatment estimated at more than US$25 billion every year in the United States. In order to minimize the &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; infection, host epithelial cells secrete antimicrobial peptides, such as lactoferrin, to prevent the formation of the biofilms.

=== &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; ===
&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; is the main cause of community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis in children and the elderly, and of sepsis in HIV-infected persons. When &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; grows in biofilms, genes are specifically expressed that respond to oxidative stress and induce competence. Formation of a biofilm depends on competence stimulating peptide (CSP). CSP also functions as a quorum-sensing peptide. It not only induces biofilm formation, but also increases virulence in pneumonia and meningitis.

It has been proposed that competence development and biofilm formation is an adaptation of &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; to survive the defenses of the host. In particular, the host&#x27;s polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce an oxidative burst to defend against the invading bacteria, and this response can kill bacteria by damaging their DNA. Competent &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; in a biofilm have the survival advantage that they can more easily take up transforming DNA from nearby cells in the biofilm to use for recombinational repair of oxidative damages in their DNA. Competent &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; can also secrete an enzyme (murein hydrolase) that destroys non-competent cells (fratricide) causing DNA to be released into the surrounding medium for potential use by the competent cells.

The insect antimicrobial peptide cecropin A can destroy planktonic and sessile biofilm-forming uropathogenic &quot;E. coli&quot; cells, either alone or when combined with the antibiotic nalidixic acid, synergistically clearing infection in vivo (in the insect host &quot;Galleria mellonella&quot;) without off-target cytotoxicity. The multi-target mechanism of action involves outer membrane permeabilization followed by biofilm disruption triggered by the inhibition of efflux pump activity and interactions with extracellular and intracellular nucleic acids.

=== &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; ===
&quot;Escherichia coli&quot; biofilms are responsible for many intestinal infectious diseases. The Extraintestinal group of &quot;E. coli&quot; (ExPEC) is the dominant bacterial group that attacks the urinary system, which leads to urinary tract infections. The biofilm formation of these pathogenic &quot;E. coli&quot; is hard to eradicate due to the complexity of its aggregation structure, and it has a significant contribution to developing aggressive medical complications, increase in hospitalization rate, and cost of treatment. The development of &quot;E. coli&quot; biofilm is a common leading cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) in hospitals through its contribution to developing medical device-associated infections. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) represent the most common hospital-acquired infection due to the formation of the pathogenic &quot;E. coli biofilm&quot; inside the catheters.

=== &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; ===
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; pathogen can attack skin and lungs, leading to skin infection and pneumonia. Moreover, the biofilm infections network of &quot;S. aureus&quot; plays a critical role in preventing immune cells, such as macrophages from eliminating and destroying bacterial cells. Furthermore, biofilm formation by bacteria, such as &quot;S. aureus&quot;, not only develops resistance against antibiotic medication but also develop internal resistance toward antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), leading to preventing the inhibition of the pathogen and maintaining its survival.

=== &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot; ===
&quot;Serratia marcescens&quot; is a fairly common opportunistic pathogen that can form biofilms on various surfaces, including medical devices such as catheters and implants, as well as natural environments like soil and water. The formation of biofilms by &quot;S. marcescens&quot; is a serious concern because of its ability to adhere to and colonize surfaces, protecting itself from host immune responses and antimicrobial agents. This strength makes infections caused by &quot;S. marcescens&quot; challenging to treat, specifically in hospitals where the bacterium can cause severe, and specific, infections.

Research suggests that biofilm formation by S. marcescens is a process controlled by both nutrient cues and the quorum-sensing system. Quorum sensing influences the bacterium&#x27;s ability to adhere to surfaces and establish mature biofilms, whereas the availability of specific nutrients can enhance or inhibit biofilm development.

&quot;S. marcescens&quot; creates biofilms that ultimately develop into a highly porous, thread-like structure composed of chains of cells, filaments, and cell clusters. Research has shown that &quot;S. marcescens&quot; biofilms exhibit complex structural organization, including the formation of microcolonies and channels that facilitate nutrient and waste exchange. The production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) is a key factor in biofilm development, contributing to the bacterium&#x27;s adhesion and resistance to antimicrobial agents. In addition to its role in healthcare-associated infections, &quot;S. marcescens&quot; biofilms have been implicated in the deterioration of industrial equipment and processes. For example, biofilm growth in cooling towers can lead to biofouling and reduced efficiency.

Efforts to control and prevent biofilm formation by &quot;S. marcescens&quot; involve the use of antimicrobial coatings on medical devices, the development of targeted biofilm disruptors, and improved sterilization protocols. Further research into the molecular mechanisms governing &quot;S. marcescens&quot; biofilm formation and persistence is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat its associated risks. The use of indole compounds has been studied to be used as protection against biofilm formation.

== Uses and impact ==
=== In medicine ===
It is suggested that around two-thirds of bacterial infections in humans involve biofilms. Infections associated with the biofilm growth usually are challenging to eradicate. This is mostly due to the fact that mature biofilms display antimicrobial tolerance, and immune response evasions. Biofilms often form on the inert surfaces of implanted devices such as catheters, prosthetic cardiac valves and intrauterine devices. Some of the most difficult infections to treat are those associated with the use of medical devices.

The rapidly expanding worldwide industry for biomedical devices and tissue engineering related products is already at $180 billion per year, yet this industry continues to suffer from microbial colonization. No matter the sophistication, microbial infections can develop on all medical devices and tissue engineering constructs. 60-70% of hospital-acquired infections are associated with the implantation of a biomedical device. This leads to 2 million cases annually in the U.S., costing the healthcare system over $5 billion in additional healthcare expenses.

The level of antibiotic resistance in a biofilm is much greater than that of non-biofilm bacteria, and can be as much as 5,000 times greater. The extracellular matrix of biofilm is considered one of the leading factors that can reduce the penetration of antibiotics into a biofilm structure and contributes to antibiotic resistance. Further, it has been demonstrated that the evolution of resistance to antibiotics may be affected by the biofilm lifestyle. Bacteriophage therapy can disperse the biofilm generated by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

It has been shown that the introduction of a small current of electricity to the liquid surrounding a biofilm, together with small amounts of antibiotic can reduce the level of antibiotic resistance to levels of non-biofilm bacteria. This is termed the bioelectric effect. The application of a small DC current on its own can cause a biofilm to detach from its surface. A study showed that the type of current used made no difference to the bioelectric effect.

=== In industry ===

Biofilms can also be harnessed for constructive purposes. For example, many sewage treatment plants include a secondary treatment stage in which waste water passes over biofilms grown on filters, which extract and digest organic compounds. In such biofilms, bacteria are mainly responsible for removal of organic matter (BOD), while protozoa and rotifers are mainly responsible for removal of suspended solids (SS), including pathogens and other microorganisms. Slow sand filters rely on biofilm development in the same way to filter surface water from lake, spring or river sources for drinking purposes. What is regarded as clean water is effectively a waste material to these microcellular organisms. Biofilms can help eliminate petroleum oil from contaminated oceans or marine systems. The oil is eliminated by the hydrocarbon-degrading activities of communities of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (HCB).
Biofilms are used in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to generate electricity from a variety of starting materials, including complex organic waste and renewable biomass.
Biofilms are also relevant for the improvement of metal dissolution in bioleaching industry, and aggregation of microplastics pollutants for convenient removal from the environment.

=== Food industry ===
Biofilms have become problematic in several food industries due to the ability to form on plants and during industrial processes. Bacteria can survive long periods of time in water, animal manure, and soil, causing biofilm formation on plants or in the processing equipment. The buildup of biofilms can affect the heat flow across a surface and increase surface corrosion and frictional resistance of fluids. These can lead to a loss of energy in a system and overall loss of products. Along with economic problems, biofilm formation on food poses a health risk to consumers due to the ability to make the food more resistant to disinfectants As a result, from 1996 to 2010 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 48 million foodborne illnesses per year. Biofilms have been connected to about 80% of bacterial infections in the United States.

In produce, microorganisms attach to the surfaces and biofilms develop internally. During the washing process, biofilms resist sanitization and allow bacteria to spread across the produce, especially via kitchen utensils. This problem is also found in ready-to-eat foods, because the foods go through limited cleaning procedures before consumption Due to the perishability of dairy products and limitations in cleaning procedures, resulting in the buildup of bacteria, dairy is susceptible to biofilm formation and contamination. The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One species of bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of foodborne disease is &quot;Salmonella&quot;. Large amounts of Salmonella contamination can be found in the poultry processing industry as about 50% of &quot;Salmonella&quot; strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms. &quot;Salmonella&quot; increases the risk of foodborne illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly. &quot;Salmonella&quot; is also found in the seafood industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on the seafood itself as well as in water. Shrimp products are commonly affected by &quot;Salmonella&quot; because of unhygienic processing and handling techniques The preparation practices of shrimp and other seafood products can allow for bacteria buildup on the products.

New forms of cleaning procedures are being tested to reduce biofilm formation in these processes which will lead to safer and more productive food processing industries. These new forms of cleaning procedures also have a profound effect on the environment, often releasing toxic gases into the groundwater reservoirs. As a response to the aggressive methods employed in controlling biofilm formation, there are a number of novel technologies and chemicals under investigation that can prevent either the proliferation or adhesion of biofilm-secreting microbes. Latest proposed biomolecules presenting marked anti-biofilm activity include a range of metabolites such as bacterial rhamnolipids and even plant- and animal-derived alkaloids.

=== In aquaculture ===

In shellfish and algal aquaculture, biofouling microbial species tend to block nets and cages and ultimately outcompete the farmed species for space and food. Bacterial biofilms start the colonization process by creating microenvironments that are more favorable for biofouling species. In the marine environment, biofilms could reduce the hydrodynamic efficiency of ships and propellers, lead to pipeline blockage and sensor malfunction, and increase the weight of appliances deployed in seawater. Numerous studies have shown that biofilm can be a reservoir for potentially pathogenic bacteria in freshwater aquaculture. Moreover, biofilms are important in establishing infections on the fish. As mentioned previously, biofilms can be difficult to eliminate even when antibiotics or chemicals are used in high doses. The role that biofilm plays as reservoirs of bacterial fish pathogens has not been explored in detail but it certainly deserves to be studied.

== Eukaryotic ==

Along with bacteria, biofilms are often initiated and produced by eukaryotic microbes. The biofilms produced by eukaryotes is usually occupied by bacteria and other eukaryotes alike, however the surface is cultivated and EPS is secreted initially by the eukaryote. Both fungi and microalgae are known to form biofilms in such a way. Biofilms of fungal origin are important aspects of human infection and fungal pathogenicity, as the fungal infection is more resistant to antifungals.

In the environment, fungal biofilms are an area of ongoing research. One key area of research is fungal biofilms on plants. For example, in the soil, plant associated fungi including mycorrhiza have been shown to decompose organic matter and protect plants from bacterial pathogens.

Biofilms in aquatic environments are often founded by diatoms. The exact purpose of these biofilms is unknown, however there is evidence that the EPS produced by diatoms facilitates both cold and salinity stress. These eukaryotes interact with a diverse range of other organisms within a region known as the phycosphere, but importantly are the bacteria associated with diatoms, as it has been shown that although diatoms excrete EPS, they only do so when interacting with certain bacteria species.

== Horizontal gene transfer ==
Horizontal gene transfer is the lateral transfer of genetic material between cellular organisms. It happens frequently in prokaryotes, and less frequently in eukaryotes. In bacteria, horizontal gene transfer can occur through transformation (uptake of free floating DNA in the environment), transduction (virus mediated DNA uptake), or conjugation (transfer of DNA between pili structures of two adjacent bacteria). Recent studies have also uncovered other mechanisms, such as membrane vesicle transmission or gene transfer agents. Biofilms promote horizontal gene transfer in a variety of ways.Bacterial conjugation has been shown to accelerate biofilm formation in difficult environment due to the robust connections established by the conjugative pili. These connections can often foster cross-species transfer events due to the diverse heterogeneity of many biofilms. Additionally, biofilms are structurally confined by a polysaccharide matrix, providing the close spatial requirements for conjugation. Transformation is also frequently observed in biofilms. Bacterial autolysis is a key mechanism in biofilm structural regulation, providing an abundant source of competent DNA primed for transformative uptake. In some instances, inter-biofilm quorum sensing can enhance the competence of free floating eDNA, further promoting transformation. Stx gene transfer through bacteriophage carriers has been witnessed within biofilms, which suggests that biofilms are also a suitable environment for transduction. Membrane vesicles HGT occurs when released membrane vesicles (containing genetic information) fuse with a recipient bacteria, and release genetic material into the bacteria&#x27;s cytoplasm. Recent research has revealed that membrane vesicle HGT can promote single-strain biofilm formation, yet the role membrane vesicle HGT plays in the formation of multistrain biofilms is still unknown. GTAs, or gene transfer agents, are phage-like particles produced by the host bacteria and contain random DNA fragments from the host bacteria genome. HGT within biofilms can confer antibiotic resistance or increased pathogenicity across the biofilms&#x27; population, promoting biofilm homeostasis.

=== Examples ===
Conjugative plasmids may encode biofilm-associated proteins, such as PtgA, PrgB, or PrgC which promote cell adhesion (required for early biofilm formation). Genes encoding type III fimbriae are found in pOLA52 (&quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; plasmid) which promote conjugative-pilus-dependent biofilm formation.

Transformation commonly occurs within biofilms. A phenomenon called fratricide can be seen among streptococcal species in which cell-wall degrading enzymes are released, lysing neighboring bacteria and releasing their DNA. This DNA can then be taken up by the surviving bacteria (transformation). Competence stimulating peptides may play an important role in biofilm formation among &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;S. mutans&quot; as well. Among &quot;V. cholerae&quot;, the competence pilus itself promotes cell aggregation through pilus-pilus interactions at the beginning of biofilm formation.

Phage invasion may play a role in biofilm life cycles, lysing bacteria and releasing their eDNA, which strengthens biofilm structures and can be taken up by neighboring bacteria in transformation. Biofilm destruction caused by the &quot;E. coli&quot; phage Rac and the &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; prophage Pf4 causes detachment of cells from the biofilm. Detachment is a biofilm phenomenon which requires more study, but is hypothesized to proliferate the bacterial species that comprise the biofilm.

Membrane vesicle HGT has been witnessed occurring in marine environments, among &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, and among many other bacterial species. Even though membrane vesicle HGT has been shown as a contributing factor in biofilm formation, research is still required to prove that membrane vesicle mediated HGT occurs within biofilms. Membrane vesicle HGT has also been shown to modulate phage-bacteria interactions in &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; SPP1 phage-resistant cells (lacking the SPP1 receptor protein). Upon exposure to vesicles containing receptors, transduction of pBT163 (a cat-encoding plasmid) occurs, resulting in the expression of the SPP1 receptor protein, opening the receptive bacteria to future phage infection.

Recent research has shown that the archaeal species &quot;H. volcanii&quot; has some biofilm phenotypes similar to bacterial biofilms such as differentiation and HGT, which required cell-cell contact and involved formation of cytosolic bridges and cellular fusion events.

== Cultivation devices ==
There is a wide variety of biofilm cultivation devices to mimic natural or industrial environments. Although it is important to consider that the particular experimental platform for biofilm research determines what kind of biofilm is cultivated and the data that can be extracted. These devices can be grouped into the following:
* microtiter plate (MTP) systems and MBEC Assay® [formerly the Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD)]
* BioFilm Ring Test (BRT) or clinical Biofilm Ring Test (cBRT)
* Robbins Device or modified Robbins Device (such as the MPMR-10PMMA or the Bio-inLine Biofilm Reactor)
* Drip Flow Biofilm Reactor®
* rotary devices (such as the CDC Biofilm Reactor®, the Rotating Disk Reactor, the Biofilm Annular Reactor, the Industrial Surfaces Biofilm Reactor, or the Constant Depth Film Fermenter)
* flow chambers or flow cells (such as the Coupon Evaluation Flow Cell, Transmission Flow Cell, and Capillary Flow Cell from BioSurface Technologies)
* microfluidic approaches, such as 3D-bacterial &quot;biofilm-dispersal-then-recolonization&quot; (BDR) microfluidic model

<text>Star formation is the process by which dense regions within molecular clouds in interstellar space—sometimes referred to as &quot;stellar nurseries&quot; or &quot;star-forming regions&quot;—collapse and form stars. As a branch of astronomy, star formation includes the study of the interstellar medium (ISM) and giant molecular clouds (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of protostars and young stellar objects as its immediate products. It is closely related to planet formation, another branch of astronomy. Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of binary stars and the initial mass function. Most stars do not form in isolation but as part of a group of stars referred as star clusters or stellar associations.

==History==
The first stars were believed to be formed approximately 12-13 billion years ago following the Big Bang. Over intervals of time, stars have fused helium to form a series of chemical elements.

==Stellar nurseries==

===Interstellar clouds===

Spiral galaxies like the Milky Way contain stars, stellar remnants, and a diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) of gas and dust. The interstellar medium consists of 104 to 106 particles per cm3, and is typically composed of roughly 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements by mass. The trace amounts of heavier elements were and are produced within stars via stellar nucleosynthesis and ejected as the stars pass beyond the end of their main sequence lifetime. Higher density regions of the interstellar medium form clouds, or &quot;diffuse nebulae&quot;, where star formation takes place. In contrast to spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies lose the cold component of its interstellar medium within roughly a billion years, which hinders the galaxy from forming diffuse nebulae except through mergers with other galaxies.
In the dense nebulae where stars are produced, much of the hydrogen is in the molecular (H2) form, so these nebulae are called molecular clouds. The Herschel Space Observatory has revealed that filaments, or elongated dense gas structures, are truly ubiquitous in molecular clouds and central to the star formation process. They fragment into gravitationally bound cores, most of which will evolve into stars. Continuous accretion of gas, geometrical bending, and magnetic fields may control the detailed manner in which the filaments are fragmented. Observations of supercritical filaments have revealed quasi-periodic chains of dense cores with spacing comparable to the filament inner width, and embedded protostars with outflows.

Observations indicate that the coldest clouds tend to form low-mass stars, which are first observed via the infrared light they emit inside the clouds, and then as visible light when the clouds dissipate. Giant molecular clouds, which are generally warmer, produce stars of all masses. These giant molecular clouds have typical densities of 100 particles per cm3, diameters of , masses of up to 6 million solar masses (), or six million times the mass of Earth&#x27;s sun. The average interior temperature is .

About half the total mass of the Milky Way&#x27;s galactic ISM is found in molecular clouds and the galaxy includes an estimated 6,000 molecular clouds, each with more than . The nebula nearest to the Sun where massive stars are being formed is the Orion Nebula, away. However, lower mass star formation is occurring about 400–450 light-years distant in the ρ Ophiuchi cloud complex.

A more compact site of star formation is the opaque clouds of dense gas and dust known as Bok globules, so named after the astronomer Bart Bok. These can form in association with collapsing molecular clouds or possibly independently. The Bok globules are typically up to a light-year across and contain a few solar masses. They can be observed as dark clouds silhouetted against bright emission nebulae or background stars. Over half the known Bok globules have been found to contain newly forming stars.
===Cloud collapse===
An interstellar cloud of gas will remain in hydrostatic equilibrium as long as the kinetic energy of the gas pressure is in balance with the potential energy of the internal gravitational force. Mathematically this is expressed using the virial theorem, which states that, to maintain equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must equal twice the internal thermal energy. If a cloud is massive enough that the gas pressure is insufficient to support it, the cloud will undergo gravitational collapse. The mass above which a cloud will undergo such collapse is called the Jeans mass. The Jeans mass depends on the temperature and density of the cloud, but is typically thousands to tens of thousands of solar masses. During cloud collapse dozens to tens of thousands of stars form more or less simultaneously which is observable in so-called embedded clusters. The end product of a core collapse is an open cluster of stars.

In &quot;triggered star formation&quot;, one of several events might occur to compress a molecular cloud and initiate its gravitational collapse. Molecular clouds may collide with each other, or a nearby supernova explosion can be a trigger, sending shocked matter into the cloud at very high speeds. (The resulting new stars may themselves soon produce supernovae, producing self-propagating star formation.) Alternatively, galactic collisions can trigger massive starbursts of star formation as the gas clouds in each galaxy are compressed and agitated by tidal forces. The latter mechanism may be responsible for the formation of globular clusters.

A supermassive black hole at the core of a galaxy may serve to regulate the rate of star formation in a galactic nucleus. A black hole that is accreting infalling matter can become active, emitting a strong wind through a collimated relativistic jet. This can limit further star formation. Massive black holes ejecting radio-frequency-emitting particles at near-light speed can also block the formation of new stars in aging galaxies. However, the radio emissions around the jets may also trigger star formation. Likewise, a weaker jet may trigger star formation when it collides with a cloud.

As it collapses, a molecular cloud breaks into smaller and smaller pieces in a hierarchical manner, until the fragments reach stellar mass. In each of these fragments, the collapsing gas radiates away the energy gained by the release of gravitational potential energy. As the density increases, the fragments become opaque and are thus less efficient at radiating away their energy. This raises the temperature of the cloud and inhibits further fragmentation. The fragments now condense into rotating spheres of gas that serve as stellar embryos.

Complicating this picture of a collapsing cloud are the effects of turbulence, macroscopic flows, rotation, magnetic fields and the cloud geometry. Both rotation and magnetic fields can hinder the collapse of a cloud. Turbulence is instrumental in causing fragmentation of the cloud, and on the smallest scales it promotes collapse.

==Protostar==
A protostellar cloud will continue to collapse as long as the gravitational binding energy can be eliminated. This excess energy is primarily lost through radiation. However, the collapsing cloud will eventually become opaque to its own radiation, and the energy must be removed through some other means. The dust within the cloud becomes heated to temperatures of , and these particles radiate at wavelengths in the far infrared where the cloud is transparent. Thus the dust mediates the further collapse of the cloud.

During the collapse, the density of the cloud increases towards the center and thus the middle region becomes optically opaque first. This occurs when the density is about . A core region, called the first hydrostatic core, forms where the collapse is essentially halted. It continues to increase in temperature as determined by the virial theorem. The gas falling toward this opaque region collides with it and creates shock waves that further heat the core.

When the core temperature reaches about , the thermal energy dissociates the H2 molecules. This is followed by the ionization of the hydrogen and helium atoms. These processes absorb the energy of the contraction, allowing it to continue on timescales comparable to the period of collapse at free fall velocities. After the density of infalling material has reached about 10−8 g / cm3, that material is sufficiently transparent to allow energy radiated by the protostar to escape. The combination of convection within the protostar and radiation from its exterior allow the star to contract further. This continues until the gas is hot enough for the internal pressure to support the protostar against further gravitational collapse—a state called hydrostatic equilibrium. When this accretion phase is nearly complete, the resulting object is known as a protostar.

Accretion of material onto the protostar continues partially from the newly formed circumstellar disc. When the density and temperature are high enough, deuterium fusion begins, and the outward pressure of the resultant radiation slows (but does not stop) the collapse. Material comprising the cloud continues to &quot;rain&quot; onto the protostar. In this stage bipolar jets are produced called Herbig–Haro objects. This is probably the means by which excess angular momentum of the infalling material is expelled, allowing the star to continue to form.

When the surrounding gas and dust envelope disperses and accretion process stops, the star is considered a pre-main-sequence star (PMS star). The energy source of these objects is (gravitational contraction)Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism, as opposed to hydrogen burning in main sequence stars. The PMS star follows a Hayashi track on the Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R) diagram. The contraction will proceed until the Hayashi limit is reached, and thereafter contraction will continue on a Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale with the temperature remaining stable. Stars with less than thereafter join the main sequence. For more massive PMS stars, at the end of the Hayashi track they will slowly collapse in near hydrostatic equilibrium, following the Henyey track.

Finally, hydrogen begins to fuse in the core of the star, and the rest of the enveloping material is cleared away. This ends the protostellar phase and begins the star&#x27;s main sequence phase on the H–R diagram.

The stages of the process are well defined in stars with masses around or less. In high mass stars, the length of the star formation process is comparable to the other timescales of their evolution, much shorter, and the process is not so well defined. The later evolution of stars is studied in stellar evolution.
==Observations==

Key elements of star formation are only available by observing in wavelengths other than the optical. The protostellar stage of stellar existence is almost invariably hidden away deep inside dense clouds of gas and dust left over from the GMC. Often, these star-forming cocoons known as Bok globules, can be seen in silhouette against bright emission from surrounding gas. Early stages of a star&#x27;s life can be seen in infrared light, which penetrates the dust more easily than visible light. 
Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have thus been especially important for unveiling numerous galactic protostars and their parent star clusters. Examples of such embedded star clusters are FSR 1184, FSR 1190, Camargo 14, Camargo 74, Majaess 64, and Majaess 98.

The structure of the molecular cloud and the effects of the protostar can be observed in near-IR extinction maps (where the number of stars are counted per unit area and compared to a nearby zero extinction area of sky), continuum dust emission and rotational transitions of CO and other molecules; these last two are observed in the millimeter and submillimeter range. The radiation from the protostar and early star has to be observed in infrared astronomy wavelengths, as the extinction caused by the rest of the cloud in which the star is forming is usually too big to allow us to observe it in the visual part of the spectrum. This presents considerable difficulties as the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is almost entirely opaque from 20μm to 850μm, with narrow windows at 200μm and 450μm. Even outside this range, atmospheric subtraction techniques must be used.
X-ray observations have proven useful for studying young stars, since X-ray emission from these objects is about 100–100,000 times stronger than X-ray emission from main-sequence stars. The earliest detections of X-rays from T Tauri stars were made by the Einstein X-ray Observatory. For low-mass stars X-rays are generated by the heating of the stellar corona through magnetic reconnection, while for high-mass O and early B-type stars X-rays are generated through supersonic shocks in the stellar winds. Photons in the soft X-ray energy range covered by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton may penetrate the interstellar medium with only moderate absorption due to gas, making the X-ray a useful wavelength for seeing the stellar populations within molecular clouds. X-ray emission as evidence of stellar youth makes this band particularly useful for performing censuses of stars in star-forming regions, given that not all young stars have infrared excesses. X-ray observations have provided near-complete censuses of all stellar-mass objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster and Taurus Molecular Cloud.

The formation of individual stars can only be directly observed in the Milky Way Galaxy, but in distant galaxies star formation has been detected through its unique spectral signature.

Initial research indicates star-forming clumps start as giant, dense areas in turbulent gas-rich matter in young galaxies, live about 500 million years, and may migrate to the center of a galaxy, creating the central bulge of a galaxy.

On February 21, 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.

In February 2018, astronomers reported, for the first time, a signal of the reionization epoch, an indirect detection of light from the earliest stars formed - about 180 million years after the Big Bang.

An article published on October 22, 2019, reported on the detection of 3MM-1, a massive star-forming galaxy about 12.5 billion light-years away that is obscured by clouds of dust. At a mass of about 1010.8 solar masses, it showed a star formation rate about 100 times as high as in the Milky Way.

===Notable pathfinder objects===
*MWC 349 was first discovered in 1978, and is estimated to be only 1,000 years old.
*VLA 1623 – The first exemplar Class 0 protostar, a type of embedded protostar that has yet to accrete the majority of its mass. Found in 1993, is possibly younger than 10,000 years.
*L1014 – An extremely faint embedded object representative of a new class of sources that are only now being detected with the newest telescopes. Their status is still undetermined, they could be the youngest low-mass Class 0 protostars yet seen or even very low-mass evolved objects (like brown dwarfs or even rogue planets).
*GCIRS 8* – The youngest known main sequence star in the Galactic Center region, discovered in August 2006. It is estimated to be 3.5 million years old.

==Low mass and high mass star formation==

Stars of different masses are thought to form by slightly different mechanisms. The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well-supported by observation, suggests that low-mass stars form by the gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds. As described above, the collapse of a rotating cloud of gas and dust leads to the formation of an accretion disk through which matter is channeled onto a central protostar. For stars with masses higher than about , however, the mechanism of star formation is not well understood.

Massive stars emit copious quantities of radiation which pushes against infalling material. In the past, it was thought that this radiation pressure might be substantial enough to halt accretion onto the massive protostar and prevent the formation of stars with masses more than a few tens of solar masses. Recent theoretical work has shown that the production of a jet and outflow clears a cavity through which much of the radiation from a massive protostar can escape without hindering accretion through the disk and onto the protostar. Present thinking is that massive stars may therefore be able to form by a mechanism similar to that by which low mass stars form.

There is mounting evidence that at least some massive protostars are indeed surrounded by accretion disks. Disk accretion in high-mass protostars, similar to their low-mass counterparts, is expected to exhibit bursts of episodic accretion as a result of a gravitationally instability leading to clumpy and in-continuous accretion rates. Recent evidence of accretion bursts in high-mass protostars has indeed been confirmed observationally. Several other theories of massive star formation remain to be tested observationally. Of these, perhaps the most prominent is the theory of competitive accretion, which suggests that massive protostars are &quot;seeded&quot; by low-mass protostars which compete with other protostars to draw in matter from the entire parent molecular cloud, instead of simply from a small local region.

Another theory of massive star formation suggests that massive stars may form by the coalescence of two or more stars of lower mass.

==Filamentary nature of star formation==

Recent studies have emphasized the role of filamentary structures in molecular clouds as the initial conditions for star formation. Findings from the Herschel Space Observatory highlight the ubiquitous nature of these filaments in the cold interstellar medium (ISM). The spatial relationship between cores and filaments indicates that the majority of prestellar cores are located within 0.1 pc of supercritical filaments. This supports the hypothesis that filamentary structures act as pathways for the accumulation of gas and dust, leading to core formation.

Both the core mass function (CMF) and filament line mass function (FLMF) observed in the California GMC follow power-law distributions at the high-mass end, consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function (IMF). Current results strongly support the existence of a connection between the FLMF and the CMF/IMF, demonstrating that this connection holds at the level of an individual cloud, specifically the California GMC. The FLMF presented is a distribution of local line masses for a complete, homogeneous sample of filaments within the same cloud. It is the local line mass of a filament that defines its ability to fragment at a particular location along its spine, not the average line mass of the filament. This connection is more direct and provides tighter constraints on the origin of the CMF/IMF.

<doc id="43949" wikidata="Q582687" url="?curid=43949" title="Antipyretic">
<text>An antipyretic (, from &quot;anti-&quot; &#x27;against&#x27; and &quot;&quot; &#x27;feverish&#x27;) is a substance that reduces fever. Antipyretics cause the hypothalamus to override a prostaglandin-induced increase in temperature. The body then works to lower the temperature, which results in a reduction in fever.

Most antipyretic medications have other purposes. The most common antipyretics in the US are usually ibuprofen and aspirin, which are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used primarily as anti-inflammatories and analgesics (pain relievers), but which also have antipyretic properties; and paracetamol (acetaminophen), an analgesic without anti-inflammatory properties.

There is some debate over the appropriate use of such medications, since fever is part of the body&#x27;s immune response to infection. A study published by the Royal Society claims that fever suppression causes at least 1% more influenza deaths in the United States, or 700 extra deaths per year.

==Non-pharmacological treatment==
Bathing or sponging with lukewarm or cool water can effectively reduce body temperature in those with heat illness, but not usually in those with fever. The use of alcohol baths is not an appropriate cooling method, because there have been reported adverse events associated with systemic absorption of alcohol.

==Medications==
The list of medications with antipyretic effects includes many common drugs that also have analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity, several of which are commonly sold over-the-counter (OTC).

* NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), a broad class of medications that in addition to their defining effect of reducing inflammation, also tend to be potent analgesics and antipyretics. The majority work by inhibiting the activity of the cyclooxygenase (COX) family of enzymes in the body.
** Nonselective COX enzyme inhibitors like ibuprofen and naproxen.
** Salicylates, including aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), magnesium salicylate, and sodium salicylate. These are also primarily nonselective COX inhibitors, but also work through other mechanisms including activating AMP-activated protein kinase.
** COX inhibitors that are relatively selective for the COX-1 enzyme, such as ketoprofen and flurbiprofen.
** Conversely, COX inhibitors that are relatively selective for COX-2, including nimesulide, diclofenac and celecoxib.
** Phenazone-like drugs (pyrazolones), many of which have been largely phased out of used owing to safety concerns in most countries (including metamizole, banned in over 30 countries for causing agranulocytosis), but remain available in some locations or for specific purposes such as for treating otitis media in the form of ear drops.
* Paracetamol (acetaminophen) class antipyretics, which have negligible anti-inflammatory activity. Apart from paracetamol itself, the medications in this class are mainly previously marketed drugs which were withdrawn owing to safety concerns, one example of this being phenacetin.
* A few other medications have antipyretic effects of varying strength. While these medications tend to have too weak fever reducing effects or too many adverse effects to use primarily as antipyretics, their antipyretic effect may occasionally be useful. For example, there are theoretical reasons to believe, as well as slight evidence from one human trial, that α2-adrenergic agonists, and particularly clonidine (a common drug used to treat high blood pressure, ADHD, spasticity and several other conditions), may have antipyretic effects, which if verified could potentially be useful in patients with septic shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

===Use in children===
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notes that improper dosing is one of the biggest problems in giving acetaminophen (paracetamol) to children. The effectiveness of acetaminophen alone as an antipyretic in children is uncertain, with some evidence showing it is no better than physical methods. Therapies involving alternating doses of acetaminophen and ibuprofen have shown greater antipyretic effect than either drug alone. One meta-analysis indicated that ibuprofen is more effective than acetaminophen in children at similar doses when both are given alone.

Due to concerns about Reye syndrome, it is recommended that aspirin and combination products that contain aspirin not be given to children or teenagers during episodes of fever-causing illnesses.

==Traditional medicine==
Traditional use of vascular plants with antipyretic properties is a common worldwide feature of many ethnobotanical cultures. In ethnobotany, a plant with naturally occurring antipyretic properties is commonly referred to as a &quot;febrifuge&quot;.

<text>The Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, commonly known as the Interstate Highway System, or the Eisenhower Interstate System, is a network of controlled-access highways that forms part of the National Highway System in the United States. The system extends throughout the contiguous United States and has routes in Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico.

In the 20th century, the United States Congress began funding roadways through the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916, and started an effort to construct a national road grid with the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. In 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was established, creating the first national road numbering system for cross-country travel. The roads were funded and maintained by U.S. states, and there were few national standards for road design. United States Numbered Highways ranged from two-lane country roads to multi-lane freeways. After Dwight D. Eisenhower became president in 1953, his administration developed a proposal for an interstate highway system, eventually resulting in the enactment of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956.

Unlike the earlier United States Numbered Highway System, the interstates were designed to be all freeways, with nationally unified standards for construction and signage. While some older freeways were adopted into the system, most of the routes were completely new. In dense urban areas, the choice of routing destroyed many well-established neighborhoods, often intentionally as part of a program of &quot;urban renewal&quot;. In the two decades following the 1956 Highway Act, the construction of the freeways displaced one million people, and as a result of the many freeway revolts during this era, several planned Interstates were abandoned or re-routed to avoid urban cores.

Construction of the original Interstate Highway System was proclaimed complete in 1992, despite deviations from the original 1956 plan and several stretches that did not fully conform with federal standards. The construction of the Interstate Highway System cost approximately $114 billion (equivalent to $ in ). The system has continued to expand and grow as additional federal funding has provided for new routes to be added, and many future Interstate Highways are currently either being planned or under construction.

Though heavily funded by the federal government, Interstate Highways are owned by the state in which they were built. With few exceptions, all Interstates must meet specific standards, such as having controlled access, physical barriers or median strips between lanes of oncoming traffic, breakdown lanes, avoiding at-grade intersections, no traffic lights, and complying with federal traffic sign specifications. Interstate Highways use a numbering scheme in which primary Interstates are assigned one- or two-digit numbers, and shorter routes which branch off from longer ones are assigned three-digit numbers where the last two digits match the parent route. The Interstate Highway System is partially financed through the Highway Trust Fund, which itself is funded by a combination of a federal fuel tax and transfers from the Treasury&#x27;s general fund. Though federal legislation initially banned the collection of tolls, some Interstate routes are toll roads, either because they were grandfathered into the system or because subsequent legislation has allowed for tolling of Interstates in some cases.

, about one quarter of all vehicle miles driven in the country used the Interstate Highway System, which has a total length of . In 2022 and 2023, the number of fatalities on the Interstate Highway System amounted to more than 5,000 people annually, with nearly 5,600 fatalities in 2022.

==History==

===Planning===


The United States government&#x27;s efforts to construct a national network of highways began on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis with the passage of the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916, which provided $75 million over a five-year period for matching funds to the states for the construction and improvement of highways. The nation&#x27;s revenue needs associated with World War I prevented any significant implementation of this policy, which expired in 1921.

In December 1918, E. J. Mehren, a civil engineer and the editor of &quot;Engineering News-Record&quot;, presented his &quot;A Suggested National Highway Policy and Plan&quot; during a gathering of the State Highway Officials and Highway Industries Association at the Congress Hotel in Chicago. In the plan, Mehren proposed a system, consisting of five east–west routes and 10 north–south routes. The system would include two percent of all roads and would pass through every state at a cost of , providing commercial as well as military transport benefits.

In 1919, the US Army sent an expedition across the US to determine the difficulties that military vehicles would have on a cross-country trip. Leaving from the Ellipse near the White House on July 7, the Motor Transport Corps convoy needed 62 days to drive on the Lincoln Highway to the Presidio of San Francisco along the Golden Gate. The convoy suffered many setbacks and problems on the route, such as poor-quality bridges, broken crankshafts, and engines clogged with desert sand.

Dwight Eisenhower, then a 28-year-old brevet lieutenant colonel, accompanied the trip &quot;through darkest America with truck and tank,&quot; as he later described it. Some roads in the West were a &quot;succession of dust, ruts, pits, and holes.&quot;

As the landmark 1916 law expired, new legislation was passed—the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act). This new road construction initiative once again provided for federal matching funds for road construction and improvement, $75 million allocated annually. Moreover, this new legislation for the first time sought to target these funds to the construction of a national road grid of interconnected &quot;primary highways&quot;, setting up cooperation among the various state highway planning boards.

The Bureau of Public Roads asked the Army to provide a list of roads that it considered necessary for national defense. In 1922, General John J. Pershing, former head of the American Expeditionary Force in Europe during the war, complied by submitting a detailed network of of interconnected primary highways—the so-called Pershing Map.

A boom in road construction followed throughout the decade of the 1920s, with such projects as the New York parkway system constructed as part of a new national highway system. As automobile traffic increased, planners saw a need for such an interconnected national system to supplement the existing, largely non-freeway, United States Numbered Highways system. By the late 1930s, planning had expanded to a system of new superhighways.
In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave Thomas MacDonald, chief at the Bureau of Public Roads, a hand-drawn map of the United States marked with eight superhighway corridors for study. In 1939, Bureau of Public Roads Division of Information chief Herbert S. Fairbank wrote a report called &quot;Toll Roads and Free Roads&quot;, &quot;the first formal description of what became the Interstate Highway System&quot; and, in 1944, the similarly themed &quot;Interregional Highways&quot;.

===Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956===
The Interstate Highway System gained a champion in President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was influenced by his experiences as a young Army officer crossing the country in the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy that drove in part on the Lincoln Highway, the first road across America. He recalled that, &quot;The old convoy had started me thinking about good two-lane highways... the wisdom of broader ribbons across our land.&quot; Eisenhower also gained an appreciation of the Reichsautobahn system, the first &quot;national&quot; implementation of modern Germany&#x27;s Autobahn network, as a necessary component of a national defense system while he was serving as Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe during World War II. In 1954, Eisenhower appointed General Lucius D. Clay to head a committee charged with proposing an interstate highway system plan. Summing up motivations for the construction of such a system, Clay stated,

Clay&#x27;s committee proposed a 10-year, $100 billion program , which would build of divided highways linking all American cities with a population of greater than 50,000. Eisenhower initially preferred a system consisting of toll roads, but Clay convinced Eisenhower that toll roads were not feasible outside of the highly populated coastal regions. In February 1955, Eisenhower forwarded Clay&#x27;s proposal to Congress. The bill quickly won approval in the Senate, but House Democrats objected to the use of public bonds as the means to finance construction. Eisenhower and the House Democrats agreed to instead finance the system through the Highway Trust Fund, which itself would be funded by a gasoline tax. In June 1956, Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 into law. Under the act, the federal government would pay for 90 percent of the cost of construction of Interstate Highways. Each Interstate Highway was required to be a freeway with at least four lanes and no at-grade crossings.

The publication in 1955 of the &quot;General Location of National System of Interstate Highways&quot;, informally known as the &quot;Yellow Book&quot;, mapped out what became the Interstate Highway System. Assisting in the planning was Charles Erwin Wilson, who was still head of General Motors when President Eisenhower selected him as Secretary of Defense in January 1953.

===Construction===

Some sections of highways that became part of the Interstate Highway System actually began construction earlier.

Three states have claimed the title of first Interstate Highway. Missouri claims that the first three contracts under the new program were signed in Missouri on August 2, 1956. The first contract signed was for upgrading a section of US Route 66 to what is now designated Interstate 44. On August 13, 1956, work began on US 40 (now I-70) in St. Charles County.

Kansas claims that it was the first to start paving after the act was signed. Preliminary construction had taken place before the act was signed, and paving started September 26, 1956. The state marked its portion of I-70 as the first project in the United States completed under the provisions of the new Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956.

The Pennsylvania Turnpike could also be considered one of the first Interstate Highways, and is nicknamed &quot;Grandfather of the Interstate System&quot;. On October 1, 1940, of the highway now designated I‑70 and I‑76 opened between Irwin and Carlisle. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania refers to the turnpike as the Granddaddy of the Pikes, a reference to turnpikes.

Milestones in the construction of the Interstate Highway System include:
* October 17, 1974: Nebraska becomes the first state to complete all of its mainline Interstate Highways with the dedication of its final piece of I-80.
* October 12, 1979: The final section of the Canada to Mexico freeway Interstate 5 is dedicated near Stockton, California. Representatives of the two neighboring nations attended the dedication to commemorate the first contiguous freeway connecting the North American countries.
* August 22, 1986: The final section of the coast-to-coast I-80 (San Francisco, California, to Teaneck, New Jersey) is dedicated on the western edge of Salt Lake City, Utah, making I-80 the world&#x27;s first contiguous freeway to span from the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean and, at the time, the longest contiguous freeway in the world. The section spanned from Redwood Road to just west of the Salt Lake City International Airport. At the dedication it was noted that coincidentally this was only from Promontory Summit, where a similar feat was accomplished nearly 120 years prior, the driving of the golden spike of the United States&#x27; First transcontinental railroad.
* August 10, 1990: The final section of coast-to-coast I-10 (Santa Monica, California, to Jacksonville, Florida) is dedicated, the Papago Freeway Tunnel under downtown Phoenix, Arizona. Completion of this section was delayed due to a freeway revolt that forced the cancellation of an originally planned elevated routing.
* September 12, 1991: I-90 becomes the final coast-to-coast Interstate Highway (Seattle, Washington to Boston, Massachusetts) to be completed with the dedication of an elevated viaduct bypassing Wallace, Idaho, which opened a week earlier. This section was delayed after residents forced the cancellation of the originally planned at-grade alignment that would have demolished much of downtown Wallace. The residents accomplished this feat by arranging for most of the downtown area to be declared a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places; this succeeded in blocking the path of the original alignment. Two days after the dedication residents held a mock funeral celebrating the removal of the last stoplight on a transcontinental Interstate Highway.
* October 14, 1992: The original Interstate Highway System is proclaimed to be complete with the opening of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon in Colorado. This section is considered an engineering marvel with a span featuring 40 bridges and numerous tunnels and is one of the most expensive rural highways per mile built in the United States.

The initial cost estimate for the system was $25 billion over 12 years; it ended up costing $114 billion (equivalent to $425 billion in 2006 or $ in ) and took 35 years.

===1992–present===

====Discontinuities====

The system was proclaimed complete in 1992, but two of the original Interstates—I-95 and I-70—were not continuous: both of these discontinuities were due to local opposition, which blocked efforts to build the necessary connections to fully complete the system. I-95 was made a continuous freeway in 2018, and thus I-70 remains the only original Interstate with a discontinuity.

I-95 was discontinuous in New Jersey because of the cancellation of the Somerset Freeway. This situation was remedied when the construction of the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project started in 2010 and partially opened on September 22, 2018, which was already enough to fill the gap.

However, I-70 remains discontinuous in Pennsylvania, because of the lack of a direct interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike at the eastern end of the concurrency near Breezewood. Traveling in either direction, I-70 traffic must exit the freeway and use a short stretch of US 30 (which includes a number of roadside services) to rejoin I-70. The interchange was not originally built because of a legacy federal funding rule, since relaxed, which restricted the use of federal funds to improve roads financed with tolls. Solutions have been proposed to eliminate the discontinuity, but they have been blocked by local opposition, fearing a loss of business.

====Expansions and removals====

The Interstate Highway System has been expanded numerous times. The expansions have both created new designations and extended existing designations. For example, I-49, added to the system in the 1980s as a freeway in Louisiana, was designated as an expansion corridor, and FHWA approved the expanded route north from Lafayette, Louisiana, to Kansas City, Missouri. The freeway exists today as separate completed segments, with segments under construction or in the planning phase between them.

In 1966, the FHWA designated the entire Interstate Highway System as part of the larger Pan-American Highway System, and at least two proposed Interstate expansions were initiated to help trade with Canada and Mexico spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Long-term plans for I-69, which currently exists in several separate completed segments (the largest of which are in Indiana and Texas), is to have the highway route extend from Tamaulipas, Mexico to Ontario, Canada. The planned I-11 will then bridge the Interstate gap between Phoenix, Arizona and Las Vegas, Nevada, and thus form part of the CANAMEX Corridor (along with I-19, and portions of I-10 and I-15) between Sonora, Mexico and Alberta, Canada.

===Opposition, cancellations, and removals===

Political opposition from residents canceled many freeway projects around the United States, including:
* I-40 in Memphis, Tennessee was rerouted and part of the original I-40 is still in use as the eastern half of Sam Cooper Boulevard.
* I-66 in the District of Columbia was abandoned in 1977.
* I-69 was to continue past its terminus at Interstate 465 to intersect with Interstate 70 and Interstate 65 at the north split, northeast of downtown Indianapolis. Though local opposition led to the cancellation of this project in 1981, bridges and ramps for the connection into the &quot;north split&quot; remained until it was rebuilt in 2023.
* I-70 in Baltimore was supposed to run from the Baltimore Beltway (Interstate 695), which surrounds the city to terminate at I-95, the East Coast thoroughfare that runs through Maryland and Baltimore on a diagonal course, northeast to southwest; the connection was cancelled on the mid-1970s due to its routing through Gwynns Falls-Leakin Park, a wilderness urban park reserve following the Gwynns Falls stream through West Baltimore. This included the cancellation of I-170, partially built and in use as US 40, and nicknamed the Highway to Nowhere. The freeway stub of I-70 inside the Beltway was renumbered MD 570 in 2014, but continues to bear I-70 signs.
* I-78 in New York City was canceled along with portions of I-278, I-478, and I-878. I-878 was supposed to be part of I-78, and I-478 and I-278 were to be spur routes.
* I-80 in San Francisco was originally planned to travel past the city&#x27;s Civic Center along the Panhandle Freeway into Golden Gate Park and terminate at the original alignment of I-280/SR 1. The city canceled this and several other freeways in 1958. Similarly, more than 20 years later, Sacramento canceled plans to upgrade I-80 to Interstate Standards and rerouted the freeway on what was then I-880 that traveled north of Downtown Sacramento.
* I-83, southern extension of the Jones Falls Expressway (southern I-83) in Baltimore was supposed to run along the waterfront of the Patapsco River / Baltimore Harbor to connect to I-95, bisecting historic neighborhoods of Fells Point and Canton, but the connection was never built.
* I-84 in Connecticut was once planned to fork east of Hartford, into an I-86 to Sturbridge, Massachusetts, and I-84 to Providence, R.I. The plan was cancelled, primarily because of anticipated impact on a major Rhode Island reservoir. The I-84 designation was restored to the highway to Sturbridge, and other numbering was used for completed Eastern sections of what had been planned as part of I-84.
* I-95 through the District of Columbia into Maryland was abandoned in 1977. Instead it was rerouted to I-495 (Capital Beltway). The completed section is now I-395.
* I-95 was originally planned to run up the Southwest Expressway and meet I-93, where the two highways would travel along the Central Artery through downtown Boston, but was rerouted onto the Route 128 beltway due to widespread opposition. This revolt also included the cancellation of the Inner Belt, connecting I-93 to I-90 and a cancelled section of the Northwest Expressway which would have carried US 3 inside the Route 128 beltway, meeting with Route 2 in Cambridge.

In addition to cancellations, removals of freeways are planned:
* I-81 in Syracuse, New York, which bisects the city&#x27;s 15th Ward neighborhood, is planned to be torn down and replaced with a boulevard that accommodates pedestrians. Freeway traffic would be rerouted along I-481.

==Standards==

The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) has defined a set of standards that all new Interstates must meet unless a waiver from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is obtained. One almost absolute standard is the controlled access nature of the roads. With few exceptions, traffic lights (and cross traffic in general) are limited to toll booths and ramp meters (metered flow control for lane merging during rush hour).

===Speed limits===

Being freeways, Interstate Highways usually have the highest speed limits in a given area. Speed limits are determined by individual states. From 1975 to 1986, the maximum speed limit on any highway in the United States was , in accordance with federal law.

Typically, lower limits are established in Northeastern and coastal states, while higher speed limits are established in inland states west of the Mississippi River. For example, the maximum speed limit is in northern Maine, varies between from southern Maine to New Jersey, and is in New York City and the District of Columbia. Currently, rural speed limits elsewhere generally range from . Several portions of various highways such as I-10 and I-20 in rural western Texas, I-80 in Nevada between Fernley and Winnemucca (except around Lovelock) and portions of I-15, I-70, I-80, and I-84 in Utah have a speed limit of . Other Interstates in Idaho, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming also have the same high speed limits.

In some areas, speed limits on Interstates can be significantly lower in areas where they traverse significantly hazardous areas. The maximum speed limit on I-90 is in downtown Cleveland because of two sharp curves with a suggested limit of in a heavily congested area; I-70 through Wheeling, West Virginia, has a maximum speed limit of through the Wheeling Tunnel and most of downtown Wheeling; and I-68 has a maximum speed limit of through Cumberland, Maryland, because of multiple hazards including sharp curves and narrow lanes through the city. In some locations, low speed limits are the result of lawsuits and resident demands; after holding up the completion of I-35E in St. Paul, Minnesota, for nearly 30 years in the courts, residents along the stretch of the freeway from the southern city limit to downtown successfully lobbied for a speed limit in addition to a prohibition on any vehicle weighing more than gross vehicle weight. I-93 in Franconia Notch State Park in northern New Hampshire has a speed limit of because it is a parkway that consists of only one lane per side of the highway. On the other hand, Interstates 15, 80, 84, and 215 in Utah have speed limits as high as within the Wasatch Front, Cedar City, and St. George areas, and I-25 in New Mexico within the Santa Fe and Las Vegas areas along with I-20 in Texas along Odessa and Midland and I-29 in North Dakota along the Grand Forks area have higher speed limits of .

===Other uses===
As one of the components of the National Highway System, Interstate Highways improve the mobility of military troops to and from airports, seaports, rail terminals, and other military bases. Interstate Highways also connect to other roads that are a part of the Strategic Highway Network, a system of roads identified as critical to the US Department of Defense.

The system has also been used to facilitate evacuations in the face of hurricanes and other natural disasters. An option for maximizing traffic throughput on a highway is to reverse the flow of traffic on one side of a divider so that all lanes become outbound lanes. This procedure, known as contraflow lane reversal, has been employed several times for hurricane evacuations. After public outcry regarding the inefficiency of evacuating from southern Louisiana prior to Hurricane Georges&#x27; landfall in September 1998, government officials looked towards contraflow to improve evacuation times. In Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, in 1999, lanes of I-16 and I-26 were used in a contraflow configuration in anticipation of Hurricane Floyd with mixed results.

In 2004, contraflow was employed ahead of Hurricane Charley in the Tampa, Florida area and on the Gulf Coast before the landfall of Hurricane Ivan; however, evacuation times there were no better than previous evacuation operations. Engineers began to apply lessons learned from the analysis of prior contraflow operations, including limiting exits, removing troopers (to keep traffic flowing instead of having drivers stop for directions), and improving the dissemination of public information. As a result, the 2005 evacuation of New Orleans, Louisiana, prior to Hurricane Katrina ran much more smoothly.

According to urban legend, early regulations required that one out of every five miles of the Interstate Highway System must be built straight and flat, so as to be usable by aircraft during times of war. There is no evidence of this rule being included in any Interstate legislation. It is also commonly believed the Interstate Highway System was built for the sole purpose of evacuating cities in the event of nuclear warfare. While military motivations were present, the primary motivations were civilian.

==Numbering system==
===Primary (one- and two-digit) Interstates===

The numbering scheme for the Interstate Highway System was developed in 1957 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The association&#x27;s present numbering policy dates back to August 10, 1973. Within the contiguous United States, primary Interstates—also called main line Interstates or two-digit Interstates—are assigned numbers less than 100.

While numerous exceptions do exist, there is a general scheme for numbering Interstates. Primary Interstates are assigned one- or two-digit numbers, while shorter routes (such as spurs, loops, and short connecting roads) are assigned three-digit numbers where the last two digits match the parent route (thus, I-294 is a loop that connects at both ends to I-94, while I-787 is a short spur route attached to I-87). In the numbering scheme for the primary routes, east–west highways are assigned even numbers and north–south highways are assigned odd numbers. Odd route numbers increase from west to east, and even-numbered routes increase from south to north (to avoid confusion with the US Highways, which increase from east to west and north to south). This numbering system usually holds true even if the local direction of the route does not match the compass directions. Numbers divisible by five are intended to be major arteries among the primary routes, carrying traffic long distances. Primary north–south Interstates increase in number from I-5 between Canada and Mexico along the West Coast to I‑95 between Canada and Miami, Florida along the East Coast. Major west–east arterial Interstates increase in number from I-10 between Santa Monica, California, and Jacksonville, Florida, to I-90 between Seattle, Washington, and Boston, Massachusetts, with two exceptions. There are no I-50 and I-60, as routes with those numbers would likely pass through states that currently have US Highways with the same numbers, which is generally disallowed under highway administration guidelines.

Several two-digit numbers are shared between unconnected road segments at opposite ends of the country for various reasons. Some such highways are incomplete Interstates (such as I-69 and I-74) and some just happen to share route designations (such as I-76, I-84, I‑86, I-87, and I-88). Some of these were due to a change in the numbering system as a result of a new policy adopted in 1973. Previously, letter-suffixed numbers were used for long spurs off primary routes; for example, western I‑84 was I‑80N, as it went north from I‑80. The new policy stated, &quot;No new divided numbers (such as I-35W and I-35E, etc.) shall be adopted.&quot; The new policy also recommended that existing divided numbers be eliminated as quickly as possible; however, an I-35W and I-35E still exist in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex in Texas, and an I-35W and I-35E that run through Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota, still exist. Additionally, due to Congressional requirements, three sections of I-69 in southern Texas will be divided into I-69W, I-69E, and I-69C (for Central).

AASHTO policy allows dual numbering to provide continuity between major control points. This is referred to as a concurrency or overlap. For example, I‑75 and I‑85 share the same roadway in Atlanta; this section, called the Downtown Connector, is labeled both I‑75 and I‑85. Concurrencies between Interstate and US Highway numbers are also allowed in accordance with AASHTO policy, as long as the length of the concurrency is reasonable. In rare instances, two highway designations sharing the same roadway are signed as traveling in opposite directions; one such wrong-way concurrency is found between Wytheville and Fort Chiswell, Virginia, where I‑81 north and I‑77 south are equivalent (with that section of road traveling almost due east), as are I‑81 south and I‑77 north.

===Auxiliary (three-digit) Interstates===

Auxiliary Interstate Highways are circumferential, radial, or spur highways that principally serve urban areas. These types of Interstate Highways are given three-digit route numbers, which consist of a single digit prefixed to the two-digit number of its parent Interstate Highway. Spur routes deviate from their parent and do not return; these are given an odd first digit. Circumferential and radial loop routes return to the parent, and are given an even first digit. Unlike primary Interstates, three-digit Interstates are signed as either east–west or north–south, depending on the general orientation of the route, without regard to the route number. For instance, I-190 in Massachusetts is labeled north–south, while I-195 in New Jersey is labeled east–west. Some looped Interstate routes use inner–outer directions instead of compass directions, when the use of compass directions would create ambiguity. Due to the large number of these routes, auxiliary route numbers may be repeated in different states along the mainline. Some auxiliary highways do not follow these guidelines, however.

===Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico===

The Interstate Highway System also extends to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, even though they have no direct land connections to any other states or territories. However, their residents still pay federal fuel and tire taxes.

The Interstates in Hawaii, all located on the most populous island of Oahu, carry the prefix H. There are three one-digit routes in the state (H-1, H-2, and H-3) and one auxiliary route (H-201). These Interstates connect several military and naval bases together, as well as the important communities spread across Oahu, and especially within the urban core of Honolulu.

Both Alaska and Puerto Rico also have public highways that receive 90 percent of their funding from the Interstate Highway program. The Interstates of Alaska and Puerto Rico are numbered sequentially in order of funding without regard to the rules on odd and even numbers. They also carry the prefixes A and PR, respectively. However, these highways are signed according to their local designations, not their Interstate Highway numbers. Furthermore, these routes were neither planned according to nor constructed to the official Interstate Highway standards.

===Mile markers and exit numbers===
On one- or two-digit Interstates, the mile marker numbering almost always begins at the southern or western state line. If an Interstate originates within a state, the numbering begins from the location where the road begins in the south or west. As with all guidelines for Interstate routes, however, numerous exceptions exist.

Three-digit Interstates with an even first number that form a complete circumferential (circle) bypass around a city feature mile markers that are numbered in a clockwise direction, beginning just west of an Interstate that bisects the circumferential route near a south polar location. In other words, mile marker 1 on I-465, a route around Indianapolis, is just west of its junction with I-65 on the south side of Indianapolis (on the south leg of I-465), and mile marker 53 is just east of this same junction. An exception is I-495 in the Washington metropolitan area, with mileposts increasing counterclockwise because part of that road is also part of I-95.

Most Interstate Highways use distance-based exit numbers so that the exit number is the same as the nearest mile marker. If multiple exits occur within the same mile, letter suffixes may be appended to the numbers in alphabetical order starting with A. A small number of Interstate Highways (mostly in the Northeastern United States) use sequential-based exit numbering schemes (where each exit is numbered in order starting with 1, without regard for the mile markers on the road). One Interstate Highway, I-19 in Arizona, is signed with kilometer-based exit numbers. In the state of New York, most Interstate Highways use sequential exit numbering, with some exceptions.

===Business routes===

AASHTO defines a category of special routes separate from primary and auxiliary Interstate designations. These routes do not have to comply to Interstate construction or limited-access standards but are routes that may be identified and approved by the association. The same route marking policy applies to both US Numbered Highways and Interstate Highways; however, business route designations are sometimes used for Interstate Highways. Known as Business Loops and Business Spurs, these routes principally travel through the corporate limits of a city, passing through the central business district when the regular route is directed around the city. They also use a green shield instead of the red and blue shield. An example would be Business Loop Interstate 75 at Pontiac, Michigan, which follows surface roads into and through downtown. Sections of BL I-75&#x27;s routing had been part of US 10 and M-24, predecessors of I-75 in the area.

==Financing==
Interstate Highways and their rights-of-way are owned by the state in which they were built. The last federally owned portion of the Interstate System was the Woodrow Wilson Bridge on the Washington Capital Beltway. The new bridge was completed in 2009 and is collectively owned by Virginia and Maryland. Maintenance is generally the responsibility of the state department of transportation. However, there are some segments of Interstate owned and maintained by local authorities.

===Taxes and user fees===

About 70 percent of the construction and maintenance costs of Interstate Highways in the United States have been paid through user fees, primarily the fuel taxes collected by the federal, state, and local governments. To a much lesser extent they have been paid for by tolls collected on toll highways and bridges. The federal gasoline tax was first imposed in 1932 at one cent per gallon; during the Eisenhower administration, the Highway Trust Fund, established by the Highway Revenue Act in 1956, prescribed a three-cent-per-gallon fuel tax, soon increased to 4.5 cents per gallon. Since 1993 the tax has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon. Other excise taxes related to highway travel also accumulated in the Highway Trust Fund. Initially, that fund was sufficient for the federal portion of building the Interstate system, built in the early years with &quot;10 cent dollars&quot;, from the perspective of the states, as the federal government paid 90% of the costs while the state paid 10%. The system grew more rapidly than the rate of the taxes on fuel and other aspects of driving (e. g., excise tax on tires).

The rest of the costs of these highways are borne by general fund receipts, bond issues, designated property taxes, and other taxes. The federal contribution is funded primarily through fuel taxes and through transfers from the Treasury&#x27;s general fund. Local government contributions are overwhelmingly from sources besides user fees. As decades passed in the 20th century and into the 21st century, the portion of the user fees spent on highways themselves covers about 57 percent of their costs, with about one-sixth of the user fees being sent to other programs, including the mass transit systems in large cities. Some large sections of Interstate Highways that were planned or constructed before 1956 are still operated as toll roads, for example the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90), the New York State Thruway (I-87 and I-90), and Kansas Turnpike (I-35, I-335, I-470, I-70). Others have had their construction bonds paid off and they have become toll-free, such as the Connecticut Turnpike (I‑95, I-395), the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike in Virginia (also I‑95), and the Kentucky Turnpike (I‑65).
As American suburbs have expanded, the costs incurred in maintaining freeway infrastructure have also grown, leaving little in the way of funds for new Interstate construction. This has led to the proliferation of toll roads (turnpikes) as the new method of building limited-access highways in suburban areas. Some Interstates are privately maintained (for example, the VMS company maintains I‑35 in Texas) to meet rising costs of maintenance and allow state departments of transportation to focus on serving the fastest-growing regions in their states.

Parts of the Interstate System might have to be tolled in the future to meet maintenance and expansion demands, as has been done with adding toll HOV/HOT lanes in cities such as Atlanta, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Although part of the tolling is an effect of the SAFETEA‑LU act, which has put an emphasis on toll roads as a means to reduce congestion, present federal law does not allow for a state to change a freeway section to a tolled section for all traffic.

===Tolls===

About of toll roads are included in the Interstate Highway System. While federal legislation initially banned the collection of tolls on Interstates, many of the toll roads on the system were either completed or under construction when the Interstate Highway System was established. Since these highways provided logical connections to other parts of the system, they were designated as Interstate highways. Congress also decided that it was too costly to either build toll-free Interstates parallel to these toll roads, or directly repay all the bondholders who financed these facilities and remove the tolls. Thus, these toll roads were grandfathered into the Interstate Highway System.

Toll roads designated as Interstates (such as the Massachusetts Turnpike) were typically allowed to continue collecting tolls, but are generally ineligible to receive federal funds for maintenance and improvements. Some toll roads that did receive federal funds to finance emergency repairs (notably the Connecticut Turnpike (I-95) following the Mianus River Bridge collapse) were required to remove tolls as soon as the highway&#x27;s construction bonds were paid off. In addition, these toll facilities were grandfathered from Interstate Highway standards. A notable example is the western approach to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in Philadelphia, where I-676 has a surface street section through a historic area.

Policies on toll facilities and Interstate Highways have since changed. The Federal Highway Administration has allowed some states to collect tolls on existing Interstate Highways, while a recent extension of I-376 included a section of Pennsylvania Route 60 that was tolled by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission before receiving Interstate designation. Also, newer toll facilities (like the tolled section of I-376, which was built in the early 1990s) must conform to Interstate standards. A new addition of the &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; in 2009 requires a black-on-yellow &quot;Toll&quot; sign to be placed above the Interstate trailblazer on Interstate Highways that collect tolls.

Legislation passed in 2005 known as SAFETEA-LU, encouraged states to construct new Interstate Highways through &quot;innovative financing&quot; methods. SAFETEA-LU facilitated states to pursue innovative financing by easing the restrictions on building interstates as toll roads, either through state agencies or through public–private partnerships. However, SAFETEA-LU left in place a prohibition of installing tolls on existing toll-free Interstates, and states wishing to toll such routes to finance upgrades and repairs must first seek approval from Congress. Many states have started using High-occupancy toll lane and other partial tolling methods, whereby certain lanes of highly congested freeways are tolled, while others are left free, allowing people to pay a fee to travel in less congested lanes. Examples of recent projects to add HOT lanes to existing freeways include the Virginia HOT lanes on the Virginia portions of the Capital Beltway and other related interstate highways (I-95, I-495, I-395) and the addition of express toll lanes to Interstate 77 in North Carolina in the Charlotte metropolitan area.

===Chargeable and non-chargeable Interstate routes===
Interstate Highways financed with federal funds are known as &quot;chargeable&quot; Interstate routes, and are considered part of the network of highways. Federal laws also allow &quot;non-chargeable&quot; Interstate routes, highways funded similarly to state and US Highways to be signed as Interstates, if they both meet the Interstate Highway standards and are logical additions or connections to the system. These additions fall under two categories: routes that already meet Interstate standards, and routes not yet upgraded to Interstate standards. Only routes that meet Interstate standards may be signed as Interstates once their proposed number is approved.

==Signage==

===Interstate shield===
Interstate Highways are signed by a number placed on a red, white, and blue sign. The shield design itself is a registered trademark of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. The colors red, white, and blue were chosen because they are the colors of the American flag. In the original design, the name of the state was displayed above the highway number, but in many states, this area is now left blank, allowing for the printing of larger and more-legible digits. Signs with the shield alone are placed periodically throughout each Interstate as reassurance markers. These signs usually measure high, and are wide for two-digit Interstates or for three-digit Interstates.

Interstate business loops and spurs use a special shield in which the red and blue are replaced with green, the word &quot;BUSINESS&quot; appears instead of &quot;INTERSTATE&quot;, and the word &quot;SPUR&quot; or &quot;LOOP&quot; usually appears above the number. The green shield is employed to mark the main route through a city&#x27;s central business district, which intersects the associated Interstate at one (spur) or both (loop) ends of the business route. The route usually traverses the main thoroughfare(s) of the city&#x27;s downtown area or other major business district. A city may have more than one Interstate-derived business route, depending on the number of Interstates passing through a city and the number of significant business districts therein.

Over time, the design of the Interstate shield has changed. In 1957 the Interstate shield designed by Texas Highway Department employee Richard Oliver was introduced, the winner of a contest that included 100 entries; at the time, the shield color was a dark navy blue and only wide. The &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MUTCD) standards revised the shield in the 1961, 1971, and 1978 editions.

===Exit numbering===

The majority of Interstates have exit numbers. Like other highways, Interstates feature guide signs that list control cities to help direct drivers through interchanges and exits toward their desired destination. All traffic signs and lane markings on the Interstates are supposed to be designed in compliance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). There are, however, many local and regional variations in signage.

For many years, California was the only state that did not use an exit numbering system. It was granted an exemption in the 1950s due to having an already largely completed and signed highway system; placing exit number signage across the state was deemed too expensive. To control costs, California began to incorporate exit numbers on its freeways in 2002—Interstate, US, and state routes alike. Caltrans commonly installs exit number signage only when a freeway or interchange is built, reconstructed, retrofitted, or repaired, and it is usually tacked onto the top-right corner of an already existing sign. Newer signs along the freeways follow this practice as well. Most exits along California&#x27;s Interstates now have exit number signage, particularly in rural areas. California, however, still does not use mileposts, although a few exist for experiments or for special purposes. 

In 2010–2011, the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority posted all new mile markers to be uniform with the rest of the state on I‑90 (Jane Addams Memorial/Northwest Tollway) and the I‑94 section of the Tri‑State Tollway, which previously had matched the I‑294 section starting in the south at I‑80/I‑94/IL Route 394. This also applied to the tolled portion of the Ronald Reagan Tollway (I-88). The tollway also added exit number tabs to the exits.

Exit numbers correspond to Interstate mileage markers in most states. On I‑19 in Arizona, however, length is measured in kilometers instead of miles because, at the time of construction, a push for the United States to change to a metric system of measurement had gained enough traction that it was mistakenly assumed that all highway measurements would eventually be changed to metric (and some distance signs retain metric distances); proximity to metric-using Mexico may also have been a factor, as I‑19 indirectly connects I‑10 to the Mexican Federal Highway system via surface streets in Nogales. Mileage count increases from west to east on most even-numbered Interstates; on odd-numbered Interstates mileage count increases from south to north.

Some highways, including the New York State Thruway, use sequential exit-numbering schemes. Exits on the New York State Thruway count up from Yonkers traveling north, and then west from Albany. I‑87 in New York State is numbered in three sections. The first section makes up the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx, with interchanges numbered sequentially from 1 to 14. The second section of I‑87 is a part of the New York State Thruway that starts in Yonkers (exit 1) and continues north to Albany (exit 24); at Albany, the Thruway turns west and becomes I‑90 for exits 25 to 61. From Albany north to the Canadian border, the exits on I‑87 are numbered sequentially from 1 to 44 along the Adirondack Northway. This often leads to confusion as there is more than one exit on I‑87 with the same number. For example, exit 4 on Thruway section of I‑87 connects with the Cross County Parkway in Yonkers, but exit 4 on the Northway is the exit for the Albany airport. These two exits share a number but are located apart.

Many northeastern states label exit numbers sequentially, regardless of how many miles have passed between exits. States in which Interstate exits are still numbered sequentially are Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont; as such, three of the main Interstate Highways that remain completely within these states (87, 88, 89) have interchanges numbered sequentially along their entire routes. Maine, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia, and Florida followed this system for a number of years, but have since converted to mileage-based exit numbers. Georgia renumbered in 2000, while Maine did so in 2004. Massachusetts converted its exit numbers in 2021, and most recently Rhode Island in 2022. The Pennsylvania Turnpike uses both mile marker numbers and sequential numbers. Mile marker numbers are used for signage, while sequential numbers are used for numbering interchanges internally. The New Jersey Turnpike, including the portions that are signed as I‑95 and I‑78, also has sequential numbering, but other Interstates within New Jersey use mile markers.

===Sign locations===
There are four common signage methods on Interstates:
* Locating a sign on the ground to the side of the highway, mostly the right, and is used to denote exits, as well as rest areas, motorist services such as gas and lodging, recreational sites, and freeway names
* Attaching the sign to an overpass
* Mounting on full gantries that bridge the entire width of the highway and often show two or more signs
* Mounting on half-gantries that are located on one side of the highway, like a ground-mounted sign

==Impact and reception==

Following the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, passenger rail declined sharply as did freight rail for a short time, but the trucking industry expanded dramatically and the cost of shipping and travel fell sharply. Suburbanization became possible, with the rapid growth of larger, sprawling, and more car-dependent housing than was available in central cities, enabling racial segregation by white flight. A sense of isolationism developed in suburbs, with suburbanites wanting to keep urban areas disconnected from the suburbs. Tourism dramatically expanded, creating a demand for more service stations, motels, restaurants and visitor attractions. The Interstate System was the basis for urban expansion in the Sun Belt, and many urban areas in the region are thus very car-dependent. The highways may have contributed to increased economic productivity in, and thereby increased migration to, the Sun Belt. In rural areas, towns and small cities off the grid lost out as shoppers followed the interstate and new factories were located near them.

The system had a profound effect on interstate shipping. The Interstate Highway System was being constructed at the same time as the intermodal shipping container made its debut. These containers could be placed on trailers behind trucks and shipped across the country with ease. A new road network and shipping containers that could be easily moved from ship to train to truck, meant that overseas manufacturers and domestic startups could get their products to market quicker than ever, allowing for accelerated economic growth. Forty years after its construction, the Interstate Highway system returned on investment, making $6 for every $1 spent on the project. According to research by the FHWA, &quot;from 1950 to 1989, approximately one-quarter of the nation&#x27;s productivity increase is attributable to increased investment in the highway system.&quot;

The system had a particularly strong effect in Southern states, where major highways were inadequate. The new system facilitated the relocation of heavy manufacturing to the South and spurred the development of Southern-based corporations like Walmart (in Arkansas) and FedEx (in Tennessee).

The Interstate Highway System also dramatically affected American culture, contributing to cars becoming more central to the American identity. Before, driving was considered an excursion that required some amount of skill and could have some chance of unpredictability. With the standardization of signs, road widths and rules, certain unpredictabilities lessened. Justin Fox wrote, &quot;By making road more reliable and by making Americans more reliant on them, they took away most of the adventure and romance associated with driving.&quot;

The Interstate Highway System has been criticized for contributing to the decline of some cities that were divided by Interstates, and for displacing minority neighborhoods in urban centers. Between 1957 and 1977, the Interstate System alone displaced over 475,000 households and one million people across the country. Highways have also been criticized for increasing racial segregation by creating physical barriers between neighborhoods, and for overall reductions in available housing and population in neighborhoods affected by highway construction. Other critics have blamed the Interstate Highway System for the decline of public transportation in the United States since the 1950s, which minorities and low-income residents are three to six times more likely to use. Previous highways, such as US 66, were also bypassed by the new Interstate system, turning countless rural communities along the way into ghost towns. The Interstate System has also contributed to continued resistance against new public transportation. 

The Interstate Highway System had a negative impact on minority groups, especially in urban areas. Even though the government used eminent domain to obtain land for the Interstates, it was still economical to build where land was cheapest. This cheap land was often located in predominately minority areas. Not only were minority neighborhoods destroyed, but in some cities the Interstates were used to divide white and minority neighborhoods. These practices were common in cities both in the North and South, including Nashville, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, and many other cities. The division and destruction of neighborhoods led to the limitation of employment and other opportunities, which deteriorated the economic fabric of neighborhoods. Neighborhoods bordering Interstates have a much higher level of particulate air pollution and are more likely to be chosen for polluting industrial facilities.

<text>The United States Numbered Highway System (often called U.S. Routes or U.S. Highways) is an integrated network of roads and highways numbered within a nationwide grid in the contiguous United States. As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called Federal Highways, but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by state or local governments since their initial designation in 1926.

The route numbers and locations are coordinated by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the United States Department of Transportation. Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east and the highest in the west, while east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south, though the grid guidelines are not rigidly followed, and many exceptions exist. Major north–south routes generally have numbers ending in &quot;1&quot;, while major east–west routes usually have numbers ending in &quot;0&quot;. Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways; for example, U.S. Route 264 (US 264) is a spur off US 64. Some divided routes, such as US 19E and US 19W, exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.

Before the U.S. Routes were designated, auto trails designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States. These were private organizations, and the system of road marking at the time was haphazard and not uniform. In 1925, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways, recommended by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in November 1925. After getting feedback from the states, they made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926.

Expansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the Interstate Highway System was laid out and began construction under the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. After the national implementation of the Interstate Highway System, many U.S. Routes that had been bypassed or overlaid with Interstate Highways were decommissioned and removed from the system. In some places, the U.S. Routes remain alongside the Interstates and serve as a means for interstate travelers to access local services and as secondary feeder roads or as important major arteries in their own right. In other places, where there are no nearby Interstate Highways, the U.S. Routes often remain as the most well-developed roads for long-distance travel. While the system&#x27;s growth has slowed in recent decades, the U.S. Highway System remains in place to this day and new routes are occasionally added to the system.

==System details==
In general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later Interstate Highways, and are not usually built to freeway standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the main streets of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must &quot;substantially meet the current AASHTO design standards&quot;. the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of .

Except for toll bridges and tunnels, very few U.S. Routes are toll roads. AASHTO policy says that a toll road may only be included as a special route, and that &quot;a toll-free routing between the same termini shall continue to be retained and marked as a part of the U.S. Numbered System.&quot; U.S. Route 3 (US 3) meets this obligation; in New Hampshire, it does not follow tolled portions of the Everett Turnpike. However, US Routes in the system do use parts of five toll roads:
* US 51 uses part of the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway in Illinois; the old road is Illinois Route 251.
* US 278 uses the tolled Cross Island Parkway in South Carolina; the old road is US 278 Business. The tolls were removed in July 2021.
* US 301 is a toll road through Delaware; the former routing is a free road and uses several Delaware state routes.
* US 412 uses the Cimarron Turnpike in Oklahoma; the old road is US 64.
* US 412 also uses the Cherokee Turnpike in Oklahoma; the old road is US 412 Alternate.

===Numbering===
U.S. Routes in the contiguous United States follow a grid pattern, in which odd-numbered routes run generally north to south and even-numbered routes run generally east to west, though three-digit spur routes can be either-or. Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route. Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; U.S. Route 1 (US 1) follows the Atlantic Coast and US 101 follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first &quot;digit&quot; is &quot;10&quot;, and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; US 2 closely follows the Canadian border, and US 98 hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0; however, extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist.

The numbering system also extended beyond the borders of the United States in an unofficial manner. Many Canadian highways were renumbered in the 1940s and 1950s to adopt the same number as the U.S. Route they connected to – mostly in the western provinces. Examples include British Columbia&#x27;s highways 93, 95, 97, and 99; Manitoba&#x27;s highways 59, 75, and 83; or Ontario King&#x27;s Highway 71. The reverse happened with U.S. Route 57, originally a Texas state highway numbered to match Mexican Federal Highway 57.

In the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. Interstate Highway numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart in order to keep them from being confused with one another, and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially conflict with US 50 and US 60.

In the US Highway system, three-digit numbers are assigned to spurs of one or two-digit routes. US 201, for example, splits from US 1 at Brunswick, Maine, and runs north to Canada. Not all spurs travel in the same direction as their &quot;parents&quot;; some are connected to their parents only by other spurs, or not at all, instead only traveling near their parents, Also, a spur may travel in different cardinal directions than its parent, such as US 522, which is a north–south route, unlike its parent US 22, which is east–west. As originally assigned, the first digit of the spurs increased from north to south and east to west along the parent; for example, US 60 had spurs, running from east to west, designated as US 160 in Missouri, US 260 in Oklahoma, US 360 in Texas, and US 460 and US 560 in New Mexico. As with the two-digit routes, three-digit routes have been added, removed, extended and shortened; the &quot;parent-child&quot; relationship is not always present.

AASHTO guidelines specifically prohibit Interstate Highways and U.S. Routes from sharing a number within the same state. As with other guidelines, exceptions exist across the U.S.

Some two-digit numbers have never been applied to any U.S. Route, including 37, 39, 47, 86, and 88.

===Signage===
Route numbers are displayed on a distinctively-shaped white shield with large black numerals in the center. Often, the shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background. Each state manufactures their own signage, and as such subtle variations exist all across the United States. Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters &quot;US&quot; above the numerals. One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield. Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number. Signs are generally displayed in several different locations. First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called reassurance markers), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel. Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course. Third, they can be displayed on large green guide signs that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.

===Divided and special routes===
Since 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes. For instance, US 11 splits into US 11E (east) and US 11W (west) in Bristol, Virginia, and the routes rejoin in Knoxville, Tennessee. Occasionally only one of the two routes is suffixed; US 6N in Pennsylvania does not rejoin US 6 at its west end. AASHTO has been trying to eliminate these since 1934; its current policy is to deny approval of new split routes and to eliminate existing ones &quot;as rapidly as the State Highway Department and the Standing Committee on Highways can reach agreement with reference thereto&quot;.

Special routes—those with a banner such as alternate or bypass—are also managed by AASHTO. These are sometimes designated with lettered suffixes, like A for alternate or B for business.

===Naming===
The official route log, last published by AASHTO in 1989, has been named &quot;United States Numbered Highways&quot; since its initial publication in 1926. Within the route log, &quot;U.S. Route&quot; is used in the table of contents, while &quot;United States Highway&quot; appears as the heading for each route. All reports of the Special Committee on Route Numbering since 1989 use &quot;U.S. Route&quot;, and federal laws relating to highways use &quot;United States Route&quot; or &quot;U.S. Route&quot; more often than the &quot;Highway&quot; variants. The use of U.S. Route or U.S. Highway on a local level depends on the state, with some states such as Delaware using &quot;route&quot; and others such as Colorado using &quot;highway&quot;.

==History==

===Early auto trails===

In 1903, Horatio Nelson Jackson became the first documented person to drive an automobile from San Francisco to New York using only a connection of dirt roads, cow paths, and railroad beds. His journey, covered by the press, became a national sensation and called for a system of long-distance roads.

In the early 1910s, auto trail organizations—most prominently the Lincoln Highway—began to spring up, marking and promoting routes for the new recreation of long-distance automobile travel. The Yellowstone Trail was another of the earliest examples. While many of these organizations worked with towns and states along the route to improve the roadways, others simply chose a route based on towns that were willing to pay dues, put up signs, and did little else.

===Planning===

Wisconsin was the first state in the U.S. to number its highways, erecting signs in May 1918. Other states soon followed. In 1922, the New England states got together to establish the six-state New England Interstate Routes.

Behind the scenes, the federal aid program had begun with the passage of the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916, providing 50% monetary support from the federal government for improvement of major roads. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 limited the routes to 7% of each state&#x27;s roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be &quot;interstate in character&quot;. Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.

The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered &quot;interstate highways&quot; at its 1924 meeting. AASHO recommended that the Secretary of Agriculture work with the states to designate these routes.

Secretary Howard M. Gore appointed the &quot;Joint Board on Interstate Highways&quot;, as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925. The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal Bureau of Public Roads officials. At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name &quot;U.S. Highway&quot; as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included. The tentative design for the U.S. Route shield was also chosen, based on the shield found on the Great Seal of the United States.

The auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names. Six regional meetings were held to hammer out the details—May 15 for the West, May 27 for the Mississippi Valley, June 3 for the Great Lakes, June 8 for the South, June 15 for the North Atlantic, and June 15 for New England. Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings. However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included. The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000 km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.
The second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925. At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. William F. Williams of Massachusetts and Frederick S. Greene of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance. Greene in particular intended New York&#x27;s system to have four major through routes as an example to the other states. Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the Midwest to have added too many routes to the system. The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes. A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east–west and ten major north–south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee &quot;without instructions&quot;.

After working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000 km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4. The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by Edwin Warley James of the BPR, who matched parity to direction, and laid out a rough grid. Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred. The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26. The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture on October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.

===Disagreement and refinement, 1925–26===
The new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route. While the Lincoln Highway Association understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the US 30 designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence. At their January 14–15, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.

In the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line. (Only US 220 still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future I-86.) Because US 20 seemed indirect, passing through Yellowstone National Park, Idaho and Oregon requested that US 30 be swapped with US 20 to the Pacific coast.

Many local disputes arose related to the committee&#x27;s choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails. At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically US 40 between Manhattan, Kansas and Limon, Colorado and US 50 between Baldwin City, Kansas and Garden City, Kansas). In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other. These splits were initially shown in the log as—for instance—US 40 North and US 40 South, but were always posted as simply US 40N and US 40S.

The most heated argument, however, was the issue of US 60. The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north–south than west–east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to Oklahoma City, from where it ran west to Los Angeles. Kentucky strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east–west routes, instead receiving the US 62 designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of US 52 east of Ashland, Kentucky, as US 60. They assigned US 62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US 60. But Missouri and Oklahoma did object—Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs. A compromise was proposed, in which US 60 would split at Springfield, Missouri, into US 60E and US 60N, but both sides objected. The final solution resulted in the assignment of US 66 to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number. Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.

With 32 states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926. This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including US 6, US 19 and US 50), and some termini at state lines. By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails. In addition, U.S. Route 15 had been extended across Virginia.

Much of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names. Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The traveler may shed tears as he drives the Lincoln Highway or dream dreams as he speeds over the Jefferson Highway, but how can he get a &#x27;kick&#x27; out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?&quot; (A popular song later promised, &quot;Get your kicks on Route 66!&quot;) The writer Ernest McGaffey was quoted as saying, &quot;Logarithms will take the place of legends, and &#x27;hokum&#x27; for history.&quot;

===Expansion and adjustment, 1926–1956===
When the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating &quot;north&quot;, &quot;south&quot;, &quot;east&quot;, or &quot;west&quot;. While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.

In 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case US 37. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of &quot;American Highways&quot;:
&quot;Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word &#x27;Alternate&#x27;.&quot;Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways. Examples can be found in California, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oregon, and Tennessee. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in US 11, US 19, US 25, US 31, US 45, US 49, US 73, and US 99.

For the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were toll roads such as the Pennsylvania Turnpike and parkway routes such as the Merritt Parkway. Many of the first high-speed roads were U.S. Highways: the Gulf Freeway carried US 75, the Pasadena Freeway carried US 66, and the Pulaski Skyway carries US 1 and US 9.

===Interstate era, 1956–present===
The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 appropriated funding for the Interstate Highway System, to construct a vast network of freeways across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement—rather than replace—the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the West) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates. Major decommissioning of former routes began with California&#x27;s highway renumbering in 1964. The 1985 removal of US 66 is often seen as the end of an era of US highways.

A few major connections not served by Interstate Highways include US 6 from Hartford, Connecticut, to Providence, Rhode Island and US 93 from Phoenix, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada, though the latter is planned to be upgraded to Interstate 11. Three state capitals in the contiguous U.S. are served only by U.S. Routes: Dover, Delaware; Jefferson City, Missouri; and Pierre, South Dakota.

In 1995, the National Highway System was defined to include both the Interstate Highway System and other roads designated as important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

AASHTO is in the process of eliminating all intrastate U.S. Highways less than in length &quot;as rapidly as the State Highway Department and the Standing Committee on Highways of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials can reach agreement with reference thereto&quot;. New additions to the system must serve more than one state and &quot;substantially meet the current AASHTO design standards&quot;. A version of this policy has been in place since 1937.

==The 1925 routes==
The original major transcontinental routes in 1925, along with the auto trails which they roughly replaced, were as follows:
* US 1, Fort Kent, Maine, to Miami, Florida: Atlantic Highway
* US 11, Rouses Point, New York, to New Orleans, Louisiana
* US 21, Cleveland, Ohio, to Jacksonville, Florida (where it met US 1)
* US 31, Mackinaw City, Michigan, to Mobile, Alabama
* US 41, Copper Harbor, Michigan, to Naples, Florida: Dixie Highway
* US 51, Hurley, Wisconsin, to New Orleans, Louisiana
* US 61, Canadian border north of Grand Portage, Minnesota, to New Orleans, Louisiana
* US 71, International Falls, Minnesota, to Baton Rouge, Louisiana (where it met US 61): Jefferson Highway
* US 81, Canadian border north of Pembina, North Dakota, to Laredo, Texas: Meridian Highway
* US 91, Great Falls, Montana, to south of Las Vegas, Nevada
* US 101, Port Angeles, Washington, to San Diego, California: Pacific Highway

* US 2, Houlton, Maine, to Bonners Ferry, Idaho
* US 10, Detroit, Michigan, to Seattle, Washington: National Parks Highway
* US 20, Boston, Massachusetts, to Newport, Oregon
* US 30, Atlantic City, New Jersey: White Horse Pike, to Salt Lake City, Utah: Lincoln Highway
* US 40, Atlantic City, New Jersey: Black Horse Pike, to San Francisco, California: Victory Highway
* US 50, Annapolis, Maryland, to Wadsworth, Nevada (where it met US 40)
* US 60, Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California
* US 70, Morehead City, North Carolina, to Holbrook, Arizona (where it met US 60)
* US 80, Savannah, Georgia, to San Diego, California: Dixie Overland Highway
* US 90, Jacksonville, Florida to Van Horn, Texas, (where it met US 80): Old Spanish Trail

US 10, US 60, and US 90 only ran about two thirds of the way across the country, while US 11 and US 60 ran significantly diagonally. US 60&#x27;s violation of two of the conventions would prove to be one of the major sticking points; US 60 eventually was designated as US 66 in 1926, and later it became a part of popular culture. US 101 continues east and then south to end at Olympia, Washington. The western terminus of US 2 is now at Everett, Washington.

<text>An Erlenmeyer flask, also known as a conical flask (British English) or a [[titration]] flask, is a type of laboratory flask with a flat bottom, a conical body, and a cylindrical neck. It is named after the German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825–1909), who invented it in 1860.

Erlenmeyer flasks have wide bases and narrow necks. They may be graduated, and often have spots of ground glass or enamel where they can be labeled with a pencil. It differs from the beaker in its tapered body and narrow neck. Depending on the application, they may be constructed from glass or plastic, in a wide range of volumes.

The mouth of the Erlenmeyer flask may have a beaded lip that can be stoppered or covered. Alternatively, the neck may be fitted with ground glass or other connector for use with more specialized stoppers or attachment to other apparatus. A Büchner flask is a common design modification for filtration under vacuum.

==Uses==
===In chemistry===
The slanted sides and narrow neck of this flask allow the contents of the flask to be mixed by swirling, without risk of spillage, making them suitable for titrations by placing it under the buret and adding solvent and the indicator in the Erlenmeyer flask. Such features similarly make the flask suitable for boiling liquids. Hot vapour condenses on the upper section of the Erlenmeyer flask, reducing solvent loss. Erlenmeyer flasks&#x27; narrow necks can also support filter funnels.

The final two attributes of Erlenmeyer flasks make them especially appropriate for recrystallization. The sample to be purified is heated to a boil, and sufficient solvent is added for complete dissolution. The receiving flask is filled with a small amount of solvent, and heated to a boil. The hot solution is filtered through a fluted filter paper into the receiving flask. Hot vapors from the boiling solvent keep the filter funnel warm, avoiding the premature crystallization.

Like beakers, Erlenmeyer flasks are not normally suitable for accurate volumetric measurements. Their stamped volumes are approximate within about 5% accuracy.

===In biology===
Erlenmeyer flasks are also used in microbiology for the preparation of microbial cultures. Erlenmeyer flasks used in cell culture are sterilized and may feature vented closures to enhance gas exchange during incubation and shaking. The use of minimal liquid volumes, typically no more than one fifth of the total flask volume, and baffles molded into the flask&#x27;s internal surface both serve to maximize gas transfer and promote chaotic mixing when the flasks are orbitally shaken. The oxygen transfer rate in Erlenmeyer flasks depends on the agitation speed, the liquid volume, and the shake-flask design. The shaking frequency has the most significant impact on oxygen transfer.

Oxygenation and mixing of liquid cultures further depend on rotation of the liquid &quot;in-phase&quot;, meaning the synchronous movement of the liquid with the shaker table. Under certain conditions the shaking process leads to a breakdown of liquid motion – called &quot;out-of-phase phenomenon&quot;. This phenomenon has been intensively characterized for shake flask bioreactors. Out-of-phase conditions are associated with a strong decrease in mixing performance, oxygen transfer, and power input. Main factor for out-of-phase operation is the viscosity of the culture medium, but also the vessel diameter, low filling levels and/or a high number of baffles.

== Legal restriction ==
To impede illicit drug manufacturers, the state of Texas previously restricted the sale of Erlenmeyer flasks to those who have the requisite permits. On September 1, 2019, SB 616 amended the law so that permits are no longer required, but accurate inventory of this and certain other pieces of lab equipment must still be maintained, loss or theft must still be reported, and the owner must still allow audits of their records and equipment to be made.

<text>Laboratory glassware is a variety of equipment used in scientific work, traditionally made of glass. Glass may be blown, bent, cut, molded, or formed into many sizes and shapes. It is commonly used in chemistry, biology, and analytical laboratories. Many laboratories have training programs to demonstrate how glassware is used and to alert first–time users to the safety hazards involved with using glassware.

==History==
=== Ancient era ===
The history of glassware dates back to the Phoenicians who fused obsidian together in campfires making the first glassware. Glassware evolved as other ancient civilizations including the Syrians, Egyptians, and Romans refined the art of glassmaking. Mary the Jewess, an alchemist in Alexandria during the 1st century AD, is credited for the creation of some of the first glassware for chemical such as the &quot;kerotakis&quot; which was used for the collection of fumes from a heated material. Despite these creations, glassware for chemical uses was still limited during this time because of the low thermal stability necessary for experimentation and therefore was primarily made using copper or ceramic materials.

=== Early modern era ===
Glassware improved once again during the 14th-16th century, with the skill and knowledge of glass makers in Venice. During this time, the Venetians gathered knowledge about glassmaking from the East with information coming from Syria and the Byzantine Empire. Along with knowledge about glassmaking, glassmakers in Venice also received higher quality raw materials from the East such as imported plant ash which contained higher soda content compared to plant ash from other areas. This combination of better raw materials and information from the East led to the production of clearer and higher thermal and chemical durability leading towards the shift to the use of glassware in laboratories.

=== Modern era ===

Many glasses that were produced in bulk in the 1830s would quickly become unclear and dirty because of the low quality glass being used.
During the 19th century, more chemists began to recognize the importance of glassware due to its transparency, and the ability to control the conditions of experiments. Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who invented the test tube, and Michael Faraday both contributed to the rise of chemical glassblowing. Faraday published &quot;Chemical Manipulation&quot; in 1827 which detailed the process for creating many types of small tube glassware and some experimental techniques for tube chemistry. Berzelius wrote a similar textbook titled &quot;Chemical Operations and Apparatus&quot; which provided a variety of chemical glassblowing techniques. The rise of this chemical glassblowing widened the availability of chemical experimentation and led to a shift towards the dominant use of glassware in laboratories. With the emergence of glassware in laboratories, the need for organization and standards arose. The &quot;Prussian Society for the Advancement of Industry&quot; was one of the earliest organizations to support the collaborative improvement of the quality of glass used.

Following the development of borosilicate glass by Otto Schott in the late 19th century, most laboratory glassware was manufactured in Germany up until the start of World War I. Before World War I, glass producers in the United States had difficulty competing with German laboratory glassware manufacturers because laboratory glassware was classified as educational material and was not subject to an import tax. During World War I, the supply of laboratory glassware to the United States was cut off.

In 1915 Corning Glassworks developed their own borosilicate glass, introduced under the name Pyrex. This was a boon to the war effort in the United States. Though many laboratories turned back to imports after the war ended, research into better glassware flourished. Glassware became more resistant to thermal shock while maintaining chemical inertness.

During the 1920s efforts to standardise the dimensions of laboratory glassware began, particularly for ground glass joints, with some manufacturer specific standardisation beginning to occur around this time. Commercial standards began development around 1930, allowing the compatibility of joints between different manufacturers for the first time, along with other features. This quickly led to the high degree of standardisation and modularity seen in modern glassware.

==Laboratory glassware selection==
Laboratory glassware is typically selected by a person in charge of a particular laboratory analysis to match the needs of a given task. The task may require a piece of glassware made with a specific type of glass. The task may be readily performed using low cost, mass-produced glassware, or it may require a specialized piece created by a glass blower. The task may require controlling the flow of fluid. The task may have distinctive quality assurance requirements.

===Type of glass===

Laboratory glassware may be made from several types of glass, each with different capabilities and used for different purposes. Borosilicate glass is a type of transparent glass that is composed of boron oxide and silica, its main feature is a low coefficient of thermal expansion making it more resistant to thermal shock than most other glasses. Quartz glass can withstand very high temperatures and is transparent in certain parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Darkened brown or amber (actinic) glass can block ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Heavy-wall glass can withstand pressurized applications. Fritted glass is finely porous glass through which gas or liquid may pass. Coated glassware is specially treated to reduce the occurrence of breakage or failure. Silanized (siliconized) glassware is specially treated to prevent organic samples from sticking to the glass.

===Scientific glass blowing===
Scientific glass blowing, which is practiced in some larger laboratories, is a specialized field of glassblowing. Scientific glassblowing involves precisely controlling the shape and dimension of glass, repairing expensive or difficult-to-replace glassware, and fusing together various glass parts. Many parts are available fused to a length of glass tubing to create highly specialized piece of laboratory glassware.

===Controlling fluid flow===
When using glassware it is often necessary to control the flow of fluid. It is commonly stopped with a stopper. Fluid may be transported between connected pieces of glassware. Types of interconnecting components include glass tubing, T-connectors, Y-connectors, and glass adapters. For a leak-tight connection a ground glass joint is used (possibly reinforced using a clamping method such as a Keck clips). Another way to connect glassware is with a hose barb and flexible tubing. Fluid flow can be switched selectively using a valve, of which a stopcock is a common type fused to the glassware. Valves made entirely of glass may be used to restrict fluid flows. Fluid, or any material which flows, can be directed into a narrow opening using a funnel.

===Quality assurance===
====Metrology====
Laboratory glassware can be used for high precision volumetric measurements. With high precision measurements, such as those made in a testing laboratory, the metrological grade of the glassware becomes important. The metrological grade then can be determined by both the confidence interval around the nominal value of measurement marks and the traceability of the calibration to an NIST standard. Periodically it may be necessary to check the calibration of the laboratory glassware.

====Dissolved silica====
Laboratory glassware is composed of silica, which is considered insoluble in most substances, with a few exceptions such as hydrofluoric acid or strong alkali hydroxides. Though insoluble, a minute quantity of silica will dissolve in neutral water, which may affect high precision, low threshold measurements of silica in water.

====Cleaning====

Cleaning laboratory glassware is a frequent necessity and may be done using multiple methods depending on the nature of the contamination and the purity requirements of its use. Glassware can be soaked in a detergent solution to remove grease and loosen most contaminations, these contaminations are then scrubbed with a brush or scouring pad to remove particles which cannot be rinsed. Sturdy glassware may be able to withstand sonication as an alternative to scrubbing. Solvents are used to remove organic residues that soap cannot remove, and inorganic residues that do not dissolve in water can often be dissolved with a dilute acid. When cleaning is finished it is common practice to rinse glassware multiple times, often finally with deionised water, before suspending it upside down on drying racks. Specialised dishwashers can be used to automate these cleaning methods.

Resistant residues may require more powerful cleaning methods. Base baths are commonly used for organic residues, although the strong alkaline conditions do slowly dissolve the glass itself, and concentrated hydrochloric acid is common for removing inorganic residues. Even more severe methods exist, such as acidic peroxide (piranha solution), aqua regia, and chromic acid, but these are considered somewhat of a last resort due to the hazards of using them, and their use by students is restricted in many institutions.

For certain sensitive experiments glassware may require specialised procedures and ultra-pure water or solvents to dissolve trace quantities of specific contaminations known to interfere with an experiment.

==Examples==
There are many different kinds of laboratory glassware items:

Examples of glassware containers include:
* Beakers are simple cylindrical shaped containers used to hold reagents or samples.
* Flasks are narrow-necked glass containers, typically conical or spherical, used in a laboratory to hold reagents or samples. Examples flasks include the Erlenmeyer flask, Florence flask, and Schlenk flask.
* Reagent bottles are containers with narrow openings generally used to store reagents or samples. Small bottles are called vials.
* Jars are cylindrical containers with wide openings that may be sealed. Bell jars are used to contain vacuums.
* Test tubes are used by chemists to hold, mix, or heat small quantities of solid or liquid chemicals, especially for qualitative experiments and assays
* Desiccators of glass construction are used to dry materials or keep material dry.
* Glass evaporating dishes, such as watch glasses, are primarily used as an evaporating surface (though they may be used to cover a beaker.)
* The Petri dish is a flat dish filled with a nutritious gelatin that allows for microorganisms to quickly grow, its named after its inventor Julius Petri in the 1880s.
* Microscope slides are thin strips used to hold items under a microscope.

Examples of glassware used for measurements include:
* Graduated cylinders are thin and tall cylindrical containers used for volumetric measurements.
* Volumetric flasks are for measuring a specific volume of fluid.
* Burettes are similar to graduated cylinders but have a valve at the end used to disperse precise amounts of liquid reagents often for titrations.
* Glass pipettes are used to transfer precise quantities of fluids.
* Glass Ebulliometers are used to accurately measure the boiling point of liquids.

Other examples of glassware includes:
* Stirring rods are glass rods used to mix chemicals.
* Condensers are used to condense vapors by cooling them down and turning them into liquids.
* Glass retorts are used for distillation by heating, they have a bulb with a long curved spout.
* Drying pistols are used to free samples from traces of water, or other volatile impurities.

<doc id="43961" wikidata="Q221361" url="?curid=43961" title="Clozapine">
<text>Clozapine, sold under the brand name Clozaril among others, is a psychiatric medication and was the first atypical antipsychotic to be discovered. It is used primarily to treat people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder who have had an inadequate response to two other antipsychotics, or who have been unable to tolerate other drugs due to extrapyramidal side effects. In the US, clozapine is also approved for use in people with recurrent suicidal behavior in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. It is also used for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Clozapine is recommended by multiple international treatment guidelines, after resistance to two other antipsychotic medications, and is the only treatment likely to result in improvement if two (or one) other antipsychotic has not had a satisfactory effect. Long term follow-up studies from Finland show significant improvements in terms of overall mortality including from suicide and all causes. Clozapine is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. Common adverse effects include drowsiness, constipation, hypersalivation (increased saliva production), tachycardia, low blood pressure, blurred vision, significant weight gain, and dizziness. Clozapine is not normally associated with tardive dyskinesia (TD) and is recommended as the drug of choice when this is present, although some case reports describe clozapine-induced TD. Serious adverse effects include agranulocytosis, seizures, myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), and hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels). The use of clozapine may result rarely in clozapine-induced, gastric hypomotility syndrome, which may lead to bowel obstruction and death. The mechanism of action is not entirely clear in the current medical literature.

==History==
Clozapine was synthesized in 1958 by Wander AG, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, based on the chemical structure of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. The first test in humans in 1962 was considered a failure. Trials in Germany in 1965 and 1966 as well as a trial in Vienna in 1966 were successful. In 1967, Wander AG was acquired by Sandoz. Further trials took place in 1972 when clozapine was released in Switzerland and Austria as Leponex. Two years later, it was released in West Germany and in Finland in 1975. Early testing was performed in the United States around the same time. In 1975, 16 cases of agranulocytosis leading to 8 deaths in clozapine-treated patients, reported from 6 hospitals mostly in southwestern Finland, led to concern. Analysis of the Finnish cases revealed that all the agranulocytosis cases had occurred within the first 18 weeks of treatment and the authors proposed blood monitoring during this period. The rate of agranulocytosis in Finland appeared to be 20 times higher than in the rest of the world and there was speculation that this may have been due a unique genetic variant in the region. Whilst the drug continued to be manufactured by Sandoz, and remained available in Europe, development in the U.S. halted.

Interest in clozapine continued in an investigational capacity in the United States because, even in the 1980s, the duration of hospitalization, especially in state hospitals for those with treatment resistant schizophrenia, might often be measured in years rather than days. The role of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established by the landmark Clozaril Collaborative Study Group Study #30 in which clozapine showed marked benefits compared to chlorpromazine in a group of patients with protracted psychosis and who had already shown an inadequate response to other antipsychotics. This involved both stringent blood monitoring and a double-blind design with the power to demonstrate superiority over standard antipsychotic treatment. The inclusion criteria were patients who had failed to respond to at least three previous antipsychotics and had then not responded to a single blind treatment with haloperidol (mean dose 61 mg +/− 14 mg/d). Two hundred and sixty-eight were randomised were to double blind trials of clozapine (up to 900 mg/d) or chlorpromazine (up to 1800 mg/d). 30% of the clozapine patients responded compared to 4% of the controls, with significantly greater improvement on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression Scale, and Nurses&#x27; Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation; this improvement included &quot;negative&quot; as well as positive symptom areas. Following this study, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its use in 1990. Cautious of this risk, however, the FDA required a black box warning for specific side effects including agranulocytosis, and took the unique step of requiring patients to be registered in a formal system of tracking so that blood count levels could be evaluated on a systematic basis.

In December 2002, clozapine was approved in the US for people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder judged to be at chronic risk for suicidal behavior. In 2005, the FDA approved criteria to allow reduced blood monitoring frequency. In 2015, the individual manufacturer Patient Registries were consolidated by request of the FDA into a single shared patient registry called The Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Registry. Despite the demonstrated safety of the new FDA monitoring requirements, which have lower neutrophil levels and do not include total white cell counts, international monitoring has not been standardized.

==Medical uses==

=== Schizophrenia ===
The role of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established by a 1988 landmark multicenter double blind study in which clozapine (up to 900 mg/d) showed marked benefits compared to chlorpromazine (up to 1800 mg/d) in a group of patients with protracted psychosis who had already shown an inadequate response to at least three previous antipsychotics including a prior single blind trial of haloperidol (mean 61+/− 14 mg/d for six weeks). While there are significant side effects, clozapine remains the most effective treatment when one or more other antipsychotics have had an inadequate response. The use of clozapine is associated with multiple improved outcomes, including a reduced rate of all-cause mortality, suicide and hospitalization. In a 2013 network comparative meta-analysis of 15 antipsychotic drugs, clozapine was found to be significantly more effective than all other drugs. In a 2021 UK study, the majority of patients (over 85% of respondents) who took clozapine preferred it to their previous therapies, felt better on it and wanted to keep taking it. In a 2000 Canadian survey of 130 patients, the majority reported better satisfaction, quality of life, compliance with treatment, thinking, mood, and alertness. UK studies into the perspectives of people taking clozapine and their families following treatment with and discontinuation of clozapine describe significant stress and fearfulness of clozapine being stopped.

Clozapine is usually used for people diagnosed with schizophrenia who have had an inadequate response to other antipsychotics or who have been unable to tolerate other drugs due to extrapyramidal side effects. The US FDA authorisation also includes clozapine for the treatment of people exhibition suicidal behaviour who have schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. It is also used for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. It is regarded as the gold-standard treatment when other medication has been insufficiently effective and its use is recommended by multiple international treatment guidelines, supported by systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Whilst all current guidelines reserve clozapine for individuals in whom two other antipsychotics have already been tried, evidence indicates that clozapine might instead be used as a second line drug. Clozapine treatment has been demonstrated to produce improved outcomes in multiple domains including; a reduced risk of hospitalisation, a reduced risk of drug discontinuation, a reduction in overall symptoms and has improved efficacy in the treatment of positive psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Despite a range of side effects patients report good levels of satisfaction and long term adherence is favourable compared to other antipsychotics. Very long term follow-up studies reveal multiple benefits in terms of reduced mortality, with a particularly strong effect for reduced death by suicide, clozapine is the only antipsychotic known to have an effect reducing the risk of suicide or attempted suicide. Clozapine has a significant anti-aggressive effect. Clozapine is widely used in secure and forensic mental health settings where improvements in aggression, shortened admission and reductions in restrictive practice such as seclusion have been found. In secure hospitals and other settings clozapine has also been used in the treatment of borderline and antisocial personality disorder when this has been associated with violence or self-harm. Although oral treatment is almost universal clozapine has on occasion been enforced using either nasogastric or a short acting injection although in almost 50% of the approximately 100 reported cases patients agreed to take oral medication prior to the use of a coercive intervention. Clozapine has also been used off-label to treat catatonia with success in over 80% of cases.

=== Bipolar disorder ===
On the basis of systematic reviews clozapine is recommended in some treatment guidelines as a third or fourth line treatment for bipolar disorder. A long term follow-up study showed efficacy in terms of both psychiatric and somatic hospitialisation, but with bipolar disorder this effect was not as strong as with some other treatments (olanzapine long-acting injection (LAI) (aHR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.37–0.80), haloperidol LAI (aHR = 0.62, 0.47–0.81), zuclopenthixol LAI (aHR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.52–0.85), lithium (aHR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.71–0.76) and clozapine (aHR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.64–0.87)). Bipolar disorder is an off-label indication for clozapine.

=== Severe personality disorders ===
Clozapine is also used in borderline personality disorder and a randomized controlled trial is currently underway. The use of clozapine to treat personality disorders is uncommon and off-label.

=== Initiation ===
Whilst clozapine is usually initiated in hospital setting community initiation is also available. Before clozapine can be initiated multiple assessments and baseline investigations are performed. In the UK and Ireland there must be an assessment that the patient satisfies the criteria for prescription; treatment resistant schizophrenia, intolerance due to extrapyramidal symptoms of other antipsychotics or psychosis in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Establishing a history of treatment resistance may include careful review of the medication history including the durations, doses and compliance of previous antipsychotic therapy and that these did not have an adequate clinical effect. A diagnostic review may also be performed. That could include review of antipsychotic plasma concentrations if available. The prescriber, patient, pharmacy and the laboratory performing blood counts are all registered with a specified clozapine provider who must be advised that there is no history of neutropenia from any cause. The clozapine providers collaborate by sharing information regarding patients who have had clozapine related neutropenia or agranulocytosis so that clozapine cannot be used again on license. Clozapine may only be dispensed after a satisfactory blood result has been received by the risk monitoring agency at which point an individual prescription may be released to an individual patient only.

Baseline tests usually also include; a physical examination including baseline weight, waist circumference and BMI, assessments of renal function and liver function, an ECG and other baseline bloods may also be taken to facilitate monitoring of possible myocarditis, these might include C reactive protein (CRP) and troponin. In Australia and New Zealand pre-clozapine echocardiograms are also commonly performed. A number of service protocols are available and there are variations in the extent of pre-clozapine work ups. Some might also include fasting lipids, HbA1c and prolactin. At the Maudsley Hospital in the UK the Treat service also routinely performs a wide variety of other investigations including multiple investigations for other causes of psychosis and comorbidities including; MRI brain imaging, thyroid function tests, B12, folate and serum calcium levels, infection screening for blood borne viruses including Hepatitis B and C, HIV and syphilis as well as screening for autoimmune psychosis by anti-NMDA, anti-VGKC and Anti-nuclear antibody screening. Investigations used to monitor the possibility of clozapine related side effects such as myocarditis are also performed including baseline troponin, CRP and BNP, and for neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a CK level may also be drawn.

Other clozapine initiation schedules exist. In 2023 the Treatment Response and Resistance in Psychosis Working Group published consensus guidelines on clozapine optimisation including initiation. The Team Daniel (Dr Laitman&#x27;s regimen) includes a much slower than usual titration (25 mg increments per week rather than per day) combined with the prescription of a variety of other medications to manage side effects such as nausea, hypersalivation, acid reflux, tachycardia, nocturnal enuresis, metformin and lamotrigine.

The dose of clozapine is initially low and gradually increased over a number of weeks. Initial doses may range from 6.5 to 12.5 mg/d, increasing stepwise typically, to doses in the range of 250–350 mg per day, at which point an assessment of response will be performed. In the UK, the average clozapine dose is 450 mg/d. But response is highly variable and some patients respond at much lower doses, and vice versa. A genome wide association study from the MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics in Cardiff, UK has shown significant interethnic variation in clozapine metabolism due to variation in the frequency of CYP alleles involved in clozapine metabolism such as UGT1A and CYP1A1/1A2. This found faster average clozapine metabolism in people of sub-Saharan African ancestry than in those of European ancestry and that individuals with east Asian or southwest Asian ancestry were more likely to be slow clozapine metabolisers than those with European ancestry.

=== Monitoring ===
During the initial dose titration phase, the following are typically monitored, usually daily at first: pulse, blood pressure, and temperature. Since orthostatic hypotension can be problematic, blood pressure should be monitored both sitting and standing. If there is a significant drop then the rate of the dose increase may be slowed.

Mandatory full blood counts are performed weekly for the first 18 weeks. In some services there will also be monitoring of markers that might indicate myocarditis, troponin, CRP and BNP, although the exact tests and frequency vary between services. Weight is usually measured weekly.

Thereon other investigations and monitoring will always include full blood counts (fortnightly for 1 year then monthly). Weight, waist circumference, lipids and glucose or HbA1c may also be monitored.

=== Clozapine response and treatment optimization ===
As with other antipsychotics, and in contrast to received wisdom, responses to clozapine are typically seen soon after initiation and often within the first week. That said responses, especially those which are partial, can be delayed. Quite what an adequate trial of clozapine is, is uncertain, but a recommendation is that this should be for at least 8 weeks on a plasma trough level above 350-400 micro g/L. There is considerable inter-individual variation. A significant number of patients respond at lower and also much higher plasma concentrations and some patients, especially young male smokers may never achieve these plasma levels even at doses of 900 mg/day. Options then include either increasing the dose above the licensed maximum or the addition of a drug that inhibits clozapine metabolism. Avoiding unnecessary polypharmacy is a general principle in drug treatment. However, what constitutes &quot;unnecessary&quot; is important, because antipsychotics are associated with metabolic syndrome and a corresponding increased risk of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, especially with long-term treatment. Polypharmacy with metformin, along with statins and ACE inhibitors, have the potential to significantly attenuate this risk. However, statins may increase blood glucose levels themselves, therefore necessitating polypharmacy with metformin whenever a statin is initiated. Together, this combination may have the potential to negate the negative metabolic and cardiovascular effects associated with antipsychotics, but further research is needed.

==== Optimizing blood sampling ====
The neutrophil cut off for clozapine have shown an exceptional ability to mitigate the risk of neutropenia and agranulocytosis. There is a significant margin of safety. Some patients may have marginal neutrophil counts before and after initiation and they are at risk of premature clozapine discontinuation. A knowledge of neutrophil biology allows blood sampling optimisation. Neutrophils show a diurnal variation in response to the natural cycle of G-CSF production, they are increased in the afternoons, they are also mobilised into the circulation after exercise and smoking. Simply shifting blood sampling has been shown to avoid unnecessary discontinuations, especially in black populations. However this is a disruption to usual hospital practice. Other practical steps are to ensure that blood results become available in hours and when senior staff are available.

=== Underuse of clozapine ===
Clozapine is widely recognised as being underused with wide variation in prescribing, especially in patients with African heritage.

Psychiatrists&#x27; prescribing practices have been found to be the most significant variable regarding variance in its use. Surveys of psychiatrists&#x27; attitudes to clozapine have found that many had little experience in its use, overestimated the incidence of side effects, and did not appreciate that many patients prefer to take clozapine over other antipsychotics. In contrast to many psychiatrists&#x27; expectations most patients believe that the blood testing and other difficulties are worth the multiple benefits that they perceive. Whilst psychiatrists fear the severe adverse effects such as agranulocytosis, patients are more concerned about hypersalivation. Clozapine is no longer actively marketed and this may also be one of the explanations for its underuse.

Despite the strong evidence and universal endorsement by national and international treatment guidelines and the experiences of patients themselves, most people eligible for clozapine are not treated with it. A large study in England found that approximately 30% of those eligible for clozapine were being treated with it. Those patients that do start clozapine usually face prolonged delay, multiple episodes of psychosis and treatments such as high dose antipsychotics or polypharmacy. Instead of two previous antipsychotics many will have been exposed to ten or more drugs which were not effective. A study of 120 patients conducted in four hospitals in South-East London found a mean of 9.2 episodes of antipsychotic prescription before clozapine was initiated and the mean delay in using clozapine was 5 years. Treatments that have no evidence base or are regarded as actively harmful are used instead.

As well as variation within counties there is massive variation in the use of clozapine internationally. An international study of 17 counties found greatest use in Finland (189/100,000 persons) and New Zealand (116/100,000), and least in the Japanese cohort (0.6/100,000) and in the privately insured US cohort (14/100,000).

====Racial disparity in the use of clozapine====

A general finding in healthcare provision is that minority groups receive inferior treatment; this is a particular finding in the US. In the US a general finding is that compared to their white peers African American people are less likely to be prescribed the second generation antipsychotics, which are more expensive than alternatives and this was even apparent and especially so for clozapine when comparison was made in the Veterans Affairs medical system and when differences regarding socioeconomic factors were taken into account. As well as being less likely to start clozapine black patients are more likely to stop clozapine, possibly on account of benign ethnic neutropenia.

====Benign ethnic neutropenia====

Benign reductions in neutrophils are observed in individuals of all ethnic backgrounds. Ethnic neutropenia (BEN), neutropenia without immune dysfunction or increased liability to infection, is not due to abnormal neutrophil production; although, the exact aetiology of the reduction in circulating cells remains unknown. BEN is associated with several ethnic groups, but in particular those with Black African and West African ancestry. A difficulty with the use of clozapine is that neutrophil counts have been standardised on white populations. For significant numbers of black patients the standard neutrophil count thresholds did not permit clozapine use, as the thresholds did not take BEN into account. Since 2002, clozapine monitoring services in the UK have used reference ranges 0.5 × 109/l lower for patients with haematologically confirmed BEN and similar adjustments are available in the current US criteria, although with lower permissible minima. But even then significant numbers of black patients will not be eligible even though the low neutrophil counts do not in their case reflect disease. The Duffy–Null polymorphism, which protects against some types of malaria, is predictive of BEN. In the UK the Royal College of Psychiatrists recommends consideration of Duffy typing when using or considering clozapine for people with Black or Middle Eastern ancestry, in the UK this can be requested from the International Blood Group Reference laboratory based in Bristol.

== Adverse effects ==
Clozapine may cause serious and potentially fatal adverse effects. Clozapine carries five black box warnings, including (1) severe neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils), (2) orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon changing positions), including slow heart rate and fainting, (3) seizures, (4) myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), and (5) risk of death when used in elderly people with dementia-related psychosis. Lowering of the seizure threshold may be dose related. Increasing the dose slowly may decrease the risk for seizures and orthostatic hypotension.

Common effects include constipation, bed-wetting, night-time drooling, muscle stiffness, sedation, tremors, orthostatic hypotension, high blood sugar, and weight gain. The risk of developing extrapyramidal symptoms, such as tardive dyskinesia, is below that of typical antipsychotics; this may be due to clozapine&#x27;s anticholinergic effects. Extrapyramidal symptoms may subside somewhat after a person switches from another antipsychotic to clozapine. Sexual problems, such as retrograde ejaculation and priapism, have been reported while taking clozapine. Rare adverse effects include periorbital edema and hematological malignancy. Despite the risk for numerous side effects, many side effects can be managed while continuing to take clozapine.

=== Mortality ===
The overall all cause mortality for people with serious psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia who are prescribed clozapine is lower than those who take other treatments and much lower than those who take no drug treatments at all. Reductions are particularly marked for death by suicide but also from all natural causes. This is demonstrated by studies which have used whole-population databases, such as those completed in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Taiwan and following systematic review and meta-analysis.

=== Neutropenia and agranulocytosis ===

Clozapine use has been associated with neutropenia, and as a result clozapine therapy is typically done with stringent blood monitoring. However, meta-analysis of controlled trial data fails to show that clozapine has a stronger association with neutropenia than other antipsychotic medications, or to find a difference in rates of agranulocytosis before and after 1990 (at which point mandatory monitoring was introduced). Overall, despite the concerns relating to blood and other side effects, clozapine use is associated with a reduced mortality, especially from suicide which is a major cause of premature death in people with schizophrenia. The risk of clozapine related agranulocytosis and neutropenia warranted the mandatory use of stringent risk monitoring and management systems, which have reduced the risk of death from these adverse events to around 1 in 7,700. The association between clozapine use and specific blood dyscrasias was first noted in the 1970s when eight deaths from agranulocytosis were noted in Finland. At the time it was not clear if this exceeded the established rate of this side effect which is also found in other antipsychotics and although the drug was not completely withdrawn, its use became limited.

Clozapine Induced Neutropenia (CIN) occurs in approximately 3.8% of cases and Clozapine Induced Agranulocytosis (CIA) in 0.4%. These are potentially serious side effects and agranulocytosis can result in death. To mitigate this risk clozapine is only used with mandatory absolute neutrophil count (ANC) monitoring (neutrophils are the most abundant of the granulocytes); for example, in the United States, the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). The exact schedules and blood count thresholds vary internationally and the thresholds at which clozapine can be used in the U.S. has been lower than those currently used in the U.K. and Australasia for some time. The effectiveness of the risk management strategies used is such that deaths from these side effects are very rare occurring at approximately 1 in 7700 patients treated. Almost all the adverse blood reactions occur within the first year of treatment and the majority within the first 18 weeks. After one year of treatment these risks reduce markedly to that seen in other antipsychotic drugs 0.01% or about 1 in 10,000 and the risk of death is markedly lower still. When reductions in neutrophil levels are noted on regular blood monitoring then, depending on the value, monitoring may be increased or, if the neutrophil count is sufficiently low, then clozapine is stopped immediately and can then no longer be used within the medicinal licence. Stopping clozapine almost always results in resolution of the neutrophil reduction. However severe agranulocytosis can result in spontaneous infection and death, is a severe decrease in the amount of a specific kind of white blood cell called granulocytes. Clozapine carries a black box warning for drug-induced agranulocytosis, although meta-analysis of controlled studies comparing the association between clozapine and other antipsychotic medications and the development of neutropenia fails to show a specific clozapine related risk, which is contrary to the previously accepted beliefs. Rapid point-of-care tests may simplify the monitoring for agranulocytosis.

==== Pharmacogenetics and Mechanism of Clozapine Related Blood Dyscrasias ====
CIA is a type B idiosyncratic adverse drug reaction (ADR). It is unrelated to the mode of therapeutic action, and there is no evidence that it is dose dependent and is one of many non-chemotherapy drugs with the potential to induce an idiosyncratic drug-induced agranulocytosis (IDIN). The mechanisms of CIA have not been fully elucidated but are thought to involve a combination of toxic, immunological and genetic factors, combined with oxidised drug metabolites and HLA-activating T helper cells, which induce B cells to produce drug-dependent neutrophil antibodies. Severe life-threatening CIA has a distinctive pattern, with a continuous and rapid fall to zero or near-zero ANC within 2–15 days, followed by a prolonged nadir of a similar duration. Genetic linkage studies have identified specific HLA types and transporter genes as conferring increased risk, but the pharmacogenetics has not yet progressed so as to make testing sufficiently predictive to be used clinically, and the identified genetic risk factors are not generalisable across ethnic groups. Overall, IDINs now have a mortality estimated at 5%; this is a marked improvement compared with previous levels, owing to early recognition and the introduction of hematopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor).

Clozapine-induced neutropenia (CIN) and CIA are often regarded as synonymous, with the belief that CIN is a precursor to the more serious dyscrasia. However, there is little if any evidence to support this idea. Instead, it seems that the two are distinct, with most cases of CIN being incidental findings and artefacts of increased blood monitoring.

==== International Variation and Cost effectiveness of Monitoring ====
There is very significant international variation in the frequency of full blood count (for neutrophil counts) monitoring including both the thresholds for increased monitoring and for clozapine withdrawal as well as the duration and frequency of blood testing. The most extreme variation is between Iceland, where clozapine is given without full blood monitoring, and with no demonstrable increase in risk and Japan, where the thresholds and frequency is highest. Likewise there are differences between the US thresholds and those in the UK. The US and UK thresholds for clozapine monitoring were identical until 2015, at which point the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a reduction of 0.5 × 10−9/L for each ANC range and removed the requirement for white blood cell, eosinophil and platelet monitoring completely. The frequency used in many parts of mainland Europe and the reduced US thresholds and alternate, extended intervals in monitoring used in the Netherlands have had no demonstrable increase in risk. The rationale for monitoring after the first 18 weeks of treatment is questionable, given that monthly blood sampling is highly unlikely to detect the sudden and profound falls in ANC that accompany agranulocytosis and the economic analysis of the cost effectiveness of the current clozapine monitoring schedules shows that these are of highly questionable utility. Similarly several other drugs, for example carbimazole, which is commonly used in medical practice and with very similar risks of agranulocytosis is used without mandatory FBC monitoring.

==== Clozapine rechallenge ====
A clozapine &quot;rechallenge&quot; is when someone that experienced agranulocytosis while taking clozapine starts taking the medication again. In countries in which the neutrophil thresholds are higher than those used in the US a simple approach is, if the lowest ANC had been above the US cut off, to reintroduce clozapine but with the US monitoring regime. This has been demonstrated in a large cohort of patients in a hospital in London in which it was found that of 115 patients who had had clozapine stopped according to the US criteria only 7 would have had clozapine stopped if the US cut offs had been used. Of these 62 were rechallenged, 59 continued to use clozapine without difficulty and only 1 had a fall in neutrophils below the US cut off. Other approaches have included the use of other drugs to support neutrophil counts including lithium or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). However, if agranulocytosis still occurs during a rechallenge, the alternative options are limited.

===Cardiac toxicity===
Clozapine can rarely cause myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. A large meta-analysis of clozapine exposure to over 250,000 people revealed that these occurred in approximately 7 in 1000 patients treated and resulted in death in 3 and 4 in 10,000 patients exposed respectively and although myocarditis occurred almost exclusively within the first 8 weeks of treatment, cardiomyopathy can occur much later on. First manifestations of illness are fever which may be accompanied by symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. Typically C-reactive protein (CRP) increases with the onset of fever, and rises in the cardiac enzyme, troponin, occur up to 5 days later. Monitoring guidelines advise checking CRP and troponin at baseline and weekly for the first 4 weeks after clozapine initiation and observing the patient for signs and symptoms of illness. Signs of heart failure are less common and may develop with the rise in troponin. A recent case-control study found that the risk of clozapine-induced myocarditis is increased with increasing rate of clozapine dose titration, increasing age and concomitant sodium valproate. A large electronic health register study has revealed that nearly 90% of cases of suspected clozapine related myocarditis are false positives. Rechallenge after clozapine induced myocarditis has been performed and a protocol for this specialist approach has been published. A systematic review of rechallenge after myocarditis has shown success in over 60% of reported cases.

===Gastrointestinal hypomotility===
Another underrecognized and potentially life-threatening effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe constipation, fecal impaction, paralytic ileus, bowel obstruction, acute megacolon, ischemia or necrosis. Colonic hypomotility has been shown to occur in up to 80% of people prescribed clozapine when gastrointestinal function is measured objectively using radiopaque markers. Clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility currently has a higher mortality rate than the better known side effect of agranulocytosis. A Cochrane review found little evidence to help guide decisions about the best treatment for gastrointestinal hypomotility caused by clozapine and other antipsychotic medication. Monitoring bowel function and the preemptive use of laxatives for all clozapine-treated people has been shown to improve colonic transit times and reduce serious sequelae.

===Hypersalivation===
Hypersalivation, or the excessive production of saliva, is one of the most common adverse effects of clozapine (30–80%). The saliva production is especially bothersome at night and first thing in the morning, as the immobility of sleep precludes the normal clearance of saliva by swallowing that occurs throughout the day. While clozapine is a muscarinic antagonist at the M1, M2, M3, and M5 receptors, clozapine is a full agonist at the M4 subset. Because M4 is highly expressed in the salivary gland, its M4 agonist activity is thought to be responsible for hypersalivation. clozapine-induced hypersalivation is likely a dose-related phenomenon, and tends to be worse when first starting the medication. Besides decreasing the dose or slowing the initial dose titration, other interventions that have shown some benefit include systemically absorbed anticholinergic medications such as hyoscine, diphenhydramine and topical anticholinergic medications like ipratropium bromide. Mild hypersalivation may be managed by sleeping with a towel over the pillow at night.

===Central nervous system===
CNS side effects include drowsiness, vertigo, headache, tremor, syncope, sleep disturbances, nightmares, restlessness, akinesia, agitation, seizures, rigidity, akathisia, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, hyperkinesia, weakness, lethargy, ataxia, slurred speech, depression, myoclonic jerks, and anxiety. Rarely seen are delusions, hallucinations, delirium, amnesia, libido increase or decrease, paranoia and irritability, abnormal EEG, worsening of psychosis, paresthesia, status epilepticus, and obsessive compulsive symptoms. Similar to other antipsychotics, clozapine rarely has been known to cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

===Urinary incontinence===
Clozapine is linked to urinary incontinence, though its appearance may be under-recognized. This side-effect may be amendable to bethanechol.

===Withdrawal effects===
Abrupt withdrawal may lead to cholinergic rebound effects, such as indigestion, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, overabundance of saliva, profuse sweating, insomnia, and agitation. Abrupt withdrawal can also cause severe movement disorders, catatonia, and psychosis. Doctors have recommended that patients, families, and caregivers be made aware of the symptoms and risks of abrupt withdrawal of clozapine. When discontinuing clozapine, gradual dose reduction is recommended to reduce the intensity of withdrawal effects.

===Weight gain and diabetes===
In addition to hyperglycemia, significant weight gain is frequently experienced by patients treated with clozapine. Impaired glucose metabolism and obesity have been shown to be constituents of the metabolic syndrome and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. The data suggest that clozapine may be more likely to cause adverse metabolic effects than some of the other atypical antipsychotics. For people who gain weight because of clozapine, taking metformin may reportedly improve three of the five components of the metabolic syndrome: waist circumference, fasting glucose, and fasting triglycerides.

=== Pneumonia ===
International adverse drug effect databases indicate that clozapine use is associated with a significantly increased incidence of and death from pneumonia and this may be one of the most significant adverse events. The mechanisms for this are unknown although it has been speculated that it may be related to hypersalivation or the immune effects of clozapine&#x27;s effects on the resolution of inflammation.

=== Overdose ===

Symptoms of overdose can be variable, but often include; sedation, confusion, tachycardia, seizures and ataxia. Fatalities have been reported due to clozapine overdose, though overdoses of greater than 5000 mg have been survived.

== Drug interactions ==
Fluvoxamine inhibits the metabolism of clozapine leading to significantly increased blood levels of clozapine.

When carbamazepine is concurrently used with clozapine, it has been shown to decrease plasma levels of clozapine significantly thereby decreasing the beneficial effects of clozapine. Patients should be monitored for &quot;decreased therapeutic effects of clozapine if carbamazepine&quot; is started or increased. If carbamazepine is discontinued or the dose of carbamazepine is decreased, therapeutic effects of clozapine should be monitored. The study recommends carbamazepine to not be used concurrently with clozapine due to increased risk of agranulocytosis.

Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 and clozapine is a major CYP1A2 substrate. Randomized study reported elevation in clozapine concentration in subjects concurrently taking ciprofloxacin. Thus, the prescribing information for clozapine recommends &quot;reducing the dose of clozapine by one-third of original dose&quot; when ciprofloxacin and other CYP1A2 inhibitors are added to therapy, but once ciprofloxacin is removed from therapy, it is recommended to return clozapine to original dose.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===

Clozapine is classified as an atypical antipsychotic drug because it binds to serotonin as well as dopamine receptors. It acts as an antagonist at both receptors.

Clozapine is an inverse agonist at the 5-HT2A subtype of the serotonin receptor, putatively improving depression, anxiety, and the negative cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia.

A direct interaction of clozapine with the GABAB receptor has also been shown. GABAB receptor-deficient mice exhibit increased extracellular dopamine levels and altered locomotor behaviour equivalent to that in schizophrenia animal models. GABAB receptor agonists and positive allosteric modulators reduce the locomotor changes in these models.

Clozapine induces the release of glutamate and D-serine, an agonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, from astrocytes, and reduces the expression of astrocytic glutamate transporters. These are direct effects that are also present in astrocyte cell cultures not containing neurons. Clozapine prevents impaired NMDA receptor expression caused by NMDA receptor antagonists.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The absorption of clozapine is almost complete following oral administration, but the oral bioavailability is only 60 to 70% due to first-pass metabolism. The time to peak concentration after oral dosing is about 2.5 hours, and food does not appear to affect the bioavailability of clozapine. However, it was shown that co-administration of food decreases the rate of absorption. The elimination half-life of clozapine is about 14 hours at steady state conditions (varying with daily dose).

Clozapine is extensively metabolized in the liver, via the cytochrome P450 system, to polar metabolites suitable for elimination in the urine and feces. The major metabolite, &quot;norclozapine&quot; (desmethyl-clozapine), is pharmacologically active. The cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 1A2 is primarily responsible for clozapine metabolism, but 2C, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A3/4 appear to play roles as well. Agents that induce (e.g., cigarette smoke) or inhibit (e.g., theophylline, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine) CYP1A2 may increase or decrease, respectively, the metabolism of clozapine. For example, the induction of metabolism caused by smoking means that smokers require up to double the dose of clozapine compared with non-smokers to achieve an equivalent plasma concentration.

Clozapine and norclozapine (desmethyl-clozapine) plasma levels may also be monitored, though they show a significant degree of variation and are higher in women and increase with age. Monitoring of plasma levels of clozapine and norclozapine has been shown to be useful in assessment of compliance, metabolic status, prevention of toxicity, and in dose optimisation.

== Chemistry ==
Clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine that is structurally very similar to loxapine (originally deemed a typical antipsychotic). It is slightly soluble in water, soluble in acetone, and highly soluble in chloroform. Its solubility in water is 0.1889 mg/L (25 °C). Its manufacturer, Novartis, claims a solubility of &lt;0.01% in water (&lt;100 mg/L).
== Economics ==
Despite the expense of the risk monitoring and management systems required, clozapine use is highly cost effective, with a number of studies suggesting savings of tens of thousands of dollars per patient per year compared to other antipsychotics, as well as advantages regarding improvements in quality of life. Clozapine is available as a generic medication.

<text>Psychosurgery, also called neurosurgery for mental disorder (NMD), is the neurosurgical treatment of mental disorders. Psychosurgery has always been a controversial medical field. The modern history of psychosurgery begins in the 1880s under the Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt. The first significant foray into psychosurgery in the 20th century was conducted by the Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz who, during the mid-1930s, developed the operation known as leucotomy. The practice was enthusiastically taken up in the United States by the neuropsychiatrist Walter Freeman and the neurosurgeon James W. Watts who devised what became the standard prefrontal procedure and named their operative technique lobotomy, although the operation was called leucotomy in the United Kingdom. In spite of the award of the Nobel Prize to Moniz in 1949, the use of psychosurgery declined during the 1950s. By the 1970s the standard Freeman-Watts type of operation was very rare, but other forms of psychosurgery, although used on a much smaller scale, survived. Some countries have abandoned psychosurgery altogether; in others, for example the US and the UK, it is only used in a few centres on small numbers of people with depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
In some countries it is also used in the treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders.

Psychosurgery is a collaboration between psychiatrists and neurosurgeons. During the operation, which is carried out under a general anaesthetic and using stereotactic methods, a small piece of brain is destroyed or removed. The most common types of psychosurgery in current or recent use are anterior capsulotomy, cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy and limbic leucotomy. Lesions are made by radiation, thermo-coagulation, freezing or cutting. About a third of patients show significant improvement in their symptoms after operation. Advances in surgical technique have greatly reduced the incidence of death and serious damage from psychosurgery; the remaining risks include seizures, incontinence, decreased drive and initiative, weight gain, and cognitive and affective problems.

Currently, interest in the neurosurgical treatment of mental illness is shifting from ablative psychosurgery (where the aim is to destroy brain tissue) to deep brain stimulation (DBS) where the aim is to stimulate areas of the brain with implanted electrodes.

==Medical uses==

All the forms of psychosurgery in use today (or used in recent years) target the limbic system, which involves structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus, certain thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, and cingulate gyrus—all connected by fibre pathways and thought to play a part in the regulation of emotion. There is no international consensus on the best target site.

Anterior cingulotomy was first used by Hugh Cairns in the UK, and developed in the US by H.T. Ballantine Jr. In recent decades it has been the most commonly used psychosurgical procedure in the US. The target site is the anterior cingulate cortex; the operation disconnects the thalamic and posterior frontal regions and damages the anterior cingulate region.

Anterior capsulotomy was developed in Sweden, where it became the most frequently used procedure. It is also used in Scotland and Canada. The aim of the operation is to disconnect the orbitofrontal cortex and thalamic nuclei by inducing a lesion in the anterior limb of internal capsule.

Subcaudate tractotomy was the most commonly used form of psychosurgery in the UK from the 1960s to the 1990s. It targets the lower medial quadrant of the frontal lobes, severing connections between the limbic system and supra-orbital part of the frontal lobe.

Limbic leucotomy is a combination of subcaudate tractotomy and anterior cingulotomy. It was used at Atkinson Morley Hospital London in the 1990s and also at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Amygdalotomy, which targets the amygdala, was developed as a treatment for aggression by Hideki Narabayashi in 1961 and is still used occasionally, for example at the Medical College of Georgia.

There is debate about whether deep brain stimulation (DBS) should be classed as a form of psychosurgery.

===Effectiveness===
Success rates for anterior capsulotomy, anterior cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, and limbic leucotomy in treating depression and OCD have been reported as between 25 and 70 percent. The quality of outcome data is poor and the Royal College of Psychiatrists in their 2000 report concluded that there were no simple answers to the question of modern psychosurgery&#x27;s clinical effectiveness; studies suggested improvements in symptoms following surgery but it was impossible to establish the extent to which other factors contributed to this improvement. Research into the effects of psychosurgery has not been able to overcome a number of methodological problems, including the problems associated with non-standardised diagnoses and outcome measurements, the small numbers treated at any one centre, and positive publication bias. Controlled studies are very few in number and there have been no placebo-controlled studies. There are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses.

Modern techniques have greatly reduced the risks of psychosurgery, although risks of adverse effects still remain. Whilst the risk of death or vascular injury has become extremely small, there remains a risk of seizures, fatigue, and personality changes following operation.

A 2012 follow-up study of eight depressed patients who underwent anterior capsulotomy in Vancouver, Canada, classified five of them as responders at two to three years after surgery. Results on neuropsychological testing were unchanged or improved, although there were isolated deficits and one patient was left with long-term frontal psychobehavioral changes and fatigue. One patient, aged 75, was left mute and akinetic for a month following surgery and then developed dementia.

==By country==

===China===

In China, psychosurgical operations which make a lesion in the nucleus accumbens are used in the treatment of drug and alcohol dependence. Psychosurgery is also used in the treatment of schizophrenia, depression, and other mental disorders. Psychosurgery is not regulated in China, and its use has been criticised in the West.

===India===
India had an extensive psychosurgery programme until the 1980s, using it to treat addiction, and aggressive behaviour in adults and children, as well as depression and OCD.
Cingulotomy and capsulotomy for depression and OCD continue to be used, for example at the BSES MG Hospital in Mumbai.

===Japan===
In Japan the first lobotomy was performed in 1939 and the operation was used extensively in mental hospitals. However, psychosurgery fell into disrepute in the 1970s, partly due to its use on children with behavioural problems.

===Australia and New Zealand===

In the 1980s there were 10–20 operations a year in Australia and New Zealand. The number had decreased to one or two a year by the 1990s. In Victoria, there were no operations between 2001 and 2006, but between 2007 and 2012 the Victoria Psychosurgery Review Board dealt with 12 applications, all them for DBS.

===Europe===

In the 20-year period 1971–1991 the Committee on Psychosurgery in the Netherlands and Belgium oversaw 79 operations. Since 2000 there has been only one centre in Belgium performing psychosurgery, carrying out about 8 or 9 operations a year (some capsulotomies and some DBS), mostly for OCD.

In France about five people a year were undergoing psychosurgery in the early 1980s.
In 2005 the Health Authority recommended the use of ablative psychosurgery and DBS for OCD.

In the early 2000s in Spain about 24 psychosurgical operations (capsulotomy, cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, and hypothalamotomy) a year were being performed. OCD was the most common diagnosis, but psychosurgery was also being used in the treatment of anxiety and schizophrenia, and other disorders.

In the UK between the late 1990s and 2009 there were just two centres using psychosurgery: a few stereotactic anterior capsulotomies are performed every year at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, while anterior cingulotomies are carried out by the Advanced Interventions Service at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. The patients have diagnoses of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anxiety. Ablative psychosurgery was not performed in England between the late 1990s and 2009, although a couple of hospitals have been experimenting with DBS. In 2010, Frenchay Hospital in Bristol performed an anterior cingulotomy on a woman who had previously undergone DBS.

In Russia in 1998 the Institute of the Human Brain (Russian Academy of Sciences) started a programme of stereotactic cingulotomy for the treatment of drug addiction. About 85 people, all under the age of 35, were operated on annually. In the Soviet Union, leucotomies were used for the treatment of schizophrenia in the 1940s, but the practice was prohibited by the Ministry of Health in 1950.

===North America===

In the United States, the Massachusetts General Hospital has a psychosurgery program. Operations are also performed at a few other centres.

In Mexico, psychosurgery is used in the treatment of anorexia and aggression.

In Canada, anterior capsulotomies are used in the treatment of depression and OCD.

===South America===

Venezuela has three centres performing psychosurgery. Capsulotomies, cingulotomies and amygdalotomies are used to treat OCD and aggression.

===Early psychosurgery===

Evidence of trepanning (or trephining)—the practice of drilling holes in the skull—has been found in a skull from a Neolithic burial site in France, dated to about 5100 BC although it was also used to treat brain cranial trauma. There have also been archaeological finds in South America, while in Europe trepanation was carried out in classical and medieval times.
The first systematic attempt at psychosurgery is commonly attributed to the Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt. In December 1888 Burckhardt operated on the brains of six patients (one of whom died a few days after the operation) at the Préfargier Asylum, cutting out a piece of cerebral cortex. He presented the results at the Berlin Medical Congress and published a report, but the response was hostile and he did no further operations.
Early in the 20th century, Russian neurologist Vladimir Bekhterev and Estonian neurosurgeon Ludvig Puusepp operated on three patients with mental illness, with discouraging results.

===1930s–1950s===

Although there had been earlier attempts to treat psychiatric disorders with brain surgery, it was Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz who was responsible for introducing the operation into mainstream psychiatric practice. He also coined the term psychosurgery. Moniz developed a theory that people with mental illnesses, particularly &quot;obsessive and melancholic cases&quot;, had a disorder of the synapses which allowed unhealthy thoughts to circulate continuously in their brains. Moniz hoped that by surgically interrupting pathways in their brain he could encourage new healthier synaptic connections. In November 1935, under Moniz&#x27;s direction, surgeon Pedro Almeida Lima drilled a series of holes on either side of a woman&#x27;s skull and injected ethanol to destroy small areas of subcortical white matter in the frontal lobes. After a few operations using ethanol, Moniz and Almeida Lima changed their technique and cut out small cores of brain tissue. They designed an instrument which they called a leucotome and called the operation a leucotomy (cutting of the white matter). After twenty operations, they published an account of their work. The reception was generally not friendly but a few psychiatrists, notably in Italy and the US, were inspired to experiment for themselves.

In the US, psychosurgery was taken up and zealously promoted by neurologist Walter Freeman and neurosurgeon James Watts. They started a psychosurgery program at George Washington University in 1936, first using Moniz&#x27;s method but then devised a method of their own in which the connections between the prefrontal lobes and deeper structures in the brain were severed by making a sweeping cut through a burr hole on either side of the skull. They called their new operation a lobotomy.

Freeman went on to develop a new form of lobotomy which could be dispensed without the need for a neurosurgeon. He hammered an ice pick-like instrument, an orbitoclast, through the eye socket and swept through the frontal lobes. The transorbital or &quot;ice pick&quot; lobotomy was done under local anesthesia or using electroconvulsive therapy to render the patient unconscious and could be performed in mental hospitals lacking surgical facilities. Such was Freeman&#x27;s zeal that he began to travel around the nation in his own personal van, which he called his &quot;lobotomobile&quot;, demonstrating the procedure in psychiatric hospitals. Freeman&#x27;s patients included 19 children, one of whom was 4 years old.

The 1940s saw a rapid expansion of psychosurgery, in spite of the fact that it involved a significant risk of death and severe personality changes. By the end of the decade, up to 5000 psychosurgical operations were being carried out annually in the US. In 1949, Moniz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

Beginning in the 1940s various new techniques were designed in the hope of reducing the adverse effects of the operation. These techniques included William Beecher Scoville&#x27;s orbital undercutting, Jean Talairach&#x27;s anterior capsulotomy, and Hugh Cairn&#x27;s bilateral cingulotomy. Stereotactic techniques made it possible to place lesions more accurately, and experiments were done with alternatives to cutting instruments such as radiation. Psychosurgery nevertheless went into rapid decline in the 1950s, due to the introduction of new drugs and a growing awareness of the long-term damage caused by the operations, as well as doubts about its efficacy. By the 1970s, the standard or transorbital lobotomy had been replaced with other forms of psychosurgical operations.

===1960s to the present===
During the 1960s and 1970s, psychosurgery became the subject of increasing public concern and debate, culminating in the US with congressional hearings. Particularly controversial in the United States was the work of Harvard neurosurgeon Vernon Mark and psychiatrist Frank Ervin, who carried out amygdalotomies in the hope of reducing violence and &quot;pathologic aggression&quot; in patients with temporal lobe seizures and wrote a book entitled &quot;Violence and the Brain&quot; in 1970. The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in 1977 endorsed the continued limited use of psychosurgical procedures. Since then, a few facilities in some countries, such as the US, have continued to use psychosurgery on small numbers of patients. In the US and other Western countries, the number of operations has further declined over the past 30 years, a period during which there had been no major advances in ablative psychosurgery.

==Ethics==
Psychosurgery has a controversial history, and despite modifications, still raises serious questions about benefit, risks, and the adequacy with which consent is obtained. Its continued use is defended by references to the &quot;therapeutic imperative&quot; to do something in the case of psychiatric patients who have not responded to other forms of treatment, and the evidence that some patients see improvement in their symptoms following surgery. There remain however problems concerning the rationale, indications and efficacy of psychosurgery, and the results of the operation raise questions of &quot;identity, spirit, relationships, integrity and human flourishing&quot;.

==Individuals who underwent psychosurgery==
* Lena Zavaroni (1963–1999), Scottish child star and singer who had suffered from anorexia and depression for many years, underwent a stereotactic anterior capsulotomy at the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff in 1999. She died of pneumonia three weeks later.
* Josef Hassid: Polish violin prodigy who died at 26 following psychosurgery.
* Rosemary Kennedy: Walter Freeman&#x27;s most famous patient and sister of President John F. Kennedy. She was left with permanent mental incapacity as a result of the procedure, unable to speak or walk.
* Rose Williams: Sister of Tennessee Williams.
* Howard Dully: One of Walter Freeman&#x27;s youngest patients, author of &quot;My Lobotomy&quot; (2007).

<text>A calorimeter is a device used for calorimetry, or the process of measuring the heat of chemical reactions or physical changes as well as heat capacity. Differential scanning calorimeters, isothermal micro calorimeters, titration calorimeters and accelerated rate calorimeters are among the most common types. A simple calorimeter just consists of a thermometer attached to a metal container full of water suspended above a combustion chamber. It is one of the measurement devices used in the study of thermodynamics, chemistry, and biochemistry.

To find the enthalpy change per mole of a substance A in a reaction between two substances A and B, the substances are separately added to a calorimeter and the initial and final temperatures (before the reaction has started and after it has finished) are noted. Multiplying the temperature change by the mass and specific heat capacities of the substances gives a value for the energy given off or absorbed during the reaction. Dividing the energy change by how many moles of A were present gives its enthalpy change of reaction.

formula_1 
where is the amount of heat according to the change in temperature measured in joules and is the heat capacity of the calorimeter which is a value associated with each individual apparatus in units of energy per temperature (joules/kelvin).

==History==
In 1761 Joseph Black introduced the idea of latent heat which led to the creation of the first ice calorimeters. In 1780, Antoine Lavoisier used the heat released by the respiration of a guinea pig to melt snow surrounding his apparatus, showing that respiratory gas exchange is a form of combustion, similar to the burning of a candle. Lavoisier named this apparatus &#x27;calorimeter&#x27;, based on both Greek and Latin roots. One of the first ice calorimeters was used in the winter of 1782–83 by Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace. It relied on the heat required for the melting of ice to measure the heat released in various chemical reactions.

==Adiabatic calorimeters==

An adiabatic calorimeter is a calorimeter used to examine a runaway reaction. Since the calorimeter runs in an adiabatic environment, any heat generated by the material sample under test causes the sample to increase in temperature, thus fueling the reaction.

No adiabatic calorimeter is fully adiabatic - some heat will be lost by the sample to the sample holder. A mathematical correction factor, known as the phi-factor, can be used to adjust the calorimetric result to account for these heat losses. The phi-factor is the ratio of the thermal mass of the sample and sample holder to the thermal mass of the sample alone.

==Reaction calorimeters==
A reaction calorimeter is a calorimeter in which a chemical reaction is initiated within a closed insulated container. Reaction heats are measured and the total heat is obtained by integrating heat flow versus time. This is the standard used in industry to measure heats since industrial processes are engineered to run at constant temperatures. Reaction calorimetry can also be used to determine maximum heat release rate for chemical process engineering and for tracking the global kinetics of reactions. There are four main methods for measuring the heat in reaction calorimeter:

===Heat flow calorimeter===

The cooling/heating jacket controls either the temperature of the process or the temperature of the jacket. Heat is measured by monitoring the temperature difference between heat transfer fluid and the process fluid. In addition, fill volumes (i.e. wetted area), specific heat, heat transfer coefficient have to be determined to arrive at a correct value. It is possible with this type of calorimeter to do reactions at reflux, although it is very less accurate.

===Heat balance calorimeter===
The cooling/heating jacket controls the temperature of the process. Heat is measured by monitoring the heat gained or lost by the heat transfer fluid.

===Power compensation===
Power compensation uses a heater placed within the vessel to maintain a constant temperature. The energy supplied to this heater can be varied as reactions require and the calorimetry signal is purely derived from this electrical power.

===Constant flux===
Constant flux calorimetry (or COFLUX as it is often termed) is derived from heat balance calorimetry and uses specialized control mechanisms to maintain a constant heat flow (or flux) across the vessel wall.

==Bomb calorimeters==
A bomb calorimeter is a type of constant-volume calorimeter used in measuring the heat of combustion of a particular reaction. Bomb calorimeters have to withstand the large pressure within the calorimeter as the reaction is being measured. Electrical energy is used to ignite the fuel; as the fuel is burning, it will heat up the surrounding air, which expands and escapes through a tube that leads the air out of the calorimeter. When the air is escaping through the copper tube it will also heat up the water outside the tube. The change in temperature of the water allows for calculating calorie content of the fuel.

In more recent calorimeter designs, the whole bomb, pressurized with excess pure oxygen (typically at ) and containing a weighed mass of a sample (typically 1–1.5 g) and a small fixed amount of water (to saturate the internal atmosphere, thus ensuring that all water produced is liquid, and removing the need to include enthalpy of vaporization in calculations), is submerged under a known volume of water (ca. 2000 ml) before the charge is electrically ignited. The bomb, with the known mass of the sample and oxygen, form a closed system — no gases escape during the reaction. The weighed reactant put inside the steel container is then ignited. Energy is released by the combustion and heat flow from this crosses the stainless steel wall, thus raising the temperature of the steel bomb, its contents, and the surrounding water jacket. The temperature change in the water is then accurately measured with a thermometer. This reading, along with a bomb factor (which is dependent on the heat capacity of the metal bomb parts), is used to calculate the energy given out by the sample burn. A small correction is made to account for the electrical energy input, the burning fuse, and acid production (by titration of the residual liquid). After the temperature rise has been measured, the excess pressure in the bomb is released.

At its core, a bomb calorimeter consists of a small cup to contain the sample, oxygen, a stainless steel bomb, water, a stirrer, a thermometer, the dewar or insulating container (to prevent heat flow from the calorimeter to its surroundings) and an ignition circuit connected to the bomb. By using stainless steel for the bomb, the reaction will occur with no volume change observed.

Since there is no heat exchange between the calorimeter and surroundings (Q = 0) (adiabatic), no work is performed (W = 0)

Thus, the total internal energy change

: formula_2

Also, total internal energy change

: formula_3
: formula_4
:: (constant volume formula_5)

where formula_6 is heat capacity of the bomb

Before the bomb can be used to determine heat of combustion of any compound, it must be calibrated. The value of formula_6 can be estimated by
: formula_8
: formula_9 and formula_10 can be measured;
: formula_11
: formula_12

In the laboratory, formula_6 is determined by running a compound with known heat of combustion value: formula_14

Common compounds are benzoic acid (formula_15) or p-methyl benzoic acid (formula_16).

Temperature () is recorded every minute and formula_17

A small factor contributes to the correction of the total heat of combustion is the fuse wire. Nickel fuse wire is often used and has heat of combustion: 981.2cal/g.

In order to calibrate the bomb, a small amount (~ 1g) of benzoic acid, or p-methyl benzoic acid is weighed. 
A length of nickel fuse wire (~10 cm) is weighed both before and after the combustion process. Mass of fuse wire burned formula_18

The combustion of sample (benzoic acid) inside the bomb
: formula_19
: formula_20

Once formula_6 value of the bomb is determined, the bomb is ready to use to calculate heat of combustion of any compounds by 
:formula_22

==Combustion of non-flammables==
The higher pressure and concentration of in the bomb system can render combustible some compounds that are not normally flammable. Some substances do not combust completely, making the calculations harder as the remaining mass has to be taken into consideration, making the possible error considerably larger and compromising the data.

When working with compounds that are not as flammable (that might not combust completely) one solution would be to mix the compound with some flammable compounds with a known heat of combustion and make a pallet with the mixture. Once the of the bomb is known, the heat of combustion of the flammable compound (), of the wire () and the masses ( and ), and the temperature change (Δ&quot;T&quot;), the heat of combustion of the less flammable compound () can be calculated with:

:&quot;C&quot;LFC = &quot;C&quot;v Δ&quot;T&quot; − &quot;C&quot;FC &quot;m&quot;FC − &quot;C&quot;W &quot;m&quot;W

==Calvet-type calorimeters==
The detection is based on a three-dimensional fluxmeter sensor. The fluxmeter element consists of a ring of several thermocouples in series. The corresponding thermopile of high thermal conductivity surrounds the experimental space within the calorimetric block. The radial arrangement of the thermopiles guarantees an almost complete integration of the heat. This is verified by the calculation of the efficiency ratio that indicates that an average value of 94% ± 1% of heat is transmitted through the sensor on the full range of temperature of the Calvet-type calorimeter. In this setup, the sensitivity of the calorimeter is not affected by the crucible, the type of purgegas, or the flow rate. The main advantage of the setup is the increase of the experimental vessel&#x27;s size and consequently the size of the sample, without affecting the accuracy of the calorimetric measurement.

The calibration of the calorimetric detectors is a key parameter and has to be performed very carefully. For Calvet-type calorimeters, a specific calibration, so called Joule effect or electrical calibration, has been developed to overcome all the problems encountered by a calibration done with standard materials. The main advantages of this type of calibration are as follows:
* It is an absolute calibration.
* The use of standard materials for calibration is not necessary. The calibration can be performed at a constant temperature, in the heating mode and in the cooling mode.
* It can be applied to any experimental vessel volume.
* It is a very accurate calibration.

An example of Calvet-type calorimeter is the C80 Calorimeter (reaction, isothermal and scanning calorimeter).

==Adiabatic and Isoperibol calorimeters==

Sometimes referred to as constant-pressure calorimeters, adiabatic calorimeters measure the change in enthalpy of a reaction occurring in solution during which the no heat exchange with the surroundings is allowed (adiabatic) and the atmospheric pressure remains constant.

An example is a coffee-cup calorimeter, which is constructed from two nested Styrofoam cups, providing insulation from the surroundings, and a lid with two holes, allowing insertion of a thermometer and a stirring rod. The inner cup holds a known amount of a solvent, usually water, that absorbs the heat from the reaction. When the reaction occurs, the outer cup provides insulation. Then

: formula_23

where

:formula_24, Specific heat at constant pressure
:formula_25, Enthalpy of solution
:formula_26, Change in temperature
:formula_27, mass of solvent
:formula_28, molecular mass of solvent

The measurement of heat using a simple calorimeter, like the coffee cup calorimeter, is an example of constant-pressure calorimetry, since the pressure (atmospheric pressure) remains constant during the process. Constant-pressure calorimetry is used in determining the changes in enthalpy occurring in solution. Under these conditions the change in enthalpy equals the heat.

Commercial calorimeters operate in a similar way. The semi-adiabatic (isoperibol) calorimeters measure temperature changes up to 10°C and account for heat loss through the walls of the reaction vessel to the environment, hence, semi-adiabatic. The reaction vessel is a dewar flask which is immersed in a constant temperature bath. This provides a constant heat leak rate that can be corrected through the software. The heat capacity of the reactants (and the vessel) are measured by introducing a known amount of heat using a heater element (voltage and current) and measuring the temperature change.

Adiabatic calorimeters most commonly used in materials science research to study reactions that occur at a constant pressure and volume. They are particularly useful for determining the heat capacity of substances, measuring the enthalpy changes of chemical reactions, and studying the thermodynamic properties of materials.

==Differential scanning calorimeter==

In a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), heat flow into a sample—usually contained in a small aluminium capsule or &#x27;pan&#x27;—is measured differentially, i.e., by comparing it to the flow into an empty reference pan.

In a heat flux DSC, both pans sit on a small slab of material with a known (calibrated) heat resistance K. The temperature of the calorimeter is raised linearly with time (scanned), i.e., the heating rate 
: &quot;dT&quot;/&quot;dt&quot; = &quot;β&quot;
is kept constant. This time linearity requires good design and good (computerized) temperature control. Of course, controlled cooling and isothermal experiments are also possible.

Heat flows into the two pans by conduction. The flow of heat into the sample is larger because of its heat capacity &quot;C&quot;p. The difference in flow &quot;dq&quot;/&quot;dt&quot; induces a small temperature difference Δ&quot;T&quot; across the slab. This temperature difference is measured using a thermocouple. The heat capacity can in principle be determined from this signal:

: formula_29

Note that this formula (equivalent to Newton&#x27;s law of heat flow) is analogous to, and much older than, Ohm&#x27;s law of electric flow:

When suddenly heat is absorbed by the sample (e.g., when the sample melts), the signal will respond and exhibit a peak.

: formula_30

From the integral of this peak the enthalpy of melting can be determined, and from its onset the melting temperature.

Differential scanning calorimetry is a workhorse technique in many fields, particularly in polymer characterization.

A modulated temperature differential scanning calorimeter (MTDSC) is a type of DSC in which a small oscillation is imposed upon the otherwise linear heating rate.

This has a number of advantages. It facilitates the direct measurement of the heat capacity in one measurement, even in (quasi-)isothermal conditions. It permits the simultaneous measurement of heat effects that respond to a changing heating rate (reversing) and that don&#x27;t respond to the changing heating rate (non-reversing). It allows for the optimization of both sensitivity and resolution in a single test by allowing for a slow average heating rate (optimizing resolution) and a fast changing heating rate (optimizing sensitivity).

A DSC may also be used as an initial safety screening tool. In this mode the sample will be housed in a non-reactive crucible (often gold, or gold-plated steel), and which will be able to withstand pressure (typically up to 100 bar). The presence of an exothermic event can then be used to assess the stability of a substance to heat. However, due to a combination of relatively poor sensitivity, slower than normal scan rates (typically 2–3 °C per min) due to much heavier crucible, and unknown activation energy, it is necessary to deduct about 75–100 °C from the initial start of the observed exotherm to suggest a maximum temperature for the material. A much more accurate data set can be obtained from an adiabatic calorimeter, but such a test may take 2–3 days from ambient at a rate of 3 °C increment per half hour.

==Isothermal titration calorimeter==

In an isothermal titration calorimeter, the heat of reaction is used to follow a titration experiment. This permits determination of the midpoint (stoichiometry) (N) of a reaction as well as its enthalpy (delta H), entropy (delta S) and of primary concern the binding affinity (Ka)

The technique is gaining in importance particularly in the field of biochemistry, because it facilitates determination of substrate binding to enzymes. The technique is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry to characterize potential drug candidates.

==Continuous Reaction Calorimeter==

The Continuous Reaction Calorimeter is especially suitable to obtain thermodynamic information for a scale-up of continuous processes in tubular reactors. This is useful because the released heat can strongly depend on the reaction control, especially for non-selective reactions. With the Continuous Reaction Calorimeter an axial temperature profile along the tube reactor can be recorded and the specific heat of reaction can be determined by means of heat balances and segmental dynamic parameters. The system must consist of a tubular reactor, dosing systems, preheaters, temperature sensors and flow meters.

In traditional heat flow calorimeters, one reactant is added continuously in small amounts, similar to a semi-batch process, in order to obtain a complete conversion of the reaction. In contrast to the tubular reactor, this leads to longer residence times, different substance concentrations and flatter temperature profiles. Thus, the selectivity of not well-defined reactions can be affected. This can lead to the formation of by-products or consecutive products which alter the measured heat of reaction, since other bonds are formed. The amount of by-product or secondary product can be found by calculating the yield of the desired product.

If the heat of reaction measured in the HFC (Heat flow calorimetry) and PFR calorimeter differ, most probably some side reactions have occurred. They could for example be caused by different temperatures and residence times. The totally measured Qr is composed of partially overlapped reaction enthalpies (ΔHr) of main and side reactions, depending on their degrees of conversion (U).

== Calorimetry in Geothermal Reactors ==
Calorimeters can be used to measure the efficiency of geothermal energy conversion processes. Through measuring the heat input and output of the process, engineers can determine how effective the plant is at converting geothermal energy into usable electricity or other forms of energy.

Calorimeters can also monitor the quality of the steam extracted from the geothermal resource. By analyzing the heat content of the steam, engineers can ensure that the resource meets the required specifications for efficient energy production.

<doc id="43972" wikidata="Q27165" url="?curid=43972" title="Partial pressure">
<text>In a mixture of gases, each constituent gas has a partial pressure which is the notional pressure of that constituent gas as if it alone occupied the entire volume of the original mixture at the same temperature. The total pressure of an ideal gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture (Dalton&#x27;s Law).

In respiratory physiology, the partial pressure of a dissolved gas in liquid (such as oxygen in arterial blood) is also defined, as the partial pressure of that gas as it would be undissolved in gas phase yet in equilibrium with the liquid. This concept is also known as blood gas tension. In this sense, the diffusion of a gas liquid is said to be driven by differences in partial pressure (not concentration). In chemistry and thermodynamics, this concept is generalized to non-ideal gases and instead called fugacity.

==Symbol==
The symbol for pressure is usually or which may use a subscript to identify the pressure, and gas species are also referred to by subscript. When combined, these subscripts are applied recursively.

Examples:
*formula_1 or formula_2 = pressure at time 1
*formula_3 or formula_4 = partial pressure of hydrogen
*formula_5 or formula_6 or PaO2 = arterial partial pressure of oxygen
*formula_7 or formula_8 or PvO2 = venous partial pressure of oxygen

==Dalton&#x27;s law of partial pressures==
Dalton&#x27;s law expresses the fact that the total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases in the mixture. This equality arises from the fact that in an ideal gas, the molecules are so far apart that they do not interact with each other. Most actual real-world gases come very close to this ideal. For example, given an ideal gas mixture of nitrogen (N2), hydrogen (H2) and ammonia (NH3):

formula_9
where:
*formula_10 = total pressure of the gas mixture
*formula_11 = partial pressure of nitrogen (N2)
*formula_4 = partial pressure of hydrogen (H2)
*formula_13 = partial pressure of ammonia (NH3)

==Ideal gas mixtures==
Ideally the ratio of partial pressures equals the ratio of the number of molecules. That is, the mole fraction formula_14 of an individual gas component in an ideal gas mixture can be expressed in terms of the component&#x27;s partial pressure or the moles of the component:
formula_15

and the partial pressure of an individual gas component in an ideal gas can be obtained using this expression:
formula_16

The mole fraction of a gas component in a gas mixture is equal to the volumetric fraction of that component in a gas mixture.

The ratio of partial pressures relies on the following isotherm relation:
formula_17
* &quot;V&quot;X is the partial volume of any individual gas component (X)
* &quot;V&quot;tot is the total volume of the gas mixture
* &quot;p&quot;X is the partial pressure of gas X
* &quot;p&quot;tot is the total pressure of the gas mixture 
* &quot;n&quot;X is the amount of substance of gas (X)
* &quot;n&quot;tot is the total amount of substance in gas mixture

==Partial volume (Amagat&#x27;s law of additive volume)==
The partial volume of a particular gas in a mixture is the volume of one component of the gas mixture. It is useful in gas mixtures, e.g. air, to focus on one particular gas component, e.g. oxygen.

It can be approximated both from partial pressure and molar fraction:
formula_18
* &quot;V&quot;X is the partial volume of an individual gas component X in the mixture
* &quot;V&quot;tot is the total volume of the gas mixture
* &quot;p&quot;X is the partial pressure of gas X
* &quot;p&quot;tot is the total pressure of the gas mixture
* &quot;n&quot;X is the amount of substance of gas X
* &quot;n&quot;tot is the total amount of substance in the gas mixture

==Vapor pressure==

Vapor pressure is the pressure of a vapor in equilibrium with its non-vapor phases (i.e., liquid or solid). Most often the term is used to describe a liquid&#x27;s tendency to evaporate. It is a measure of the tendency of molecules and atoms to escape from a liquid or a solid. A liquid&#x27;s atmospheric pressure boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure and it is often called the normal boiling point.

The higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the lower the normal boiling point of the liquid.

The vapor pressure chart displayed has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids. As can be seen in the chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.

For example, at any given temperature, methyl chloride has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (−24.2 °C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere (atm) of absolute vapor pressure. At higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is less than that at sea level, so boiling points of liquids are reduced. At the top of Mount Everest, the atmospheric pressure is approximately 0.333 atm, so by using the graph, the boiling point of diethyl ether would be approximately 7.5 °C versus 34.6 °C at sea level (1 atm).

==Equilibrium constants of reactions involving gas mixtures==
It is possible to work out the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction involving a mixture of gases given the partial pressure of each gas and the overall reaction formula. For a reversible reaction involving gas reactants and gas products, such as:
&lt;chem display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;{\mathit{a}A} + {\mathit{b}B} &lt;=&gt; {\mathit{c}C} + {\mathit{d}D}&lt;/chem&gt;

the equilibrium constant of the reaction would be:
formula_19

For reversible reactions, changes in the total pressure, temperature or reactant concentrations will shift the equilibrium so as to favor either the right or left side of the reaction in accordance with Le Chatelier&#x27;s Principle. However, the reaction kinetics may either oppose or enhance the equilibrium shift. In some cases, the reaction kinetics may be the overriding factor to consider.

==Henry&#x27;s law and the solubility of gases==
Gases will dissolve in liquids to an extent that is determined by the equilibrium between the undissolved gas and the gas that has dissolved in the liquid (called the &quot;solvent&quot;). The equilibrium constant for that equilibrium is:

where:
*formula_20 =  the equilibrium constant for the solvation process
*formula_21 =  partial pressure of gas formula_22 in equilibrium with a solution containing some of the gas 
*formula_23 =  the concentration of gas formula_22 in the liquid solution

The form of the equilibrium constant shows that the concentration of a solute gas in a solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution. This statement is known as Henry&#x27;s law and the equilibrium constant formula_20 is quite often referred to as the Henry&#x27;s law constant.

Henry&#x27;s law is sometimes written as:
where formula_26 is also referred to as the Henry&#x27;s law constant. As can be seen by comparing equations () and () above, formula_26 is the reciprocal of formula_20. Since both may be referred to as the Henry&#x27;s law constant, readers of the technical literature must be quite careful to note which version of the Henry&#x27;s law equation is being used.

Henry&#x27;s law is an approximation that only applies for dilute, ideal solutions and for solutions where the liquid solvent does not react chemically with the gas being dissolved.

==In diving breathing gases==
In underwater diving the physiological effects of individual component gases of breathing gases are a function of partial pressure.

Using diving terms, partial pressure is calculated as:
:partial pressure = (total absolute pressure) × (volume fraction of gas component)

For the component gas &quot;i&quot;:
:pi = P × Fi

For example, at underwater, the total absolute pressure is (i.e., 1 bar of atmospheric pressure + 5 bar of water pressure) and the partial pressures of the main components of air, oxygen 21% by volume and nitrogen approximately 79% by volume are:
:pN2 = 6 bar × 0.79 = 4.7 bar absolute
:pO2 = 6 bar × 0.21 = 1.3 bar absolute

The minimum safe lower limit for the partial pressures of oxygen in a breathing gas mixture for diving is absolute. Hypoxia and sudden unconsciousness can become a problem with an oxygen partial pressure of less than 0.16 bar absolute. Oxygen toxicity, involving convulsions, becomes a problem when oxygen partial pressure is too high. The NOAA Diving Manual recommends a maximum single exposure of 45 minutes at 1.6 bar absolute, of 120 minutes at 1.5 bar absolute, of 150 minutes at 1.4 bar absolute, of 180 minutes at 1.3 bar absolute and of 210 minutes at 1.2 bar absolute. Oxygen toxicity becomes a risk when these oxygen partial pressures and exposures are exceeded. The partial pressure of oxygen also determines the maximum operating depth of a gas mixture.

Narcosis is a problem when breathing gases at high pressure. Typically, the maximum total partial pressure of narcotic gases used when planning for technical diving may be around 4.5 bar absolute, based on an equivalent narcotic depth of .

The effect of a toxic contaminant such as carbon monoxide in breathing gas is also related to the partial pressure when breathed. A mixture which may be relatively safe at the surface could be dangerously toxic at the maximum depth of a dive, or a tolerable level of carbon dioxide in the breathing loop of a diving rebreather may become intolerable within seconds during descent when the partial pressure rapidly increases, and could lead to panic or incapacitation of the diver.

==In medicine==
The partial pressures of particularly oxygen (formula_29) and carbon dioxide (formula_30) are important parameters in tests of arterial blood gases, but can also be measured in, for example, cerebrospinal fluid.

<text>SS &quot;General von Steuben was a German [[passenger liner]] and later an armed [[transport ship]] of the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] that was sunk in the [[Baltic Sea]] during [[World War II]]. She was launched in 1923 as München (after the [[Munchen|German city]], sometimes spelled Muenchen), renamed General von Steuben in 1930 (after the [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|famous German officer]] of the [[American Revolutionary War]]), and renamed Steuben&quot; in 1938.

During World War II, the ship served as a troop accommodation vessel, and from 1944 as an armed transport. On 10 February 1945, while evacuating German military personnel, wounded soldiers, and civilian refugees during Operation Hannibal, the ship was torpedoed by the Soviet submarine &quot;S-13&quot; and sank. An estimated 4,000 people lost their lives in the sinking.

==Early history==

In 1923, &quot;München&quot; became the first German trans-Atlantic passenger liner to be launched, and also the first to enter New York Harbor, since the end of World War I. She arrived in July 1923 on her maiden transatlantic voyage.

==1930 fire and sinking==
On 11 February 1930, after &quot;München&quot; docked in New York City and discharged passengers and most of her crew from a voyage from Bremen, Germany, a fire broke out in a paint locker on board and quickly spread to another storage hold. The massive fire and explosion resulted in a five-alarm fire and all of the city&#x27;s fire equipment was sent to the burning ship. The fire could not be controlled and the ship sank next to the wharf where it had docked.

In one of the largest shipping salvage efforts of its time, &quot;München&quot; was raised, towed to a dry dock, repaired, and returned to service. Shortly afterwards, the ship&#x27;s owner renamed her &quot;General von Steuben.&quot;

==World War II==
The ship, now called &quot;Steuben&quot;, was commissioned in 1939 as a &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; accommodation ship. In 1944, she was pressed into service as an armed transport ship, taking German troops to eastern Baltic ports and returning wounded troops to Kiel.

===Operation Hannibal===
Along with the and numerous other vessels, &quot;Steuben&quot; was part of the largest evacuation by sea in modern times. The Operation Hannibal evacuations surpassed the British evacuation at Dunkirk in both size of the operation and number of people evacuated.

By early January 1945, Grossadmiral Karl Dönitz realized that Germany was soon to be defeated. Wishing to save his submariners, he radioed a coded message on 23 January 1945 to the Baltic Sea port of Gotenhafen (the Polish city and port of Gdynia under German occupation) to evacuate to the West, under the code name &quot;Operation Hannibal&quot;.

Submariners at that point were schooled and housed in ships floating in the Baltic ports, most of them at Gotenhafen. Among the ships were , , &quot;Hansa&quot;, and &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;.

Notwithstanding the losses suffered during the operation, over two million people were evacuated ahead of the Red Army&#x27;s advance into East Prussia and Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland).

In the winter of 1945, East Prussian refugees headed west, away from the city of Königsberg and ahead of the Soviet advance into the Baltic States and East Prussia. Thousands fled to the Baltic seaport at Pillau (now Baltiysk, Russia), hoping to board ships that would carry them to the relative safety of Western Germany. &quot;Steuben&quot; was part of the fleet sent for the purpose.

===Final voyage===
On 9 February 1945, the 14,660-ton &quot;Steuben&quot; sailed from Pillau, near Königsberg on the Baltic coast, for Swinemünde (now Świnoujście, Poland). Official reports listed 2,800 wounded German soldiers; 800 civilians; 100 returning soldiers; 270 navy medical personnel (including doctors, nurses and auxiliaries); 12 nurses from Pillau; 64 crew for the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns, 61 naval personnel, radio operators, signal men, machine operators and administrators, plus 160 merchant navy crewmen, for a total of 4,267 people on board. Due to the rapid evacuation ahead of the Red Army&#x27;s advance, many Eastern German and Baltic refugees boarded the &quot;Steuben&quot; without being registered, increasing the number of those on board to approximately 5,200.

Just before midnight on 9 February, the Soviet submarine &quot;S-13&quot;, commanded by Alexander Marinesko, fired two torpedoes 14 seconds apart at the &quot;Steuben&quot;; both hit her starboard bow, just below the bridge, where many of the crew were sleeping. Most were killed by the impact of the torpedoes. According to survivors, the &quot;Steuben&quot; sank by the bow and listed severely to starboard before taking her final plunge, within about 20 minutes of the torpedo impacts. An estimated 4,500 people died in the sinking. German torpedo boat &quot;T-196&quot; hastily pulled up beside &quot;Steuben&quot; as she sank; its crew pulled about 300 survivors straight from &quot;Steuben&quot;&#x27;s slanting decks and brought them to Kolberg in Pomerania (today Kołobrzeg, Poland). A total of 650 people were rescued from the &quot;Steuben&quot;.

==Wreck==

The &quot;Steuben&quot; wreck was found and identified in May 2004 by Polish Navy hydrographical vessel ORP &quot;Arctowski&quot;. Pictures and graphics appeared in a 2005 &quot;National Geographic&quot; article.

The wreck lies on its port side at about in depth, and the hull reaches up to in depth. The ship was mostly intact when it was found.

In July 2021, the German news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported that the wreck had been plundered and severely damaged in the process. The wreck is an official war grave, and entering it is illegal. Due to international treaties, the wreck remains property of the German state, but Poland is responsible for its protection. Over the past decade, looting has become one of the biggest reasons for the deteriorating condition of shipwrecks in the Baltic sea.
