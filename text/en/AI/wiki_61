<text>In linguistics, grammatical number is a feature of nouns, pronouns, adjectives and verb agreement that expresses count distinctions (such as &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot; or &quot;three or more&quot;). English and many other languages present number categories of singular or plural. Some languages also have a dual, trial and paucal number or other arrangements.

The word &quot;number&quot; is also used in linguistics to describe the distinction between certain grammatical aspects that indicate the number of times an event occurs, such as the semelfactive aspect, the iterative aspect, etc. For that use of the term, see &quot;Grammatical aspect&quot;.

==Overview==
Most languages of the world have formal means to express differences of number. One widespread distinction, found in English and many other languages, involves a simple two-way contrast between singular and plural number (&quot;car&quot;/&quot;cars&quot;, &quot;child&quot;/&quot;children&quot;, etc.). Discussion of other more elaborate systems of number appears below.

Grammatical number is a morphological category characterized by the expression of quantity through inflection or agreement. As an example, consider the English sentences below:
: &quot;That apple on the table is fresh.&quot;
: &quot;Those two apples on the table are fresh.&quot;

The quantity of apples is marked on the noun—&quot;apple&quot; singular number (one item) vs. &quot;apples&quot; plural number (more than one item)—on the demonstrative, &quot;that/those&quot;, and on the verb, &quot;is/are&quot;. In the second sentence, all this information is redundant, since quantity is already indicated by the numeral &quot;two&quot;.

A language has grammatical number when its noun forms are subdivided into morphological classes according to the quantity they express, such that:
#Every noun form belongs to a number class (they are partitioned into disjoint classes by number).
#Noun modifiers (such as adjectives) and verbs may also have different forms for each number subclass and inflect to match the number of the nouns they modify or agree with (number is an agreement category).

This is partly true for English: every noun and pronoun form is singular or plural (a few, such as &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;cannon&quot; and &quot;you&quot;, can be either, according to context). Some modifiers of nouns—namely the demonstrative determiners—and finite verbs inflect to agree with the number of the noun forms they modify or have as subject: &quot;this car&quot; and &quot;these cars&quot; are correct, while *&quot;this cars&quot; and *&quot;these car&quot; are incorrect. However, adjectives do not inflect for and many verb forms do not distinguish between singular and plural (&quot;She/They went&quot;, &quot;She/They can go&quot;, &quot;She/They had gone&quot;, &quot;She/They will go&quot;). 

Many languages distinguish between count nouns and mass nouns. Only count nouns can be freely used in the singular and in the plural. Mass nouns, like &quot;milk&quot;, &quot;gold&quot;, and &quot;furniture&quot;, are normally invariant. (In some cases, a normally mass noun X may be used as a count noun to collect several distinct kinds of X into an enumerable group; for example, a cheesemaker might speak of goat, sheep, and cow milk as &quot;milks&quot;.) 

Not all languages have number as a grammatical category. In those that do not, quantity must be expressed either directly, with numerals, or indirectly, through optional quantifiers. However, many of these languages compensate for the lack of grammatical number with an extensive system of measure words.

Joseph Greenberg has proposed a number category hierarchy as a linguistic universal: &quot;No language has a trial number unless it has a dual. No language has a dual unless it has a plural.&quot; This hierarchy does not account for the paucal.

==Geographical distribution==
Obligatory plural marking of all nouns is found throughout the languages of western and northern Eurasia and most parts of Africa. The rest of the world&#x27;s languages present a heterogeneous picture. Optional plural marking is common in Southeast and East Asia and Australian languages, and complete lack of plural marking is particularly found in New Guinea and Australian languages. In addition to the areal correlations, there also seems to be at least one correlation with morphological typology: isolating languages appear to favor no or non-obligatory plural marking. This can be seen particularly in Africa, where optionality or absence of plural marking is found particularly in the isolating languages of West Africa.

==Types of number==
===Singular and plural===
One of the simplest number distinctions a language can make is singular and plural. Singular denotes exactly one referent, while plural denotes more than one referent. For example, in English:

*&quot;dog&quot; (singular, one)
*&quot;dogs&quot; (plural, two or more)

To mark number, English has different singular and plural forms for nouns and verbs (in the third person): &quot;my dog watches television&quot; (singular) and &quot;my dogs watch television&quot; (plural). This is not universal: Wambaya marks number on nouns but not verbs, and Onondaga marks number on verbs but not nouns. Latin has different singular and plural forms for nouns, verbs, &quot;and&quot; adjectives, in contrast to English where adjectives do not change for number. Tundra Nenets can mark singular and plural on nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and postpositions. However, the most common part of speech to show a number distinction is pronouns. An example of a personal pronoun system distinguishing singular and plural is that of Wayoró:

===Dual===
Like the singular denotes exactly one item, the dual number denotes exactly two items. For example, in Camsá:

* - &quot;dog&quot; (singular)
* - &quot;two dogs&quot; (dual)
* - &quot;dogs&quot; (plural)

In languages with a singular/dual/plural paradigm, the exact meaning of plural depends on whether the dual is obligatory or facultative (optional). In contrast to English and other singular/plural languages where plural means two or more, in languages with an obligatory dual, plural strictly means three or more. This is the case for Sanskrit, North Mansi, and Alutiiq. In languages with a facultative dual, two of something can be referred to using either the dual or the plural, and so plural means two or more. This is the case for modern Arabic dialects, at least some Inuktitut dialects, and Yandruwandha. In some languages, the dual is obligatory in certain cases but facultative in others. In Slovene, it is obligatory for pronouns but facultative for nouns. In Comanche, it is obligatory when referring to humans, facultative for other animate nouns, and rarely used for inanimate nouns.

There are also languages where use of the dual number is more restricted than singular and plural. In the possessive noun forms of Northern Sámi, the possessor can be in the dual number, but the noun possessed can only be singular or plural. Pronouns are the only part of speech with a dual form in some Polynesian languages, including Samoan, Tuvaluan, and Māori. In Maltese, the dual only exists for about 30 specific nouns, of which it is obligatory for only 8 (hour, day, week, month, year, once, hundred, and thousand). Words that can take a facultative dual in Maltese include egg, branch, tear, and wicker basket. In Mezquital Otomi, the dual can only be used by an adult male speaking to another adult male.

Dual number existed in all nouns and adjectives of Proto-Indo-European around 4000 BCE, and was inherited in some form in many of its prehistoric, protohistoric, ancient, and medieval descendents. Only rarely has it persisted in Indo-European languages to the modern day. It survived in Proto-Germanic in the first and second person pronouns, where it was then inherited by Old English, Old High German, Old Low German, Early Old Swedish, Old Norwegian, Old Icelandic, and Gothic. It continued in Icelandic until the 1700s, some dialects of Faroese until at least the late 1800s, and some dialects of North Frisian through the 1900s. From Proto-Greek it entered Ancient Greek, and from Proto-Indo-Iranian it entered Sanskrit. From Proto-Slavic, it still exists today in Slovene and the Sorbian languages. Indo-European languages that have long ago lost the dual still sometimes have residual traces of it, such as the English distinctions &quot;both&quot; vs. &quot;all&quot;, &quot;either&quot; vs. &quot;any&quot;, and &quot;neither&quot; vs. &quot;none&quot;. The Norwegian , cognate with English &quot;both&quot;, has further evolved to be able to refer to more than two items, as in , literally &quot;both apples, pears, and grapes.&quot;

===Trial===

The trial number denotes exactly three items. For example, in Awa:

* - &quot;dog&quot; (singular)
* - &quot;two dogs&quot; (dual)
* - &quot;three dogs&quot; (trial)
* - &quot;dogs&quot; (plural)

It is rare for a language to mark the trial on nouns, and some sources even claim that trial marking on nouns does not exist. However, it has been recorded for a few languages; besides Awa, Arabana, Urama, and Angaataha have trial number. It is much more common for a language to have trial pronouns, the case for the Austronesian languages of Larike, Tolai, Raga, and Wamesa. A minimal example is Nukna, which has only a single trial pronoun, , which can be either 2nd or 3rd person. The trial may also be marked on verbs, such as in Lenakel.

While the dual can be obligatory or facultative, according to Greville Corbett there are no known cases of an obligatory trial, so the trial might always be facultative. However, languages may have both a facultative dual and a facultative trial, like in Larike, or an obligatory dual and a facultative trial, like in Ngan&#x27;gi.

Most languages with a trial are in the Austronesian family, and most non-Austronesian languages with a trial are nearby in Oceania. The latter category includes the Austronesian-influenced English creole languages of Tok Pisin, Bislama, and Pijin. In Australia, the trial can also be found in Aboriginal languages of many different language families. In Indonesia, trial pronouns are common in the storytelling of Abun, a possible language isolate. In the Solomon Islands, trial pronouns are used very frequently in Touo, either a Central Solomon language or a language isolate. As a result, bilingual speakers of Touo and Pijin will use trial pronouns a lot more commonly in Pijin than other speakers, for whom the trial is usually a lot less common than the dual. A very rare example of a spoken language with the trial (in both pronouns and verbs) outside of Oceania is Muklom Tangsa, spoken in northeast India.

===Paucal===
The paucal number represents &#x27;a few&#x27;, a small inexactly numbered group of items. For example, in Motuna:

* - &quot;dog&quot; (singular)
* - &quot;two dogs&quot; (dual)
* - &quot;a few dogs&quot; (paucal)
* - &quot;dogs&quot; (plural)

Almost all languages with a paucal also have a dual. However, this is not universal. Nouns in Mocoví only have singular, paucal, and plural. On the other hand, the pronouns in Mussau and Lihir have dual, trial, and paucal.

The lower bound of the paucal is usually defined by what other number categories exist in the language. In singular/paucal/plural paradigms, use of the paucal begins at two, but with the addition of the dual, the paucal begins at three. There is usually no exact upper bound on how many paucal refers to, and its approximate range depends on both language and context. It has been recorded as going up to about 5 in Warndarrang, about 6 in Baiso, 10 in Arabic, and about 10 or 15 in Murrinh-patha. In Manam, the primary factor for using the paucal is not a specific number range, but the referents forming a single group; although the paucal is most common between 3 and 5, it has been used with more than 20. In Paamese, a major factor is relative group size compared to the plural, such that even though the paucal generally means 12 or fewer, a group of 2,000 people may be referred to in the paucal when contrasted with a group of 100,000 referred to in the plural.

Much like the dual, it is crosslinguistically variable which words and parts of speech may be marked with the paucal. Baiso has the paucal only for nouns and not pronouns, whereas Yimas has the paucal only for pronouns and not nouns. In Meryam Mir, the paucal is mostly marked on the verbs. Avar has the paucal for only about 90 specific nouns, including brush, spade, snake, and daughter-in-law (the only kin term that can take the paucal in Avar). Takivatan Bunun has a paucal only in its distal demonstratives used in reference to people.

It is common for former trials to evolve in meaning to become paucals, and many Austronesian languages have paucal markers that are etymologically derived from the numeral three, indicating the old usage. It is less common for duals to evolve into paucals, but this has been observed in some dialects of Arabic. Paucals that are etymologically trials are sometimes incorrectly described as being trials. For example, trial pronouns were once described as being found in all the Kiwaian languages, but it is now recognized that many actually have a paucal instead. Linguist Michael Cysouw has suggested that &quot;most&quot; languages reported to have trials in fact have mislabelled paucals, and that true trials are very rare. On the other hand, Luise Hercus stated in her published grammar of Arabana that the language&#x27;s trial (which can be marked on nouns) is a true trial which cannot act as a paucal. Similar things have been said about trial pronouns in Larike and Anejom̃.

Russian has what has variably been called paucal numerals, the count form, the adnumerative, or the genitive of quantification. When a noun in the nominative case has a numeral added to quantify it, the noun becomes genitive singular with 2, 3, or 4, but genitive plural with 5 or above. Many linguists have described these as paucal constructions. However, some have disagreed on the grounds that a Russian noun cannot be declined to stand by itself and mean anywhere between 2 and 4. Similar constructions can be found in other Slavic languages, including Polish, Serbo-Croatian, and Slovene. Because Slovene also has a regular dual, there is a four-way distinction of nouns being singular with 1, dual with 2, plural with 3 or 4, and genitive plural with 5 or more.

===Greater paucal===

The greater paucal number is a larger paucal category, for an inexactly numbered group that is larger in size than a smaller paucal. It can be found in the pronouns of the Austronesian language of Sursurunga, which exhibit a five-way distinction described as singular, dual, paucal, greater paucal, and plural. The Sursurunga paucal is used for smaller groups, usually of about three or four, or for nuclear families of any size. The Sursurunga greater paucal is used for groups of four or more (and must be used instead of the plural for a group of two or more dyads). There is thus some overlap between the two groups; a family of four can be referred to in Sursurunga by either of the paucals. This distinction is found both in Sursurunga&#x27;s personal pronouns and in two different sets of possessive pronouns, one for edible things and one for non-edible things.

===Quadral===

The quadral number denotes exactly four items. Apparent examples of its use are almost entirely confined to pronouns, and specifically those in the languages of Oceania or in sign languages. It has been contested whether the quadral truly exists in natural language; some linguists have rejected it as an extant category, while others have accepted it. Some languages that have previously been described as having a quadral, like Sursurunga, have since been reanalyzed as having a paucal instead.

Like trial forms, quadral forms of pronouns have been said to be attested in the Melanesian pidgins of Tok Pisin, Bislama, and Pijin. However, while these are grammatically possible, they are rare, and plural forms are almost always used in their place.

Many different sign languages have been explicitly described as having quadral pronoun forms. Estonian Sign Language has even been described as having the quadral for nouns.

Marshallese has been said to have the quadral as a regular feature in its pronoun system. While the apparent Marshallese quadral can mean exactly four, it also has an alternate rhetorical use in speeches to larger groups in order to impart a sense of individual intimacy. According to Greville Corbett, this means it is better classified as a paucal. However, there is not consensus that this alternate use means Marshallese does not truly have a quadral; the final 2016 reference grammar of Marshallese by Byron W. Bender, a linguist with expertise in the language, still refers to it as having a quadral. Besides singular, dual, trial, and quadral or paucal, Marshallese additionally has two different plural forms, one for five or more and one for two or more (referred to as multiple and plural absolute respectively), creating a partially overlapping six-way number distinction. Kove has been recorded as having a similar pronoun system as Marshallese, with one addition: the plural (2+) is split between two categories, one for members of the same family and one for members of different families, creating a seven-way distinction.

A few other languages have also been claimed to have quadral pronouns. Robert Blust and others have said they exist in some of the Austronesian Kenyah languages, specifically the highland Lepoʼ Sawa dialect spoken in Long Anap. There seems to be no other published sources of info on this dialect&#x27;s pronouns, and an investigation into the lowland Lebo’ Vo’ dialect has revealed a paucal instead of a quadral. A quadral claim has also been made for the animate demonstrative pronouns in Nauruan. Outside the Austronesian family, Abun storytelling reportedly frequently contains quadral pronouns in addition to trial ones. Perhaps the only known spoken language outside Oceania to have a claimed quadral is Apinayé of Brazil, recorded as having a third person pronominal prefix meaning &quot;they four&quot;, although this has been little researched or described.

In some Austronesian languages with a singular/dual/trial/plural pronoun system, the plural forms are etymologically related to the number four. This has led to suggestions or assertions that historically a true quadral did exist, but it has since morphed into a plural form. It has thus been hypothesized that the quadral existed in Proto-Oceanic and Proto-Southern Vanuatu.

===Quintal===

The quintal number denotes exactly five items. Apparent examples of its use can mostly only be found in pronouns of sign languages. Like the quadral, its existence has been contested, and only some classifications accept it.

Like trial and quadral forms, rare quintal forms of pronouns have been said to be attested in Tok Pisin and Bislama. These languages insert numerals to represent exact numbers of referents. For example, in Bislama, the numerals (two) and (three) are contained within the second person pronouns (dual) and (trial). These forms theoretically have no specific limit, but in practicality usually stop at three.

Sign languages described as having a quintal in addition to the quadral include American Sign Language, Argentine Sign Language, British Sign Language, German Sign Language, Levantine Arabic Sign Language, and Ugandan Sign Language.

The validity has been debated of categorizing sign language pronouns as having a quadral or a quintal. Linguist Susan McBurney has contended that American Sign Language has a true dual, but that the trial, quadral, and quintal should instead be classified as numeral incorporation rather than grammatical number. This is motivated by the dual marker handshape being distinct from the handshape for the numeral two, in contrast to higher number markers; the ability to also incorporate these numerals into other words, including those for times and amounts; and the use of markers higher than the dual not being obligatory, with replacement by the plural being acceptable. There was not enough data available to McBurney to argue whether or not these reasons equally applied to other sign languages. Linguist Raquel Veiga Busto has argued they do not equally apply to Catalan Sign Language, and has applied the terms quadral and quintal to the language&#x27;s pronouns for convenience without taking an official stance as to whether they are grammatical number or numeral incorporation. A third model is to categorize the apparent trial/quadral/quintal forms as &quot;cardinal plurals&quot;, or forms of the grammatical plural number where the number of people is specified. Other authors have treated these concepts as perfectly equivalent, referring to pronoun numeral incorporation while still applying the terms quadral and quintal.

There are also cases of sign language pronouns indicating specific numbers of referents above five. Ugandan Sign Language has a rare pronoun form for exactly six people. Some American Sign Language speakers have incorporated numerals up to nine into inclusive pronouns upon solicitation. Israeli Sign Language theoretically has the grammatical ability to incorporate numerals up to ten into pronouns.

===Greater plural===

Greater plural is a number larger than and beyond plural. In various forms across different languages, it has also been called the global plural, the remote plural, the plural of abundance, the unlimited plural, and the superplural. For example, in Tswana:

* - &quot;dog&quot; (singular)
* - &quot;dogs&quot; (plural)
* - &quot;a very large number of dogs&quot; (greater plural)

The greater plural may also be a component of larger number systems. Nouns in Barngarla have a four-way distinction of singular, dual, plural, and greater plural. The same four-way distinction is found in Mokilese pronouns, where a former trial has evolved to become a plural, leaving the former plural with a greater plural meaning. A different four-way distinction of singular, paucal, plural, and greater plural can be found in some verbs of Hualapai. A more complex system is found in Mele-Fila: pronouns distinguish singular, dual, plural, and greater plural, but articles attached to nouns distinguish singular, paucal, and plural. The result is that for full sentences, there is a combined five-way distinction of singular, dual, paucal, plural, and greater plural. Singular and plural have straightforward number agreements, whereas dual has dual pronouns but paucal articles, paucal has plural pronouns but paucal articles, and greater plural has greater plural pronouns but plural articles.

The exact meaning of and terminology for the greater plural differs between languages. In some languages like Miya, it represents a large number of something, and has been called the plural of abundance. In other languages like Kaytetye, it can refer to all of something in existence, and has been called the global plural.

Like some other grammatical numbers, languages also vary as to which cases the greater plural may be used in. The greater plural is more common in nouns than in pronouns. Accordingly, in Kaytetye, the greater plural exists only in nouns and not pronouns. Oppositely, Mokilese has the greater plural in pronouns but not nouns. Chamacoco has the greater plural only in first person inclusive pronouns, second person pronouns, and first person inclusive verb inflections. Tigre has the greater plural only in a single word, , which means a large number of deer.

===Greatest plural===

Greatest plural is a number larger than and beyond greater plural. It has also been called the &quot;even greater plural&quot;. For example, in Warekena:

* - &quot;dog&quot; (singular)
* - &quot;dogs&quot; (plural)
* - &quot;very many dogs&quot; (greater plural)
* - &quot;very many dogs indeed, so many one cannot count them&quot; (greatest plural)

A similar system is found in Banyun, where the greater plural represents unlimitedness, and the greatest plural represents &quot;a higher degree of unlimitedness&quot;.

Linguist Daniel Harbour has represented the paucal, greater paucal, plural, greater plural, and greatest plural as collectively definable by &quot;cuts&quot; that divide the range of possible numbers into different sections. One low cut defines paucal and plural, and one high cut defines plural and greater plural. Two low cuts define paucal, greater paucal, and plural; one low cut and one high cut define paucal, plural, and greater plural; and two high cuts define plural, greater plural, and greatest plural. There does not appear to be any language with three such cuts, and so no language with three paucal categories and an &quot;even greater paucal&quot;.

Because they are inexactly defined, the existence of multiple plural categories may blur the line between paucal and plural. For example, Mele-Fila is said to have a paucal, plural, and greater plural. However, the transition between plural and greater plural occurs around 15 to 20. This puts the Mele-Fila &quot;plural&quot; in range of some larger &quot;paucals&quot; described in other languages. Thus the distinction is muddied between a system of paucal, plural, greater plural, and a system of paucal, greater paucal, plural. Other examples can be found in the related languages of Northern Gumuz and Daatsʼiin. Northern Gumuz is said to mark the plural and greater plural on verbs, and Daatsʼiin is said to mark &quot;three degrees of plurality&quot; (plural, greater plural, and greatest plural) on verbs. In both languages though, the &quot;plural&quot; is often actually a paucal, understood to mean about two to four. However, in neither language is this always the case. The Northern Gumuz paucal/plural may sometimes refer to &quot;much greater than four&quot;.

===General, singulative, and plurative===
In some languages, the default form of a noun is not singular, but rather general, which does not specify number and could mean one or more than one. Singular and plural forms are marked from the general form. The general is used when the specific number is deemed irrelevant or unimportant. In this system, the singular is often called the singulative, to distinguish it as derived from a different form. Similarly, the plural derived from the general has been called the plurative. For example, in Pular:

* - &quot;dog(s)&quot; (general, any number)
* - &quot;dog&quot; (singulative)
* - &quot;dogs&quot; (plurative)

However, some languages only have a two-way difference between general and plurative, like in Japanese:

* () - &quot;dog(s)&quot; (general)
* () - &quot;dogs&quot; (plurative)

Less common is a two-way distinction between general and singulative. No language has this as its default number contrast, although some languages have specific nouns with this distinction. For example, in Sidama:

* - &quot;hyena(s)&quot; (general)
* - &quot;hyena&quot; (singulative)

In some languages like Afar, few nouns have a three-way contrast of general/singulative/plurative, but nouns with two-way contrasts of general/singulative and general/plurative are both common.

There are also languages which regularly employ different number systems with a dual, trial, paucal, or greater plural in addition to a general:

 

 



 

 



Additional other systems can be seen in some languages only for specific nouns:
*In Burushaski, for nouns that have the same form in the singular and the plural, the plural marker signifies a greater plural:
** - &quot;fish&quot; (general)
** - &quot;a quite large number of fish&quot; (greater plural)
*In addition to general, singulative, and paucal, some nouns in Hamer have an additional distinction that has been analyzed either as a greater plural or a collective plural. It seems to unambiguously be a greater plural in specific cases, such as:
** - &quot;Hamer person/people&quot; (general)
** (m) / (f) - &quot;Hamer person&quot; (singulative)
** - &quot;a few Hamer people&quot; (paucal)
** - &quot;all Hamer people&quot; (greater plural)
*Some dialects of Arabic have a few nouns that exhibit a five-way distinction of general, singulative, dual, plurative, and greater plural. In Damascus Arabic:
** - &quot;fly/flies&quot; (general)
** - &quot;fly&quot; (singulative)
** - &quot;two flies&quot; (dual)
** - &quot;flies&quot; (plurative)
** - &quot;many flies&quot; (greater plural)

===Minimal, unit augmented, and augmented===

Minimal, unit augmented, and augmented are a different set of number categories for pronouns in languages that grammatically treat a first person dual inclusive pronoun identically to singular pronouns, and a first person trial inclusive pronoun identically to dual pronouns. It is a relative paradigm that replaces the absolute paradigm of singular, dual, trial, and plural for languages where absolute classification is ill-fitting.

For example, under a singular/dual/trial/plural analysis, the pronouns in Ilocano and Bininj Kunwok are:

 
 

&quot;Singular&quot; does not exist for first person inclusive, which is by definition at least two people. In Ilocano, the &quot;dual&quot; &quot;only&quot; exists for first person inclusive, and likewise for the &quot;trial&quot; in Bininj Kunwok. Such categorization has been called &quot;inelegant.&quot; It can also poorly reflect the grammatical structure: using the suffix , Bininj Kunwok treats the first person inclusive &quot;trial&quot; identically to the &quot;duals&quot; in other persons, even though it refers to three people.

The alternate analysis is thus:

 
 

The &#x27;minimal&#x27; number is the smallest possible group for each category. For 1st exclusive, 2nd, and 3rd, this is one, and for 1st inclusive, this is two. Unit augmented is one more than minimal. For 1st exclusive, 2nd, and 3rd, this is two, and for 1st inclusive, this is three. Augmented is an equivalent to plural. In a minimal/augmented system, augmented means more than one for 1st exclusive, 2nd, and 3rd, and means more than two for 1st inclusive. In a minimal/unit augmented/augmented system, augmented means more than two for 1st exclusive, 2nd, and 3rd, and means more than three for 1st inclusive.

Besides Ilocano, languages considered to have a minimal/augmented pronoun system include Tagalog, Maranao, Maskelynes, and Ho-Chunk. The three-way distinction with the addition of unit augmented is mostly found in Australian Aboriginal languages, more specifically non-Pama-Nyungan languages. Among the very few languages outside Australia it applies to is the Austronesian language Äiwoo and the Trans–New Guinea language of Kunimaipa.

Minimal and augmented may also combine with paucal to create a three-way pronoun system of minimal, paucal, and augmented/plural. This is reportedly the case with Kayapo. A four-way system of minimal, unit augmented, paucal, and plural is theoretically possible, but has never been observed in any natural language.

===Composed numbers===

Composed numbers are number categories built from multiple number markers combined. They are &quot;a rare phenomenon.&quot;

====Dual and plural====

In Breton:

* - &quot;eye&quot; (singular)
* - &quot;two eyes&quot; (dual)
* - &quot;eyes&quot; (plural)
* - &quot;pairs of eyes&quot; (composed, dual + plural)

Breton only has the dual for nouns that naturally come in pairs, mostly body parts and items of clothing. The composed dual and plural indicates multiple sets of two each, whereas the regular plural represents multiple items without them conceptualized as coming in pairs. There is at least one attestation in Ancient Egyptian, from an inscription dating to the reign of Merneptah, of the exact same grammatical construction with the word &quot;hand&quot; (to mean multiple pairs of hands).

A similar category can be found in some nouns of Classical Arabic, where it has been called the &quot;dual of the plural&quot;. However, its meaning is the reverse of the Breton construction. Rather than multiple sets of two each, it indicates two sets of multiple each. Thus there is , spear (singular); , two spears (dual); , spears (plural); and , two groups of spears (dual of the plural). The Arabic dual of the plural more specifically implies a minimum of six items, or two groups of three each.

====Plural and plural====

In Breton and Classical Arabic, as well as in Somali and Maasai, some nouns may compose the plural with itself, to mean multiple different groups. This has been called the &quot;plural of the plural&quot;, the plural plural, or the double plural. An Arabic example is , dog (singular); , dogs (plural); and , groups of dogs (double plural). The Arabic double plural implies a minimum of nine items, or three groups of three each. Some Classical Arabic nouns may even compose the plural with itself yet again, to create the &quot;plural plural plural&quot; or triple plural, such as , sect (singular); , sects (plural); , groups of sects (double plural); and , groups of groups of sects (triple plural). The triple plural implies a minimum of 27 items. According to the 15th century linguist and polymath Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti, the Arabic word for male camel, , may be cumulatively pluralized up to six times: (plural), (double plural), (triple plural), (quadruple plural), (quintuple plural), and (sextuple plural).

===Conflated numbers===

Some number categories, formed from the combination of other existing categories, have only been attested as occurring secondarily alongside other grammatical number systems within a language. These have been called conflated numbers.

====Singular-dual====

A few languages have specific parts of speech that distinguish between two number categories: one or two, and more than two. The former category can be thought of as a single conflated singular-dual number. For example, in the nouns of Kalaw Lagaw Ya:

* - &quot;dog(s)&quot; (one or two)
* - &quot;dogs&quot; (plural, three or more)

The pronouns and verbs of Kalaw Lagaw Ya distinguish singular, dual, and plural, leaving no ambiguity between one and two in full sentences.

While Kalaw Lagaw Ya has the singular-dual in all nouns, Central Pame has it specifically in inanimate nouns, such as , spoon(s) (one or two), and , spoons (plural, three or more). Pame animate nouns largely have a full three-way distinction: , dog (singular); , two dogs (dual); and , dogs (plural). 

The singular-dual may also be found in verbs: Hopi verbs distinguish singular-dual and plural (3+), while Hopi pronouns distinguish singular and plural (2+). The dual can be represented with a plural pronoun combined with a singular-dual verb. This phenomenon has been called a constructed number or a Frankendual. However, Hopi nouns still overtly distinguish singular, dual, and plural. Idi goes even further by having no specific dual markers of any kind for any part of speech, with the only way to represent dual being combining a singular-dual verb with a plural noun. A more complex example comes from Koasati, where besides plural, some verbs have singular and dual, some verbs just have singular, and some verbs just have singular-dual:

====Singular-dual-trial====

In the Tucanoan language of Tuyuca, inanimate classifiers (which attach to nouns) distinguish one to three versus more than three:

* - &quot;banana(s)&quot; (one to three)
* - &quot;bananas&quot; (plural, four or more)

The related Tucanoan language of Wanano also has some nouns that function this way.

The same number distinction is also seen in the verb for &quot;climb&quot; in Miriwoong, an Australian language.

====Singular-dual-trial-quadral====

In Piratapuyo, closely related to Wanano, some nouns with inanimate classifiers distinguish between one and four versus more than four:

* - &quot;finger(s)&quot; (one to four)
* - &quot;fingers&quot; (plural, five or more)

====Singular-paucal====

Zuni, similarly to Hopi, shows a singular-dual versus plural distinction in its verbs, and a plural noun with a nonplural verb indicates dual. However, the opposite combination, a nonplural noun with a plural verb, is also possible, and can be variably interpreted as one, two, or a few. Zuni nouns have thus been described as having a &quot;singular-paucal&quot; versus plural distinction.

Some nouns in Navajo have also been described as working this way, such as:

* - &quot;fire(s)&quot; (one or several)
* - &quot;fires&quot; (many)

Similarly, although Larike pronouns exhibit singular, dual, trial, and plural, they can only be used for human referents. For nonhuman referents, there are only two possible numbers, which are marked on the verb: a plural, and a &quot;singular&quot; that can be used to mean anywhere from one to a few.

====Nondual====

The nondual number means any number except two. For example, in Wangkumara:

* - &quot;dog(s)&quot; (nondual, one or three or more than three)
* - &quot;two dogs&quot; (dual)

Wangkumara does not normally mark number directly on nouns. Instead, it distinguishes singular, dual, and plural using adnominal pronouns, plural-indicating adjectives like &#x27;many&#x27;, or marking on other adjectives. The exception is that nouns take the dual enclitic when referring to two. Thus for nouns alone, the only distinction is dual and nondual.

A more complex system can be found in the Tanoan languages of Kiowa and Jemez. These languages have what is called an inverse number system. Although the languages distinguish between singular, dual, and plural, any given noun only has a single possible number marker. What number is implicit in an unmarked noun depends on its class. In Kiowa, by default, Class I nouns are singular-dual, Class II nouns are plural (two or more), Class III nouns are dual, and Class IV nouns are mass nouns with no number. The inverse number marker changes the noun to whatever number(s) the unmarked noun isn&#x27;t, such as changing Class III nouns from dual to nondual. In Jemez, Class III nouns are the opposite: they are inherently nondual, and get marked for dual.

 
 

The nondual versus dual distinction may also be found in verbs. Timbisha has verbs with several different possible number distinctions, including nondual ones. A more minor example is Forest Enets, which has the nondual only in its intransitive third person imperative verbs.

The nondual violates a proposed universal of conflated systems, namely that they will always encompass every value except plural. Regardless, the nondual has still been referred to as a conflation of number values.

===Numberless languages===

A small number of languages have no grammatical number at all, even in pronouns. A well known example is Pirahã. Acehnese comes close, but appears to have a singular/plural distinction only in the first person pronouns.

===Summary of number systems===

==Distributives and collectives==

Distributives and collectives are two related categories whose inclusion in grammatical number has been contested. Both describe how members of a group are viewed, rather than how many members are in that group.

===Distributive plural===

The distributive plural denotes multiple entities that are separated and distinct, either in physical space, through time, or by type. For example, in Dagaare:

* - &quot;dog&quot; (singular)
* - &quot;dogs&quot; (plural)
* - &quot;dogs in different locations&quot; (distributive plural)

In Dagaare, the distributive plural may indicate either referents in different locations or referents of different types. By contrast, in Quileute, it only means referents in different locations, and in Mohawk, it only means referents of different types. Thus in Mohawk there is , towel, and , various products for wiping like towels, napkins, and so on. It is also possible to have distributive pronouns, such as those found in Yir-Yoront, which distinguish between &quot;you and I&quot; and &quot;you and I, acting separately&quot;.

However, it is most common to mark the distributive on verbs. This may distribute the action across various individuals, such as in the Paraguayan Guaraní constructions: , &quot;they dropped a pebble&quot;; , &quot;they each dropped a pebble&quot;. It may also distribute the action across time, such as in the Nêlêmwa words , to throw, and , to throw (repeatedly). Some ǂʼAmkoe verbs offer multiple senses of the distributive for one verb: , to stab; , to stab (repeatedly); , to stab (several things at different locations). The distributive plural may be a part of even larger paradigms: in Urarina, intransitive verbs describing a positional state (such as &quot;it is lying on its side&quot;) distinguish between singular, dual, paucal, plural (4+), and distributive plural.

While some linguists have treated the distributive as a category of grammatical number, others have rejected this. A few things make its categorization as a grammatical number potentially problematic. Several languages allow the distributive to be added to mass nouns that are normally not considered to have number, such as the Dagaare , gold, and , &quot;gold in different locations&quot;. This can be described as a nondistributive versus distributive distinction, with neither being singular or plural. Several languages also allow separate plural and distributive markers to be added to a word at the same time. Additionally, grammatical number frequently requires agreement, but distributivity does not.

===Collective plural===

The collective plural denotes multiple entities that are considered together as a unit. It is often conceptualized as the opposite of the distributive. For example, in Tunica:

* - &quot;dog&quot; (singular)
* - &quot;two dogs&quot; (dual)
* - &quot;dogs&quot; (plural)
* - &quot;pack of dogs&quot; (collective plural)

The collective may be limited to just a small subset of nouns, like in Kujireray, where it can only be used with certain insects and small objects: , fly; , flies; and , swarm of flies. Just like the distributive, the collective can also change the meaning of verbs, as in Panyjima: , to stand, and , to stand together. In Vaeakau-Taumako, the collective is indicated through different articles: , the person; , the people; and , the group of people.

The collective presents similar issues as the distributive in its potential classification as grammatical number, including the fact that some languages allow both collective and plural markers on the same words. Adding a collective to a plural word does not change the number of referents, only how those referents are conceptualized.

==Number in specific languages==
===Basque===
Basque declension has four grammatical numbers: indefinite, definite singular, definite plural, and definite close plural:

* The indefinite is used after the question words (&quot;What?&quot;), (&quot;Which?&quot;) and (&quot;How much? / How many?&quot;), after indefinite numerals, such as (&quot;some&quot;), (&quot;several&quot;), (&quot;so many / so much&quot;), (&quot;as much as / as many as&quot;), and before , (this one can go before nouns), , , , after (&quot;much, many, a lot, lots of, plenty of...&quot;), before (&quot;a few, little&quot;) and (&quot;some&quot;), and the numbers, if they do not refer to a defined amount: (&quot;What house[s] have you renewed?&quot;), (&quot;What houses have you renewed?&quot;). (&quot;In what house[s] were you living?&quot;). (&quot;How many houses have you got?&quot;). (&quot;The thieves have broken into a number of houses&quot;). (&quot;The thief has broken into so many houses!&quot;).

A noun followed by an adjective or a demonstrative is in the absolutive case, and the last word in the phrase is declined:
 (&quot;The house / House&quot;). (&quot;A house&quot;). (&quot;A big house&quot;). (&quot;In a big house&quot;). (&quot;That big house&quot;). (&quot;In that big white house&quot;).

If the amount is known, the plural grammatical numbers are used: (&quot;The thieves have broken in two houses&quot; [indefinite: the houses are unknown to the speakers]). (&quot;The thieves have broken in two or three houses&quot; [indefinite: the speakers does not know the exact amount of houses]). (&quot;The thieves have broken in both houses&quot; [definite plural: both are known to the speakers]). (&quot;The thieves have broken in these two houses&quot; [definite close plural: both are being shown by the speaker]).

The indefinite is also used in some idioms and set phrases: (&quot;Good day! / Good morning!&quot;), (&quot;Bon appetit!&quot;), (&quot;From house to house&quot;), (&quot;Go to the mass&quot;), (&quot;To look for a house&quot;), and as the root for compound words (, , &quot;Person or thing which brings loss to a home&quot;) or derivative words (, &quot;To go home / To send home&quot;; , &quot;fond of home&quot;; , &quot;housebuilder&quot;).

* The definite singular is used to designate a person or thing known or to present: (&quot;What is that building? It is my home&quot;). (&quot;The house is mine&quot;).
* The definite plural designates people or things known or present: (&quot;What are those buildings? They are my houses&quot;). (&quot;The houses are mine&quot;).
* The definite close plural refers to people or things which are in the vicinity of the speakers: (&quot;What are those buildings? They are my houses&quot;). (&quot;These houses are mine&quot;).

It is also used to include oneself in the group referred to: (&quot;The Navarrese like celebrations&quot;: the speaker is not a Navarrese). (&quot;We Navarrese like celebrations&quot;: the speaker is a Navarrese).

Verbs have four singular persons and three plural ones, as follows:

Singular:
* First person (the speaker): (&quot;I am Basque&quot;). (&quot;I have written the text&quot;).
* Informal second person (the person the speaker is addressing to, i.e., an inferior, an animal, a child, a monologue with oneself): (&quot;Thou art Basque&quot;). In some tenses, there are different verbs for a man or a woman: (&quot;Thou hast written the text [said to a man, a boy]&quot;, (&quot;Thou hast written the text [said to a woman, a girl]&quot;).
* Formal second person (the person the speaker is addressing to: a superior, somebody older, one&#x27;s parents), the most frequent one: (&quot;You [singular] are Basque&quot;). (&quot;You [sing.] have written the text&quot;).
* Third person (neither the speaker nor the listener): (&quot;He / She / It is big&quot;). (&quot;He / She / It has written the text&quot;).

Plural:
* First person (the speaker and somebody else at least): (&quot;We are Basque&quot;). (&quot;We have written the text&quot;).
* Second person (the addressees): (&quot;You [plural] are Basque [said to a group, either informally or formally]&quot;). (&quot;You [pl.] have written the text&quot;).
* Third person (more than one person outside the conversation): (&quot;They are big&quot;). (&quot;They have written the text&quot;).

===English===

English is typical of most world languages, in distinguishing only between singular and plural number. Singular corresponds to exactly one (or minus one), while plural applies to all other cases, including more and less than one or even 1.0. The plural form of a noun is usually created by adding the suffix &quot;-(e)s&quot;. The pronouns have irregular plurals, as in &quot;I&quot; versus &quot;we&quot;, because they are ancient and frequently used words going back to when English had a well developed system of declension. English verbs distinguish singular from plural number in the third person present tense (&quot;He goes&quot; versus &quot;They go&quot;). Old English also contained dual grammatical numbers; Modern English retains a few residual terms reflective of dual number (such as &quot;both&quot; and &quot;neither&quot;, as opposed to &quot;all&quot; and &quot;none&quot; respectively), but they are generally considered to no longer constitute a separate grammatical number.

===Finnish===

The Finnish language has a plural form of almost every noun case (except the comitative, which is formally only plural).
* – house
* – houses
* – in the houses

However, when a number is used, or a word signifying a number (monta- many), the singular version of the partitive case is used.
* – three houses

and where no specific number is mentioned, the plural version of the partitive case is used

and in the possessive (genitive)
* (the house&#x27;s door)
* (the houses&#x27; doors)

===French===
In modern Romance languages, nouns, adjectives and articles are declined according to number (singular or plural only). Verbs are conjugated for number as well as person. French treats zero as using the singular number, not the plural.

In its written form, French declines nouns for number (singular or plural). In speech, however, the majority of nouns (and adjectives) are not declined for number. The typical plural suffix, or , is silent, no longer indicating a change in pronunciation. Spoken number marking on the noun appears when liaison occurs.
* Some plurals do differ from the singular in pronunciation; for example, masculine singulars in sometimes form masculine plurals in .
* Proper nouns are not pluralized, even in writing. (, but )

Normally, the article or determiner is the primary spoken indicator of number.

===Hebrew===
In Modern Hebrew, a Semitic language, most nouns have only singular and plural forms, such as &quot;book&quot; and &quot;books&quot;, but some have distinct dual forms using a distinct dual suffix (largely nouns pertaining to numbers or time, such as &quot;two thousand&quot; and &quot;two weeks&quot;), some use this dual suffix for their regular plurals (largely body parts that tend to come in pairs, such as &quot;eyes&quot;, as well as some that do not, such as &quot;teeth&quot;), and some are inherently dual (such as &quot;pants&quot; and &quot;bicycle&quot;). Adjectives, verbs, and pronouns agree with their subjects&#x27; or antecedents&#x27; numbers, but only have a two-way distinction between singular and plural; dual nouns entail plural adjectives, verbs, and pronouns.

===Mortlockese===
The Mortlockese language of the Mortlock Islands uses a base 10 counting system. Pronouns, nouns and demonstratives are used exclusively in the singular and plural forms through the use of classifiers, suffixes and prefixes. There are no other dual or trial grammatical forms in the Mortlockese language. Different forms that can be used in the language include first person singular and plural words, second person singular words like , second person plural words like used to refer to an outside group, and third person plural words.

===Russian===
Modern Russian has a singular vs plural number system, but the declension of noun phrases containing numeral expressions follows complex rules. For example, (&quot;I have one book-&quot;nom. sing.&quot;/three book-&quot;gen. sing.&quot;/five book-&quot;gen. plur.&quot;&quot;). See Dual number: Slavic languages for a discussion of number phrases in Russian and other Slavic languages.

The numeral &quot;one&quot; also has a plural form used with pluralia tantum, as in , &quot;one clock&quot;. The same form is used with countable nouns in meaning &quot;only&quot;: &quot;There are only idiots around&quot;.

===Swedish===
Swedish inflects nouns in singular and plural. The plural of the noun is usually obtained by adding a suffix, according to the noun&#x27;s declension. The suffixes are as follows: in the 1st declension (e.g. – ), in the 2nd (e.g. – ), in the 3rd (e.g. – ), in the 4th (e.g. – ) and no inflectional suffix is added for the nouns in the 5th declension (e.g. – ). Verbs in Swedish do not distinguish singular from plural number, but adjectives do.

===Constructed languages===
Auxiliary languages often have fairly simple systems of grammatical number. In one of the most common schemes (found, for example, in Interlingua and Ido), nouns and pronouns distinguish between singular and plural, but not other numbers, and adjectives and verbs do not display any number agreement. In Esperanto, however, adjectives must agree in both number and case with the nouns that they qualify.

Láadan uses a singular-paucal-superplural breakdown, with paucal indicating between two and five items inclusive.

==Formal expression==
Synthetic languages typically distinguish grammatical number by inflection. (Analytic languages, such as Chinese, often do not mark grammatical number.)

Some languages have no marker for the plural in certain cases, e.g. Swedish – &quot;house, houses&quot; (but – &quot;the house&quot;, – &quot;the houses&quot;).

In most languages, the singular is formally unmarked, whereas the plural is marked in some way. Other languages, most notably the Bantu languages, mark both the singular and the plural, for instance Swahili (see example below). The third logical possibility, found in only a few languages such as Welsh and Sinhala, is an unmarked plural contrasting with marked singular. Below are some examples of number affixes for nouns (where the inflecting morphemes are underlined):

* Affixation (by adding or removing prefixes, suffixes, infixes, or circumfixes):
** Estonian: &quot;tree, wood&quot; (singular) – &quot;the trees, woods&quot; (nominative plural), or &quot;three trees&quot; (partitive singular)
** Finnish: &quot;cow, the cow&quot; (singular) – &quot;the cows&quot; (nominative plural)
** Turkish: &quot;the mountain&quot; (singular) – &quot;mountains&quot; (plural)
** Slovene: &quot;linden&quot; (singular) – &quot;linden&quot; (dual) – &quot;linden&quot; (plural)
** Sanskrit: &quot;man&quot; (singular) – &quot;two men&quot; (dual) – &quot;men&quot; (plural)
** Sinhala: &quot;flower&quot; (singular) – &quot;flowers&quot; (plural)
** Swahili: &quot;child&quot; (singular) – &quot;children&quot; (plural)
** Ganda: &quot;man&quot; (singular) – &quot;men&quot; (plural)
** Georgian: &quot;man&quot; (singular) – &quot;men&quot; (where &quot;-i&quot; is the nominative case marker)
** Welsh: &quot;children&quot; (collective) – &quot;child&quot; (singulative) 
** Barngarla: &quot;emu&quot; (singular) – &quot;two emus&quot; (dual) – &quot;emus&quot; (plural) – &quot;a lot of emus&quot; (greater plural)
* Simulfix (through various kinds of internal sound alternations):
** Arabic: &quot;book&quot; (singular) – &quot;books&quot; (plural)
** Welsh: &quot;birds&quot; (collective) - &quot;bird&quot; (singulative). The suffix which adds an extra syllable to the root word () causes the initial (and semantically empty) syllable to be dropped. The suffix also causes the same vowel affection as seen in the &quot;affixation&quot; type above and the &quot;apophony&quot; type below, changing the root vowel to . The same process can be seen in the pair &quot;sock&quot; and &quot;socks&quot; where the plural suffix causes the initial syllable () to be dropped.
* Apophony (alternating between different vowels):
** Dinka: &quot;frame&quot; – &quot;frames&quot;
** English: &quot;foot&quot; – &quot;feet&quot;
** German: &quot;mother&quot; – &quot;mothers&quot;
** Welsh: &quot;boy&quot; – &quot;boys&quot; 
* Reduplication (through doubling):
** Indonesian: &quot;person&quot; (singular) – &quot;people&quot; (plural); BUT &quot;two people&quot; and &quot;many people&quot; (reduplication is not done when the context is clear and when the plurality is not emphasized)
** Pipil: &quot;pot&quot; (singular) – &quot;pots&quot; (plural); similar to Indonesian, reduplication is omitted when plurality is marked elsewhere or not emphasized.
** Somali: &quot;book&quot; (singular) – &quot;books&quot; (plural)
* Suppletion (the use of the one word as the inflected form of another word):
** Serbo-Croatian: &quot;man&quot; (singular) – &quot;men, folks&quot; (plural)
** English: &quot;person&quot; (singular) - &quot;people&quot; (plural) 
* Tonality (by changing a drag tone to a push tone)
** Limburgish: &quot;day&quot; (singular) – &quot;days&quot; (plural)
** Ancient Greek: &quot;tongue&quot; (singular) – &quot;two tongues&quot; (dual)

Elements marking number may appear on nouns and pronouns in dependent-marking languages or on verbs and adjectives in head-marking languages.

In the English sentence above, the plural suffix &quot;-s&quot; is added to the noun &quot;cowboy&quot;. In the equivalent in Western Apache, a head-marking language, a plural affix is added to the verb &quot;he is teaching him&quot;, resulting in &quot;he is teaching them&quot; while noun &quot;cowboy&quot; is unmarked for number.

===Number particles===
Plurality is sometimes marked by a specialized number particle (or number word). This is frequent in Australian and Austronesian languages. An example from Tagalog is the word [mɐˈŋa]: compare &quot;house&quot; with &quot;houses&quot;. In Kapampangan, certain nouns optionally denote plurality by secondary stress: &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; become &quot;men&quot; and &quot;women&quot;.

===Classifiers with number morphology===
In Sanskrit and some other languages, number and case are fused categories and there is concord for number between a noun and its predicator. Some languages however (for example, Assamese) lack this feature.

Languages that show number inflection for a large enough corpus of nouns or allow them to combine directly with singular and plural numerals can be described as non-classifier languages. On the other hand, there are languages that obligatorily require a counter word or the so-called classifier for all nouns. For example, the category of number in Assamese is fused with the category of classifier, which always carries a definite/indefinite reading. The singularity or plurality of the noun is determined by the addition of the classifier suffix either to the noun or to the numeral. Number system in Assamese is either realized as numeral or as nominal inflection, but not both. Numerals [ek] &#x27;one&#x27; and [dui] &#x27;two&#x27;, can be realized as both free morpheme and clitics. When used with classifiers, these two numerals are cliticised to the classifiers.

Pingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. In Pingelapese, the meaning, use, or shape of an object can be expressed through the use of numerical classifiers. These classifiers combine a noun and a number that together can give more details about the object. There are at least five sets of numerical classifiers in Pingelapese. Each classifier has a numeral part and a classifier part that corresponds to the noun it is describing. The classifier follows the noun in a phrase. There is a separate set of numerical classifiers that is used when the object is not specified. Examples of this is the names of the days of the week.

===Obligatoriness of number marking===
In many languages, such as English, number is obligatorily expressed in every grammatical context. Some limit number expression to certain classes of nouns, such as animates or referentially prominent nouns (as with proximate forms in most Algonquian languages, opposed to referentially less prominent obviative forms). In others, such as Chinese and Japanese, number marking is not consistently applied to most nouns unless a distinction is needed or already present.

A very common situation is for plural number to not be marked if there is any other overt indication of number, as for example in Hungarian: &quot;flower&quot;; &quot;flowers&quot;; &quot;six flowers&quot;.

===Transnumeral===
Many languages, such as Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Malay (including Indonesian), particularly spoken in Southeast and East Asia, have optional number marking. In such cases, an unmarked noun is neither singular nor plural, but rather ambiguous as to number. This is called &quot;transnumeral&quot; or sometimes &quot;general number,&quot; abbreviated . In many such languages, number tends to be marked for definite and highly animate referents, most notably first-person pronouns.

==Number agreement== 

===Verbs===

In many languages, verbs are conjugated according to number. Using French as an example, one says (&quot;I see&quot;), but (&quot;we see&quot;). The verb (&quot;to see&quot;) changes from in the first person singular to in the plural. In everyday English, this often happens in the third person (&quot;she sees&quot;, &quot;they see&quot;), but not in other grammatical persons, except with the verb &quot;to be&quot;.
In English, and in Indo-European languages in general, the verb is singular or plural to match whether the subject of the sentence is singular or plural. Oppositely, in Xavante, transitive verbs match the number of the object. In West Greenlandic, the verb is marked for the number of both the subject and the object.

===Adjectives and determiners===
Adjectives often agree with the number of the noun they modify. For example, in French, one says &quot;a tall tree&quot;, but &quot;two tall trees&quot;. The singular adjective becomes in the plural, unlike English &quot;tall&quot;, which remains unchanged.

Determiners may agree with number. In English, the demonstratives &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot; change to &quot;these&quot;, &quot;those&quot; in the plural, and the indefinite article &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot; is either omitted or changes to &quot;some&quot;. In French and German, the definite articles have gender distinctions in the singular but not the plural. In Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, both definite and indefinite articles are inflected for gender and number, e.g. Portuguese &quot;the&quot; (singular, masc./fem.), &quot;the&quot; (plural, masc./fem.); &quot;a(n)&quot; (singular, masc./fem.), &quot;some&quot; (plural, masc./fem.), &quot;two&quot; (plural, masc./fem.).

In the Finnish sentence &quot;Nights are dark&quot;, each word referring to the plural noun &quot;nights&quot; (&quot;night&quot; = ) is pluralized (night- is- dark--partitive).

===Exceptions===

Sometimes, grammatical number will not represent the actual quantity, a form-meaning mismatch. For example, in Ancient Greek neuter plurals took a singular verb. The plural form of a pronoun may also be applied to a single individual as a sign of importance, respect or generality, as in the &quot;pluralis majestatis&quot;, the T–V distinction, and the generic &quot;you&quot;, found in many languages, or, in English, when using the singular &quot;they&quot; for gender-neutrality.

In Arabic, the plural of a non-human noun (one that refers to an animal or to an inanimate entity regardless of whether the noun is grammatically masculine or feminine in the singular) is treated as feminine singular—this is called the inanimate plural. For example:
: () &#x27;beautiful/handsome man&#x27;: (man) is masculine singular, so it takes the masculine singular adjective .
: () &#x27;beautiful house&#x27;: (house) is masculine singular, so it takes the masculine singular .
: () &#x27;beautiful dog&#x27;: (dog) is masculine singular, so it takes the masculine singular .
: () &#x27;beautiful girl&#x27;: is feminine singular, so it takes the feminine singular .
: () &#x27;beautiful car&#x27;: is feminine singular, so it takes the feminine singular .
: () &#x27;beautiful/handsome men&#x27;: (men) is masculine plural, so it takes the masculine plural .
: () &#x27;beautiful girls&#x27;: is feminine plural, so it takes the feminine plural .
but
: () &#x27;beautiful houses&#x27;: (houses) is non-human plural, and so takes the inanimate plural (feminine singular) .
: () &#x27;beautiful cars&#x27;: is non-human plural, and so takes the inanimate plural .
: () &#x27;beautiful dogs&#x27;: is non-human plural, and so takes the inanimate plural .

===Collective nouns===

A collective noun is a word that designates a group of objects or beings regarded as a whole, such as &quot;flock&quot;, &quot;team&quot;, or &quot;corporation&quot;. Although many languages treat collective nouns as singular, in others they may be interpreted as plural. In British English, phrases such as &quot;the committee are meeting&quot; are common (the so-called agreement &quot;in sensu&quot; &quot;in meaning&quot;; with the meaning of a noun, rather than with its form, see constructio ad sensum). The use of this type of construction varies with dialect and level of formality.

In some cases, the number marking on a verb with a collective subject may express the degree of collectivity of action:
* &quot;The committee are discussing the matter&quot; (the individual members are discussing the matter), but &quot;the committee has decided on the matter&quot; (the committee has acted as an indivisible body).
* &quot;The crowd is tearing down the fences&quot; (a crowd is doing something as a unit), but &quot;the crowd are cheering wildly&quot; (many individual members of the crowd are doing the same thing independently of each other).

==Semantic versus grammatical number==
All languages are able to specify the quantity of referents. They may do so by lexical means with words such as English &quot;a few&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;five hundred&quot;. However, not every language has a grammatical category of number. Grammatical number is expressed by morphological or syntactic means. That is, it is indicated by certain grammatical elements, such as through affixes or number words. Grammatical number may be thought of as the indication of semantic number through grammar.

Languages that express quantity only by lexical means lack a grammatical category of number. For instance, in Khmer, neither nouns nor verbs carry any grammatical information concerning number: such information can only be conveyed by lexical items such as &#x27;some&#x27;, &#x27;a few&#x27;, and so on.

<doc id="42297" wikidata="Q649768" url="?curid=42297" title="San Luis Valley">
<text>The San Luis Valley is a region in south-central Colorado with a small portion overlapping into New Mexico. The valley is approximately long and wide, extending from the Continental Divide on the northwest rim into New Mexico on the south. It contains 6 counties and portions of 3 others. It is an extensive high-elevation depositional basin of approximately with an average elevation of above sea level. The valley is a section of the Rio Grande Rift and is drained to the south by the Rio Grande, which rises in the San Juan Mountains to the west of the valley and flows south into New Mexico. The San Luis Valley has a cold desert climate but has substantial water resources from the Rio Grande and groundwater.

The San Luis Valley was ceded to the United States by Mexico following the Mexican–American War. Hispanic settlers began moving north and settling in the valley after the United States made a treaty with the Utes and established a fort in the early 1850s. Prior to the Mexican war the Spanish and Mexican governments had reserved the valley to the Utes. Later in the 19th century Anglo settlers began to settle in the valley and engaged in mining, ranching, and irrigated agriculture. Today the valley has a diverse Anglo and Hispanic population.

==History==
===Utes===
Prior to 1868 the Capote (Kapota) band of Ute Indians lived in the valley. The Utes made a treaty of peace with the United States in 1849 after the Mexican War. Shortly thereafter settlers from New Mexico established several small settlements in what is now Colorado and in 1868 the Utes were removed to a reservation in western Colorado. They continued to play a role in Saguache in the northwestern corner of the valley from the Los Pinos Agency to the west of Saguache until they lost their extensive reservation as the result of the Meeker Massacre in 1879.

===Spanish and Mexican administration===
The area was administered as part of the Spanish, later Mexican, province of Nuevo Mexico. In 1843, the government of New Mexico created the Sangre de Cristo Land Grant consisting of of the valley and granted the family of Carlos Beaubien. The area was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

===United States administration===
Extensive settlement began in the San Luis Valley, primarily by Hispanic farmers and ranchers from New Mexico, in the 1850s.
Early settlers built a church in the village that is now called San Luis and dedicated it on the Feast of Saint Louis, 21 June 1851.
At present, the San Luis Valley has the largest native Hispanic population in Colorado; many families are directly descended from the original New Mexican settlers.
The surge of immigration followed the construction by the U.S. Army of Fort Massachusetts for protection against the Utes, who had previously barred settlers. The history of the U.S. military presence in the valley is preserved at Fort Garland and other historic preserves in the valley.

The San Luis Valley became part of the Territory of Colorado in 1861.
The original Ute population was confined to the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Indian reservations in the late 19th century.

* Unlike the rest of Colorado, the United States surveyed the lands in the San Luis Valley using the New Mexico Meridian and Baseline.
* The San Luis Valley was one of eight candidate sites to detonate the first atomic bomb with White Sands Proving Ground ultimately selected for the Trinity nuclear test.
* The outlaw Felipe Espinosa operated in the San Luis Valley.

==Geography==
The San Luis Valley is the broad, generally flat, valley at the headwaters of the Rio Grande in south central Colorado and far north central New Mexico. The northern portion of the San Luis Valley is an endorheic basin; surface water does not exit this area. Irrigated agriculture is possible in the area due to groundwater and streams fed by the average 100 inches of snow the surrounding mountain ranges receive. The southern portion is drained by the Rio Grande.

There is no clear southern boundary but the term is generally used to include the San Luis Hills of southern Colorado and the Taos Plateau of northern New Mexico. About 50 miles from east to west and about 150 miles from north to south, the valley is bounded on the east by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and on the west by the San Juan Mountains.

Within Colorado the San Luis Valley is generally considered to comprise five Colorado counties: Saguache, Alamosa, Rio Grande, Conejos, and Costilla. The principal towns are: Alamosa, Monte Vista, Del Norte, South Fork, Saguache, Center, Moffat, Fort Garland, San Luis, Blanca, Antonito, La Jara, Capulin, Manassa, Sanford, Romeo, Crestone, Villa Grove, Hooper, Mosca, San Acacio and a number of smaller locations. A few other counties of Colorado have some land in the Rio Grande Basin including Archuleta, Mineral, Hinsdale, and San Juan.

Blanca Peak is prominent in the Sierra Blanca at the southern end of the northernmost section of the mountains, which is known as the Sangre de Cristo Range. There are several passes, with elevations between , giving access to the valley. North La Veta Pass, through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, is used by U.S. Highway 160 and by the Colorado Pacific Rio Grande Railroad (formerly a branch of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western) tracks. Other passes used historically were Medano, Mosca and Sangre de Cristo Passes.

The Great Sand Dunes are a famous feature of the valley. They lie directly to the west of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The dunes can reach high. The Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is now in place to protect both the dunes and the numerous archeological sites found in the area. The natural valley aquifer is close to the surface in this part of the valley, and helps with maintenance of water levels in the San Luis Lakes, just to the west of the sand dunes.

Elevation rises as you go north in the valley to Poncha Pass, used now by U.S. Highway 285 and historically by the narrow gauge tracks of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. Otto Mears, then of Saguache, built and operated a historic toll road over Poncha Pass at the north end of the valley into the San Luis Valley during Colorado&#x27;s 19th century mining era when the valley was the gateway to the San Juan and Gunnison country and the Ute agency was in the mountains west of Saguache. Mount Otto on the east side of the valley is named after him.

Cumbres Pass is a 10,015 ft. pass between Antonito, Colorado and Chama, New Mexico. The pass is traversed by State Highway 17 and the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad (originally built as the San Juan Extension of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad that ran to Durango, Colorado). From the headwaters of the Rio Grande Wolf Creek Pass is the route of U.S. Highway 160 between Del Norte, Colorado and Pagosa Springs, Colorado, while Spring Creek Pass is the route of State Highway 149 between U.S. Highway 160 and Lake City, Colorado. Stony Pass, sometimes spelled Stoney Pass, a historic wagon road to the mining camps of the San Juans, is now a jeep trail. At the north end of the valley, North Pass is the route of State Highway 114 between Saguache, Colorado and Gunnison, Colorado, bypassing the original route over Cochetopa Pass, now a county road.

The Rio Grande follows a course through the southern valley from Del Norte southeastward via Alamosa to New Mexico. South of Alamosa it is joined by several streams from the west including the Alamosa River and the Conejos River and Culebra Creek from the east. Most of the northern valley is an endorheic basin called the San Luis Closed Basin. Generally, within the Closed Basin the major streams such as Saguache Creek, San Luis Creek, and the streams from the west face of the Sangre de Cristos flow only a short distance onto the valley floor as surface streams. Only in very wet years, perhaps every 20 years, does the stream system in the Closed Basin flow as a contiguous unit into San Luis Lake at the low point of the Closed Basin west of the Great Sand Dunes.

===Land ownership and management===
About 50% of the in the San Luis Valley is privately owned. Much of the land in the south part of the Valley, in Conejos and Costilla counties, was originally part of large Mexican land grants and is private land.

 on the borders of the valley (generally adjacent to National Forest Lands) are managed by the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, a division of the United States Department of the Interior. This land is usually leased to neighboring ranches for grazing for a nominal fee. Part of the value of a ranch is its continuing lease of BLM or National Forest lands.

Public lands in the mountains surrounding the San Luis Valley are generally part of the Rio Grande National Forest and are managed by the United States Forest Service.

Large areas of private lands have either been subdivided into small &quot;ranch&quot; lots or have been sold or donated to the Federal government and make up portions of the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve, other wildlife preserves, and various state wildlife sites.

===Geology===
The San Luis Valley contains an alluvial basin, the Alamosa Basin, which lies at the north end of the Rio Grande rift. Deposits include the deeper alluvial strata, overlying Precambrian basement rock, Eocene alluvial deposits from a shallow Laramide depression, the Blanco Basin Formation; and Oligocene ash and lava flows associated with the Conejos Formation, is the Santa Fe formation, mixed alluvium and lava outflows from the San Juan volcanic field to the west; later strata comprise the Alamosa formation, alternating layers of sand, gravel, and clay. The relatively impermeable clay layers trap ground water in the &quot;confined aquifer&quot; which, if tapped, supplies artesian wells. Surface waters, including the Rio Grande and other streams, are hydrologically connected to the &quot;unconfined aquifer&quot; a shallow ground water formation which underlies much of the valley. The deeper confined aquifers have sufficient hydrological connection with the surface waters of the valley that they are not considered for the purposes of Colorado water law &quot;nontributary&quot; waters which could legally be mined. Streams which flow into the valley, particularly the Rio Grande, have deposited alluvial fans where they emerge from higher terrain onto the valley floor. 
====Ancestral Rockies, the Central Colorado Trough, and the San Luis-Uncompahgre Highlands====
The gap between the Precambrian basement rock and the Eocene alluvial deposits in the San Luis Valley is considered evidence that much of southern Colorado, including the western portion of the San Luis Valley, was highlands in the period prior to the Eocene Epoch, 56 to 34 million years ago. There were lowlands to the north in central Colorado, the Colorado sag, an east–west basin. It is from those highlands to the west, in Paleozoic, Pennsylvanian, and Permian times that the coarse alluvial deposits of the Sangre de Cristo Formation such as the Crestone Conglomerate originated. The Minturn Formation, a limestone formation exemplified at Marble Mountain on the crest of the Sangre de Cristos, is evidence of a sea in the Central Colorado Trough during the era of the Ancestral Rockies.

====Western Interior Seaway====
In the middle and late Cretaceous Period, about 100 million years ago, the San Luis Valley lay on the shore of or beneath the Western Interior Seaway, a shallow sea which divided North America into two parts. As the sea deepened and expanded sand and gravel eroded from mountains in the west was deposited in the Dakota Formation; later, when the sea was deeper mud and sand were deposited in the Mancos Shale. The Lexam oil play near Crestone is based on the hypothesis that there is oil trapped in Dakota Formation sandstones lying beneath Mancos Shale to the west of the Sangre de Cristo fault at the western base of the Sangre de Cristo Range southwest of Crestone. Drilling at the base of the range during gold exploration in the vicinity showed small amounts of oil and evidence of the existence of those formations as well as the underlying Morrison Formation. Prior to this discovery it was assumed that these formations had eroded away during the Laramide orogeny.

====Laramide orogeny====
Building of the Rocky Mountains by folding during the Laramide orogeny 80 to 55 million years ago created a highland, the San Luis-Brazos uplift, in the area of the San Luis Valley. This process over 30 million years resulted in an elevated and highly eroded peneplain where the San Luis Valley is today. There was a basin in its western portion which may have drained west through the course historically followed by the San Juan River. Sedimentary deposits formed in that basin during Eocene times remain in place beneath the western portion of the San Luis Valley. During the Pleistocene, parts of the valley were occupied by Lake Alamosa.

===Agriculture and wildlife===
Much of the land in the San Luis Valley is used for grazing. Farming is generally concentrated around the towns of Alamosa, Monte Vista and Center. Principal crops include potatoes, head lettuce, wheat, and barley. The barley grown here is the main supplier for Coors beer company. In 1982, quinoa was successfully grown for the first time outside of South America in the San Luis Valley of Colorado, and commercial growth has occurred since 1987. Less favored areas with a shorter growing season and less access to water rights tend to be devoted to alfalfa and grazing. Broad areas, especially in Saguache County, Colorado have a high water table or are even flooded part of the year. Uncultivated land is often covered with &quot;chico&quot;, low brush such as rabbitbrush, greasewood and other woody species. Cropland is typically irrigated with large ( mile radius) center-pivot irrigation systems, and a common feature of the Rio Grande Delta area where the Rio Grande enters the valley are large piles of potato-sized rocks screened from the soil.

The area supports a wide variety of wildlife. Sandhill cranes migrate through the valley every spring and fall. The Monte Vista Crane Festival takes place in March, centering on the Monte Vista National Wildlife Refuge located south of town. The valley is a flyway for many migrating birds including avocets, bald eagles, goldfinches, and a plethora of hawk species.

Agriculture in the San Luis Valley is enabled by irrigation, since average annual precipitation is just whereas most ag crop production requires at least twice that much water. Surface water rights in the Valley began to be allocated in 1852, with the People&#x27;s Ditch, near San Luis. In the 1870s, some of the San Luis Valley were irrigated, which rose to in the 1880s. By the early 1900s, demand for surface water had outstripped the available supply and farmers began to use subsurface wells to supply water. Over 5,000 groundwater wells existed by the time of World War I. By the early 1970s, water availability began to be limited, with the State enforcing a moratorium on new wells in much of the valley in 1972, and then completely ending new appropriations of water throughout the valley in 1981. The 1980s and 90s saw relatively bountiful water years in the valley, with drought conditions becoming the norm in the 2010s. , water use cutbacks are anticipated due to a court order requiring the restoration of 400,000 acre-feet of water to the groundwater aquifer, as well as the forecast for reduced Rio Grande flows in future years.

==Economy==
Predominantly agricultural in nature, the area is also one of the poorest rural areas of Colorado, with a poverty rate estimated at between 20 and 25% in 2019. The San Luis Valley Regional Medical Center is the largest employer in the valley, with over 600 employees.

Tourism has become a more important part of the economy in recent years, coupled with attempts to develop the area as a retirement destination. 
The arts are becoming an increasing force in expanding the economy of the San Luis Valley.

===Tourist attractions===
The San Luis Valley is home to the Great Sand Dunes National Park. The National Park is Open 24/7 year round. There are no timed entries or reservations to visit. The tallest dunes in North America are the centerpiece in a diverse landscape of grasslands, wetlands, forests, alpine lakes, and tundra. Stay on a moonless night to experience countless stars in this International Dark Sky Park.

Tourist attractions suggested by &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; include the Monte Vista Crane Festival in March, Los Caminos Antiguos, a regional road network, the Luther Bean Museum at Adams State University. Multiple Hot springs the Sand Dunes Swimming Pool Hot Spring and Joyful Journey Hot Springs. The Firedworks Gallery on Main Street in Alamosa for regional history and art, and regional Mexican food. Also recommended near Alamosa for wildlife viewing are The Alamosa Ranch north of town and the Alamosa National Wildlife Refuge to the southeast. To the northeast of Alamosa lie the San Luis Lakes State Wildlife Area, the San Luis Lakes and the Great Sand Dunes National Park

At Fort Garland, Colorado south of the Great Sand Dunes on U.S. Highway 160 the Fort Garland Museum is recommended and further south on State Highway 159 at San Luis, Colorado, the oldest town in Colorado, the bronze sculptures by Huberto Maestas, depicting the Stations of the Cross. From San Luis, the National Geographic road trip suggests traveling west on State Highway 142 through Manassa, Colorado, then south on U.S. Highway 285 past Conejos, Colorado then west on State Highway 17 over Cumbres Pass to Chama, New Mexico paralleling the route of the narrow gauge Cumbres &amp; Toltec Scenic Railroad.

Rock climbing and camping are available at Penitente Canyon and other locations. Rito Seco Park, located east of San Luis and named for a creek called Rito Seco, was established as a campground in the 1970s. However, it lacked hiking trails. Then in 2022, after more than a decade of planning, Costilla County and an organization called San Luis Valley Great Outdoors built three hiking trails and one single track mountain bike trail in the park.

The San Luis Valley is also home to the Colorado Gator Reptile Rescue. The Reptile rescue is open to the public to view and interact with many different types of reptiles from Gators to Tortoises. The rescue uses thermal hot springs water to maintain the gators through the winter months and is home to Morris the Movie Star Gator

===Art community===
There are over 500 known artists living in the San Luis Valley as evidenced by an ongoing directory maintained by Monte Vista artists&#x27; group, The Art Thing, The Art Thing&#x27;s membership boasts several nationally recognized artists working in various media. Monte Vista is also home to the Monte Arts Council as well as several festivals and an art tour that attracts artists from as far away as California and North Carolina. The arts of the San Luis Valley draw from traditions of the early Utes, Apaches, and Comanches and the later Spanish-speaking immigrants.

The San Luis Valley is home to five active live theaters, two at Adams State University, The Creede Repertory Theater, The Old Spanish Trails Theatre Company and Rocky Mountain Stage in Monte Vista. In August there are two major Music Festivals, the Spanish Trails Music Festival and Mexican Rodeo, and Rhythms on the Rio. Music in the valley is sponsored by the South Fork Music Association and the Alamosa Live Music Association.

===Solar energy===
The San Luis Valley is an alpine desert environment which is conducive to solar energy production. It has the highest per capita concentration of home-based solar energy systems in the United States. Colorado law requires that 30% of the power used in the state be generated from renewable sources by 2020. It also requires that 3% of the power generated be used at or near where it is generated; i.e. distributed generation.

There are also a number of utility-scale photovoltaic power stations in the valley, and an active market in selling or leasing land to be used for solar facilities. In 2007, SunEdison constructed the 7.7 megawatt Alamosa Photovoltaic Power Plant on about 80 acres near the town of Mosca, Colorado. It was the largest grid-connected solar electric facility in the United States at that time. It was followed in 2010 by the 19 megawatt Greater Sandhill Solar Plant, in 2011 by the 30 megawatt San Luis Valley Solar Ranch, in 2012 by the 30 megawatt Alamosa Solar Generating Project, and in 2015 by the 50 megawatt Hooper Solar PV Power Plant. All are located on previously developed agricultural lands near Mosca.

On 11 December 2009, more than 125 people gathered to respond to a proposal by Tessera Solar (affiliated with Stirling Energy Systems) to install 8,000 parabolic mirrors, 40 feet each, on near Saguache, Colorado. At issue was the noise expected to be generated by the numerous stirling engine generators, and the wisdom of industrial solar facilities in general. The application for a permit was withdrawn on 11 July 2011. There has also been controversy regarding proposed transmission lines over both Poncha and La Veta passes, which would open the door to much more industrial solar development. Opposition to a proposed transmission line has resulted in possible delays in development of solar facilities by Xcel Energy which together with Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association serves the valley. In 2012, the United States Department of Interior designated several Solar Energy Zones on BLM lands in the valley, although no projects have yet been announced to be in development.

==Demography==
A significant portion of the residents of the San Luis Valley are Hispanic with historic populations in Costilla and Conejos counties which were settled by early migrants from New Mexico. There are a few Native Americans in the valley. There are small Amish communities which were recently established.

Much of the grazing land on the floor of the valley is of little value. In Costilla County, large tracts of land have been subdivided into 5 acre plots. 35 acre plots are also common in the valley as a 35-acre plot allows drilling a well to water a garden and livestock. These have been sold to homesteaders who often live off-the-grid.

La Puente, headquartered in Alamosa offers social services to the homeless and others in the valley.

==Higher education==
Adams State University, a four-year state college at Alamosa, with approximately 3,500 students, is the major educational institution in the Valley. It is supplemented by a campus of Trinidad State College in Alamosa.

==Health==
San Luis Valley Regional Medical Center is a full service Acute-Care hospital and specialty physician clinic.

A locally conducted survey of public health statistics showed a considerable deficiency with respect to most measures of public health. There is a deficiency of medical providers, for example, 106 physicians per 100,000 compared to the Colorado average of 278.

<text>Tbilisi ( ; , ), in some languages still known by its pre-1936 name Tiflis ( ), ( ) is the capital and largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River. With around 1.2 million inhabitants, it contains almost one third of the country&#x27;s population. Tbilisi was founded in the fifth century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia and has since served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, it was the seat of the Caucasus Viceroyalty, governing both the northern and the southern sides of the Caucasus.

Because of its location at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history, Tbilisi has been a point of contention among various global powers. To this day, the city&#x27;s location ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. Tbilisi&#x27;s history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist, and Modern structures.

Historically, Tbilisi has been home to people of diverse cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, though its population is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian. Notable tourist destinations include cathedrals Sameba and Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress, the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National Museum. The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from in summer and in winter.

==Names and etymology==

The name &quot;Tbilisi&quot; derives from Old Georgian (Asomtavruli: , Mkhedruli: ), and further from (Modern Georgian: , warm, itself from Old Georgian: ). The name (the place of warmth) was therefore given to the city because of the area&#x27;s numerous sulfuric hot springs.

Until 1936, the name of the city in English and most other languages followed the Persian pronunciation Tiflis, while the Georgian name was ().

On 17 August 1936, by order of the Soviet leadership, the official Russian names of various cities were changed to more closely match the local language. In addition, the Georgian-language form was modernized on the basis of a proposal by Georgian linguists; the ancient Georgian component (, &#x27;warm&#x27;) was replaced by the newer (). That form was the basis for the new official Russian name ( ). Most other languages have subsequently adopted the new name form, but some languages, such as Turkish, Persian, Greek, Spanish, and German, have retained a variation of .

On 20 September 2006, the Georgian parliament held a ceremony celebrating the 70th anniversary of the renaming.

Some of the traditional names of Tbilisi in other languages of the region have different roots. The Ossetian name () derives from the Georgian word () meaning simply city. Chechen and Ingush names for the city use a form similar to or the same as their names for the country of Georgia ( ) as does the historical Kabardian name ( ), while Abkhaz () is from the Mingrelian ().

==History==

===Early history===
Archaeologists discovered evidence of continuous habitation of the Tbilisi suburb of Dighomi since the early Bronze Age, and stone artifacts dating to the Paleolithic age.

During the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, it was the largest settlement in the Caucasus. According to legend, the present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458. One widely accepted variant of the Tbilisi foundation myth states that King Vakhtang I of Iberia () went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon (sometimes the falcon is replaced with either a hawk or other small birds of prey in the legend). The king&#x27;s falcon allegedly caught or injured a pheasant during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died from burns. King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to clear the forest and build a city on the location.

King Dachi of Iberia (), the successor of Vakhtang I, moved the capital of Iberia from Mtskheta to Tbilisi and began construction of the fortress wall that lined the city&#x27;s new boundaries. From the sixth century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the region&#x27;s strategic location along with important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia.

===Foreign domination===
Tbilisi&#x27;s favorable trade location, however, did not necessarily bode well for its survival. Located strategically in the heart of the Caucasus between Europe and Asia, Tbilisi became an object of rivalry among the region&#x27;s various powers such as the Roman Empire, Parthia, Sassanid Persia, Muslim Arabs, the Byzantine Empire, and the Seljuk Turks. The cultural development of the city was somewhat dependent on who ruled the city at various times, although Tbilisi was fairly cosmopolitan.

From 570 to 580, the Persians ruled the city until 627, when Tbilisi was sacked by the Byzantine/Khazar armies and later, in 736–738, Arab armies entered the town under Marwan II. After this point, the Arabs established an emirate centered in Tbilisi. Arabic dirhams were brought to Georgia following the Arab conquest in the seventh century, and a mint was founded in Tbilisi that produced coins with inscriptions in both Arabic and Georgian. In 764, Tbilisi – still under Arab control – was once again sacked by the Khazars. In 853, the armies of Arab leader Bugha Al-Turki invaded Tbilisi in order to enforce its return to Abbasid allegiance. The Arab domination of Tbilisi continued until about 1050. In 1065, the Seljuk Sultan Alp Arslan campaigned against the Kingdom of Georgia, subjugated Tbilisi, and built a mosque in the city.

===Capital of Georgia===
In 1121, after the Battle of Didgori against the Seljuks, the troops of King David IV of Georgia besieged Tbilisi, taking it in 1122. David moved his residence from Kutaisi to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified Georgian State, thus inaugurating the Georgian Golden Age. From the 12–13th centuries, Tbilisi became a regional power with a thriving economy and astonishing cultural output. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 100,000. The city also became an important literary and cultural center, not only for Georgia, but also for the Eastern Orthodox world of the time. During Queen Tamar&#x27;s reign, Shota Rustaveli worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot;. This period is often referred to as &quot;Georgia&#x27;s Golden Age&quot; or the Georgian Renaissance.

===Mongol domination and other instability===
Tbilisi&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot; did not last for more than a century. In 1226, Tbilisi was captured by the Khwarezmian Empire under Shah Jalal al-Din, who massacred tens of thousands of Christians. The Khwarezmian occupation left Tbilisi&#x27;s defenses severely devastated and prone to further attacks by Mongol armies. In 1236, after suffering crushing Mongol defeats, Georgia submitted to Mongol domination. The nation itself maintained a form of &quot;semi-independence&quot; and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi would be strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century, both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols retreated from Georgia, and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state, once again. However, an outbreak of the Black Death struck the city in 1366.

Between the late 14th century and the late 18th century, Tbilisi would again be under the rule of various foreign powers. On several occasions, the city would even be completely burned and razed to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was invaded and sacked several times by the armies of Tamerlane. In 1440, the city was invaded and destroyed by Jahan Shah (the Shah of the town of Tabriz, Persia). From 1477 to 1478, the city was held by the Ak Koyunlu tribesmen of Uzun Hassan.

===Iranian control===


As early as the 1510s, Tbilisi (and the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) were made vassal territories of Safavid Iran. In 1522, Tbilisi was garrisoned for the first time by a large Safavid force. Following the death of king (&quot;shah&quot;) Ismail I (r. 1501–1524), king David X of Kartli expelled the Iranians. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. The four campaigns of the king Tahmasp I (r. 1524–1576) resulted in the reoccupation of Kartli and Kakheti, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tbilisi from 1551 onwards. With the 1555 Treaty of Amasya, and more firmly from 1614 to 1747, with brief intermissions, Tbilisi was an important city under Iranian rule, and it functioned as a seat of the Iranian vassal kings of Kartli whom the shah conferred with the title of vali. In 1718, the Venetian senate implored the Safavid emperor Soltan Hoseyn to protect the Catholic Armenians and Capuchin missionaries in Tbilisi from the Gregorian Armenians. Under the later rules of Teimuraz II and Heraclius II, Tbilisi became a vibrant political and cultural center free of foreign rule—but, fearful of the constant threat of invasion, Georgia&#x27;s rulers sought Russian protection in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk. Despite this agreement, the city was captured and devastated in 1795 by the Iranian Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, who sought to re-establish Iran&#x27;s traditional sovereignty over the region.

===Russian control===
In 1801, the Russian Empire annexed the Georgian Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (of which Tbilisi was the capital), later cementing its rule with the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, which ended Iranian control of Georgia. Within Tsarist Russia, Tbilisi (known then as Tiflis) was included within the Tiflis Uyezd county in 1801, and became the administrative center of the Tiflis Governorate (&quot;Gubernia&quot;) following the latter&#x27;s establishment in 1846. Russian Imperial administrators implemented a new European-style city plan and commissioned new buildings in Western styles. Roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in the Russian Empire, such as Batumi and Poti. By the 1850s, Tbilisi once again emerged as a major trade and cultural center. The likes of Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, Iakob Gogebashvili, Alexander Griboyedov and many other statesmen, poets and artists all found their home in Tbilisi. The city was visited on numerous occasions by and was the object of affection of Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov, the Romanov family and others. The main new artery built under Russian administration was Golovin Avenue (present-day Rustaveli Avenue), on which the Viceroys of the Caucasus established their residence. For much of the early 19th century, Tbilisi&#x27;s largest ethnic group was Armenian, at some point forming 74.3% of the population.

===Brief independence===
After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the city served as a location of the Transcaucasus interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent Transcaucasian Federation with the capital in Tbilisi. At this time, Tbilisi had roughly the same number of Armenians as Georgians, with Russians being the third largest ethnic group. It was in the former Viceroy of the Caucasus&#x27;s palace where the independence of three Transcaucasus nations – Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan – was declared by their respective national councils on 26 to 28 May 1918. After this, Tbilisi functioned as the capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until 25 February 1921. From 1918 to 1919, the city also consecutively served as the headquarters of the country&#x27;s German garrison and later the British 27th Division; Tbilisi was also the main office of the British Chief Commissioner in Transcaucasia, Oliver Wardrop and the High Commissioner to Armenia, Colonel William N. Haskell.

Under the national government, Tbilisi turned into the first Caucasian University City after the Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918. On 25 February 1921, the Bolshevist Russian 11th Red Army invaded Tbilisi and after bitter fighting at the outskirts of the city, declared Soviet rule.

===Soviet rule===

In 1921, the Democratic Republic of Georgia was occupied by the Soviet Bolshevik forces from Russia, and until 1936, Tbilisi functioned first as the capital city of the Transcaucasian SFSR (which included Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), and afterward until 1991 as the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. During Soviet rule, Tbilisi&#x27;s population grew significantly, the city became more industrialized, and it also came to be an important political, social, and cultural centre of the Soviet Union. In 1980, the city hosted the first state-sanctioned rock festival in the USSR. As a major tourist destination for both Soviet citizens and foreign visitors, Tbilisi&#x27;s &quot;Old Town&quot; (the neighborhoods within the original city walls) was reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s.

Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Russian demonstrations during 1956 in the 9 March Massacre, in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of Nikita Khrushchev. Peaceful protests occurred in 1978, and in 1989 the April 9 tragedy was a peaceful protest that turned violent.

===Post-independence===
Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief civil war, which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 to January 1992 (when pro-Gamsakhurdia and Opposition forces clashed), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations among various mafia clans and illegal business operators. During the Shevardnadze Era (1992–2003), crime and corruption were rampant. Many segments of society became impoverished because of unemployment caused by the crumbling economy. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified parliamentary elections forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the Rose Revolution. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability with decreasing crime rates, an improved economy, and a real estate boom. During the 2008 South Ossetia war, the Tbilisi area was hit by multiple Russian air attacks.

After the war, several large-scale projects were started, including a streetcar system, a railway bypass and a relocation of the central station, and new urban highways. In June 2015, a flood killed at least twenty people and caused animals from the city&#x27;s zoo to be released into the streets.

==Politics and administration==
The status of Tbilisi, as the nation&#x27;s capital, is defined by Article 10 of the Constitution of Georgia (1995) and the &quot;Law on Georgia&#x27;s Capital – Tbilisi&quot; (20 February 1998).

Tbilisi is governed by the Tbilisi City Assembly (Sakrebulo) and the Tbilisi City Hall (Meria). The City Assembly and mayor are elected once every four years by direct elections. The Mayor of Tbilisi is Kakha Kaladze and the Chairman of the Tbilisi city Assembly is Giorgi Alibegashvili.
Administratively, the city is divided into raions (districts), which have their own units of central and local government with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. This subdivision was established under Soviet rule in the 1930s, following the general subdivision of the Soviet Union. After Georgia regained independence, the raion system was modified and reshuffled. According to the latest revision, Tbilisi raions include:
* Mtatsminda District, including neighborhoods: Mtatsminda, Sololaki, Vera, Kiketi, Kojori, Shindisi, Tsavkisi, Tabakhmela, Okrokana
* Vake District, including neighborhoods: Vake, Bagebi, Upper Saburtalo, Nutsubidze Plateau, Tskneti
* Saburtalo District, including neighborhoods: Lower Saburtalo, Vedzisi, Vashlijvari, Didi Dighomi, Patara Dighomi, Zurgovana
* Krtsanisi District, including neighborhoods: Abanotubani, Kala, Ortachala, Ponichala
* Isani District, including neighborhoods: Avlabari, Isani, Navtlughi, Metromsheni, Vazisubani
* Samgori District, including neighborhoods: Varketili, Orkhevi, Dampalo, Lilo, Lower Samgori, Africa
* Chughureti District, including neighborhoods: Chughureti, Ivertubani, Kukia, Svanetisubani
* Didube District, including neighborhoods: Didube, Dighomi Massive
* Nadzaladevi District, including neighborhoods: Nadzaladevi, Sanzona, Temka, Lotkini
* Gldani District, including neighborhoods: Gldani, Avchala, Mukhiani, Gldanula

Most of the raions are named after historic quarters of the city. The citizens of Tbilisi widely recognize an informal system of smaller historic neighborhoods. Such neighborhoods are several, however, constituting a kind of hierarchy, because most of them have lost their distinctive topographic limits. The natural first level of subdivision of the city is into the right and left banks of the Mtkvari river.

The names of the oldest neighborhoods go back to the early Middle Ages and sometimes pose a great linguistic interest. The newest whole-built developments bear chiefly residential marketing names.

In 19th-century Tbilisi, the Georgian quarter was confined to the southeastern part of the city; Baedeker describes the layout succinctly:

==Geography==

===Location===
Tbilisi is located in the South Caucasus at 41° 43&#x27; North and 44° 47&#x27; East. The city lies in Eastern Georgia on both banks of the Kura River (locally known as Mtkvari). The elevation of the city ranges from and has the shape of an amphitheatre surrounded by mountains on three sides. To the north, Tbilisi is bounded by the Saguramo Range, to the east and south-east by the Iori Plain, to the south and west by various endings (subranges) of the Trialeti Range.

The relief of Tbilisi is complex. The part of the city which lies on the left bank of the Kura River extends for more than from the Avchala District to River Lochini. The part of the city which lies on the right side of the river, though, is built along the foothills of the Trialeti Range, the slopes of which in many cases descend all the way to the edges of the river. The mountains, therefore, are a significant barrier to urban development on its right bank. This type of a geographic environment creates pockets of very densely developed areas, while other parts of the city are left undeveloped due to the complex topographic relief.

To the north of the city, a large reservoir (commonly known as the Tbilisi Sea) is fed by irrigation canals.

===Climate===

Tbilisi has a humid temperate climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa,&quot; Trewartha: &quot;Do&quot;) with considerable continental and semi-arid influences. The city experiences hot, humid summers and moderately cold dry winters. Like other regions of Georgia, Tbilisi receives significant rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry period. The city&#x27;s climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and oceanic (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountains Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild microclimate compared to other cities that possess a similar climate along the same latitudes.

The average annual temperature in Tbilisi is . January is the coldest month with an average temperature of . July is the hottest month with an average temperature of . Daytime high temperatures reach or exceed on an average of 22 days during a typical year. The absolute minimum recorded temperature is in January 1883 and the absolute maximum is on 17 July 1882. Average annual precipitation is . May is the wettest month (averaging of precipitation) while January is the driest (averaging of precipitation). Snow falls on average 15–25 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city, mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.

==Demographics==

===Population===


As a multiethnic city, Tbilisi is home to more than 100 ethnic groups. Around 90% of the population consists of ethnic Georgians, with significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Armenians, Russians, and Azerbaijanis. Along with the above-mentioned groups, Tbilisi is home to other ethnic groups including Ossetians, Abkhazians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Jews, Assyrians, Yazidis, and others.

===Religion===

More than 95% of the residents of Tbilisi practise some form of Christianity (the most predominant of which is the Georgian Orthodox Church). The Russian Orthodox Church, which is in full communion with the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church have significant followings as well. A minority of the population (around 1.5%) practises Islam (mainly Shia Islam), while about 0.1% of Tbilisi&#x27;s population practises Judaism. Also, a Roman Catholic church and the Yazidi Sultan Ezid Temple can be found in the city.

==Sports==

Until the beginning of the 19th century, sports such as horse-riding (polo in particular), wrestling, boxing, and marksmanship were the most popular city sports. Influence from the Russian Empire brought more Western sports and activities (billiards, fencing) to Tbilisi.

The Soviet period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in Europe and, to a certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary infrastructure for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including, among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic-sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 handball arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the Dinamo Arena (55,000 seats) and the second-largest is the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium (24,680 seats). The Sports Palace, which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments, can seat about 11,000 people. Vere Basketball Hall is a smaller indoor sports arena with a seating capacity of 2,500.

Football is the most popular sport in Tbilisi, followed by rugby and basketball. Other popular sports include wrestling, tennis, swimming, and water polo. It has several professional football and rugby teams, as well as wrestling clubs. U.S. National Basketball Association players Zaza Pachulia and Nikoloz Tskitishvili are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of intercollegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.

Tbilisi&#x27;s signature football club, Dinamo Tbilisi, has not won a major European championship since the 1980–1981 season, when it won the European UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the Euroleague in 1962, but also never repeated any such feat.

Tbilisi hosted Group A matches for the EuroBasket 2022 at the new 10,000-seat Tbilisi Arena (next to the Olympic Palace), as one of the tournament co-hosts alongside Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Berlin, Cologne), and Italy (Milan).

==Media==
The large majority of Georgia&#x27;s media companies (including television, newspaper, and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular television channels Rustavi 2, Imedi, TV Pirveli, Mtavari Arkhi, Formula, Maestro, and the Public Broadcasting Channel, among others. Tbilisi&#x27;s television market has experienced notable changes since 2019, when changes in the ownership of Rustavi 2 prompted many of its employees to leave and partake in the creation of new television channels, namely Mtavari Arkhi and TV Formula.

Tbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily &quot;24 Saati&quot; (&quot;24 Hours&quot;), &quot;Rezonansi&quot; (&quot;Resonance&quot;), &quot;Alia&quot;, the English-language daily &quot;The Messenger&quot;, weekly &quot;FINANCIAL, Georgia Today&quot;, and the English-language weekly &quot;The Georgian Times&quot;. Out of the city&#x27;s radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9 FM), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the most influential competitors with large national audiences.

Radio stations in Tbilisi include 5 Lines Radio (93.8 FM), Europe +Tbilisi (99.6 FM), and Georgian Patriarchy Radio (105.4 FM).

==Culture==
===Architecture===

The architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian) and Byzantine, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Beaux-Arts, Middle Eastern, and Soviet modern styles. Very few buildings survived the destruction of the city in 1795, so most historical buildings in Tbilisi date to the Russian Imperial period (1801–1917). The oldest parts of the city (Kala, Abanotubani, Avlabari) were largely rebuilt on their medieval street plans, and some old houses were even rebuilt on much older foundations. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were developed according to a European-style plan by Russian authorities (Sololaki, Rustaveli Avenue, Vera, etc.) have a Western appearance, with a mix of styles popular in Europe at the time: Beaux Arts, Orientalist, and various period revival styles.

Tbilisi is most notable for its abundance of Art Nouveau buildings and details (common in Sololaki and Chughureti), which flourished from the mid-1890s to through the end of Russian rule. Art Nouveau was decreed as bourgeois by communist authorities, who introduced experimental modern architecture. The more conservative and historically inflected Stalinist architecture in Georgia is embodied by the 1938 Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute building (&quot;Imeli&quot;), now housing the Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi.
Tbilisi&#x27;s postwar architecture is similar to the brand of midcentury modernism found across the Soviet Union. The city expanded dramatically in response to a housing crisis after World War II. Entire neighborhoods (Saburtalo, Dighomi) appeared on the outskirts of the city in a matter of decades, built with advances in mass-production technology. Georgian architects produced some of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most interesting architectural achievements, including Tbilisi&#x27;s 1975 Ministry of Roads and the 1984 Wedding Palace. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the urban landscape is largely characterized by unregulated construction. New towers occupy formerly public spaces and overcrowded apartment buildings sprout &quot;kamikaze loggia&quot; overnight. Since 2004, the city government has taken initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. Tbilisi now has several skyscraper complexes, such as the Axis Towers, Hilton Garden Inn Tbilisi Chavchavadze, Holiday Inn Tbilisi, and King David Residences.

===Art museums and galleries===
The Georgian National Museum gathers several important museums, including the Art Museum of Georgia. The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 2012. Two independent contemporary art organizations, Kunsthalle Tbilisi and Open Space of Experimental Art, were founded in 2018. Among many other museums, there are the Giorgi Leonidze State Museum of Literature and the Writer&#x27;s House of Georgia.

===Performing arts===

The city has important theatre and music institutions, such as the Tbilisi State Conservatoire, the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre, the Shota Rustaveli State Academic Theatre, Marjanishvili State Academic Theatre, Rezo Gabriadze Marionette Theatre and Royal District Theatre.

====Film Festival====

The Tbilisi International Film Festival (TIFF) is hosted by the Cinema Art Center, Prometheus. It was first held in 2000, within a larger framework of festivals called Gift, until the Prometheus centre was established in 2002, after which it has been held there. It is located at 164 Agmashenebeli Avenue.

=== World Book Capital ===
Tbilisi was designated as the World Book Capital for 2021 by UNESCO.

==Tourism==
Georgia&#x27;s growing popularity as an international tourist destination has put Tbilisi on the global travel map. With the country hosting more than 9 million international visitors in 2019, the capital saw major investments in the hospitality industry. It now is the leading tourist destination in the region, offering exquisite cityscapes, Art Deco, Russian, Eastern and Soviet architecture, national museums and galleries, cultural attractions, festivals, historical landmarks and exceptional, traditional Georgian cuisine along with a wide range of international restaurants. The city is well-known, due to its complicated history, as a melting pot of cultures, a diverse metropolis with a palette of attractions.

===Main sights===


Tbilisi has important landmarks and sightseeing locations. The Parliament and the government (State Chancellery) buildings of Georgia, the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Sameba Cathedral, the Vorontsov&#x27;s Palace (also known as the Children&#x27;s Palace today), the National Public Library of the Parliament of Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia, Tbilisi Circus, The Bridge of Peace, and many state museums are in Tbilisi. During the Soviet times, Tbilisi continuously ranked in the top four cities in the Soviet Union for the number of museums.

Out of the city&#x27;s historic landmarks, the most notable are the Narikala fortress (4th–17th century), Anchiskhati Basilica (6th century, built up in the 16th century), Sioni Cathedral (8th century, later rebuilt), and Church of Metekhi, Open Air Museum of Ethnography, Sulfur Bath, and Tbilisi Old City.

===Nightlife===
Beyond traditional attractions, Tbilisi has developed burgeoning nightclub culture which started to attract international media attention in the 2010s. The leading clubs such as Bassiani, Mtkvarze, Khidi, and Café Gallery have featured major international DJs as well as local performers. Due to the growing queer nightlife scene the city is also home to several underground LGBTQ+ venues.

==Economy==

With a nominal GDP of 32 billion Georgian lari (€10 billion) in 2022, Tbilisi is the economic center of the country, generating more than half of Georgia&#x27;s GDP. Its GDP per capita of 26,769 Georgian lari (€8,700) is exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent. The service sector itself is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, reflecting the role of Tbilisi as transit and logistics hub for the country and the South Caucasus. The manufacturing sector contributes only 12 percent to Tbilisi&#x27;s GDP, but is much larger, by employment and total value added, than the manufacturing sectors in any other region of Georgia. The unemployment rate in Tbilisi is – with 22.5 percent – significantly higher in Tbilisi than in the regions.

==Transport==

The public transport system and the relevant infrastructure in Tbilisi is primarily managed by the Transport and Urban Development Agency. After decades of poor transport services and the prioritization of private vehicles, the city has invested heavily in developing a green, extensive and diverse public transit network since the 2010s. Today, the city is served by an international airport, metro and national rail services, municipal buses, minibuses, cabs, cable cars, bike lanes and a funicular.

===Airport===

Shota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport is Tbilisi&#x27;s only international airport, located about southeast of the city center. Handling 2.99 million passengers in 2022, it is the busiest airport in Georgia and the twentieth busiest airport in the former Soviet Union. The airport has been rapidly growing over the past decade, handling more than 3.56 million passengers in 11 months of 2018. It is a hub for the national carrier Georgian Airways and Georgian-Chinese start-up Myway Airlines. 
Various international carriers serve routes to major European and Asian hubs, such as London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dubai, Brussels, Milan, Vienna, Paris, and Doha. The Irish ultra-low-cost carrier Ryanair started operating from the airport in 2019.

Tbilisi International Airport in 2016 started to utilize solar energy and became the first &quot;green airport&quot; in the Caucasus region in 2008.

Natakhtari Airfield, located 33 km north of Tbilisi in the town of Natakhtari, is a domestic airport serving the capital on routes to Batumi, Mestia and Ambrolauri.

===Metro===


The Tbilisi Metro serves the city with rapid transit subway services. More than 400,000 journeys are made on the system every single day. It was the Soviet Union&#x27;s fourth metro system. Construction began in 1952 and was finished in 1966. The system operates two lines, the Akhmeteli-Varketili Line and the Saburtalo Line. It has 23 stations and 186 metro cars. Most stations, characteristic to Soviet-built metro systems, are extravagantly decorated. Trains run from 6:00 am to midnight. Due to the uneven ground, the rail lines run above ground in some areas. Two of the stations are above ground.

In 2020, it was announced by the city government that the metro system is set for a major upgrade with the renovation of all stations, targeting more sustainable and modern design, as well as step-free wheelchair accessibility. Moreover, Tbilisi will purchase 40 new, modern train cars, or 10 trains, becoming the first major rolling stock upgrade in the network&#x27;s more than 50-year-old history.

The third overground line is planned to connect central Tbilisi with suburbs and Tbilisi International Airport with a possible extension to Rustavi, 30 km east of Tbilisi.

===Rail===
Tbilisi is the busiest intersection of Georgian Railways services, primarily centred within Tbilisi Central Railway Station. From there, the national rail operator offers inter-city services to Batumi, Zugdidi, Poti, Ozurgeti, Kutaisi and other large cities, as well as several suburban rail services.

===Buses===
Tbilisi&#x27;s bus network forms a crucial backbone of the city&#x27;s transit system. For almost a decade, up to 700 outdated buses of various size were serving the city, majority of them were Ukrainian Bogdan A144 and A092 models. Nowadays the city has an extensive network of municipal buses, including a growing number of night bus services. In August 2020, the mayor of Tbilisi Kakha Kaladze announced major changes in the existing public transit system. Notably, the city will have 10 Bus Rapid Transit corridors in the near future, served by large 18-meter-long buses running at significantly shorter intervals. These services are named TBT (Tbilisi Bus Transit) lines and are indexed numbers from 300 until 310. Besides the TBT lines, the new system includes 44 city and 185 local lines, totalling up to over 240 bus routes within the city.

The initial reorganization of the bus network started in 2016 when then-mayor Davit Narmania started an ambitious project in efforts to revamp the outdated fleet. Under his city government, 143 energy-efficient MAN Lion&#x27;s City buses were purchased and delivered in 2017. Later, in 2018, a tender was announced to order 90 new buses. Tegeta Truck &amp; Bus won the tender and delivered 90 Man Lion&#x27;s City low floor buses to the city in early 2019. Later on, the city purchased more than 400 new buses from two different manufacturers, including 12-meter-long, low floor BMC vehicles and shorter, 8.5-meter-long Isuzu city buses. It was also announced that the city will buy 200 18-meter-long articulated buses in the near future in hopes of further expanding the city&#x27;s bus network and decreasing intervals.

===Cycling===
Cycling has become increasingly popular among the residents of Tbilisi over the past few years. For decades, this green mode of transport was seen unfit for the mountainous and uneven terrain of the city. However, as the city&#x27;s government started introducing new bike lanes across the city, a rising number of people turned towards bikes for regular use. One of the first major central Tbilisi bike lanes opened along Pekini Avenue in 2017, following a long rehabilitation process. The 2.8 meter wide lane failed to attract regular users amid the lack of a greater, city-wide network. Soon the city unveiled more bike lanes, including within recreational areas, such as the National Botanical Garden of Georgia and Lisi Lake.

The expansion of the city&#x27;s cycling infrastructure network was significantly accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic as cities across the globe started organizing pop-up bike lanes. Tbilisi joined the global trend, unveiling cycling lanes in city&#x27;s central areas, such as Vake, Vera and the bank of the Kura River. Following these changes, the total length of Tbilisi&#x27;s bike lanes increased from 2 km in 2019 to over 20 km in 2020. The head of the city&#x27;s transport department told Euronews Georgia that Tbilisi is working on a 20-year long urban mobility development strategy. According to the plan, the total length of the bike lane network will eventually reach 350 km across the capital.

===Tram===

Tbilisi had a tram network starting in 1883 with horse-driven trams, followed by electric trams in 1904. After the Soviet Union disintegrated, due to electricity deficit the electric transport went into decline, and finally the only tram line left was closed on 4 December 2006, along with the two remaining trolleybus lines. There were plans to construct a modern tram network.

===Minibus===
For a long time, the most dominant form of transport was the minibus network. An elaborate minibus system grew in Tbilisi over the early 2000s. Amid the lack of public funding and rundown infrastructure, minibuses emerged as a private initiative and a short-term solution to the city&#x27;s transportation problem. In 2019, the company operating yellow minibuses in Tbilisi was asked to replace the entire fleet by the end of 2020. However, the process was slowed down and only 300 minibuses were replaced. The mayor of Tbilisi announced that the number of minibuses in Tbilisi will gradually decrease, eventually vanishing from Tbilisi&#x27;s streets.

In addition to the city, several lines also serve the surrounding countryside of Tbilisi. Throughout the city, a fixed price is paid regardless of the distance (80 or 50 tetri in 2018). For longer trips outside the city, higher fares are common. As of April 2018, there are no predefined stops for the minibus lines, except 14 streets; they are hailed from the streets like taxis and each passenger can exit whenever they prefer.

===Aerial tramways===
Historically, the city had seven different aerial tramways, but many of them closed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Since 2012, a gondola lift has operated between Rike Park and the Narikala fortress; each gondola can carry up to eight people. The system was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner Ropeways.

On 12 October 2016, the Turtle Lake aerial tramway (originally opened in 1965) reopened after seven years out of service. It underwent major reconstruction but kept the old designs of gondolas and stations. This tramway connects Vake Park with Turtle Lake.

On 19 April 2021, another Soviet-era aerial tramway between the State University (Maglivi) and the University Campus (Bagebi) in Saburtalo District (originally opened in 1982) was opened after reconstruction works took place in 2016–2018. The original Italian cabins, produced by Lovisolo and provided by Ceretti &amp; Tanfani, with a capacity of 40 passengers each, were kept, as were the stations.

In 1990, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the 1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident and remaining closed ever since. Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.

===Funicular===

The Tbilisi funicular reopened in 2012 after a multi-year closure. It is a ropeway railway first built in 1905, connecting Chonkadze Street and Mtatsminda Park, and covering almost in altitude difference. The top of the hill is the highest point of the city, offering many different views of Tbilisi, and is home to the Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower as well as some amusement rides, including a rollercoaster and a ferris wheel.

The half-way station of the funicular is located near the Mtatsminda Pantheon, providing easy access to the necropolis.

==Education==
Tbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education, including the Tbilisi State Medical University and the Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, famous for their internationally recognized medical education systems. The biggest Georgian university is Tbilisi State University (TSU), which was established on 8 February 1918. TSU is the oldest university in the whole Caucasus region, with up to 25,000 students enrolled and approximately 5,000 faculty members and staff (collaborators). Tbilisi is also home to the largest medical university in the Caucasus region – Tbilisi State Medical University, which was founded as the Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918 and became the Faculty of Medicine within the Tbilisi State University in 1930. Tbilisi State Medical Institute was renamed to Medical University in 1992. Since it operates as an independent educational institution, it has become one of the highest-ranking state-supported institutions of higher education in the Caucasus region. As of 2023, there are over 7,000 undergraduate and 3,000 postgraduate students at the university, of whom about a quarter come from foreign countries.

Georgia&#x27;s main and largest technical university, Georgian Technical University, is in Tbilisi. It was founded in 1922 as a polytechnic faculty of the Tbilisi State University. The first lecture was read by world-famous Georgian mathematician Professor Andria Razmadze. It was transformed into an independent institute in 1928, until it was finally granted University status in 1990.

Three of the most popular private higher educational institutions in Georgia – The University of Georgia (Tbilisi), Caucasus University, and the Free University of Tbilisi – are in Tbilisi. The University of Georgia (Tbilisi) is the largest private University in Georgia, with more than 8,000 international and local students. Soon after its establishment, it became a market leader within the Georgian educational sector. In 2010, the UG received financing from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) for the development of the university&#x27;s infrastructure and technical equipment. The University of Georgia has various undergraduate and graduate programs, and it was the first Georgian university to offer international certificate programs of the Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Zend Technologies and Cisco Academy.

Caucasus University was established in 2004 as an expansion of the Caucasus School of Business (CSB, established in 1998) by a consortium consisting of Tbilisi State University and Georgian Technical University in partnership with Georgia State University (Atlanta, USA).

The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through a merger of two higher education schools: the European School of Management (ESM-Tbilisi) and the Tbilisi Institute of Asia and Africa (TIAA), both of which then became schools within the university. Aside from that, the Free University now comprises six other schools — Law School, Governance and Social Sciences, Visual Arts and Design (VAADS), Mathematics and Computer Science (MACS), Physics, and Doctoral School in Social and Humanitarian Sciences — that deliver academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctorate levels. In addition, Free University conducts a wide array of short-term courses and runs several research centers and summer school programs.

==Expatriate community ==

Tbilisi is home to many foreigners. The number of foreigners living and working in Tbilisi has risen in recent years together with the openings of international schools, businesses, expatriate communities, and online networks. Tbilisi is a very safe city. Most of the expatriates live in Vake, Vera, Saburtalo, and Dighomi.

<text>In logic, mathematics, and computer science, arity () is the number of arguments or operands taken by a function, operation or relation. In mathematics, arity may also be called rank, but this word can have many other meanings. In logic and philosophy, arity may also be called adicity and degree. In linguistics, it is usually named [[valency (linguistics)|valency]].

== Examples ==
In general, functions or operators with a given arity follow the naming conventions of &quot;n&quot;-based numeral systems, such as binary and hexadecimal. A Latin prefix is combined with the -ary suffix. For example:
* A nullary function takes no arguments.
** Example: formula_1
* A unary function takes one argument.
** Example: formula_2
* A binary function takes two arguments.
** Example: formula_3
* A ternary function takes three arguments.
** Example: formula_4
* An &quot;n&quot;-ary function takes &quot;n&quot; arguments.
** Example: formula_5

=== Nullary ===
A constant can be treated as the output of an operation of arity 0, called a &quot;nullary operation&quot;.

Also, outside of functional programming, a function without arguments can be meaningful and not necessarily constant (due to side effects). Such functions may have some &quot;hidden input&quot;, such as global variables or the whole state of the system (time, free memory, etc.).

=== Unary ===
Examples of unary operators in mathematics and in programming include the unary minus and plus, the increment and decrement operators in C-style languages (not in logical languages), and the successor, factorial, reciprocal, floor, ceiling, fractional part, sign, absolute value, square root (the principal square root), complex conjugate (unary of &quot;one&quot; complex number, that however has two parts at a lower level of abstraction), and norm functions in mathematics. In programming the two&#x27;s complement, address reference, and the logical NOT operators are examples of unary operators.

All functions in lambda calculus and in some functional programming languages (especially those descended from ML) are technically unary, but see n-ary below.

According to Quine, the Latin distributives being &quot;singuli&quot;, &quot;bini&quot;, &quot;terni&quot;, and so forth, the term &quot;singulary&quot; is the correct adjective, rather than &quot;unary&quot;. Abraham Robinson follows Quine&#x27;s usage.

In philosophy, the adjective &quot;monadic&quot; is sometimes used to describe a one-place relation such as &#x27;is square-shaped&#x27; as opposed to a two-place relation such as &#x27;is the sister of&#x27;.

=== Binary ===
Most operators encountered in programming and mathematics are of the binary form. For both programming and mathematics, these include the multiplication operator, the radix operator, the often omitted exponentiation operator, the logarithm operator, the addition operator, and the division operator. Logical predicates such as &quot;OR&quot;, &quot;XOR&quot;, &quot;AND&quot;, &quot;IMP&quot; are typically used as binary operators with two distinct operands. In CISC architectures, it is common to have two source operands (and store result in one of them).

=== Ternary ===
The computer programming language C and its various descendants (including C++, C#, Java, Julia, Perl, and others) provide the ternary conditional operator codice_1. The first operand (the condition) is evaluated, and if it is true, the result of the entire expression is the value of the second operand, otherwise it is the value of the third operand.

The Python language has a ternary conditional expression, . In Elixir the equivalent would be, .

The Forth language also contains a ternary operator, codice_2, which multiplies the first two (one-cell) numbers, dividing by the third, with the intermediate result being a double cell number. This is used when the intermediate result would overflow a single cell.

The Unix dc calculator has several ternary operators, such as codice_3, which will pop three values from the stack and efficiently compute formula_6 with arbitrary precision.

Many (RISC) assembly language instructions are ternary (as opposed to only two operands specified in CISC); or higher, such as MOV %AX, (%BX, %CX), which will load () into register the contents of a calculated memory location that is the sum (parenthesis) of the registers and .

=== &quot;n&quot;-ary ===
The arithmetic mean of &quot;n&quot; real numbers is an &quot;n&quot;-ary function: formula_7

Similarly, the geometric mean of &quot;n&quot; positive real numbers is an &quot;n&quot;-ary function: formula_8 Note that a logarithm of the geometric mean is the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of its &quot;n&quot; arguments

From a mathematical point of view, a function of &quot;n&quot; arguments can always be considered as a function of a single argument that is an element of some product space. However, it may be convenient for notation to consider &quot;n&quot;-ary functions, as for example multilinear maps (which are not linear maps on the product space, if ).

The same is true for programming languages, where functions taking several arguments could always be defined as functions taking a single argument of some composite type such as a tuple, or in languages with higher-order functions, by currying.

=== Varying arity ===
In computer science, a function that accepts a variable number of arguments is called &quot;variadic&quot;. In logic and philosophy, predicates or relations accepting a variable number of arguments are called &quot;multigrade&quot;, anadic, or variably polyadic.

== Terminology ==
Latinate names are commonly used for specific arities, primarily based on Latin distributive numbers meaning &quot;in group of &quot;n&quot;&quot;, though some are based on Latin cardinal numbers or ordinal numbers. For example, 1-ary is based on cardinal &quot;unus&quot;, rather than from distributive &quot;singulī&quot; that would result in &quot;singulary&quot;. 

&quot;n&quot;-&quot;ary&quot; means having &quot;n&quot; operands (or parameters), but is often used as a synonym of &quot;polyadic&quot;.

These words are often used to describe anything related to that number (e.g., undenary chess is a chess variant with an 11×11 board, or the Millenary Petition of 1603).

The arity of a relation (or predicate) is the dimension of the domain in the corresponding Cartesian product. (A function of arity &quot;n&quot; thus has arity &quot;n&quot;+1 considered as a relation.) 

In computer programming, there is often a syntactical distinction between operators and functions; syntactical operators usually have arity 1, 2, or 3 (the ternary operator ?: is also common). Functions vary widely in the number of arguments, though large numbers can become unwieldy. Some programming languages also offer support for variadic functions, i.e., functions syntactically accepting a variable number of arguments.

<text>Augusto Boal (16 March 1931 – 2 May 2009) was a Brazilian theatre practitioner, drama theorist, and political activist. He was the founder of Theatre of the Oppressed, a theatrical form originally used in radical left popular education movements. Boal served one term as a &quot;Vereador&quot; (the Brazilian equivalent of a city councillor) in Rio de Janeiro from 1993 to 1997, where he developed legislative theatre.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Augusto Boal studied at Columbia University in New York with the critic John Gassner. Gassner introduced Boal to the techniques of both Bertolt Brecht and Konstantin Stanislavski, and encouraged Boal to form links with theatre groups like the Black Experimental Theatre. In 1955 Boal staged productions of two of his own plays, &quot;The Horse and the Saint&quot; and &quot;The House Across the Street&quot;. In 1956, shortly after graduating, Boal was asked to work with the Arena Theatre in São Paulo, southeast Brazil. Boal was in charge of directing plays along with other dramaturgs such as José Renato, who was also the founder of the Arena Theatre. It was here that he began to experiment with new forms of theatre never before seen in Brazil, such as Stanislavski&#x27;s &#x27;system&#x27; for actors, with which he became familiar during his time at Columbia and when involved with the Actors Studio in New York. Boal adapted these methods to social conditions in Brazil, taking a leftist approach on issues concerning nationalism, which were very much in vogue at that time period since the country had just undergone a long period of military dictatorship.

===Work at the Arena Theatre of São Paulo===
While working at the Arena Theatre in São Paulo, Boal directed a number of classical dramas, which he transformed to make them more pertinent to Brazilian society and its economy. Among these plays was John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, known in Brazil as &quot;Ratos e Homens.&quot; This was Boal&#x27;s first performance as a director at the Arena Theatre of São Paulo. Critics acclaimed this piece and Boal won the &quot;Prêmio de Revelação de Direção&quot; (Direction Revelation Award) from the Association of Art Critics of São Paulo, in 1956. In the early sixties, the ratings at the Arena Theatre of São Paulo started to drop, almost causing the theatre to go bankrupt. Consequently, the company decided to start investing in national theatre (pieces written by Brazilian dramaturgs) as a move that could possibly save it from bankruptcy. The new investment proved to be a success, opening up the path for a national theatre scene. Boal then suggested the creation of a Seminar in Dramaturgy at the Arena Theatre, which was quickly implemented and soon became a national platform for many young playwrights. Many successful productions were born from this Seminar and now form part of the Arena Theatre of São Paulo&#x27;s nationalist phase repertoire. One of these productions was &quot;Chapetuba Futebol Clube&quot;, written by Oduvaldo Vianna Filho in 1959 and directed by Augusto Boal.

===Exile===
A new military regime started in Brazil in 1964 with a coup d&#x27;état supported by the Brazilian elite, the industrialists, the military, as well as by the United States, Boal&#x27;s teachings were controversial, and as a cultural activist he was seen as a threat by the Brazilian military regime. In 1971, Boal was kidnapped off the street, arrested, tortured, and eventually exiled to Argentina, where he stayed for five years. During those five years, Boal published two books: &quot;Torquemada&quot; (1971) and his much acclaimed &quot;Theatre of the Oppressed&quot; (1973). &quot;Torquemada&quot; is about the Brazilian military regime&#x27;s systematic use of torture in prison. Boal takes the name of the leading figure of the Spanish Inquisition, Tomas de Torquemada, as an example of historical forms of systematic torture. In &quot;Theatre of the Oppressed&quot; Boal develops a theatrical method based on &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot;, a book by the Brazilian educator and writer Paulo Freire (who was also a good friend of Boal).

Boal&#x27;s method (which has been implemented in various communities around the world) seeks to transform audiences into active participants in the theatrical experience. Boal argues that traditional theatre is oppressive since spectators usually do not get a chance to express themselves and that a collaboration between both parties, in contrast, allows spectators to perform actions that are socially liberating. The method, as Boal liked to explain, seeks to transform spectators into &quot;spect-actors.&quot; When the political climate in Brazil forced Boal into exile in 1971, he initially went to Peru and then Argentina, where he completed and published his seminal theoretical work &quot;The Theatre of the Oppressed&quot; and consolidated his conscientização (consciousness-raising) theatre work based on the idea of Brazilian educationalist Paulo Freire. Freire&#x27;s methods were a revolt against the elitist &quot;top-down&quot; approach to education and he advocated critical-awareness-based education models. Boal&#x27;s work in Peru with the ALFIN project, a movement which sought to use a range of languages including &quot;artistic languages&quot; to eradicate illiteracy, developed his ideas and methodology away from the agit-prop of his Brazilian Arena Theatre days and sought to engage theatre as a pedagogical tool. Crucial to this time was Boal&#x27;s attempts to break down the divisions between spectator and actor. It is around this time that invented the term &quot;spect-actor&quot;, a term that he saw as establishing the frameworks within which he wished to work. He saw that the passivity of the spectator could be broken down by the following steps by which the spectator becomes the spect-actor:

* Knowing the body (by body he means both the individual &quot;body&quot; and the collective &quot;body&quot; in a Marxist sense)
* Making the body expressive
* Using theatre as a language
* Using theatre as discourse

After living in Argentina, Boal travelled to other countries in South America such as Peru and Ecuador, where he worked with people in small and usually poor communities that dealt with conflicts such as civil wars and lack of government attention. Boal was of the opinion that only the oppressed are able to free the oppressed. In Peru, Boal practiced his Forum theatre method, in which spectator replaces actor to determine the solution to a given problem presented by the actor, which can also be a real problem someone in the community is facing. Boal also lived in Paris, France, for a number of years, where he created several Centers for the Theatre of the Oppressed, directed plays, and also taught classes at the Sorbonne University. Boal created the first International Festival for the Theatre of the Oppressed in 1981.

While Boal was in exile, his very close friend and Brazilian musician Chico Buarque wrote him a letter that would later result in the Chorinho hit called &quot;Meu Caro Amigo&quot; or &quot;My Dear Friend&quot; (1976). In this song, Buarque tells his friend about the situation in Brazil at the time, addressing the military dictatorship in a very subtle but clever way (due to censorship issues, many artists could not express themselves freely). The melody of the song is very happy and upbeat while the lyrics explain:

My dear friend, please forgive me, if I can’t pay you a visit, but since I found someone to carry a message, I’m sending you news on this tape. Here we play football, there’s lots of samba, lots of choro and rock’n&#x27;roll. Some days it rains, some days it’s sunny but I want to tell you that things here are pretty dark. Here, we’re wheeling and dealing for survival, and we’re only surviving because we’re stubborn. And everyone’s drinking because without cachaça, nobody survives this squeeze.

===Center for the Theatre of the Oppressed-CTO-Brazil===
After the fall of the military dictatorship, Boal returned to Brazil after 14 years of exile in 1986. He established a major Center for the Theatre of the Oppressed in Rio de Janeiro (CTO), whose objective was to study, discuss and express issues concerning citizenship, culture and various forms of oppression using theatrical language. Boal&#x27;s work in the CTO made way for the approval of a new law that protects crime victims and witnesses in Brazil. Boal&#x27;s group has worked next to numerous organizations that fight for human rights. In 1992, Boal ran for city councillor in Rio de Janeiro as a theatrical act, and he was elected. Boal&#x27;s support staff was his theatre group, with whom he quickly developed various legislative proposals. His objective was to work out issues citizens might be facing in their communities through theatre and also to discuss the laws of the city of Rio with people on the streets. After having worked to transform spectator into author in Theatre of the Oppressed, Boal initiates the legislative theatre movement process, in which voter becomes legislator. Boal is known to say that he did not create laws arbitrarily while he was city councillor. Instead, he asked people what they wanted. Other politicians were not very fond of this. Out of 40 of Boal&#x27;s proposed laws, only 13 got approved during his term as councillor of Rio de Janeiro. His term ended in 1996, but he continued performing legislative theatre acts with different groups in Brasília, where four more laws got approved even after Boal had left. Boal also worked with prisoners in Rio and São Paulo. Boal argued that people in prison are not free in space, but that they are in time, and that the Theatre of the Oppressed strives to create different types of freedom so that people are able to imagine and think about the past, the present, and invent the future instead of having to wait for it. All this was in order for prisoners to have &quot;a healthier and more creative lifestyle.&quot; People in the Movimento sem Terra or Landless Workers Movement of Brazil also experienced working with Boal&#x27;s theatre methods. Boal&#x27;s son Julián worked along with his father and now continues to take the Theatre of the Oppressed to various communities in Brazil and around the world. In March 2009, he received the title of &quot;World Theatre Ambassador&quot; from UNESCO.

===Death===
Augusto Boal died on 2 May 2009 at the age of 78 in Rio de Janeiro. Critic Yan Michalski argues that Augusto Boal is the best-known and most respected Brazilian theatre practitioner abroad.

==Influences==

Most of Augusto Boal&#x27;s techniques were created after he realized the limitations of didactic, politically motivated theatre in the poor areas where he worked. He found that his attempts to inspire the people living in poor or &quot;slum&quot; areas to rise up against racial and class inequality were inhibited by his own racial and class background, since he was white and comparatively financially comfortable, as well as his and his colleagues&#x27; inhibitions to perform violence themselves. His new techniques allowed the idea of rebellion and the impetus for change to come from within the target group. Much of his early work and teaching was inspired by Marxist philosophy, although much of his work now falls within the boundaries of a center-left ideology.

Paulo Freire was a major influence on Boal&#x27;s teachings. He and Freire became close in later years. When Freire died, Boal said: &quot;I am very sad. I have lost my last father. Now all I have are brothers and sisters&quot;.

Boal was also known to quote William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in which Hamlet argues that theatre is like a mirror that reflects our virtues and defects equally. Although Boal found this quote beautiful, he liked to think of theatre as a mirror in which one can reach in to change reality and to transform it.

==Published works==

===&quot;Theatre of the Oppressed&quot; (London: Pluto Press, 1979)===
Arguably Augusto Boal&#x27;s most academically influential work is the &quot;Theatre of the Oppressed,&quot; in which the reader follows Boal&#x27;s detailed analysis of the &quot;Poetics&quot; of Aristotle and the early history of Western theatre. Boal contends that the Aristotelian ethic means oppressing the masses, the people, the workers and the spectators in favour of stability and the continued dominance of a privileged few. He argues that the &quot;Tragi-drama&quot;, a formulaic drama style that today could be considered similar to that of soap operas, helps the State promote its continued existence. He sees the Brazilian government as an example of an oppressive state using theatre to propagate its oppressive system. He then outlines his early theories and practices for attempting to reverse the paradigm. It also talks about Newspaper Theatre, attempting to talk about local problems and present it to the audiences, Forum Theatre, currently used in over 70 countries, Invisible Theatre, used to discuss political activity and Image Theatre. Theatre of the Oppressed has been translated to more than 25 languages over the years. 
Boal also talks about Invisible theatre in which an event is planned and scripted but does not allow the spectators to know that the event is happening. Actors perform out of the ordinary roles which invite spectators to join in or sit back and watch. One example was in a restaurant at the Chiclayo hotel, actors sat at separate tables and informed the waiters in loud voices that they could not eat the food. The actor stated that the food was not good. The waiter says the diner could pick something else to eat. So the actor chose a rather expensive item off the menu and says he will be able to pay for it. The actor mentions he has no money and he would be willing to work for it. This display made other diners start discussing the price and treatment of workers at this hotel. This act allowed spectators to think about issues that were going on but was brushed over because the issue did not directly involve them.
Analytical theatre is when a participant tells a story and the actors improvise it. Each character is broken down into all the social roles they could follow and the participants choose an object to symbolize the role. This aspect of theatre allows the participants to see how there are multiple roles a person could follow.

===&quot;Games For Actors and Non-Actors&quot; (London: Routledge, 1992; Second Edition 2002)===

This is probably Augusto Boal&#x27;s most practically influential book, in which he sets down a brief explanation of his theories, mostly through stories and examples of his work in Europe, and then explains every drama exercise that he has found useful in his practice. In contrast to &quot;Theatre of the Oppressed&quot;, it contains little academic theory and many practical examples for drama practitioners to use even if not practising theatre that is related to Boal&#x27;s academic or political ideas. Boal refers to many of these as &quot;gamesercises&quot;, as they combine the training and &quot;introversion&quot; of exercises with the fun and &quot;extroversion&quot; of games. It has been influential in the development of Community Theatre and Theatre in Education (T.I.E.) practices worldwide, especially in Europe and South America. These games include &quot;Carnival in Rio&quot; and &quot;Your Friend is Dead&quot;.

===&quot;The Rainbow of Desire: The Boal Method of Theatre and Therapy&quot;. (London: Routledge, 1995)===
This book re-evaluates the practices commonly associated with the Theatre of the Oppressed for a new purpose. It has been argued that Boal contradicts himself with this take on his work, as it mostly concerns itself with creating harmony within society, whereas his early work was concerned with rebellion and upheaval. Boal states that, &quot;Theatre is the passionate combat of two human beings on a platform.&quot; However, Boal&#x27;s works can be seen as a progression and exploration of a Left Wing world view rather than a unified theory. In the context of those under-represented in a society, his methodology can be used as a weapon against oppressors. In the context of those in a society who are in need of catharsis for the sake of their own integration into it, it can be switched round to empower that individual to break down internal oppressions that separate that individual from society.
Through his work at French institutions for the mentally ill and elsewhere in Europe, where he discovered concepts such as the &quot;Cop in the Head&quot;, the theories presented in this book have been useful in the pioneering field of drama therapy and have been applied by drama practitioners.
Boal states in his work that there are three properties of the aesthetic space. First, is plasticity. He says that one can be without being. Objects can acquire different meaning such as an old chair representing a king&#x27;s throne. He states that only duration counts and location can be changed. Second, is that the aesthetic space is dichotomic and it creates dichotomy. This idea suggests that there is a space within a space. The stage is in front of the audience and the actor is creating his own space. Third, is telemicroscopic. This idea creates the idea that it is impossible to hide on stage. Every aspect of the space is seen and it makes the far away close-up.

==Recognition==

In 1994, Boal won the UNESCO Pablo Picasso Medal, and in August 1997, he was awarded the &quot;Career Achievement Award&quot; by the Association of Theatre in Higher Education at their national conference in Chicago, Illinois. Boal is also seen as the inspiration behind 21st-century forms of performance-activism, such as the &quot;Optative Theatrical Laboratories&quot;.

Boal received The Cross Border Award for Peace and Democracy by Dundalk Institute of Technology in 2008. Boal has in many ways influenced many artists in new media with his participatory modes of expression, especially as the World Wide Web has become such a powerful tool for participation and communication. Notable examples include &quot;Learning to Love You More&quot;, happenings, and Steve Lambert&#x27;s Why They Hate US.

<text>In topology, the closure of a subset of points in a topological space consists of all points in together with all limit points of . The closure of may equivalently be defined as the union of and its boundary, and also as the intersection of all closed sets containing . Intuitively, the closure can be thought of as all the points that are either in or &quot;very near&quot; . A point which is in the closure of is a point of closure of . The notion of closure is in many ways dual to the notion of interior.

==Definitions==

=== Point of closure ===
For formula_1 as a subset of a Euclidean space, formula_2 is a point of closure of formula_1 if every open ball centered at formula_2 contains a point of formula_1 (this point can be formula_2 itself).

This definition generalizes to any subset formula_1 of a metric space formula_8 Fully expressed, for formula_9 as a metric space with metric formula_10 formula_2 is a point of closure of formula_1 if for every formula_13 there exists some formula_14 such that the distance formula_15 (formula_16 is allowed). Another way to express this is to say that formula_2 is a point of closure of formula_1 if the distance formula_19 where formula_20 is the infimum. 

This definition generalizes to topological spaces by replacing &quot;open ball&quot; or &quot;ball&quot; with &quot;neighbourhood&quot;. Let formula_1 be a subset of a topological space formula_8 Then formula_2 is a or of formula_1 if every neighbourhood of formula_2 contains a point of formula_1 (again, formula_16 for formula_14 is allowed). Note that this definition does not depend upon whether neighbourhoods are required to be open.

=== Limit point ===
The definition of a point of closure of a set is closely related to the definition of a limit point of a set. The difference between the two definitions is subtle but important – namely, in the definition of a limit point formula_2 of a set formula_1, every neighbourhood of formula_2 must contain a point of formula_1 , i.e., each neighbourhood of formula_2 obviously has formula_2 but it also must have a point of formula_1 that is not equal to formula_2 in order for formula_2 to be a limit point of formula_1. A limit point of formula_1 has more strict condition than a point of closure of formula_1 in the definitions. The set of all limit points of a set formula_1 is called the . A limit point of a set is also called &quot;cluster point&quot; or &quot;accumulation point&quot; of the set. 

Thus, &quot;every limit point is a point of closure, but not every point of closure is a limit point&quot;. A point of closure which is not a limit point is an isolated point. In other words, a point formula_2 is an isolated point of formula_1 if it is an element of formula_1 and there is a neighbourhood of formula_2 which contains no other points of formula_1 than formula_2 itself.

For a given set formula_1 and point formula_49 formula_2 is a point of closure of formula_1 if and only if formula_2 is an element of formula_1 or formula_2 is a limit point of formula_1 (or both).

===Closure of a set===
The of a subset formula_1 of a topological space formula_57 denoted by formula_58 or possibly by formula_59 (if formula_60 is understood), where if both formula_9 and formula_60 are clear from context then it may also be denoted by formula_63 formula_64 or formula_65 (Moreover, formula_66 is sometimes capitalized to formula_67.) can be defined using any of the following equivalent definitions:
# formula_68 is the set of all points of closure of formula_69
# formula_68 is the set formula_1 together with all of its limit points. (Each point of formula_1 is a point of closure of formula_1, and each limit point of formula_1 is also a point of closure of formula_1.)
# formula_68 is the intersection of all closed sets containing formula_69
# formula_68 is the smallest closed set containing formula_69
# formula_68 is the union of formula_1 and its boundary formula_82
# formula_68 is the set of all formula_84 for which there exists a net (valued) in formula_1 that converges to formula_2 in formula_87

The closure of a set has the following properties.

* formula_68 is a closed superset of formula_1.
* The set formula_1 is closed if and only if formula_91.
* If formula_92 then formula_68 is a subset of formula_94
* If formula_95 is a closed set, then formula_95 contains formula_1 if and only if formula_95 contains formula_99

Sometimes the second or third property above is taken as the of the topological closure, which still make sense when applied to other types of closures (see below).

In a first-countable space (such as a metric space), formula_68 is the set of all limits of all convergent sequences of points in formula_69 For a general topological space, this statement remains true if one replaces &quot;sequence&quot; by &quot;net&quot; or &quot;filter&quot; (as described in the article on filters in topology).

Note that these properties are also satisfied if &quot;closure&quot;, &quot;superset&quot;, &quot;intersection&quot;, &quot;contains/containing&quot;, &quot;smallest&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; are replaced by &quot;interior&quot;, &quot;subset&quot;, &quot;union&quot;, &quot;contained in&quot;, &quot;largest&quot;, and &quot;open&quot;. For more on this matter, see closure operator below.

==Examples==
Consider a sphere in a 3 dimensional space. Implicitly there are two regions of interest created by this sphere; the sphere itself and its interior (which is called an open 3-ball). It is useful to distinguish between the interior and the surface of the sphere, so we distinguish between the open 3-ball (the interior of the sphere), and the closed 3-ball – the closure of the open 3-ball that is the open 3-ball plus the surface (the surface as the sphere itself).

In topological space:
* In any space, formula_102. In other words, the closure of the empty set formula_103 is formula_103 itself. 
* In any space formula_105 formula_106

Giving formula_107 and formula_108 the standard (metric) topology:
* If formula_9 is the Euclidean space formula_107 of real numbers, then formula_111. In other words., the closure of the set formula_112 as a subset of formula_9 is formula_114.
* If formula_9 is the Euclidean space formula_107, then the closure of the set formula_117 of rational numbers is the whole space formula_118 We say that formula_117 is dense in formula_118
* If formula_9 is the complex plane formula_122 then formula_123
* If formula_1 is a finite subset of a Euclidean space formula_105 then formula_126 (For a general topological space, this property is equivalent to the T1 axiom.)

On the set of real numbers one can put other topologies rather than the standard one.
* If formula_127 is endowed with the lower limit topology, then formula_128
* If one considers on formula_127 the discrete topology in which every set is closed (open), then formula_130
* If one considers on formula_127 the trivial topology in which the only closed (open) sets are the empty set and formula_107 itself, then formula_133

These examples show that the closure of a set depends upon the topology of the underlying space. The last two examples are special cases of the following.

* In any discrete space, since every set is closed (and also open), every set is equal to its closure.
* In any indiscrete space formula_105 since the only closed sets are the empty set and formula_9 itself, we have that the closure of the empty set is the empty set, and for every non-empty subset formula_95 of formula_105 formula_138 In other words, every non-empty subset of an indiscrete space is dense.

The closure of a set also depends upon in which space we are taking the closure. For example, if formula_9 is the set of rational numbers, with the usual relative topology induced by the Euclidean space formula_140 and if formula_141 then formula_1 is both closed and open in formula_117 because neither formula_1 nor its complement can contain formula_145, which would be the lower bound of formula_1, but cannot be in formula_1 because formula_145 is irrational. So, formula_1 has no well defined closure due to boundary elements not being in formula_117. However, if we instead define formula_9 to be the set of real numbers and define the interval in the same way then the closure of that interval is well defined and would be the set of all greater than formula_145.

==Closure operator==

A on a set formula_9 is a mapping of the power set of formula_105 formula_155, into itself which satisfies the Kuratowski closure axioms. 
Given a topological space formula_156, the topological closure induces a function formula_157 that is defined by sending a subset formula_158 to formula_159 where the notation formula_160 or formula_161 may be used instead. Conversely, if formula_162 is a closure operator on a set formula_105 then a topological space is obtained by defining the closed sets as being exactly those subsets formula_158 that satisfy formula_165 (so complements in formula_9 of these subsets form the open sets of the topology).

The closure operator formula_167 is dual to the interior operator, which is denoted by formula_168 in the sense that

:formula_169

and also

:formula_170

Therefore, the abstract theory of closure operators and the Kuratowski closure axioms can be readily translated into the language of interior operators by replacing sets with their complements in formula_8

In general, the closure operator does not commute with intersections. However, in a complete metric space the following result does hold:

==Facts about closures==

A subset formula_1 is closed in formula_9 if and only if formula_126 In particular:
* The closure of the empty set is the empty set;
* The closure of formula_9 itself is formula_8
* The closure of an intersection of sets is always a subset of (but need not be equal to) the intersection of the closures of the sets. 
* In a union of finitely many sets, the closure of the union and the union of the closures are equal; the union of zero sets is the empty set, and so this statement contains the earlier statement about the closure of the empty set as a special case. 
* The closure of the union of infinitely many sets need not equal the union of the closures, but it is always a superset of the union of the closures.
** Thus, just as the union of two closed sets is closed, so too does closure distribute over binary unions: that is, formula_177 But just as a union of infinitely many closed sets is not necessarily closed, so too does closure not necessarily distribute over infinite unions: that is, formula_178 is possible when formula_179 is infinite.

If formula_180 and if formula_181 is a subspace of formula_9 (meaning that formula_181 is endowed with the subspace topology that formula_9 induces on it), then formula_185 and the closure of formula_1 computed in formula_181 is equal to the intersection of formula_181 and the closure of formula_1 computed in formula_9: 
formula_191

Because formula_59 is a closed subset of formula_105 the intersection formula_194 is a closed subset of formula_181 (by definition of the subspace topology), which implies that formula_196 (because formula_197 is the closed subset of formula_181 containing formula_1). Because formula_197 is a closed subset of formula_201 from the definition of the subspace topology, there must exist some set formula_202 such that formula_203 is closed in formula_9 and formula_205 Because formula_206 and formula_203 is closed in formula_105 the minimality of formula_59 implies that formula_210 Intersecting both sides with formula_181 shows that formula_212 formula_213
It follows that formula_92 is a dense subset of formula_181 if and only if formula_181 is a subset of formula_217 
It is possible for formula_218 to be a proper subset of formula_219 for example, take formula_220 formula_221 and formula_222

If formula_223 but formula_1 is not necessarily a subset of formula_181 then only 
formula_226
is always guaranteed, where this containment could be strict (consider for instance formula_227 with the usual topology, formula_228 and formula_229), although if formula_181 happens to an open subset of formula_9 then the equality formula_232 will hold (no matter the relationship between formula_1 and formula_181). 
Let formula_223 and assume that formula_181 is open in formula_8 Let formula_238 which is equal to formula_239 (because formula_240). The complement formula_241 is open in formula_201 where formula_181 being open in formula_9 now implies that formula_241 is also open in formula_8 Consequently formula_247 is a closed subset of formula_9 where formula_249 contains formula_1 as a subset (because if formula_14 is in formula_181 then formula_253), which implies that formula_254 Intersecting both sides with formula_181 proves that formula_256 The reverse inclusion follows from formula_257 formula_213
Consequently, if formula_259 is any open cover of formula_9 and if formula_158 is any subset then:
formula_262 
because formula_263 for every formula_264 (where every formula_264 is endowed with the subspace topology induced on it by formula_9). 
This equality is particularly useful when formula_9 is a manifold and the sets in the open cover formula_259 are domains of coordinate charts. 
In words, this result shows that the closure in formula_9 of any subset formula_158 can be computed &quot;locally&quot; in the sets of any open cover of formula_9 and then unioned together.
In this way, this result can be viewed as the analogue of the well-known fact that a subset formula_158 is closed in formula_9 if and only if it is &quot;locally closed in formula_9&quot;, meaning that if formula_259 is any open cover of formula_9 then formula_1 is closed in formula_9 if and only if formula_279 is closed in formula_280 for every formula_281

==Functions and closure==

===Continuity===

A function formula_282 between topological spaces is continuous if and only if the preimage of every closed subset of the codomain is closed in the domain; explicitly, this means: formula_283 is closed in formula_9 whenever formula_203 is a closed subset of formula_286 

In terms of the closure operator, formula_282 is continuous if and only if for every subset formula_288 
formula_289
That is to say, given any element formula_84 that belongs to the closure of a subset formula_288 formula_292 necessarily belongs to the closure of formula_293 in formula_286 If we declare that a point formula_2 is a subset formula_296 if formula_297 then this terminology allows for a plain English description of continuity: formula_298 is continuous if and only if for every subset formula_288 formula_298 maps points that are close to formula_95 to points that are close to formula_302 Thus continuous functions are exactly those functions that preserve (in the forward direction) the &quot;closeness&quot; relationship between points and sets: a function is continuous if and only if whenever a point is close to a set then the image of that point is close to the image of that set. 
Similarly, formula_298 is continuous at a fixed given point formula_84 if and only if whenever formula_2 is close to a subset formula_288 then formula_292 is close to formula_302

===Closed maps===

A function formula_282 is a (strongly) closed map if and only if whenever formula_203 is a closed subset of formula_9 then formula_312 is a closed subset of formula_286 
In terms of the closure operator, formula_282 is a (strongly) closed map if and only if formula_315 for every subset formula_316 
Equivalently, formula_282 is a (strongly) closed map if and only if formula_318 for every closed subset formula_319

==Categorical interpretation==
One may define the closure operator in terms of universal arrows, as follows.

The powerset of a set formula_9 may be realized as a partial order category formula_321 in which the objects are subsets and the morphisms are inclusion maps formula_322 whenever formula_95 is a subset of formula_324 Furthermore, a topology formula_181 on formula_9 is a subcategory of formula_321 with inclusion functor formula_328 The set of closed subsets containing a fixed subset formula_296 can be identified with the comma category formula_330 This category — also a partial order — then has initial object formula_331 Thus there is a universal arrow from formula_95 to formula_333 given by the inclusion formula_334

Similarly, since every closed set containing formula_335 corresponds with an open set contained in formula_95 we can interpret the category formula_337 as the set of open subsets contained in formula_338 with terminal object formula_339 the interior of formula_340

All properties of the closure can be derived from this definition and a few properties of the above categories. Moreover, this definition makes precise the analogy between the topological closure and other types of closures (for example algebraic closure), since all are examples of universal arrows.

<text>Marien Ngouabi (December 31, 1938 – March 18, 1977) was a Congolese politician and military officer who served as the fourth President of the Republic of the Congo from 1969 until his assassination in 1977.

==Biography==

===Origins===
Marien Ngouabi was born in 1938 at the village of Ombellé, Cuvette Department, in Kouyou territory to Dominique Osséré m&#x27;Opoma and Antoinette Mboualé-Abemba. He is originally from a kuyu humble family. From 1947 to 1953, he went to primary school in Owando. On 14 September 1953, he went to study at the &quot;Ecole des enfants de troupes Général Leclerc&quot; in Brazzaville and in 1957, he was sent to Bouar, Oubangui-Chari (now the Central African Republic).

After serving in Cameroon as a member of the second battalion of the tirailleurs with the rank of Sergeant (1958–1960), Ngouabi went to the &quot;Ecole Militaire Préparatoire&quot; in Strasbourg, France in September 1960 and then to the &quot;Ecole Inter-armes&quot; at Coëtquidan Saint-Cyr in 1961. He returned to Congo in 1962 as Second Lieutenant and was stationed at the Pointe-Noire garrison. He was assigned to the Pointe-Noire garrison as a deputy commander of an infantry battalion. In 1963, Ngouabi was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant.

===Rise to power===
In 1965, he created the first battalion of paratroopers in the Congo Republic. Known for his leftist views, in April 1966 Ngouabi was demoted to the rank of soldier second class when he refused to be posted again at Pointe-Noire, after rebelling against the army&#x27;s inflexibility in politics and voicing strong criticism to the president. President Alphonse Massamba-Débat had Ngouabi and Second Lieutenant Eyabo arrested on July 29, 1968.

Ngouabi&#x27;s arrest provoked discontent among the military, and on July 31, Ngouabi was freed by soldiers from the Civil Defense. The National Revolutionary Council (CNR), headed by Ngouabi, was created on August 5, 1968. On 1 October 1968, he was promoted to the rank of Commanding Officer, a rank he held until his death. Massamba-Débat, whose powers had been curtailed by the CNR, resigned on September 4, and Prime Minister Alfred Raoul served as acting head of state until December 31, 1968, when the CNR formally became the country&#x27;s supreme authority and Ngouabi, as head of the CNR, assumed the presidency.

===Head of state===
Once in power, President Ngouabi changed the country&#x27;s name to the People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo, declaring it to be Africa&#x27;s first Marxist–Leninist state, and founded the Congolese Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Parti Congolais du Travail&quot;, PCT) as the country&#x27;s only legal political party.

Ngouabi was a Mbochi from the north and his regime shifted control of the country away from the south. Such moves created opposition among the population in the highly politicized environment of Brazzaville. Bureaucratic centralism, repression, the &quot;mechanism&quot; of the party apparatus, and Ngouabi&#x27;s tribalist orientation towards Mbochi and La Cuvette immigrants created opposition within the Communist Party itself, especially its youth organization. In the fall of 1971, students that went on strike in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire were severely repressed by the authorities. The situation in the country was severely destabilized. There was an attempted coup in February 1972 that triggered a series of &#x27;purges&#x27; of the opposition. It is claimed that Ngouabi was under French pressure to annex the oil-rich Cabinda enclave, a part of Portuguese Angola, and his refusal to act cost him the French support. There is some speculation that the French financed several coups in order to remove Ngouabi in power. Starting in February 1973, the army began military operations in the Goma Tse-tse region to dismantle the M22 insurgency led by former army members led by Vice President Ange Diawara. During the same month, Ngouabi denounced another attempted Diawara coup and arrested 45 people, including Pascal Lissouba and Sylvain Bemba, Minister of Information. His trial took place from March 16 to 23. Several sentences were pronounced, while Lissouba was acquitted.

The M22 business abruptly ended on April 24, 1973, with the capture and execution of the maquis. The bodies of Diawara, Ikoko and Bakekolo were toured around Brazzaville and exhibited by Ngouabi in person during a popular gathering held at the Stade de la Révolution. The lack of consideration for the lifeless bodies of the Maquis caused considerable disapproval nationally due to the cultural sensitivity surrounding the reverential treatment of dead bodies. He visited the People&#x27;s Republic of China in July 1973.

Ngouabi was re-elected to his post as Chairman of the PCT Central Committee on December 30, 1974; he was additionally elected as Permanent Secretary of the PCT. He was then sworn in as president for another term on January 9, 1975. Also in 1975, he signed an economic aid pact with the Soviet Union.

On March 23, Lieutenant General Pierre Kinganga, in exile in Kinshasa in neighbouring Zaire since his alleged June 1969 coup attempt, disembarked in Brazzaville at the head of a commando attempting to overthrow the regime. His attempt failed and he was shot dead near the national radio station he had just taken. His body and that of his command members who fell with him remained exposed for a long time in front of the radio building. Several enthusiastic young supporters who had joined Kinganga&#x27;s column were also armed. Captain Augustin Poignet, also involved, managed to escape to Kinshasa. A week later, 3 accomplices (Miawouama, Nkoutou and Mengo), sentenced by a court-martial, were executed. The command members and accomplices in the army and gendarmerie were convicted by the revolutionary court. After the events, Marien Ngouabi denounced the involvement of the CIA and President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) in the coup.

Following this attempt, the PCT met in an extraordinary congress from March 30 to April 2, 1970. The Political Bureau was expanded to 10 members, to the benefit of Ambroise Noumazalaye and Captain Sassou N&#x27;Guesso. The Gendarmerie, whose loyalty was not complete during the events, was dissolved and its members joined the army. The Council of State was reorganized.

On August 29, 1970, former Minister Stéphane-Maurice Bongo-Nouarra was arrested for a counter-revolutionary conspiracy. He was sentenced to 10 years of forced labour.

===Assassination===
On March 18, 1977, at 14:30 hours, President Ngouabi was assassinated. Those accused of taking part in the assassination were tried and some were executed including Massamba-Débat.

In the aftermath of the assassination, the Military Committee of the Party (CMP) was named to head an interim government with the conservative Colonel Joachim Yhombi-Opango to serve as Head of State.

==Commemoration==
March 18 is Marien Ngouabi Day in the Republic of Congo. The country&#x27;s only university is the Marien Ngouabi University in Brazzaville. Ngouabi is interred at the Marien Ngouabi Mausoleum in Brazzaville.

<doc id="42313" wikidata="Q1140649" url="?curid=42313" title="The Wicker Man">
<text>The Wicker Man is a 1973 British folk horror film directed by Robin Hardy and starring Edward Woodward, Britt Ekland, Diane Cilento, Ingrid Pitt and Christopher Lee. The screenplay is by Anthony Shaffer, inspired by David Pinner&#x27;s 1967 novel &quot;Ritual&quot;, and Paul Giovanni composed the film score.

The plot centres on the visit of a police officer, Sergeant Neil Howie, to the isolated Scottish island of Summerisle in search of a missing girl. Howie, a devout Christian, is appalled to find that the inhabitants of the island have abandoned Christianity and now practise a form of Celtic paganism.

&quot;The Wicker Man&quot; is well regarded by critics. Film magazine &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; described it as &quot;The &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of horror movies&quot;, and in 2004, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine named &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; the sixth-greatest British film of all time. It also won the 1978 Saturn Award for Best Horror Film. The final scene was number 45 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;, and during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, it was included as part of a sequence that celebrated British cinema. The film brought the wicker man into modern popular culture.

In 1989, Shaffer wrote a script treatment for &quot;The Loathsome Lambton Worm&quot;, a direct sequel with fantasy elements. Hardy had no interest in the project, and it went unproduced. In 2006, a poorly received American remake starring Nicolas Cage was released, from which Hardy and others involved with the original have dissociated themselves. In 2011, a spiritual sequel written and directed by Hardy, &quot;The Wicker Tree&quot;, was released; it featured Lee in a cameo appearance. In 2013, the original U.S. theatrical version of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; was digitally restored and released.

==Plot==
On 29 April, Sergeant Neil Howie journeys by seaplane to the remote, verdant Hebridean island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison, about whom he has received an anonymous letter. Howie, a devout Christian, is disturbed to find the islanders paying homage to the pagan Celtic gods of their ancestors, with churches having fallen into disuse. They copulate openly in the fields, include children as part of the May Day celebrations, teach children of the phallic association of the maypole, and place toads in their mouths to cure sore throats. The islanders appear to be trying to thwart his investigation by claiming that Rowan never existed.

While Howie is staying at the Green Man Inn, the landlord&#x27;s daughter attempts to seduce him, but he resists, explaining that he is engaged and saving himself for marriage. He notices a series of photographs celebrating the annual harvest, each featuring a young girl as the May Queen. The photograph of the most recent celebration is missing; the landlord tells him it was broken. At the local school, Howie asks the students about Rowan, but all deny her existence. He checks the school register and finds Rowan&#x27;s name. He questions the schoolteacher, who directs him to Rowan&#x27;s grave.

The next day, 30 April, Howie meets the island&#x27;s leader, Lord Summerisle, grandson of a Victorian agronomist, to get permission for an exhumation. Summerisle explains that his grandfather developed strains of fruit trees that would prosper in Scotland&#x27;s climate and encouraged the belief that returning to the old gods would bring prosperity to the island among the previously Christian population. Due to the bountiful harvests, the island&#x27;s other inhabitants gradually embraced paganism, and the Christian ministers fled to the mainland.

Exhuming the grave, Howie finds that the coffin contains only the carcass of a hare. He also finds the missing harvest photograph, showing Rowan standing amidst empty boxes; the harvest had failed. His research reveals that a human sacrifice is offered to the gods in the event of crop failure. He concludes that Rowan is alive and will soon be sacrificed to ensure a successful harvest.

The following morning, on May Day, Howie seeks assistance from the mainland and returns to his seaplane, only to discover it no longer functions and its radio is damaged; he cannot leave or call for help. Later that day, during the May Day celebration, Howie subdues the innkeeper and steals his costume and mask (that of Punch, the fool) to infiltrate the parade. Rowan is eventually revealed. Howie sets her free and flees with her into a cave. Exiting it, they are intercepted by the islanders, to whom Rowan happily returns.

Summerisle tells Howie that Rowan was never the intended sacrifice; Howie is. He fits their gods&#x27; four requirements: he came of his own free will, has &quot;the power of a king&quot; by representing the law, is a virgin, and is a &quot;fool&quot; by falling for their deception. Howie warns Summerisle and the islanders that the crops are failing due to the unsuitability of the climate, and that the villagers will turn on Summerisle and sacrifice him next summer when the harvest fails again, but his pleas are ignored.

The villagers force Howie inside a giant wicker man statue along with various animals, set it ablaze, and surround it, singing the Middle English folk song &quot;Sumer Is Icumen In&quot;. Inside the wicker man, Howie recites Psalm 23 and prays to God. Howie and the animals burn to death as the head of the wicker man collapses in flames, revealing the setting sun.

==Production==
===Background===

In the early 1970s, Christopher Lee was a Hammer Horror regular, best known for his roles in a series of successful films, beginning with &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; (as the monster, 1957). Lee wanted to break free of this image and take on more interesting acting roles. The idea for &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; film began in 1971 when Lee met with screenwriter Anthony Shaffer, and they agreed to work together. Film director Robin Hardy and British Lion head Peter Snell became involved in the project. Shaffer had a series of conversations with Hardy, and the two decided that making a horror film centring on &quot;old religion&quot; would be fun, in sharp contrast to the Hammer films they had both seen as horror film fans.

Shaffer read the David Pinner novel &quot;Ritual&quot;, in which a devout Christian policeman is called to investigate what appears to be the ritual murder of a young girl in a rural village, and decided that it would serve well as the source material for the project. Pinner had originally written &quot;Ritual&quot; as a film treatment for director Michael Winner, who had John Hurt in mind as a possible star. Winner eventually declined the project, so Pinner&#x27;s agent persuaded him to write &quot;Ritual&quot; as a novel instead. Shaffer and Lee paid Pinner £15,000 () for the rights to the novel, and Shaffer set to work on the screenplay. He soon decided that a direct adaptation would not work well, so drafted a new story based only loosely on the story of the novel.

Shaffer wanted the film to be &quot;a little more literate&quot; than the average horror picture. He specifically wanted a film with a minimum of violence and gore. He was tired of seeing horror films that relied almost entirely on viscera to be scary. The focus of the film was crystallised when he &quot;finally hit upon the abstract concept of sacrifice.&quot; The image of the wicker man, which gave the filmmakers their title, was taken from the description of the practice of human sacrifice by the Gauls in Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot;: &quot;Others have figures of vast size, the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with living men, which being set on fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames.&quot; For Shaffer, this was &quot;the most alarming and imposing image that I had ever seen.&quot; The idea of a confrontation between a modern Christian and a remote, pagan community continued to intrigue Shaffer, who performed painstaking research on paganism. Brainstorming with Hardy, they conceived the film as presenting the pagan elements objectively and accurately, accompanied by authentic music and a believable, contemporary setting. One of their main resources was &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, a study of mythology and religion written by Scottish anthropologist James Frazer.

===Casting===
Television actor Edward Woodward was cast in the role of Sergeant Neil Howie after the part was declined by both Michael York and David Hemmings. In Britain, Woodward was best known for the role of &quot;Callan&quot;, which he played from 1967 to 1972. After &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, Woodward went on to receive international attention for his roles in the 1980 film &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; and the 1980s TV series &quot;The Equalizer&quot;.

After Shaffer saw her on the stage, he lured Diane Cilento out of semi-retirement to play the town&#x27;s schoolmistress. (They lived together in Queensland from 1975, and married in 1985). Ingrid Pitt, another British horror film veteran, was cast as the town librarian and registrar. Swedish actress Britt Ekland was cast as the innkeeper&#x27;s lascivious daughter, although two body doubles were used for her naked scenes below the waist. Ekland found out that she was three months pregnant with her son Nic, to Lou Adler, two weeks into filming. Stuart Hopps (the film&#x27;s choreographer) called upon Lorraine Peters, a nightclub dancer from Glasgow, who gyrated at the doorway and against the wall of a bedroom in the fully nude &quot;wall&quot; scenes. Ekland&#x27;s speaking and singing voices were dubbed by Annie Ross and Rachel Verney respectively.

Local girl Jane Jackson was employed as Ekland&#x27;s stand-in for camera setups. Jackson was blonde-haired and bore a resemblance to Ekland but was otherwise not involved in any filming.

=== Filming ===

The film was produced at a time of crisis for the British film industry. The studio in charge of production, British Lion Films, was in financial trouble and was bought by wealthy businessman John Bentley. To convince the unions that he was not about to asset strip the company, Bentley needed to get a film into production quickly. This meant that although &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; was set in spring, filming actually began in October 1972; artificial leaves and blossoms had to be glued to trees in many scenes. The production was kept on a small budget. Christopher Lee was extremely keen to get the film made; he and others worked on the production without pay. While filming took place, British Lion was bought by EMI Films.

The film was shot almost entirely in the small Scottish towns of Stranraer, Gatehouse of Fleet, Newton Stewart, Kirkcudbright, Anwoth and Creetown in Galloway, as well as Plockton in Ross-shire. Some scenes were filmed in and around the Isle of Whithorn, where the owners of the castle, Elizabeth McAdam McLaughland and David Wheatley, plus several other local people, featured in various scenes. Culzean Castle in Ayrshire and its grounds and Floors Castle in Roxburghshire were also used for the shooting. Some of the opening flying shots feature the Isle of Skye, including the pinnacles of The Storr and the Quiraing. The interior cave scenes were filmed inside Wookey Hole in Somerset. Hush Heath Estate in Staplehurst, Kent, makes a brief appearance in the film, doubling as Lord Summerisle&#x27;s orchard and gardens. The climax of the film was shot at St Ninian&#x27;s Cave and on the clifftops at Burrow Head in Wigtownshire.

The amphibious aircraft that carries Sergeant Howie was a Thurston Teal, owned and flown in the aerial sequences by Christopher Murphy.

According to Britt Ekland, some animals perished in the wicker man, whereas Robin Hardy said in an interview that great care was taken to ensure that the animals were in no danger of being hurt during this scene, and that they were not inside the wicker man when it was set on fire.

===Music===

The score was arranged, recorded and part composed by Paul Giovanni. According to Seamus Flannery in a subsequent documentary, director Robin Hardy surprised the cast by suddenly announcing midway through filming that they were making a &quot;musical&quot;; performed by Magnet (in some versions of the film credited as &quot;Lodestone&quot;), the soundtrack contains 13 folk songs performed by characters in the film. Included are traditional songs, original compositions by Giovanni, and even a nursery rhyme, &quot;Baa, Baa, Black Sheep&quot;.

&quot;Willow&#x27;s Song&quot; has been covered or sampled by various rock music bands. It was first covered by an English musical project known as Nature and Organisation on their 1994 release &quot;Beauty Reaps the Blood of Solitude&quot;. It was covered by Sneaker Pimps as &quot;How Do&quot;, and is included on their 1996 release &quot;Becoming X&quot;. &quot;How Do&quot; can be heard in the movie &quot;Hostel&quot; (2005); credited in the end titles as being composed by Sneaker Pimps. Additionally, the band has covered &quot;Gently Johnny&quot; as &quot;Johnny&quot;; it is featured as a B-side on their single &quot;Roll On&quot; (1996). It also was covered by Faith and the Muse on their 2003 album &quot;The Burning Season&quot;, and The Mock Turtles on their album &quot;Turtle Soup&quot;.

The songs on the soundtrack were composed or arranged by Giovanni under the direction of Hardy and Shaffer, whose research into the oral folk tradition in England and Scotland was based largely on the work of Cecil Sharp, a &quot;founding father&quot; of the folk-revival movement of the early 20th century. Using Sharp&#x27;s collections as a template, Shaffer noted to Giovanni which scenes were to have music, and in some cases provided lyrics, which would be appropriate to spring pagan festivals. Other songs on the soundtrack come from a later folk tradition; for example, &quot;Corn Riggs&quot;, by Scotland&#x27;s national bard, Robert Burns, accompanies Howie&#x27;s arrival on Summerisle. The lyrics of this song were taken directly from the Burns song &quot;The Rigs of Barley&quot;, but Giovanni used a very different tune. Burns&#x27; tune was based on &quot;Corn Riggs&quot;, and altered to match his lyrics. The song sung by the cultists of Summerisle at the end of the film, &quot;Sumer Is Icumen In&quot;, is a mid-13th-century song about nature in spring.

The film also gave its name to the Wickerman Festival, an annual music festival held near Auchencairn in Galloway. Dubbed &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Alternative Music festival&quot;, it began in 2001 when the festival&#x27;s artistic director Sid Ambrose hit upon the idea of a local counterculture-based family-friendly festival due to the surrounding area being inextricably linked with various locations used within &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;. It was held annually until 2015 at East Kirkcarswell Farm, Dundrennan.

==Distribution==

By the time of the film&#x27;s completion, the studio had been bought by EMI, and British Lion was managed by Michael Deeley. The DVD commentary track states that studio executives suggested a more &quot;upbeat&quot; ending to the film, in which a sudden rain puts the flames of the wicker man out and spares Howie&#x27;s life, but this suggestion was refused. Hardy subsequently had to remove about 20 minutes of scenes on the mainland, early investigations, and (to Lee&#x27;s disappointment) some of Lord Summerisle&#x27;s initial meeting with Howie.

===Original release===
The first screening of the film was to trade and cinema distributors on 3 December 1973. The first public theatrical release was a week of test screenings at the Metropole Cinema London on 6 December 1973 ahead of the official public release in January 1974. It runs 87 minutes.

A copy of a finished, 99-minute version was sent to American film producer Roger Corman in Hollywood to make a judgment of how to market the film in the U.S. Corman recommended an additional 13 minutes be cut from the film. Corman did not acquire U.S. release rights, and eventually Warner Bros. test-marketed the film in drive-ins. It screened in the greater Atlanta area in May 1974.

In Britain, the film was cut to roughly 87 minutes, with some narrative restructuring, and released as the &quot;B&quot; picture on a double bill with &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;. According to Lee, the cuts adversely affected the film&#x27;s continuity.

===First restoration===
During the mid-1970s, Hardy made inquiries about the film, hoping to restore it to his original vision. Along with Lee and Shaffer, Hardy searched for his original cut, or raw footage. Both of these appeared to have been lost. Director Alex Cox said in his &quot;Moviedrome&quot; introduction in 1988 that the negative had &quot;ended up in the pylons that support the M4 motorway.&quot; Hardy recalled that a copy of the film made prior to Deeley&#x27;s cuts was sent to Roger Corman, who, it turned out, still had it, possibly the only existing print of Hardy&#x27;s original cut. The US rights had been sold by Warner Bros. to a small firm called Abraxas, managed by film buff Stirling Smith and critic John Alan Simon. Stirling agreed to an American release of a reconstruction by Hardy. Hardy restored the narrative structure, some of the erotic elements which had been excised, and a very brief pretitle segment of Howie on the mainland (appearing at a church with his fiancée). A 96-minute restored version was released in January 1979, again to critical acclaim.

===US VHS versions===
The original 99-minute version was available in the US on VHS home video from Media Home Entertainment (and later Magnum) during the 1980s and 1990s. This video includes additional early scenes set inside Howie&#x27;s police station, which Hardy had left out of the 1979 restoration. In 2001, a remaster of the 88-minute cut was released on VHS, labelled as the &quot;Theatrical Version&quot;.

===Director&#x27;s cut===
In 2001, the film&#x27;s new world rights owners, Canal+, tried to release the full-length film. Corman&#x27;s copy had been lost, but a telecine transfer to 1-inch videotape existed. Missing elements were combined with film elements from the previous versions (in particular, additional scenes of Howie on the mainland were restored, showing him to be the object of gossip at his police station, establishing his devout religiosity). The extended DVD cut was released by Canal+ (Anchor Bay Entertainment handling US DVD distribution) in this 99-minute hybrid, considered the longest and closest version to Hardy&#x27;s original 100-odd minute version. A two-disc limited edition set was sold with the shortened theatrical release, the new extended version and a documentary, &quot;The Wicker Man Enigma&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Inside the Wicker Man&quot; author Allan Brown revealed he had discovered stills taken on the set showing sequences from the script that had never been seen; it had never been certain that the scenes had been filmed. They include scenes where Howie closes a mainland pub open after hours, encounters a prostitute, has a massage from Willow McGregor, and sees a brutal confrontation between Oak and a villager in The Green Man, which were featured in a revised edition of &quot;Inside the Wicker Man&quot;. Anchor Bay released a limited-edition wooden box of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;. About 50,000 two-disc sets were made, of which 20 were signed by Lee and Woodward, Shaffer, Snell, and Hardy. In March 2002, Lee discussed the lost original cut, &quot;I still believe it exists somewhere, in cans with no name. I still believe that. But nobody&#x27;s ever seen it since, so we couldn&#x27;t re-cut it, re-edit it, which was what I wanted to do. It would have been ten times as good&quot;.

===&quot;The Final Cut&quot;===
European distributors of the film StudioCanal began a Facebook campaign in 2013 to find missing material, which culminated in the discovery of a 92-minute 35 mm print at the Harvard Film Archive. This print had previously been known as the &quot;Middle Version&quot; and was itself assembled from a 35 mm print of the original edit Robin Hardy had made in the United Kingdom in 1973, but which was never released. Robin Hardy believed that the original edit will probably never be found, saying, &quot;Sadly, it seems as though this has been lost forever. However, I am delighted that a 1979 Abraxas print has been found as I also put together this cut myself, and it crucially restores the story order to that which I had originally intended.&quot;

Hardy reported in July 2013 that Studiocanal intended to restore and release the most complete version possible of the film. Rialto Pictures announced that it was to release the new digital restoration in North American cinemas on 27 September 2013. This new version was also released on DVD on 13 October 2013. It is 91 minutes long, shorter than the director&#x27;s cut but longer than the theatrical cut, and is known as &quot;The Wicker Man: The Final Cut&quot;.

&quot;The Final Cut&quot; (UK) Blu-ray (2013) features short documentaries &quot;Burnt Offering: The Cult of the Wicker Man&quot;, &quot;Worshipping the Wicker Man&quot;, &quot;The Music of the Wicker Man&quot;, interviews with director Robin Hardy and actor Christopher Lee, a restoration comparison, and the theatrical trailer. The second disc features both the UK 87-minute theatrical cut and the 95-minute 2013 director&#x27;s cut, along with an audio commentary on the director&#x27;s cut and a making-of for the commentary. The third disc is the soundtrack to the film.

===50th Anniversary: 4K restorations, Final Cut screenings and &#x27;Musics from Summerisle&#x27; ===

In 2023, for the 50th anniversary of the film&#x27;s release, StudioCanal announced 4K resolution restoration of existing footage, and remastering of the existing three cuts for a &quot;4K Ultra HD Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; release on 25 September 2023.

On 21 June, the 4K restoration Final Cut was screened in cinemas across the UK along with a Q&amp;A filmed in London, hosted by Edith Bowman with guests including Britt Ekland, and Robin Hardy&#x27;s sons Julian and Dominic promoting their &quot;Wickermania!&quot; documentary.

On 24 June, the Barbican Centre held &quot;Musics from Summerisle&quot;, a live performance celebration of the anniversary.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
David McGillivray of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; praised the film as &quot;an immensely enjoyable piece of hokum, thoroughly well researched, performed and directed.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that Anthony Shaffer&#x27;s screenplay &quot;for sheer imagination and near-terror, has seldom been equalled.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a witty work of the macabre&quot; with &quot;the splendid performances typical of British films.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was more negative, calling it &quot;handsomely photographed&quot; with &quot;good performances,&quot; but &quot;something of a howl&quot; even though &quot;it seems to have been made in all seriousness.&quot;

&quot;The Wicker Man&quot; initially had moderate success and won the Golden Licorn for Best Film at the 1974 Paris International Festival of Fantastic and Science-Fiction Film, but largely slipped into obscurity. In 1977 the American film magazine &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; devoted a commemorative issue to the film, asserting that the film is &quot;the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of horror movies&quot; – an oft-quoted phrase attributed to this issue.

Decades after its release, the film still receives positive reviews from critics and is considered one of the best films of 1973. At the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; holds an 90% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating based on 61 reviews, with a weighted average score of 8/10 and the site&#x27;s consensus: &quot;This intelligent horror film is subtle in its thrills and chills, with an ending that is both shocking and truly memorable&quot;. In 2008, &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; was ranked by &quot;Empire&quot; at No. 485 of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. Christopher Lee considered &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; his best film. Similarly, Edward Woodward said that &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; was one of his favourite films and that the character of Howie was the best part he ever played. In addition to Lee&#x27;s admiration of the final shot of the film (of the collapsing wicker man), Woodward said that it is the best final shot of any film ever made. In 2010 &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper ranked it as No 4 in its &quot;25 best horror films of all time&quot; listings.

In his 2010 BBC documentary series &quot;A History of Horror&quot;, writer and actor Mark Gatiss referred to the film as a prime example of a short-lived subgenre he called &quot;folk horror&quot;, grouping it with 1968&#x27;s &quot;Witchfinder General&quot; and 1971&#x27;s &quot;The Blood on Satan&#x27;s Claw&quot;. In 2003, the Crichton Campus of the University of Glasgow in Dumfries hosted a three-day conference on &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, which resulted in the publication of two collections of papers about the film. In 2004, &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; ranked No, 45 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Popular culture==
The film brought the wicker man into modern popular culture. In recent times, a wicker man has been burnt at festivals such as Burning Man in the United States, and the former Wickerman Festival in Scotland.

In 1998, Swedish black metal band Marduk used a line from this film on the introduction to the track &quot;Slay The Nazarene&quot; from the album &quot;Nightwing&quot;.

In 2000, British heavy metal band Iron Maiden released a single called &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; in tribute to the film.

In 2016, British band Radiohead released the music video for the song &quot;Burn the Witch&quot;, made in stop-motion animation and whose storyline greatly resembles that of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;.

In 2001, British band Pulp released &quot;Wickerman&quot; on their &quot;We Love Life&quot; album, which features a sample of Willow&#x27;s Song.

&quot;The White&quot;, a 2008 EP by American extreme metal band Agalloch, included three tracks featuring samples of dialogue from the film: &quot;The Isle of Summer&quot;, &quot;Summerisle Reprise&quot;, and &quot;Sowilo Rune&quot; 

In the film &quot;Shallow Grave&quot;, Ewan McGregor&#x27;s character is shown watching the final scene, representing the building sense of doom the character is experiencing.

The creators of &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; television series often reference the film in their work, particularly in the &quot;Inside No. 9&quot; episode &#x27;Mr King&#x27;.

For Record Store Day 2024 &#x27;Katy J Pearson &amp; friends&#x27; released a 9 track EP &#x27;The Wicker Man&#x27; with covers of songs from the film. The EP, on Heavenly Recordings, (HVN72412) features collaborations with Broadside Hacks, Drug Store Romeos, Sarah Meth, Orbury Common, Evie Hilyer-Zietler, Bert Ussher, H.Hawkline plus special guests as well as remixes by Richard Norris and Stone Club.

A yearly Wicker Man festival is held in Fishtoft, Lincolnshire, featuring live music from Ian Cutler, who featured in the original film as the fiddle player. 

==Related works==

=== Novelisation ===
A novelisation, which expands on the story and bears the same title, was released in 1978. It was written by Hardy and Shaffer.

===Possible sequel===
In 1989, Shaffer wrote a 30-page film script treatment entitled &quot;The Loathsome Lambton Worm&quot;, a direct sequel to &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, for producer Lance Reynolds. It would have been more fantastical in subject matter than the original film, and relied more heavily on special effects. In this continuation of the story, which begins immediately after the ending of the first film, Sergeant Neil Howie is rescued from the burning Wicker Man by a group of police officers from the mainland. Howie sets out to bring Lord Summerisle and his pagan followers to justice, but becomes embroiled in a series of challenges which pit the old gods against his own Christian faith. The script culminates in a climactic battle between Howie and a fire-breathing dragon – the titular Lambton Worm – and ends with a suicidal Howie plunging to his death from a cliff while tied to two large eagles. Shaffer&#x27;s sequel was never produced, but his treatment, complete with illustrations, was eventually published in the companion book &quot;Inside The Wicker Man&quot;.

Hardy was not asked to direct the sequel, and never read the script, as he did not like the idea of Howie surviving the sacrifice, or the fact that the actors would have aged by 20 to 30 years between the two films. In May 2010, Hardy discussed &quot;The Loathsome Lambton Worm&quot;. &quot;I know Tony did write that, but I don&#x27;t think anyone particularly liked it, or it would have been made.&quot;

A fan-made full-cast audio drama adaptation of Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;The Loathsome Lambton Worm&quot; treatment was eventually released in 2020.

===Remake===
An American remake of the same name, starring Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn, and directed by Neil LaBute, was released in 2006. Hardy expressed concern about the remake.

===Stage production===
A stage adaptation was announced for the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and was directed by Andrew Steggall. The production was based jointly upon Anthony Shaffer&#x27;s original &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; script and David Pinner&#x27;s novel &quot;Ritual&quot;. Robin Hardy gave input on the project, and original songs and music from the film were supervised by Gary Carpenter, the original music director. Workshop rehearsals were held at The Drill Hall in London in March 2008, and a casting call was held in Glasgow in May 2009. After three weeks at the Pleasance in Edinburgh in August 2009, the production was to visit the Perth Rep, Eden Court Theatre in Inverness, and then have a short run at Citizen&#x27;s Theatre in Glasgow, with hopes for a run in London in 2010. However, in July 2009 it was announced that the production had been cancelled, three weeks before it had been due to preview.

In 2011, the National Theatre of Scotland produced &quot;An Appointment with the Wicker Man&quot; written by Greg Hemphill and Donald McCleary. The production has an amateur theatre company attempting to stage a &quot;Wicker Man&quot; musical.

===Spiritual sequel===
In 2011, a spiritual successor entitled &quot;The Wicker Tree&quot; was released. It was directed by Hardy and featured an appearance by Lee. Hardy first published the story as a novel, under the name &quot;Cowboys for Christ&quot;. First announced in April 2000, filming on the project began on 19 July 2009 according to IMDb. It follows two young American Christian evangelists who travel to Scotland; like Woodward&#x27;s character in &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, the two Americans are virgins who encounter a pagan laird and his followers. The film received mixed reviews.

Those involved in the production of the film have given conflicting statements regarding the identity of Christopher Lee&#x27;s character, referred to only as Old Gentleman in the credits. Writer/director Robin Hardy said that the ambiguity was intentional. Fans would immediately recognise Lee&#x27;s character as Lord Summerisle. Lee himself has contradicted this, stating that the two are not meant to be the same character, and that &quot;The Wicker Tree&quot; is not a sequel in any way.

===Audio adaptation===
A radio adaptation by Anthony D. P. Mann was produced by Bleak December Inc. in an arrangement with StudioCanal and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 2 December 2023 as part of a &quot;Wicker Man&quot;-themed evening of programmes. The cast included Mann as Sergeant Howie, Brian Blessed as Lord Summerisle, Laurence R. Harvey as MacGregor, Anne-Marie Bergman as Miss Rose, Melissa Radford as Willow and Mei Kiera as Rowan Morrison/Heather.

===Potential graphic novel and third film===
As a former artist, Hardy expressed great interest in the medium of comics, and planned a comic book which would retell the story of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, based on his own storyboards for the film. Hardy was in talks with yet unnamed artists to work on the project, as he found it too difficult to make the characters look consistent from one panel to the next. Hardy was working on his next film, &quot;The Wrath of the Gods&quot;, at the time of his death on 1 July 2016. He intended the graphic novel and the new film to be released at the same time in autumn 2013; however as of autumn 2014 neither had been released, and the film never started production.

===&quot;Wickermania!&quot; documentary===
In 2023, two of Robin Hardy&#x27;s sons, Justin and Dominic, announced that they had created a documentary about &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, called &quot;Wickermania!&quot;. They had already received permission and a discount from Canal+ to use existing film footage, and had a number of original documents related to the production. They were seeking to fund the release of the documentary, subsequently renamed &quot;Children of the Wicker Man&quot;, via Kickstarter.

===&quot;The Wicker Man: The Official Story of the Film&quot; book===
On 24 October 2023, a new behind-the-scenes book &quot;The Wicker Man: The Official Story of the Film&quot; was published by Titan Books and written by John Walsh, containing new interviews, photos and others materials from the film. It was licensed by the film&#x27;s rights holder StudioCanal.

=== &quot;Sing-along-a-Wickerman&quot; ===
British performers David Bramwell and Eliza Skelton host a travelling show entitled &quot;Sing-along-a-Wickerman&quot;, which includes many &quot;Wicker Man&quot;-themed activities culminating in a sing-along screening of the film. The show has been going since at least 2011, and has received positive reviews from news outlets such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Time Out&quot;. Director of the film Robin Hardy has attended and has been a part of several shows, calling it &quot;terrific fun.&quot;

<doc id="42314" wikidata="Q841440" url="?curid=42314" title="Naturalization">
<text>Naturalization (or naturalisation) is the legal act or process by which a non-national of a country acquires the nationality of that country after birth. The definition of naturalization by the International Organization for Migration of the United Nations excludes citizenship that is automatically acquired (e.g. at birth) or is acquired by declaration. Naturalization usually involves an application or a motion and approval by legal authorities. The rules of naturalization vary from country to country but typically include a promise to obey and uphold that country&#x27;s laws and taking and subscribing to an oath of allegiance, and may specify other requirements such as a minimum legal residency and adequate knowledge of the national dominant language or culture. To counter multiple citizenship, some countries require that applicants for naturalization renounce any other citizenship that they currently hold, but whether this renunciation actually causes loss of original citizenship, as seen by the host country and by the original country, will depend on the laws of the countries involved. Arguments for increasing naturalization include reducing backlogs in naturalization applications and reshaping the electorate of the country.

== History ==
The massive increase in population flux due to globalization and the sharp increase in the numbers of refugees following World War I created many stateless persons, people who were not citizens of any state. In some rare cases, laws for mass naturalization were passed. As naturalization laws had been designed to cater for the relatively few people who had voluntarily moved from one country to another (expatriates), many western democracies were not ready to naturalize large numbers of people. This included the massive influx of stateless people which followed massive denationalizations and the expulsion of ethnic minorities from newly created nation states in the first part of the 20th century.

Since World War II, the increase in international migrations created a new category of migrants, most of them economic migrants. For economic, political, humanitarian and pragmatic reasons, many states passed laws allowing a person to acquire their citizenship after birth, such as by marriage to a national – &quot;jus matrimonii&quot; – or by having ancestors who are nationals of that country, in order to reduce the scope of this category. However, in some countries this system still maintains a large part of the immigrant population in an illegal status, albeit with some massive regularizations. Examples include Spain under José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&#x27;s government, and Italy under Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s government.

== Countries without a path to naturalization ==

Myanmar and Uruguay are currently the only countries in the world that deny immigrants any path to naturalization. Uruguayan legal citizenship has special characteristics. A person who acquires it retains their nationality of origin, which is determined by Uruguayan law to be that of their country of birth and therefore, is immutable. Legal citizens acquire political rights but do not acquire Uruguayan nationality as natural citizens do. According to Uruguayan law, those born in Uruguay or whose parents or grandparents are Uruguayan natural citizens are considered to be Uruguayan nationals.

As a result of Uruguay&#x27;s unusual distinction between citizenship and nationality (it is the only country in the world that recognizes the right to citizenship without being a national), legal citizens have encountered problems with their Uruguayan passports at airports around the world since 2015. This is due to recommendations in the seventh edition of Doc. 9303 of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which requires that travel documents issued by participating states include the &quot;Nationality&quot; field. The lack of a naturalization path means that the Nationality field in legal citizens&#x27; passports indicates their country of birth, which Uruguay assumes to be their nationality of origin. Many countries do not accept passports issued by a country that declares the holder to be a national of another country. As a consequence, it has severely curtailed legal citizens&#x27; exercise of the right to free movement, as their travel abroad is often difficult or downright impossible.

Due to its current and narrow definition of nationality, Uruguay could be violating the sovereignty of other countries by assigning foreign nationalities in its official documents, thus overriding their powers. Some Uruguayan legal citizens may even, as a result of the application of a national law of a third nation and this Uruguayan interpretation, become &quot;de facto&quot; stateless.

== Summary by country ==
The following list is a brief summary of the duration of legal residence before a national of a foreign state, without any cultural, historical, or marriage ties or connections to the state in question, can request citizenship under that state&#x27;s naturalization laws.

== Laws by country ==

===Australia===

The &quot;Australian Citizenship Act 1973&quot; ended the preferential treatment for British subjects from 1 December 1973. People who became permanent residents from 1 July 2007 must have been lawfully resident in Australia for four years before applying for citizenship by conferral. Those who were present in Australia as permanent residents before 1 July 2007 remain subject to the previous residence requirement (in force since 1984, e.g. resident for two years).

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
The People&#x27;s Republic of China gives citizenship to people with one or two parents with Chinese nationality who have not taken residence in other countries. The country also gives citizenship to people born on its territory to stateless people who have settled there. Furthermore, individuals may apply for nationality if they have a near relative with Chinese nationality, if they have settled in China, or if they present another legitimate reason. In practice, few people gain Chinese citizenship; as of 2010, China had only 1,448 naturalised Chinese in total.

The naturalization process starts with a written application. Applicants must submit three copies, written with a ball-point or fountain pen, to national authorities, and to provincial authorities in the Ministry of Public Security and the Public Security Bureau. Applicants must also submit original copies of a foreign passport, a residence permit, a permanent residence permit, and four two-and-a-half inch long pictures. According to the conditions outlined in the Nationality Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, authorities may also require &quot;any other material that the authority believes are related to the nationality application&quot;.

=== France ===

People who fulfil all of the following criteria can obtain French citizenship through naturalisation:

* At least 5 years&#x27; residence, although reduced to the following minimum periods in certain situations:
** 2 years:
*** Successfully completed 2 years of studies with a view to obtaining a degree or diploma at a French higher educational institution;
*** Made an exceptional contribution to France&#x27;s standing and influence in the arts, science, sport, culture, academia, entrepreneurship, etc.
** No minimum residence period:
*** Performed military service with the French Army;
*** Served voluntarily in wartime in the French Army or an allied army;
*** Rendered exceptional service to France (requires personal ministerial approval);
*** Attained the official status of a refugee in France;
*** Citizen of a member state of the and have French as their native language or have completed at least 5 years of schooling in a French-speaking educational establishment.
* Integration into French society, including adhering to the values and principles of the Republic, and having a sufficient knowledge of French history, culture and society;
* Sufficient spoken command of the French language;
* No serious criminal convictions, defined as follows:
** Never been sentenced to more than 6 months&#x27; imprisonment (not including suspended sentences) for any crime (unless the applicant has been legally deemed rehabilitated or the sentence has been wiped from their criminal record);
** Never been convicted of any crime that counters France&#x27;s fundamental interests (unless the applicant has been legally deemed rehabilitated or the sentence has been wiped from their criminal record);
** Never been convicted of any act of terrorism (unless the applicant has been legally deemed rehabilitated or the sentence has been wiped from their criminal record).

The fee for naturalisation is €55, except in French Guiana, where it is €27.50.

=== Germany ===
People who fulfil all of the following criteria can obtain German citizenship through naturalisation:

* At least 8 years&#x27; residence in Germany with a valid residence permit. This minimum period is reduced as follows:
** 7 years for people who have successfully completed the Integrationskurs;
** 3 years for spouses and registered same-sex partners of a German citizen (must have been married or in the registered partnership for at least 2 years at the time of application).
* Declaring allegiance to the German Constitution;
* Sufficient command of the German language;
* No serious criminal convictions.
The dependent minor children of an applicant for naturalisation may also themselves become naturalised German citizens.

The fee for standard naturalisation is €255, while it is €51 per dependent minor child naturalised along with their parent. The fee may be waived in cases of extreme hardship or public interest.

People who naturalise as German citizens must usually give up their previous nationality, as German law takes a restrictive approach to multiple citizenship. Exceptions are made for EU and Swiss citizens (provided that the law of their country of origin does not prohibit the acquisition of another citizenship) and citizens of countries where renouncing one&#x27;s citizenship is too difficult or humiliating (e.g. Afghanistan), prohibitively expensive (e.g. the United States) or legally impossible (e.g. Argentina).

=== Grenada ===
The Grenadian Government grants citizenship of Grenada for the following reasons:

*By Birth
**Any person born in Grenada after 1974 or later acquires Grenadian citizenship at birth. The exception is for children born to diplomat parents.
*By Descent
**Children born outside Grenada to a Grenadian-born parent.
*By Registration
**Children (over 18) born outside of Grenada to a Grenadian parent.
**Children (under 18) born outside of Grenada to a Grenadian parent.
**A person who was born outside of Grenada who is a Grandchild of a Grenadian citizen by birth.
**A person who is/or has been married to a citizen of Grenada.
** Citizens of Caribbean Countries may apply for citizenship by registration provided that person has been living in Grenada for 4 years and 2 years as a Permanent Resident (within the four-year period) immediately preceding the date of application.
**Commonwealth &amp; Irish citizens may apply for citizenship by registration provided that the person has been living in Grenada for 7 years and 2 years as a Permanent Resident (within the seven-year period) immediately preceding the date of application.
*By Naturalisation
*An Alien or a British Protected Person may apply for citizenship by naturalisation provided that the person has been living in Grenada for 7 years and 2 years as a Permanent Resident (within the seven-year period) immediately preceding the date of application..

===India===

The Indian citizenship and nationality law and the Constitution of India provides single citizenship for the entire country. The provisions relating to citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution are contained in Articles 5 to 11 in Part II of the Constitution of India. Relevant Indian legislation is the Citizenship Act 1955, which has been amended by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1986, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1992, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003, and Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2005. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003 received the assent of the President of India on 7 January 2004 and came into force on 3 December 2004. The Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2005 was promulgated by the President of India and came into force on 28 June 2005.

Following these reforms, Indian nationality law largely follows the &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; (citizenship by right of blood) as opposed to the &quot;jus soli&quot; (citizenship by right of birth within the territory).

In 2019, a Citizenship Amendment Act was passed by the Parliament of India. This Act aims at fast tracking citizenship for illegal immigrants and refugees fleeing religious persecution for people of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian faiths who have entered India on or before 31 December 2014 from the neighbouring countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

===Italy===

The Italian Government grants Italian citizenship for the following reasons.

*Automatically
**Jus sanguinis: for birth;
**If an Italian citizen recognizes, at a time after birth, a minor child;
**For adoption;
**To obtain or re-obtain from a parent.
*Following declaration
**By descent;
**Jus soli: by birth or descent in Italy;
*By marriage or naturalization
**By marriage: the foreign or stateless spouse of an Italian citizen may acquire Italian citizenship after two years of legal residence in Italy or, if residing abroad, after three years from the date of marriage;
**By naturalization: the foreigner can apply for Italian citizenship after ten years of legal residence in Italy, reduced to five years for those who have been recognized as stateless or refugee and four years for citizens of countries of the European Community.
* Sufficient command of the Italian language.

===Indonesia===

Indonesian nationality is regulated by Law No. 12/2006 (UU No. 12 Tahun 2006). The Indonesian nationality law is based on jus sanguinis and jus soli. The Indonesian nationality law does not recognize dual citizenship except for people under the age of 18 (limited double citizenship principle). After reaching 18 years of age individuals are forced to choose one citizenship (single citizenship principle).

A foreign citizen can apply to become an Indonesian citizen with the following requirements:
* Age 18 or older, or married
* Resided in Indonesia for a minimum of 5 consecutive years or 10 non-consecutive years
* Physically and mentally healthy
* Ability to speak Indonesian and acknowledge Pancasila and Undang-Undang Dasar Negara Republik Indonesia Tahun 1945
* Never convicted of a crime for which the punishment is imprisonment for one year or more
* If having Indonesian citizenship will not give the person dual citizenship
* Employed or have fixed income
* Pay citizenship fee

Any application for citizenship is granted by the President of Indonesia.

===Israel===

Israel&#x27;s Declaration of Independence was made on 14 May 1948, the day before the British Mandate was due to expire as a result of the United Nations Partition Plan. The Israeli parliament created two laws regarding immigration, citizenship and naturalization: the Law of Return and the Israeli citizenship law. The Law of Return, enacted on July 15, 1950, gives Jews living anywhere in the world the right to immigrate to Israel. This right to immigrate did not and still does not grant citizenship. In fact, for four years after Israel gained independence, there were no Israeli citizens.

On July 14, 1952, the Israeli parliament enacted the Israeli Nationality Law. The Nationality Law naturalized all citizens of Mandated Palestine, the inhabitants of Israel on July 15, 1952, and those who had legally resided in Israel between May 14, 1948, and July 14, 1952. The law further clarified that naturalization was available to immigrants who had arrived before Israel&#x27;s creation, immigrants who arrived after statehood was granted, and those who did not come to Israel as immigrants but have since expressed desire to settle in Israel, with restriction. Naturalization applicants must also meet the following requirements: be over 18 years of age, have resided in Israel for three out of the five preceding years, have settled or intend to settle permanently in Israel, have some knowledge of Hebrew, and have renounced prior nationality or demonstrated ability to renounce nationality after becoming a citizen of Israel.

Because of Israel&#x27;s relatively new and culturally mixed identity, Israel does not grant citizenship to people born on Israeli soil. Instead, the government chose to enact a jus sanguinis system, with the naturalization restrictions listed above. There is currently no legislation on second-generation immigrants (those born in Israel to immigrant parents). Furthermore, foreign spouses can apply for citizenship through the Minister of the Interior, but have a variety of restrictions and are not guaranteed citizenship.

=== Luxembourg ===

People who fulfil all of the following criteria can obtain Luxembourg citizenship through naturalisation:

* At least 18 years old.
* At least 5 years of legal residence in Luxembourg, including an uninterrupted period of one year immediately before applying for citizenship.
* Passing a Luxembourgish language exam.
* Taking a course on &quot;Living together in the Grand Duchy&quot; and passing the associated examination.
* Never having been handed an immediate custodial sentence of 12 months or more or a suspended custodial sentence of 24 months or more, in any country.

===Malaysia===

Naturalisation in Malaysia is guided by the 1964 Malaysian Constitution. According to the law, those who want to be the country citizen should live in the country for a period of 10–12 years. The would-be-citizens are required to speak the Malay language as well submitting the identity cards of two Malaysians who recommend the applicant for citizenship. As the Government of Malaysia does not recognise dual citizenship, those who seek naturalisation are needed to reside permanently in the country and renouncing their former country citizenship.

The requirements are as follows:
* The applicant shall appear before the Registrar of Citizenship when submitting the application.
* The applicant must be aged 21 years and above on the date of the application.
* The applicant has resided in the federation for a period of not less than 10 years in a period of 12 years, including the 12 months immediately preceding the date of application.
* The applicant intends to reside permanently in the federation.
* The applicant is of good character.
* The applicant has adequate knowledge of the Malay language.
* The applicant must be sponsored by two referees who are citizens aged 21 years and above and who are not relatives, not hired people, and not advocates or solicitors to the applicant.
* Form C must be completed and submitted together with copies of the necessary documents.

The Article 16 of 1957 Malaysian Constitution also stated a similar condition previously.

===Philippines===

Commonwealth Act No. 473, the Revised Naturalization Law, approved June 17, 1939, provided that people having certain specified qualifications may become a citizen of the Philippines by naturalization. Republic Act No. 9139, approved June 8, 2001, provided that aliens under the age of 18 who were born in the Philippines, who have resided in the Philippines since birth, and who possess other specified qualifications may be granted Philippines citizenship by administrative proceeding subject to certain requirements.

===Russia===

Naturalization in Russia is guided by articles 13 and 14 of the federal law &quot;About Citizenship of Russian Federation&quot; passed on May 31, 2002. Citizenship of Russia can be obtained in general or simplified order. To become a citizen in general order, one must be 18 years of age or older, continuously live in Russia as a permanent resident for at least five years (this term is limited to one year for valued specialists, political asylum seekers and refugees), have legal means of existence, promise to obey the laws and Constitution of Russia and be fluent in the Russian language.

There is also a possibility to naturalize in a simplified order, in which certain requirements will be waived. Eligible for that are people, at least one parent of whom is a Russian citizen living on Russian territory; people, who lived on the territories of the former Soviet republics but never obtained citizenships of those nations after they gained independence; people, who were born on the territory of RSFSR and formerly held Soviet citizenship; people married to Russian citizens for at least 3 years; people, who served in Russian Armed Forces under contract for at least 3 years; parents of mentally incapacitated children over 18 who are Russian citizens; participants of the State Program for Assisting Compatriots Residing Abroad; and some other categories.

===Spain===

People who fulfill all of the following criteria can obtain Spanish citizenship through naturalisation
* At least 10 years&#x27; residence in Spain. This period is reduced to 5 years for people who have obtained refugee status; 2 years for nationals of Ibero-American countries, Andorra, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, Portugal or persons of Sephardic origin; 1 year for spouses, widows, widowers, people born in Spain or by a Spanish mother or father. 
* Sufficient command of the Spanish language and culture;
* Declaring allegiance to the Spanish Constitution;
* No serious criminal convictions.

People who naturalise as Spanish citizens must usually give up their previous nationality, as Spanish law takes a restrictive approach to multiple citizenship.

===South Africa===

Chapter 2 of the South African Citizenship Act, enacted on October 6, 1995, defines who is considered a naturalized citizen at the time of the act and also outlines the naturalization process for future immigrants.

Any person who immediately prior to the commencement of the act had been a South African citizen via naturalization, had been deemed to be a South African citizen by registration, or had been a citizen via naturalization of any of the former states now composing South Africa is now considered to be a naturalized citizen of South Africa.

Those wishing to apply for naturalization in the future must apply to the Minister of Home Affairs and must meet a slew of requirements. First, naturalization applicants must be over the age of 18 and must have been a permanent resident of South Africa for five years prior to application (prior to 2010, the permanent residence requirement was one year prior to application and for four out of the eight years prior to application). Applicants must also demonstrate good character and knowledge of the basic responsibilities and privileges of a South African citizen. The ability to communicate in one of the official languages of South Africa is also required. Applicants must show the intention to reside in South Africa after naturalization, and they are required to make a declaration of allegiance. The Constitution of South Africa states that national legislation must provide for the acquisition, loss and restoration of citizenship.

Being a naturalized South African citizen is a privilege, not a right. Even after meeting all the requirements and going through the naturalization process, the minister holds the right to deny citizenship. Foreign spouses of South African citizens can apply for naturalization after two years of marriage, but is subject to potential denial of the minister. The minister can also grant citizenship to minors, if their parent applies for them.

The minister also holds the power to revoke naturalization at any time for specific reasons listed in the Act. Reasons for revoking the naturalization certificate include marrying someone who is a citizen of another country and holding citizenship in another country, or applying for citizenship of another country without prior authorization for retention of citizenship. If a permanent resident is denied naturalization, he or she must wait at least one year before reapplying.

===United Kingdom===

There has always been a distinction in the law of England and Wales between the subjects of the monarch and aliens: the monarch&#x27;s subjects owed the monarch allegiance, and included those born in his or her dominions (natural-born subjects) and those who later gave him or her their allegiance (naturalised subjects). Today, the requirements for naturalisation as a citizen of the United Kingdom depend on whether or not one is the spouse or civil partner of a citizen. An applicant who is a spouse or civil partner of a British citizen must:
* hold indefinite leave to remain in the UK (or an equivalent such as Right of Abode or Irish citizenship)
* have lived legally in the UK for three years
* been outside of the UK no more than 90 days during the one-year period prior to filing the application.
* show sufficient knowledge of life in the UK, either by passing the Life in the United Kingdom test or by attending combined English language and citizenship classes. Proof of this must be supplied with one&#x27;s application for naturalisation. Those aged 65 or over may be able to claim exemption.
* meet specified English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic language competence standards.

For those not married to or in a civil partnership with a British citizen, the requirements are:
* Five years legal residence in the UK
* Indefinite leave to remain or &quot;equivalent&quot; for this purpose (see above) must have been held for 12 months
* the applicant must intend to continue to live in the UK or work overseas for the UK government or a British corporation or association
* the same &quot;good character&quot; standards apply as for those married to British citizens
* the same language and knowledge of life in the UK standards apply as for those married to British citizens.

===United States===
Persons who are not US citizens may receive citizenship through the process of naturalization, following the Congressional requirements in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Naturalized citizens have the same rights as those who acquired citizenship at birth.

The INA states the following:


The Naturalization Act of 1795 set the initial rules on naturalization: &quot;free, White persons&quot; who had been resident for five years or more. An 1862 law allowed honorably discharged Army veterans of any war to petition for naturalization after only one year of residence in the United States. An 1894 law extended the same privilege to honorably discharged five-year veterans of the Navy or Marine Corps. Laws enacted in 1919, 1926, 1940, and 1952 continued preferential treatment provisions for veterans.

Following the Spanish–American War in 1898, Philippine citizens were classified as US nationals, and the 1917 Jones–Shafroth Act granted US citizenship to natives of Puerto Rico. But the 1934 Tydings–McDuffie Act reclassified Filipinos as aliens, and set a quota of 50 immigrants per year, and otherwise applying the Immigration Act of 1924 to them.

The Magnuson Act repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. During the 1940s, 100 annual immigrants from British India and the Philippines were allowed. The War Brides Act of 1945 permitted soldiers to bring back their foreign wives and established precedent in naturalization through marriage. The Immigration Act of 1965 finally allowed people from all nations to be given equal access to immigration and naturalization.

Illegal immigration became a major issue in the United States at the end of the 20th century. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, while tightening border controls, also provided the opportunity of naturalization for illegal aliens who had been in the country for at least four years. Today, lawful permanent residents of the United States are eligible to apply for US citizenship after five years, unless they continue to be married to a US citizen, in which case they can apply after only three years of permanent residency.

The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 streamlined the naturalization process for children adopted internationally. A child under age 18 who is adopted by at least one US citizen parent, and is in the custody of the citizen parent(s), is now automatically naturalized once admitted to the United States as an immigrant or when legally adopted in the United States, depending on the visa under which the child was admitted to the United States. The Act also provides that the non-citizen minor child of a newly naturalized US citizen, whether by birth or adoption, also automatically receives US citizenship.

== Mass naturalizations ==
A few rare mass naturalization processes have been implemented by nation states. In 1891, Brazil granted naturalization to all aliens living in the country. In 1922, Greece massively naturalized all the Greek refugees coming from Turkey. The second massive naturalization process was in favor of Armenian refugees coming from Turkey, who went to Syria, Lebanon or other former Ottoman countries. Reciprocally, Turkey massively naturalized the refugees of Turkish descent or other ethnic backgrounds in Muslim creed from these countries during a redemption process.

Canada instituted a mass naturalization by Act of Parliament with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act 1946.

After annexation of the territories east of the Curzon line by the Soviet Union in 1945, Soviets naturalized &quot;en masse&quot; all the inhabitants of those territories—including ethnic Poles, as well as its other citizens who had been deported into the Soviet Union, mainly to Kazakhstan. Those people were forcibly naturalized as Soviet citizens. Later on, Germany granted to the ethnic German population in Russia and Kazakhstan full citizenship rights. Poland has a limited repatriation program in place.

In the late 1970s, President Ferdinand Marcos facilitated the mass naturalization of ethnic Chinese in the Philippines.

The most recent massive naturalization case resulted from the Argentine economic crisis in the beginning of the 21st century. Existing or slightly updated right of return laws in Spain and Italy allowed many of their diasporic descendants to obtain—in many cases to regain—naturalization in virtue of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;, as in the Greek case. Hence, many Argentines acquired European nationality.

Since the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution grants citizenship only to those &quot;born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot;, and the original United States Constitution only grants Congress the power of naturalization, it could be argued that all acts of Congress that expand the right of citizenship are cases of mass naturalization. This includes the acts that extended U.S. citizenship to citizens of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 which made all Native Americans citizens (most of them were previously excluded under the &quot;jurisdiction&quot; clause of the 14th Amendment).

In the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah, mass naturalisation also happened during the administration of United Sabah National Organisation (USNO) and Sabah People&#x27;s United Front (BERJAYA&#x27;s) Muslim-dominated political parties to increase the Muslim population in the territory by naturalising immigrants and refugees from the mainly-Muslim dominated areas of Mindanao and Sulu Archipelago of the Philippines and Sulawesi of Indonesia.

=== In occupied territories ===
The mass naturalization of native people in occupied territories is illegal under the laws of war (Hague and Geneva Conventions). However, there have been many instances of such illegal mass naturalizations in the 20th century.

<text>In mathematics, topological groups are the combination of groups and topological spaces, i.e. they are groups and topological spaces at the same time, such that the continuity condition for the group operations connects these two structures together and consequently they are not independent from each other.

Topological groups were studied extensively in the period of 1925 to 1940. Haar and Weil (respectively in 1933 and 1940) showed that the integrals and Fourier series are special cases of a construct that can be defined on a very wide class of topological groups.

Topological groups, along with continuous group actions, are used to study continuous symmetries, which have many applications, for example, in physics. In functional analysis, every topological vector space is an additive topological group with the additional property that scalar multiplication is continuous; consequently, many results from the theory of topological groups can be applied to functional analysis.

== Formal definition ==

A topological group, , is a topological space that is also a group such that the group operation (in this case product):
and the inversion map:
are continuous. 
Here is viewed as a topological space with the product topology. 
Such a topology is said to be compatible with the group operations and is called a group topology.

;Checking continuity

The product map is continuous if and only if for any and any neighborhood of in , there exist neighborhoods of and of in such that , where }. 
The inversion map is continuous if and only if for any and any neighborhood of in , there exists a neighborhood of in such that , where }.

To show that a topology is compatible with the group operations, it suffices to check that the map
is continuous. 
Explicitly, this means that for any and any neighborhood in of , there exist neighborhoods of and of in such that .

;Additive notation

This definition used notation for multiplicative groups; 
the equivalent for additive groups would be that the following two operations are continuous: 
:, .

;Hausdorffness

Although not part of this definition, many authors require that the topology on be Hausdorff. 
One reason for this is that any topological group can be canonically associated with a Hausdorff topological group by taking an appropriate canonical quotient; 
this however, often still requires working with the original non-Hausdorff topological group.
Other reasons, and some equivalent conditions, are discussed below.

This article will not assume that topological groups are necessarily Hausdorff.

;Category

In the language of category theory, topological groups can be defined concisely as group objects in the category of topological spaces, in the same way that ordinary groups are group objects in the category of sets. 
Note that the axioms are given in terms of the maps (binary product, unary inverse, and nullary identity), hence are categorical definitions.

=== Homomorphisms ===

A homomorphism of topological groups means a continuous group homomorphism . 
Topological groups, together with their homomorphisms, form a category. 
A group homomorphism between topological groups is continuous if and only if it is continuous at &quot;some&quot; point.

An isomorphism of topological groups is a group isomorphism that is also a homeomorphism of the underlying topological spaces. 
This is stronger than simply requiring a continuous group isomorphism—the inverse must also be continuous. 
There are examples of topological groups that are isomorphic as ordinary groups but not as topological groups. 
Indeed, any non-discrete topological group is also a topological group when considered with the discrete topology. 
The underlying groups are the same, but as topological groups there is not an isomorphism.

== Examples ==

Every group can be trivially made into a topological group by considering it with the discrete topology; such groups are called discrete groups. 
In this sense, the theory of topological groups subsumes that of ordinary groups. 
The indiscrete topology (i.e. the trivial topology) also makes every group into a topological group.

The real numbers, formula_1 with the usual topology form a topological group under addition. 
Euclidean -space is also a topological group under addition, and more generally, every topological vector space forms an (abelian) topological group. 
Some other examples of abelian topological groups are the circle group , or the torus for any natural number .

The classical groups are important examples of non-abelian topological groups. For instance, the general linear group of all invertible -by- matrices with real entries can be viewed as a topological group with the topology defined by viewing as a subspace of Euclidean space . 
Another classical group is the orthogonal group , the group of all linear maps from to itself that preserve the length of all vectors. 
The orthogonal group is compact as a topological space. Much of Euclidean geometry can be viewed as studying the structure of the orthogonal group, or the closely related group of isometries of .

The groups mentioned so far are all Lie groups, meaning that they are smooth manifolds in such a way that the group operations are smooth, not just continuous. 
Lie groups are the best-understood topological groups; many questions about Lie groups can be converted to purely algebraic questions about Lie algebras and then solved.

An example of a topological group that is not a Lie group is the additive group formula_2 of rational numbers, with the topology inherited from formula_1. 
This is a countable space, and it does not have the discrete topology. 
An important example for number theory is the group of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers, for a prime number , meaning the inverse limit of the finite groups as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity. 
The group is well behaved in that it is compact (in fact, homeomorphic to the Cantor set), but it differs from (real) Lie groups in that it is totally disconnected. 
More generally, there is a theory of &quot;p&quot;-adic Lie groups, including compact groups such as as well as locally compact groups such as , where is the locally compact field of &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers.

The group is a pro-finite group; it is isomorphic to a subgroup of the product formula_4 in such a way that its topology is induced by the product topology, where the finite groups formula_5 are given the discrete topology. 
Another large class of pro-finite groups important in number theory are absolute Galois groups.

Some topological groups can be viewed as infinite dimensional Lie groups; this phrase is best understood informally, to include several different families of examples. 
For example, a topological vector space, such as a Banach space or Hilbert space, is an abelian topological group under addition. Some other infinite-dimensional groups that have been studied, with varying degrees of success, are loop groups, Kac–Moody groups, Diffeomorphism groups, homeomorphism groups, and gauge groups.

In every Banach algebra with multiplicative identity, the set of invertible elements forms a topological group under multiplication. 
For example, the group of invertible bounded operators on a Hilbert space arises this way.

== Properties ==

=== Translation invariance ===

Every topological group&#x27;s topology is , which by definition means that if for any formula_6 left or right multiplication by this element yields a homeomorphism formula_7 
Consequently, for any formula_8 and formula_9 the subset formula_10 is open (resp. closed) in formula_11 if and only if this is true of its left translation formula_12 and right translation formula_13
If formula_14 is a neighborhood basis of the identity element in a topological group formula_11 then for all formula_16
formula_17
is a neighborhood basis of formula_18 in formula_19 
In particular, any group topology on a topological group is completely determined by any neighborhood basis at the identity element. 
If formula_10 is any subset of formula_11 and formula_22 is an open subset of formula_23 then formula_24 is an open subset of formula_19

=== Symmetric neighborhoods ===

The inversion operation formula_26 on a topological group formula_11 is a homeomorphism from formula_11 to itself. 

A subset formula_29 is said to be symmetric if formula_30 where formula_31 
The closure of every symmetric set in a commutative topological group is symmetric. 
If is any subset of a commutative topological group , then the following sets are also symmetric: , , and .

For any neighborhood in a commutative topological group of the identity element, there exists a symmetric neighborhood of the identity element such that , where note that is necessarily a symmetric neighborhood of the identity element. 
Thus every topological group has a neighborhood basis at the identity element consisting of symmetric sets.

If is a locally compact commutative group, then for any neighborhood in of the identity element, there exists a symmetric relatively compact neighborhood of the identity element such that (where is symmetric as well).

=== Uniform space ===

Every topological group can be viewed as a uniform space in two ways; the &quot;left uniformity&quot; turns all left multiplications into uniformly continuous maps while the &quot;right uniformity&quot; turns all right multiplications into uniformly continuous maps.
If is not abelian, then these two need not coincide. 
The uniform structures allow one to talk about notions such as completeness, uniform continuity and uniform convergence on topological groups.

=== Separation properties ===

If is an open subset of a commutative topological group and contains a compact set , then there exists a neighborhood of the identity element such that .

As a uniform space, every commutative topological group is completely regular. 
Consequently, for a multiplicative topological group with identity element 1, the following are equivalent: 
A subgroup of a commutative topological group is discrete if and only if it has an isolated point.

If is not Hausdorff, then one can obtain a Hausdorff group by passing to the quotient group , where is the closure of the identity. 
This is equivalent to taking the Kolmogorov quotient of .

=== Metrisability ===

Let be a topological group. As with any topological space, we say that is metrisable if and only if there exists a metric on , which induces the same topology on formula_11. A metric on is called

* &quot;left-invariant&quot; (resp. &quot;right-invariant&quot;) if and only if formula_33(resp. formula_34) for all formula_35 (equivalently, formula_36 is left-invariant just in case the map formula_37 is an isometry from formula_38 to itself for each formula_8).
* &quot;proper&quot; if and only if all open balls, formula_40 for formula_41, are pre-compact.
The Birkhoff–Kakutani theorem (named after mathematicians Garrett Birkhoff and Shizuo Kakutani) states that the following three conditions on a topological group are equivalent:

# is (Hausdorff and) first countable (equivalently: the identity element 1 is closed in , and there is a countable basis of neighborhoods for 1 in ).
# is metrisable (as a topological space).
# There is a left-invariant metric on that induces the given topology on .
# There is a right-invariant metric on that induces the given topology on .

Furthermore, the following are equivalent for any topological group :

# is a second countable locally compact (Hausdorff) space.
# is a Polish, locally compact (Hausdorff) space.
# is properly metrisable (as a topological space).
# There is a left-invariant, proper metric on that induces the given topology on .

Note: As with the rest of the article we of assume here a Hausdorff topology.
The implications 4 formula_42 3 formula_42 2 formula_42 1 hold in any topological space. In particular 3 formula_42 2 holds, since in particular any properly metrisable space is countable union of compact metrisable and thus separable (&quot;cf.&quot; properties of compact metric spaces) subsets.
The non-trivial implication 1 formula_42 4 was first proved by Raimond Struble in 1974. An alternative approach was made by Uffe Haagerup and Agata Przybyszewska in 2006,
the idea of the which is as follows:
One relies on the construction of a left-invariant metric, formula_47, as in the case of first countable spaces. By local compactness, closed balls of sufficiently small radii are compact, and by normalising we can assume this holds for radius 1. Closing the open ball, , of radius 1 under multiplication yields a clopen subgroup, , of , on which the metric formula_47 is proper. Since is open and is second countable, the subgroup has at most countably many cosets. One now uses this sequence of cosets and the metric on to construct a proper metric on .

=== Subgroups ===

Every subgroup of a topological group is itself a topological group when given the subspace topology. 
Every open subgroup is also closed in , since the complement of is the open set given by the union of open sets for . 
If is a subgroup of then the closure of is also a subgroup. 
Likewise, if is a normal subgroup of , the closure of is normal in .

=== Quotients and normal subgroups ===

If is a subgroup of , the set of left cosets with the quotient topology is called a homogeneous space for . 
The quotient map formula_49 is always open. 
For example, for a positive integer , the sphere is a homogeneous space for the rotation group in , with . 
A homogeneous space is Hausdorff if and only if is closed in . 
Partly for this reason, it is natural to concentrate on closed subgroups when studying topological groups.

If is a normal subgroup of , then the quotient group becomes a topological group when given the quotient topology. 
It is Hausdorff if and only if is closed in . 
For example, the quotient group is isomorphic to the circle group .

In any topological group, the identity component (i.e., the connected component containing the identity element) is a closed normal subgroup. 
If is the identity component and &quot;a&quot; is any point of , then the left coset is the component of containing &quot;a&quot;. 
So the collection of all left cosets (or right cosets) of in is equal to the collection of all components of . 
It follows that the quotient group is totally disconnected.

=== Closure and compactness ===

In any commutative topological group, the product (assuming the group is multiplicative) of a compact set and a closed set is a closed set. 
Furthermore, for any subsets and of , .

If is a subgroup of a commutative topological group and if is a neighborhood in of the identity element such that is closed, then is closed. 
Every discrete subgroup of a Hausdorff commutative topological group is closed.

=== Isomorphism theorems ===

The isomorphism theorems from ordinary group theory are not always true in the topological setting. 
This is because a bijective homomorphism need not be an isomorphism of topological groups. 

For example, a native version of the first isomorphism theorem is false for topological groups: if formula_50 is a morphism of topological groups (that is, a continuous homomorphism), it is not necessarily true that the induced homomorphism formula_51 is an isomorphism of topological groups; it will be a bijective, continuous homomorphism, but it will not necessarily be a homeomorphism. In other words, it will not necessarily admit an inverse in the category of topological groups. 

There is a version of the first isomorphism theorem for topological groups, which may be stated as follows: if formula_52 is a continuous homomorphism, then the induced homomorphism from to is an isomorphism if and only if the map is open onto its image.

The third isomorphism theorem, however, is true more or less verbatim for topological groups, as one may easily check.

== Hilbert&#x27;s fifth problem ==

There are several strong results on the relation between topological groups and Lie groups. 
First, every continuous homomorphism of Lie groups formula_53 is smooth. 
It follows that a topological group has a unique structure of a Lie group if one exists. 
Also, Cartan&#x27;s theorem says that every closed subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie subgroup, in particular a smooth submanifold.

Hilbert&#x27;s fifth problem asked whether a topological group that is a topological manifold must be a Lie group. 
In other words, does have the structure of a smooth manifold, making the group operations smooth? 
As shown by Andrew Gleason, Deane Montgomery, and Leo Zippin, the answer to this problem is yes. 
In fact, has a real analytic structure. 
Using the smooth structure, one can define the Lie algebra of , an object of linear algebra that determines a connected group up to covering spaces. 
As a result, the solution to Hilbert&#x27;s fifth problem reduces the classification of topological groups that are topological manifolds to an algebraic problem, albeit a complicated problem in general.

The theorem also has consequences for broader classes of topological groups. First, every compact group (understood to be Hausdorff) is an inverse limit of compact Lie groups. 
(One important case is an inverse limit of finite groups, called a profinite group. For example, the group of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers and the absolute Galois group of a field are profinite groups.) 
Furthermore, every connected locally compact group is an inverse limit of connected Lie groups. 
At the other extreme, a totally disconnected locally compact group always contains a compact open subgroup, which is necessarily a profinite group. 
(For example, the locally compact group contains the compact open subgroup , which is the inverse limit of the finite groups as &#x27; goes to infinity.)

== Representations of compact or locally compact groups ==

An action of a topological group on a topological space &quot;X&quot; is a group action of on &quot;X&quot; such that the corresponding function is continuous. 
Likewise, a representation of a topological group on a real or complex topological vector space &quot;V&quot; is a continuous action of on &quot;V&quot; such that for each , the map from &quot;V&quot; to itself is linear.

Group actions and representation theory are particularly well understood for compact groups, generalizing what happens for finite groups. 
For example, every finite-dimensional (real or complex) representation of a compact group is a direct sum of irreducible representations. 
An infinite-dimensional unitary representation of a compact group can be decomposed as a Hilbert-space direct sum of irreducible representations, which are all finite-dimensional; this is part of the Peter–Weyl theorem. 
For example, the theory of Fourier series describes the decomposition of the unitary representation of the circle group on the complex Hilbert space . 
The irreducible representations of are all 1-dimensional, of the form for integers (where is viewed as a subgroup of the multiplicative group *). 
Each of these representations occurs with multiplicity 1 in .

The irreducible representations of all compact connected Lie groups have been classified. 
In particular, the character of each irreducible representation is given by the Weyl character formula.

More generally, locally compact groups have a rich theory of harmonic analysis, because they admit a natural notion of measure and integral, given by the Haar measure. 
Every unitary representation of a locally compact group can be described as a direct integral of irreducible unitary representations. 
(The decomposition is essentially unique if is of Type I, which includes the most important examples such as abelian groups and semisimple Lie groups.) 
A basic example is the Fourier transform, which decomposes the action of the additive group formula_1 on the Hilbert space as a direct integral of the irreducible unitary representations of formula_1. 
The irreducible unitary representations of formula_1 are all 1-dimensional, of the form for .

The irreducible unitary representations of a locally compact group may be infinite-dimensional. 
A major goal of representation theory, related to the Langlands classification of admissible representations, is to find the unitary dual (the space of all irreducible unitary representations) for the semisimple Lie groups. 
The unitary dual is known in many cases such as , but not all.

For a locally compact abelian group , every irreducible unitary representation has dimension 1. 
In this case, the unitary dual formula_57 is a group, in fact another locally compact abelian group. 
Pontryagin duality states that for a locally compact abelian group , the dual of formula_57 is the original group . 
For example, the dual group of the integers is the circle group , while the group formula_1 of real numbers is isomorphic to its own dual.

Every locally compact group has a good supply of irreducible unitary representations; for example, enough representations to distinguish the points of (the Gelfand–Raikov theorem). 
By contrast, representation theory for topological groups that are not locally compact has so far been developed only in special situations, and it may not be reasonable to expect a general theory. 
For example, there are many abelian Banach–Lie groups for which every representation on Hilbert space is trivial.

== Homotopy theory of topological groups ==

Topological groups are special among all topological spaces, even in terms of their homotopy type. 
One basic point is that a topological group determines a path-connected topological space, the classifying space (which classifies principal -bundles over topological spaces, under mild hypotheses). 
The group is isomorphic in the homotopy category to the loop space of ; that implies various restrictions on the homotopy type of . 
Some of these restrictions hold in the broader context of H-spaces.

For example, the fundamental group of a topological group is abelian. 
(More generally, the Whitehead product on the homotopy groups of is zero.) 
Also, for any field &quot;k&quot;, the cohomology ring has the structure of a Hopf algebra. 
In view of structure theorems on Hopf algebras by Heinz Hopf and Armand Borel, this puts strong restrictions on the possible cohomology rings of topological groups. 
In particular, if is a path-connected topological group whose rational cohomology ring is finite-dimensional in each degree, then this ring must be a free graded-commutative algebra over formula_2, that is, the tensor product of a polynomial ring on generators of even degree with an exterior algebra on generators of odd degree.

In particular, for a connected Lie group , the rational cohomology ring of is an exterior algebra on generators of odd degree. 
Moreover, a connected Lie group has a maximal compact subgroup &quot;K&quot;, which is unique up to conjugation, and the inclusion of &quot;K&quot; into is a homotopy equivalence. 
So describing the homotopy types of Lie groups reduces to the case of compact Lie groups. 
For example, the maximal compact subgroup of is the circle group , and the homogeneous space can be identified with the hyperbolic plane. 
Since the hyperbolic plane is contractible, the inclusion of the circle group into is a homotopy equivalence.

Finally, compact connected Lie groups have been classified by Wilhelm Killing, Élie Cartan, and Hermann Weyl. 
As a result, there is an essentially complete description of the possible homotopy types of Lie groups. 
For example, a compact connected Lie group of dimension at most 3 is either a torus, the group SU(2) (diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere ), or its quotient group (diffeomorphic to ).

==Complete topological group==

Information about convergence of nets and filters, such as definitions and properties, can be found in the article about filters in topology.

===Canonical uniformity on a commutative topological group===

This article will henceforth assume that any topological group that we consider is an additive commutative topological group with identity element formula_61

The diagonal of formula_62 is the set
formula_63
and for any formula_64 containing formula_65 the canonical entourage or canonical vicinities around formula_66 is the set
formula_67

For a topological group formula_68 the canonical uniformity on formula_62 is the uniform structure induced by the set of all canonical entourages formula_70 as formula_66 ranges over all neighborhoods of formula_72 in formula_73

That is, it is the upward closure of the following prefilter on formula_74 
formula_75
where this prefilter forms what is known as a base of entourages of the canonical uniformity. 

For a commutative additive group formula_76 a fundamental system of entourages formula_77 is called a translation-invariant uniformity if for every formula_78 formula_79 if and only if formula_80 for all formula_81 A uniformity formula_77 is called translation-invariant if it has a base of entourages that is translation-invariant.

===Cauchy prefilters and nets===

The general theory of uniform spaces has its own definition of a &quot;Cauchy prefilter&quot; and &quot;Cauchy net.&quot; For the canonical uniformity on formula_76 these reduces down to the definition described below.

Suppose formula_84 is a net in formula_62 and formula_86 is a net in formula_87 Make formula_88 into a directed set by declaring formula_89 if and only if formula_90 Then formula_91 denotes the product net. If formula_92 then the image of this net under the addition map formula_93 denotes the sum of these two nets:
formula_94
and similarly their difference is defined to be the image of the product net under the subtraction map:
formula_95

A net formula_84 in an additive topological group formula_62 is called a Cauchy net if
formula_98
or equivalently, if for every neighborhood formula_66 of formula_72 in formula_76 there exists some formula_102 such that 
formula_103 for all indices formula_104 

A Cauchy sequence is a Cauchy net that is a sequence.

If formula_105 is a subset of an additive group formula_62 and formula_66 is a set containing formula_65 thenformula_105 is said to be an formula_66-small set or small of order formula_66 if formula_112

A prefilter formula_77 on an additive topological group formula_62 called a Cauchy prefilter if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: 

and if formula_62 is commutative then also:

* It suffices to check any of the above condition for any given neighborhood basis of formula_72 in formula_73

Suppose formula_77 is a prefilter on a commutative topological group formula_62 and formula_120 Then formula_121 in formula_62 if and only if formula_123 and formula_77 is Cauchy.

===Complete commutative topological group===

Recall that for any formula_125 a prefilter formula_126 on formula_10 is necessarily a subset of formula_128; that is, formula_129

A subset formula_10 of a topological group formula_62 is called a complete subset if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: 
A subset formula_10 is called a sequentially complete subset if every Cauchy sequence in formula_10 (or equivalently, every elementary Cauchy filter/prefilter on formula_10) converges to at least one point of formula_135

* Importantly, convergence outside of formula_10 is allowed: If formula_62 is not Hausdorff and if every Cauchy prefilter on formula_10 converges to some point of formula_139 then formula_10 will be complete even if some or all Cauchy prefilters on formula_10 &quot;also&quot; converge to points(s) in the complement formula_142 In short, there is no requirement that these Cauchy prefilters on formula_10 converge &quot;only&quot; to points in formula_135 The same can be said of the convergence of Cauchy nets in formula_135 
** As a consequence, if a commutative topological group formula_62 is &quot;not&quot; Hausdorff, then every subset of the closure of formula_147 say formula_148 is complete (since it is clearly compact and every compact set is necessarily complete). So in particular, if formula_149 (for example, if formula_10 a is singleton set such as formula_151) then formula_10 would be complete even though &quot;every&quot; Cauchy net in formula_10 (and every Cauchy prefilter on formula_10), converges to &quot;every&quot; point in formula_155 (include those points in formula_155 that are not in formula_10). 
** This example also shows that complete subsets (indeed, even compact subsets) of a non-Hausdorff space may fail to be closed (for example, if formula_158 then formula_10 is closed if and only if formula_160).

A commutative topological group formula_62 is called a complete group if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:
A topological group is called sequentially complete if it is a sequentially complete subset of itself.

Neighborhood basis: Suppose formula_162 is a completion of a commutative topological group formula_62 with formula_164 and that formula_14 is a neighborhood base of the origin in formula_73 Then the family of sets 
formula_167
is a neighborhood basis at the origin in formula_168

Let formula_62 and formula_170 be topological groups, formula_171 and formula_172 be a map. Then formula_172 is uniformly continuous if for every neighborhood formula_22 of the origin in formula_76 there exists a neighborhood formula_176 of the origin in formula_170 such that for all formula_178 if formula_179 then formula_180

== Generalizations ==

Various generalizations of topological groups can be obtained by weakening the continuity conditions:
* A semitopological group is a group with a topology such that for each the two functions defined by and are continuous.
* A quasitopological group is a semitopological group in which the function mapping elements to their inverses is also continuous.
* A paratopological group is a group with a topology such that the group operation is continuous.

<text>United Press International (UPI) is an American international news agency whose newswires, photo, news film, and audio services provided news material to thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations for most of the 20th century until its eventual decline beginning in the early 1980s. At its peak, it had more than 6,000 media subscribers. Since the first of several sales and staff cutbacks in 1982, and the 1999 sale of its broadcast client list to its main U.S. rival, the Associated Press, UPI has concentrated on smaller information-market niches.

==History==

Formally named United Press Associations for incorporation and legal purposes but publicly known and identified as United Press or UP, the news agency was created by the 1907 uniting of three smaller news syndicates by the Midwest newspaper publisher E. W. Scripps. It was headed by Hugh Baillie (1890–1966) from 1935 to 1955. At the time of his retirement, UP had 2,900 clients in the United States, and 1,500 abroad.

In 1958, it became United Press International after absorbing the International News Service (INS) As either UP or UPI, the agency was among the largest newswire services in the world, competing domestically for about 90 years with the Associated Press (AP) and internationally with AP, Reuters and Agence France-Presse (AFP).

At its peak, UPI had more than 2,000 full-time employees and 200 news bureaus in 92 countries; it had more than 6,000 media subscribers. With the rising popularity of television news, the business of UPI began to decline as the circulation of afternoon newspapers, its chief client category, began to fall. Its decline accelerated after the 1982 sale of UPI by the Scripps company.

The E.W. Scripps Company controlled United Press until its absorption of William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s smaller competing agency, INS, in 1958 to form UPI. With the Hearst Corporation as a minority partner, UPI continued under Scripps management until 1982.

Since its sale in 1982, UPI has changed ownership several times and was twice in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. With each change in ownership came deeper service and staff cutbacks and changes of focus and a corresponding shrinkage of its traditional media customer base. Since the 1999 sale of its broadcast client list to its one-time major rival, the AP, UPI has concentrated on smaller information market niches. It no longer services media organizations in a major way.

In 2000, UPI was purchased by News World Communications, an international news media company founded in 1976 by Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon.

It now maintains a news website and photo service and electronically publishes several information product packages. Based mostly on aggregation from other sources on the Web and gathered by a small editorial staff and stringers, UPI&#x27;s daily content consists of a newsbrief summary service called &quot;NewsTrack,&quot; which includes general, business, sports, science, health and entertainment reports, and &quot;Quirks in the News.&quot; It also sells a premium service, which has deeper coverage and analysis of emerging threats, the security industry, and energy resources. UPI&#x27;s content is presented in text, video and photo formats, in English, Spanish, and Arabic.

UPI&#x27;s main office is in the Miami metropolitan area and it maintains office locations in five other countries and uses freelance journalists in other major cities.

===British United Press===
In 1923, UP founded British United Press as its Canadian subsidiary with headquarters in Montreal. It soon expanded to the United Kingdom and India, and was one of several news agencies supplying news bulletins to the BBC until the broadcaster began hiring its own reporters. The BBC&#x27;s decision in 1936 to use BUP as a supplier of international news reports engendered opposition from other news agencies and the Foreign Office as BUP was seen as a front group for the American-based United Press and thus represented American rather than British news values. BUP correspondents included future anchors Knowlton Nash and Walter Cronkite. In 1936, BUP launched Canada&#x27;s first coast-to-coast radio newswire service providing news copy to private radio stations across the country. 

In 1940, the Canadian government suspended the broadcast licenses of BUP and Transradio Press Service both of whom, unlike Canadian Press, sold commercial sponsorships for its news bulletins in violation of government policy. Transport minister C.D. Howe, who was responsible for broadcasting policy, announced that the two wire services must “show their news source is accurate” in order to retain their licenses. After complaints by Transradio that the move was an attempt by “selfish publishing and monopolistic interests … to destroy independent news services throughout the Dominion”, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which at the time was also responsible for regulating private radio broadcasters, agreed to reinstate Transradio&#x27;s and BUP&#x27;s licenses while also announcing a plan to enforce the ban on commercial news broadcasts by editing dispatches by the wire services before they were distributed to radio stations. 

In 1958, when United Press merged with the International News Service to become UPI, British United Press was renamed United Press International of Canada. In 1979, 80% of UPI Canada was sold to the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; newspaper chain and renamed United Press Canada. In 1985, UPC was sold to Canadian Press, which absorbed it.

===United Press Associations===

Beginning with the &quot;Cleveland Press&quot;, publisher E. W. Scripps (1854–1926) created the first chain of newspapers in the United States. Because the then-recently reorganized Associated Press refused to sell its services to several of his papers, most of them evening dailies in competition with existing AP franchise holders, in 1907 Scripps merged three smaller syndicates under his ownership or control, the Publishers Press Association, the Scripps-McRae Press Association, and the Scripps News Association, to form United Press Associations, with headquarters in New York City.

Scripps had been a subscriber to an earlier news agency, also named United Press, that existed in the late 1800s, partly in cooperation with the management of the original New York-based AP and partly in existential competition with two Chicago-based organizations also using the AP name (as detailed at Associated Press and in AP&#x27;s 2007 history, &quot;Breaking News: How the Associated Press Has Covered War, Peace, and Everything Else&quot;, cited in Notes).

Drawing lessons from the battles between the earlier United Press and the various AP&#x27;s, Scripps required that there be no restrictions on who could buy news from his news service, and he made the new UP service available to anyone, including his competitors. Scripps also hoped to make a profit from selling that news to papers owned by others. At that time and until World War II, most newspapers relied on news agencies for stories outside their immediate geographic areas.

Despite strong newspaper industry opposition, UP started to sell news to the new and competitive radio medium in 1935, years before competitor AP, controlled by the newspaper industry, did likewise.

Scripps&#x27; United Press was considered &quot;a scrappy alternative&quot; news source to the AP. UP reporters were called &quot;Unipressers&quot; and were noted for their fiercely aggressive and competitive streak. Another hallmark of the company&#x27;s culture was little formal training of reporters; new hires were often thrust into a &quot;sink-or-swim&quot; situation of reporting on an unfamiliar subject. They were weaned on UP&#x27;s famous and well-documented (though frequently misappropriated and misquoted) slogan of &quot;Get it first, but FIRST, get it RIGHT.&quot; Despite controversy, UP (and later UPI) became a common training ground for generations of journalists.

Walter Cronkite, who started with United Press in Kansas City, gained fame for his coverage of World War II in Europe and turned down Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s first offer of a CBS job to stay with UP, but who later went on to anchor the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, once said, &quot;I felt every Unipresser got up in the morning saying, &#x27;This is the day I&#x27;m going to beat the hell out of AP.&#x27; That was part of the spirit. We knew we were undermanned. But we knew we could do a darn good job despite that, and so many times, we did.&quot;
Despite that, like all agencies that deal with huge volumes of timely information, UP and later UPI had its share of remembered mistakes. As recounted in the various printed histories of UPI cited in Notes, the most famous one came early in its history. UP&#x27;s president, Roy W. Howard, then traveling in France, telegraphed that the 1918 armistice ending World War I had been declared four days before it happened. Howard&#x27;s reputation survived and he later became a Scripps partner, whose name appeared in one of the Scripps subsidiary companies, Scripps-Howard. But the mistake dogged UP/UPI for generations. Still, the agency&#x27;s reporters were often able to tell stories more quickly and accurately although they were usually outnumbered by the competition. In 1950, for example, UP reported the invasion of South Korea by North Korea two hours and forty minutes before its archrival, the AP. &quot;The New York Times&quot; later apologized to UP for refusing to print information on the invasion until the AP had confirmed it.

===United Press International===
Frank Bartholomew, the last UP president to ascend to the agency&#x27;s top job directly from its news, rather than sales ranks, took over in 1955, and according to his memoirs cited in Notes, was obsessed with merging UP with the International News Service, a news agency that had been founded by William Randolph Hearst in 1909 following Scripps&#x27; lead.

Bartholomew succeeded in putting the &quot;I&quot; in UPI in 1958 when UP and INS merged to become United Press International The new UPI now had 6,000 employees and 5,000 subscribers, about a thousand of them newspapers.

The merger was aimed at creating a stronger competitor for the Associated Press and a stronger economic entity than either UP or INS. The newly formed United Press International (UPI) had 950 client newspapers. Fearing possible antitrust issues with the Eisenhower Administration Justice Department, Scripps and Hearst rushed the merger through with unusual speed and secrecy.

Although all UP employees were retained, most INS employees lost their jobs with practically no warning. A relative few did join the new UPI and the columns of popular INS writers, such as Bob Considine, Louella Parsons and Ruth Montgomery, were carried by UPI.

Rival AP was a publishers&#x27; cooperative and could assess its members to help pay the extraordinary costs of covering major news—wars, the Olympic Games, national political conventions. UPI clients, in contrast, paid a fixed annual rate; depending on individual contracts, UPI could not always ask them to help shoulder the extraordinary coverage costs. In its heyday, newspapers typically paid UPI about half what they paid AP in the same cities for the same services: At one point, for example, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; paid AP $12,500 a week, but UPI only $5,000; the Wall Street Journal paid AP $36,000 a week, but UPI only $19,300. The AP, which serviced 1,243 newspapers at the time, remained UPI&#x27;s main competitor. In 1959, UPI had 6,208 clients in 92 countries and territories, 234 news and picture bureaus, and an annual payroll of $34,000,000, ($ in today&#x27;s dollars).

But the UP-INS merger involved another business component that was to hurt the new UPI company badly in later years. Because INS had been a subsidiary of Hearst&#x27;s King Features Syndicate and Scripps controlled several other newspaper syndicates, both companies feared possible antitrust issues. So they deliberately kept their respective syndicates out of the combined UPI company. That move cost UPI the revenues of its previous United Feature Syndicate subsidiary, which in later years made large profits on the syndication of &quot;Peanuts&quot; and other popular comic strips and columns.

UPI had an advantage of independence over the AP in reporting on the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Because the AP was a cooperative essentially owned by the newspapers, those in the South influenced its coverage of the racial unrest and protests, often ignoring, minimizing, or slanting the reporting. UPI did not have that sort of pressure, and management, according to UPI reporters and photographers of the day, allowed them much freedom in chronicling the events of the civil rights struggle.

White House reporter Helen Thomas became the public face of UPI, as she was seen at televised press conferences beginning in the early 1960s. UPI famously scooped the AP in reporting the assassination of US President John Kennedy on Friday, November 22, 1963. UPI White House reporter Merriman Smith was an eyewitness, and he commandeered the press car&#x27;s only phone to dictate the story to UPI as AP reporter Jack Bell tried—without success—to wrest the phone away so he could call his office. Smith and UPI won a Pulitzer Prize for this reporting.

===UP/UPI Newspictures, Newsfilm and Audio/Radio Network===

United Press had no direct wirephoto service until 1952, when it absorbed co-owned ACME Newspictures, under pressure from parent company Scripps to better compete with AP&#x27;s news and photo services.

By that time, UP was also deeply involved with the newer visual medium of television. In 1948, it entered into a partnership with 20th Century Fox subsidiary Fox Movietone News to shoot newsfilm for television stations. That service, United Press Movietone, or UPMT, was a pioneer in newsfilm syndication and numbered among its clients major US and foreign networks and local stations, including for many years the early TV operation of ABC News. In subsequent decades, it underwent several changes in partnerships and names, becoming best known as United Press International Television News (UPITN). Senior UPITN executives later helped Ted Turner create CNN, with its first two presidents, Reese Schonfeld and Burt Reinhardt, coming from UPITN ranks.

The UPI Audio actuality service for radio stations, created in 1958 and later renamed the United Press International Radio Network, was a spinoff from the newsfilm service and eventually provided news material to more than a thousand radio stations and US and foreign networks, including NPR.

===Decline===
UPI came close to the size of the AP in the early 1960s, but as publishing companies began to pare their evening newspapers, it was dropped by papers that could no longer afford to subscribe to both UPI and the AP. UPI&#x27;s failure to develop a television presence or subsidiary television news service has also been cited as one of the causes of its decline. By the early 1980s, the number of staffers was down to 1,800 and there were just 100 news bureaus.

Under pressure from some of E. W. Scripps&#x27; heirs, the Scripps company, which had been underwriting UPI&#x27;s expenses at a loss for at least two decades, began trying to transfer control of UPI in the early 1980s. It tried to bring in additional newspaper industry partners and when that failed, engaged in serious negotiations with British competitor Reuters, which wanted to increase its US presence. As detailed in &quot;Down to the Wire&quot;, by Gordon and Cohen, cited in Notes, Reuters did extensive due diligence and expressed an interest in parts of the UPI service, but did not wish to maintain it in full.

Scripps wound up giving the agency away to two inexperienced businessmen, Douglas Ruhe (son of David Ruhe, a member of the Universal House of Justice, the supreme governing body of the Baháʼí Faith) and William Geissler, originally associated with two better-known partners, who soon departed. Ruhe and Geissler obtained UPI for $1. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Scripps first injected UPI with a $5 million cash balance, in acknowledgement of the $1.0 – $1.5 million per month that UPI was already losing. Facing news industry skepticism about their background and qualifications to run an international news agency, Ruhe and Geissler watched an increase in contract cancellations. Despite serious cash flow problems, they moved UPI&#x27;s headquarters from New York City to Washington, DC, incurring significant additional costs due to construction cost overruns.

During this period, UPI&#x27;s 25-year-old audio news actuality service for radio stations was renamed the United Press International Radio Network. But faced with recurring cash shortages and difficulty meeting payroll, the Ruhe-Geissler management sold UPI&#x27;s foreign photo service and some rights to its US and foreign photos to the Reuters news agency. In 1995, UPI&#x27;s U.S. photo library, which included the archives of predecessor Scripps photo agency Acme and the pictures and negatives of International News Photos, the picture component of Hearst&#x27;s INS, was sold to the Bettmann Archive.

Bettmann was sold to Microsoft founder Bill Gates&#x27;s separate Corbis Corporation, storing them underground in Pennsylvania and digitizing them for licensing, frequently without any notation of their UPI origins.

In August 2011, Corbis and AP agreed to distribute each other&#x27;s photos to their clients, effectively combining the pre-1983 UPI library with that of its former main rival for some marketing purposes.

In 2016, Corbis was sold to the Visual China Group.

UPI&#x27;s remaining minority stake in UPITN was also sold and the agency was renamed Worldwide Television News (WTN). As with its photographs, UPI thereby lost all control of its newsfilm and video library, which is now held by WTN-successor Associated Press Television News, which entered the video news field long after UPI left it.

Years of mismanagement, missed opportunities and continual wage and staff cuts followed. By 1984, UPI had descended into the first of two Chapter 11 Mario Vázquez Raña, a Mexican media magnate, with a nominal American minority partner, Houston real estate developer Joseph Russo, purchased UPI out of bankruptcy for $40 million, losing millions during his short tenure, and firing numerous high-level staff.

In 1988, Vázquez Raña sold UPI to Infotechnology, Inc., an information technology and venture capital company and parent company of cable TV&#x27;s Financial News Network, both headed by Earl Brian, who also became UPI chairman. In early 1991, Infotechnology itself filed for bankruptcy, announced layoffs at UPI and sought to terminate certain employee benefits in an attempt to keep UPI afloat. At that point, UPI was down to 585 employees. Later that year, UPI filed for bankruptcy for the second time, asking for relief from $50 million in debt so that it could be sale-able. In 1992, a group of Saudi investors, ARA Group International (AGI), bought the bankrupt UPI for $4 million.

By 1998, UPI had fewer than 250 employees and 12 offices. Although the Saudi-based investors claimed to have poured more than $120 million into UPI, it had failed to turn a profit. The company had begun to sell Internet-adapted products to such websites as Excite and Yahoo. At that point, UPI CEO Arnaud de Borchgrave orchestrated UPI&#x27;s exit from its last major media niche, the broadcast news business that United Press had initiated in the 1930s. De Borchgrave maintained that &quot;what was brilliant pioneering work on the part of UPI prior to World War II, with radio news, is now a static quantity and so far as I&#x27;m concerned, certainly doesn&#x27;t fit into my plans for the future&quot;. He sought to shift UPI&#x27;s dwindling resources into Internet-based delivery of newsletter services, focusing more on technical and diplomatic specialties than on general news. The rump UPI thus sold the client list of its still-significant radio network and broadcast wire to its former rival, the AP.

===Current ownership===
UPI was purchased in May 2000 by News World Communications, a media conglomerate founded by Unification Church founder Sun Myung Moon, which also owned &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and newspapers in South Korea, Japan, and South America. The next day, UPI&#x27;s White House correspondent, Helen Thomas, resigned her position, after working for UPI for 57 years.

In 2007, as part of a restructuring to keep UPI in business and profitable, management cut 11 staff from its Washington, D.C. office and no longer had a reporter in the White House press corps or a bureau covering the United Nations. UPI spokespersons and press releases said the company would be focusing instead on expanding operations in the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa, and reporting on security threats, intelligence and energy issues. In 2008, UPI began UPIU, a journalism mentoring platform for students and journalism schools, that allowed recent college graduates to post their work on the site but did not pay for stories.

<text>Pascal Lissouba (15 November 1931 – 24 August 2020) was a Congolese politician who was the first democratically elected President of the Republic of the Congo and served from 31 August 1992 until 25 October 1997. He was overthrown by his predecessor and current president Denis Sassou Nguesso in the 1997 civil war.

== Early life and education ==
Lissouba was born in Tsinguidi, south-west Congo, to Bandjabi parents. He attended primary school in Mossendjo and Boko. He began his secondary studies in Brazzaville and gained his education at the Lycée Félix Faure in Nice (1948–52), where he obtained a baccalaureate. He then studied Agronomy at the &quot;École Supérieure d&#x27;Agriculture&quot; in Tunis and secured a diploma in agricultural engineering in 1956. At the University of Paris (1958–61) he received a doctoral degree in biology. He was also a fellow trainee at the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) in Paris and at ORSTOM. In June 1961, he worked as a researcher at ORSTOM. He was appointed lecturer in plant biology by decree of the French Ministry of National Education on 3 November 1961.

== Political career ==
Initially he was a civil servant, working as a managing director in the Department of Agriculture (1962–63), having returned in 1962. But his abilities advanced him to become Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Water, and Forestry on 16 August 1963 until 1966 and then Prime Minister (1963–66) under President Alphonse Massamba-Débat. He was appointed Minister of State for Planning, then for Agriculture (1968–1969), before being sacked by the government. Afterwards, he became a genetics professor at the University of Brazzaville (1966–1971) and later director of the Ecole Supérieure des Sciences in 1970. When Massamba-Débat was overthrown in 1968 Lissouba remained in government under Marien Ngouabi and although he was suspended from political activity from 1969 to 1971 he was on the Central Committee of the Congolese Workers Party in 1973.

In 1977, he was implicated for involvement in the assassination of Ngouabi and was arrested. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and hard labour in 1977. He was released in 1979 but had to live in exile in France from 1979 to 1990. In France, he was a professor of genetics at the University of Paris and then worked for UNESCO in Paris and Nairobi. When President Denis Sassou Nguesso was forced to move the Congo towards democracy in 1991, Lissouba returned in February 1992 and was elected president in the August 1992 elections. He secured 36% of the vote as head of the left-wing Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (&quot;Union panafricaine pour la démocratie sociale&quot;, UPADS). In the run-off with second-placed Bernard Kolelas, Lissouba got 61% of the vote.

==Unrest and civil war ==
Conflict soon broke out however. A coalition of opposition groups and their militias accused Lissouba of rigging the elections. Widespread civil war was averted when Gabon and the Organisation of African Unity intervened, but sporadic fighting continued until January 1995.

Fighting broke out again in June 1997 when Lissouba engaged militias loyal to former President Col. Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Congolese Labor Party (PCT) in Brazzaville, accusing the former president of an attempted coup. Sassou Nguesso, however, was able to escape and stage a counterattack. Thus began a 4-month civil war that destroyed or damaged much of the capital. In early October 1997, Angolan troops invaded Congo on the side of Sassou. Most of Brazzaville fell to rebel and Angolan forces on 14 October 1997, and Lissouba fled; within two days the capital was under the control of forces loyal to Sassou Nguesso, and Pointe-Noire fell with little resistance. Sassou Nguesso proclaimed himself President on 25 October 1997, but militia forces loyal to Lissouba continued a guerrilla war. The vital Congo-Ocean Railway from the coastal city of Pointe-Noire was cut, and Brazzaville was heavily damaged before a cease-fire was agreed to in December 1999.

== Exile and trial ==
Following his overthrow, Lissouba lived in exile in London. He intended to return to the Congo for the 2002 elections, but in December 2001 he was tried &quot;in absentia&quot; in Brazzaville, and sentenced to 30 years forced labor for treason and corruption, related to a $150 million oil deal with the American company Occidental Petroleum. Since 2004, he had been living in Paris in exile.

== Personal life ==
He was first married to Annette Chantegreil (1933-2019), then to Jocelyne Rosdam, a French national and is the father of eleven children. His eldest daughter, Mireille Lissouba, was his chief of staff from 1993 to 1996, while his younger daughter, Danielle Bineka is a university professor and writer, both currently exiled in Canada. His mother, Marie Bouanga died in 1996.

== Death ==
Lissouba died in Perpignan, France, on 24 August 2020, due to complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, aged 88.

<text>Year 1286 ([[Roman numerals|MCCLXXXVI]]) was a common year starting on Tuesday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Europe ====
* January 6 – The 17-year-old Philip IV (the Fair) is crowned king of France at Reims. He settles the Aragonese conflict (see 1285), and intensifies his predecessors&#x27; efforts to reform and rationalize the administration of the realm. Philip persists in reforms, which strengthen the monarchy&#x27;s position in Europe. The gabelle – a tax on salt in the form of a state monopoly – will become immensely unpopular and grossly unequal, but persist until 1790.
* March 20 – Sultan Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd al-Haqq dies after a 28-year reign at Algeciras. He is succeeded by his son Abu Yaqub Yusuf an-Nasr, who becomes ruler of the Marinid Sultanate. Abu Yaqub makes a peace agreement with Muhammad II, Nasrid ruler of Granada, ceding all the towns previously occupied (except Algeciras and Tarifa). After confirming the peace with Castile on May 28, he leaves 3,000 men in the Peninsula.
* Old Prussians resettle in Samland and start an uprising against Teutonic rule (supported by the Principality of Rügen). The Prussians are defeated by the Teutonic Knights and forced to submit.
* The War of the Donkey is fought between the rival noble families of the Ghisi and the Sanudo, in the Duchy of the Archipelago in the Aegean Sea. 
* The Guelph Republic of Siena allows exiled Ghibelline rebels back into the city.

==== England &amp; Scotland ====
* March 19 – King Alexander III dies in a fall from his horse at Kinghorn in Fife, leaving Queen Yolande of Dreux&#x27;s unborn child and the 3-year-old Margaret (Maid of Norway) as heirs to the throne. After Alexander&#x27;s death, Scotland is governed by the nobility and clergy, known collectively as the Guardians of Scotland. This sets the stage for the First War of Scottish Independence.
* June – King Edward I (Longshanks) and Queen Eleanor of Castile travel to France. There they pay homage to Philip IV (the Fair) and attend to other matters. Edward travels around in the duchy of Gascony and orders the rebuilding of fortifications in the region (between 1286 and 1289).

==== Levant ====
* June 4 – The 15-year-old Henry II sails from Cyprus and lands in Acre, but is refused entry into the citadel. There, he stays for six weeks in the palace to negotiate an agreement to take over the city from the Angevins.
* August 15 – Henry II is crowned king of Jerusalem at Tyre. After the ceremony, he returns to Acre for the festivities. A few weeks later, Henry returns to Cyprus and appoints his uncle Philip of Ibelin as regent (&quot;bailiff&quot;).

==== Africa ====
* Abu Hafs Umar I, ruler of the Hafsid Sultanate, takes control of Béjaïa and becomes a rival of the main Hafsid entity based in Tunis.

==== Asia ====
* In the Lao kingdom of Muang Sua, King Panya Leng is overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état led by his son, Prince Panya Khamphong, which is likely to have been supported by the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty in China.
* Kublai Khan makes plans for a final Mongol invasion of Japan, but aborts the preparations due to a lack of necessary resources.

<text>Whole language is a philosophy of reading and a discredited educational method originally developed for teaching literacy in English to young children. The method became a major model for education in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK in the 1980s and 1990s, despite there being no scientific support for the method&#x27;s effectiveness. It is based on the premise that learning to read English comes naturally to humans, especially young children, in the same way that learning to speak develops naturally.

Whole-language approaches to reading instruction are typically contrasted with phonics-based methods of teaching reading and writing. Phonics-based methods emphasize instruction for decoding and spelling. Whole-language practitioners disagree with that view and instead focus on teaching meaning and making students read more. The scientific consensus is that whole-language-based methods of reading instruction (e.g., teaching children to use context cues to guess the meaning of a printed word) are not as effective as phonics-based approaches.

==Overview==
Whole language is an educational philosophy that is complex to describe, particularly because it is informed by multiple research fields, including but not limited to education, linguistics, psychology, sociology, and anthropology (see also Language Experience Approach). It can be viewed as being founded on the educational philosophy of John Amos Comenius in the early 17th century. Yetta Goodman has also cited the contributions of Dewey, Vygotsky, Rosenblatt, and Ashton Warner, among other writers, in the development of the whole language movement. One description of whole language is &quot;a concept that embodies both a philosophy of language development as well as the instructional approaches embedded within, and supportive of that philosophy&quot;.

Several strands run through descriptions of whole language. These include:
* focus on making meaning in reading and expressing meaning in writing;
* constructivist approaches to knowledge creation, emphasizing students&#x27; interpretations of texts and free expression of ideas in writing (often through daily journal entries);
* emphasis on high-quality and culturally diverse literature;
* integrating literacy into other areas of the curriculum, especially math, science, and social studies;
* frequent reading;
** with students in small guided reading groups
** to students with read-alouds
** by students independently;
* reading and writing for real purposes;
* focus on motivational aspects of literacy, emphasizing the love of books and engaging reading materials;
* meaning-centered whole– to part-to-whole instruction where phonics are taught contextually in embedded phonics (different from synthetic phonics or analytical phonics);
* emphasis on using and understanding the meaning-making role of phonics, grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation in diverse social contexts.

Attempts to empirically verify the benefits of whole language have repeatedly resulted in evidence that whole language is less effective than phonics-based reading instruction. Research psychologist Keith Stanovich has asserted, &quot;The idea that learning to read is just like learning to speak is accepted by no responsible linguist, psychologist, or cognitive scientist in the research community&quot;, while in a systematic review of the reading research literature, Louisa Moats, a researcher on children&#x27;s education, concluded that &quot;Almost every premise advanced by whole language about how reading is learned has been contradicted by scientific investigations&quot;. Harvard professor Jeanne Chall surveyed the research on literacy and conducted her own classroom observations and found that the &quot;code-emphasis method&quot; (phonics) produces substantially better readers, not only in the mechanical aspects of reading but also in terms of reading for meaning and reading for enjoyment, contrary to the claims of whole-language theorists.

==Underlying premises==
===Cognitive skills of reading===
Sub-lexical reading

Sub-lexical reading involves teaching reading by associating characters or groups of characters with sounds or by using phonics learning and teaching methodology.

Lexical reading

Lexical reading involves acquiring words or phrases without attention to the characters or groups of characters that compose them or by using whole language learning and teaching methodology.

===Learning theory===
According to some, the idea of whole language has its basis in holism, the belief that a system should be viewed as a whole, not merely as a collection of parts. Simply put, this is &quot;the theoretical basis for the term whole language&quot;.

An important element for most teachers is also the principle that education and learning are driven by engagement, and engagement with reading is triggered through quality content. This dates back to the theories of John Amos Comenius, who first pushed for education to move away from dull rote learning. This also reflects a fundamental element of the concern voiced by many educators over the use of pure phonics and the positivist view that you can accurately measure the development of reading sub-skills.

===Ken Goodman&#x27;s linguistic theory===
Gregory Shafer, a professor of English at Mott Community College, has claimed that &quot;the seeds&quot; of the whole language movement were &quot;firmly rooted&quot; in the theories of linguist Noam Chomsky. In 1967, Ken Goodman had an idea about reading that he considered similar to Chomsky&#x27;s, and he wrote a widely cited article called &quot;Reading: A psycholinguistic guessing game&quot;. Goodman set out to determine whether the views of Chomsky could serve as psychological models of the reading process. He chided educators for attempting to apply what he saw as unnecessary orthographic order to a process that relied on holistic examination of words. Whether Goodman was indeed inspired by Chomsky, neither Chomsky himself nor his followers have ever accepted Goodman&#x27;s views.

Goodman thought that there are four &quot;cueing systems&quot; for reading, four things that readers have to guess what word comes next:
# graphophonemic: the shapes of the letters and the sounds that they evoke (see phonetics).
# semantic: what word one would expect to occur based on the meaning of the sentence so far (see semantics).
# syntactic: what part of speech or word would make sense based on the grammar of the language (see syntax).
# pragmatic: what is the function of the text

The &quot;graph&quot; part of the word &quot;graphophonemic&quot; means the shape or symbol of the graphic input, i.e., the text. According to Goodman, these systems work together to help readers guess the right word. He emphasized that pronouncing individual words will involve the use of all three systems (letter clues, meaning clues from context, and syntactical structure of the sentence).

The graphophonemic cues are related to the sounds we hear (the phonological system including individual letters and letter combinations), the letters of the alphabet, and the conventions of spelling, punctuation, and print. Students who are emerging readers use these cues considerably. However, in the English language, there is a very imprecise relationship between written symbols and sound symbols. Sometimes the relationships and their patterns do not work, as in the example of &quot;great&quot; and &quot;head&quot;. Proficient readers and writers draw on their prior experiences with text and the other cueing systems, as well as the phonological system, as their reading and writing develops. Ken Goodman writes that, &quot;The cue systems are used simultaneously and interdependently. What constitutes useful graphic information depends on how much syntactic and semantic information is available. Within high contextual constraints an initial consonant may be all that is needed to identify an element and make possible the prediction of an ensuing sequence or the confirmation of prior predictions.&quot; He continues with, &quot;Reading requires not so much skills as strategies that make it possible to select the most productive cues.&quot; He believes that reading involves the interrelationship of all the language systems. Readers sample and make judgments about which cues from each system will provide the most useful information in making predictions that will get them to meaning. Goodman provides a partial list of the various systems readers use as they interact with text. Within the graphophonemic system there are:
* Letter–sound relationships
* Shape (or word configuration)
* Know &#x27;little words&#x27; in bigger words
* Whole know words
* Recurrent spelling patterns

The semantic cuing system is the one in which meaning is constructed. &quot;So focused is reading on making sense that the visual input, the perceptions we form, and the syntactic patterns we assign are all directed by our meaning construction.&quot; The key component of the semantic system is context. A reader must be able to attach meaning to words and have some prior knowledge to use as a context for understanding the word. They must be able to relate the newly learned word to prior knowledge through personal associations with text and the structure of text.

The semantic system is developed from the beginning through early interactions with adults. At first, this usually involves labeling (e.g., &quot;This is a dog&quot;). Then labeling becomes more detailed (e.g., &quot;It is a Labrador dog. Its coat is black.&quot;) The child learns that there is a set of &quot;dog attributes&quot; and that within the category &quot;dog&quot;, there are subsets of &quot;dog&quot; (e.g., long-hair, short-hair). The development of this system and the development of the important concepts that relate to the system are largely accomplished as children begin to explore language independently. As children speak about what they&#x27;ve done and play out their experiences, they are making personal associations between their experiences and language. This is critical to success in later literacy practices, such as reading comprehension and writing. The meaning people bring to the reading is available to them through every cuing system, but it&#x27;s particularly influential as we move from our sense of the syntactic patterns to the semantic structures.

The syntactic system, according to Goodman and Watson, includes the interrelation of words and sentences within connected text. In the English language, syntactic relations include word order, tense, number, and gender. The syntactic system is also concerned with word parts that change the meaning of a word, called morphemes. For example, adding the suffix &quot;less&quot; or adding &quot;s&quot; to the end of a word changes its meaning or tense. As speakers of English, people know where to place subjects, which pronoun to use, and where adjectives occur. Individual word meaning is determined by the place of the word in the sentence and the particular semantic or syntactic role it occupies.
For example:

&quot;T&quot;he mayor was present when he received a beautiful present from the present members of the board&quot;.&quot;

The syntactic system is usually in place when children begin school. Immersed in language, children begin to recognize that phrases and sentences are usually ordered in certain ways. This notion of ordering is the development of syntax. Like all the cuing systems, syntax provides the possibility of correct prediction when trying to make sense or meaning of written language. Goodman notes the cues found in the flow of language are:
* Patterns of words (or function order)
* Inflection and inflectional agreement
* Function words such as noun markers (the, a, that)
* Intonation (which is poorly represented in writing by punctuation)

The pragmatic system is also involved in the construction of meaning while reading. This brings into play the socio-cultural knowledge of the reader. It provides information about the purposes and needs the reader has while reading. Yetta Goodman and Dorothy Watson state that, &quot;Language has different meaning depending on the reason for use, the circumstances in which the language is used, and the ideas writers and readers have about the contextual relations with the language users. Language cannot exist outside a sociocultural context, which includes the prior knowledge of the language user. For example, shopping lists, menus, reports and plays are arranged uniquely and are dependent on the message, the intent, the audience, and the context.&quot;

By the time children begin school, they may have developed an inferred understanding of some of the pragmatics of a particular situation. For example, turn-taking in conversation, reading poetry, or a shopping list. &quot;While different materials may share common semantic, syntactic, and graphophonic features, each genre has its own organization and each requires certain experiences by the reader.&quot;

Goodman performed a study where children first read words individually and then read the same words in connected text. He found that the children did better when they read the words in connected text. Later replications of the experiment failed to find effects, however, when children did not read the same words in connected text immediately after reading them individually, as they had in Goodman&#x27;s experiment.

Goodman&#x27;s theory has been criticized by other researchers who favor a phonics-based approach, and present research to support their viewpoint. Critics argue that good readers use decoding as their primary approach to reading, and use context to confirm that what they have read makes sense.

===Application of Goodman&#x27;s theory===
Goodman&#x27;s argument was compelling to educators as a way of thinking about beginning reading and literacy more broadly. This led to the idea that reading and writing were concepts that should be considered as wholes, learned by experience and exposure more than analysis and didactic instruction. This largely accounts for the focus on time spent reading, especially independent reading. Many classrooms (whole-language or otherwise) include silent reading time, sometimes called DEAR (&quot;Drop Everything And Read&quot;) time or SSR (sustained silent reading). Some versions of this independent reading time include a structured role for the teacher, especially Reader&#x27;s Workshop. Despite the popularity of the extension of Chomsky&#x27;s linguistic ideas to literacy, it is based on a misunderstanding of those theories as, unlike language, literacy is not a human universal but a human invention (much as children learn to walk without being taught, but not how to drive a car or fly a helicopter). All experimental research shows that reading, unlike language in the Chomskyan view, is not a pre-programmed human skill; it must be learned. Sally Shaywitz, a neurologist at Yale University, is credited with much of the research on the neurological structures of reading.

===Contrasts with phonics===
Because of this holistic emphasis, whole language is contrasted with skill-based areas of instruction, especially phonics and synthetic phonics. Phonics instruction is a commonly used technique for teaching students to read. It tends to emphasize attention to the individual components of words, for example, the sounds (phonemes) /k/, /æ/, and /t/ are represented by the letters (graphemes) &quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;t&quot;. Because whole language proponents do not focus exclusively on the individual parts, tending to focus on the relationship of parts to and within the larger context, they do not favor some types of phonics instruction. Whole language advocates state that they do teach and believe in phonics, especially a type of phonics known as embedded phonics. In embedded phonics, letters are taught during other lessons focused on meaning and the phonics component is considered a &quot;mini lesson&quot;. Instruction in embedded phonics typically emphasizes the consonants and the short vowels, as well as letter combinations called rimes or phonograms. The use of this embedded phonics model is called a &quot;whole-part-whole&quot; approach because, consistent with holistic thinking, students read the text for meaning first (whole), then examine features of the phonics system (part), and finally use their new knowledge while reading the text again (whole). 

This mixed approach is a development from the practice employed in the 1970s and 1980s, when virtually no phonics was included in the curriculum at all. Theorists such as Ken Goodman and Frank Smith at that time advocated a &quot;guessing game&quot; approach, entirely based on context and whole-word analysis. It is worth noting that neuroscientist Mark Seidenberg, one of the many critics of whole language and Balance Literacy, writes that Ken Goodman&#x27;s &quot;guessing game theory&quot; had no supporting evidence and &quot;was grievously wrong&quot;. In addition, in his 2009 book, &quot;Reading in the brain&quot;, cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene said, &quot;cognitive psychology directly refutes any notion of teaching via a &#x27;global&#x27; or &#x27;whole language&#x27; method.&quot; He goes on to talk about &quot;the myth of whole-word reading&quot;, saying it has been refuted by recent experiments. &quot;We do not recognize a printed word through a holistic grasping of its contours, because our brain breaks it down into letters and graphemes.&quot;

Most whole language advocates now see that children go through stages of spelling development as they develop, use, and gain control over written language. Early literacy research conducted by Piagetian researcher Emilia Ferreiro, published in her book &quot;Literacy Before Schooling&quot;, has been replicated by University of Alabama professor Maryann Manning. Based on this research, &quot;invented spelling&quot; is another &quot;whole-part-whole&quot; approach: children learn to read by writing in a meaningful context, e.g., by writing letters to others. To write a word, they have to decompose its spoken form into sounds and then translate them into letters, e.g., &quot;k&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;t&quot; for the phonemes /k/, /æ/, and /t/. Empirical studies show that later spelling development is fostered rather than hindered by these invented spellings—as long as children from the beginning are confronted with &quot;book spellings&quot;, too.

===Rise of whole language and reaction===
After its introduction by Goodman, whole language rose in popularity dramatically. It became a major educational paradigm of the late 1980s and the 1990s. Despite its popularity during this period, educators who believed that skill instruction was important for students&#x27; learning, and some researchers in education, were skeptical of whole-language claims. What followed were the &quot;Reading Wars&quot; of the 1980s and 1990s between advocates of phonics and those of whole-language methodology, which in turn led to several attempts to catalog research on the efficacy of phonics and whole language.

New Zealand education researcher Marie Clay created the Reading Recovery program in 1976. After lengthy observations of early readers, Clay defined reading as a message-getting, problem-solving activity, and writing as a message-sending, problem-solving activity. Clay suggested that both activities involved linking invisible patterns of oral language with visible symbols.

The US Congress commissioned reading expert Marilyn Jager Adams to write a definitive book on the topic. She determined that phonics was important but suggested that some elements of the whole language approach were helpful. Two large-scale efforts, in 1998 by the United States National Research Council&#x27;s Commission on Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children and in 2000 by the United States National Reading Panel, catalogued the most important elements of a reading program. While proponents of whole language find the latter to be controversial, both panels found that phonics instruction of varying kinds, especially analytic and synthetic phonics, contributed positively to students&#x27; ability to read words on tests of reading words in isolation. Both panels also found that embedded phonics and no phonics contributed to lower rates of achievement for most populations of students when measured on tests of reading words in isolation. The panel recommended an approach it described as &quot;scientifically based reading research&quot; (SBRR), which cited five elements essential to effective reading instruction: explicit Systematic Phonics instruction, phonological awareness, reading comprehension, vocabulary, and fluency.

Stephen Krashen criticized the evidence presented in the National Reading Panel&#x27;s Report in 2004 as well as clarifying the role of reading in acquiring phonics and the use of explicit phonics instruction at the beginner level in whole language.

In December 2005, the Australian government endorsed the teaching of synthetic phonics and discredited the whole language approach (&quot;on its own&quot;). Its Department of Education, Science and Training published a National Inquiry into the Teaching of Literacy. The report states: &quot;The evidence is clear, whether from research, good practice observed in schools, advice from submissions to the Inquiry, consultations, or from Committee members&#x27; own individual experiences, that direct systematic instruction in phonics during the early years of schooling is an essential foundation for teaching children to read.&quot; See .

In 2006, the U.K. Department for Education and Skills undertook a review of early reading that came out in favor of Synthetic phonics. Subsequently, in March 2011, the U.K. Department of Education released a white paper entitled &quot;The Importance of Teaching&quot;, which supported systematic synthetic phonics as the best method for teaching reading.

On 23 April 2022, the Center for Research in Education and Social Policy at the University of Delaware presented the results of a study of Marie Clay&#x27;s Reading Recovery long-term effects, finding that the &quot;long-term impact estimates were significant and negative&quot;.

===State of the debate===
Despite these results, many whole language advocates continue to argue that their approach, including embedded phonics, has been shown to improve student achievement. Whole language advocates sometimes criticize advocates of skill instruction as reductionist and describe the use of phonics as &quot;word calling&quot;, because it does not involve the use of meaning. The United States National Reading Panel is criticized especially harshly by some in the whole-language community for failing to include qualitative research designs that show benefits for embedded phonics (the panel only considered experiments and quasi-experiments). On the other hand, some parents and teachers have objected to the de-emphasis of phonics in whole-language based curricula (such as Reading Recovery) and have advocated for the removal of whole language from schools.

In 1996, the California Department of Education led the way in returning to the teaching of phonics. By 2014, the department had clear guidelines for teaching children in phonemic awareness, phonics, and segmenting and blending. The New York Public School System followed, and by 2015 had abandoned whole language, Embedded Phonics, and Balanced Literacy in favor of systematic phonics.

Neuroscientists have also weighed into the debate, some of them demonstrating that the whole-word method is much slower and uses the wrong brain area for reading. One neuroscientist, Mark Seidenberg, says &quot;Goodman&#x27;s guessing game theory was grievously wrong&quot; and &quot;the impact was enormous and continues to be felt&quot;. When it come to evidence supporting the whole-language theory, he emphatically states &quot;There wasn&#x27;t any&quot;. He is also especially critical of Smith&#x27;s book, &quot;Reading Without Nonsense&quot;, which suggests the following recommendation to help a struggling reader: &quot;The first alternative and preference is to skip over the puzzling word. The second alternative is to guess what the unknown word might be. And the final and least preferred alternative is to sound the word out. Phonics, in other words, comes last.&quot; Seidenberg goes on to say that, although reading science has rejected the theories behind whole language, in education they are &quot;theoretical zombies&quot;. Cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene has said, &quot;cognitive psychology directly refutes any notion of teaching via a &#x27;global&#x27; or &#x27;whole language&#x27; method.&quot; He goes on to talk about &quot;the myth of whole-word reading&quot; (also: sight words), saying it has been refuted by recent experiments. &quot;We do not recognize a printed word through a holistic grasping of its contours, because our brain breaks it down into letters and graphemes.&quot;

====One district&#x27;s experience: Bethlehem PA====
In 2015, Jack Silva, the chief academic officer for Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, discovered that a lot of students in his district were struggling with reading. In 2015, only 56 percent of third-graders were scoring proficient on the state reading test. Silvia conducted a survey of reading instruction methods that were being used. The predominant approach, he learned, involved the use of methods based upon a whole-language philosophy. In response, the Bethlehem district invested approximately $3 million on training, materials, and support to help its early elementary teachers and principals learn the science of how reading works and how children should be taught, focusing on phonics instruction. At the end of the 2018 school year, after the phonics-based re-training, 84 percent of kindergartners met or exceeded the benchmark score.

====Adoption of some whole-language concepts====
While rancor continues, much of whole language&#x27;s emphasis on quality literature, cultural diversity, and reading in groups and to students is widely supported by the educational community due to its benefits of increased comprehension. The importance of motivation, long a central focus of whole-language approaches, has gained more attention in the broader educational community in the last few years. Prominent critic of whole language Louisa Cook Moats has argued, however, that the focus on quality literature, diversity, reading groups, and motivation are not the sole property of whole language. She and others contend that these components of instruction are supported by educators of diverse educational perspectives. As one report states, &quot;Reading materials must be carefully chosen so as to be at the right reading level. Phonics instruction cannot stand alone&quot;. Moats contends that the principles essential to whole language, and those that render it ineffective and unfit for reading education are: a) children learn to read from exposure to print, b) hostility to drilling in phonics and other forms of direct instruction, and c) the tendency to endorse the use of context-clues and guesswork to decipher a word rather than phonemic decoding.

====Balanced literacy====
Since 1996, &quot;balanced literacy&quot; has been suggested as an integrative approach, portrayed by its advocates as taking the best elements of both whole language and code-emphasizing phonics, something promoted by Adams in 1990. In 1996, the California Department of Education described the balanced approach as &quot;one which combines the language and literature-rich activities associated with whole language with explicit teaching of the skills needed to decode words—for all children.&quot; In 1997, the department called for grade-one teaching of concepts about print, phonemic awareness, decoding, and word recognition, as well as vocabulary and concept development. In 2014, the department stated, &quot;Ensuring that children know how to decode regularly spelled one-syllable words by mid-first grade is crucial&quot;. It went on to say that &quot;Learners need to be phonemically aware (especially able to segment and blend phonemes)&quot;. In grades two and three, children receive explicit instruction in advanced phonic-analysis and reading multi-syllabic and more complex words.

The New York Public School system adopted balanced literacy as its literacy curriculum in 2003. However, in 2015, it began a process of revising its English Language Arts Learning Standards, calling for teaching involving &quot;reading or literacy experiences&quot; as well as phonemic awareness from pre-kindergarten to grade 1, and phonics and word recognition from grade 1 to grade 4.

Other states, such as Ohio, Colorado, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Arkansas are continuing to emphasize the need for instruction in evidenced-based phonics.

Critics of balanced literacy have suggested that the term is a disingenuous recasting of whole language with obfuscating new terminology. Neuroscientist Mark Seidenberg, a proponent of the science of reading and the teaching of phonics, writes that, &quot;Balanced literacy allowed educators to declare an end to the increasingly troublesome &#x27;wars&#x27; without resolving the underlying issues&quot;, and that &quot;Balanced literacy provided little guidance for teachers who thought that phonics was a cause of poor reading and did not know how to teach it&quot;.

No Child Left Behind has brought a resurgence of interest in phonics. Its &quot;Reading First&quot; program addresses the reading deficiency in elementary students and requires that students must be explicitly and systematically taught five skills: phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, comprehension, and fluency. During the 2000s, whole language receded to marginal status, and continues to fade.

==Proponents and critics==
Prominent proponents of whole language include Ken Goodman, Frank Smith, Carolyn Burke, Jerome Harste, Yetta Goodman, Dorothy Watson, and Stephen Krashen.

Widely known whole-language critics include Rudolf Flesch, Louisa Cook Moats, G. Reid Lyon, James M. Kauffman, Phillip Gough (co-creator of the Simple view of reading), Keith Stanovich, Diane McGuinness, Steven Pinker, David C. Geary, Douglas Carnine, Edward Kame&#x27;enui, Jerry Silbert, Lynn Melby Gordon, Diane Ravitch, Jeanne Chall, Emily Hanford, Jordan Peterson, Mark Seidenberg, and Stanislas Dehaene.

<text>Phonics is a method for teaching reading and writing to beginners. To use phonics is to teach the relationship between the sounds of the spoken language (phonemes), and the letters (graphemes) or groups of letters or syllables of the written language. Phonics is also known as the alphabetic principle or the &quot;alphabetic code&quot;. It can be used with any writing system that is alphabetic, such as that of English, Russian, and most other languages. Phonics is also sometimes used as part of the process of teaching Chinese people (and foreign students) to read and write Chinese characters, which are not alphabetic, using pinyin, which is alphabetic.

While the principles of phonics generally apply regardless of the language or region, the examples in this article are from General American English pronunciation. For more about phonics as it applies to British English, see Synthetic phonics, a method by which the student learns the sounds represented by letters and letter combinations, and blends these sounds to pronounce words.

Phonics is taught using a variety of approaches, for example:

* learning &quot;individual&quot; sounds and their corresponding letters (e.g., the word cat has three letters and three sounds c - a - t, (in IPA: , , ), whereas the word flower has six letters but four sounds: f - l - ow - er, (IPA , , , ), or
* learning the sounds of letters or groups of letters, at the word level, such as similar sounds (e.g., cat, can, call), or rimes (e.g., hat, mat and sat have the same rime, &quot;at&quot;), or consonant blends (also consonant clusters in linguistics) (e.g., bl as in black and st as in last), or syllables (e.g., pen-cil and al-pha-bet), or
* having students read books, play games and perform activities that contain the sounds they are learning.

==Overview==

Reading by using phonics is often referred to as &quot;decoding words&quot;, &quot;sounding-out words&quot; or using &quot;print-to-sound relationships&quot;. Since phonics focuses on the sounds and letters within words (i.e. sublexical), it is often contrasted with whole language (a word-level-up philosophy for teaching reading) and a compromise approach called balanced literacy (the attempt to combine whole language and phonics).

Some phonics critics suggest that learning phonics prevents children from reading &quot;real books&quot;. However, the Department for Education in England says children should practise phonics by reading books consistent with their developing phonic knowledge and skill; and, at the same time they should hear, share and discuss &quot;a wide range of high-quality books to develop a love of reading and broaden their vocabulary&quot;. In addition, researchers say that &quot;the phonological pathway is an essential component of skilled reading&quot; and &quot;for most children it requires instruction, hence phonics&quot;. Some recommend 20–30 minutes of daily phonics instruction in grades K–2, about 200 hours.

The National Reading Panel in the United States concluded that systematic phonics instruction is more effective than unsystematic phonics or non-phonics instruction. Some critics suggest that systematic phonics is &quot;skill and drill&quot; with little attention to meaning. However, researchers point out that this impression is false. Teachers can use engaging games or materials to teach letter-sound connections, and it can also be incorporated with the reading of meaningful text.

===History===
The term &quot;phonics&quot; during the 19th century and into the 1970s was used as a synonym of phonetics. The use of the term in reference to the method of teaching is dated to 1901 by the Oxford English Dictionary. The relationship between sounds and letters is the backbone of traditional phonics.

This principle was first presented by John Hart in 1570. Prior to that children learned to read through the ABC method, by which they recited the letters used in each word, from a familiar piece of text such as Genesis. It was John Hart who first suggested that the focus should be on the relationship between what is now referred to as graphemes and phonemes.

For more information see Practices by country or region (below); and History of learning to read.

===Phonemic awareness===
Not to be confused with phonics, phonemic awareness (PA) is the ability to hear, identify, and manipulate the individual spoken sounds of language, independent of writing. Phonemic awareness is part of oral language ability and is critical for learning to read. To assess phonemic awareness, or teach it explicitly, learners are given a variety of exercises, such as adding a sound (e.g., &quot;Add the th sound to the beginning of the word ink&quot;), changing a sound (e.g., &quot;In the word sing, change the ng sound to the t sound)&quot;, or removing a sound (e.g., &quot;In the word park, remove the p sound)&quot;. Phonemic awareness and the resulting knowledge of spoken language is the most important determinant of a child&#x27;s early reading success. Phonemic awareness is sometimes taught separately from phonics and at other times it is the result of phonics instruction (i.e. segmenting or blending phonemes with letters).
It is that part of phonological awareness that is concerned with phonemes.

===The alphabetic principle (also: The alphabetic code)===
English spelling is based on the alphabetic principle. In the education field it is also referred to as &quot;the alphabetic code&quot;. In an alphabetic writing system, letters are used to represent speech sounds, or phonemes. For example, the word &quot;cat&quot; is spelled with three letters, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;t&quot;, each representing a phoneme, respectively, , , and .

The spelling structures for some alphabetic languages, such as Spanish, Russian and German, are comparatively orthographically transparent, or orthographically shallow, because there is nearly a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letter patterns that represent them. English spelling is more complex, a deep orthography, partly because it attempts to represent the 40+ phonemes of the spoken language with an alphabet composed of only 26 letters (and no accent marks or diacritics). As a result, two letters are often used together to represent distinct sounds, referred to as &quot;digraphs&quot;. For example, &quot;t&quot; and &quot;h&quot; placed side by side to represent either as in &quot;math&quot; or as in &quot;father&quot;.

English has absorbed many words from other languages throughout its history, usually without changing the spelling of those words. As a result, the written form of English includes the spelling patterns of many languages (Old English, Old Norse, Norman French, Classical Latin and Greek, as well as numerous modern languages) superimposed upon one another. These overlapping spelling patterns mean that in many cases the same sound can be spelled differently (e.g., tr&quot;ay&quot; and br&quot;ea&quot;k) and the same spelling can represent different sounds (e.g., m&quot;oo&quot;n and b&quot;oo&quot;k). However, the spelling patterns usually follow certain conventions. In addition, the Great Vowel Shift, a historical linguistic process in which the quality of many vowels in English changed while the spelling remained as it was, greatly diminished the transparency of English spelling in relation to pronunciation.

The result is that English spelling patterns vary considerably in the degree to which they follow rules. For example, the letters &quot;ee&quot; almost always represent (e.g., &quot;meet&quot;), but the sound can also be represented by the letters &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot; and &quot;y&quot; and digraphs &quot;ie&quot;, &quot;ei&quot;, or &quot;ea&quot; (e.g., sh&quot;e&quot;, sard&quot;i&quot;ne, sunn&quot;y&quot;, ch&quot;ie&quot;f, s&quot;ei&quot;ze, &quot;ea&quot;t). Similarly, the letter cluster &quot;ough&quot; represents as in en&quot;ough&quot;, as in th&quot;ough&quot;, as in thr&quot;ough&quot;, as in c&quot;ough&quot;, as in b&quot;ough&quot;, as in b&quot;ough&quot;t, and as in hicc&quot;ough&quot;, while in sl&quot;ough&quot; and l&quot;ough&quot;, the pronunciation varies.

Although the patterns are inconsistent, when English spelling rules take into account syllable structure, phonetics, etymology, and accents, there are dozens of rules that are 75% or more reliable. This level of reliability can only be achieved by extending the rules far outside the domain of phonics, which deals with letter-sound correspondences, and into the morphophonemic and morphological domains.

==Alternative spellings of the sounds==

The following are a selection of the alternative spellings of the 40+ sounds of the English language based on General American English pronunciation, recognizing there are many regional variations. Teachers of synthetic phonics emphasize the letter sounds not the letter names (i.e. &quot;mmm not em, sss not ess, fff not ef&quot;). It is usually recommended that teachers of English-reading introduce the &quot;most frequent sounds&quot; and the &quot;common spellings&quot; first and save the more infrequent sounds and complex spellings for later. (e.g., the sounds /s/ and /t/ before /v/ and /w/; and the spellings cake before eight and cat before duck).

==Vowel and consonant phonics patterns==

The following is an explanation of many of the phonics patterns.

===Vowel phonics patterns===

* Short vowels are the five single letter vowels, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, and &quot;u&quot;, when they produce the sounds as in &quot;cat&quot;, as in &quot;bet&quot;, as in &quot;sit&quot;, as in &quot;hot&quot;, and as in &quot;cup&quot;. The term &quot;short vowel&quot; is historical, and meant that at one time (in Middle English) these vowels were pronounced for a particularly short period of time; currently, it means just that they are not diphthongs like the long vowels.
* Long vowels have the same sound as the names of the vowels, such as in &quot;bay&quot;, in &quot;bee&quot;, in &quot;mine&quot;, in &quot;no&quot;, and in &quot;use&quot;. The way that educators use the term &quot;long vowels&quot; differs from the way in which linguists use this term. Careful educators use the term &quot;long vowel letters&quot; or &quot;long vowels&quot;, not &quot;long vowel sounds&quot;, since four of the five long vowels (long vowel letters) in fact represent combinations of sounds (a, i, o, and u, that is in &quot;bay&quot;, in &quot;mine&quot;, in &quot;no&quot;, and in &quot;use&quot;) and only one consists of a single vowel sound that is long ( in &quot;bee&quot;), which is how linguists use the term. In classrooms, long vowels are taught as having &quot;the same sounds as the names of the letters&quot;. Teachers teach the children that a long vowel &quot;says its name&quot;.
* Schwa is the third sound that most of the single vowel spellings can represent. It is the indistinct sound of many a vowel in an unstressed syllable, and is represented by the linguistic symbol ; it is the sound of the &quot;o&quot; in &quot;lesson&quot;, of the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;sofa&quot;. Although it is the most common vowel sound in spoken English, schwa is not always taught to elementary school students because some find it difficult to understand. However, some educators make the argument that schwa should be included in primary reading programs because of its vital importance in the correct pronunciation of English words.
* Closed syllables are syllables in which a single vowel letter is followed by a consonant. In the word &quot;button&quot;, both syllables are closed syllables (but.ton) because they contain single vowels followed by consonants. Therefore, the letter &quot;u&quot; represents the short sound . (The &quot;o&quot; in the second syllable makes the sound because it is an unstressed syllable.)
* Open syllables are syllables in which a vowel appears at the end of the syllable. The vowel will say its long sound. In the word &quot;basin&quot;, &quot;ba&quot; is an open syllable and therefore says .
* Diphthongs are linguistic elements that fuse two adjacent vowel sounds. English has four common diphthongs. The commonly recognized diphthongs are as in &quot;cow&quot; and as in &quot;boil&quot;. Three of the long vowels are also in fact combinations of two vowel sounds, in other words diphthongs: as in &quot;I&quot; or &quot;mine&quot;, as in &quot;no&quot;, and as in &quot;bay&quot;, which partly accounts for the reason they are considered &quot;long&quot;.
* Vowel digraphs are those spelling patterns wherein two letters are used to represent a vowel sound. The &quot;ai&quot; in &quot;sail&quot; is a vowel digraph. Because the first letter in a vowel digraph sometimes says its long vowel sound, as in &quot;sail&quot;, some phonics programs once taught that &quot;when two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking.&quot; This convention has been almost universally discarded owing to the many non-examples, such as the &quot;au&quot; spelling of the sound and the &quot;oo&quot; spelling of the and sounds, neither of which follow this pattern.
* Vowel-consonant-E spellings are those wherein a single vowel letter, followed by a consonant and the letter &quot;e&quot; makes the long vowel sound. The tendency is often referred to as &quot;the silent E&quot; or &quot;the magic E&quot; with examples such as &quot;bake&quot;, &quot;theme&quot;, &quot;hike&quot;, &quot;cone&quot;, and &quot;cute&quot;. (The &quot;ee&quot; spelling, as in &quot;meet&quot; is sometimes, but inconsistently, considered part of this pattern.)
* R-controlled syllables include those wherein a vowel followed by an &quot;r&quot; has a different sound from its regular pattern. For example, a word like &quot;car&quot; should have the pattern of a &quot;closed syllable&quot; because it has one vowel and ends in a consonant. However, the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;car&quot; does not have its regular &quot;short&quot; sound ( as in &quot;cat&quot;) because it is controlled by the &quot;r&quot;. The &quot;r&quot; changes the sound of the vowel that precedes it. Other examples include: park, horn, her, bird, and burn.
* The Consonant-le syllable is a final syllable, located at the end of the base/root word. It contains a consonant, followed by the letters &quot;le&quot;. The &quot;e&quot; is silent and is present because it was pronounced in earlier English and the spelling is historical. Examples are: candle, stable and apple.

===Consonant phonics patterns===
* Consonant digraphs are those spellings wherein two letters are used to represent a single consonant phoneme. The most common consonant digraphs are &quot;ch&quot; for , &quot;ng&quot; for , &quot;ph&quot; for , &quot;sh&quot; for , &quot;th&quot; for and . Letter combinations like &quot;wr&quot; for and &quot;kn&quot; for are technically also consonant digraphs, although they are so rare that they are sometimes considered patterns with &quot;silent letters&quot;.
* Short vowel+consonant patterns involve the spelling of the sounds as in &quot;peek&quot;, as in &quot;stage&quot;, and as in &quot;speech&quot;. These sounds each have two possible spellings at the end of a word, &quot;ck&quot; and &quot;k&quot; for , &quot;dge&quot; and &quot;ge&quot; for , and &quot;tch&quot; and &quot;ch&quot; for . The spelling is determined by the type of vowel that precedes the sound. If a short vowel precedes the sound, the former spelling is used, as in &quot;pick&quot;, &quot;judge&quot;, and &quot;match&quot;. If a short vowel does not precede the sound, the latter spelling is used, as in &quot;took&quot;, &quot;barge&quot;, and &quot;launch&quot;.

These patterns are just a few examples out of dozens that can be used to help learners unpack the challenging English alphabetic code. While complex, many believe English spelling does retain order and reason.

==Effectiveness of programs and evidence-based education==

Researchers such as Joseph Torgesen estimate that &quot;between four and six percent&quot; of children would still have weak word reading skills even if they were exposed to effective interventions in the first or second year of school. Yet, in the USA 20% or more do not meet grade expectations.

According to the 2019 Nation&#x27;s Report card, 34% of grade four students in the United States failed to perform at or above the &quot;Basic reading level&quot;. There was a significant difference by race and ethnicity (e.g., black students at 52% and white students at 23%). After the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the average basic reading score dropped by 3% in 2022.

Between 2013 and 2027, 37 US States have passed laws or implemented new policies related to evidence-based reading instruction. As a result, many schools are moving away from balance literacy programs that encourage students to guess a word, and are introducing phonics where they learn to &quot;decode&quot; (sound out) words.

The Canadian provinces of Ontario and Nova Scotia, respectively, reported that 26% and 30% of grade three students did not meet the provincial reading standards in 2019. In Ontario, 53% of Grade 3 students with special education needs (students who have an Individual Education Plan), were not meeting the provincial standard. In 2022, the Minister of Education for Ontario said they are taking immediate action to improve student literacy and making longer-term reforms to modernize the way reading is taught and assessed in schools, with a focus on phonics. Their plan includes &quot;revising the elementary Language curriculum and the Grade 9 English course with scientific, evidence-based approaches that emphasize direct, explicit and systematic instruction, and removing references to unscientific discovery and inquiry-based learning, including the three-cueing system, by 2023.&quot;

Proponents of evidence-based reading instruction maintain that teaching reading without teaching phonics can be harmful to large numbers of students, although in their view not all phonics teaching programs are equally effective. According to them, the effectiveness of a program depends on using specific curriculum and instruction techniques, classroom management, grouping, and other factors. Phonics instruction is also an important part of the science of reading.

Interest in evidence-based education appears to be growing. In 2019, Best Evidence Encyclopedia (BEE) released a review of research on 48 different programs for struggling readers in elementary schools. Many of the programs used phonics-based teaching and/or one or more of the following: cooperative learning, technology-supported adaptive instruction (see Educational technology), metacognitive skills, phonemic awareness, word reading, fluency, vocabulary, multisensory learning, spelling, guided reading, reading comprehension, word analysis, structured curriculum, and balanced literacy (non-phonetic approach).

The BEE review concludes that a) outcomes were positive for one-to-one tutoring, b) outcomes were positive but not as large for one-to-small group tutoring, c) there were no differences in outcomes between teachers and teaching assistants as tutors, d) technology-supported adaptive instruction did not have positive outcomes, e) whole-class approaches (mostly cooperative learning) and whole-school approaches incorporating tutoring obtained outcomes for struggling readers as large as those found for one-to-one tutoring, and benefitted many more students, and f) approaches mixing classroom and school improvements, with tutoring for the most at-risk students, have the greatest potential for the largest numbers of struggling readers.

Robert Slavin, of BEE, goes so far as to suggest that states should &quot;hire thousands of tutors&quot; to support students scoring far below grade level – particularly in elementary school reading. Research, he says, shows &quot;only tutoring, both one-to-one and one-to-small group, in reading and mathematics, had an effect size larger than +0.10 ... averages are around +0.30&quot;, and &quot;well-trained teaching assistants using structured tutoring materials or software can obtain outcomes as good as those obtained by certified teachers as tutors&quot;.

Other evidence-based comparison databases featuring phonics and other methods include Evidence for ESSA (Center for Research and Reform in Education) (meeting the standards of the U.S. Every Student Succeeds Act, and the What Works Clearinghouse.

==Teaching reading with phonics==

===Combining phonics with other literacy instruction===

There are many ways that phonics is taught and it is often taught together with some of the following: oral language skills, concepts about print, phonological awareness, phonemic awareness, phonology, oral fluency, vocabulary, syllables, reading comprehension, spelling, word study, cooperative learning, multisensory learning, and guided reading. And, phonics is often featured in discussions about science of reading, and evidence-based practices.

The National Reading Panel (U.S. 2000) suggests that phonics be taught together with phonemic awareness, oral fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. Timothy Shanahan, a member of that panel, suggests that primary students receive 60–90 minutes per day of explicit, systematic, literacy instruction time; and that it be divided equally between a) words and word parts (e.g., letters, sounds, decoding and phonemic awareness), b) oral reading fluency, c) reading comprehension, and d) writing. Furthermore, he states that &quot;the phonemic awareness skills found to give the greatest reading advantage to kindergarten and first-grade children are &quot;segmenting and blending&quot;&quot;.

The Ontario Association of Deans of Education (Canada) published research Monograph # 37 entitled &quot;Supporting early language and literacy&quot; with suggestions for parents and teachers in helping children prior to grade one. It covers the areas of letter names and letter-sound correspondence (phonics), as well as conversation, play-based learning, print, phonological awareness, shared reading, and vocabulary.

===Sight words and sight vocabulary===

Sight words (i.e. high-frequency or common words) are &quot;not&quot; a part of the phonics method. They are usually associated with whole language and balanced literacy where students are expected to memorize common words such as those on the Dolch word list and the Fry word list (e.g., a, be, call, do, eat, fall, gave, etc.). The supposition (in whole language) is that students will learn to read more easily if they memorize the most common words they will encounter, especially words that are not easily decoded (i.e. exceptions). However, according to research, whole-word memorisation is &quot;labor-intensive&quot;, requiring on average about 35 trials per word.

On the other hand, phonics advocates say that most words are decodable, so comparatively few words have to be memorized. And because a child will over time encounter many low-frequency words, &quot;the phonological recoding mechanism is a very powerful, indeed essential, mechanism throughout reading development&quot;. Furthermore, researchers suggest that teachers who withhold phonics instruction to make it easier on children &quot;are having the opposite effect&quot; by making it harder for children to gain basic word-recognition skills. They suggest that learners should focus on understanding the principles of phonics so they can recognize the phonemic overlaps among words (e.g., have, had, has, having, haven&#x27;t, etc.), making it easier to decode them all.

Sight vocabulary is a part of the phonics method. It describes words that are stored in long-term memory and read automatically. Skilled fully-alphabetic readers learn to store words in long-term memory without memorization (i.e. a mental dictionary), making reading and comprehension easier. The process, called &quot;orthographic mapping&quot;, involves &quot;decoding, crosschecking, mental marking and rereading&quot;. It takes significantly less time than memorization. This process works for fully-alphabetic readers when reading simple decodable words from left to right through the word. &quot;Irregular words&quot; pose more of a challenge, yet research in 2018 concluded that &quot;fully-alphabetic students&quot; learn irregular words more easily when they use a process called &quot;hierarchical decoding&quot;. In this process, students, rather than decode from left to right, are taught to focus attention on the irregular elements such as a vowel-digraph and a silent-e; for example, &quot;break (b - r - ea - k), height (h - eigh - t), touch (t - ou - ch), and make (m - a- ke)&quot;. Consequentially, they suggest that teachers and tutors should focus on &quot;teaching decoding with more advanced vowel patterns before expecting young readers to tackle irregular words&quot;.

===Systematic phonics===
&quot;Systematic phonics&quot; is not one specific method of teaching phonics; it is a term used to describe phonics approaches that are taught &quot;explicitly&quot; and in a structured, systematic manner. They are &quot;systematic&quot; because the letters and the sounds they relate to are taught in a specific sequence, as opposed to incidentally or on a &quot;when needed&quot; basis.

Systematic phonics is sometimes mischaracterized as &quot;skill and drill&quot; with little attention to meaning. However, researchers point out that this impression is false. Teachers can use engaging games or materials to teach letter-sound connections, and it can also be incorporated with the reading of meaningful text.

Phonics can be taught systematically in a variety of ways, such as: synthetic phonics, analytic phonics and analogy phonics. However, their effectiveness vary considerably because the methods differ in such areas as the range of letter-sound coverage, the structure of the lesson plans, and the time devoted to specific instructions.

Systematic phonics has gained increased acceptance in different parts of the world since the completion of three major studies into teaching reading; one in the United States in 2000, another in Australia in 2005, and another in the UK in 2006.

In 2009, the UK Department of Education published a curriculum review that added support for systematic phonics, which in the UK is known as synthetic phonics. Beginning as early as 2014, several States in the United States have changed their curriculum to include systematic phonics instruction in elementary school. In 2018, the State Government of Victoria, Australia, published a website containing a comprehensive Literacy Teaching Toolkit including Effective Reading Instruction, Phonics, and Sample Phonics Lessons.

===Synthetic phonics===

&quot;Synthetic phonics&quot;, also known as blended phonics, is a method employed to teach students to read by &quot;sounding out&quot; the letters then &quot;blending&quot; the sounds to form the word. This method involves learning how letters or letter groups represent individual sounds, and that those sounds are blended to form a word. For example, &quot;shrouds&quot; would be read by pronouncing the sounds for each spelling, &quot;sh,r,ou,d,s&quot; (IPA ), then blending those sounds orally to produce a spoken word, &quot;sh - r - ou - d - s = shrouds&quot; (IPA ). The goal of either a blended phonics or synthetic phonics instructional program is that students identify the sound-symbol correspondences and blend their phonemes automatically. Since 2005, synthetic phonics has become the accepted method of teaching reading (by phonics instruction) in the United Kingdom and Australia. In the United States, a pilot program using the Core Knowledge Early Literacy program that used this type of phonics approach showed significantly higher results in K–3 reading compared with comparison schools. In addition, several States such as California, Ohio, New York and Arkansas, are promoting the principles of synthetic phonics (see synthetic phonics in the US).

===Analytic phonics and analogy phonics===
&quot;Analytic phonics&quot; does not involve pronouncing individual sounds (phonemes) in isolation and blending the sounds, as is done in synthetic phonics. Rather, it is taught at the word level and students learn to analyze letter-sound relationships once the word is identified. For example, students analyze letter-sound correspondences such as the &quot;ou&quot; spelling of in shrouds. Also, students might be asked to practice saying words with similar sounds such as ball, bat and bite. Furthermore, students are taught consonant blends (separate, adjacent consonants) as units, such as break or shrouds.

&quot;Analogy phonics&quot; is a particular type of &quot;analytic phonics&quot; in which the teacher has students analyze phonic elements according to the speech sounds (phonograms) in the word. One method is referred to as the &quot;onset-rime)&quot; approach. The onset is the initial sound and the rime is the vowel and the consonant sounds that follow it. For example, in the words &quot;cat, mat and sat,&quot; the rime is at.) Teachers using the analogy method may have students memorize a bank of phonograms, such as &quot;-at&quot; or &quot;-am&quot;.

Teachers might also teach students about &quot;word families&quot; (e.g., can, ran, man, or may, play, say). When students are exposed to different word families, they are able to identify, analyze and construct different rhyming word patterns. An example of a student&#x27;s increasing ability to construct a rhyming word pattern with the &quot;oa&quot; grapheme would be as follows: &quot;road, toad, load and goad&quot;. Examples of other recognizable graphemes that allow students to construct rhyming word patterns are &quot;at, igh, ew, oo, ou&quot; and &quot;air&quot;. More letter combinations or graphemes can be viewed in the table below to support students increasing ability to construct a rhyming word pattern of similar phonemes or speech sound:

Letter combinations or graphemes of new words should have letters students have already learned and can recognize on their own.

There have been many experimental research studies and correlational data studies conducted on the effectiveness of instruction using analytic phonics and synthetic phonics. Johnston et al. (2012) conducted experimental research studies that tested the effectiveness of phonics learning instruction among 10 year old boys and girls. They used comparative data from the Clackmannanshire Report and chose 393 participants to compare synthetic phonics instruction and analytic phonics instruction. The boys taught by the synthetic phonics method had better word reading than the girls in their classes, and their spelling and reading comprehension was as good. On the other hand, with analytic phonics teaching, although the boys performed as well as the girls in word reading, they had inferior spelling and reading comprehension. Overall, the group taught by synthetic phonics had better word reading, spelling, and reading comprehension. And, synthetic phonics did not lead to any impairment in the reading of irregular words.

===Embedded phonics with mini-lessons===
&quot;Embedded phonics&quot;, also known as &quot;Incidental phonics&quot;, is the type of phonics instruction used in whole language programs. It is not &quot;systematic phonics&quot;. Although phonics skills are de-emphasised in whole language programs, some teachers include phonics &quot;mini-lessons&quot; when students struggle with words while reading from a book. Short lessons are included based on phonics elements the students are having trouble with, or on a new or difficult phonics pattern that appears in a class reading assignment. The focus on meaning is generally maintained, but the mini-lesson provides some time for focus on individual sounds and the letters that represent them. Embedded phonics is different from other methods because instruction is always in the context of literature rather than in separate lessons about distinct sounds and letters; and skills are taught when an opportunity arises, not systematically.

===Phonics through spelling===
For some teachers this is a method of teaching spelling by using the sounds (phonemes). However, it can also be a method of teaching reading by focusing on the sounds and their spelling (i.e. phonemes and syllables). It is taught systematically with guided lessons conducted in a direct and explicit manner including appropriate feedback. Sometimes mnemonic cards containing individual sounds are used to allow the student to practice saying the sounds that are related to a letter or letters (e.g., &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot;). Accuracy comes first, followed by speed. The sounds may be grouped by categories such as vowels that sound short (e.g., c-a-t and s-i-t). When the student is comfortable recognizing and saying the sounds, the following steps might be followed: a) the tutor says a target word and the student repeats it out loud, b) the student writes down each individual sound (letter) until the word is completely spelled, saying each sound as it is written, and c) the student says the entire word out loud. An alternate method would be to have the student use mnemonic cards to sound-out (spell) the target word.

Typically, the instruction starts with sounds that have only one letter and simple CVC words such as &quot;sat&quot; and &quot;pin&quot;. Then it progresses to longer words, and sounds with more than one letter (e.g., hear and day), and perhaps even syllables (e.g., wa-ter). Sometimes the student practices saying (or sounding-out) cards that contain entire words.

==The Reading Wars – phonics vs. whole language==

A debate has been going on for decades about the merits of phonics vs. whole language, often known in the UK as &quot;look and say&quot;. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Reading Wars&quot;.

Phonics was a popular way to learn reading in the 19th century. William Holmes McGuffey (1800–1873), an American educator, author, and Presbyterian minister who had a lifelong interest in teaching children, compiled the first four of the McGuffey Readers in 1836.

Then, in 1841 Horace Mann, the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education, advocated for a whole-word method of teaching reading to replace phonics. Rudolf Flesch advocated for a return to phonics in his book &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Read&quot; (1955).

The whole-word method received support from Kenneth J. Goodman who wrote an article in 1967 entitled &quot;Reading: A psycholinguistic guessing game&quot;. In it, he says efficient reading is the result of the &quot;skill in selecting the fewest, most productive cues necessary to produce guesses which are right the first time&quot;. Although not supported by scientific studies, the theory became very influential as the whole language method. Since the 1970s some whole language supporters such as Frank Smith, are unyielding in arguing that phonics should be taught little, if at all.

Yet other researchers say instruction in phonics and phonemic awareness are &quot;critically important&quot; and &quot;essential&quot; to develop early reading skills. In 2000, the US National Reading Panel identified five ingredients of effective reading instruction, of which phonics is one; the other four are phonemic awareness, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. Reports from other countries, such as the Australian report on &quot;Teaching reading&quot; (2005) and the Independent review of the teaching of early reading (Rose Report 2006) from the UK have also supported the use of phonics.

Some notable researchers have clearly stated their disapproval of whole language. Cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene has said, &quot;cognitive psychology directly refutes any notion of teaching via a &#x27;global&#x27; or &#x27;whole language&#x27; method.&quot; He goes on to talk about &quot;the myth of whole-word reading&quot; (also: sight words), saying it has been refuted by recent experiments. &quot;We do not recognize a printed word through a holistic grasping of its contours, because our brain breaks it down into letters and graphemes.&quot; Mark Seidenberg refers to whole language as a &quot;theoretical zombie&quot; because it persists in spite of a lack of supporting evidence.

Furthermore, a 2017 study published in the &quot;Journal of Experimental Psychology&quot; compared teaching with phonics vs. teaching whole written words and concluded that phonics is more effective. It states &quot;Our results suggest that early literacy education should focus on the systematicities present in print-to-sound relationships in alphabetic languages, rather than teaching meaning-based strategies, in order to enhance both reading aloud and comprehension of written words&quot;.

More recently, some educators have advocated for the theory of balanced literacy purported to combine phonics and whole language yet not necessarily in a consistent or systematic manner. It may include elements such as word study and phonics mini-lessons, differentiated learning, cueing, leveled reading, shared reading, guided reading, independent reading and sight words. According to a survey in 2010, 68% of K–2 teachers in the United States practice balanced literacy; however, only 52% of teachers included &quot;phonics&quot; in their definition of &quot;balanced literacy&quot;. In addition, 75% of teachers teach the three-cueing system (i.e., meaning/structure/visual or semantic/syntactic/graphophonic) that has its roots in whole language.

In addition, some phonics supporters assert that &quot;balanced literacy&quot; is merely &quot;whole language&quot; by another name. And critics of whole language and sceptics of balanced literacy, such as neuroscientist Mark Seidenberg, state that struggling readers should &quot;not&quot; be encouraged to skip words they find puzzling or rely on semantic and syntactic cues to guess words.

Over time a growing number of countries and states have put greater emphasis on phonics and other evidence-based practices (see Practices by country or region below).

===Simple view of reading===
The &quot;simple view of reading&quot; is a scientific theory about reading comprehension. The creators of the theory hoped it would help to end the reading wars. According to the theory, in order to comprehend what they are reading students need both &quot;decoding skills&quot; and oral &quot;language comprehension ability&quot;; neither is enough on their own.

The formula is: Decoding × Oral Language Comprehension = Reading Comprehension.

Students are not reading if they can decode words but do not understand their meaning. Similarly, students are not reading if they cannot decode words that they would ordinarily recognize and understand if they heard them spoken out loud.

==Practices by country or region==

The following are examples of how phonics is used in some countries:

=== Australia ===

On 30 November 2004 Brendan Nelson, Minister for Education, Science and Training, established a National Inquiry into the Teaching of Literacy in Australia. The Inquiry examined the way reading is taught in schools, as well as the effectiveness of teacher education courses in preparing teachers for reading instruction. In the resulting report in 2005, &quot;Teaching Reading&quot;, the first two recommendations make clear the committee&#x27;s conviction about the need to base the teaching of reading on evidence and the importance of teaching systematic, explicit phonics within an integrated approach.

The executive summary states, &quot;The evidence is clear ... that direct systematic instruction in phonics during the early years of schooling is an essential foundation for teaching children to read. Findings from the research evidence indicate that all students learn best when teachers adopt an integrated approach to reading that explicitly teaches phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary knowledge and comprehension.&quot; The Inquiry Committee also states that the apparent dichotomy between phonics and the whole-Language approach to teaching &quot;is false&quot;. However, it goes on to say &quot;It was clear, however, that systematic phonics instruction is critical if children are to be taught to read well, whether or not they experience reading difficulties.&quot;

In the executive summary it goes on to say the following:

&quot;Overall we conclude that the synthetic phonics approach, as part of the reading curriculum, is more effective than the analytic phonics approach, even when it is supplemented with phonemic awareness training. It also led boys to reading words significantly better than girls, and there was a trend towards better spelling and reading comprehension. There is evidence that synthetic phonics is best taught at the beginning of Primary 1, as even by the end of the second year at school the children in the early synthetic phonics programme had better spelling ability, and the girls had significantly better reading ability.&quot;

As of October 5, 2018, The State Government of Victoria, Australia, publishes a website containing a comprehensive Literacy Teaching Toolkit including Effective Reading Instruction, Phonics, and Sample Phonics Lessons. It contains elements of synthetic phonics, analytical phonics, and analogy phonics.

In 2016 Australia ranked 21st in the PIRLS reading achievement for students in their fourth year of school.

===Canada===

In Canada, public education is the responsibility of the Provincial and Territorial governments. As in other countries there has been much debate on the value of phonics in teaching reading in English; however, phonemic awareness and phonics appears to be receiving some attention. The curriculum of all of the Canadian provinces include some of the following: phonics, phonological awareness, segmenting and blending, decoding, phonemic awareness, graphophonic cues, and letter-sound relationships. In addition, systematic phonics and synthetic phonics receive attention in some publications.
However, some of the practices of whole language are evident, such as:
* British Columbia – &quot;consistently using three cueing systems, meaning, structure, and visual&quot; and &quot;using illustrations and prior knowledge to predict meaning&quot;,
* Alberta – &quot;using cues such as pictures, context, phonics, grammatical awareness and background knowledge&quot; and &quot;use a variety of strategies, such as making predictions, rereading and reading on&quot;,
* Saskatchewan – &quot;using the cueing systems to construct meaning from the text&quot;,
* Manitoba – &quot;use syntactic, semantic, and graphophonic cues to construct and confirm meaning in context&quot;,
* Ontario – &quot;predict the meaning of and solve unfamiliar words using different types of cues, including: semantic (meaning) cues, syntactic (language structure) cues, and graphophonic (phonological and graphic) cues,
* Quebec – &quot;use of pictures and other graphic representations to interpret texts&quot;,
* Nova Scotia – &quot;cueing systems (context, meaning, structure and visual)&quot;; &quot;predict on the basis of what makes sense, what sounds right, and what the print suggests&quot;; &quot;balanced literacy program&quot; and &quot;search for and use meaning and structure and/or visual information (MSV)&quot;, and
* Newfoundland and Labrador – &quot;use and integrate, with support, the various cueing systems (pragmatic, semantic, syntactic, and graphophonic).

Consequentially, with the exception of those indicated below, there appears to be no evidence of a comprehensive or systematic practice of phonics in most of Canada&#x27;s public schools.

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Canada ranked 23rd in the PIRLS reading achievement for students in their fourth year of school.

In 2018, Canada ranked 6th out of 78 countries in the PISA reading scores for 15-year-old students. However, critics say PISA is fundamentally flawed, and in 2014 more than 100 academics from around the world called for a moratorium on PISA.

In 2021, the province of New Brunswick introduced a new English Language Arts curriculum that includes phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and reading comprehension. Notably, the teaching of alphabetic skills based on the science of reading has replaced the use of various cueing systems and a variety of strategies to construct meaning from text.

On January 27, 2022, the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) released a report on its public inquiry into the right to read. It followed the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, on November 9, 2012, recognizing that learning to read is not a privilege, but a basic and essential human right.

The OHRC&#x27;s report deals with all students, not just those with learning disabilities. The inquiry found that Ontario is not fulfilling its obligations to meet students&#x27; right to read. Specifically, foundational word-reading skills are not effectively targeted in Ontario&#x27;s education system. With science-based approaches to reading instruction, early screening, and intervention, we should see only about 5% of students reading below grade level. However, in 2018–2019, 26% of all Ontario Grade 3 students and 53% of Grade 3 students with special education needs (students who have an Individual Education Plan), were not meeting the provincial EQAO standard. The results improved only slightly for Grade 6 students, where 19% of all students and 47% of students with special education needs did not meet the provincial standard.

The Ontario curriculum encourages the use of the three-cueing system and balanced literacy, which are ineffective because they teach children to &quot;guess&quot; the meaning of a word rather than sound it out. What is required is a) evidence-based curriculum and instruction (including explicit and systematic instruction in phonemic awareness and phonics), b) evidence-based screening assessments, c) evidence-based reading interventions, d) accommodations that are not used as a substitute for teaching students to read, and e) professional assessments (yet, not required for interventions or accommodations).

The Minister of Education for Ontario responded to this report by saying the government is taking immediate action to improve student literacy and making longer-term reforms to modernize the way reading is taught and assessed in schools, with a focus on phonics. Their plan includes &quot;revising the elementary Language curriculum and the Grade 9 English course with scientific, evidence-based approaches that emphasize direct, explicit and systematic instruction and removing references to unscientific discovery and inquiry-based learning, including the three-cueing system, by 2023.&quot; In January 2024, the province unveiled a back-to-basics kindergarten curriculum. It will provide evidence-based clear and direct instruction in literacy, including understanding sound-letter relationships, developing phonics knowledge, and using specific vocabulary.

===Finland===

Before the beginning of school, usually at the age of 7, most children in Finland participate in one year of preprimary education. Most children already learn to read before they start school.

Since letters in Finnish words almost always represent the same sounds (and almost all sounds are represented by only one letter), most words are orthographically transparent making them comparatively easy to read.

At the primary level, reading and writing difficulties are the second most common reason (after speech disorders) for part-time special education. The most commonly used standardized reading test is the Comprehensive School Reading Test, covering linguistic awareness, &quot;decoding&quot;, and reading comprehension.
In the case of minor reading difficulties, the classroom teacher may give remedial instruction to students, whereas a special education teacher will help with more severe or more persistent reading difficulties. If these support measures are inadequate, students may receive enhanced support or be transferred to full-time special education, depending on individual teaching and learning plans.

In the fourth year of school, the basic teaching techniques consist of ample practice of &quot;sound-letter correspondence&quot;; breaking down speech into words, syllables, and sounds; word recognition; and spelling at the sound and sentence level; daily reading and writing; and comprehension strategies.

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Finland ranked 5th in reading achievement for students in their fourth year of school according to the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).

=== France ===

There has been a strong debate in France on the teaching of phonics (&quot;méthode syllabique&quot;) versus whole language (&quot;méthode globale&quot;). After the 1990s, supporters of the latter started defending a so-called &quot;mixed method&quot; (also known as balanced literacy) in which approaches from both methods are used. France is home to some of the most influential researchers in psycho-pedagogy, cognitive sciences and neurosciences, such as Stanislas Dehaene and Michel Fayol, who support phonics.

More recently, with the appointment of the academic Jean-Michel Blanquer as minister of education, the ministry created a science educational council chaired by Dehaene. This council openly supported phonics. In April 2018, the minister issued a set of four guiding documents for early teaching of reading and mathematics and a booklet detailing phonics recommendations. Teachers unions and a few educationalists were very critical of his stances, and classified his perspective as &quot;traditionalist&quot;, trying to bring the debate to the political sphere. But Blanquer has openly declared that the so-called mixed approach is no serious choice.

In 2016, France is slightly above average in Reading Achievement for students in their fourth year of school according to the &quot;Progress in International Reading Literacy Study&quot; (PIRLS).

===Hungary===

The official language and the language of instruction in the Republic of Hungary is the Hungarian language. However, in 2010 4.6% of minority students (Croatians, Germans, Romanians, Serbians, Slovaks, and Slovenes) attended minority operated mother tongue, bilingual, or language teaching schools or kindergartens.

Crèche (nursery school) in Hungary is a &quot;welfare institution&quot; catering for children aged 20 weeks to 3 years and providing professional day care and development. In addition, kindergarten education and care is free and compulsory for children aged 3–6. Socially disadvantaged children are given priority in enrolment. Pre-school programmes focus on developing children&#x27;s emergent literacy skills through play rather than systematic training in phonics or teaching the alphabet.

According to the PIRLS Encyclopedia, the Ministry of Education does not explicitly recommend one particular reading method over another, however all the accredited textbook series use the &quot;sounding-analyzing method&quot;. The &quot;European Literacy Policy Network&quot; (ELINET) 2016 reports that Hungarian children in grades one and two receive explicit instruction in phonemic awareness and phonics &quot;as the route to decode words&quot;. In grades three and four they continue to apply their knowledge of phonics, however the emphasis shifts to the more meaning-focused technical aspects of reading and writing (i.e., vocabulary, types of texts, reading strategies, spelling, punctuation and grammar).

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Hungary achieved the 13th highest score in reading literacy for students in their fourth year of school according to the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS). 19% of their students performed at or below the low benchmark on overall reading, just above the EU average of 20%.

=== Ireland ===

The school curriculum in Ireland focuses on ensuring children are literate in both the English language and the Irish language. In 2011, the Department of Education (Ireland) developed a national strategy to improve literacy and numeracy.
The 2014 teachers&#x27; Professional Development guide covers the seven areas of attitude and motivation, fluency, comprehension, word identification, vocabulary, phonological awareness, phonics, and assessment. It recommends that phonics be taught in a systematic and structured way and is preceded by training in phonological awareness.

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Ireland achieved the 4th highest score in Reading Literacy for students in their fourth year of school according to the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).

The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) for 2018 showed Ireland&#x27;s 15-year-old students were significantly above average in reading, science and mathematics.

The 2019 Primary Language Curriculum specifies that reading outcomes must include phonics, phonological awareness, and phonemic awareness.

===Latin America and the Caribbean===

According to the 2019 Campbell Systematic Reviews approximately 250 million children across the world are not acquiring basic reading and math skills, even though about 50% of them have spent at least 4 years in school (UNESCO 2014). And, more than 60% of third‐grade students in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have only achieved basic reading skills, in part because of the lack of evidence‐based training, preparation and support for teachers.

The review summarizes the findings of 107 studies of early grade literacy interventions (EGL) in LAC. They conclude that teacher training, nutrition, and technology‐in‐education programs on average do not show positive effects on EGL outcomes in the LAC region. However, some factors have the potential for positive impacts; including combining teacher training with coaching, targeting school feeding and other nutrition programs to low‐income countries with high rates of stunting and wasting, and combining technology‐in‐education programs with &quot;a strong focus on pedagogical practices&quot;.

They also suggest that &quot;the quantitative nonintervention studies indicate that phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, and comprehension are associated with reading ability&quot;, and that the poor reading levels of children &quot;may be the consequence of not providing them with adequate instructions on meta-phonological strategies and explicit and systematic phonics&quot;. However, the available studies are unable to provide conclusive evidence on the effects of teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, and comprehension on reading ability, suggesting a need for even more high-quality research.

The &quot;Progress in International Reading Literacy Study&quot; (PIRLS 2016) describes the special reading initiatives in Trinidad and Tobago. In 2013, the National Commission for UNESCO launched the &quot;Leading for Literacy&quot; project to develop the literacy skills of grade 1 and 2 students. The project facilitates the training of primary school teachers in the use of a synthetic phonics program.

From 2013 to 2015, the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Education appointed seven reading specialist to help primary and secondary school teachers improve their literacy instruction. From February 2014 to January 2016, literacy coaches were hired in selected primary schools to assist teachers of kindergarten, grade 1 and grade 2 with pedagogy and content of early literacy instruction. Primary schools have been provided with literacy resources for instruction, including phonemic awareness, word recognition, vocabulary manipulatives, phonics and comprehension.

===New Zealand===

As of 2018, the Ministry of Education in New Zealand has online information to help teachers to support their students in years 1–3 in relation to sounds, letters, and words. It has specific suggestions in the areas of oral language, phonological awareness, phonemic awareness, phonemes and phonics. There are also examples and recommended books concerning phonics instruction, hearing sounds in spoken words, syllables, phoneme blending, onset and rime, and sounds and letters (initial, ending and medial). In its introduction it states that phonics instruction &quot;is not an end in itself&quot; and it is &quot;not&quot; necessary to teach students &quot;every combination of letters and sounds&quot;.

New Zealand&#x27;s score (523) in the 2016 PIRLS report on the reading achievement of students in their fourth year of school was above the average of 500 and below other English speaking countries such as Canada (543), United States (549), England (559), Northern Ireland (565) and Ireland (567).

=== Norway ===
Norwegian is Norway&#x27;s main language and English is taught beginning in grade one. Children enter first grade in August of the year they turn age 6. The majority of students are enrolled in public (government-owned) schools as opposed to private schools.

In the Norwegian curriculum, basic skills include &quot;decoding and comprehension of simple texts&quot; (i.e. phonics). At the end of grade two students are expected to demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between &quot;speech sound and letter&quot;.

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Norway achieved the 8th highest score in Reading Literacy for students in their fourth year of school according to the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), and 20th out of 78 for 15-year-olds in PISA 2018.

=== Poland ===

The national curriculum of Poland considers reading to be the main goal of primary education, defining it as the technical skill of &quot;decoding graphemes into phonemes and understanding, using, and processing written texts&quot; (i.e. phonics). Instruction often consists of telling students how things should be done instead of letting them experiment for themselves and experience the results. According to researchers, teachers seldom use the internet and other digital technologies during reading instruction. Polish schools do not have trained reading specialists, however speech and educational therapists are available to assist students with special needs or learning disabilities. In 1998 a national campaign was introduced to encourage parents to read aloud to their children for 20 minutes every day.

In 2014, 10.6% of 15-year-olds had underachievement in reading, lower than the EU average of 17.8%. Beginning in 2014, a program to provide free schoolbooks was introduced gradually across Poland. Students&#x27; socioeconomic background was a matter of concern in 2015, and six year-olds commenced compulsory schooling in that year.

According to the 2000 International Student Assessment (PISA) 15‑year‑old Polish students read significantly below the OECD average. However, with a renewed emphasis on reading, by 2018 Poland made the most progress in reading since 1994 and Poles ages 16 to 19 exceeded their European peers in reading (10th out of 72 countries in PISA).

Poland ranked 6th in the 2016 PIRLS 4th grade reading achievement.

=== Portugal ===

During the late 1990s the whole language approach gained popularity in Portugal, but in a non-explicit form. Emphasis was placed on meaning, reading for pleasure, and developing a critical approach to the texts. Explicit phonemic awareness and explicit training for reading fluency were considered outdated by some teachers&#x27; organizations.

Poor results in international comparisons led parents and schools to react to this approach and to insist on direct instruction methods. Later, during minister Nuno Crato&#x27;s tenure (2011–2015), who is known to be a vocal critic of constructivist approaches and a supporter of cognitive psychology findings, new standards (&quot;metas&quot;) were put in place. The ministry convened a team led by a well-known specialist in reading, José Morais. This team introduced an explicit phonics teaching approach, putting emphasis on decoding and reading fluency.

Later, international evaluations TIMSS and PISA showed a sharp improvement in the areas of math, reading and science from 2006 to 2015. Portuguese students results raised to above OECD and IEA averages, attaining the best results ever for Portugal. The PISA reading results moved from 472 to 498, above the United States at 497. However, by 2018 Portugal had dropped slightly to 492 and the United States had increased to 505. Some analysts explain these advances by the educational measures Portugal put in place: a more demanding curricula, the emphasis on direct teaching, standardized testing, less ability streaming, and explicit fluency training in reading and mathematics.

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Portugal achieved the 30th highest score in Reading Literacy for students in their fourth year of school according to the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).

=== Russian Federation ===

According to a 1998 report in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, there is some debate in the Russian Federation about phonics vs. whole language, however Olga Viktorovna Pronina, an author and teacher in Moscow, allegedly said that today, most teachers in Russia would tell you they use phonics.

The 2016 international PISA study states that the method widely used now to teach reading in the Russian Federation was developed by the famous psychologist Daniil Elkonin in the 1960s. It says, &quot;students learn to define the sequence of sounds in a word and characterize each sound ... acquiring the knowledge of the phonetic system at an early stage&quot; and &quot;become better familiarized with the skills of reading&quot;.

In 1959, a journal report adds more details about how phonics is used. It says other
observers report that the Russian system in beginning reading is &quot;strictly phonetic&quot;. However, there are no separate phonics lessons, drill periods, drill books, exercises or &quot;gadgets&quot; as you might see in typical American schools. Instead, each new letter-sound is introduced at once in meaningful words the children can pronounce as soon as they know the sound of the new letter. There are no &quot;blending&quot; of the sounds, or &quot;crutches&quot; such as equating the sound of /s/ with a snake. Instead, &quot;all learning is by eye and ear in tandem&quot;, and the association is formed solely between the printed symbol and its sound. And finally, each lesson makes use of exercises to confirm comprehension.

Amongst 50 countries, the Russian Federation achieved the highest score (581) in &quot;Reading Literacy&quot; for students in their fourth year of school according to the 2016 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).

===Singapore===

Singapore has a diverse language environment with four official languages including English which is the language of education and administration. Bilingualism is the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of the education system where students learn both English and their own mother tongue language in school. 99% of children attend preschool education (as early as 18 months of age) although it is not compulsory in Singapore.

The 2001 English Language Syllabus of Singapore advocated &quot;a balance between decoding and meaning-based instruction ... phonics and whole language&quot;. However, a review in 2006 advocated for a &quot;systematic&quot; approach. The subsequent syllabus, in 2010, had no mention of whole language and recommended a balanced, interactive and comprehensive reading programme. It refers to &quot;Learning to Read: The Great Debate&quot; by Jeanne Chall (1967) and the National Reading Panel (2000) both of which supported systematic phonics; and the International Literacy Association (2005) that supported balanced instruction saying phonics is &quot;necessary but insufficient&quot;.

The syllabus for 2010 advocates for a balance between &quot;systematic and explicit instruction&quot; and &quot;a rich language environment&quot;. It called for increased instruction in oral language skills together with phonemic awareness and the key decoding elements of synthetic phonics, analytic phonics and analogy phonics. Specifically, it advocated for instruction in phonic&#x27;s areas such as word families and rimes (e.g., jumps and jumped; bite and kite), segmenting and blending (e.g., , , = cat), vowels, consonants and syllables. And finally, it called for instruction in word study, grammar, vocabulary, writing and comprehension.

Singapore received the second highest reading score (576) after the Russian Federation (581) in the 2016 PIRLS report on grade four students.

===Sweden===

Since the 1860s it was &quot;taken for granted&quot; that phonics is a major part of reading instruction in the first school years in Sweden. However, in the 1990s the National Agency for Education (Sweden) encouraged teachers to try other methods, including whole language.

Sweden&#x27;s performance in the international fourth grade reading assessments (PIRLS) dropped by 19 points from 2001 (561) to 2011 (542) and recovered by 13 points in 2016 (555), still lower than the 2001 results.

Some suggest that the lower scores are related to the increase in immigration.

In 2016 the European Literacy Policy Network (ELINET) published a report on literacy in Sweden saying there is an &quot;urgent need&quot; to address decreases in performance as measured by PIRLS and PISA.

===United Kingdom===
====England &amp; Wales====

There has been a resurgence of interest in synthetic phonics in recent years, particularly in England. As of 2013, all (local-authority-maintained) primary schools in England have a statutory requirement to teach synthetic phonics in years one and two. In addition, any pupil who is struggling to decode words properly by year three must &quot;urgently&quot; receive help through a &quot;rigorous and systematic phonics programme&quot;.

Prior to that, synthetic phonics was promoted by a cross-party group of Parliamentarians, particularly Nick Gibb MP. A report by the House of Commons Education and Skills Committee called for a review of the phonics content in the National Curriculum. Subsequently, the Department for Education and Skills announced a review into early years reading, headed by Sir Jim Rose, former Director of Inspection for Ofsted (responsible for the education standards in the UK). The review, entitled Independent review of the teaching of early reading (Rose Report 2006), addresses the question of why children&#x27;s reading and writing (especially for boys) have not been meeting expectations. Paragraph 3.25 of the Final Report states &quot;This suggests that it is far more often the nature of the teaching than the nature of the child which determines success or failure in learning the &#x27;basic&#x27; skills of reading and writing.&quot; It goes on to say it is not suggesting teachers are unable or unwilling to develop the required expertise, only that there has been systematic confusion and conflicting views about phonics. It also makes it clear that, when it comes to the wider knowledge and skills required for reading and writing, phonics work is &quot;necessary but not sufficient&quot;. It concludes by suggesting the challenge will be resolved as research continues to support systematic phonics, and that teacher training and systematic phonics programs will produce &quot;good results for children&quot;.

By November 2010, a government white paper contained plans to train all primary school teachers in phonics. The 2013 curriculum has &quot;statutory requirements&quot; that, amongst other things, students in years one and two be capable in using systematic synthetic phonics in regards to Word Reading, Reading Comprehension, Fluency, and Writing. This includes having skills in &quot;sound to graphemes&quot;, &quot;decoding&quot;, and &quot;blending&quot;. Following this, Ofsted updated their guidance for school inspectors in 2014 to include tips on how schools should teach reading with systematic phonics, including &quot;Getting them Reading Early&quot;. It includes a description of the simple view of reading as &quot;the word recognition processes&quot; (recognizing the words on the page, free of context and using phonics) and the &quot;language recognition processes&quot; (understanding the meaning of the language). It also includes some videos to illustrate its principles.

In 2015, the Carter Review of Initial Teacher Training (published by the Department for Education calls for evidence-based teaching to be part of the framework for initial teacher training. It gives an example of a case study in which &quot;trainees on the Early Reading placement are required to work alongside a literacy specialist to plan and teach a phonics lesson to a group, evaluate the lesson and deliver a second lesson in light of their evaluation&quot;.

The 2016 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) awarded England its best results since the studies began in 2001. Nick Gibb attributes this success to the use of systematic synthetic phonics. In March of that year the Secretary of State for Education released a report entitled &quot;Educational Excellence Everywhere&quot;. The report states that in 2010 33% percent of primary school students did not achieve the expected standard in reading, however &quot;since the introduction of the phonics reading check in 2012&quot;, that number is down to 20%. The report goes on to say they still have much to do, particularly with students who are disadvantaged. The phonics check involves pupils reading aloud 40 words (including 20 non-words). In 2016, 81 per cent of pupils reached the expected standard of 32 correct words – up from 77 per cent in 2015.
In 2016 the London School of Economics published a paper supporting the teaching of synthetic phonics to disadvantaged children because it helps to close the literacy gap.

In 2018 Ofsted, as part of its curriculum research, has produced a YouTube video on Early Reading. It states &quot;It is absolutely essential that every child master the phonic code as quickly as possible ... So, successful schools firstly teach phonics first, fast and furious.&quot;

In January, 2019 Ofsted published a report entitled &quot;Education inspection framework: overview of research&quot; that further supports &quot;systematic synthetic phonics&quot; together with phonemic awareness, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.

While there has been concern expressed about the phonics screening test at the end of year one, some report that phonics is especially valuable for poor readers and those without English as a first language.

Research published in 2022 by two University College London professors does not recommend the sole use of phonics for developing children&#x27;s literacy. Their work is backed up by a systematic review of 55 research papers. An article about the study, published in The Conversation (website) concludes: The approach to teaching reading in England means that children in England are unlikely to be learning to read as effectively as they should be. Teachers, children, and their parents need a more balanced approach to the teaching of reading. The actual research report describes &quot;balanced instruction&quot; as having a balance of teaching based on the use of whole text and the systematic teaching of the alphabetic code and other linguistic features. In this way, the comprehension of written language is balanced with a range of skills and knowledge. The report places a great deal of emphasis on the PISA study which critics say is &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; and failing in its mission. The report also included an analyses of three Canadian provinces saying Canada, amongst English-dominant nations, is the strongest performer in PISA and PIRLS. In fact, the 2016 PIRLS report places Canada in 23rd place and England in 10th place.

====Northern Ireland====

In 2007 the Department of Education (DE) in Northern Ireland was required by law to teach children foundational skills in phonological awareness and the understanding &quot;that words are made up of sounds and syllables and that sounds are represented by letters (phoneme/grapheme awareness)&quot;.
In 2010 the DE went further by outlining a new strategy with standards requiring that teachers receive support in using evidence-based practices to teach literacy and numeracy. It outlined ten requirements, including a &quot;systematic programme of high-quality phonics&quot; that is explicit, structured, well-paced, interactive, engaging, and applied in a meaningful context.

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Northern Ireland achieved the 7th highest score in Reading Literacy for students in their fourth year of school according to the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).

In 2018, in the PISA Reading Performance of 15-year-old students, Northern Ireland students achieved a score of 505 as compared to England at 507 and the OECD average of 487.

==== Scotland ====

Synthetic phonics in Scotland has its roots in the Clackmannanshire Report, a seven-year study that was published in 2005. It compared analytic Phonics with synthetic Phonics and advantaged students with disadvantaged children. The report found that, using synthetic phonics, children from lower socio-economic backgrounds performed at the same level as children from advantaged backgrounds in primary school (whereas with analytic phonics teaching, they did significantly less well.); and boys performed better than or as well as girls.

A five-year follow-up of the study concluded that the beneficial effects were long-lasting, in fact the reading gains increased.

Subsequently, Education Scotland concluded that explicit, systematic phonics programs, usually embedded in a rich literacy environment, give an additional four months progress over other programs such as whole language, and are particularly beneficial for young learners (aged 4–7). There is evidence, though less secure, that synthetic phonics programs may be more beneficial than analytic phonics programs; however it is most important to teach systematically.

In the PISA 2018 reading results of 15-year-old students, Scotland&#x27;s score was above average, 504 as compared to the OECD average of 487. Scotland does not participate in PIRLS.

===United States===
More than a century of debate has occurred over whether English phonics should or should not be used in teaching beginning reading.

The use of phonics in education in the United States dates at least to the work of Favell Lee Mortimer, whose works using phonics includes the early flashcard set &quot;Reading Disentangled&quot; (1834) and text &quot;Reading Without Tears&quot; (1857). Despite the work of 19th-century proponents such as Rebecca Smith Pollard, some American educators, prominently Horace Mann, argued that phonics should not be taught at all. This led to the commonly used &quot;look-say&quot; approach ensconced in the &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; readers popular in the mid-20th century. Beginning in the 1950s, however, inspired by a landmark study by Dr. Harry E. Houtz, and spurred by Rudolf Flesch&#x27;s criticism of the absence of phonics instruction (particularly in his book, &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Read&quot;, 1955) and Jeanne Chall (the author of &quot;Learning to Read the Great Debate&quot; - 1967–1995 phonics resurfaced as a method of teaching reading.

In the 1980s, the &quot;whole language&quot; approach to reading further polarized the debate in the United States. Whole language instruction was predicated on the principle that children could learn to read given (a) proper motivation, (b) access to good literature, (c) many reading opportunities, (d) focus on meaning, and (e) instruction to help students use semantic, syntactic and graphophonic cues to &quot;guess&quot; the pronunciation of unknown words. Also, in practice children are often taught to use pictures to guess a word. For some advocates of whole language, phonics was antithetical to helping new readers to get the meaning; they asserted that parsing words into small chunks and reassembling them had no connection to the ideas the author wanted to convey.

The whole language emphasis on identifying words using context and focusing only a little on the sounds (usually the alphabet consonants and the short vowels) could not be reconciled with the phonics emphasis on individual sound-symbol correspondences. Thus, a dichotomy between the whole language approach and phonics emerged in the United States causing intense debate. Ultimately, this debate led to a series of Congressionally-commissioned panels and government-funded reviews of the state of reading instruction in the U.S.

In 1984, the National Academy of Education commissioned a report on the status of research and instructional practices in reading education, &quot;Becoming a Nation of Readers&quot;. Among other results, the report includes the finding that phonics instruction improves children&#x27;s ability to identify words. It reports that useful phonics strategies include teaching children the sounds of letters in isolation and in words, and teaching them to blend the sounds of letters together to produce approximate pronunciations of words. It also states that phonics instruction should occur in conjunction with opportunities to identify words in meaningful sentences and stories.

In 1990, Congress asked the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to compile a list of available programs on beginning reading instruction, evaluating each in terms of the effectiveness of its phonics component. As part of this requirement, the ED asked Dr. Marilyn J. Adams to produce a report on the role of phonics instruction in beginning reading. This resulted in her 1994 book &quot;Beginning to Read: Thinking and Learning about Print&quot;. In the book, Adams asserted that existing scientific research supported that phonics is an effective way to teach students the &quot;alphabetic code&quot; – building their skills in decoding unknown words. By learning the alphabetic code, she argued, students can free up mental energy used for word analysis and devote this mental effort to meaning, leading to stronger comprehension. Furthermore, she suggested that students be encouraged &quot;not&quot; to skip words they find difficult. Instead they should take the time to study the challenging words and to reread sentences after they have succeeded in decoding them. She also concluded that while phonics instruction is a necessary component of reading instruction, it is not sufficient by itself. Children should also have practice reading text provided they do not make too many mistakes. In spite of her study, the argument about how to teach reading eventually known as &quot;the Great Debate&quot;, continued unabated.

In 1996 the California Department of Education took an increased interest in using phonics in schools. And in 1997 the department called for grade one teaching in concepts about print, phonemic awareness, decoding and word recognition, and vocabulary and concept development.

In 1997, Congress asked the Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the National Institutes of Health, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, to convene a national panel to assess the effectiveness of different approaches used to teach children to read.

The National Research Council re-examined the question of how best to teach reading to children (among other questions in education) and in 1998 published the results in the &quot;Prevention of Reading Difficulties in Young Children.&quot; The National Research Council&#x27;s findings largely matched those of Adams. They concluded that phonics is a very effective way to teach children to read at the word level, more effective than what is known as the &quot;embedded phonics&quot; approach of whole language (where phonics was taught opportunistically in the context of literature). They found that phonics instruction must be systematic (following a sequence of increasingly challenging phonics patterns) and explicit (teaching students precisely how the patterns worked, e.g., &quot;this is &quot;b&quot;, it stands for the /b/ sound&quot;).

In 2000 the findings of the National Reading Panel was published. It examined quantitative research studies on many areas of reading instruction, including phonics and whole language. The resulting report &quot;Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and its Implications for Reading Instruction&quot; provides a comprehensive review of what is known about best practices in reading instruction in the U.S. The panel reported that several reading skills are critical to becoming good readers: phonemic awareness, phonics for word identification, fluency, vocabulary and text comprehension. With regard to phonics, their meta-analysis of hundreds of studies confirmed the findings of the National Research Council: teaching phonics (and related phonics skills, such as phonemic awareness) is a more effective way to teach children early reading skills than is embedded phonics or no phonics instruction. The panel found that phonics instruction is an effective method of teaching reading for students from kindergarten through 6th grade, and for all children who are having difficulty learning to read. They also found that phonics instruction benefits all ages in learning to spell. They also reported that teachers need more education about effective reading instruction, both pre-service and in-service.

The State driven Common Core State Standards Initiative was developed in 2009, because of a lack of standardization of education principles and practices. The site has a comprehensive description of the specific details of the English Language Arts Standards that include the areas of the Alphabetic Principle, Print Concepts, Phonological Awareness, Phonics and Word Recognition, and Fluency. It is up to the individual States and School Districts to develop plans to implement the standards. As of 2020, 41 States had adopted the standards, and in most cases it has taken three or more years to have them implemented. For example, Wisconsin adopted the standards in 2010, implemented them in the 2014–2015 school year, yet in 2020 the state Department of Public Instruction was in the process of developing materials to support the standards in teaching phonics.

The State of Mississippi passed the Literacy-Based Promotion Act in 2013 in part because of the States&#x27; poor showing in the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The Mississippi Department of Education provides resources for teachers in the areas of phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, comprehension and reading strategies. In 2019 Mississippi made a bigger advance in reading than any other State.

In 2014 the California Department of Education stated &quot;Ensuring that children know how to decode regularly spelled one-syllable words by mid-first grade is crucial&quot;. It goes on to say that &quot;Learners need to be phonemically aware (especially able to segment and blend phonemes)&quot;. In grades two and three children receive explicit instruction in advanced phonic-analysis and reading multi-syllabic and more complex words.

In 2015 the New York State Public School system began a process to revise its English Language Arts Learning Standards. The new standards call for teaching involving &quot;reading or literacy experiences&quot; as well as phonemic awareness from prekindergarten to grade 1 and phonics and word recognition from grade 1 to grade 4.

In 2015 the Ohio Legislature set minimum standards requiring the use of phonics as a technique in teaching reading. It includes guidelines for teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. In February 2017, the Ohio Department of Education adopted new learning standards for English Language Arts. They include &quot;Reading Standards for Foundational Skills K–12&quot; that clearly lay out a systematic approach to teaching &quot;phonological awareness&quot; in kindergarten and grade one, and &quot;grade-level phonics and word analysis skills in decoding words&quot; (including fluency and comprehension) in grades one through five.

In 2016 the What Works Clearinghouse and the Institute of Education Sciences, an independent and non-partisan arm of the U.S. Department of Education, published an Educator&#x27;s Practice Guide (with evidence) on Foundational Skills to Support Reading for Understanding in Kindergarten Through 3rd Grade. It contains four recommendations to support reading: 1) Teach students academic language skills, including the use of inferential and narrative language, and vocabulary knowledge, 2) Develop awareness of the segments of sounds in speech and how they link to letters (phonemic awareness and phonics), 3) Teach students to decode words, analyze word parts, and write and recognize words (phonics and synthetic phonics), and 4) Ensure that each student reads connected text every day to support reading accuracy, fluency, and comprehension. Some universities have created additional material based on this guide.

In 2016, Colorado Department of Education updated their Elementary Teacher Literacy Standards with a comprehensive outline including standards for development in the areas Phonology; Phonics and Word Recognition; Fluent Automatic Reading; Vocabulary; Text Comprehension; and Handwriting, Spelling, and Written Expression. At the same time, the Department of Education in Delaware produced a plan to improve education results. It states that teachers&#x27; preparation programs must include evidence-based practices, including the five essential components of reading instruction (phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension).

In 2017, research published in the &quot;Journal of Experimental Psychology&quot; has shown that learning to read by sounding out words (i.e. phonics) has a dramatic impact on the accuracy of reading aloud and comprehension. It concludes that early literacy education should focus on the systematic approach in &quot;print-to-sound relationships&quot; in alphabetic languages, rather than teaching &quot;meaning-based strategies&quot;, in order to enhance both reading aloud and comprehension of written words.

In 2018 The Association for Psychological Science published an article entitled &quot;Ending the Reading Wars: Reading Acquisition From Novice to Expert&quot;. The purpose of the article is to fill the gap between the current research knowledge and the public understanding about how we learn to read, and to explain &quot;why phonics instruction is so central to learning in a writing system such as English&quot;.

In 2018 the Arkansas Department of Education, Literacy Support Unit, published a report about their new initiative known as R.I.S.E., Reading Initiative for Student Excellence, that was the result of The Right to Read Act, passed in 2017. The first goal of this initiative is to provide educators with the in-depth knowledge and skills of &quot;the science of reading&quot; and evidence-based instructional strategies. This includes a change of focus to research-based instruction on phonological awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension. Specific requirements are that reading instruction be systematic and explicit, and include decoding techniques. Part of the instruction involves the use of a book and study guide entitled Essentials of Assessing, Preventing and Overcoming Reading Difficulties, by David Kilpatrick.

In 2018 the Minnesota Reading Corps (MRC) published impact evaluation reports of their reading programs for children in pre-kindergarten to grade three (2017–2018). MRC is a participating organization under Americorps in which volunteers tutor at-risk students who need extra support in reading and math. The tutors are trained to use research-based literacy activities and interventions as identified by the National Reading Panel, including phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The reports, presented by NORC at the University of Chicago, compare the results of students in the MRC program with students in control groups. They found that MRC kindergarten students achieved significantly higher scores in letter-sound fluency, and MRC first grade students achieved significantly higher scores in both nonsense word fluency and oral reading fluency.

In 2019 the Minnesota Department of Education introduced standards requiring school districts to &quot;develop a Local Literacy Plan to ensure that all students have achieved early reading proficiency by no later than the end of third grade&quot; in accordance with a Statute of the Minnesota Legislature requiring elementary teachers to be able to implement comprehensive, scientifically based reading and oral language instruction in the five reading areas of phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.

In 2019 the International Literacy Association released a report entitled Meeting the Challenges of Early Literacy Phonics Instruction The report clearly supports the use of phonics instruction that is explicit and systematic, stating that &quot;phonics instruction is helpful for all students, harmful for none, and crucial for some&quot;. It also offers an opinion on the ten most common causes of Phonics Instructional Failure, namely: inadequate time devoted to mastering a new phonics skill such as blending (4–6 weeks recommended); lack of application to real reading instruction; inappropriate reading material to practice the skills; too much teacher instruction, and too little reading by the student; lost time during instructional transitions; the teacher&#x27;s attitude and knowledge of phonics instructional material; lessons that are not fast-paced and rigorous; lack of assessments over an extended period of time; waiting too long to transition to multi-syllable words; and over-emphasis of phonics drills at the expense of other aspects such as vocabulary.

In 2019, the Best Evidence Encyclopedia, part of Johns Hopkins University, released a review of research on 61 studies of 48 different programs for struggling readers in elementary schools. It concluded that:
* Outcomes were positive for one-to-one tutoring
* Outcomes were positive but not as large for one-to-small group tutoring
* There were no differences in outcomes between teachers and teaching assistants as tutors
* Technology-supported adaptive instruction did not have positive outcomes
* Whole-class approaches (mostly cooperative learning) and whole-school approaches incorporating tutoring obtained outcomes for struggling readers as large as those found for one-to-one tutoring, and benefitted many more students
* Approaches mixing classroom and school improvements, with tutoring for the most at-risk students, have the greatest potential for the largest numbers of struggling readers

In 2019, 52.8% of Louisiana&#x27;s third-graders scored at or above the State&#x27;s reading benchmark. Also in 2019, 26% of grade 4 students were reading at a proficiency level according to the Nation&#x27;s Report Card. In that same year, the Louisiana State Legislature passed resolution 222 urging the Department of Education to create the &quot;Early Literacy Commission&quot; to make recommendations to implement a system providing effective evidence-based reading instruction for children from birth through third grade. On March 8, 2019, the Louisiana Department of Education revised their curriculum for K–12 English Language Arts. Its &quot;Reading Standards for Foundational Skills&quot; includes requirements for instruction in the alphabetic principle, phonological awareness, phonics and word recognition, fluency and comprehension. Effective in 2020 The Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) screens for the following skills: Kindergarten-Phonemic Awareness; First Grade-Phonics; Second Grade-Oral Reading Fluency; and Third Grade-Reading Comprehension.

In 2019, 30% of grade 4 students in Texas were reading at the &quot;proficiency level&quot; according to the Nation&#x27;s Report Card, as compared to the National Average of 34%. In June of that same year the Texas Legislature passed House Bill 3 (HB 3 Reading Academies) requiring all kindergarten through grade-three teachers and principals to &quot;&quot;begin&quot; a teacher literacy achievement academy before the 2022–2023 school year&quot;. The training is anticipated to be a total of 80 hours. The goal is to &quot;increase teacher knowledge and implementation of evidence-based practices to positively impact student literacy achievement&quot;. The required content of the academies&#x27; training includes the areas of &quot;Science of Teaching Reading, Oral Language, Phonological Awareness, Decoding (i.e. Phonics), Fluency and Comprehension.&quot;

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, the United States achieved the 15th highest score in Reading Literacy for students in their fourth year of school according to the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS). Of 78 countries, the United States ranked 14th in reading for the international PISA study for 15-year-old students. In 2019, with respect to the nation&#x27;s grade-four public school students, 34% performed at or above the Nations Report Card &quot;proficient level&quot; (solid academic performance) and 65% performed at or above the NAEP &quot;basic level&quot; (partial mastery of the proficient level skills).

In 2021, the State of Connecticut passed an act concerning the &quot;right to read&quot; that will take effect in 2023. It requires education standards that are evidenced-based and scientifically based and focused on competency in the five areas of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and reading fluency, including oral skills and reading comprehension. In the same year, the state of North Carolina passed a bill requiring that the teaching of reading be based on the science of reading.

Between 2013 and 2022, 30 States have passed laws or implemented new policies related to evidence-based reading instruction. In some instances, this requires the teaching of phonics in an explicit and systematic manner. However, these requirements are not uniform and may prove difficult to implement as &quot;old practices prove hard to shake&quot;.

In 2023, New York City set about to require schools to teach reading with an emphasis on phonics. In that city, less than half of the students from the third grade to the eighth grade of school scored as proficient on state reading exams. More than 63% of Black and Hispanic test-takers did not make the grade. Elementary school teachers will have to implement one of three comprehensive reading programs over the next couple of years. The United Federation of Teachers celebrated the announcement, but the local principals union was “not satisfied” with the lack of choice. All but two of the school superintendents chose the most traditional of the three choices, with explicit and systematic instruction in foundational literacy skills such as vocabulary and reading comprehension.

<text>Sex education, also known as sexual education, sexuality education or sex ed, is the instruction of issues relating to human sexuality, including human sexual anatomy, sexual activity, sexual reproduction, safe sex, birth control, sexual health, reproductive health, emotional relations, emotional responsibilities, age of consent, and reproductive rights.

Sex education that includes all of these issues is known as comprehensive sexuality education. In contrast, abstinence-only sex education, which focuses solely on promoting sexual abstinence, is often favored in more socially conservative regions, including some parts of the United States.

Sex education may be provided as part of school programs, public health campaigns, or by parents or caregivers. In some countries it is known as &quot;relationships and sexual health education&quot;.

Many governments see it as beneficial to provide public education on such matters prior to or at the beginning of puberty to improve public health, to limit the spread of sexually transmitted infections, and to avoid teenage pregnancy and unwanted pregnancies later on.

==History==

In many cultures, the discussion of all sexual issues has traditionally been considered taboo, and adolescents were not given any information on sexual matters. Such instruction, as was given, was traditionally left to a child&#x27;s parents, and often this was put off until just before their marriage. However, in the late 19th century, the progressive education movement led to the introduction of sex education as &quot;social hygiene&quot; in North American school curricula and the introduction of school-based sex education.

During the Second World War, UK governmental concerns grew around mass relocation, parentless youths, and young men and women working together for the first time. Not only were there fears of new sexually transmitted diseases, but there was also growing anxiety around young pregnancy putting pressure on the war-ravaged economy and healthcare system. As such, the UK Board for Education introduced the &quot;Sex Education in Schools and Youth Organizations&quot; guidance. This put the onus of sex education on schools and youth groups, and guided leaders on how to execute this. For example, the mechanics of sexual intercourse could be communicated via &quot;the keeping of livestock&quot;, as students could observe reproduction in real-time; the guidance also encouraged discussions about menstruation, motherhood courses, and personal hygiene talks. Popular among teachers and many parents, this guidance – which made sex education a possibility, not an obligation – prevailed for many years in the UK. In the 1970s, informational films became popular among teachers. Martin Cole&#x27;s &quot;Growing Up&quot; (1971) was a frank look at how sex works physiologically and socially. It showed real clips of penises and masturbation, which sparked some backlash. However, it became apparent in the 1980s that a frank and factual approach was required in sex education as the HIV/AIDS crisis began in the UK. In 1999, the Labour government introduced Sex and Relationships Education guidance, with particular focus on sexually transmitted diseases and teenage pregnancy. This was part of the ten-year Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, which would eventually resolve in 2010. Teenage pregnancy rates were halved across this period, however similar changes in other countries indicate that this was not an effect of the strategy.

After the Second World War, some developing countries promoted sex education programs that evolved to address political goals. A growing anxiety in some areas of the world over rising birth rates led to population-centered sex education programs. For instance, the first sex education curriculum in Singapore between 1966 and 1973 emphasized birth control as a way to avoid overpopulation. Reforms in some socialist countries focused on the role of sex education in strengthening family ties within society. This was the focus of sex education programs that developed in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and Cuba during the late twentieth century. The evolving content of sex education programs reflected shifting opinions regarding sexuality within each society. For example, Swedish sex education guidelines and textbooks published between 1945 and 2000 originally depicted masturbation as inherently harmful but increasingly portrayed it as natural and harmless. 

Globally, the outbreak of AIDS has given a new sense of urgency to sex education. In many African countries where AIDS is at epidemic levels (see HIV/AIDS in Africa) sex education is seen by most scientists as a vital public health strategy. Some international organizations such as Planned Parenthood consider that broad sex education programs have global benefits, such as controlling the risk of overpopulation and advancing women&#x27;s rights, including reproductive rights. The use of mass media campaigns has sometimes resulted in high levels of awareness coupled with essentially superficial knowledge of HIV transmission.

According to SIECUS, the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, 93% of adults they surveyed support sexuality education in high school and 84% support it in junior high school. In fact, 88% of the parents of junior high school students and 80% of parents of secondary school students believe that sex education in school makes it easier for them to talk to their adolescents about sex. Also, 92% of adolescents report that they want both to talk to their parents about sex and to have comprehensive in-school sex education. Furthermore, a &quot;study, conducted by Mathematica Policy Research on behalf of the US Department of Health and Human Services, found that abstinence-only-until-marriage programs are ineffective.&quot;

The current frontier in the development of relationship and sex education (RSE) is LGBTQ+ inclusion. The recent 2019 guidance update is tentative in its acknowledgement of LGBT people, something which has proved controversial among homo- and transphobic groups, as well as among LGBT allies and pro-inclusion sociologists. For example, while Birmingham primary schools were protested by Muslim parents opposing the introduction of LGBT content to the guidance, sociologist Jonathan Glazzard criticized the Department for Education for the document&#x27;s ambiguity and &quot;opt-out&quot; potential. The inclusion of this form of sex education is argued to make LGBT students feel more included, and that feelings of safety would foster healthy developmental outcomes for this group.

==Definitions==
Leepson sees sex education as instruction in various physiological, psychological and sociological aspects of sexual response and reproduction. Kearney (2008) also defined sex education as &quot;involving a comprehensive course of action by the school, calculated to bring about the socially desirable attitudes, practices and personal conduct on the part of children and adults, that will best protect the individual as a human and the family as a social institution.&quot; Thus, sex education may also be described as &quot;sexuality education&quot;, which means that it encompasses education about all aspects of sexuality, including information about family planning, reproduction (fertilization, conception and development of the embryo and fetus, through to childbirth), plus information about all aspects of one&#x27;s sexuality including: body image, sexual orientation, sexual pleasure, values, decision making, communication, dating, relationships, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and how to avoid them, and birth control methods. Various aspects of sex education are considered appropriate in school depending on the age of the students or what the children can comprehend at a particular point in time. Rubin and Kindendall expressed that sex education is not merely the topics of reproduction and teaching how babies are conceived and born. Instead, it has a far richer scope and goal of helping children incorporate sex more meaningfully into their present and future life and to provide them with some basic understanding of virtually every aspect of sex by the time they reach full maturity.

Sex education delivered via in-person classroom instruction and workshops led by teachers or trained sex educators is commonly referred to as &quot;school-based sex education&quot;.

==Evidence==
Evidence shows that a combination of comprehensive sexuality education and access to birth control appears to decrease the rates of unintended pregnancies among teenagers. A meta-analysis that compared comprehensive sexuality education programs with abstinence-only programs found that abstinence-only programs did not reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, but rather may have increased it. Numerous studies show that curricula providing accurate information about condoms and contraception can lead to reductions in the risky behaviors reported by young people as well as reductions in unintended pregnancies and STIs. Programs that teach only abstinence have not been shown to be effective.

According to UNFPA, &quot;A 2010 review found that &#x27;gender-focused&#x27; curricula – meaning curricula that integrate gender equality into the learning material – were substantially more effective in reducing risky behaviors than programs that did not consider gender.&quot; Research has also shown that delay in sexual initiation and the use of condoms and other contraception have been a result of young people adopting egalitarian attitudes towards gender roles. These individuals were also found to be less likely to engage in violent relationships and to have a lower rate of STIs (including HIV) and unintended pregnancy.

By emphasizing rights and gender issues, these programs help reduce gender-based violence and bullying, promote safe schools, empower young people to advocate for their own rights, and advance gender equality.

&quot;Few sexual health interventions are designed with input from adolescents. Adolescents have suggested that sex education should be more positive with less emphasis on anatomy and scare tactics; it should focus on negotiation skills in sexual relationships and communication; and details of sexual health clinics should be advertised in areas that adolescents frequent (for example, school toilets, shopping centers).&quot;

Also, a U.S. review concludes that &quot;the overwhelming weight of evidence shows that sex education that discusses contraception does not increase sexual activity&quot;. The 2007 study found that &quot;No comprehensive program hastened the initiation of sex or increased the frequency of sex, results that many people fear.&quot; Further, the report showed &quot;Comprehensive programs worked for both genders, for all major ethnic groups, for sexually inexperienced and experienced teens, in different settings, and in different communities.&quot;

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) recommends comprehensive sexuality education, as it enables young people to make informed decisions about their sexuality. According to UNFPA,It is taught over several years, introducing age-appropriate information consistent with the evolving capacities of young people. It includes scientifically accurate, curriculum-based information about human development, anatomy and pregnancy. It also includes information about contraception and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. And it goes beyond information, to encourage confidence and improved communication skills. Curricula should also address the social issues surrounding sexuality and reproduction, including cultural norms, family life and interpersonal relationships.When places have more comprehensive sexuality education, STI and pregnancy rates drop. The attitudes of children have also been found to differ depending on the content of their sex education. One comparison of results can be made between the sex education curriculum in the Netherlands and that in the US. On average teens in Europe and the Netherlands (which have more comprehensive sex ed) do not have sex at a younger age than teens in the US (with less comprehensive sex ed); however teens in the Netherlands report having a positive and consensual first sexual experience while 66% of sexually active US teens report that they wished they waited longer for their first sexual experience.

Nine out of ten teens in the Netherlands use contraception during their first sexual experience, which contributes to the lower pregnancy and STI rates. More comprehensive sex ed starting at the elementary level resulted in appreciation of sexual diversity, dating and intimate partner violence prevention, development of healthy relationships, prevention of child sex abuse, improved social/emotional learning, and increased media literacy.

Human rights issues, gender equality and gender roles should be integrated into every aspect of these discussions. This includes human rights protection, fulfillment and empowerment; the impact of gender discrimination; the importance of equality and gender-sensitivity; and the ideas underlying gender roles. Sexual abuse, gender-based violence and harmful practices should also be discussed. Taken together, all this information teaches young people the life skills necessary to assume responsibility for their own behavior and to respect the rights of others.&quot;

Comprehensive sexuality education &quot;enables young people to make informed decisions about their sexuality and health. These programs build life skills and increase responsible behaviors, and because they are based on human rights principles, they help advance human rights, gender equality and the empowerment of young people.&quot;

==Sources==

Sex education may be taught informally, such as when someone receives information from a conversation with a parent, friend, religious leader, or through the media. It may also be delivered through sex self-help authors, magazine advice columnists, sex columnists, or sexual education discussion board web sites. Sex education training for parents and educators can also be accessed on the internet through multimedia educational resources, including short videos, created by master sexuality educators. Adolescents spend a lot of their time on social media, or watching television. Those same adolescents may also have a hard time talking to their families about sexual matters. A study has shown that mass media interventions; for example, use of teaching sexual education through commercials shown on television, or ads on social media, have proven effective and decreased the amount of unprotected sex. Formal sex education occurs when schools or health care providers offer sex education. Slyer stated that sex education teaches the young person what he or she should know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others. Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.

Sometimes formal sex education is taught as a full course as part of the curriculum in junior high school or high school. Other times it is only one unit within a more broad biology, health, home economics, or physical education class. Some schools offer no sex education, since it remains a controversial issue in several countries, particularly the United States (especially with regard to the age at which children should start receiving such education, the amount of detail that is revealed, including LGBT sex education, and topics dealing with human sexual behavior, e.g. safe sex practices, masturbation, premarital sex, and sexual ethics).

Wilhelm Reich commented that sex education of his time was a work of deception, focusing on biology while concealing excitement-arousal, which is what a pubescent individual is mostly interested in. Reich added that this emphasis obscures what he believed to be a basic psychological principle: that all worries and difficulties originate from unsatisfied sexual impulses. Leepson asserted that the majority of people favor some sort of sex instruction in public schools, and this has become an intensely controversial issue because, unlike most subjects, sex education is concerned with an especially sensitive and highly personal part of human life. He suggested that sex education should be taught in the classroom.
The problem of pregnancy in adolescents is delicate and difficult to assess using sex education. But Calderone believed otherwise, stating that the answer to adolescents&#x27; sexual woes and pregnancy can not lie primarily in school programmes which at best can only be remedial; what is needed is prevention education and as such parents should be involved.

When sex education is contentiously debated, the chief controversial points are whether covering child sexuality is valuable or detrimental; whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into the curriculum; the use of birth control such as condoms and hormonal contraception; and the impact of such use on pregnancy outside marriage, teenage pregnancy, and the transmission of STIs. Increasing support for abstinence-only sex education by conservative groups has been one of the primary causes of this controversy. Countries with conservative attitudes towards sex education (including the UK and the U.S.) have a higher incidence of STIs and teenage pregnancy. On the other hand, it seems that in countries where sex education is not part of the curriculum, students show limited knowledge even in basic reproductive issues. For example, in a 2019 study with Greek students, it is reported that about two-thirds of the students failed to name external female genitals, such as the clitoris and labia, even after detailed pictures were provided to them.

==Public opinion==
A survey conducted in Britain, Canada and the United States by Angus Reid Public Opinion in November 2011 asked adult respondents to look back to the time when they were teenagers, and describe how useful several sources were in enabling them to learn more about sex. By far, the largest proportion of respondents in the three countries (74% in Canada, 67% in Britain and 63% in the United States) said that conversations with friends were &quot;very useful&quot; or &quot;moderately useful.&quot; The next reputable source was the media (television, books, movies, magazines), mentioned by three-in-five British (65%) and Canadians (62%) and more than half of Americans (54%) as useful.

In 2011, &quot;Angus Reid Public Opinion&quot; said that half of Canadians (54%) and Americans (52%) found their sex education courses at school to be useful, only 43% of Britons share the same view. And while more than half of Americans (57%) say conversations with family were useful, only 49% of Canadians and 35% of Britons said so.

==By area==

=== Africa ===
Sex education in Africa has focused on stemming the growing AIDS epidemic. Most governments in the region have established AIDS education programs in partnership with the World Health Organization and international NGOs. These programs were undercut significantly by the Mexico City policy, an initiative put in place by President Ronald Reagan, suspended by President Bill Clinton, and re-instated by President George W. Bush. The Global Gag Rule &quot;required nongovernmental organizations to agree as a condition of their receipt of Federal funds that such organizations would neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations...&quot; The policy was again suspended as one of the first official acts by United States President Barack Obama. New HIV infections in Uganda decreased dramatically when Clinton supported a comprehensive sexuality education approach (including information about contraception and abortion). According to Ugandan AIDS activists, the policy undermined community efforts to reduce HIV prevalence and HIV transmission.

Egypt teaches knowledge about male and female reproductive systems, sexual organs, contraception and STDs in public schools at the second and third years of the middle-preparatory phase (when students are aged 12–14). A coordinated program between UNDP, UNICEF, and the ministries of health and education promotes sexual education at a larger scale in rural areas and spreads awareness of the dangers of female genital mutilation.

=== Asia ===
The state of sex education programs in Asia is at various stages of development. The topic of sex education is considered to be very controversial because it deals with different topics which are sometimes too vague and too broad to be used effectively in society.

====Thailand====
In Thailand there has been progress on sex education, with the boundaries being pushed forward with each revision of the curriculum. The first national policy on sexuality education in schools was announced in 1938, but sex education was not taught in schools until 1978. It was then called &quot;Life and Family Studies&quot;, and its content consisted of issues related to the reproductive system and personal hygiene. The education curriculum has been revised several times, involving efforts from both government and non-government sectors, and sex education has been accepted as a problem solving tool for adolescent sexual reproduction and health issues. This has been a result of educational reform following the National Education Act B.E. 2542, increasing awareness of problems related to adolescents&#x27; sexual practices, and the emergence of women&#x27;s sexuality and queer movements. Another new approach in sexuality education curricula in Thailand has been the Teenpath Project developed by PATH, Thailand. PATH has also succeeded in institutionalizing sexuality education curricula in schools since 2003.

====India====
 Sex education in India remains a controversial subject due to conflicting religious, moral, and cultural beliefs regarding its place in adolescent and youth education. Sexual reproduction and different contraceptive methods are taught in grades 8 ,10 and 12 (ages 13-17) compulsorily as a part of the biology course and some urban schools do have seminars in the area of sex education. In 1993, the Adolescent Education Programme (AEP) was initiated by the Government of India which formalized the need for sex education, similarly included in the National Curriculum Framework in 2005. However, there was no consensus among states to make it compulsory, and dedicated comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) has not been mandated in any national school curricula. Some states in India have also banned or refused to implement sex education in their states, citing conflict with traditional Indian values.

In India, there are many in- and out-of-school programs promoting sex education, including information on reproduction, sexuality, gender, contraception, STIs, violence, etc. Once such example is the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK), which was launched in 2014 by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare regarding adolescent health programming in the country, including sexual and reproductive health. Non-profit organizations and other groups in the development sector primarily lead the delivery of out-of-school CSE programs. These organizations and collectives also work closely with relevant governmental ministries and multi-lateral institutions (like UNESCO and WHO) to engage in public advocacy and policy change around acceptance and implementation of sex education. 

The AIDS prevalence rate in India is lower than that of many other countries, despite being home to the world&#x27;s third-largest population of persons with HIV/AIDS (as of 2023, with South Africa and Nigeria having more). However, AIDS clinics are not universally available and accessible in across different geographic regions in the country.

==== China ====
In 2000, a new five-year project was introduced by the China Family Planning Association to &quot;promote reproductive health education among Chinese teenagers and unmarried youth&quot; in twelve urban districts and three counties. This included discussion about sex within human relationships as well as pregnancy and HIV prevention. Since the 2010s there has been a great increase in books about sex education for children and young adults.

There is demand for sex education that is concentrated on social media platforms such as Weibo, citing the need to have sex education for its people to learn how to protect themselves against sexual related abuse and harassments. China currently still experiences sexual illiteracy. China&#x27;s government has passed a law that mandates &quot;age-appropriate sex education&quot; in October, 2020, but no outlines have been created yet to clarify how the mandate would be implemented in school.

Most recently, China has introduced a new sexual education for students named the &#x27;Healthy China Initiatives (2019–2030)&#x27;. The initiative came after a 2015 study by the China Family Planning Association conducted a study that showed only 10% of approximately 20,000 universities reported that they were not content with their sexual education in grade school and were unknowledgeable to violence, gender, contraceptives, sexually transmitted diseases, and pregnancy among other topics. The initiative is said to help provide students with knowledge of gender, sexuality, equality, consent, and rights.

==== South Korea ====
In South Korea, sex education began in some schools in the 1960s, and has been officially taught in public schools since 1984. A 2007 revision to the School Health Act made health education a mandatory subject in all grade schools, within which topics regarding gender equality, safe sex practices, and sexual ethics were included. Currently, all primary and secondary schools are required to include at least 15 hours of sex education in every school year, though 12 hours can be replaced with other subjects using each school&#x27;s discretion.

According to a 2020 study, 81% of primary school students reported receiving sex education. Sex education was reportedly superficial and focused mostly on biological topics, such as bodily changes during puberty, the process of reproduction, the anatomy of the reproductive system, and menstruation. Contraception and prevention of sexual violence were also covered. Most of the participants in the study were unsatisfied with the current state of sex education, and believed it was ineffective.

Sex education in schools has been subject to controversy, and has drawn criticisms from both conservative and feminist groups. A standardized guideline on sex education published by the Ministry of Education in 2015 was later withdrawn after being criticized for &quot;poor quality&quot;. Some Christian associations and parent groups have protested against in-depth sex education, specifically regarding reproductive rights and homosexuality. In one case, a demonstration on the correct use of a condom at a school was suspended due to complaints. The South Korean government has censored books regarding sex education due to pressure from conservative and parent groups. MBC reported that 67 out of 68 censored sex education books were &quot;harmless&quot;, however.

Some South Korean parents, who want to properly educate their children about sex, rely on private education for sex education because of unsatisfactory sex education in schools.

==== Other countries ====
Indonesia, Mongolia have a systematic policy framework for teaching about sex within schools. Malaysia and Thailand have assessed adolescent reproductive health needs with a view to developing adolescent-specific training, messages and materials.

Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Pakistan have no coordinated sex education programs.

In most Islamic countries, sex education is given after marriage to the couple.

In Nepal, sex education is mandatory in school.

In Japan, sex education is mandatory from age 10 or 11, mainly covering biological topics such as menstruation and ejaculation.

In Sri Lanka, sex education traditionally consisted of reading the reproduction section of biology textbooks. Young people are taught when they are 12 years old.

The International Planned Parenthood Federation and the BBC World Service ran a 12-part series known as &quot;Sexwise&quot;, which discussed sex education, family life education, contraception and parenting. It was first launched in South Asia and then extended worldwide.

In Taiwan, compared to China&#x27;s progress, has been a lot more progressive in implementing sex education. However, the controversy lies more in anti-gay groups who argue that including same-sex relationships in sex education is morally controversial, despite being the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage. Therefore, while sex education is required in school, LGBTQ topics have been rejected by many parents in the society, which potentially violates gender equity education in school. From the &quot;Journal of Modern Education Review,&quot; Taiwan has committed to achieving gender equity since 2004 with its Gender Equity Education Act (Taiwan) (GEEA), which includes curriculum, material, and activities to be practiced and taught in elementary and middle school. But also as a relatively conservative Asian country and culture, Taiwan has not yet been up to par with international standards, but seemingly on its way towards more progressive sex education.

==== Singapore ====
The Singapore Family Planning Association has developed a series of sex education programs for young people, focusing on strict control of sexual behavior and age. The Singapore government attaches great importance to the moral education of young people, and the sentencing of sexual offenses is very strict.

===Europe===
The World Health Organization and the German Federal Office of Health Education recommend sex education for children of all ages.

====Finland====
In Finland, sexual education is usually incorporated into various compulsory courses, mainly as part of biology lessons (in lower grades) and later in a course related to general health issues.

====France====
In France, sex education has been part of school curricula since 1973, though optional. Schools are expected to provide 30 to 40 hours of sex education, and pass out condoms, to students in grades 8 and 9 (aged 14). In January 2000, the French government launched an information campaign on contraception with TV and radio spots and the distribution of five million leaflets on contraception to high school students.
In September 2013, the government launched a new program called (&#x27;the ABCD of equality&#x27;) whose main aim is to &quot;fight gender stereotypes at school&quot;. The ultimate goal is to foster mutual respect between boys and girls early on so that it impacts their conception of the world later on.

====Germany====
The first state-sponsored courses on sex education were introduced in Breslau, Prussia, c. 1900 by Dr. Martin Chotzen.

In Germany, sex education has been part of school curricula since 1970. Since 1992 sex education is a governmental duty by law.

It normally covers all subjects concerning the process of growing up, bodily changes during puberty, emotions involved, the biological process of reproduction, sexual activity, partnership, homosexuality, unwanted pregnancies and the complications of abortion, the dangers of sexual violence, child abuse, and sex-transmitted diseases. It is comprehensive enough that it sometimes also includes things in its curricula such as sex positions. Most schools offer courses on the correct usage of contraception.

A sex survey by the World Health Organization concerning the habits of European teenagers in 2006 revealed that German teenagers care about contraception. The birth rate among 15- to 19-year-olds was very low—only 11.7 per 1000 people, compared to 27.8 births per 1,000 people in the UK, and 39.0 births per 1,000 people in Bulgaria (which, incidentally, has the highest birth rate in Europe).

German Constitutional Court and later, in 2011, the European Court of Human Rights, rejected complaints from several Baptists against Germany concerning mandatory sex education.

==== Greece ====
A 2022 analysis reported that human reproduction is mentioned in six out of 113 Greek secondary education textbooks used in biology classes from 1870s to present.

====Poland====
At the time of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, since 1973, sex education was one of the school subjects; however, it was relatively poor and did not achieve any actual success. After 1989, it practically vanished from the school life—it is currently a subject called &quot;family life education&quot; () rather than &quot;sex education&quot; ()—and schools explicitly require parental consent for their children to attend sex education classes. This policy is largely due to the strong objection against sex education raised by the Catholic Church.

====Portugal====
Some sex education is taught as part of biology-related curricula. There is also an official program intended to provide sex education for students.

====Netherlands====
Subsidized by the Dutch government, the &quot;Long Live Love&quot; package (), developed in the late 1980s, aims to give teenagers the skills to make their own decisions regarding health and sexuality. Nearly all secondary schools provide sex education, as part of biology classes and over half of primary schools discuss sexuality and contraception. Starting the 2012 school year, age-appropriate sex education—including education about sexual diversity —has been compulsory in all secondary and primary schools. The curriculum focuses on biological aspects of reproduction as well as on values, attitudes, communication and negotiation skills. Dutch sex education encourages the idea that topics like masturbation, homosexuality, and sexual pleasure are normal or natural and that there are larger emotional, relational, and societal forces that shape the experiences of sexuality. This type of curriculum can begin for students as young as at age four. The curriculum for children focuses on topics like love, self-image, and gender stereotypes. All elementary level students in the Netherlands are required by law to receive some level of sex education. There is some flexibility in how the subject is taught however there are some required principles such as sexual diversity and sexual assertiveness. Moreover, according to Amy Schalet, Dutch parents tend to form close relationships with their children, openly discussing teen sexuality. Dutch parents try to accept their children&#x27;s romantic relationships and even allow sleepovers, expecting them to have sex. The media has encouraged open dialogue and the health-care system guarantees confidentiality and a non-judgmental approach. The Netherlands has one of the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in the world, and the Dutch approach is often seen as a model for other countries.

====Slovakia====
In Slovakia the content of sex education varies from school to school, most frequently as a segment of a larger lesson plan of a subject akin to nature science in English (this course covers both biology and petrology). Generally the sex ed content taught in Slovakia is quite basic, sometimes lacking, though exactly what any given lesson contains varies among schools and is dependent on the teacher&#x27;s knowledge of the subject. It is not uncommon for teachers to rely on students asking questions (as opposed to documentaries, discussions, textbooks and in-class debates). Classes are usually divided into boys and girls. Boys are taught the basics of sex, usually limited to dialogue between student and teacher of annotated diagrams of genitalia; while girls are additionally taught about menstruation and pregnancy.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, sex education was established in 1921 for secondary education and in 1942 for all grades. The subject is usually started in kindergarten and continues cumulatively throughout the student&#x27;s entire schooling. This sexual education is incorporated into different subjects such as biology and history. The Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU) has a sex education that emphasizes &quot;sexual diversity, freedom and enjoyment&quot;, and the RFSU collaborate frequently with government organizations such as the National Institute of Public Health. Alongside this emphasis of sexual diversity, Swedish sex education has equal incorporations of lesbian and gay sexuality as well as heterosexual sexuality. They provide knowledge about masturbation, oral and anal sex as well as heterosexual, genital intercourse.

====Switzerland====
In Switzerland, the content and amount of sex education is decided at the cantonal level. In Geneva, courses have been given at the secondary level first for girls since 1926 and compulsory programs have been implemented at secondary level for all classes since the 1950s. In most French-speaking cantons since the 1970s, generalized courses have been implemented by states with duly formed and trained specialists working within school health services at the secondary level.

Interventions in primary schools were started during the 1980s, with the basic objective of empowering children, strengthening their resources, and giving the capacity to discriminate what is right or wrong based upon what is and is not allowed by law and society. They are also given knowledge of their own rights, told that they can have their own feelings about themselves, and informed on whom to talk to in case they feel uncomfortable about a private matter and wish to talk about it.

Finally, the objectives include an enforcement of their capacity to decide for themselves and their ability to express their feelings about a situation and say &quot;no&quot;. In secondary schools, there are programs at ages 13–14 and 16–17 with the basic objective to give students a secure moment with caring, well-informed adults. With confidentiality and mutual respect, students can talk to an adult who understands youth needs and what they should know about sexual life in conformity with age and maturity.

In the German part of the country, the situation is somewhat different. Sex education as a school implemented program is a fairly recent subject, the responsibility given to school teachers. Though federal structures give authority to each state to decide, there are efforts, notably under the auspices of – the Swiss branch of IPPF (International Planned Parenthood Federation) – to look for and propose possible models of application which take into account all factors of sex education according to their different levels of concern, parents, teachers, and external experts.

====United Kingdom====
=====England and Wales=====
Cecil Reddie ran the first sex education course at a British school in October 1889 at Abbotsholme School but the lessons were only for sex between married couples.

In England and Wales, Sex and relationships education (SRE) is compulsory since 1976, in part, from age 11 onwards. It involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality and sexual health. It does not promote early sexual activity or any particular sexual orientation. The compulsory parts of sex and relationships education are the elements contained within the national curriculum for science. Parents can currently withdraw their children from all other parts of sex and relationships education if they want.

The compulsory curriculum focuses on the reproductive system, fetal development, and the physical and emotional changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionary and discussion about relationships is often neglected. Britain has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe However, these have halved across England and Wales in recent years and continue to fall

Some schools actively choose to deliver age appropriate relationship and sex education from Early Years Foundation Stage, which include the differences between boys and girls, naming body parts, what areas of the body are private and should not be touched unless the child is happy and gives consent.

Following sustained political pressure, in March 2017 it was announced by the Department for Education (DfE) that from September 2019, Relationship Education (RE) in primary schools and Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) in secondary schools would be made mandatory in England by the UK government. The existing category of SRE (Sex and Relationships Education) is now referred to as RSE (Relationship and Sex Education) by the British government.

Since September 2020, all primary age schoolchildren and up in England are taught Relationships and Health Education. Relationships education includes the follow topics: families and people who care for me; caring friendships; respectful relationships; online relationships; and being safe. By the end of primary school, pupils have also learned the following from their health education: mental wellbeing; internet safety and harms; physical health and fitness; healthy eating; facts and risks associated with drugs, alcohol and tobacco; health and prevention; basic first aid; and the changing adolescent body. At secondary school, pupils&#x27; understanding of health is developed with an increased focus on areas like drugs, alcohol, intimate relationships and sex, and how to have positive and health sexual relationships.

Students cannot be withdrawn from Relationships Education, but they can be withdrawn by their parents from the sexual health part of the curriculum if the headteacher grants this request. Schools must respect the parents&#x27; request to withdraw their child up to and until three terms before the child turns 16. If the child wishes to receive sex education after this point, the school is expected to make arrangements to offer it.

=====Scotland=====
The main sex education program in Scotland is &quot;Healthy Respect&quot;, which focuses not only on the biological aspects of reproduction but also on relationships and emotions. Education about contraception and sexually transmitted diseases are included in the program as a way of encouraging good sexual health. In response to a refusal by Catholic schools to commit to the program , however, a separate sex education program has been developed for use in those schools. Funded by the Scottish Government, the program &quot;Called to Love&quot; focuses on encouraging children to delay sex until marriage, and does not cover contraception, and as such is a form of abstinence-only sex education.

As education is a provincial concern, sex education varies across Canada. Ontario has a provincial curriculum created in 1998. Attempting to update it has proven controversial: a first reform was shelved in 2010 and a new curriculum introduced in 2015 by the Liberal government under Kathleen Wynne was reversed three years later by the Conservatives under Doug Ford, inviting parents to file complaints against teachers who will not comply with the change. Mandatory sex education was removed from the Quebec provincial curriculum in 2005, leaving it at the discretion of each teacher. With rates of syphilis and gonorrhea rising in the province since this change, several researchers and sex educators are criticizing the current policy, most notably Lisa Trimble and Stephanie Mitelman. It was brought back as a facultative subject in 2016–2017, then mandatory for the 2017–2018 school year.

====United States====
Almost all U.S. public students receive some form of sex education at least once between grades 7 and 12; many public schools begin addressing some topics in grades 5 or 6. However, what students learn varies widely, because curriculum decisions are decentralized. Many states have laws governing what is taught in sex education classes and contain provisions to allow parents to opt out. Some state laws leave curriculum decisions to individual school districts. 

In January 2022, a study found that a majority of US teens lack quality sexual education, a trend that has been worsening over years. Instruction on waiting until marriage to have sex declined from 73% to 67% among females (&quot;P&quot; = 0.005) and from 70% to 58% in males (&quot;P&quot; &lt; 0.001).

Sex education is required in 30 states, 28 of which also require HIV education. 9 more states require just HIV education. Only 18 states require the information taught to be medically accurate by law. 37 states allow parents to opt their kids out of their Sex Ed. 19 states require instruction that sexual activity should only occur in marriage and 28 states require that abstinence be stressed. Contextually, 11 states must inclusively discuss sexual orientation and 5 legally must emphasize heterosexuality or provide negative information about homosexuality. A total of 6 states require LGBTQ+-inclusive sex education to be taught in school. Only 9 states require the importance of consent in a sexual situation.

For example, a 1999 study by the Guttmacher Institute found that most U.S. sex education courses in grades 7 through 12 cover puberty, HIV, STIs, abstinence, implications of teenage pregnancy, and how to resist peer pressure. Other studied topics, such as methods of birth control and infection prevention, sexual orientation, sexual abuse, and factual and ethical information about abortion, varied more widely.

Within the last decade, the US federal government has encouraged abstinence-only education by steering over a billion dollars to such programs. Some 25 states now decline the funding so that they can continue to teach comprehensive sexuality education. Funding for one of the federal government&#x27;s two main abstinence-only funding programs, &quot;Title V&quot;, was extended only until December 31, 2007; Congress debated whether to continue it past that date. In 2007, a study ordered by the U.S. Congress found that middle school students who took part in abstinence-only sex education programs were just as likely to have sex (and use contraception) in their teenage years as those who did not. Abstinence-only advocates claimed that the study was flawed because it was too narrow and began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and that other studies have demonstrated positive effects.

Proponents of comprehensive sexuality education, which include the American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, and the American College Health Association, argue that sexual behavior after puberty is a given, and it is therefore crucial to provide information about the risks and how they can be minimized; they also claim that denying teens such factual information leads to STIs and unwanted pregnancies.

A 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report showed a 3% increase in teenage pregnancies from 2005 to 2006, to nearly 42 births per 1,000. Apart from this, the rate of teen pregnancy has been declining consistently since 1991. Still, the U.S. has the highest teen birth rate and one of the highest rates of STIs among teens in the industrialized world.

====Australia====
The Government of Victoria (Australia) developed a policy for the promotion of &quot;Health and Human Relations Education&quot; in schools in 1980 that was introduced into the State&#x27;s primary and secondary schools during 1981. The initiative was developed and implemented by the Honorable Norman Lacy MP, Minister for Educational Services from 1979 to 1982.

A &quot;Consultative Council for Health and Human Relations Education&quot; was established in December 1980 under the chairmanship of Dame Margaret Blackwood; its members possessed considerable expertise in the area.

The council had three major functions:
# to advise and to be consulted on all aspects of Health and Human Relations&#x27; Education in schools;
# to develop, for consideration of the Government, appropriate curriculum for schools;
# to advise and recommend the standards for in-service courses for teachers and relevant members of the school community.

Support services for the Consultative Council were provided by a new Health and Human Relations Unit within the Special Services Division of the Education Department of Victoria and was responsible for the implementation of the Government&#x27;s policy and guidelines in this area. The Unit advised principals, school councils, teachers, parents, tertiary institutions and others in all aspects of &quot;Health and Human Relations Education&quot;.

In 1981 the Consultative Council recommended the adoption of a set of guidelines for the provision of &quot;Health and Human Relations Education&quot; in schools as well as a Curriculum Statement to assist schools in the development of their programs. These were presented to the Victorian Cabinet in December 1981 and adopted as government policy.

As of March 2021, a program called &quot;Respectful Relationships&quot; was a core part of Victoria&#x27;s curriculum, and was to become mandatory in all state schools. Students will also be specifically taught about consent.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, sexuality education is part of the Health and Physical Education curriculum, which is compulsory for the first ten years of schooling (Years 1 to 10) but optional beyond that. Sexual and reproductive health education begins at Year 7 (approximately age 11), although broader issues such as physical, emotional and social development, personal and interpersonal skills, and (non-sexual) relationships begin as early as Year 1 (approximately age 5).

The Health/ curriculum, including the sexuality education component, is the only part of the New Zealand Curriculum/ (the former for English-medium schools, the latter for Māori-medium schools) in which state and state-integrated schools must legally consult with the school community regarding its delivery, and the consultations must occur at least once every two years. Parents can ask for their children to be removed from the sexuality education component of the health curriculum for any reason, provided they apply in writing to the school principal, and do so at least 24 hours beforehand so alternative arrangements can be made. However, this does not prevent a teacher answering sexuality education questions if a student, excluded or not, asks them.

== Opposing sides regarding the ethics of sexuality ==
There are two opposing sides of the sex education argument among parents. Sexual liberals see knowledge on sex as equipping individuals to make informed decisions about their personal sexuality, and they are in favor of comprehensive sexual education all throughout schooling, not just in high school. Sexual conservatives see extensive education on sex as encouraging adolescents to have sex, and they believe that sex education should be taught inside the family for morals to be included in the conversation. Sexual conservatives see the importance of teaching sex education, but only through abstinence-only programs.

Some claim that certain sex education curricula break down pre-existing notions of modesty or encourage acceptance of what they consider immoral practices, such as homosexuality or premarital sex. Naturally, those that believe that homosexuality and premarital sex are a normal part of the range of human sexuality disagree with them.

Many religions teach that sexual behavior outside of marriage is immoral and/or psychologically damaging, and many adherents desire this morality to be taught as a part of sex education. They may believe that sexual knowledge is necessary, or simply unavoidable, hence their preference for curricula based on abstinence.

== Sexual Health Website Evaluation Studies ==
Research conducted in the 2010–20 shows the effectiveness of digital sexual health interventions for young adults. The systematic literature review examined 9881 records and assessed 61 studies, showing that phones are the leading way to deliver cognitive and behavioral results related to sexual health. Tools identified as the most popular mechanisms for sexual health promotion were: interactive websites, text messaging, phone calls, and online education programs. In evaluating the impact of these interventions, the review highlighted the importance of robust research designs, such as randomized controlled trials.

The reliability of the information on Sexual Health remains a concern. A study focusing on websites that adolescents tend to access when seeking online sexual health information revealed the differences in reliability of those online resources. The study focused on websites based in the US such as: Planned Parenthood and WebMD. While Planned Parenthood was found to be the most well-rounded website, concerns about the reliability of some websites remain.

Another study focused on the quality of online sexual health resources accessed by young people. It found that the CDC had the highest reliability score, while Planned Parenthood and WebMD scored higher in usability.

Both these studies highlight the importance of online resources promoting sexual health in being easily accessible and trustworthy. 

A study examined the accessibility of sex education content online. The research was a keyword search which resulted in identifying 41 relevant web pages. A surprising finding was that 63% of the pages were classified as pornography. This study highlights the difficulties and challenges that surround sexual health website evaluation studies.

==LGBT sex education==

One major source of controversy in the realm of sex education is whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into school curricula. LGBT sex education includes inclusive teaching of safe sex practices for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals and general instruction in topics related to sexual orientation and gender identity. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today. Five states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. Only 20% of LGBT students have heard anything positive about their community and they reported in a 2011 Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) report that they were more likely to hear positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class. Six states (California, Colorado, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington) enforce sex education curricula that includes LGBT information beginning 2020. Beyond states, the District of Columbia has also moved to offer curricula that supports the involvement of LGBT sexual education. Beneficial factors have shown to include lowered rates of depression and suicide, tentative approaches to sexual behaviors, and intimidation from peers.

=== Pro-LGBT ===

Proponents of LGBT sex education argue that encompassing homosexuality into the curricula would provide LGBT students with the sexual health information they need, and help to ameliorate problems such as low self-esteem and depression that research has shown can be present in LGBT individuals. They also claim that it could reduce homophobic bullying.

An example of LGBT-inclusive curriculum is introduced by the National Sexuality Education Standards set forth by the Future of Sex Education Initiative. These education standards outline seven core topics that must be addressed in sex education; one of those core topics is identity. The identity topic presents lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities as possibilities for students as they progress through life and come to understand who they are. These standards, the Future of Sex Education argues, will start in kindergarten and will evolve into more complex topics throughout schooling as the students mature and age. In the UK, BigTalk Education&#x27;s Growing Up Safe program , which includes LGBT relationship education from Primary School age, was awarded the 2017 Pamela Sheridan award for innovation and good practice in relationships and sex education (RSE), services and projects for young people.

=== Anti-LGBT ===

Opponents often argue that teaching LGBT sex education would be disrespectful to some religions and expose students to inappropriate topics. They say that including homosexuality in the curriculum would violate parents&#x27; rights to control what their children are exposed to and that schools should not inflict a particular political view on students. Currently, many sex education curricula do not include LGBT topics, and research has reported that students often feel that they do not receive adequate instruction in LGBT sex topics.

=== Parental rights in education ===
Recently, some states have opted to restrict topics about LGBT matter and people. One of the most controversial laws passed has been labeled the &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Gay&quot; law that has most recently been passed in Florida. The bill seeks to ban gender and sexuality issues being presented to students while in lower grade school in efforts to allow parents to make the decision as to when or if they will introduce their child to Gender and Sexuality subject matter.

<text>Pankisi () or the Pankisi Gorge (, &quot;Pankisis Kheoba&quot;) is a valley region in Georgia, in the upper reaches of River Alazani just south of Georgia’s historic region of Tusheti between Mt Borbalo and the ruined 17th-century fortress of Bakhtrioni. Administratively, it is included in the Akhmeta municipality of the Kakheti region. An ethnic group called Kists of Chechen roots form the majority (75%) in the area.

== History ==
17th century geographer and historian prince Vakhushti Bagrationi in his book &quot;Description of Kingdom of Georgia&quot; writes that the inhabitants of Pankisi are Georgian nobility with titles of Aznauri and Tavadi who have buildings near the mountains. He also writes: &quot;The village of Pankisi has vineyards, fruits and gardens, and mountain foods, like the places of mountains. Fish - trout, the forest is full of animals, land fertile for the grain, also for rice and cotton. A lots of cattle and a lot of pigs.&quot;

In the legislative acts of Georgian law of the 18th century, the noble (Aznauri) Kobiashvili family of the Kingdom of Kakheti are mentioned as the lords of the Pankisi valley.

According to sources, in 1730s, the Pankisi valley was emptied of Georgian population: part of them were killed as a result of the invasions, and rest of them resettled elsewhere.

== Etymology ==
According to Mate Albutashvili (also known as Kisti Chobani) toponym Pankisi is of Georgian origin, according to him, Pankisi derives from Pantisi which means land rich in wild forest pears (P’ant’a-პანტა) (pyrus caucasica) with Georgian suffix -სი(si).

==Political situation==
It had allegedly often been used as a base for transit, training and shipments of arms and financing by Chechen rebels and Islamic militants, including foreign fighters, many of whom followed Ruslan Gelayev. Most of these accusations were around 2002, but others allege that it is more peaceful now, although there are still many Chechen refugees living there.

The former senior Islamic State leader Tarkan Batirashvili, otherwise known as &quot;Omar the Chechen&quot;, grew up in the area where some of his family still lives. In 2014, Batirashvilii reportedly threatened to return to the area to lead a Muslim attack on Russian Chechnya. However, such a threat never came into fruition as he was killed during a battle in the town of Al-Shirqat in Iraq of 2016.

==Cultural references==
The situation in the Pankisi Gorge received an extensive fictional treatment factoring into several of the popular John Ringo anti-terrorism military science fiction books in the &quot;Paladin of Shadows&quot; series.

<doc id="42345" wikidata="Q541637" url="?curid=42345" title="Hyman G. Rickover">
<text>Hyman G. Rickover (27 January 1900 – 8 July 1986) was an admiral in the United States Navy. He directed the original development of naval nuclear propulsion and controlled its operations for three decades as director of the U.S. Naval Reactors office. In addition, he oversaw the development of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station, the world&#x27;s first commercial pressurized water reactor used for generating electricity. Rickover is also one of seven people who have been awarded two Congressional Gold Medals.

Rickover is known as the &quot;Father of the Nuclear Navy,&quot; and his influence on the Navy and its warships was of such scope that he &quot;may well go down in history as one of the Navy&#x27;s most important officers.&quot; He served in a flag rank for nearly 30 years (1953 to 1982), ending his career as a four-star admiral. His years of service exceeded that of each of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s five-star fleet admirals—Leahy, King, Nimitz and Halsey—all of whom served on active duty for life after their appointments. Rickover&#x27;s total of 63 years of active duty service makes him the longest-serving naval officer, as well as the longest-serving member of the U.S armed forces in history.

Having become a naval engineering duty officer (EDO) in 1937 after serving as both a surface ship and submarine-qualified unrestricted line officer, his substantial legacy of technical achievements includes the United States Navy&#x27;s continuing record of zero reactor accidents.

==Early life and education==
Rickover was born Chaim Gdala Rykower to Abraham and Rachel/Ruchla Lea (nee Unger) Rykower, a Polish Jewish family from Maków Mazowiecki in Vistula Land. His parents changed his name to &quot;Hyman&quot; which is derived from Chayyim, meaning &quot;life&quot;. He did not use his middle name Godalia (a form of &quot;Gedaliah&quot;), but he substituted &quot;George&quot; when at the Naval Academy.

In 1906 (aged six), Rickover made passage to New York City with his mother and sister, fleeing anti-Semitic Russian pogroms during the Revolution of 1905. They joined Abraham, who had made earlier trips there beginning in 1897 to become established. Rickover&#x27;s family lived initially on the East Side of Manhattan but moved two years later to North Lawndale, Chicago, which was a heavily Jewish neighborhood at the time, where Rickover&#x27;s father continued work as a tailor. Rickover took his first paid job at age nine, earning three cents an hour () for holding a light as his neighbor operated a machine. Later, he delivered groceries. He graduated from grammar school at 14.

Rickover attended John Marshall Metropolitan High School in Chicago and graduated with honors in 1918. He then held a full-time job as a telegraph boy delivering Western Union telegrams, through which he became acquainted with Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, a Czech Jewish immigrant. Sabath nominated Rickover for appointment to the United States Naval Academy. Rickover was only a third alternate for appointment, but he passed the entrance exam and was accepted.

== Naval career through World War II ==
Rickover&#x27;s naval career began in 1918 at the Naval Academy; at this time, attending military academies was considered active duty service, due in part to World War I. On 2 June 1922, Rickover graduated 107th out of 540 midshipmen and was commissioned as an ensign. He joined the destroyer on 5 September 1922. Rickover impressed his commanding officer with his hard work and efficiency, and was made engineer officer on 21 June 1923, becoming the youngest such officer in the squadron.

He next served on board the battleship before earning a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University in 1930 by way of a year at the Naval Postgraduate School and further coursework at Columbia. At the latter institution, he met Ruth D. Masters, a graduate student in international law, whom he married in 1931 after she returned from her doctoral studies at the Sorbonne in Paris. Shortly after marrying, Rickover wrote to his parents of his decision to become an Episcopalian, remaining so for the remainder of his life.

Rickover had a high regard for the quality of the education he received at Columbia, as demonstrated in this excerpt from a speech he gave at the university some 52 years after attending:

Columbia was the first institution that encouraged me to think rather than memorize. My teachers were notable in that many had gained practical engineering experience outside the university and were able to share their experience with their students. I am grateful, among others, to Professors Morecroft, Hehre, and Arendt. Much of what I have subsequently learned and accomplished in engineering is based on the solid foundation of principles I learned from them.

Rickover preferred life on smaller ships, and he also knew that young officers in the submarine service were advancing quickly, so he went to Washington and volunteered for submarine duty. His application was turned down due to his age, at that time 29 years. Fortunately for Rickover, he encountered his former commanding officer from &quot;Nevada&quot; while leaving the building, who interceded successfully on his behalf. From 1929 to 1933, Rickover qualified for submarine duty and command aboard the submarines and . While aboard S-48 he was addressed a letter of commendation from the Secretary of the Navy &quot;for rescuing Augustin Pasis… from drowning at the Submarine Base, Coco Solo, Canal Zone.&quot; While at the Office of the Inspector of Naval Material in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1933, Rickover translated &quot;Das Unterseeboot&quot; (&quot;The Submarine&quot;) by World War I German Imperial Navy Admiral Hermann Bauer. Rickover&#x27;s translation became a basic text for the U.S. submarine service.

On 17 July 1937, he reported aboard the minesweeper at Qingdao, China, and assumed what would be his only ship command with additional duty as Commander, Mine Division Three, Asiatic Fleet. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident had occurred ten days earlier. In August, &quot;Finch&quot; stood out for Shanghai to protect American citizens and interests from the conflict between Chinese and Japanese forces. On 25 September, Rickover was promoted to lieutenant commander, retroactive to 1 July. In October, his designation as an engineering duty officer became effective, and he was relieved of his three-month command of &quot;Finch&quot; at Shanghai on 5 October 1937.

Rickover was assigned to the Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines, and was transferred shortly thereafter to the Bureau of Engineering in Washington, D.C. Once there, he took up his duties as assistant chief of the Electrical section of the Bureau of Engineering on 15 August 1939.

On 10 April 1942, after America&#x27;s entry into World War II, Rickover flew to Pearl Harbor to organize repairs to the electrical power plant of . Rickover had been promoted to the rank of commander on 1 January 1942, and in late June of that year was made a temporary captain. In late 1944 he appealed for a transfer to an active command. He was sent to investigate inefficiencies at the naval supply depot at Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, then was appointed in July 1945 to command of a ship repair facility on Okinawa. Shortly thereafter, his command was destroyed by Typhoon Louise, and he subsequently spent some time helping to teach school to Okinawan children.

Later in the war, his service as head of the Electrical Section in the Bureau of Ships brought him a Legion of Merit and gave him experience in directing large development programs, choosing talented technical people, and working closely with private industry. &quot;Time&quot; magazine featured him on the cover of its 11 January 1954 issue. The accompanying article described his wartime service:

Sharp-tongued Hyman Rickover spurred his men to exhaustion, ripped through red tape, drove contractors into rages. He went on making enemies, but by the end of the war he had won the rank of captain. He had also won a reputation as a man &quot;who gets things done.&quot;

== Naval Reactors and the Atomic Energy Commission ==


In December 1945, Rickover was appointed Inspector General of the 19th Fleet on the west coast, and was assigned to work with General Electric at Schenectady, New York, to develop a nuclear propulsion plant for destroyers. In 1946, an initiative was begun at the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Clinton Laboratory (now the Oak Ridge National Laboratory) to develop a nuclear electric generating plant. Realizing the potential that nuclear energy held for the Navy, Rickover applied. Rickover was sent to Oak Ridge through the efforts of his wartime boss, Rear Admiral Earle Mills, who became the head of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ships that same year.

Rickover became an early convert to the idea of nuclear marine propulsion, and was the driving force for shifting the Navy&#x27;s initial focus from applications on destroyers to submarines. Rickover&#x27;s vision was not initially shared by his immediate superiors: he was recalled from Oak Ridge and assigned &quot;advisory duties&quot; with an office in an abandoned ladies&#x27; room in the Navy Building. He subsequently went around several layers of superior officers, and in 1947 went directly to the Chief of Naval Operations, Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, also a former submariner. Nimitz immediately understood the potential of nuclear propulsion in submarines and recommended the project to the Secretary of the Navy, John L. Sullivan. Sullivan&#x27;s endorsement to build the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered vessel, , later caused Rickover to state that Sullivan was &quot;the true father of the Nuclear Navy.&quot;

Subsequently, Rickover became chief of a new section in the Bureau of Ships, the Nuclear Power Division reporting to Mills. He began work with Alvin M. Weinberg, the Oak Ridge director of research, to initiate and develop the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology and to begin the design of the pressurized water reactor for submarine propulsion. In February 1949 he was assigned to the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s Division of Reactor Development, and then assumed control of the Navy&#x27;s effort within the AEC as Director of the Naval Reactors Branch. This twin role enabled him to lead the effort to develop &quot;Nautilus&quot;.

The original selection of Rickover as head of development of the nation&#x27;s nuclear submarine program ultimately rested with Admiral Mills. According to Lieutenant General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, Mills was anxious to have a very determined man involved. He knew that Rickover was &quot;not too easy to get along with&quot; and &quot;not too popular,&quot; but in his judgement Rickover was the man on whom the Navy could depend &quot;no matter what opposition he might encounter&quot;.

While his team and industry were completing construction of &quot;Nautilus&quot;, Rickover was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1953. However, this was anything but routine, and occurred only after an extraordinary chain of events:

[Rickover&#x27;s] peers in the Navy’s engineer branch thought to get rid of him through failure of promotion above captain. This would entail automatic retirement at the thirty-year mark. But someone made the case to the U.S. Senate, charged by the Constitution with formal confirmation of military promotions. In that year, 1953, two years before &quot;Nautilus&quot; first went to sea, the Senate failed to give its usual perfunctory approval of the Navy admiral promotion list, and the press was outraged because Rickover&#x27;s name was not on it. ... Ultimately an enlightened Secretary of the Navy, Robert B. Anderson, ordered a special selection board to sit. With some shuffling of feet it did what it had been ordered to do... Ninety-five percent of Navy captains must retire regardless of how highly qualified because there are only vacancies for 5 percent of them to become admirals, and although vindictiveness has sometimes played a part in determining who shall fail of selection for promotion (thus also violating the system), never before or since have pressures from outside the Navy overturned this form of career-termination.

Regardless of the challenges faced in developing and operating brand-new technology, Rickover and the team did not disappoint: the result was a highly reliable nuclear reactor in a form-factor that would fit into a submarine hull with no more than a beam. This became known as the S1W reactor. &quot;Nautilus&quot; was launched and commissioned with this reactor in 1954.

Later Rickover oversaw the development of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station, the first commercial pressurized water reactor nuclear power plant. Kenneth Nichols of the AEC decided that the Rickover-Westinghouse pressurized-water reactor was &quot;the best choice for a reactor to demonstrate the production of electricity&quot; with Rickover &quot;having a going organization and a reactor project under way that now had no specific use to justify it.&quot; This was a reference to the first core used at Shippingport originating from a cancelled nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. This was accepted by Lewis Strauss and the Commission in January 1954.

Rickover was promoted to vice admiral in 1958, the same year that he was awarded the first of two Congressional Gold Medals. He exercised tight control for the next three decades over the ships, technology, and personnel of the nuclear Navy, interviewing and approving or denying every prospective officer being considered for a nuclear ship. Over the course of Rickover&#x27;s career, these personal interviews numbered in the tens of thousands; over 14,000 interviews were with recent college-graduates alone. The interviewees ranged from midshipmen and newly commissioned ensigns destined for nuclear-powered submarines and surface combatants, to very senior combat-experienced Naval Aviator captains who sought command of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The content of most of these interviews has been lost to history, though some were later chronicled in several books on Rickover&#x27;s career, as well as in a rare personal interview with Diane Sawyer in 1984.

In 1973, though his role and responsibilities remained unchanged, Rickover was promoted to the rank of four-star admiral. This was the second time (after Samuel Murray Robinson) in the history of the U.S. Navy that an officer with a career path other than an operational line officer achieved that rank. Because his responsibilities did not include direct command and control of combatant naval units, technically Rickover was appointed to the grade of admiral on the retired list so as to provide some clarity on this issue. This was also done to avoid affecting the maximum-authorized number of admirals (O-10) on the &quot;active list.&quot;

As head of Naval Reactors, Rickover&#x27;s focus and responsibilities were dedicated to reactor safety rather than tactical or strategic submarine warfare training. However, this extreme focus was well known during Rickover&#x27;s era as a potential hindrance to balancing operational priorities. One way that this was addressed after Rickover retired was that only the very strongest, former at-sea submarine commanders have held Rickover&#x27;s now unique eight-year position as NAVSEA-08, the longest chartered tenure in the U.S. military. From Rickover&#x27;s first replacement, Kinnaird R. McKee, to today&#x27;s head of Naval Reactors, William J. Houston, all have held command of nuclear submarines, their squadrons and ocean fleets, but none have been a long-term Engineering Duty Officer such as Rickover. In keeping with Rickover&#x27;s promotion to four-star admiral, those who were subsequently selected for assignment to Director, Naval Reactors are promoted to this same rank, but also on active duty status.

Historian Francis Duncan, who for over eight years was granted generous access to diverse numbers and levels of witnesses—including U.S. presidents—as well as Rickover himself, came to the conclusion that the man was best understood with respect to a guiding principle that Rickover invoked foremost for both himself and those who served in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s nuclear propulsion program: &quot;exercise of the concept of responsibility.&quot; This is further evidenced by Rickover listing &quot;responsibility&quot; as his first principle in his final-years paper and speech, &quot;Thoughts on Man&#x27;s Purpose in Life.&quot;

=== Safety record ===
Rickover&#x27;s stringent standards are largely credited with being responsible for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s continuing record of zero reactor accidents (defined as the uncontrolled release of fission products to the environment resulting from damage to a reactor core). He made it a point to be aboard during the initial sea trial of almost every nuclear submarine completing its new-construction period. Following the Three Mile Island accident on March 28, 1979, Admiral Rickover was asked to testify before Congress in the general context of answering the question as to why naval nuclear propulsion had succeeded in achieving a record of zero reactor-accidents, as opposed to the dramatic one that had just taken place.

The accident-free record of United States Navy reactor operations stands in some very stark contrast to those of the Soviet Union, which had fourteen known reactor accidents. As stated in a retrospective analysis in October 2007:

U.S. submarines far outperformed the Soviet ones in the crucial area of stealth, and Rickover&#x27;s obsessive fixation on safety and quality control gave the U.S. nuclear Navy a vastly superior safety record to the Soviet one.

=== Views on nuclear power ===
Given Rickover&#x27;s single-minded focus on naval nuclear propulsion, design, and operations, it came as a surprise to many in 1982, near the end of his career, when he testified before the U.S. Congress that, were it up to him what to do with nuclear powered ships, he &quot;would sink them all.&quot; At a congressional hearing Rickover testified that:

A few months later, following his retirement, Rickover spoke more specifically regarding the questions &quot;Could you comment on your own responsibility in helping to create a nuclear navy? Do you have any regrets?&quot;:

I do not have regrets. I believe I helped preserve the peace for this country. Why should I regret that? What I accomplished was approved by Congress—which represents our people. All of you live in safety from domestic enemies because of security from the police. Likewise, you live in safety from foreign enemies because our military keeps them from attacking us. Nuclear technology was already under development in other countries. My assigned responsibility was to develop our nuclear navy. I managed to accomplish this.

==Focus on education==

When he was a child still living in Russian-occupied Poland, Rickover was not allowed to attend public schools because of his Jewish faith. Starting at the age of four, he attended a religious school where the teaching was solely from the &quot;Tanakh&quot;, i.e., &quot;Old Testament&quot;, in Hebrew. Following his formal education in the United States, Rickover developed a decades-long and outspoken interest in the educational standards of the US as being a national security issue, particularly as compared during the Cold War era to Soviet Russia.

An example of his passion for education from his 1959 &quot;Report on Russia&quot; in the context of comparative educational systems:

There is no room here (in nuclear powerplant development) for lofty theories which do not work out in practice. We would not get anywhere if we had the loose, hazy thinking you encounter when you bring out the obvious failures of the American educational system. ... there are times when it is irresponsible to avoid criticizing something which one knows to be wrong and dangerous for the Nation as a whole. I feel that every one who has a position of responsibility in this country and who can see and understand what is happening not only has the right, he has the obligation and the duty to speak. ... This is why I feel so strongly about education—about our failure to give our children as good an education as they deserve and need. ... It is my considered opinion that there is no problem that faces the Congress or the country that is as important.

Rickover believed that US standards of education were unacceptably low. His first book centered on education was a collection of essays calling for improved standards of education, particularly in math and science, entitled &quot;Education and Freedom&quot; (1959). In it, he stated that &quot;education is the most important problem facing the United States today&quot; and &quot;only the massive upgrading of the scholastic standards of our schools will guarantee the future prosperity and freedom of the Republic.&quot; A second book, &quot;Swiss Schools and Ours&quot; (1962) was a scathing comparison of the educational systems of Switzerland and America. He argued that the higher standards of Swiss schools, including a longer school day and year, combined with an approach stressing student choice and academic specialization produced superior results.

Recognizing that &quot;nurturing careers of excellence and leadership in science and technology in young scholars is an essential investment in the United States national and global future,&quot; Rickover founded the Center for Excellence in Education following his retirement in 1983. Additionally, Rickover founded the Research Science Institute (formerly the Rickover Science Institute) in 1984, a summer science program hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for high school seniors from around the world.

== General Dynamics scandal ==
In the early 1980s, structural welding flaws in submarines under construction were covered up by falsified inspection records, and the resulting scandal led to significant delays and expenses in the delivery of several submarines being built at the General Dynamics Electric Boat Division shipyard in Groton, Connecticut. The yard tried to pass on the vast cost overruns to the Navy, while Rickover demanded that the yard make good on its &quot;shoddy&quot; workmanship. The Navy settled with General Dynamics in 1981, paying out $634 million of $843 million in cost overrun and reconstruction claims. Secretary of the Navy John Lehman was partly motivated to seek the agreement in order to continue to focus on achieving President Reagan&#x27;s goal of a 600-ship Navy. But Rickover was extremely bitter over the General Dynamics yard being paid hundreds of millions of dollars, and he lambasted both the settlement and Secretary Lehman. This was not Rickover&#x27;s first clash with the defense industry; he was historically harsh in exacting high standards from defense contractors. It was later publicly announced by a former General Dynamics employee on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; with Mike Wallace that Rickover was right that General Dynamics was lying to the Navy, but by then Rickover&#x27;s public image was already damaged.

A Navy Ad Hoc Gratuities Board determined that Rickover had received gifts from General Dynamics over a 16-year period valued at $67,628, including jewelry, furniture, exotic knives, and gifts that Rickover had in turn presented to politicians. Charges were investigated that gifts were provided by General Electric and the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock, both major nuclear ship contractors for the Navy. Secretary Lehman admonished him in a non-punitive letter and stated that Rickover&#x27;s &quot;fall from grace with these little trinkets should be viewed in the context of his enormous contributions to the Navy.&quot; Rickover released a statement through his lawyer saying his &quot;conscience is clear&quot; with respect to the gifts. &quot;No gratuity or favor ever affected any decision I made.&quot; Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin, a longtime supporter of Rickover, later publicly associated a debilitating stroke suffered by the admiral to his having been censured and &quot;dragged through the mud by the very institution to which he rendered his invaluable service.&quot;

==Forced retirement==
By the late 1970s, Rickover&#x27;s position seemed stronger than it had ever been. Over many years, powerful friends on both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees ensured that he remained on active duty long after most other admirals had retired from their second careers. Jimmy Carter&#x27;s admiration for Rickover was shown by the fact that the title of Carter&#x27;s autobiography was based on a question that Rickover had asked Carter when the latter was in the Navy (&quot;Why Not The Best?&quot;). However, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman felt that Rickover was hindering the well-being of the navy. As Lehman stated in his book, &quot;Command of the Seas&quot;:

One of my first orders of business as Secretary of the Navy would be to solve ... the Rickover problem. Rickover&#x27;s legendary achievements were in the past. His present viselike grip on much of the navy was doing it much harm. I had sought the job because I believed the navy had deteriorated to the point where its weakness seriously threatened our future security. The navy&#x27;s grave afflictions included loss of a strategic vision; loss of self-confidence, and morale; a prolonged starvation of resources, leaving vast shortfalls in capability to do the job; and too few ships to cover a sea so great, all resulting in cynicism, exhaustion, and an undercurrent of defeatism. The cult created by Admiral Rickover was itself a major obstacle to recovery, entwining nearly all the issues of culture and policy within the navy.
Secretary Lehman eventually attained enough political clout to enforce his decision to retire Rickover. This was in part assisted by the admiral&#x27;s nearly insubordinate stance against paying the General Dynamics submarine construction claims, as well as his advanced age and waning political leverage. On 27 July 1981, Lehman was handed the final impetus for ending Rickover&#x27;s career by way of an operational error on the admiral&#x27;s part: a &quot;moderate&quot; loss of ship control and depth excursion while performing a submerged &quot;crash back&quot; maneuver during the sea trials of the newly constructed . Rickover was the actual man-in-charge during this specific performance test, and his actions and inactions were judged to have been the causal factor. On 31 January 1982, five weeks after his 82nd birthday, Rickover was forced to retire from the Navy after 63 years of service under 13 presidents (Woodrow Wilson through Ronald Reagan). According to Rickover, he first learned of his firing when his wife told him what she heard on the radio.

According to former President Jimmy Carter, several weeks following his retirement, Rickover &quot;was invited to the Oval Office and decided to don his full dress uniform. He told me that he refused to take a seat, listened to the president [Reagan] ask him to be his special nuclear advisor, replied &#x27;Mr. President, that is bullshit,&#x27; and then walked out.&quot; The Navy&#x27;s official investigation of General Dynamics&#x27; Electric Boat division was ended shortly afterward. According to Theodore Rockwell, Rickover&#x27;s Technical Director for more than 15 years, more than one source at that time stated that General Dynamics officials were bragging around Washington that they had &quot;gotten Rickover.&quot;

On 28 February 1983, a post-retirement party honoring Admiral Rickover was attended by all three living former U.S. Presidents at the time: Nixon, Ford, and Carter, all formerly officers in the U.S. Navy. President Reagan was not in attendance.

== Public image ==
Rickover has been called &quot;the most famous and controversial admiral of his era.&quot; He was hyperactive, blunt, confrontational, insulting, and a workaholic, always demanding of others without regard for rank or position. Moreover, he had &quot;little tolerance for mediocrity, none for stupidity.&quot; Even while a captain, Rickover did not conceal his opinions, and many of the officers whom he regarded as unintelligent eventually rose to be admirals and were assigned to the Pentagon. Rickover frequently found himself in bureaucratic combat with these senior naval officers, to the point that he almost missed becoming an admiral; two selection boards passed him over for promotion, and it took the intervention of the White House, U.S. Congress, and the Secretary of the Navy before he was promoted.

Rickover&#x27;s military authority and congressional mandate were absolute with regard to the U.S. fleet&#x27;s reactor operations, but his controlling personality was frequently a subject of internal Navy controversy. He was head of the Naval Reactors branch, and thus responsible for signing off on a crew&#x27;s competence to operate the reactor safely, giving him the power to effectively remove a warship from active service, which he did on several occasions. The view became established that he sometimes exercised power to settle scores. Author and former submariner Edward L. Beach Jr. referred to him as a &quot;tyrant&quot; with &quot;no account of his gradually failing powers&quot; in his later years.

== Later life and death ==

On 4 July 1985, Admiral Rickover suffered what was described as a &quot;serious&quot; stroke, and was admitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital, thereafter dealing with partial paralysis in his right arm.

Rickover died at his home in Arlington, Virginia, on 8 July 1986, at age 86. He was buried on 11 July in a small, private ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. On 14 July, memorial services were led by Admiral James D. Watkins at the Washington National Cathedral, with President Carter, Secretary of State George Shultz, Secretary Lehman, senior naval officers, and about 1,000 other people in attendance. At the request of the admiral&#x27;s widow, President Carter read Milton&#x27;s sonnet &quot;When I Consider How My Light is Spent&quot;.

Secretary of the Navy Lehman said in a statement:

With the death of Adm. Rickover, the Navy and this nation have lost a dedicated officer of historic accomplishment. In his 63 years of service, Adm. Rickover took the concept of nuclear power from an idea to the present reality of more than 150 U.S. naval ships under nuclear power, with a record of 3,000 ship-years of accident-free operations.

And the then-Chief of Naval Operations:

&quot;Most important,&quot; Admiral Watkins said, &quot;he was a teacher. He set the standards. They were tough. That is the legacy and the challenge he left to all who study his contributions.&quot;

Rickover is buried in Section 5 at Arlington National Cemetery. His first wife Ruth is buried with him and the name of his second wife Eleonore is inscribed on his gravestone. Eleonore passed away on 5 July 2021, and was buried in Arlington Cemetery. Rickover is survived by Robert Rickover, his sole son by his first wife.

==Honors==

The &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine was named for him. She was commissioned two years before his death, and was, at that time, one of only two Navy ships to be named after a living person since 1900 (there have been 16 more since). The submarine was launched on 27 August 1983, sponsored by his second wife Eleonore, commissioned on 21 July 1984, and deactivated on 14 December 2006. In 2015, the Navy announced a named in his honor. The submarine&#x27;s christening took place on 31 July 2021.

Rickover Hall at the United States Naval Academy houses the departments of Mechanical Engineering, Naval Architecture, Ocean Engineering, and Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering. Rickover Center at Naval Nuclear Power Training Command is located at Joint Base Charleston, where Navy personnel begin their engineering training. In 2011, the U.S. Navy Museum included Rickover as part of the &quot;Technology for the Nuclear Age: Nuclear Propulsion&quot; display for its Cold War exhibit, which featured the following quotation:

Other things named in his honor include the Admiral Hyman Rickover Fellowship at M.I.T., Hyman G. Rickover Naval Academy, and Rickover Junior High School.

<text>This is a list of International Olympic Committee (IOC) country codes.

== Current NOCs ==
There are 206 current NOCs (National Olympic Committees) within the Olympic Movement. The following tables show the currently used code for each NOC and any different codes used in past Games, per the official reports from those Games. Some of the past code usage is further explained in the following sections. Codes used specifically for a Summer Games only or a Winter Games only, within the same year, are indicated by &quot;S&quot; and &quot;W&quot; respectively.

== Current NPCs ==
Most National Paralympic Committees (NPC) cover a territory with an active NOC. In these cases the NPC codes matches the IOC codes shown above. The two current NPCs without a corresponding NOC use the following NPC codes.
== Historic NOCs and teams ==
=== Codes still in use ===
Fourteen historical NOCs or teams have codes that are still used in the IOC results database to refer to past medal winners from these teams.

=== Obsolete codes ===
Unlike the previous list, these codes no longer appear in the IOC results database. When a past athlete from one of these teams has won a medal, the new code is shown next to them instead.

Two other significant code changes have occurred, both because of a change in the nation&#x27;s designation as used by the IOC:
* HOL was changed to NED for the Netherlands for the 1992 Games, reflecting the change in designation from &quot;Holland&quot;.
* IRN was changed to IRI for Iran for the 1992 Games, reflecting the change in designation to &quot;Islamic Republic of Iran&quot;.

== Special codes for Olympics ==
== Special codes for Paralympics ==
== Special codes for World Games ==
The World Games are a multi-sport event comprising sports and sporting disciplines that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The World Games are governed by the International World Games Association, under the patronage of the International Olympic Committee.

<doc id="42353" wikidata="Q3033223" url="?curid=42353" title="Acupressure">
<text>Acupressure is an alternative medicine technique often used in conjunction with acupuncture or reflexology. It is based on the concept of life energy (qi), which purportedly flows through &quot;meridians&quot; in the body. In treatment, physical pressure is applied to acupuncture points, or &quot;ashi&quot; trigger points, with the aim of clearing blockages in these meridians. Pressure may be applied by hand, by elbow, or with various devices. There is no scientific evidence for the existence of acupuncture points, meridians, or qi.

Although some medical studies have suggested that acupressure may be effective at helping manage nausea and vomiting, insomnia, low back pain, migraines, and constipation, among other things, such studies have been found to have a high likelihood of bias. There is no reliable evidence for the effectiveness of acupressure.

== History and origin ==

There are different theories as to the origin of acupressure. One theory posits that it originated in India and then was brought to China. Another theory posits that it originated in China.

=== Indian theory ===
Acupressure therapy was prevalent in India. After the spread of Buddhism to China, the acupressure therapy was also integrated into common medical practice in China and it came to be known as acupuncture. Scholars note these similarities because the major points of Indian acupressure and Chinese acupuncture are similar to each other.

=== Chinese theory ===
The Huangdi Neijing is perhaps the oldest known medical textbook in the world. The Lingshu Jing section mentions acupressure and acupuncture. A case described in the book is the healing of an abscess with a stone needle. 

== Background ==

Acupoints used in treatment may or may not be in the same area of the body as the targeted symptom. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory for the selection of such points and their effectiveness is that they work by stimulating the meridian system to bring about relief by rebalancing yin, yang and qi (also spelled &quot;chi&quot;).

Many East Asian martial arts also make extensive study and use of acupressure for self-defense and health purposes, (chin na, tui na). The points or combinations of points are said to be used to manipulate or incapacitate an opponent. Some martial artists regularly massage their own acupressure points in routines to remove supposed blockages from their own meridians, claiming to thereby enhance their circulation and flexibility and keeping the points &quot;soft&quot; or less vulnerable to an attack.

== Effectiveness ==
A 2011 systematic review of 43 studies of acupressure&#x27;s effectiveness at treating symptoms found that the nature of these 43 studies &quot;indicated a significant likelihood of bias.&quot; Thirty-five of the 43 studies had concluded that acupressure was effective at treating certain symptoms. The authors of this systematic review concluded that this &quot;review of clinical trials from the past decade did not provide rigorous support for the efficacy of acupressure for symptom management. Well-designed, randomized controlled studies are needed to determine the utility and efficacy of acupressure to manage a variety of symptoms in a number of patient populations.&quot;

A 2011 Cochrane review of four trials using acupuncture and nine studies using acupressure to control pain in childbirth concluded that &quot;acupuncture or acupressure may help relieve pain during labour, but more research is needed&quot;. Another Cochrane Collaboration review found that massage provided some long-term benefit for low back pain, and stated: &quot;It seems that acupressure or pressure point massage techniques provide more relief than classic (Swedish) massage, although more research is needed to confirm this.&quot;

An acupressure wristband that is claimed to relieve the symptoms of motion sickness and other forms of nausea provides pressure to the P6 acupuncture point, a point that has been extensively investigated. The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the use of P6 for nausea and vomiting, and found it to be effective for reducing post-operative nausea, but not vomiting. The Cochrane review included various means of stimulating P6, including acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, transcutaneous nerve stimulation, laser stimulation, acustimulation device and acupressure; it did not comment on whether one or more forms of stimulation were more effective; it found low-quality evidence supporting stimulation of P6 compared with sham, with 2 out of 59 trials having low risk of bias. EBM reviewer Bandolier said that P6 in two studies showed 52% of patients with control having a success, compared with 75% with P6.

Quackwatch includes acupressure in a list of methods which have no &quot;rational place&quot; as massage therapy and states that practitioners &quot;may also use irrational diagnostic methods to reach diagnoses that do not correspond to scientific concepts of health and disease.&quot;

Clinical use of acupressure frequently relies on the conceptual framework of traditional Chinese medicine. There is no physically verifiable anatomical or histological basis for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians. Proponents reply that TCM is a prescientific system that continues to have practical relevance. Acupuncturists tend to perceive TCM concepts in functional rather than structural terms (e.g., as being useful in guiding evaluation and care of patients). Trials using placebo have not demonstrated any statistically significant effect but concluded that acupressure is safe to use along with conventional treatment.

== Instruments ==
There are several different instruments for applying nonspecific pressure by rubbing, rolling, or applying pressure on the reflex zones of the body. The acuball is a small ball made of rubber with protuberances that is heatable. It is used to apply pressure and relieve muscle and joint pain. The energy roller is a small cylinder with protuberances. It is held between the hands and rolled back and forth to apply acupressure. The foot roller (also &quot;krupa chakra&quot;) is a round, cylindrical roller with protuberances. It is placed on the floor and the foot is rolled back and forth over it. The power mat (also pyramid mat) is a mat with small pyramid-shaped bumps that you walk on. The spine roller is a bumpy roller containing magnets that is rolled up and down the spine. The Teishein is one of the original nine classical acupuncture needles described in the original texts of acupuncture. Even though it is described as an acupuncture needle it did not pierce the skin. It is used to apply rapid percussion pressure to the points being treated.

<doc id="42357" wikidata="Q34851" url="?curid=42357" title="Elizabeth Taylor">
<text>Dame Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor (February 27, 1932 – March 23, 2011) was a British and American actress. She began her career as a child actress in the early 1940s and was one of the most popular stars of classical Hollywood cinema in the 1950s. She then became the world&#x27;s highest-paid movie star in the 1960s, remaining a well-known public figure for the rest of her life. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked her seventh on its greatest female screen legends list.

Born in London to socially prominent American parents, Taylor moved with her family to Los Angeles in 1939 at the age of 7. She made her acting debut with a minor role in the Universal Pictures film &quot;There&#x27;s One Born Every Minute&quot; (1942), but the studio ended her contract after a year. She was then signed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and became a popular teen star after appearing in &quot;National Velvet&quot; (1944). She transitioned to mature roles in the 1950s, when she starred in the comedy &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1950) and received critical acclaim for her performance in the drama &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951). She starred in the historical adventure epic &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1952) with Robert Taylor and Joan Fontaine. Despite being one of MGM&#x27;s most bankable stars, Taylor wished to end her career in the early 1950s. She resented the studio&#x27;s control and disliked many of the films to which she was assigned.

She began receiving more enjoyable roles in the mid-1950s, beginning with the epic drama &quot;Giant&quot; (1956), and starred in several critically and commercially successful films in the following years. These included two film adaptations of plays by Tennessee Williams: &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1958), and &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; (1959); Taylor won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for the latter. Although she disliked her role as a call girl in &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot; (1960), her last film for MGM, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. During the production of the film &quot;Cleopatra&quot; in 1961, Taylor and co-star Richard Burton began an extramarital affair, which caused a scandal. Despite public disapproval, they continued their relationship and were married in 1964. Dubbed &quot;Liz and Dick&quot; by the media, they starred in 11 films together, including &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; (1963), &quot;The Sandpiper&quot; (1965), &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1967), and &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (1966). Taylor received the best reviews of her career for &quot;Woolf&quot;, winning her second Academy Award and several other awards for her performance. She and Burton divorced in 1974 but reconciled soon after, remarrying in 1975. The second marriage ended in divorce in 1976.

Taylor&#x27;s acting career began to decline in the late 1960s, although she continued starring in films until the mid-1970s, after which she focused on supporting the career of her sixth husband, United States Senator John Warner. In the 1980s, she acted in her first substantial stage roles and in several television films and series. She became the second celebrity to launch a perfume brand after Sophia Loren. Taylor was one of the first celebrities to take part in HIV/AIDS activism. She co-founded the American Foundation for AIDS Research in 1985 and the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation in 1991. From the early 1990s until her death, she dedicated her time to philanthropy, for which she received several accolades, including the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2001.

Throughout her career, Taylor&#x27;s personal life was the subject of constant media attention. She was married eight times to seven men, converted to Judaism, endured several serious illnesses, and led a jet set lifestyle, including assembling one of the most expensive private collections of jewelry in the world. After many years of ill health, Taylor died from congestive heart failure in 2011, at the age of 79.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor was born on 27 February 1932, at Heathwood, her family&#x27;s home at 8 Wildwood Road in Hampstead Garden Suburb, northwest London, England. She received dual British–American citizenship at birth as her parents, art dealer Francis Lenn Taylor (1897–1968) and stage actress Sara Sothern (1895–1994), were United States citizens, both originally from Arkansas City, Kansas.

They had moved to London in 1929 and opened an art gallery on Bond Street; their first child, a son named Howard (died 2020), was born the same year.
The family lived in London during Taylor&#x27;s childhood. Their social circle included artists such as Augustus John and Laura Knight and politicians such as Colonel Victor Cazalet. Cazalet was Taylor&#x27;s unofficial godfather and an important influence in her early life. She was enrolled in Byron House School, a Montessori school in Highgate, and was raised according to the teachings of Christian Science, the religion of her mother and Cazalet.

In early 1939, the Taylors decided to return to the United States due to fear of impending war in Europe. United States ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy contacted her father, urging him to return to the US with his family. Sara and the children left first in April 1939 aboard the ocean liner SS &quot;Manhattan&quot; and moved in with Taylor&#x27;s maternal grandfather in Pasadena, California. Francis stayed behind to close the London gallery and joined them in December. In early 1940, he opened a new gallery in Los Angeles. After briefly living in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, with the Chapman family, the Taylor family settled in Beverly Hills, California, where the two children were enrolled in Hawthorne School.

==Acting career==
===1941–1949: Early roles and teenage stardom===
In California, Taylor&#x27;s mother was frequently told that her daughter should audition for films. Taylor&#x27;s eyes in particular drew attention; they were blue, to the extent of appearing violet, and were rimmed by dark double eyelashes caused by a genetic mutation. Sara was initially opposed to Taylor appearing in films, but after the outbreak of war in Europe made return there unlikely, she began to view the film industry as a way of assimilating to American society. Francis Taylor&#x27;s Beverly Hills gallery had gained clients from the film industry soon after opening, helped by the endorsement of gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, a friend of the Cazalets. Through a client and a school friend&#x27;s father, Taylor auditioned for both Universal Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in early 1941. Both studios offered Taylor contracts, and Sara Taylor chose to accept Universal&#x27;s offer.

Taylor began her contract in April 1941 and was cast in a small role in &quot;There&#x27;s One Born Every Minute&quot; (1942). She did not receive other roles, and her contract was terminated after a year. Universal&#x27;s casting director explained her dislike of Taylor, stating that &quot;the kid has nothing ... her eyes are too old, she doesn&#x27;t have the face of a child&quot;. Biographer Alexander Walker agrees that Taylor looked different from the child stars of the era, such as Shirley Temple and Judy Garland. Taylor later said that, &quot;apparently, I used to frighten grown ups, because I was totally direct&quot;.

Taylor received another opportunity in late 1942, when her father&#x27;s acquaintance, MGM producer Samuel Marx, arranged for her to audition for a minor role in &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot; (1943), which required a child actress with an English accent. After a trial contract of three months, she was given a standard seven-year contract in January 1943. Following &quot;Lassie&quot;, she appeared in minor uncredited roles in two other films set in England – &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1943) playing Helen Burns, and &quot;The White Cliffs of Dover&quot; (1944).

 Taylor was cast in her first starring role at the age of 12, when she was chosen to play a girl who wants to compete as a jockey in the exclusively male Grand National in &quot;National Velvet&quot;. She later called it &quot;the most exciting film&quot; of her career. Since 1937, MGM had been looking for a suitable actress with a British accent and the ability to ride horses. They decided on Taylor at the recommendation of &quot;White Cliffs&quot; director Clarence Brown, who knew she had the necessary skills. At that time Taylor was deemed too short for the role, so filming was delayed several months in order for her to grow an inch or two. In the interim Taylor spent her time practicing her horseback riding.

In MGM&#x27;s effort developing Taylor into a film star, they required her to wear braces to straighten her teeth, and had two of her baby teeth pulled out. The studio also wanted to dye her hair, change the shape of her eyebrows, and proposed that she use the screen name &quot;Virginia&quot;, but Taylor and her parents refused.

&quot;National Velvet&quot; became a box-office success upon its release on Christmas 1944. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;her whole manner in this picture is one of refreshing grace&quot;, while James Agee of &quot;The Nation&quot; wrote that she &quot;is rapturously beautiful... I hardly know or care whether she can act or not.&quot;

Taylor later stated that her childhood ended when she became a star, as MGM started to control every aspect of her life. She described the studio as a &quot;big extended factory actory&quot;, where she was required to adhere to a strict daily schedule. Her days were spent attending school, and filming at the studio lot. In the evenings, Taylor took dancing and singing classes, and practiced the following day&#x27;s scenes. Following the success of &quot;National Velvet&quot;, MGM gave Taylor a new seven-year contract with a weekly salary of $750. They cast her in a minor role in the third film of the Lassie series, &quot;Courage of Lassie&quot; (1946). MGM also published a book of Taylor&#x27;s writings about her pet chipmunk, &quot;Nibbles and Me&quot; (1946), and had paper dolls and coloring books made in her likeness.

 When Taylor turned 15 in 1947, MGM began to cultivate a more mature public image for her by organizing photo shoots and interviews that portrayed her as a &quot;normal&quot; teenager attending parties and going on dates. Film magazines and gossip columnists also began comparing her to older actresses such as Ava Gardner and Lana Turner. &quot;Life&quot; called her &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s most accomplished junior actress&quot; for her two film roles that year. In the critically panned &quot;Cynthia&quot; (1947), Taylor portrayed a frail girl who defies her over-protective parents to go to the prom; in the period film &quot;Life with Father&quot; (1947), opposite William Powell and Irene Dunne, she portrayed the love interest of a stockbroker&#x27;s son.

They were followed by supporting roles as a teenaged &quot;man-stealer&quot; who seduces her peer&#x27;s date to a high school dance in the musical &quot;A Date with Judy&quot; (1948), and as a bride in the romantic comedy &quot;Julia Misbehaves&quot; (1948). This became a commercial success, grossing over $4 million in the box office.

Taylor&#x27;s last adolescent role was as Amy March in Mervyn LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot; (1949), a box-office success. The same year, &quot;Time&quot; featured Taylor on its cover, and called her the leader among Hollywood&#x27;s next generation of stars, &quot;a jewel of great price, a true sapphire&quot;.

===1950–1951: Transition to adult roles===
Taylor made the transition to adult roles when she turned 18 in 1950. In her first mature role, the thriller &quot;Conspirator&quot; (1949), she plays a woman who begins to suspect that her husband is a Soviet spy. Taylor had been only 16 at the time of its filming, but its release was delayed until March 1950, as MGM disliked it and feared it could cause diplomatic problems. Taylor&#x27;s second film of 1950 was the comedy &quot;The Big Hangover&quot; (1950), co-starring Van Johnson. It was released in May. That same month, Taylor married hotel-chain heir Conrad &quot;Nicky&quot; Hilton Jr. in a highly publicized ceremony. The event was organized by MGM, and used as part of the publicity campaign for Taylor&#x27;s next film, Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s comedy &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1950), in which she appeared opposite Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennett as a bride preparing for her wedding. The film became a box-office success upon its release in June, grossing $6 million worldwide ($ in dollars ), and was followed by a successful sequel, &quot;Father&#x27;s Little Dividend&quot; (1951), ten months later.

Taylor&#x27;s next film release, George Stevens&#x27; &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951), marked a departure from her earlier films. According to Taylor, it was the first film in which she had been asked to act, instead of simply being herself, and it brought her critical acclaim for the first time since &quot;National Velvet&quot;. Based on Theodore Dreiser&#x27;s novel &quot;An American Tragedy&quot; (1925), it featured Taylor as a spoiled socialite who comes between a poor factory worker (Montgomery Clift) and his pregnant girlfriend (Shelley Winters). Stevens cast Taylor as she was &quot;the only one ... who could create this illusion&quot; of being &quot;not so much a real girl as the girl on the candy-box cover, the beautiful girl in the yellow Cadillac convertible that every American boy sometime or other thinks he can marry.&quot;

&quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; was a critical and commercial success, grossing $3 million. Herb Golden of &quot;Variety&quot; said that Taylor&#x27;s &quot;histrionics are of a quality so far beyond anything she has done previously, that Stevens&#x27; skilled hands on the reins must be credited with a minor miracle.&quot; A.H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that she gives &quot;a shaded, tender performance, and one in which her passionate and genuine romance avoids the pathos common to young love as it sometimes comes to the screen.&quot;

===1952–1955: Continued success at MGM===
Taylor next starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Love Is Better Than Ever&quot; (1952). According to Alexander Walker, MGM cast her in the &quot;B-picture&quot; as a reprimand for divorcing Hilton in January 1951 after only eight months of marriage, which had caused a public scandal that reflected negatively on her. After completing &quot;Love Is Better Than Ever&quot;, Taylor was sent to Britain to take part in the historical epic &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1952), which was one of the most expensive projects in the studio&#x27;s history. She was not happy about the project, finding the story superficial and her role as Rebecca too small. Regardless, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; became one of MGM&#x27;s biggest commercial successes, earning $11 million in worldwide rentals.
Taylor&#x27;s last film made under her old contract with MGM was &quot;The Girl Who Had Everything&quot; (1953), a remake of the pre-code drama &quot;A Free Soul&quot; (1931). Despite her grievances with the studio, Taylor signed a new seven-year contract with MGM in the summer of 1952. Although she wanted more interesting roles, the decisive factor in continuing with the studio was her financial need; she had recently married British actor Michael Wilding, and was pregnant with her first child. In addition to granting her a weekly salary of $4,700 ($ in dollars ), MGM agreed to give the couple a loan for a house, and signed her husband for a three-year contract. Due to her financial dependency, the studio now had even more control over her than previously.
Taylor&#x27;s first two films made under her new contract were released ten days apart in early 1954. The first was &quot;Rhapsody&quot;, a romantic film starring her as a woman caught in a love triangle with two musicians. The second was &quot;Elephant Walk&quot;, a drama in which she played a British woman struggling to adapt to life on her husband&#x27;s tea plantation in Ceylon. She had been loaned to Paramount Pictures for the film after its original star, Vivien Leigh, fell ill.

In the fall, Taylor starred in two more film releases. &quot;Beau Brummell&quot; was a Regency era period film, another project in which she was cast against her will. Taylor disliked historical films in general, as their elaborate costumes and makeup required her to wake up earlier than usual to prepare. She later said that she gave one of the worst performances of her career in &quot;Beau Brummell&quot;. The second film was Richard Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot;, based on F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s short story. Although she had wanted to be cast in &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; (1954) instead, Taylor liked the film, and later stated that it &quot;convinced me I wanted to be an actress instead of yawning my way through parts.&quot; While &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot; was not as profitable as many other MGM films, it garnered positive reviews. Taylor became pregnant again during the production, and had to agree to add another year to her contract to make up for the period spent on maternity leave.

===1956–1960: Critical acclaim===
By the mid-1950s, the American film industry was beginning to face serious competition from television, which resulted in studios producing fewer films, and focusing instead on their quality. The change benefited Taylor, who finally found more challenging roles after several years of career disappointments. After lobbying director George Stevens, she won the female lead role in &quot;Giant&quot; (1956), an epic drama about a ranching dynasty, which co-starred Rock Hudson and James Dean. Its filming in Marfa, Texas, was a difficult experience for Taylor, as she clashed with Stevens, who wanted to break her will to make her easier to direct, and was often ill, resulting in delays. To further complicate the production, Dean died in a car accident only days after completing filming; the grieving Taylor still had to film reaction shots to their joint scenes. When &quot;Giant&quot; was released a year later, it became a box-office success, and was widely praised by critics. Although not nominated for an Academy Award like her co-stars, Taylor garnered positive reviews for her performance, with &quot;Variety&quot; calling it &quot;surprisingly clever&quot;, and &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; lauding her acting as &quot;an astonishing revelation of unsuspected gifts.&quot; It named her one of the film&#x27;s strongest assets.

MGM reunited Taylor with Montgomery Clift in &quot;Raintree County&quot; (1957), a Civil War drama which it hoped would replicate the success of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). Taylor found her role as a mentally disturbed Southern belle fascinating, but overall disliked the film. Although the film failed to become the type of success MGM had planned, Taylor was nominated for the first time for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.

Taylor considered her next performance as Maggie the Cat in the screen adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1958) a career &quot;high point.&quot; But it coincided with one of the most difficult periods in her personal life. After completing &quot;Raintree Country&quot;, she had divorced Wilding and married producer Mike Todd. She had completed only two weeks of filming in March 1958, when Todd was killed in a plane crash. Although she was devastated, pressure from the studio and the knowledge that Todd had large debts led Taylor to return to work only three weeks later. She later said that &quot;in a way ... [she] became Maggie&quot;, and that acting &quot;was the only time I could function&quot; in the weeks after Todd&#x27;s death.

During the production, Taylor&#x27;s personal life drew more attention when she began an affair with singer Eddie Fisher, whose marriage to actress Debbie Reynolds had been idealized by the media as the union of &quot;America&#x27;s sweethearts.&quot; The affair – and Fisher&#x27;s subsequent divorce – changed Taylor&#x27;s public image from a grieving widow to a &quot;homewrecker&quot;. MGM used the scandal to its advantage by featuring an image of Taylor posing on a bed in a slip in the film&#x27;s promotional posters. &quot;Cat&quot; grossed $10 million in American cinemas alone, and made Taylor the year&#x27;s second-most profitable star. She received positive reviews for her performance, with Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling her &quot;terrific&quot;, and &quot;Variety&quot; praising her for &quot;a well-accented, perceptive interpretation.&quot; Taylor was nominated for an Academy Award and a BAFTA.

Taylor&#x27;s next film, Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; (1959), was another Tennessee Williams adaptation, with a screenplay by Gore Vidal and also starring Montgomery Clift and Katharine Hepburn. The independent production earned Taylor $500,000 for playing the role of a severely traumatized patient in a mental institution. Although the film was a drama about mental illness, childhood traumas, and homosexuality, it was again promoted with Taylor&#x27;s sex appeal; both its trailer and poster featured her in a white swimsuit. The strategy worked, as the film was a financial success. Taylor received her third Academy Award nomination and her first Golden Globe for Best Actress for her performance.

By 1959, Taylor owed one more film for MGM, which it decided should be &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot; (1960), a drama about a high-class call girl, in an adaptation of a John O&#x27;Hara 1935 novel of the same name. The studio correctly calculated that Taylor&#x27;s public image would make it easy for audiences to associate her with the role. She hated the film for the same reason, but had no choice in the matter, although the studio agreed to her demands of filming in New York and casting Eddie Fisher in a sympathetic role. As predicted, &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot; was a major commercial success, grossing $18 million in world rentals. Crowther wrote that Taylor &quot;looks like a million dollars, in mink or in negligée&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot; stated that she gives &quot;a torrid, stinging portrayal with one or two brilliantly executed passages within.&quot; Taylor won her first Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.

===1961–1967: &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and other collaborations with Richard Burton===

After completing her MGM contract, Taylor starred in 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963). According to film historian Alexander Doty, this historical epic made her more famous than ever before. She became the first movie star to be paid $1 million for a role; Fox also granted her 10% of the film&#x27;s gross profits, as well as shooting the film in Todd-AO, a widescreen format for which she had inherited the rights from Mike Todd. The film&#x27;s production – characterized by costly sets and costumes, constant delays, and a scandal caused by Taylor&#x27;s extramarital affair with her co-star Richard Burton – was closely followed by the media, with &quot;Life&quot; proclaiming it the &quot;Most Talked About Movie Ever Made.&quot; Filming began in England in 1960, but had to be halted several times because of bad weather and Taylor&#x27;s ill health. In March 1961, she developed nearly fatal pneumonia, which necessitated a tracheotomy; one news agency erroneously reported that she had died. Once she had recovered, Fox discarded the already filmed material, and moved the production to Rome, changing its director to Joseph Mankiewicz, and the actor playing Mark Antony to Burton. Filming was finally completed in July 1962. The film&#x27;s final cost was $62 million (equivalent to $ million in ), making it the most expensive film made up to that point.

&quot;Cleopatra&quot; became the biggest box-office success of 1963 in the United States; the film grossed $15.7 million at the box office (equivalent to $ million in ). Regardless, it took several years for the film to earn back its production costs, which drove Fox near to bankruptcy. The studio publicly blamed Taylor for the production&#x27;s troubles and unsuccessfully sued Burton and Taylor for allegedly damaging the film&#x27;s commercial prospects with their behavior. The film&#x27;s reviews were mixed to negative, with critics finding Taylor overweight and her voice too thin, and unfavorably comparing her with her classically trained British co-stars. In retrospect, Taylor called &quot;Cleopatra&quot; a &quot;low point&quot; in her career, and said that the studio had cut out the scenes which she felt provided the &quot;core of the characterization.&quot;

Taylor intended to follow &quot;Cleopatra&quot; by headlining an all-star cast in Fox&#x27;s black comedy &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot; (1964), but negotiations fell through, and Shirley MacLaine was cast instead. In the meantime, film producers were eager to profit from the scandal surrounding Taylor and Burton, and they next starred together in Anthony Asquith&#x27;s &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; (1963), which mirrored the headlines about them. Taylor played a famous model attempting to leave her husband for a lover, and Burton her estranged millionaire husband. Released soon after &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, it became a box-office success. Taylor was also paid $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) to appear in a CBS television special, &quot;Elizabeth Taylor in London&quot;, in which she visited the city&#x27;s landmarks and recited passages from the works of famous British writers.

After completing &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot;, Taylor took a two-year hiatus from films, during which she and Burton divorced their spouses and married each other. The supercouple continued starring together in films in the mid-1960s, earning a combined $88 million over the next decade; Burton once stated, &quot;They say we generate more business activity than one of the smaller African nations.&quot; Biographer Alexander Walker compared these films to &quot;illustrated gossip columns&quot;, as their film roles often reflected their public personae, while film historian Alexander Doty has noted that the majority of Taylor&#x27;s films during this period seemed to &quot;conform to, and reinforce, the image of an indulgent, raucous, immoral or amoral, and appetitive (in many senses of the word) &#x27;Elizabeth Taylor. Taylor and Burton&#x27;s first joint project following her hiatus was Vincente Minelli&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;The Sandpiper&quot; (1965), about an illicit love affair between a bohemian artist and a married clergyman in Big Sur, California. Its reviews were largely negative, but it grossed a successful $14 million in the box office (equivalent to $ million in ).

Their next project, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (1966), an adaptation of a play of the same name by Edward Albee, featured the most critically acclaimed performance of Taylor&#x27;s career. She and Burton starred as Martha and George, a middle-aged couple going through a marital crisis. In order to convincingly play 50-year-old Martha, Taylor gained weight, wore a wig, and used makeup to make herself look older and tired – in stark contrast to her public image as a glamorous film star. At Taylor&#x27;s suggestion, theatre director Mike Nichols was hired to direct the project, despite his lack of experience with film. The production differed from anything she had done previously, as Nichols wanted to thoroughly rehearse the play before beginning filming. &quot;Woolf&quot; was considered ground-breaking for its adult themes and uncensored language, and opened to &quot;glorious&quot; reviews. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that Taylor&#x27;s &quot;characterization is at once sensual, spiteful, cynical, pitiable, loathsome, lustful, and tender.&quot; Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that she &quot;does the best work of her career, sustained and urgent.&quot; The film also became one of the biggest commercial successes of the year. Taylor received her second Academy Award, and BAFTA, National Board of Review, and New York City Film Critics Circle awards for her performance.

In 1966, Taylor and Burton performed &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; for a week in Oxford to benefit the Oxford University Dramatic Society; he starred and she appeared in her first stage role as Helen of Troy, a part which required no speaking. Although it received generally negative reviews, Burton produced it as a film, &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; (1967), with the same cast. It was also panned by critics and grossed only $600,000 in the box office (equivalent to $ million in ). Taylor and Burton&#x27;s next project, Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1967), which they also co-produced, was more successful. It posed another challenge for Taylor, as she was the only actor in the project with no previous experience of performing Shakespeare; Zeffirelli later stated that this made her performance interesting, as she &quot;invented the part from scratch.&quot; Critics found the play to be fitting material for the couple, and the film became a box-office success by grossing $12 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

Taylor&#x27;s third film released in 1967, John Huston&#x27;s &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot;, was her first without Burton since &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. Based on a novel of the same name by Carson McCullers, it was a drama about a repressed gay military officer and his unfaithful wife. It was originally slated to co-star Taylor&#x27;s old friend Montgomery Clift, whose career had been in decline for several years owing to his substance abuse problems. Determined to secure his involvement in the project, Taylor even offered to pay for his insurance. But Clift died from a heart attack before filming began; he was replaced in the role by Marlon Brando. &quot;Reflections&quot; was a critical and commercial failure at the time of its release. Taylor and Burton&#x27;s last film of the year was the adaptation of Graham Greene&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Comedians&quot;, which received mixed reviews and was a box-office disappointment.

===1968–1979: Career decline===
Taylor&#x27;s career was in decline by the late 1960s. She had gained weight, was in her late 30s and did not fit in with New Hollywood stars such as Jane Fonda and Julie Christie. After several years of nearly constant media attention, the public was tiring of Burton and her, and criticized their jet set lifestyle. In 1968, Taylor starred in two films directed by Joseph Losey – &quot;Boom!&quot; and &quot;Secret Ceremony&quot; – both of which were critical and commercial failures. The former, based on Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Milk Train Doesn&#x27;t Stop Here Anymore&quot;, features her as an ageing, serial-marrying millionaire, and Burton as a younger man who turns up on the Mediterranean island on which she has retired. &quot;Secret Ceremony&quot; is a psychological drama that also stars Mia Farrow and Robert Mitchum. Taylor&#x27;s third film with George Stevens, &quot;The Only Game in Town&quot; (1970), in which she played a Las Vegas showgirl who has an affair with a compulsive gambler, played by Warren Beatty, was unsuccessful.

The three 1972 films in which Taylor acted were somewhat more successful. &quot;X Y &amp; Zee&quot;, which portrayed Michael Caine and her as a troubled married couple, won her the David di Donatello for Best Foreign Actress. She appeared with Burton in the adaptation of Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;; although her role was small, the producers decided to give her top-billing to profit from her fame. Her third film role that year was playing a blonde diner waitress in Peter Ustinov&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; parody &quot;Hammersmith Is Out&quot;, her tenth collaboration with Burton. Although it was overall not successful, Taylor received some good reviews, with Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing that she has &quot;a certain vulgar, ratty charm&quot;, and Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; saying, &quot;The spectacle of Elizabeth Taylor growing older and more beautiful continues to amaze the population.&quot; Her performance won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the Berlin Film Festival.

Taylor and Burton&#x27;s last film together was the Harlech Television film &quot;Divorce His, Divorce Hers&quot; (1973), fittingly named as they divorced the following year. Her other films released in 1973 were the British thriller &quot;Night Watch&quot; (1973) and the American drama &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; (1973). For the latter, in which she starred as a woman who undergoes multiple plastic surgeries in an attempt to save her marriage, she received a Golden Globe nomination. Her only film released in 1974, the Italian Muriel Spark adaptation &quot;The Driver&#x27;s Seat&quot; (1974), was a failure.

Taylor took fewer roles after the mid-1970s, and focused on supporting the career of her sixth husband, Republican politician John Warner, a US senator. In 1976, she participated in the Soviet-American fantasy film &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; (1976), a critical and box-office failure, and had a small role in the television film &quot;Victory at Entebbe&quot; (1976). In 1977, she sang in the critically panned film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; (1977).

===1980–2007: Stage and television roles; retirement===
After a period of semi-retirement from films, Taylor starred in &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot; (1980), adapted from an Agatha Christie mystery novel and featuring an ensemble cast of actors from the studio era, such as Angela Lansbury, Kim Novak, Rock Hudson, and Tony Curtis. Wanting to challenge herself, she took on her first substantial stage role, playing Regina Giddens in a Broadway production of Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;. Instead of portraying Giddens in negative light, as had often been the case in previous productions, Taylor&#x27;s idea was to show her as a victim of circumstance, explaining, &quot;She&#x27;s a killer, but she&#x27;s saying, &#x27;Sorry fellas, you put me in this position&#x27;.&quot;

The production premiered in May 1981, and had a sold-out six-month run despite mixed reviews. Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Taylor&#x27;s performance as &quot;Regina Giddens, that malignant Southern bitch-goddess ... begins gingerly, soon gathers steam, and then explodes into a black and thunderous storm that may just knock you out of your seat&quot;, while Dan Sullivan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated, &quot;Taylor presents a possible Regina Giddens, as seen through the persona of Elizabeth Taylor. There&#x27;s some acting in it, as well as some personal display.&quot; She appeared as evil socialite Helena Cassadine in the day-time soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; in November 1981. The following year, she continued performing &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; in London&#x27;s West End, but received largely negative reviews from the British press.

Encouraged by the success of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, Taylor and producer Zev Buffman founded the Elizabeth Taylor Repertory Company. Its first and only production was a revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s comedy &quot;Private Lives&quot;, starring Taylor and Burton. It premiered in Boston in early 1983, and although commercially successful, received generally negative reviews, with critics noting that both stars were in noticeably poor health – Taylor admitted herself to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center after the play&#x27;s run ended, and Burton died the following year. After the failure of &quot;Private Lives&quot;, Taylor dissolved her theatre company. Her only other project that year was the television film &quot;Between Friends&quot;.

From the mid-1980s, Taylor acted mostly in television productions. She made cameos in the soap operas &quot;Hotel&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot; in 1984, and played a brothel keeper in the historical mini-series &quot;North and South&quot; in 1985. She also starred in several television films, playing gossip columnist Louella Parsons in &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot; (1985), a &quot;fading movie star&quot; in the drama &quot;There Must Be a Pony&quot; (1986), and a character based on Poker Alice in the eponymous Western (1987). She re-united with director Franco Zeffirelli to appear in his French-Italian biopic &quot;Young Toscanini&quot; (1988), and had the last starring role of her career in a television adaptation of &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (1989), her fourth Tennessee Williams play. During this time, she also began receiving honorary awards for her career – the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1985, and the Film Society of Lincoln Center&#x27;s Chaplin Award in 1986.

In the 1990s, Taylor focused her time on HIV/AIDS activism. Her few acting roles included characters in the animated series &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1992, 1993), and cameos in four CBS series – &quot;The Nanny&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, and &quot;High Society&quot; – all airing on February 26, 1996, to promote her new fragrance.

Her last theatrically released film was in the critically panned, but commercially successful, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1994), in which she played Pearl Slaghoople in a brief supporting role. Taylor received American and British honors for her career: the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1993, the Screen Actors Guild honorary award in 1997, and a BAFTA Fellowship in 1999. In 2000, she was appointed a Dame Commander in the chivalric Order of the British Empire in the millennium New Year Honours List by Queen Elizabeth II. After supporting roles in the television film &quot;These Old Broads&quot; (2001) and in the animated sitcom &quot;God, the Devil and Bob&quot; (2001), Taylor announced that she was retiring from acting to devote her time to philanthropy. She gave one last public performance in 2007, when she performed the play &quot;Love Letters&quot; at an AIDS benefit at the Paramount Studios with James Earl Jones.

==Other ventures==
===HIV/AIDS activism===
Taylor was one of the first celebrities to participate in HIV/AIDS activism and helped to raise more than $270 million for the cause since the mid-1980s. She began her philanthropic work after becoming frustrated with the fact that very little was being done to combat the disease despite the media attention. She later explained for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that she &quot;decided that with my name, I could open certain doors, that I was a commodity in myself – and I&#x27;m not talking as an actress. I could take the fame I&#x27;d resented and tried to get away from for so many years – but you can never get away from it – and use it to do some good. I wanted to retire, but the tabloids wouldn&#x27;t let me. So, I thought: If you&#x27;re going to screw me over, I&#x27;ll use you.&quot;

Taylor began her philanthropic efforts in 1984, helping to organize and by hosting the first AIDS fundraiser to benefit the AIDS Project Los Angeles. In August 1985, she and Michael Gottlieb founded the National AIDS Research Foundation after her friend and former co-star Rock Hudson announced that he was dying of the disease. The following month, the foundation merged with Mathilde Krim&#x27;s AIDS foundation to form the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR). As amfAR&#x27;s focus is on research funding, Taylor founded the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation (ETAF) in 1991 to raise awareness and to provide support services for people with HIV/AIDS, paying for its overhead costs herself. Since her death, her estate has continued to fund ETAF&#x27;s work, and donates 25% of royalties from the use of her image and likeness to the foundation. In addition to her work for people affected by HIV/AIDS in the United States, Taylor was instrumental in expanding amfAR&#x27;s operations to other countries; ETAF also operates internationally.

Taylor testified before the Senate and House for the Ryan White Care Act in 1986, 1990, and 1992. She persuaded President Ronald Reagan to acknowledge the disease for the first time in a speech in 1987, and publicly criticized presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton for lack of interest in combatting the disease. Taylor also founded the Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center to offer free HIV/AIDS testing and care at the Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington, DC, and the Elizabeth Taylor Endowment Fund for the UCLA Clinical AIDS Research and Education Center in Los Angeles. In 2015, Taylor&#x27;s business partner Kathy Ireland claimed that Taylor ran an illegal &quot;underground network&quot; that distributed medications to Americans suffering from HIV/AIDS during the 1980s, when the Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved them. The claim was challenged by several people, including amfAR&#x27;s former vice-president for development and external affairs, Taylor&#x27;s former publicist, and activists who were involved in Project Inform in the 1980s and 1990s.

Taylor was honored with several awards for her philanthropic work. She was made a Knight of the French Legion of Honour in 1987, and received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1993, the Screen Actors&#x27; Guild Lifetime Achievement Award for Humanitarian service in 1997, the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2000, and the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2001.

===Fragrance and jewelry brands===
Taylor created a collection of fragrances whose unprecedented success helped establish the trend of celebrity-branded perfumes in later years. In collaboration with Elizabeth Arden, Inc., she began by launching two best-selling perfumes – Passion in 1987, and White Diamonds in 1991. Taylor personally supervised the creation and production of each of the 11 fragrances marketed in her name. According to biographers Sam Kashner and Nancy Schoenberger, she earned more money through the fragrance collection than during her entire acting career, and upon her death, the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; estimated that the majority of her estimated $600 million-$1 billion estate consisted of revenue from fragrances. In 2005, Taylor also founded a jewelry company, House of Taylor, in collaboration with Kathy Ireland and Jack and Monty Abramov.

==Personal life==
===Marriages, relationships, and children===

Throughout her adult years, Taylor&#x27;s personal life, especially her eight marriages (two to the same man), drew a large amount of media attention and public disapproval. According to biographer Alexander Walker, &quot;Whether she liked it or not ... marriage is the matrix of the myth that began surrounding Elizabeth Taylor from [when she was sixteen].&quot; In 1948, MGM arranged for her to date American football champion Glenn Davis and she announced plans for them to marry once he returned from Korea. The following year, Taylor was briefly engaged to William Pawley Jr., son of US ambassador William D. Pawley. Film tycoon Howard Hughes also wanted to marry her, and offered to pay her parents a six-figure sum of money if she were to become his wife. Taylor declined the offer, but was otherwise eager to marry young, as her &quot;rather puritanical upbringing and beliefs&quot; made her believe that &quot;love was synonymous with marriage.&quot; Taylor later described herself as being &quot;emotionally immature&quot; during this time due to her sheltered childhood, and believed that she could gain independence from her parents and MGM through marriage.

Taylor was 18 years old when she married Conrad &quot;Nicky&quot; Hilton Jr., heir to the Hilton Hotels chain, at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills on May 6, 1950. MGM organized the large and expensive wedding, which became a major media event. In the weeks after their wedding, Taylor realized that she had made a mistake; not only did she and Hilton have few interests in common, but he was also abusive and a heavy drinker. Taylor suffered a miscarriage during one of his violent outbursts. She announced their separation on December 14, 1950, and was granted a divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty on January 29, 1951, eight months after their wedding.

Taylor married her second husband, British actor Michael Wilding – a man 20 years her senior – in a low-key ceremony at Caxton Hall in London on February 21, 1952. She had first met him in 1948 while filming &quot;The Conspirator&quot; in England, and their relationship began when she returned to film &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; in 1951. Taylor found their age gap appealing. She wanted &quot;the calm and quiet and security of friendship&quot; from their relationship; he hoped that the marriage would aid his career in Hollywood. They had two sons: Michael Howard (born January 6, 1953) and Christopher Edward (born February 27, 1955; Taylor&#x27;s 23rd birthday). As Taylor grew older and more confident in herself, she began to drift apart from Wilding, whose failing career was also a source of marital strife. When she was away filming &quot;Giant&quot; in 1955, gossip magazine &quot;Confidential&quot; caused a scandal by claiming that he had entertained strippers at their home. Taylor and Wilding announced their separation on July 18, 1956, and were divorced on January 26, 1957.

Taylor was three months pregnant when she married her third husband, theatre and film producer Mike Todd, in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico, on February 2, 1957. They had one daughter, Elizabeth &quot;Liza&quot; Frances (born August 6, 1957). Todd, known for publicity stunts, encouraged the media attention to their marriage; for example, in June 1957, he threw a birthday party at Madison Square Garden, which was attended by 18,000 guests and broadcast on CBS. His death in a plane crash on 22 March 1958, left Taylor devastated. She was comforted by a friend of hers and Todd&#x27;s, singer Eddie Fisher, with whom she soon began an affair. Fisher was still married to actress Debbie Reynolds. The affair resulted in a public scandal, with Taylor being branded a &quot;homewrecker.&quot; Taylor and Fisher were married at the Temple Beth Sholom in Las Vegas on May 12, 1959; she later stated that she married him only due to her grief.

While filming &quot;Cleopatra&quot; in Italy in 1962, Taylor began an affair with her co-star, Welsh actor Richard Burton, although Burton was also married. Rumors about the affair began to circulate in the press, and were confirmed by a paparazzi shot of them on a yacht in Ischia. According to sociologist Ellis Cashmore, the publication of the photograph was a &quot;turning point&quot;, beginning a new era in which it became difficult for celebrities to keep their personal lives separate from their public images. The scandal caused Taylor and Burton to be condemned for &quot;erotic vagrancy&quot; by the Vatican, with calls also in the US Congress to bar them from re-entering the country. Taylor was granted a divorce from Fisher on March 5, 1964, in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico, and married Burton 10 days later in a private ceremony at the Ritz-Carlton Montreal. Burton subsequently adopted Liza Todd and Maria McKeown (born 1961), a German orphan whose adoption process Taylor had begun while married to Fisher.

Dubbed &quot;Liz and Dick&quot; by the media, Taylor and Burton starred together in 11 films, and led a jet-set lifestyle, spending millions on &quot;furs, diamonds, paintings, designer clothes, travel, food, liquor, a yacht, and a jet.&quot; Sociologist Karen Sternheimer states that they &quot;became a cottage industry of speculation about their alleged life of excess. From reports of massive spending [...] affairs, and even an open marriage, the couple came to represent a new era of &#x27;gotcha&#x27; celebrity coverage, where the more personal the story, the better.&quot; They divorced for the first time in June 1974, but reconciled, and remarried in Kasane, Botswana, on 10 October 1975. The second marriage lasted less than a year, ending in divorce in July 1976. Taylor and Burton&#x27;s relationship was often referred to as the &quot;marriage of the century&quot; by the media, and she later stated, &quot;After Richard, the men in my life were just there to hold the coat, to open the door. All the men after Richard were really just company.&quot; Soon after her final divorce from Burton, Taylor met her sixth husband, John Warner, a Republican politician from Virginia. They were married on 4 December 1976, after which Taylor concentrated on working for his electoral campaign. Once Warner had been elected to the Senate, she started to find her life as a politician&#x27;s wife in Washington, D.C. boring and lonely, becoming depressed, overweight, and increasingly addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol. Taylor and Warner separated in December 1981, and divorced on 5 November 1982.

After the divorce from Warner, Taylor dated actors Anthony Geary and George Hamilton, and was engaged to Mexican lawyer Victor Luna in 1983–1984, and New York businessman Dennis Stein in 1985. She met her seventh and last husband, construction worker Larry Fortensky, at the Betty Ford Center in 1988. They were married at the Neverland Ranch of her close friend Michael Jackson on October 6, 1991. The wedding was again subject to intense media attention, with one photographer parachuting to the ranch and Taylor selling the wedding pictures to &quot;People&quot; for $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ), which she used to start her AIDS foundation. Taylor and Fortensky divorced on October 31, 1996, but remained in contact for life. She attributed the split to her painful hip operations and his obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the winter of 1999, Fortensky underwent brain surgery after falling off a balcony and was comatose for six weeks; Taylor immediately notified the hospital she would personally guarantee his medical expenses. At the end of 2010, she wrote him a letter that read: &quot;You’re a part of my life that cannot be carved out nor do I ever wish it to be.&quot; Taylor&#x27;s last phone call with Fortensky was on February 7, 2011, one day before she checked into the hospital for what turned out to be her final stay. He told her she would outlive him. Although they had been divorced for almost 15 years, Taylor left Fortensky $825,000 in her will.

In the last years of her life, she had a platonic friendship with the actor Colin Farrell. On the phone, they often talked about the topic of insomnia and how to deal with it.

===Judaism===
Taylor was raised as a Christian Scientist, and converted to Judaism in 1959. Although two of her husbands – Mike Todd and Eddie Fisher – were Jewish, Taylor stated that she did not convert because of them, and had wanted to do so &quot;for a long time&quot;, and that there was &quot;comfort and dignity and hope for me in this ancient religion that [has] survived for four thousand years... I feel as if I have been a Jew all my life.&quot; Walker believed that Taylor was influenced in her decision by her godfather, Victor Cazalet, and her mother, who were active supporters of Zionism during her childhood.

Following her conversion, Taylor became an active supporter of Jewish and Zionist causes. In 1959, she purchased $100,000 worth of Israeli bonds, which led to her films being banned by Arab countries throughout the Middle East and Africa. She was also barred from entering Egypt to film &quot;Cleopatra&quot; in 1962, but the ban was lifted two years later after the Egyptian officials deemed that the film brought positive publicity for the country. In addition to purchasing bonds, Taylor helped to raise money for organizations such as the Jewish National Fund, and sat on the board of trustees of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

Taylor also advocated for the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel, cancelled a visit to the USSR because of its condemnation of Israel due to the Six-Day War, and signed a letter protesting the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 of 1975. In 1976, she offered herself as a replacement hostage after more than 100 Israeli civilians were taken hostage in the Entebbe skyjacking. She had a small role in the television film made about the incident, &quot;Victory at Entebbe&quot; (1976), and narrated &quot;Genocide&quot; (1981), an Academy Award-winning documentary about the Holocaust.

===Style and jewelry collection===
Taylor is considered a fashion icon both for her film costumes and personal style. At MGM, her costumes were mostly designed by Helen Rose and Edith Head, and in the 1960s by Irene Sharaff. Her most famous costumes include a white ball gown in &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951), a Grecian dress in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1958), a green A-line dress in &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot; (1959), and a slip and a fur coat in &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot; (1960). Her look in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963) started a trend for &quot;cat-eye&quot; makeup done with black eyeliner.

Taylor collected jewelry through her life, and owned the Krupp Diamond, the Taylor-Burton Diamond, and the La Peregrina Pearl, all three of which were gifts from husband Richard Burton. She also published a book about her collection, &quot;My Love Affair with Jewelry&quot;, in 2002. Taylor helped to popularise the work of fashion designers Valentino Garavani and Halston. She received a Lifetime of Glamour Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) in 1997. After her death, her jewelry and fashion collections were auctioned by Christie&#x27;s to benefit her AIDS foundation, ETAF. The jewelry sold for a record-breaking sum of $156.8 million, and the clothes and accessories for a further $5.5 million.

===Illness and death===
Taylor struggled with health problems for most of her life. She was born with scoliosis and broke her back while filming &quot;National Velvet&quot; in 1944. The fracture went undetected for several years, although it caused her chronic back problems. In 1956, she underwent an operation in which some of her spinal discs were removed and replaced with donated bone. Taylor was also prone to other illnesses and injuries, which often necessitated surgery; in 1961, she survived a near-fatal bout of pneumonia that required a tracheotomy.
She was treated for the pneumonia with bacteriophage.
In 1968 she underwent an emergency hysterectomy, which exacerbated her back problems and contributed to hip problems. Perhaps self-medicating, she was addicted to alcohol and prescription pain killers and tranquilizers. She was treated at the Betty Ford Center for seven weeks from December 1983 to January 1984, becoming the first celebrity to openly admit herself to the clinic. She relapsed later in the decade and entered rehabilitation again in 1988. Taylor also struggled with her weight – she became overweight in the 1970s, especially after her marriage to Senator John Warner, and published a diet book about her experiences, &quot;Elizabeth Takes Off&quot; (1988). Taylor was a heavy smoker until she experienced a severe bout of pneumonia in 1990.

Taylor&#x27;s health increasingly declined during the last two decades of her life and she rarely attended public events after 1996. Taylor had serious bouts of pneumonia in 1990 and 2000, two hip replacement surgeries in the mid-1990s, a surgery for a benign brain tumor in 1997, and successful treatment for skin cancer in 2002. She used a wheelchair due to her back problems and was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 2004. She died of the illness aged 79 on March 23, 2011, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, six weeks after being hospitalized. Her funeral took place the following day at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. The service was a private Jewish ceremony presided by Rabbi Jerome Cutler. At Taylor&#x27;s request, the ceremony began 15 minutes behind schedule, as, according to her representative, &quot;She even wanted to be late for her own funeral.&quot; She was entombed in the cemetery&#x27;s Great Mausoleum.

===Los Angeles residence===
Taylor lived at 700 Nimes Road in the Bel Air district of Los Angeles from 1982 until her death in 2011. The art photographer Catherine Opie created an eponymous photographic study of the house in 2011.

==Legacy==
Taylor was one of the last stars of classical Hollywood cinema and one of the first modern celebrities. During the era of the studio system, she exemplified the classic film star. She was portrayed as different from &quot;ordinary&quot; people, and her public image was carefully crafted and controlled by MGM. When the era of classical Hollywood ended in the 1960s, and paparazzi photography became a normal feature of media culture, Taylor came to define a new type of celebrity whose real private life was the focus of public interest. &quot;More than for any film role,&quot; Adam Bernstein of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;she became famous for being famous, setting a media template for later generations of entertainers, models, and all variety of semi-somebodies.&quot;

Regardless of the acting awards she won during her career, Taylor&#x27;s film performances were often overlooked by contemporary critics; according to film historian Jeanine Basinger, &quot;No actress ever had a more difficult job in getting critics to accept her onscreen as someone other than Elizabeth Taylor... Her persona ate her alive.&quot; Her film roles often mirrored her personal life, and many critics continue to regard her as always playing herself, rather than acting. In contrast, Mel Gussow of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;the range of [Taylor&#x27;s] acting was surprisingly wide&quot;, despite the fact that she never received any professional training. Film critic Peter Bradshaw called her &quot;an actress of such sexiness it was an incitement to riot – sultry and queenly at the same time&quot;, and &quot;a shrewd, intelligent, intuitive acting presence in her later years.&quot; David Thomson stated that &quot;she had the range, nerve, and instinct that only Bette Davis had had before – and like Davis, Taylor was monster and empress, sweetheart and scold, idiot and wise woman.&quot; Five films in which she starred – &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot;, &quot;National Velvet&quot;, &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;, &quot;Giant&quot;, and &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; – have been preserved in the National Film Registry, and the American Film Institute has named her the seventh greatest female screen legend of classical Hollywood cinema.

Taylor has also been discussed by journalists and scholars interested in the role of women in Western society. Camille Paglia writes that Taylor was a &quot;pre-feminist woman&quot; who &quot;wields the sexual power that feminism cannot explain and has tried to destroy. Through stars like Taylor, we sense the world-disordering impact of legendary women like Delilah, Salome, and Helen of Troy.&quot; In contrast, cultural critic M.G. Lord calls Taylor an &quot;accidental feminist&quot;, stating that while she did not identify as a feminist, many of her films had feminist themes and &quot;introduced a broad audience to feminist ideas.&quot; Similarly, Ben W. Heineman Jr. and Cristine Russell write in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that her role in &quot;Giant&quot; &quot;dismantled stereotypes about women and minorities.&quot;

Taylor is considered a gay icon, and received widespread recognition for her HIV/AIDS activism. After her death, GLAAD issued a statement saying that she &quot;was an icon not only in Hollywood, but in the LGBT community, where she worked to ensure that everyone was treated with the respect and dignity we all deserve&quot;, and Sir Nick Partridge of the Terrence Higgins Trust called her &quot;the first major star to publicly fight fear and prejudice towards AIDS.&quot; According to Paul Flynn of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she was &quot;a new type of gay icon, one whose position is based not on tragedy, but on her work for the LGBTQ community.&quot; Speaking of her charity work, former President Bill Clinton said at her death, &quot;Elizabeth&#x27;s legacy will live on in many people around the world whose lives will be longer and better because of her work and the ongoing efforts of those she inspired.&quot;

Since Taylor&#x27;s death, House of Taylor, Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s estate, has preserved Taylor&#x27;s legacy through content, partnerships, and products. The estate is managed by three trustees selected by Elizabeth prior to her death. They continue to be involved with The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation and oversee The Elizabeth Taylor Archive.

In 2022, House of Taylor released &quot;Elizabeth The First&quot;, a 10-part podcast series with Imperative Entertainment and Kitty Purry Productions and narrated by Katy Perry. In December 2022, &quot;Elizabeth Taylor: The Grit &amp; Glamour of an Icon&quot; by Kate Andersen Brower, the first Elizabeth Taylor biography authorized by the estate, was released.

In 2019, it was announced that Rachel Weisz would portray Taylor in &quot;A Special Relationship&quot;, an upcoming film about Taylor&#x27;s journey from actress to activist written by Simon Beaufoy.

In 2024, it was announced that Kim Kardashian would executive produce and feature in a docuseries about Taylor. Commissioned by the BBC, it&#x27;s been given the working title &quot;Elizabeth Taylor: Rebel Superstar&quot;.
