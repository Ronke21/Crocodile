<text>Fluorite (also called fluorspar) is the mineral form of calcium fluoride, CaF2. It belongs to the halide minerals. It crystallizes in isometric cubic habit, although octahedral and more complex isometric forms are not uncommon.

The Mohs scale of mineral hardness, based on scratch hardness comparison, defines value 4 as fluorite.

Pure fluorite is colourless and transparent, both in visible and ultraviolet light, but impurities usually make it a colorful mineral and the stone has ornamental and lapidary uses. Industrially, fluorite is used as a flux for smelting, and in the production of certain glasses and enamels. The purest grades of fluorite are a source of fluoride for hydrofluoric acid manufacture, which is the intermediate source of most fluorine-containing fine chemicals. Optically clear transparent fluorite has anomalous partial dispersion, that is, its refractive index varies with the wavelength of light in a manner that differs from that of commonly used glasses, so fluorite is useful in making apochromatic lenses, and particularly valuable in photographic optics. Fluorite optics are also usable in the far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared ranges, where conventional glasses are too opaque for use. Fluorite also has low dispersion, and a high refractive index for its density.

==History and etymology==

The word &quot;fluorite&quot; is derived from the Latin verb &quot;fluere&quot;, meaning &quot;to flow&quot;. The mineral is used as a flux in iron smelting to decrease the viscosity of slag. The term &quot;flux&quot; comes from the Latin adjective &quot;fluxus&quot;, meaning &quot;flowing, loose, slack&quot;. The mineral fluorite was originally termed fluorspar and was first discussed in print in a 1530 work &quot;Bermannvs sive de re metallica dialogus&quot; [Bermannus; or dialogue about the nature of metals], by Georgius Agricola, as a mineral noted for its usefulness as a flux. Agricola, a German scientist with expertise in philology, mining, and metallurgy, named fluorspar as a Neo-Latinization of the German &quot;Flussspat&quot; from &quot;Fluss&quot; (stream, river) and &quot;Spat&quot; (meaning a nonmetallic mineral akin to gypsum, spærstān, &quot;spear stone&quot;, referring to its crystalline projections).

In 1852, fluorite gave its name to the phenomenon of fluorescence, which is prominent in fluorites from certain locations, due to certain impurities in the crystal. Fluorite also gave the name to its constitutive element fluorine. Currently, the word &quot;fluorspar&quot; is most commonly used for fluorite as an industrial and chemical commodity, while &quot;fluorite&quot; is used mineralogically and in most other senses.

In archeology, gemmology, classical studies, and Egyptology, the Latin terms &quot;murrina&quot; and &quot;myrrhina&quot; refer to fluorite. In book 37 of his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;, Pliny the Elder describes it as a precious stone with purple and white mottling, and noted that the Romans prized objects carved from it. It has been suggested that the Sanskrit mineral name &quot;vaikrānta&quot; (वैक्रान्तः), known from Sanskrit alchemical texts dating from the early second millennium CE onwards, may refer to fluorite.

==Structure==

Fluorite crystallizes in a cubic motif. Crystal twinning is common and adds complexity to the observed crystal habits. Fluorite has four perfect cleavage planes that help produce octahedral fragments. The structural motif adopted by fluorite is so common that the motif is called the fluorite structure. Element substitution for the calcium cation often includes strontium and certain rare-earth elements (REE), such as yttrium and cerium.

==Occurrence and mining==

Fluorite forms as a late-crystallizing mineral in felsic igneous rocks typically through hydrothermal activity. It is particularly common in granitic pegmatites. It may occur as a vein deposit formed through hydrothermal activity particularly in limestones. In such vein deposits it can be associated with galena, sphalerite, barite, quartz, and calcite. Fluorite can also be found as a constituent of sedimentary rocks either as grains or as the cementing material in sandstone.

It is a common mineral mainly distributed in South Africa, China, Mexico, Mongolia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Tanzania, Rwanda and Argentina.

The world reserves of fluorite are estimated at 230 million tonnes (Mt) with the largest deposits being in South Africa (about 41 Mt), Mexico (32 Mt) and China (24 Mt). China is leading the world production with about 3 Mt annually (in 2010), followed by Mexico (1.0 Mt), Mongolia (0.45 Mt), Russia (0.22 Mt), South Africa (0.13 Mt), Spain (0.12 Mt) and Namibia (0.11 Mt).

One of the largest deposits of fluorspar in North America is located on the Burin Peninsula, Newfoundland, Canada. The first official recognition of fluorspar in the area was recorded by geologist J.B. Jukes in 1843. He noted an occurrence of &quot;galena&quot; or lead ore and fluoride of lime on the west side of St. Lawrence harbour. It is recorded that interest in the commercial mining of fluorspar began in 1928 with the first ore being extracted in 1933. Eventually, at Iron Springs Mine, the shafts reached depths of . In the St. Lawrence area, the veins are persistent for great lengths and several of them have wide lenses. The area with veins of known workable size comprises about . 

In 2018, Canada Fluorspar Inc. commenced mine production again in St. Lawrence; in spring 2019, the company was planned to develop a new shipping port on the west side of Burin Peninsula as a more affordable means of moving their product to markets, and they successfully sent the first shipload of ore from the new port on July 31, 2021. This marks the first time in 30 years that ore has been shipped directly out of St. Lawrence.

Cubic crystals up to 20 cm across have been found at Dalnegorsk, Russia. The largest documented single crystal of fluorite was a cube 2.12 meters in size and weighing approximately 16 tonnes. 

In Asturias (Spain) there are several fluorite deposits known internationally for the quality of the specimens they have yielded. In the area of Berbes, Ribadesella, fluorite appears as cubic crystals, sometimes with dodecahedron modifications, which can reach a size of up to 10 cm of edge, with internal colour zoning, almost always violet in colour. It is associated with quartz and leafy aggregates of baryte. In the &quot;Emilio&quot; mine, in Loroñe, Colunga, the fluorite crystals, cubes with small modifications of other figures, are colourless and transparent. They can reach 10 cm of edge. In the &quot;Moscona&quot; mine, in Villabona, the fluorite crystals, cubic without modifications of other shapes, are yellow, up to 3 cm of edge. They are associated with large crystals of calcite and barite.

===&quot;Blue John&quot;===

One of the most famous of the older-known localities of fluorite is Castleton in Derbyshire, England, where, under the name of &quot;Derbyshire Blue John&quot;, purple-blue fluorite was extracted from several mines or caves. During the 19th century, this attractive fluorite was mined for its ornamental value. The mineral Blue John is now scarce, and only a few hundred kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and lapidary use. Mining still takes place in Blue John Cavern and Treak Cliff Cavern.

Recently discovered deposits in China have produced fluorite with coloring and banding similar to the classic Blue John stone.

==Fluorescence==

George Gabriel Stokes named the phenomenon of &quot;fluorescence&quot; from fluorite, in 1852.

Many samples of fluorite exhibit fluorescence under ultraviolet light, a property that takes its name from fluorite. Many minerals, as well as other substances, fluoresce. Fluorescence involves the elevation of electron energy levels by quanta of ultraviolet light, followed by the progressive falling back of the electrons into their previous energy state, releasing quanta of visible light in the process. In fluorite, the visible light emitted is most commonly blue, but red, purple, yellow, green, and white also occur. The fluorescence of fluorite may be due to mineral impurities, such as yttrium and ytterbium, or organic matter, such as volatile hydrocarbons in the crystal lattice. In particular, the blue fluorescence seen in fluorites from certain parts of Great Britain responsible for the naming of the phenomenon of fluorescence itself, has been attributed to the presence of inclusions of divalent europium in the crystal. Natural samples containing rare earth impurities such as erbium have also been observed to display upconversion fluorescence, in which infrared light stimulates emission of visible light, a phenomenon usually only reported in synthetic materials.

One fluorescent variety of fluorite is chlorophane, which is reddish or purple in color and fluoresces brightly in emerald green when heated (thermoluminescence), or when illuminated with ultraviolet light.

The color of visible light emitted when a sample of fluorite is fluorescing depends on where the original specimen was collected; different impurities having been included in the crystal lattice in different places. Neither does all fluorite fluoresce equally brightly, even from the same locality. Therefore, ultraviolet light is not a reliable tool for the identification of specimens, nor for quantifying the mineral in mixtures. For example, among British fluorites, those from Northumberland, County Durham, and eastern Cumbria are the most consistently fluorescent, whereas fluorite from Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Cornwall, if they fluoresce at all, are generally only feebly fluorescent.

Fluorite also exhibits the property of thermoluminescence.
==Color==
Fluorite is allochromatic, meaning that it can be tinted with elemental impurities. Fluorite comes in a wide range of colors and has consequently been dubbed &quot;the most colorful mineral in the world&quot;. Every color of the rainbow in various shades is represented by fluorite samples, along with white, black, and clear crystals. The most common colors are purple, blue, green, yellow, or colorless. Less common are pink, red, white, brown, and black. Color zoning or banding is commonly present. The color of the fluorite is determined by factors including impurities, exposure to radiation, and the absence of voids of the color centers.

==Uses==

===Source of fluorine and fluoride===
Fluorite is a major source of hydrogen fluoride, a commodity chemical used to produce a wide range of materials. Hydrogen fluoride is liberated from the mineral by the action of concentrated sulfuric acid:
:CaF2(s) + H2SO4 → CaSO4(s) + 2 HF(g)

The resulting HF is converted into fluorine, fluorocarbons, and diverse fluoride materials. As of the late 1990s, five billion kilograms were mined annually.

There are three principal types of industrial use for natural fluorite, commonly referred to as &quot;fluorspar&quot; in these industries, corresponding to different grades of purity. Metallurgical grade fluorite (60–85% CaF2), the lowest of the three grades, has traditionally been used as a flux to lower the melting point of raw materials in steel production to aid the removal of impurities, and later in the production of aluminium. Ceramic grade fluorite (85–95% CaF2) is used in the manufacture of opalescent glass, enamels, and cooking utensils. The highest grade, &quot;acid grade fluorite&quot; (97% or more CaF2), accounts for about 95% of fluorite consumption in the US where it is used to make hydrogen fluoride and hydrofluoric acid by reacting the fluorite with sulfuric acid.

Internationally, acid-grade fluorite is also used in the production of AlF3 and cryolite (Na3AlF6), which are the main fluorine compounds used in aluminium smelting. Alumina is dissolved in a bath that consists primarily of molten Na3AlF6, AlF3, and fluorite (CaF2) to allow electrolytic recovery of aluminium. Fluorine losses are replaced entirely by the addition of AlF3, the majority of which react with excess sodium from the alumina to form Na3AlF6.

===Niche uses===
====Lapidary uses====
Natural fluorite mineral has ornamental and lapidary uses. Fluorite may be drilled into beads and used in jewelry, although due to its relative softness it is not widely used as a semiprecious stone. It is also used for ornamental carvings, with expert carvings taking advantage of the stone&#x27;s zonation.

====Optics====

In the laboratory, calcium fluoride is commonly used as a window material for both infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths, since it is transparent in these regions (about 150 to 9000 nm) and exhibits an extremely low change in refractive index with wavelength. Furthermore, the material is attacked by few reagents. At wavelengths as short as 157 nm, a common wavelength used for semiconductor stepper manufacture for integrated circuit lithography, the refractive index of calcium fluoride shows some non-linearity at high power densities, which has inhibited its use for this purpose. In the early years of the 21st century, the stepper market for calcium fluoride collapsed, and many large manufacturing facilities have been closed. Canon and other manufacturers have used synthetically grown crystals of calcium fluoride components in lenses to aid apochromatic design, and to reduce light dispersion. This use has largely been superseded by newer glasses and computer-aided design. As an infrared optical material, calcium fluoride is widely available and was sometimes known by the Eastman Kodak trademarked name &quot;Irtran-3&quot;, although this designation is obsolete.

Fluorite should not be confused with fluoro-crown (or fluorine crown) glass, a type of low-dispersion glass that has special optical properties approaching fluorite. True fluorite is not a glass but a crystalline material. Lenses or optical groups made using this low dispersion glass as one or more elements exhibit less chromatic aberration than those utilizing conventional, less expensive crown glass and flint glass elements to make an achromatic lens. Optical groups employ a combination of different types of glass; each type of glass refracts light in a different way. By using combinations of different types of glass, lens manufacturers are able to cancel out or significantly reduce unwanted characteristics; chromatic aberration being the most important. The best of such lens designs are often called apochromatic (see above). Fluoro-crown glass (such as Schott FK51) usually in combination with an appropriate &quot;flint&quot; glass (such as Schott KzFSN 2) can give very high performance in telescope objective lenses, as well as microscope objectives, and camera telephoto lenses. Fluorite elements are similarly paired with complementary &quot;flint&quot; elements (such as Schott LaK 10). The refractive qualities of fluorite and of certain flint elements provide a lower and more uniform dispersion across the spectrum of visible light, thereby keeping colors focused more closely together. Lenses made with fluorite are superior to fluoro-crown based lenses, at least for doublet telescope objectives; but are more difficult to produce and more costly.

The use of fluorite for prisms and lenses was studied and promoted by Victor Schumann near the end of the 19th century. Naturally occurring fluorite crystals without optical defects were only large enough to produce microscope objectives.

With the advent of synthetically grown fluorite crystals in the 1950s - 60s, it could be used instead of glass in some high-performance optical telescope and camera lens elements. In telescopes, fluorite elements allow high-resolution images of astronomical objects at high magnifications. Canon Inc. produces synthetic fluorite crystals that are used in their better telephoto lenses. The use of fluorite for telescope lenses has declined since the 1990s, as newer designs using fluoro-crown glass, including triplets, have offered comparable performance at lower prices. Fluorite and various combinations of fluoride compounds can be made into synthetic crystals which have applications in lasers and special optics for UV and infrared.

Exposure tools for the semiconductor industry make use of fluorite optical elements for ultraviolet light at wavelengths of about 157 nanometers. Fluorite has a uniquely high transparency at this wavelength. Fluorite objective lenses are manufactured by the larger microscope firms (Nikon, Olympus, Carl Zeiss and Leica). Their transparence to ultraviolet light enables them to be used for fluorescence microscopy. The fluorite also serves to correct optical aberrations in these lenses. Nikon has previously manufactured at least one fluorite and synthetic quartz element camera lens (105 mm f/4.5 UV) for the production of ultraviolet images. Konica produced a fluorite lens for their SLR cameras – the Hexanon 300 mm f/6.3.

==Source of fluorine gas in nature==
In 2012, the first source of naturally occurring fluorine gas was found in fluorite mines in Bavaria, Germany. It was previously thought that fluorine gas did not occur naturally because it is so reactive, and would rapidly react with other chemicals. Fluorite is normally colorless, but some varied forms found nearby look black, and are known as &#x27;fetid fluorite&#x27; or antozonite. The minerals, containing small amounts of uranium and its daughter products, release radiation sufficiently energetic to induce oxidation of fluoride anions within the structure, to fluorine that becomes trapped inside the mineral. The color of fetid fluorite is predominantly due to the calcium atoms remaining. Solid-state fluorine-19 NMR carried out on the gas contained in the antozonite, revealed a peak at 425 ppm, which is consistent with F2.

<text>Flux describes any effect that appears to pass or travel (whether it actually moves or not) through a surface or substance. Flux is a concept in applied mathematics and vector calculus which has many applications in physics. For transport phenomena, flux is a vector quantity, describing the magnitude and direction of the flow of a substance or property. In vector calculus flux is a scalar quantity, defined as the surface integral of the perpendicular component of a vector field over a surface.

== Terminology ==
The word &quot;flux&quot; comes from Latin: &quot;fluxus&quot; means &quot;flow&quot;, and &quot;fluere&quot; is &quot;to flow&quot;. As &quot;fluxion&quot;, this term was introduced into differential calculus by Isaac Newton.

The concept of heat flux was a key contribution of Joseph Fourier, in the analysis of heat transfer phenomena. His seminal treatise &quot;Théorie analytique de la chaleur&quot; (&quot;The Analytical Theory of Heat&quot;), defines &quot;fluxion&quot; as a central quantity and proceeds to derive the now well-known expressions of flux in terms of temperature differences across a slab, and then more generally in terms of temperature gradients or differentials of temperature, across other geometries. One could argue, based on the work of James Clerk Maxwell, that the transport definition precedes the definition of flux used in electromagnetism. The specific quote from Maxwell is:
According to the transport definition, flux may be a single vector, or it may be a vector field / function of position. In the latter case flux can readily be integrated over a surface. By contrast, according to the electromagnetism definition, flux &quot;is&quot; the integral over a surface; it makes no sense to integrate a second-definition flux for one would be integrating over a surface twice. Thus, Maxwell&#x27;s quote only makes sense if &quot;flux&quot; is being used according to the transport definition (and furthermore is a vector field rather than single vector). This is ironic because Maxwell was one of the major developers of what we now call &quot;electric flux&quot; and &quot;magnetic flux&quot; according to the electromagnetism definition. Their names in accordance with the quote (and transport definition) would be &quot;surface integral of electric flux&quot; and &quot;surface integral of magnetic flux&quot;, in which case &quot;electric flux&quot; would instead be defined as &quot;electric field&quot; and &quot;magnetic flux&quot; defined as &quot;magnetic field&quot;. This implies that Maxwell conceived of these fields as flows/fluxes of some sort.

Given a flux according to the electromagnetism definition, the corresponding flux density, if that term is used, refers to its derivative along the surface that was integrated. By the Fundamental theorem of calculus, the corresponding flux density is a flux according to the transport definition. Given a current such as electric current—charge per time, current density would also be a flux according to the transport definition—charge per time per area. Due to the conflicting definitions of &quot;flux&quot;, and the interchangeability of &quot;flux&quot;, &quot;flow&quot;, and &quot;current&quot; in nontechnical English, all of the terms used in this paragraph are sometimes used interchangeably and ambiguously. Concrete fluxes in the rest of this article will be used in accordance to their broad acceptance in the literature, regardless of which definition of flux the term corresponds to.

== Flux as flow rate per unit area ==
In transport phenomena (heat transfer, mass transfer and fluid dynamics), flux is defined as the &quot;rate of flow of a property per unit area&quot;, which has the dimensions [quantity]·[time]−1·[area]−1. The area is of the surface the property is flowing &quot;through&quot; or &quot;across&quot;. For example, the amount of water that flows through a cross section of a river each second divided by the area of that cross section, or the amount of sunlight energy that lands on a patch of ground each second divided by the area of the patch, are kinds of flux.

=== General mathematical definition (transport) ===
Here are 3 definitions in increasing order of complexity. Each is a special case of the following. In all cases the frequent symbol &quot;j&quot;, (or &quot;J&quot;) is used for flux, &quot;q&quot; for the physical quantity that flows, &quot;t&quot; for time, and &quot;A&quot; for area. These identifiers will be written in bold when and only when they are vectors.

First, flux as a (single) scalar:
formula_1
where
formula_2
In this case the surface in which flux is being measured is fixed and has area &quot;A&quot;. The surface is assumed to be flat, and the flow is assumed to be everywhere constant with respect to position and perpendicular to the surface.

Second, flux as a scalar field defined along a surface, i.e. a function of points on the surface:
formula_3
formula_4
As before, the surface is assumed to be flat, and the flow is assumed to be everywhere perpendicular to it. However the flow need not be constant. &quot;q&quot; is now a function of p, a point on the surface, and &quot;A&quot;, an area. Rather than measure the total flow through the surface, &quot;q&quot; measures the flow through the disk with area &quot;A&quot; centered at &quot;p&quot; along the surface.

Finally, flux as a vector field:
formula_5
formula_6
In this case, there is no fixed surface we are measuring over. &quot;q&quot; is a function of a point, an area, and a direction (given by a unit vector formula_7), and measures the flow through the disk of area A perpendicular to that unit vector. &quot;I&quot; is defined picking the unit vector that maximizes the flow around the point, because the true flow is maximized across the disk that is perpendicular to it. The unit vector thus uniquely maximizes the function when it points in the &quot;true direction&quot; of the flow. (Strictly speaking, this is an abuse of notation because the &quot;argmax&quot; cannot directly compare vectors; we take the vector with the biggest norm instead.)

==== Properties ====

These direct definitions, especially the last, are rather unwieldy. For example, the argmax construction is artificial from the perspective of empirical measurements, when with a weathervane or similar one can easily deduce the direction of flux at a point. Rather than defining the vector flux directly, it is often more intuitive to state some properties about it. Furthermore, from these properties the flux can uniquely be determined anyway.

If the flux j passes through the area at an angle θ to the area normal formula_7, then the dot product
formula_9
That is, the component of flux passing through the surface (i.e. normal to it) is &quot;j&quot;cos&quot;θ&quot;, while the component of flux passing tangential to the area is &quot;j&quot;sin&quot;θ&quot;, but there is &quot;no&quot; flux actually passing &quot;through&quot; the area in the tangential direction. The &quot;only&quot; component of flux passing normal to the area is the cosine component.

For vector flux, the surface integral of j over a surface &quot;S&quot;, gives the proper flowing per unit of time through the surface:
formula_10
where A (and its infinitesimal) is the vector area combination formula_11 of the magnitude of the area &quot;A&quot; through which the property passes and a unit vector formula_7 normal to the area.
Unlike in the second set of equations, the surface here need not be flat.

Finally, we can integrate again over the time duration &quot;t&quot;1 to &quot;t&quot;2, getting the total amount of the property flowing through the surface in that time (&quot;t&quot;2 − &quot;t&quot;1):
formula_13

=== Transport fluxes ===
Eight of the most common forms of flux from the transport phenomena literature are defined as follows:
# Momentum flux, the rate of transfer of momentum across a unit area (N·s·m−2·s−1). (Newton&#x27;s law of viscosity)
# Heat flux, the rate of heat flow across a unit area (J·m−2·s−1). (Fourier&#x27;s law of conduction) (This definition of heat flux fits Maxwell&#x27;s original definition.)
# Diffusion flux, the rate of movement of molecules across a unit area (mol·m−2·s−1). (Fick&#x27;s law of diffusion)
# Volumetric flux, the rate of volume flow across a unit area (m3·m−2·s−1). (Darcy&#x27;s law of groundwater flow)
# Mass flux, the rate of mass flow across a unit area (kg·m−2·s−1). (Either an alternate form of Fick&#x27;s law that includes the molecular mass, or an alternate form of Darcy&#x27;s law that includes the density.)
# Radiative flux, the amount of energy transferred in the form of photons at a certain distance from the source per unit area per second (J·m−2·s−1). Used in astronomy to determine the magnitude and spectral class of a star. Also acts as a generalization of heat flux, which is equal to the radiative flux when restricted to the electromagnetic spectrum.
# Energy flux, the rate of transfer of energy through a unit area (J·m−2·s−1). The radiative flux and heat flux are specific cases of energy flux.
# Particle flux, the rate of transfer of particles through a unit area ([number of particles] m−2·s−1)

These fluxes are vectors at each point in space, and have a definite magnitude and direction. Also, one can take the divergence of any of these fluxes to determine the accumulation rate of the quantity in a control volume around a given point in space. For incompressible flow, the divergence of the volume flux is zero.

==== Chemical diffusion ====
As mentioned above, chemical molar flux of a component A in an isothermal, isobaric system is defined in Fick&#x27;s law of diffusion as:
formula_14
where the nabla symbol ∇ denotes the gradient operator, &quot;DAB&quot; is the diffusion coefficient (m2·s−1) of component A diffusing through component B, &quot;cA&quot; is the concentration (mol/m3) of component A.

This flux has units of mol·m−2·s−1, and fits Maxwell&#x27;s original definition of flux.

For dilute gases, kinetic molecular theory relates the diffusion coefficient &quot;D&quot; to the particle density &quot;n&quot; = &quot;N&quot;/&quot;V&quot;, the molecular mass &quot;m&quot;, the collision cross section formula_15, and the absolute temperature &quot;T&quot; by
formula_16
where the second factor is the mean free path and the square root (with the Boltzmann constant &quot;k&quot;) is the mean velocity of the particles.

In turbulent flows, the transport by eddy motion can be expressed as a grossly increased diffusion coefficient.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
In quantum mechanics, particles of mass &quot;m&quot; in the quantum state &quot;ψ&quot;(r, &quot;t&quot;) have a probability density defined as
formula_17
So the probability of finding a particle in a differential volume element d3r is
formula_18
Then the number of particles passing perpendicularly through unit area of a cross-section per unit time is the probability flux;
formula_19
This is sometimes referred to as the probability current or current density, or probability flux density.

== Flux as a surface integral ==
=== General mathematical definition (surface integral) ===

As a mathematical concept, flux is represented by the surface integral of a vector field,
formula_20
formula_21
where F is a vector field, and dA is the vector area of the surface &quot;A&quot;, directed as the surface normal. For the second, n is the outward pointed unit normal vector to the surface.

The surface has to be orientable, i.e. two sides can be distinguished: the surface does not fold back onto itself. Also, the surface has to be actually oriented, i.e. we use a convention as to flowing which way is counted positive; flowing backward is then counted negative.

The surface normal is usually directed by the right-hand rule.

Conversely, one can consider the flux the more fundamental quantity and call the vector field the flux density.

Often a vector field is drawn by curves (field lines) following the &quot;flow&quot;; the magnitude of the vector field is then the line density, and the flux through a surface is the number of lines. Lines originate from areas of positive divergence (sources) and end at areas of negative divergence (sinks).

See also the image at right: the number of red arrows passing through a unit area is the flux density, the curve encircling the red arrows denotes the boundary of the surface, and the orientation of the arrows with respect to the surface denotes the sign of the inner product of the vector field with the surface normals.

If the surface encloses a 3D region, usually the surface is oriented such that the influx is counted positive; the opposite is the outflux.

The divergence theorem states that the net outflux through a closed surface, in other words the net outflux from a 3D region, is found by adding the local net outflow from each point in the region (which is expressed by the divergence).

If the surface is not closed, it has an oriented curve as boundary. Stokes&#x27; theorem states that the flux of the curl of a vector field is the line integral of the vector field over this boundary. This path integral is also called circulation, especially in fluid dynamics. Thus the curl is the circulation density.

We can apply the flux and these theorems to many disciplines in which we see currents, forces, etc., applied through areas.

=== Electromagnetism ===

==== Electric flux ====

An electric &quot;charge&quot;, such as a single proton in space, has a magnitude defined in coulombs. Such a charge has an electric field surrounding it. In pictorial form, the electric field from a positive point charge can be visualized as a dot radiating electric field lines (sometimes also called &quot;lines of force&quot;). Conceptually, electric flux can be thought of as &quot;the number of field lines&quot; passing through a given area. Mathematically, electric flux is the integral of the normal component of the electric field over a given area. Hence, units of electric flux are, in the MKS system, newtons per coulomb times meters squared, or N m2/C. (Electric flux density is the electric flux per unit area, and is a measure of strength of the normal component of the electric field averaged over the area of integration. Its units are N/C, the same as the electric field in MKS units.)

Two forms of electric flux are used, one for the E-field:
and one for the D-field (called the electric displacement):

This quantity arises in Gauss&#x27;s law – which states that the flux of the electric field E out of a closed surface is proportional to the electric charge &quot;QA&quot; enclosed in the surface (independent of how that charge is distributed), the integral form is:
where &quot;ε&quot;0 is the permittivity of free space.

If one considers the flux of the electric field vector, E, for a tube near a point charge in the field of the charge but not containing it with sides formed by lines tangent to the field, the flux for the sides is zero and there is an equal and opposite flux at both ends of the tube. This is a consequence of Gauss&#x27;s Law applied to an inverse square field. The flux for any cross-sectional surface of the tube will be the same. The total flux for any surface surrounding a charge &quot;q&quot; is &quot;q&quot;/&quot;ε&quot;0.

In free space the electric displacement is given by the constitutive relation D = &quot;ε&quot;0 E, so for any bounding surface the D-field flux equals the charge &quot;QA&quot; within it. Here the expression &quot;flux of&quot; indicates a mathematical operation and, as can be seen, the result is not necessarily a &quot;flow&quot;, since nothing actually flows along electric field lines.

==== Magnetic flux ====
The magnetic flux density (magnetic field) having the unit Wb/m2 (Tesla) is denoted by B, and magnetic flux is defined analogously:
formula_22
with the same notation above. The quantity arises in Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, where the magnetic flux is time-dependent either because the boundary is time-dependent or magnetic field is time-dependent. In integral form:
formula_23
where &quot;d&quot;{{ell}} is an infinitesimal vector line element of the closed curve formula_24, with magnitude equal to the length of the infinitesimal line element, and direction given by the tangent to the curve formula_24, with the sign determined by the integration direction.

The time-rate of change of the magnetic flux through a loop of wire is minus the electromotive force created in that wire. The direction is such that if current is allowed to pass through the wire, the electromotive force will cause a current which &quot;opposes&quot; the change in magnetic field by itself producing a magnetic field opposite to the change. This is the basis for inductors and many electric generators.

==== Poynting flux ====
Using this definition, the flux of the Poynting vector S over a specified surface is the rate at which electromagnetic energy flows through that surface, defined like before:

: {{oiint
| preintegral = formula_26
| intsubscpt = formula_27
| integrand = formula_28

The flux of the Poynting vector through a surface is the electromagnetic power, or energy per unit time, passing through that surface. This is commonly used in analysis of electromagnetic radiation, but has application to other electromagnetic systems as well.

Confusingly, the Poynting vector is sometimes called the &quot;power flux&quot;, which is an example of the first usage of flux, above. It has units of watts per square metre (W/m2).

<doc id="43591" wikidata="Q274223" url="?curid=43591" title="Édouard Roche">
<text>Édouard Albert Roche (; 17 October 1820 – 27 April 1883) was a French astronomer and mathematician, who is best known for his work in the field of celestial mechanics. His name was given to the concepts of the Roche sphere, Roche limit, and Roche lobe. He also was the author of works in meteorology.

== Biography ==
He was born in Montpellier, and studied at the University of Montpellier, receiving his D.Sc. in 1844 and later becoming a professor at the same institution, where he served in the Faculté des Sciences starting in 1849. Roche made a mathematical study of Laplace&#x27;s nebular hypothesis and presented his results in a series of papers to the Academy of Montpellier from his appointment until 1877. The most important were on comets (1860) and the nebular hypothesis itself (1873). Roche&#x27;s studies examined the effects of strong gravitational fields upon swarms of tiny particles.

He is perhaps most famous for his theory that the planetary rings of Saturn were formed when a large icy moon came too close to Saturn and was pulled apart by gravitational forces. He described a method of calculating the distance at which an object held together only by gravity would break up due to tidal forces; this distance became known as the Roche limit.

His other best known works also involved orbital mechanics. The Roche sphere describes the limits at which an object which is in orbit around two other objects will be captured by one or the other, and the Roche lobe approximates the gravitational sphere of influence of one astronomical body in the face of perturbations from another heavier body around which it orbits.

Roche&#x27;s works were not appreciated during his lifetime. In 1883 he was proposed for full membership to the French Academy of Sciences. However, he only received a single vote out of 56. He died of pneumonia two days later, unaware that his membership had been declined.

== Works ==
Roche&#x27;s works are in French, his vernacular language.

<doc id="43592" wikidata="Q14278" url="?curid=43592" title="John Herschel">
<text>Sir John Frederick William Herschel, 1st Baronet (; 7 March 1792 – 11 May 1871) was an English polymath active as a mathematician, astronomer, chemist, inventor and experimental photographer who invented the blueprint and did botanical work.

Herschel originated the use of the Julian day system in astronomy. He named seven moons of Saturn and four moons of Uranus – the seventh planet, discovered by his father Sir William Herschel. He made many contributions to the science of photography, and investigated colour blindness and the chemical power of ultraviolet rays. His &quot;Preliminary Discourse&quot; (1831), which advocated an inductive approach to scientific experiment and theory-building, was an important contribution to the philosophy of science.

== Early life and work on astronomy ==

Herschel was born in Slough, Buckinghamshire, the son of Mary Baldwin and astronomer Sir William Herschel. He was the nephew of astronomer Caroline Herschel. He studied shortly at Eton College and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating as Senior Wrangler in 1813. It was during his time as an undergraduate that he became friends with the mathematicians Charles Babbage and George Peacock. He left Cambridge in 1816 and started working with his father. He took up astronomy in 1816, building a reflecting telescope with a mirror in diameter, and with a focal length. Between 1821 and 1823 he re-examined, with James South, the double stars catalogued by his father. He was one of the founders of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820. For his work with his father, he was presented with the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1826 (which he won again in 1836), and with the Lalande Medal of the French Academy of Sciences in 1825, while in 1821 the Royal Society bestowed upon him the Copley Medal for his mathematical contributions to their Transactions. Herschel was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1831, and he served as president of the Royal Astronomical Society three times: 1827–1829, 1839–1841 and 1847–1849.

Herschel&#x27;s &quot;A preliminary discourse on the study of natural philosophy&quot;, published early in 1831 as part of &quot;Dionysius Lardner&#x27;s Cabinet cyclopædia&quot;, set out methods of scientific investigation with an orderly relationship between observation and theorising. He described nature as being governed by laws which were difficult to discern or to state mathematically, and the highest aim of natural philosophy was understanding these laws through inductive reasoning, finding a single unifying explanation for a phenomenon. This became an authoritative statement with wide influence on science, particularly at the University of Cambridge where it inspired the student Charles Darwin with &quot;a burning zeal&quot; to contribute to this work.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1854.

Herschel published a catalogue of his astronomical observations in 1864, as the &quot;General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters&quot;, a compilation of his own work and that of his father&#x27;s, expanding on the senior Herschel&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of Nebulae&quot;. A further complementary volume was published posthumously, as the &quot;General Catalogue of 10,300 Multiple and Double Stars&quot;.

Herschel correctly considered astigmatism to be due to irregularity of the cornea and theorised that vision could be improved by the application of some animal jelly contained in a capsule of glass against the cornea. His views were published in an article entitled Light in 1828 and the &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot; in 1845.

Discoveries of Herschel include the galaxies NGC 7, NGC 10, NGC 25, and NGC 28.


== Visit to South Africa ==

He declined an offer from the Duke of Sussex that they travel to South Africa on a Navy ship.

Herschel had his own inherited money and he paid £500 for passage on the S.S. &quot;Mountstuart Elphinstone&quot;. He, his wife, their three children and his 20 inch telescope departed from Portsmouth on 13 November 1833.

The voyage to South Africa was made to catalogue the stars, nebulae, and other objects of the southern skies. This was to be a completion as well as extension of the survey of the northern heavens undertaken initially by his father William Herschel. He arrived in Cape Town on 15 January 1834 and set up a private telescope at Feldhausen (site of present day Grove Primary School) at Claremont, a suburb of Cape Town. Amongst his other observations during this time was that of the return of Comet Halley. Herschel collaborated with Thomas Maclear, the Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope and the members of the two families became close friends. During this time, he also witnessed the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae (December 1837).

In addition to his astronomical work, however, this voyage to a far corner of the British empire also gave Herschel an escape from the pressures under which he found himself in London, where he was one of the most sought-after of all British men of science. While in southern Africa, he engaged in a broad variety of scientific pursuits free from a sense of strong obligations to a larger scientific community. It was, he later recalled, probably the happiest time in his life. A village in the contemporary province of Eastern Cape is named after him.

Herschel combined his talents with those of his wife, Margaret, and between 1834 and 1838 they produced 131 botanical illustrations of fine quality, showing the Cape flora. Herschel used a camera lucida to obtain accurate outlines of the specimens and left the details to his wife. Even though their portfolio had been intended as a personal record, and despite the lack of floral dissections in the paintings, their accurate rendition makes them more valuable than many contemporary collections. Some 112 of the 132 known flower studies were collected and published as &quot;Flora Herscheliana&quot; in 1996. The book also included work by Charles Davidson Bell and Thomas Bowler.

As their home during their stay in the Cape, the Herschels had selected &#x27;Feldhausen&#x27; (&quot;Field Houses&quot;), an old estate on the south-eastern side of Table Mountain. Here John set up his reflector to begin his survey of the southern skies.

Herschel, at the same time, read widely. Intrigued by the ideas of gradual formation of landscapes set out in Charles Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;, he wrote to Lyell on 20 February 1836 praising the book as a work that would bring &quot;a complete revolution in [its] subject, by altering entirely the point of view in which it must thenceforward be contemplated&quot; and opening a way for bold speculation on &quot;that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others.&quot; Herschel himself thought catastrophic extinction and renewal &quot;an inadequate conception of the Creator&quot; and by analogy with other intermediate causes, &quot;the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process&quot;. He prefaced his words with the couplet:

Taking a gradualist view of development and referring to evolutionary descent from a proto-language, Herschel commented:

The document was circulated, and Charles Babbage incorporated extracts in his ninth and unofficial &quot;Bridgewater Treatise&quot;, which postulated laws set up by a divine programmer. When HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; called at Cape Town, Captain Robert FitzRoy and the young naturalist Charles Darwin visited Herschel on 3 June 1836. Later on, Darwin would be influenced by Herschel&#x27;s writings in developing his theory advanced in &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;. In the opening lines of that work, Darwin writes that his intent is &quot;to throw some light on the origin of species – that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers,&quot; referring to Herschel. However, Herschel ultimately rejected the theory of natural selection.

Herschel returned to England in 1838, was created a baronet, of Slough in the County of Buckingham, and published &quot;Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope&quot; in 1847. In this publication he proposed the names still used today for the seven then-known satellites of Saturn: Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Iapetus. In the same year, Herschel received his second Copley Medal from the Royal Society for this work. A few years later, in 1852, he proposed the names still used today for the four then-known satellites of Uranus: Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. A stone obelisk, erected in 1842 and now in the grounds of The Grove Primary School, marks the site where his 20-ft reflector once stood.

== Photography ==

Herschel made numerous important contributions to photography. He made improvements in photographic processes, particularly in inventing the cyanotype process, which became known as blueprints, and variations, such as the chrysotype. In 1839, he made a photograph on glass, which still exists, and experimented with some colour reproduction, noting that rays of different parts of the spectrum tended to impart their own colour to a photographic paper. Herschel made experiments using photosensitive emulsions of vegetable juices, called phytotypes, also known as anthotypes, and published his discoveries in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1842. He collaborated in the early 1840s with Henry Collen, portrait painter to Queen Victoria. Herschel originally discovered the platinum process on the basis of the light sensitivity of platinum salts, later developed by William Willis.

Herschel coined the term &quot;photography&quot; in 1839. Herschel was also the first to apply the terms &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;positive&quot; to photography.

Herschel discovered sodium thiosulfate to be a solvent of silver halides in 1819, and informed Talbot and Daguerre of his discovery that this &quot;hyposulphite of soda&quot; (&quot;hypo&quot;) could be used as a photographic fixer, to &quot;fix&quot; pictures and make them permanent, after experimentally applying it thus in early 1839.

Herschel&#x27;s ground-breaking research on the subject was read at the Royal Society in London in March 1839 and January 1840.

== Other aspects of Herschel&#x27;s career ==
Herschel wrote many papers and articles, including entries on meteorology, physical geography and the telescope for the eighth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. He also translated the &quot;Iliad&quot; of Homer.
In 1823, Herschel published his findings on the optical spectra of metal salts.

Herschel invented the actinometer in 1825 to measure the direct heating power of the Sun&#x27;s rays, and his work with the instrument is of great importance in the early history of photochemistry.

Herschel proposed a correction to the Gregorian calendar, making years that are multiples of 4000 common years rather than leap years, thus reducing the average length of the calendar year from 365.2425 days to 365.24225. Although this is closer to the mean tropical year of 365.24219 days, his proposal has never been adopted because the Gregorian calendar is based on the mean time between vernal equinoxes (currently days).

Herschel was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832, and in 1836, a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. 

In 1835, the &quot;New York Sun&quot; newspaper wrote a series of satiric articles that came to be known as the Great Moon Hoax, with statements falsely attributed to Herschel about his supposed discoveries of animals living on the Moon, including batlike winged humanoids.

Several locations are named for him: the village of Herschel in western Saskatchewan, Canada, site of the discovery of &quot;Dolichorhynchops herschelensis&quot;, a type of plesiosaur; Mount Herschel in Antarctica; the crater J. Herschel on the Moon; and the settlement of Herschel, Eastern Cape and the Herschel Girls&#x27; School in Cape Town, South Africa.

While it is commonly accepted that Herschel Island, in the Arctic Ocean, part of the Yukon Territory, was named after him, the entries in the expedition journal of Sir John Franklin state that the latter wished to honour the Herschel family, of which John Herschel&#x27;s father, Sir William Herschel, and his aunt, Caroline Herschel, are as notable as John.

== Family ==

== Death ==
Herschel died on 11 May 1871 at age 79 at Collingwood, his home near Hawkhurst in Kent. On his death, he was given a national funeral and buried in Westminster Abbey.

His obituary by Henry W Field of London was read to the American Philosophical Society on 1 December 1871.

<text>De facto (, ; ; ) describes practices that exist in reality, regardless of whether they are officially recognized by laws or other formal norms. It is commonly used to refer to what happens in practice, in contrast with &quot;de jure&quot; (&#x27;by law&#x27;).

==Jurisprudence and &quot;de facto&quot; law==

In jurisprudence, a de facto&quot; law (also known as a de facto&quot; regulation) is a law or regulation that is followed but &quot;is not specifically enumerated by a law.&quot; By definition, &quot;de facto&quot; &#x27;contrasts&#x27; &quot;de jure&quot; which means &quot;as defined by law&quot; or &quot;as a matter of law.&quot; For example, if a particular law exists in one jurisdiction, but is followed in another where it has no legal effect (such as in another country), then the law could be considered a &quot;de facto&quot; regulation (a &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; regulation&quot; is not an officially prescribed legal classification for a &quot;type of law&quot; in a particular jurisdiction, rather, it is a concept about law(s).

A &quot;de facto&quot; regulation &quot;may&quot; be followed by an organization as a result of the market size of the &quot;jurisdiction imposing the regulation&quot; as a proportion of the overall market; wherein the market share is so large that it results in the organization choosing to comply by implementing one standard of business with respect to the given &quot;de facto&quot; law instead of altering standards between different jurisdictions and markets (e.g. data protection, manufacturing, etc.). The decision to voluntarily comply &quot;may&quot; be the result of: a desire to simplify manufacturing processes &amp; cost-effectiveness (&quot;such as adopting a one size fits all approach&quot;), consumer demand &amp; expectation, or other factors known only to the complier.

In prison sentences, the term &quot;de facto&quot; life sentence (also known as a &quot;virtual&quot; life sentence) is used to describe a &quot;non-life sentence&quot; that is long enough to end after the convicted person would have likely died due to old age, or one long enough to cause the convicted person to &quot;live out the vast majority of their life in jail prior to their release.&quot;

==Technical standards==

A de facto standard is a standard (formal or informal) that has achieved a dominant position by tradition, enforcement, or market dominance. It has not necessarily received formal approval by way of a standardization process, and may not have an official standards document.

Technical standards are usually voluntary, such as ISO 9000 requirements, but may be obligatory, enforced by government norms, such as drinking water quality requirements. The term &quot;de facto standard&quot; is used for both: to contrast obligatory standards (also known as &quot;de jure standards&quot;); or to express a dominant standard, when there is more than one proposed standard.

In social sciences, a voluntary standard that is also a de facto standard, is a typical solution to a coordination problem.

== Government and culture ==
===National languages===
Several countries, including Australia, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States, have a de facto national language but no official de jure national language.

Some countries have a de facto national language in addition to an official language. In Lebanon and Morocco, Arabic is an official language (in addition to Tamazight in the case of Morocco), but an additional de facto language is also French. In New Zealand, the official languages are Māori and New Zealand Sign Language; however, English is a third de facto language.

Russian was the de facto official language of the central government and, to a large extent, republican governments of the former Soviet Union, but was not declared de jure state language until 1990. A short-lived law, effected April 24, 1990, installed Russian as the sole de jure official language of the Union prior to its dissolution in 1991.

In Hong Kong and Macau, the special administrative regions of China, the official languages are English and Portuguese respectively, together with Chinese. However, no particular variety of Chinese referred to in law is specified. Cantonese (Hong Kong Cantonese) in traditional Chinese characters is the de facto standard in both territories.

===Governance and sovereignty===

A de facto government is a government wherein all the attributes of sovereignty have, by usurpation, been transferred from those who had been legally invested with them to others, who, sustained by a power above the forms of law, claim to act and do really act in their stead.

In politics, a de facto leader of a country or region is one who has assumed authority, regardless of whether by lawful, constitutional, or legitimate means; very frequently, the term is reserved for those whose power is thought by some faction to be held by unlawful, unconstitutional, or otherwise illegitimate means, often because it had deposed a previous leader or undermined the rule of a current one. &quot;De facto&quot; leaders sometimes do not hold a constitutional office and may exercise power informally.

Not all dictators are de facto rulers. For example, Augusto Pinochet of Chile initially came to power as the chairperson of a military junta, which briefly made him de facto leader of Chile, but he later amended the nation&#x27;s constitution and made himself president until new elections were called, making him the formal and legal ruler of Chile. Similarly, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s formal rule of Iraq is often recorded as beginning in 1979, the year he assumed the Presidency of Iraq. However, his de facto rule of the nation began earlier: during his time as vice president; he exercised a great deal of power at the expense of the elderly Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, the de jure president.

In Argentina, the successive military coups that overthrew constitutional governments installed de facto governments in 1930–1932, 1943–1946, 1955–1958, 1966–1973 and 1976–1983, the last of which combined the powers of the presidential office with those of the National Congress. The subsequent legal analysis of the validity of such actions led to the formulation of a doctrine of the de facto governments, a case law (precedential) formulation which essentially said that the actions and decrees of past de facto governments, although not rooted in legal legitimacy when taken, remained binding until and unless such time as they were revoked or repealed de jure by a subsequent legitimate government.

That doctrine was nullified by the constitutional reform of 1994. Article 36 states:

Two examples of de facto leaders are Deng Xiaoping of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and general Manuel Noriega of Panama. Both of these men exercised nearly all control over their respective nations for many years despite not having either legal constitutional office or the legal authority to exercise power. These individuals are today commonly recorded as the &quot;leaders&quot; of their respective nations; recording their legal, correct title would not give an accurate assessment of their power. A modern example of a de facto ruler is Ahmed al-Sharaa who became the de facto leader of Syria after the fall of the Assad regime. 

Another example of a de facto ruler is someone who is not the actual ruler but exerts great or total influence over the true ruler, which is quite common in monarchies. Some examples of these de facto rulers are Empress Dowager Cixi of China (for son Tongzhi Emperor and nephew Guangxu Emperor), Prince Alexander Menshikov (for his former lover Empress Catherine I of Russia), Cardinal Richelieu of France (for Louis XIII), Queen Elisabeth of Parma (for her husband, King Philip V) and Queen Maria Carolina of Naples and Sicily (for her husband King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies).

==== Borders ====
The de facto boundaries of a country are defined by the area that its government is actually able to enforce its laws in, and to defend against encroachments by other countries that may also claim the same territory de jure. The Durand Line is an example of a de facto boundary. As well as cases of border disputes, de facto boundaries may also arise in relatively unpopulated areas in which the border was never formally established or in which the agreed border was never surveyed and its exact position is unclear. The same concepts may also apply to a boundary between provinces or other subdivisions of a federal state.

==== Segregation ====
In South Africa, although de jure apartheid formally began in 1948, de facto racist policies and practices discriminating against black South Africans, People of Colour, and Indians dated back decades before.

&quot;De facto&quot; racial discrimination and segregation in the United States (outside of the South) until the 1950s and 1960s was simply discrimination that was segregation by law (de jure). &quot;Jim Crow laws&quot;, which were enacted in the 1870s, brought legal racial segregation against black Americans residing in the American South. These laws were legally ended in 1964 by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

== &quot;De facto&quot; state of war ==
Most commonly used to describe large scale conflicts of the 20th century, the phrase de facto state of war refers to a situation where two nations are actively engaging, or are engaged, in aggressive military actions against the other without a formal declaration of war.

==Marriage and domestic partnerships==
=== Relationships===
A domestic partner outside marriage is referred to as a de facto husband or wife by some authorities.

====In Australia and New Zealand====
In Australian law, a de facto relationship is a legally recognized, committed relationship of a couple living together (opposite-sex or same-sex). &quot;De facto&quot; unions are defined in the federal Family Law Act 1975. &quot;De facto&quot; relationships provide couples who are living together on a genuine domestic basis with many of the same rights and benefits as married couples. Two people can become a de facto couple by entering into a registered relationship (i.e.: civil union or domestic partnership) or by being assessed as such by the Family Court or Federal Circuit Court. Couples who are living together are generally recognised as a de facto union and thus able to claim many of the rights and benefits of a married couple, even if they have not registered or officially documented their relationship, although this may vary by state. It has been noted that it is harder to prove de facto relationship status, particularly in the case of the death of one of the partners.

In April 2014, an Australian federal court judge ruled that a heterosexual couple who had a child and lived together for 13 years were not in a de facto relationship and thus the court had no jurisdiction to divide up their property under family law following a request for separation. In his ruling, the judge stated &quot;de facto relationship(s) may be described as &#x27;marriage like&#x27; but it is not a marriage and has significant differences socially, financially and emotionally.&quot;

The above sense of de facto is related to the relationship between common law traditions and formal (statutory, regulatory, civil) law, and common-law marriages. Common law norms for settling disputes in practical situations, often worked out over many generations to establishing precedent, are a core element informing decision making in legal systems around the world. Because its early forms originated in England in the Middle Ages, this is particularly true in Anglo-American legal traditions and in former colonies of the British Empire, while also playing a role in some countries that have mixed systems with significant admixtures of civil law.

=====Relationships not recognised outside Australia=====
Due to Australian federalism, de facto partnerships can only be legally recognised whilst the couple lives within a state in Australia. This is because the power to legislate on de facto matters relies on referrals by States to the Commonwealth in accordance with Section 51(xxxvii) of the Australian Constitution, where it states the new federal law can only be applied back within a state. There must be a nexus between the de facto relationship itself and the Australian state.

If an Australian de facto couple moves out of a state, they do not take the state with them and the new federal law is tied to the territorial limits of a state. The legal status and rights and obligations of the de facto or unmarried couple would then be recognised by the laws of the country where they are ordinarily resident.

This is unlike marriage and &quot;matrimonial causes&quot; which are recognised by sections 51(xxi) and (xxii) of the Constitution of Australia and internationally by marriage law and conventions, Hague Convention on Marriages (1978).

===Non-marital relationship contract===
A de facto relationship is comparable to non-marital relationship contracts (sometimes called &quot;palimony agreements&quot;) and certain limited forms of domestic partnership, which are found in many jurisdictions throughout the world.

A de facto Relationship is not comparable to common-law marriage, which is a fully legal marriage that has merely been contracted in an irregular way (including by habit and repute). Only nine U.S. states and the District of Columbia still permit common-law marriage; but common law marriages are otherwise valid and recognised by and in all jurisdictions whose rules of comity mandate the recognition of any marriage that was legally formed in the jurisdiction where it was contracted.

===Family law – custody===
&quot;De facto&quot; joint custody is comparable to the joint legal decision-making authority a married couple has over their child(ren) in many jurisdictions (Canada as an example). Upon separation, each parent maintains de facto joint custody, until such time a court order awards custody, either sole or joint.

==Business ==
=== Monopoly ===
A de facto monopoly is a system where many suppliers of a product are allowed but the market is so completely dominated by one that the other players are unable to compete or even survive. The related terms oligopoly and monopsony are similar in meaning and this is the type of situation that antitrust laws are intended to eliminate.

=== Finance ===
In finance, the World Bank has a pertinent definition:

A &quot;de facto government&quot; comes into, or remains in, power by means not provided for in the country&#x27;s constitution, such as a coup d&#x27;état, revolution, usurpation, abrogation or suspension of the constitution.

=== Intellectual property ===
In engineering, is a system in which the intellectual property and know-how is privately held. Usually only the owner of the technology manufactures the related equipment. Meanwhile, a consists of systems that have been publicly released to a certain degree so that anybody can manufacture equipment supporting the technology. For instance, in cell phone communications, CDMA1X is a de facto technology, while GSM is a standard technology.

===Sports===
Examples of a de facto General Manager in sports include Syd Thrift who acted as the GM of the Baltimore Orioles between 1999 and 2002. Bill Belichick, the former head coach of the New England Patriots in the NFL did not hold the official title of GM, but served as de facto general manager as he had control over drafting and other personnel decisions.

<text>The United States Naval Observatory (USNO) is a scientific and military facility that produces geopositioning, navigation and timekeeping data for the United States Navy and the United States Department of Defense. Established in 1830 as the Depot of Charts and Instruments, it is one of the oldest scientific agencies in the United States, and remains the country&#x27;s leading facility for astronomical and timing data.

The observatory is located in Northwest Washington, D.C. at the northwestern end of Embassy Row. It is among the few pre-20th century astronomical observatories located in an urban area. In 1893, in an effort to escape light pollution, it was relocated from Foggy Bottom near the city&#x27;s center, to its Northwest Washington, D.C. location.

The USNO has conducted significant scientific studies throughout its history, including measuring the speed of light, observing solar eclipses, and discovering the moons of Mars. Its achievements include providing data for the first radio time signals, constructing some of the earliest and most accurate telescopes of their kind, and helping develop universal time. The Naval Observatory performs radio VLBI-based positions of quasars for astrometry and geodesy with numerous global collaborators (IERS), in order to produce Earth orientation parameters and to realize the celestial reference system (ICRF).

Aside from its scientific mission, since the 1970s the Naval Observatory campus hosts the official residence of the vice president of the United States.

==History==

President John Quincy Adams, who in 1825 signed the bill for the creation of a national observatory just before leaving presidential office, had intended for it to be called the National Observatory.

The names &quot;National Observatory&quot; and &quot;Naval Observatory&quot; were both used for 10 years, until the Secretary of the Navy officially adopted the latter.

Adams had made protracted efforts to bring astronomy to a national level. He spent many nights at the observatory, watching and charting the stars, which had always been one of his interests.

Established by order of the United States Secretary of the Navy John Branch on 6 December 1830 as the Depot of Charts and Instruments, the Observatory rose from humble beginnings: Placed under the command of Lieutenant Louis M. Goldsborough, with an annual budget of $330; its primary function was the restoration, repair, and rating of navigational instruments. 

=== Old Naval Observatory ===

It was established as a national observatory in 1842 by federal law and a Congressional appropriation of $25,000. Lt. J.M. Gilliss was put in charge of &quot;obtaining the instruments needed and books.&quot; Lt. Gilliss visited the principal observatories of Europe with the mission to purchase telescopes and other scientific devices, and books.

The observatory&#x27;s primary mission was to care for the United States Navy&#x27;s marine chronometers, charts, and other navigational equipment. It calibrated ships&#x27; chronometers by timing the transit of stars across the meridian. It opened in 1844 in Foggy Bottom, north of the site of the Lincoln Memorial and west of the White House. 

In 1893, the observatory moved to its current location in Northwest Washington, D.C. located on a 2000 foot circle of land atop &quot;Observatory Hill&quot;, overlooking Massachusetts Avenue.

In 2017, the facilities were listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===The time ball===
The first superintendent was Navy Commander M.F. Maury. Maury had the world&#x27;s first vulcanized time ball, created to his specifications by Charles Goodyear for the U.S. Observatory. Placed into service in 1845, it was the first time ball in the United States and the 12th in the world. Maury kept accurate time by the stars and planets.

The time ball was dropped every day except Sunday, precisely at the astronomically defined moment of mean solar noon; this enabled all ships and civilians within sight to know the exact time. By the end of the American Civil War, the Observatory&#x27;s clocks were linked via telegraph to ring the alarm bells in all of the Washington, D.C. firehouses three times a day.

The USNO held a one-off time-ball re-enactment for the year-2000 celebration.

===Nautical Almanac Office===
In 1849, the Nautical Almanac Office (NAO) was established in Cambridge, Massachusetts as a separate organization. In 1866, it was moved to Washington, D.C., operating near Fort Myer. It relocated to the U.S. Naval Observatory grounds in 1893.

On 20 September 1894, the NAO became a &quot;branch&quot; of USNO; however, it remained autonomous for several years.

The site houses the largest astronomy library in the United States (and the largest astrophysical periodicals collection in the world). The library includes a large collection of rare physics and astronomy books from the past millennium.

=== Measuring the astronomical unit ===
An early scientific duty assigned to the Observatory was the U.S. contribution to the definition of the Astronomical Unit, or the , which defines a standard mean distance between the Sun and the Earth. This was conducted under the auspices of the congressionally-funded U.S. Transit of Venus Commission. The astronomical measurements taken of the transit of Venus by a number of countries since 1639 resulted in a progressively more accurate definition of the .

Relying strongly on photographic methods, the naval observers returned 350 photographic plates in 1874, and 1,380 measurable plates in 1882. The results of the surveys conducted simultaneously from several locations around the world (for each of the two transits) produced a final value of the solar parallax, after adjustments, of 8.809″, with a probable error of 0.0059″, yielding a U.S.-determined Earth-Sun distance of , with a probable error of . The calculated distance was a significant improvement over several previous estimates.

=== The 26 inch and 40 inch refractors ===
The telescope used for the discovery of the Moons of Mars was the 26 inch (66 cm) refractor telescope, then located at Foggy Bottom, Washington, DC. In 1893 it was moved to its Northwest DC location.
In 1934, the largest optical telescope installed at USNO saw &quot;first light&quot;. This 40 inch aperture instrument was also the second (and final) telescope made by famed optician, George Willis Ritchey. The Ritchey–Chrétien telescope design has since become the &quot;de facto&quot; optical design for nearly all major telescopes, including the famed Keck telescopes and the space-borne Hubble Space Telescope. 

Because of light pollution in the Washington metropolitan area, USNO relocated the 40 inch telescope to Flagstaff, Arizona. A new Navy command, now called the USNO Flagstaff Station (NOFS), was established there. Those operations began in 1955. Within a decade, the Navy&#x27;s largest telescope, the 61 inch &quot;Kaj Strand Astrometric Reflector&quot; was built; it saw light at Flagstaff in 1964.

USNO continues to maintain its dark-sky observatory, NOFS, near Flagstaff. This facility now oversees the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer. 

=== History of the time service ===
By the early 1870s the USNO daily noon-time signal was distributed electrically, nationwide, via the Western Union Telegraph Company. Time was also &quot;sold&quot; to the railroads and was used in conjunction with railroad chronometers to schedule American rail transport. Early in the 20th century, the service was broadcast by radio, with Arlington time signal available to those with wireless receivers.

In November 1913 the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an antenna, exchanged sustained wireless (radio) signals with the U.S. Naval Observatory to determine the exact difference of longitude between the two institutions, via an antenna in Arlington, Virginia.

The U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington continues to be a major authority in the areas of Precise Time and Time Interval, Earth orientation, astrometry, and celestial observation. In collaboration with many national and international scientific establishments, it determines the timing and astronomical data required for accurate navigation, astrometry, and fundamental astronomy, and calculation methods — and distributes this information (such as star catalogs) on-line and in the annual publications &quot;The Astronomical Almanac&quot; and &quot;The Nautical Almanac&quot;.

Former USNO director Gernot M. R. Winkler initiated the &quot;Master clock&quot; service that the USNO still operates, and which provides precise time to the GPS satellite constellation run by the United States Space Force. The alternate Master Clock time service continues to operate at Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado.

==Departments==
In 1990 two departments were established: Orbital Mechanics and Astronomical Applications, with the Nautical Almanac Office a division in Astronomical Applications. The Orbital Mechanics Department operated under P. Kenneth Seidelmann until 1994, when the department was abolished and its functions transferred to a group within the Astronomical Applications Department.

In 2010, USNO&#x27;s astronomical &#x27;department&#x27; known as the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) was officially made autonomous as an Echelon 5 command, separate from, but still reporting to the USNO in Washington. In the alpine woodlands above 7,000 feet altitude outside Flagstaff, Arizona, NOFS performs its national, Celestial Reference Frame (CRF) mission under dark skies in that region.

===Official residence of the vice president of the United States===
A house situated on the grounds of the observatory, at Number One Observatory Circle, has been the official residence of the vice president of the United States since 1974. It is protected by tight security control enforced by the Secret Service. The house is separated from the Naval Observatory.

Before serving as the vice president&#x27;s residence, it was that of the observatory&#x27;s superintendent, and later the chief of naval operations.

==Time service==
The U.S. Naval Observatory operates two “Master Clock” facilities, one in Washington, DC, and the other at Schriever SFB near Colorado Springs, CO.
* The primary facility, in Washington, D.C. maintains 57 HP/Agilent/Symmetricom 5071A-001 high performance cesium atomic clocks and 24 hydrogen masers. 
* The alternate facility, at Schriever Space Force Base, maintains 12 cesium clocks and 3 masers.

The observatory also operates four rubidium atomic fountain clocks, which have a stability reaching 7. The observatory plans to build several more of this type for use at its two facilities.

The clocks used for the USNO timescale are kept in 19 environmental chambers, whose temperatures are kept constant to within 0.1°C. The relative humidities are kept constant in all maser, and most cesiums enclosures, to within 1%. Time-scale management only uses the clocks in Washington, DC, and of those, preferentially uses the clocks that currently conform reliably to the time reports of the majority. It is the combined ‘vote’ of the ensemble that constitutes the otherwise-fictitious “Master Clock”. The time-scale computations on 7 June 2007 weighted 70 of the clocks into the standard.
The U.S. Naval Observatory provides public time service via 26 NTP servers on the public Internet, and via telephone voice announcements:
* +1 202 762-1401 (Washington, DC)
* +1 202 762-1069 (Washington, DC)
* +1 719 567-6742 (Colorado Springs, CO)
The voice of actor Fred Covington (1928–1993) has been announcing the USNO time since 1978.

The voice announcements always begin with the local time (daylight or standard), and include a background of 1 second ticks. Local time announcements are made on the minute, and 15, 30, and 45 seconds after the minute. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is announced 5 seconds after the local time. Upon connecting, only the second-marking ticks are heard for the few seconds before the next scheduled local time announcement

The USNO also operates a modem time service, and provides time to the Global Positioning System.

==Instrument shop==
The United States Naval Observatory Instrument shop has been designing and manufacturing precise instrumentation since the early 1900s.

<text>An exciton is a bound state of an electron and an electron hole which are attracted to each other by the electrostatic Coulomb force resulting from their opposite charges. It is an electrically neutral quasiparticle regarded as an elementary excitation primarily in condensed matter, such as insulators, semiconductors, some metals, and in some liquids. It transports energy without transporting net electric charge.

An exciton can form when an electron from the valence band of a crystal is promoted in energy to the conduction band e.g., when a material absorbs a photon. Promoting the electron to the conduction band leaves a positively charged hole in the valence band. Here &#x27;hole&#x27; represents the unoccupied quantum mechanical electron state with a positive charge, an analogue in crystal of a positron. Because of the attractive coulomb force between the electron and the hole, a bound state is formed, akin to that of the electron and proton in a hydrogen atom or the electron and positron in positronium. Excitons are composite bosons since they are formed from two fermions which are the electron and the hole.

Excitons are often treated in the two limiting cases:
*The small radius excitons, or Frenkel excitons, where the electron-hole relative distance is restricted to one or only a few nearest neighbour unit cells. Frenkel excitons typically occur in insulators and organic semiconductors with relatively narrow allowed energy bands and accordingly, rather heavy Effective mass.
*the large radius excitons are called Wannier-Mott excitons, for which the relative motion of electron and hole in the crystal covers many unit cells. Wannier-Mott excitons are considered as hydrogen-like quasiparticles. The wavefunction of the bound state then is said to be hydrogenic, resulting in a series of energy states in analogy to a hydrogen atom. Compared to a hydrogen atom, the exciton binding energy in a crystal is much smaller and the exciton&#x27;s size (radius) is much larger. This is mainly because of two effects: (a) Coulomb forces are screened in a crystal, which is expressed as a relative permittivity εr significantly larger than 1 and (b) the Effective mass of the electron and hole in a crystal are typically smaller compared to that of free electrons. Wannier-Mott excitons with binding energies ranging from a few to hundreds of meV, depending on the crystal, occur in many semiconductors including Cu2 O, GaAs, other III-V and II-VI semiconductors, transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2. 

Excitons give rise to spectrally narrow lines in optical absorption, reflection, transmission and luminescence spectra with the energies below the free-particle band gap of an insulator or a semiconductor. Exciton binding energy and radius can be extracted from optical absorption measurements in applied magnetic fields.

The exciton as a quasiparticle is characterized by the momentum (or wavevector K) describing free propagation of the electron-hole pair as a composite particle in the crystalline lattice in agreement with the Bloch theorem. The exciton energy depends on K and is typically parabolic for the wavevectors much smaller than the reciprocal lattice vector of the host lattice. The exciton energy also depends on the respective orientation of the electron and hole spins, whether they are parallel or anti-parallel. The spins are coupled by the exchange interaction, giving rise to exciton energy fine structure.

In metals and highly doped semiconductors a concept of the Gerald Mahan exciton is invoked where the hole in a valence band is correlated with the Fermi sea of conduction electrons. In that case no bound state in a strict sense is formed, but the Coulomb interaction leads to a significant enhancement of absorption in the vicinity of the fundamental absorption edge also known as the Mahan or Fermi-edge singularity.

== History ==
The concept of excitons was first proposed by Yakov Frenkel in 1931, when he described the excitation of an atomic lattice considering what is now called the tight-binding description of the band structure. In his model the electron and the hole bound by the coulomb interaction are located either on the same or on the nearest neighbouring sites of the lattice, but the exciton as a composite quasi-particle is able to travel through the lattice without any net transfer of charge, which led to many propositions for optoelectronic devices.

== Types ==

=== Frenkel exciton ===
In materials with a relatively small dielectric constant, the Coulomb interaction between an electron and a hole may be strong and the excitons thus tend to be small, of the same order as the size of the unit cell. Molecular excitons may even be entirely located on the same molecule, as in fullerenes. This &quot;Frenkel exciton&quot;, named after Yakov Frenkel, has a typical binding energy on the order of 0.1 to 1 eV. Frenkel excitons are typically found in alkali halide crystals and in organic molecular crystals composed of aromatic molecules, such as anthracene and tetracene. Another example of Frenkel exciton includes on-site &quot;d&quot;-&quot;d&quot; excitations in transition metal compounds with partially filled &quot;d&quot;-shells. While &quot;d&quot;-&quot;d&quot; transitions are in principle forbidden by symmetry, they become weakly-allowed in a crystal when the symmetry is broken by structural relaxations or other effects. Absorption of a photon resonant with a &quot;d&quot;-&quot;d&quot; transition leads to the creation of an electron-hole pair on a single atomic site, which can be treated as a Frenkel exciton.

=== Wannier–Mott exciton ===
In semiconductors, the dielectric constant is generally large. Consequently, electric field screening tends to reduce the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes. The result is a &quot;Wannier–Mott exciton&quot;, which has a radius larger than the lattice spacing. Small effective mass of electrons that is typical of semiconductors also favors large exciton radii. As a result, the effect of the lattice potential can be incorporated into the effective masses of the electron and hole. Likewise, because of the lower masses and the screened Coulomb interaction, the binding energy is usually much less than that of a hydrogen atom, typically on the order of . This type of exciton was named for Gregory Wannier and Nevill Francis Mott. Wannier–Mott excitons are typically found in semiconductor crystals with small energy gaps and high dielectric constants, but have also been identified in liquids, such as liquid xenon. They are also known as &quot;large excitons&quot;.

In single-wall carbon nanotubes, excitons have both Wannier–Mott and Frenkel character. This is due to the nature of the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes in one-dimension. The dielectric function of the nanotube itself is large enough to allow for the spatial extent of the wave function to extend over a few to several nanometers along the tube axis, while poor screening in the vacuum or dielectric environment outside of the nanotube allows for large (0.4 to ) binding energies.

Often more than one band can be chosen as source for the electron and the hole, leading to different types of excitons in the same material. Even high-lying bands can be effective as femtosecond two-photon experiments have shown. At cryogenic temperatures, many higher excitonic levels can be observed approaching the edge of the band, forming a series of spectral absorption lines that are in principle similar to hydrogen spectral series.

==== 3D semiconductors ====
In a bulk semiconductor, a Wannier exciton has an energy and radius associated with it, called exciton Rydberg energy and exciton Bohr radius respectively. For the energy, we have

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the Rydberg unit of energy (cf. Rydberg constant), formula_3 is the (static) relative permittivity, formula_4 is the reduced mass of the electron and hole, and formula_5 is the electron mass. Concerning the radius, we have

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the Bohr radius.

For example, in GaAs, we have relative permittivity of 12.8 and effective electron and hole masses as 0.067&quot;m0&quot; and 0.2&quot;m0&quot; respectively; and that gives us formula_8 meV and formula_9 nm.

==== 2D semiconductors ====
In two-dimensional (2D) materials, the system is quantum confined in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the material. The reduced dimensionality of the system has an effect on the binding energies and radii of Wannier excitons. In fact, excitonic effects are enhanced in such systems.

For a simple screened Coulomb potential, the binding energies take the form of the 2D hydrogen atom

:formula_10.

In most 2D semiconductors, the Rytova–Keldysh form is a more accurate approximation to the exciton interaction

:formula_11

where formula_12 is the so-called screening length, formula_13 is the vacuum permittivity, formula_14 is the elementary charge, formula_15 the average dielectric constant of the surrounding media, and formula_16 the exciton radius. For this potential, no general expression for the exciton energies may be found. One must instead turn to numerical procedures, and it is precisely this potential that gives rise to the nonhydrogenic Rydberg series of the energies in 2D semiconductors.

===== Example: excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) =====
Monolayers of a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) are a good and cutting-edge example where excitons play a major role. In particular, in these systems, they exhibit a bounding energy of the order of 0.5 eV with a Coulomb attraction between the hole and the electrons stronger than in other traditional quantum wells. As a result, optical excitonic peaks are present in these materials even at room temperatures.

==== 0D semiconductors ====

In nanoparticles which exhibit quantum confinement effects and hence behave as quantum dots (also called 0-dimensional semiconductors), excitonic radii are given by
:formula_17

where formula_3 is the relative permittivity, formula_19 is the reduced mass of the electron-hole system, formula_5 is the electron mass, and formula_21 is the Bohr radius.

=== Hubbard exciton ===

Hubbard excitons are linked to electrons not by a Coulomb&#x27;s interaction, but by a magnetic force. Their name derives by the English physicist John Hubbard.

Hubbard excitons were observed for the first time in 2023 through the Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. Those particles have been obtained by applying a light to a Mott antiferromagnetic insulator.

=== Charge-transfer exciton ===
An intermediate case between Frenkel and Wannier excitons is the &quot;charge-transfer (CT) exciton&quot;. In molecular physics, CT excitons form when the electron and the hole occupy adjacent molecules. They occur primarily in organic and molecular crystals; in this case, unlike Frenkel and Wannier excitons, CT excitons display a static electric dipole moment. CT excitons can also occur in transition metal oxides, where they involve an electron in the transition metal 3&quot;d&quot; orbitals and a hole in the oxygen 2&quot;p&quot; orbitals. Notable examples include the lowest-energy excitons in correlated cuprates or the two-dimensional exciton of TiO2. Irrespective of the origin, the concept of CT exciton is always related to a transfer of charge from one atomic site to another, thus spreading the wave-function over a few lattice sites.

=== Surface exciton ===
At surfaces it is possible for so called &quot;image states&quot; to occur, where the hole is inside the solid and the electron is in the vacuum. These electron-hole pairs can only move along the surface.

=== Dark exciton ===
Dark excitons are those where the electrons have a different momentum from the holes to which they are bound that is they are in an optically forbidden transition which prevents them from photon absorption and therefore to reach their state they need phonon scattering. They can even outnumber normal bright excitons formed by absorption alone.

=== Atomic and molecular excitons ===
Alternatively, an exciton may be described as an excited state of an atom, ion, or molecule, if the excitation is wandering from one cell of the lattice to another.

When a molecule absorbs a quantum of energy that corresponds to a transition from one molecular orbital to another molecular orbital, the resulting electronic excited state is also properly described as an exciton. An electron is said to be found in the lowest unoccupied orbital and an electron hole in the highest occupied molecular orbital, and since they are found within the same molecular orbital manifold, the electron-hole state is said to be bound. Molecular excitons typically have characteristic lifetimes on the order of nanoseconds, after which the ground electronic state is restored and the molecule undergoes photon or phonon emission. Molecular excitons have several interesting properties, one of which is energy transfer (see Förster resonance energy transfer) whereby if a molecular exciton has proper energetic matching to a second molecule&#x27;s spectral absorbance, then an exciton may transfer (&quot;hop&quot;) from one molecule to another. The process is strongly dependent on intermolecular distance between the species in solution, and so the process has found application in sensing and &quot;molecular rulers&quot;.

The hallmark of molecular excitons in organic molecular crystals are doublets and/or triplets of exciton absorption bands strongly polarized along crystallographic axes. In these crystals an elementary cell includes several molecules sitting in symmetrically identical positions, which results in the level degeneracy that is lifted by intermolecular interaction. As a result, absorption bands are polarized along the symmetry axes of the crystal. Such multiplets were discovered by Antonina Prikhot&#x27;ko and their genesis was proposed by Alexander Davydov. It is known as &#x27;Davydov splitting&#x27;.

=== Giant oscillator strength of bound excitons ===
Excitons are lowest excited states of the electronic subsystem of pure crystals. Impurities can bind excitons, and when the bound state is shallow, the oscillator strength for producing bound excitons is so high that impurity absorption can compete with intrinsic exciton absorption even at rather low impurity concentrations. This phenomenon is generic and applicable both to the large radius (Wannier–Mott) excitons and molecular (Frenkel) excitons. Hence, excitons bound to impurities and defects possess giant oscillator strength.

== Self-trapping of excitons==
In crystals, excitons interact with phonons, the lattice vibrations. If this coupling is weak as in typical semiconductors such as GaAs or Si, excitons are scattered by phonons. However, when the coupling is strong, excitons can be self-trapped. Self-trapping results in dressing excitons with a dense cloud of virtual phonons which strongly suppresses the ability of excitons to move across the crystal. In simpler terms, this means a local deformation of the crystal lattice around the exciton. Self-trapping can be achieved only if the energy of this deformation can compete with the width of the exciton band. Hence, it should be of atomic scale, of about an electron volt.

Self-trapping of excitons is similar to forming strong-coupling polarons but with three essential differences. First, self-trapped exciton states are always of a small radius, of the order of lattice constant, due to their electric neutrality. Second, there exists a self-trapping barrier separating free and self-trapped states, hence, free excitons are metastable. Third, this barrier enables coexistence of free and self-trapped states of excitons. This means that spectral lines of free excitons and wide bands of self-trapped excitons can be seen simultaneously in absorption and luminescence spectra. While the self-trapped states are of lattice-spacing scale, the barrier has typically much larger scale. Indeed, its spatial scale is about formula_22 where formula_23 is effective mass of the exciton, formula_24 is the exciton-phonon coupling constant, and formula_25 is the characteristic frequency of optical phonons. Excitons are self-trapped when formula_23 and formula_24 are large, and then the spatial size of the barrier is large compared with the lattice spacing. Transforming a free exciton state into a self-trapped one proceeds as a collective tunneling of coupled exciton-lattice system (an instanton). Because formula_28 is large, tunneling can be described by a continuum theory. The height of the barrier formula_29. Because both formula_23 and formula_24 appear in the denominator of formula_32, the barriers are basically low. Therefore, free excitons can be seen in crystals with strong exciton-phonon coupling only in pure samples and at low temperatures. Coexistence of free and self-trapped excitons was observed in rare-gas solids, alkali-halides, and in molecular crystal of pyrene.

==Interaction==
Excitons are the main mechanism for light emission in semiconductors at low temperature (when the characteristic thermal energy &quot;kT&quot; is less than the exciton binding energy), replacing the free electron-hole recombination at higher temperatures.

The existence of exciton states may be inferred from the absorption of light associated with their excitation. Typically, excitons are observed just below the band gap.

When excitons interact with photons a so-called polariton (or more specifically exciton-polariton) is formed. These excitons are sometimes referred to as &quot;dressed excitons&quot;.

Provided the interaction is attractive, an exciton can bind with other excitons to form a biexciton, analogous to a dihydrogen molecule. If a large density of excitons is created in a material, they can interact with one another to form an electron-hole liquid, a state observed in k-space indirect semiconductors.

Additionally, excitons are integer-spin particles obeying Bose statistics in the low-density limit. In some systems, where the interactions are repulsive, a Bose–Einstein condensed state, called excitonium, is predicted to be the ground state. Some evidence of excitonium has existed since the 1970s but has often been difficult to discern from a Peierls phase. Exciton condensates have allegedly been seen in a double quantum well systems. In 2017 Kogar et al. found &quot;compelling evidence&quot; for observed excitons condensing in the three-dimensional semimetal 1&quot;T&quot;-TiSe2.

==Spatially direct and indirect excitons==
Normally, excitons in a semiconductor have a very short lifetime due to the close proximity of the electron and hole. However, by placing the electron and hole in spatially separated quantum wells with an insulating barrier layer in between so called &#x27;spatially indirect&#x27; excitons can be created. In contrast to ordinary (spatially direct), these spatially indirect excitons can have large spatial separation between the electron and hole, and thus possess a much longer lifetime. This is often used to cool excitons to very low temperatures in order to study Bose–Einstein condensation (or rather its two-dimensional analog).

==Fractional excitons==
Fractional excitons are a class of quantum particles discovered in bilayer graphene systems under the fractional quantum Hall effect. These excitons form when electrons and holes bind in a two-dimensional material separated by an insulating layer of hexagonal boron nitride. When exposed to strong magnetic fields, these systems display fractionalized excitonic behavior with distinct quantum properties.

<text>In physical geography, a fjord (also spelled fiord in New Zealand English; ) is a long, narrow sea inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by a glacier. Fjords exist on the coasts of Antarctica, the Arctic, and surrounding landmasses of the northern and southern hemispheres. Norway&#x27;s coastline is estimated to be long with its nearly 1,200 fjords, but only long excluding the fjords.

==Formation==

A true fjord is formed when a glacier cuts a U-shaped valley by ice segregation and abrasion of the surrounding bedrock. According to the standard model, glaciers formed in pre-glacial valleys with a gently sloping valley floor. The work of the glacier then left an overdeepened U-shaped valley that ends abruptly at a valley or trough end. Such valleys are fjords when flooded by the ocean. Thresholds above sea level create freshwater lakes. Glacial melting is accompanied by the rebounding of Earth&#x27;s crust as the ice load and eroded sediment is removed (also called isostasy or glacial rebound). In some cases, this rebound is faster than sea level rise. Most fjords are deeper than the adjacent sea; Sognefjord, Norway, reaches as much as below sea level. Fjords generally have a sill or shoal (bedrock) at their mouth caused by the previous glacier&#x27;s reduced erosion rate and terminal moraine. In many cases this sill causes extreme currents and large saltwater rapids (see skookumchuck). Saltstraumen in Norway is often described as the world&#x27;s strongest tidal current. These characteristics distinguish fjords from rias (such as the Bay of Kotor), which are drowned valleys flooded by the rising sea. Drammensfjorden is cut almost in two by the Svelvik &quot;ridge&quot;, a sandy moraine that was below sea level when it was covered by ice, but after the post-glacial rebound reaches above the fjord.

In the 19th century, Jens Esmark introduced the theory that fjords are or have been created by glaciers and that large parts of Northern Europe had been covered by thick ice in prehistory. Thresholds at the mouths and overdeepening of fjords compared to the ocean are the strongest evidence of glacial origin, and these thresholds are mostly rocky. Thresholds are related to sounds and low land where the ice could spread out and therefore have less erosive force. John Walter Gregory argued that fjords are of tectonic origin and that glaciers had a negligible role in their formation. Gregory&#x27;s views were rejected by subsequent research and publications. In the case of Hardangerfjord the fractures of the Caledonian fold has guided the erosion by glaciers, while there is no clear relation between the direction of Sognefjord and the fold pattern. This relationship between fractures and direction of fjords is also observed in Lyngen. Preglacial, tertiary rivers presumably eroded the surface and created valleys that later guided the glacial flow and erosion of the bedrock. This may in particular have been the case in Western Norway where the tertiary uplift of the landmass amplified eroding forces of rivers.

Confluence of tributary fjords led to excavation of the deepest fjord basins. Near the very coast, the typical West Norwegian glacier spread out (presumably through sounds and low valleys) and lost their concentration and reduced the glaciers&#x27; power to erode leaving bedrock thresholds. Bolstadfjorden is deep with a threshold of only , while the deep Sognefjorden has a threshold around deep. Hardangerfjord is made up of several basins separated by thresholds: The deepest basin Samlafjorden between Jonaneset (Jondal) and Ålvik with a distinct threshold at Vikingneset in Kvam Municipality.
Hanging valleys are common along glaciated fjords and U-shaped valleys. A hanging valley is a tributary valley that is higher than the main valley and was created by tributary glacier flows into a glacier of larger volume. The shallower valley appears to be &#x27;hanging&#x27; above the main valley or a fjord. Often, waterfalls form at or near the outlet of the upper valley. Small waterfalls within these fjords are also used as freshwater resources. Hanging valleys also occur underwater in fjord systems. The branches of Sognefjord are for instance much shallower than the main fjord. The mouth of Fjærlandsfjord is about deep while the main fjord is nearby. The mouth of Ikjefjord is only deep while the main fjord is around at the same point.

==Features and variations==
===Hydrology===
During the winter season, there is usually little inflow of water that is fresh. Surface water and deeper water (down to or more) are mixed during winter because of the steady cooling of the surface and wind. In the deep fjords, there is still fresh water from the summer with less density than the saltier water along the coast. Offshore wind, common in the fjord areas during winter, sets up a current on the surface from the inner to the outer parts. This current on the surface in turn pulls dense salt water from the coast across the fjord threshold and into the deepest parts of the fjord. Bolstadfjorden has a threshold of only and strong inflow of freshwater from Vosso river creates a brackish surface that blocks circulation of the deep fjord. The deeper, salt layers of Bolstadfjorden are deprived of oxygen and the seabed is covered with organic material. The shallow threshold also creates a strong tidal current.

During the summer season, there is usually a large inflow of river water in the inner areas. This freshwater gets mixed with saltwater creating a layer of brackish water with a slightly higher surface than the ocean which in turn sets up a current from the river mouths towards the ocean. This current is gradually more salty towards the coast and right under the surface current there is a reverse current of saltier water from the coast. In the deeper parts of the fjord the cold water remaining from winter is still and separated from the atmosphere by the brackish top layer. This deep water is ventilated by mixing with the upper layer causing it to warm and freshen over the summer. In fjords with a shallow threshold or low levels of mixing this deep water is not replaced every year and low oxygen concentration makes the deep water unsuitable for fish and animals. In the most extreme cases, there is a constant barrier of freshwater on the surface and the fjord freezes over such that there is no oxygen below the surface. Drammensfjorden is one example. The mixing in fjords predominantly results from the propagation of an internal tide from the entrance sill or internal seiching.

The Gaupnefjorden branch of Sognefjorden is strongly affected by freshwater as a glacial river flows in. Velfjorden has little inflow of freshwater.

===Coral reefs===
In 2000, some coral reefs were discovered along the bottoms of the Norwegian fjords. These reefs were found in fjords from the north of Norway to the south. The marine life on the reefs is believed to be one of the most important reasons why the Norwegian coastline is such a generous fishing ground. Since this discovery is fairly new, little research has been done. The reefs are host to thousands of lifeforms such as plankton, coral, anemones, fish, several species of shark, and many more. Most are specially adapted to life under the greater pressure of the water column above it, and the total darkness of the deep sea.

New Zealand&#x27;s fjords are also host to deep-water corals, but a surface layer of dark fresh water allows these corals to grow in much shallower water than usual. An underwater observatory in Milford Sound allows tourists to view them without diving.

===Skerries===
In some places near the seaward margins of areas with fjords, the ice-scoured channels are so numerous and varied in direction that the rocky coast is divided into thousands of island blocks, some large and mountainous while others are merely rocky points or rock reefs, menacing navigation. These are called skerries. The term skerry is derived from the Old Norse &quot;, which means a rock in the sea.

Skerries most commonly formed at the outlet of fjords where submerged glacially formed valleys perpendicular to the coast join with other cross valleys in a complex array. The island fringe of Norway is such a group of skerries (called a &quot;); many of the cross fjords are so arranged that they parallel the coast and provide a protected channel behind an almost unbroken succession of mountainous islands and skerries. By this channel, one can travel through a protected passage almost the entire route from Stavanger to North Cape, Norway. The Blindleia is a skerry-protected waterway that starts near Kristiansand in southern Norway and continues past Lillesand. The Swedish coast along Bohuslän is likewise skerry guarded. The Inside Passage provides a similar route from Seattle, Washington, and Vancouver, British Columbia, to Skagway, Alaska. Yet another such skerry-protected passage extends from the Straits of Magellan north for .

===Phytoplankton===
Fjords provide unique environmental conditions for phytoplankton communities. In polar fjords, glacier and ice sheet outflow add cold, fresh meltwater along with transported sediment into the body of water. Nutrients provided by this outflow can significantly enhance phytoplankton growth. For example, in some fjords of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), nutrient enrichment from meltwater drives diatom blooms, a highly productive group of phytoplankton that enable such fjords to be valuable feeding grounds for other species. It is possible that as climate change reduces long-term meltwater output, nutrient dynamics within such fjords will shift to favor less productive species, destabilizing the food web ecology of fjord systems.

In addition to nutrient flux, sediment carried by flowing glaciers can become suspended in the water column, increasing turbidity and reducing light penetration into greater depths of the fjord. This effect can limit the available light for photosynthesis in deeper areas of the water mass, reducing phytoplankton abundance beneath the surface.

Overall, phytoplankton abundance and species composition within fjords is highly seasonal, varying as a result of seasonal light availability and water properties that depend on glacial melt and the formation of sea ice. The study of phytoplankton communities within fjords is an active area of research, supported by groups such as FjordPhyto, a citizen science initiative to study phytoplankton samples collected by local residents, tourists, and boaters of all backgrounds.

===Epishelf lakes===
An epishelf lake forms when meltwater is trapped behind a floating ice shelf and the freshwater floats on the denser saltwater below. Its surface may freeze forming an isolated ecosystem.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;fjord&quot; is borrowed from Norwegian, where it is pronounced , , or in various dialects and has a more general meaning, referring in many cases to any long, narrow body of water, inlet or channel (for example, see Oslofjord).

The Norwegian word is inherited from Old Norse , a noun which refers to a &#x27;lake-like&#x27; body of water used for passage and ferrying and is closely related to the noun &quot;&quot; &quot;travelling, ferrying, journey&quot;. Both words go back to Indo-European &quot;crossing&quot;, from the root &quot;cross&quot;. The words and &quot;ferry&quot; are of the same origin.

The Scandinavian &quot;fjord&quot;, Proto-Scandinavian *&#x27;, is the origin for similar Germanic words: Icelandic &#x27;, Faroese &#x27;, Swedish &#x27; (for Baltic waterbodies), Scots &#x27; (for marine waterbodies, mainly in Scotland and northern England). The Norse noun &#x27; was adopted in German as &#x27;, used for the narrow long bays of Schleswig-Holstein, and in English as &quot;firth&quot; &quot;fjord, river mouth&quot;. The English word &quot;ford&quot; (compare German &#x27;, Low German &#x27; or &#x27;, in Dutch names &#x27; such as Vilvoorde, Ancient Greek , &#x27;, and Latin &#x27;) is assumed to originate from Germanic &#x27; and Indo-European root *&#x27; meaning &quot;crossing point&quot;. Fjord/firth/Förde as well as ford/Furt/Vörde/voorde refer to a Germanic noun for &quot;a travel&quot;: North Germanic &#x27; or &#x27; and of the verb &quot;to travel&quot;, Dutch &#x27;, German &quot;&quot;; English &quot;to fare&quot;.

As a loanword from Norwegian, it is one of the few words in the English language to start with the sequence &quot;fj&quot;. The word was for a long time normally spelled &quot;fiord&quot;, a spelling preserved in place names such as Grise Fiord. The &quot;fiord&quot; spelling mostly remains only in New Zealand English, as in the place name Fiordland.

===Scandinavian usage===


The use of the word fjord in Norwegian, Danish and Swedish is more general than in English and in international scientific terminology. In Scandinavia, &quot;fjord&quot; is used for a narrow inlet of the sea in Norway, Denmark and western Sweden, but this is not its only application. In Norway and Iceland, the usage is closest to the Old Norse, with fjord used for both a firth and for a long, narrow inlet. In eastern Norway, the term is also applied to long narrow freshwater lakes (Randsfjorden and Tyrifjorden) and sometimes even to rivers (for instance in Flå Municipality in Hallingdal, the Hallingdal river is referred to as &#x27;). In southeast Sweden, the name fjard &#x27; is a subdivision of the term &#x27;fjord&#x27; used for bays, bights and narrow inlets on the Swedish Baltic Sea coast, and in most Swedish lakes. This latter term is also used for bodies of water off the coast of Finland where Finland Swedish is spoken. In Danish, the word may even apply to shallow lagoons. In modern Icelandic, &#x27; is still used with the broader meaning of firth or inlet. In Faroese &#x27; is used both about inlets and about broader sounds, whereas a narrower sound is called &#x27;. In the Finnish language, a word &#x27; is used although there is only one fjord in Finland.

In old Norse genitive was &quot;fjarðar&quot; whereas dative was &quot;firði&quot;. The dative form has become common place names like Førde (for instance Førde), Fyrde or Førre (for instance Førre).

The German use of the word &#x27; for long narrow bays on their Baltic Sea coastline, indicates a common Germanic origin of the word. The landscape consists mainly of moraine heaps. The &#x27; and some &quot;fjords&quot; on the east side of Jutland, Denmark are also of glacial origin. But while the glaciers digging &quot;real&quot; fjords moved from the mountains to the sea, in Denmark and Germany they were tongues of a huge glacier covering the basin of which is now the Baltic Sea. See Förden and East Jutland Fjorde.

Whereas fjord names mostly describe bays (though not always geological fjords), straits in the same regions typically are named &quot;Sund&quot;, in Scandinavian languages as well as in German. The word is related to &quot;to sunder&quot; in the meaning of &quot;to separate&quot;. So the use of &quot;Sound&quot; to name fjords in North America and New Zealand differs from the European meaning of that word.

The name of Wexford in Ireland is originally derived from &#x27; (&quot;inlet of the mud flats&quot;) in Old Norse, as used by the Viking settlers—though the inlet at that place in modern terms is an estuary, not a fjord. Similarly the name of Milford (now Milford Haven) in Wales is derived from &#x27; (&quot;sandbank fjord/inlet&quot;), though the inlet on which it is located is actually a ria.

Before or in the early phase of Old Norse &quot;&quot; was another common noun for fjords and other inlets of the ocean. This word has survived only as a suffix in names of some Scandinavian fjords and has in same cases also been transferred to adjacent settlements or surrounding areas for instance Hardanger, Stavanger, and Geiranger.

==Differences in definitions==
The differences in usage between the English and the Scandinavian languages have contributed to confusion in the use of the term fjord. Bodies of water that are clearly fjords in Scandinavian languages are not considered fjords in English; similarly bodies of water that would clearly not be fjords in the Scandinavian sense have been named or suggested to be fjords. Examples of this confused usage follow.

In the Danish language some inlets are called a fjord, but are, according to the English language definition, technically not a fjord, such as Roskilde Fjord. Limfjord in English terminology is a sound, since it separates the North Jutlandic Island (Vendsyssel-Thy) from the rest of Jutland. However, the Limfjord once was a fjord until the sea broke through from the west. Ringkøbing Fjord on the western coast of Jutland is a lagoon. The long narrow fjords of Denmark&#x27;s Baltic Sea coast like the German were dug by ice moving from the sea upon land, while fjords in the geological sense were dug by ice moving from the mountains down to the sea. However, some definitions of a fjord is: &quot;A long narrow inlet consisting of only one inlet created by glacial activity&quot;. Examples of Danish fjords are: Kolding Fjord, Vejle Fjord and Mariager Fjord.

The fjords in Finnmark in Norway, which are fjords in the Scandinavian sense of the term, are not universally considered to be fjords by the scientific community, because although glacially formed, most Finnmark fjords lack the steep-sided valleys of the more southerly Norwegian fjords. The glacial pack was deep enough to cover even the high grounds when they were formed. The Oslofjord, on the other hand, is a rift valley, and not glacially formed.

The indigenous Māori people of New Zealand see a fjord as a kind of sea () that runs by a bluff (, altogether &quot;bluff sea&quot;).

===&quot;Fjords&quot; not created by glaciers===
The term &quot;fjord&quot; is sometimes applied to steep-sided inlets which were not created by glaciers. Most such inlets are drowned river canyons or rias. Examples include:
* In Acapulco, Mexico, the calanques (narrow, rocky inlets) on the western side of the city, where the famous cliff-divers perform daily, are described in the city&#x27;s tourist literature as being fjords.
* The calanques of Parc national des Calanques, Provence, France, are also referred to as fjords.
* Camel Estuary at Padstow, Cornwall, England, is sometimes referred to as a fjord. despite being classified as a ria.
* The Fiordo di Furore in Italy is actually a ria.
* Golfo Dulce in Puntarenas, Costa Rica. Like the Saco de Mamangua below, it is sometimes described as a &quot;tropical fjord&quot;.
* The Khor ash Sham in the Musandam Peninsula in Oman, and other &quot;khors&quot; or inlets in the deeply indented coast of Musandam, are often described as &quot;fjords&quot;. They were formed by the subduction of the Arabian tectonic plate beneath the Eurasian plate.
* Bay of Kotor in Montenegro
* the Lim bay in Istria, Croatia, is sometimes called &quot;Lim fjord&quot; although it is a ria dug by the river Pazinčica. The Croats call it &quot;&quot;, which does not translate precisely to the English equivalent either.
* Milford Haven Waterway in Pembrokeshire, Wales. This inlet is a ria. The place-name is derived from Old Norse &quot;Melrfjordr&quot; meaning &quot;sandbank fjord&quot;.
* Port Davey in Tasmania, Australia is popularly believed to be a &quot;fjord&quot;, but is now thought to be part of a drowned river valley system.
* in Paraty, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Colloquially, it&#x27;s been labeled the world&#x27;s &quot;only tropical fjord&quot;.

==Freshwater fjords==

Some Norwegian freshwater lakes that have formed in long glacially carved valleys with sill thresholds, ice front deltas or terminal moraines blocking the outlet follow the Norwegian naming convention; they are frequently named fjords. Ice front deltas developed when the ice front was relatively stable for long time during the melting of the ice shield. The resulting landform is an isthmus between the lake and the saltwater fjord, in Norwegian called &quot;eid&quot; as in placename Eidfjord or Nordfjordeid. The post-glacial rebound changed these deltas into terraces up to the level of the original sea level. In Eidfjord, Eio has dug through the original delta and left a terrace while lake is only above sea level. Such deposits are valuable sources of high-quality building materials (sand and gravel) for houses and infrastructure. Eidfjord village sits on the &quot;eid&quot; or isthmus between Eidfjordvatnet lake and Eidfjorden branch of Hardangerfjord. Nordfjordeid is the isthmus with a village between Hornindalsvatnet lake and Nordfjord. Such lakes are also denoted &quot;fjord valley lakes&quot; by geologists.

One of Norway&#x27;s largest is Tyrifjorden at above sea level and an average depth at most of the lake is under sea level. Norway&#x27;s largest lake, Mjøsa, is also referred to as &quot;the fjord&quot; by locals. Another example is the freshwater fjord Movatnet (Mo lake) that until 1743 was separated from Romarheimsfjorden by an isthmus and connected by a short river. During a flood in November 1743, the river bed eroded and sea water could flow into the lake at high tide. Eventually, Movatnet became a saltwater fjord and renamed Mofjorden (). Like fjords, freshwater lakes are often deep. For instance Hornindalsvatnet is at least deep and water takes an average of 16 years to flow through the lake. Such lakes created by glacial action are also called fjord lakes or moraine-dammed lakes.

Some of these lakes were salt after the ice age but later cut off from the ocean during the post-glacial rebound. At the end of the ice age Eastern Norway was about lower (the marine limit). When the ice cap receded and allowed the ocean to fill valleys and lowlands, and lakes like Mjøsa and Tyrifjorden were part of the ocean while Drammen valley was a narrow fjord. At the time of the Vikings Drammensfjord was still higher than today and reached the town of Hokksund, while parts of what is now the city of Drammen was under water. After the ice age the ocean was about at Notodden. The ocean stretched like a fjord through Heddalsvatnet all the way to Hjartdal. Post-glacial rebound eventually separated Heddalsvatnet from the ocean and turned it into a freshwater lake. In neolithic times Heddalsvatnet was still a saltwater fjord connected to the ocean, and was cut off from the ocean around 1500 BC.

Some freshwater fjords such as Slidrefjord are above the marine limit.

Like freshwater fjords, the continuation of fjords on land are in the same way denoted as &quot;fjord-valleys&quot;. For instance Flåmsdal (Flåm valley) and Måbødalen.

Outside of Norway, the three western arms of New Zealand&#x27;s Lake Te Anau are named North Fiord, Middle Fiord and South Fiord. Another freshwater &quot;fjord&quot; in a larger lake is Western Brook Pond, in Newfoundland&#x27;s Gros Morne National Park; it is also often described as a fjord, but is actually a freshwater lake cut off from the sea, so is not a fjord in the English sense of the term. Locally they refer to it as a &quot;landlocked fjord&quot;. Such lakes are sometimes called &quot;fjord lakes&quot;. Okanagan Lake was the first North American lake to be so described, in 1962. The bedrock there has been eroded up to &quot;below&quot; sea level, which is below the surrounding regional topography. Fjord lakes are common on the inland lea of the Coast Mountains and Cascade Range; notable ones include Lake Chelan, Seton Lake, Chilko Lake, and Atlin Lake. Kootenay Lake, Slocan Lake and others in the basin of the Columbia River are also fjord-like in nature, and created by glaciation in the same way. Along the British Columbia Coast, a notable fjord-lake is Owikeno Lake, which is a freshwater extension of Rivers Inlet. Quesnel Lake, located in central British Columbia, is claimed to be the deepest fjord formed lake on Earth.

===Great Lakes===
A family of freshwater fjords are the embayments of the North American Great Lakes. Baie Fine is located on the northwestern coast of Georgian Bay of Lake Huron in Ontario, and Huron Bay is located on the southern shore of Lake Superior in Michigan. 

==Locations==
The principal mountainous regions where fjords have formed are in the higher middle latitudes and the high latitudes reaching to 80°N (Svalbard, Greenland), where, during the glacial period, many valley glaciers descended to the then-lower sea level. The fjords develop best in mountain ranges against which the prevailing westerly marine winds are orographically lifted over the mountainous regions, resulting in abundant snowfall to feed the glaciers. Hence coasts having the most pronounced fjords include the west coast of Norway, the west coast of North America from Puget Sound to Alaska, the southwest coast of New Zealand, and the west and to south-western coasts of South America, chiefly in Chile.

===Principal fjord regions===
* West coast of Europe
** Faroe Islands
** Westfjords of Iceland
** Eastern Region of Iceland
** West Highlands of Scotland
** Norway, the whole coast including Svalbard
** Kola Peninsula in Russia
* West coast of New Zealand
** Fiordland, in the southwest of the South Island
* Northwest coast of North America
** Coast of Alaska, United States: Lynn Canal, Glacier Bay, etc.
** British Columbia Coast, Canada: from the Alaskan Border along the Portland Canal to Indian Arm; Kingcome Inlet is a typical West Coast fjord.
** Hood Canal in Washington, United States and various of the arms of Puget Sound
* Northeast coast of North America
** Labrador: Saglek Fjord, Nachvak Fjord, Hebron Fjord
** The east coast of Ungava Bay.
** Baffin Island
** Ellesmere Island
** Greenland: Kangerlussuaq, Ilulissat Icefjord, Scoresby Sund, Disko Island
* Southwest coast of South America
** Fjords and channels of Chile
** Isla de los Estados, Argentina

===Other glaciated or formerly glaciated regions===
Other regions have fjords, but many of these are less pronounced due to more limited exposure to westerly winds and less pronounced relief. Areas include:
* Europe
** Ireland
*** Lough Swilly
*** Carlingford Lough
*** Killary Harbour
** Russia (see also List of fjords of Russia)
*** Chukchi Peninsula
*** Kola Peninsula
** Scotland (where they are called firths, the Scots language cognate of fjord; lochs or sea lochs). Notable examples are:
*** Loch Long
*** Loch Fyne, Scotland&#x27;s longest fjord at 65 km
*** Loch Etive
** Sweden
*** Gullmarsfjorden, in Bohuslän, Sweden
** Wales
*** Mawddach Estuary, a fjord in-filled by glacial deposits.
* North America
** Canada:
*** the west and south coasts of Newfoundland, particularly:
**** Facheux Bay
**** Bonne Bay in Gros Morne National Park
**** Aviron Bay
**** La Hune Bay
**** Bay de Vieux
**** White Bear Bay
**** Baie d&#x27;Espoir
**** La Poile Bay
**** Bay Le Moine
*** the Canadian Arctic Archipelago
*** Quebec, Saguenay Fjord
** United States:
*** Somes Sound, Acadia National Park, Maine
*** Hudson River
**** most clearly seen at The Palisades
*** Puget Sound
* South America
** Argentina:
*** Isla de los Estados
* Arctic
** Arctic islands
*** Novaya Zemlya
*** Severnaya Zemlya
* Antarctica
** South Georgia (UK)
** Kerguelen Islands (France)
** particularly the Antarctic Peninsula
* Sub-Antarctic islands

===Extreme fjords===
The longest fjords in the world are:
# Nansen Sound/Greely Fiord/Tanquary Fiord in Canada— 
# Chatham Strait/Lynn Canal in United States—
# Scoresby Sund in Greenland—
# Concepción Channel-Puerto Simpson in Chile—
# Sognefjord in Norway—
# Independence Fjord in Greenland—
# Matochkin Shar, Novaya Zemlya, Russia— (a strait with a fjord structure)
Deep fjords include:
# Skelton Inlet in Antarctica—
# Sognefjord in Norway— (the mountains then rise to up to and more, Hurrungane reaches )
# Messier Channel in Tortel, Chile—
# Baker Channel in Tortel, Chile—

=== Heritage fjords ===
Norway has several heritage fjords, including UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other notable fjords, these will require visiting ships to be low-emission by 2026 and zero-emission by 2032

* Geirangerfjord
* Nærøyfjord

<text>Crayfish are freshwater crustaceans belonging to the infraorder Astacidea, which also contains lobsters. Taxonomically, they are members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. They breathe through feather-like gills. Some species are found in brooks and streams, where fresh water is running, while others thrive in swamps, ditches, and paddy fields. Most crayfish cannot tolerate polluted water, although some species, such as &quot;Procambarus clarkii&quot;, are hardier. Crayfish feed on animals and plants, either living or decomposing, and detritus.

The term &quot;crayfish&quot; is applied to saltwater species in some countries.

== Terminology ==

The name &quot;crayfish&quot; comes from the Old French word &#x27; (Modern French &#x27;). The word has been modified to &quot;crayfish&quot; by association with &quot;fish&quot; (folk etymology). The largely American variant &quot;crawfish&quot; is similarly derived.

Some kinds of crayfish are known locally as lobsters, crawdads, mudbugs, and yabbies. In the Eastern United States, &quot;crayfish&quot; is more common in the north, while &quot;crawdad&quot; is heard more in central and southwestern regions, and &quot;crawfish&quot; farther south, although considerable overlaps exist.

The study of crayfish is called astacology.

The body of a decapod crustacean, such as a crab, lobster, or prawn (shrimp), is made up of twenty body segments grouped into two main body parts, the cephalothorax and the abdomen. Each segment may possess one pair of appendages, although in various groups, these may be reduced or missing. On average, crayfish grow to in length. Walking legs have a small claw at the end.

==Diet==
Crayfish are opportunistic omnivorous scavengers, with the ability to filter and process mud. In aquaculture ponds using isotope analysis they were shown to build body tissue selectively from the animal protein portion of pelleted food and not the other components of the pellet.
They have the potential to eat most foods, even nutrient poor material such as grass, leaves, and paper, but can be highly selective and need variety to balance their diet. The personalities of the individual crayfish can be a key determinant in the food preference behaviour in aquaria.

Crayfish all over the world can be seen in an ecological role of benthic dwellers, so this is where most of their food is obtained - at the sediment/water interface in ponds, lakes, swamps, or burrows. When the gut contents are analysed, most of the contents is mud: fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) and mixed particles of lignin and cellulose (roots, leaves, bark, wood). Some animal material can also be identified, but this only contributes a small portion of the diet by volume. 

They feed on submerged vegetable material at times, but their ability to catch large living animal material is restricted. They can feed on interstitial organisms if they can be grasped in the small feeding claws. They can be lured into traps with an array of baits from dog biscuits, fish heads, meat, etc., all of which reinforces the fact that they are generalist feeders. 

On a day-to-day basis, they consume what they can acquire in their immediate environment in limited space and time available - detritus. At a microbial level, the FPOM has a high surface area of organic particles and consists of a plethora of substrate and bacteria, fungi, micro-algae, meiofauna, partially decomposed organic material and mucus. This mucus or &quot;slime&quot; is a biofilm and can be felt on the surface of leaves and sticks. Also crayfish have been shown to be coprophagic - eating their own faeces, they also eat their own exuviae (moulted carapace) and each other. They have even been observed leaving the water to graze.

Detritus or mud is a mixture of dead plankton (plant and animal), organic wastes from the water column, and debris derived from the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Mostly detritus is in the end phase of decomposition and is recognised as black organic mud. The crayfish usually ingest the material in only a few minutes, as distinct from grazing for many hours. The material is mixed with digestive fluids and sorted by size. The finer particles follow a slower and more exacting route through to the hindgut, compared to the coarser material. The coarser material is eliminated first and often reappears in approximately 10 to 12 hours, whereas the finer material is usually eliminated from 16 to 26 hours after ingestion.

All waste products coming out through the hindgut are wrapped in a peritrophic membrane, so they look like a tube. Such an investment in the wrapping of the microbial free faeces in a protein rich membrane is most likely the reason they are coprophagic. Such feeding behaviour based on selection, ingestion, and extreme processing ensures periodic feeding, as distinct from continuous grazing. They tend to eat to satiation and then take many hours to process the material, leaving minimal chance of having more room to ingest other items. Crayfish usually have limited home range and so they rest, digest, and eliminate their waste, most commonly in the same location each day.

Feeding exposes the crayfish to risk of predation, and so feeding behaviour is often rapid and synchronised with feeding processes that reduce such risks — eat, hide, process and eliminate.

Knowledge of the diet of these creatures was considered too complex since the first book ever written in the field of zoology, &quot;The Crayfish&quot; by T.H. Huxley (1879), where they were described as &quot;detritivores&quot;. This is why most researchers have not attempted to understand the diet of freshwater crayfish. The most complex study which matched the structure and function of the whole digestive tract with ingested material was performed in the 1990s by Brett O&#x27;Brien on marron, the least aggressive of the larger freshwater crayfish with aquaculture potential, similar to redclaw and yabbies.

== Classification and geographical distribution ==

Crayfish are closely related to lobsters, and together they belong to the infraorder Astacidea. Their phylogeny can be shown in the simplified cladogram below:
Four extant (living) families of crayfish are described, three in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere (Gondwana-distributed) family Parastacidae, with 14 extant genera and two extinct genera, live(d) in South America, Madagascar, and Australasia. They are distinguished by the absence of the first pair of pleopods. Of the other three Northern Hemisphere families (grouped in the superfamily Astacoidea), the four genera of the family Astacidae live in western Eurasia and western North America, the 15 genera of the family Cambaridae live in eastern North America, and the single genus of Cambaroididae live in eastern Asia.

=== North America === 

The greatest diversity of crayfish species is found in southeastern North America, with over 330 species in 15 genera, all in the family Cambaridae. A further genus of astacid crayfish is found in the Pacific Northwest and the headwaters of some rivers east of the Continental Divide. Many crayfish are also found in lowland areas where the water is abundant in calcium, and oxygen rises from underground springs. Crayfish are also found in some non-coastal wetlands; eight species of crayfish live in Iowa, for example.

In 1983, Louisiana designated the crayfish, or crawfish as they are commonly called, as its official state crustacean. Louisiana produces of crawfish per year with the red swamp and white river crawfish being the main species harvested. Crawfish are a part of Cajun culture dating back hundreds of years. A variety of cottage industries have developed as a result of commercialized crawfish iconography. Their products include crawfish attached to wooden plaques, T-shirts with crawfish logos, and crawfish pendants, earrings, and necklaces made of gold or silver.

=== Australia ===

Australia has over 100 species in a dozen genera. It is home to the world&#x27;s three largest freshwater crayfish:
* the Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish &quot;Astacopsis gouldi&quot;, which can achieve a mass over and is found in rivers of northern Tasmania
* the Murray crayfish &quot;Euastacus armatus&quot;, which can reach , although reports of animals up to have been made. It is found in much of the southern Murray-Darling basin.
* the marron from Western Australia (now believed to be two species, &quot;Cherax tenuimanus&quot; and &quot;C. cainii&quot;) which may reach 

Many of the better-known Australian crayfish are of the genus &quot;Cherax&quot;, and include the common yabby (&quot;C. destructor&quot;), western yabby (&quot;C. preissii&quot;), and red-claw crayfish (&quot;C. quadricarinatus&quot;).

The marron species &quot;C. tenuimanus&quot; is critically endangered, while other large Australasian crayfish are threatened or endangered.

=== New Zealand ===

In New Zealand, two species of &quot;Paranephrops&quot; are endemic, and are known by the Māori name &quot;&quot;.

=== Other animals === 

In Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, the term &quot;crayfish&quot; or &quot;cray&quot; generally refers to a saltwater spiny lobster, of the genus &quot;Jasus&quot; that is indigenous to much of southern Oceania, while the freshwater species are usually called &quot;yabbies&quot; or &quot;&quot;, from the indigenous Australian and Māori names for the animal, respectively, or by other names specific to each species. Exceptions include western rock lobster (of the Palinuridae family) found on the west coast of Australia (it is a spiny lobster, but not of &quot;Jasus)&quot;; the Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish (from the Parastacidae family and therefore a true crayfish) found only in Tasmania; and the Murray crayfish found along Australia&#x27;s Murray River.

In Singapore, the term crayfish typically refers to &quot;Thenus orientalis&quot;, a seawater crustacean from the slipper lobster family. True crayfish are not native to Singapore, but are commonly found as pets, or as an invasive species (&quot;Cherax quadricarinatus&quot;) in the many water catchment areas, and are alternatively known as &quot;freshwater lobsters&quot;.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the terms crayfish or crawfish commonly refer to the European spiny lobster, a saltwater species found in much of the East Atlantic and Mediterranean. The only true crayfish species native to the British Isles is the endangered white clawed crayfish.

== Fossil record ==

Fossil burrows very similar in construction to those of modern crayfish and likely produced by early crayfish are known from the Early Permian (~300-270 million years ago) of equatorial Pangea, in what is now North America (Washington Formation), and Europe (Sardinia). The oldest body fossils assigned to crayfish are known from the Late Triassic (~230-200 million years ago) Chinle Formation of North America, assigned to the species &quot;Enoploclytia&quot; &quot;porteri&quot; and &quot;Camborygma eumekenomos,&quot; which are not assigned to any modern families. An indeterminate member of the modern family Cambaridae is known from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of North America. The earliest records of other modern families date to the Early Cretaceous, including the parastacid &quot;Palaeoechinastacus&quot; from Australia which is 115 million years old, the cambaroidid &quot;Palaeocambarus&quot; from the Yixian Formation of China which is likely around 120 million years old (Barremian-Aptian), and the astacid &quot;&quot;Austropotamobius&quot; llopisi&quot; from the Las Hoyas site in Spain (Barremian).

== Threats to crayfish ==

Crayfish are susceptible to infections such as crayfish plague and to environmental stressors including acidification. In Europe, they are particularly threatened by crayfish plague, which is caused by the North American water mold &quot;Aphanomyces astaci.&quot; This water mold was transmitted to Europe when North American species of crayfish were introduced. Species of the genus &quot;Astacus&quot; are particularly susceptible to infection, allowing the plague-coevolved signal crayfish (native to western North America) to invade parts of Europe.

Acid rain can cause problems for crayfish across the world. In whole-ecosystem experiments simulating acid rain at the Experimental Lakes Area in Ontario, Canada, crayfish populations crashed – probably because their exoskeletons are weaker in acidified environments.

== Invasive pest ==

In several countries, particularly in Europe, native species of crayfish are under threat by imported species, particularly the signal crayfish (&quot;Pacifastacus leniusculus&quot;). Crayfish are also considered an invasive predatory species, endangering native European species such as the Italian agile frog and the painted frog in Malta.

== Uses ==

=== Culinary use ===
Crayfish are eaten worldwide. Like other edible crustaceans, only a small portion of the body of a crayfish is eaten. In most prepared dishes, such as soups, bisques and étouffées, only the tail portion is served. At crawfish boils or other meals where the entire body of the crayfish is presented, other portions, such as the claw meat, may be eaten.

Research shows that crayfish do not die immediately when boiled alive, and respond to pain in a similar way to mammals. Then the stress hormone cortisol is released and this leads to the formation of lactic acid in the muscles, which makes the meat taste sour. Crayfish can be cooked more humanely by first freezing them unconscious for a few hours, then destroying the central nervous system along their abdomen by cutting the crayfish lengthwise with a long knife down the center of the crayfish before cooking it.

Global crayfish production is centered in Asia, primarily China. In 2018, Asian production accounted for 95% of the world&#x27;s crawfish supply. 

Crayfish is part of Swedish cuisine and is usually eaten in August at special crayfish parties (). Documentation of the consumption of crayfish dates to at least the 16th century. On the Swedish west coast, Nephrops norvegicus (, ) is more commonly eaten while various freshwater crayfish are consumed in the rest of the country. Prior to the 1960s, crayfish was largely inaccessible to the urban population in Sweden and consumption was largely limited to the upper classes or farmers holding fishing rights in fresh water lakes. With the introduction of import of frozen crayfish the crayfish party is now widely practiced across all spheres in Sweden and among the Swedish-speaking population of Finland.

In the United States, crayfish production is strongly centered in Louisiana, with 93% of crayfish farms located in the state as of 2018. In 1987, Louisiana produced 90% of the crayfish harvested in the world, 70% of which were consumed locally. In 2007, the Louisiana crayfish harvest was about 54,800 tons, almost all of it from aquaculture. About 70–80% of crayfish produced in Louisiana are &quot;Procambarus clarkii&quot; (red swamp crawfish), with the remaining 20–30% being &quot;Procambarus zonangulus&quot; (white river crawfish). Optimum dietary nutritional requirement of freshwater crayfish, or crayfish nutrient specifications are now available for aquaculture feed producers 

Like all crustaceans, crayfish are not kosher because they are aquatic animals that do not have both fins and scales. They are therefore not eaten by observant Jews, and some Christian denominations.

=== Bait ===

Crayfish are preyed upon by a variety of ray-finned fishes, and are commonly used as bait, either live or with only the tail meat. They are a popular bait for catching catfish, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, striped bass, perch, pike and muskie. When using live crayfish as bait, anglers prefer to hook them between the eyes, piercing through their hard, pointed beak which causes them no harm; therefore, they remain more active.

When using crayfish as bait, it is important to fish in the same environment where they were caught. An Illinois State University report that focused on studies conducted on the Fox River and Des Plaines River watershed stated that rusty crayfish, initially caught as bait in a different environment, were dumped into the water and &quot;outcompeted the native clearwater crayfish&quot;. Other studies confirmed that transporting crayfish to different environments has led to various ecological problems, including the elimination of native species. Transporting crayfish as live bait has also contributed to the spread of zebra mussels in various waterways throughout Europe and North America, as they are known to attach themselves to exoskeleton of crayfishes.

=== Pets ===

Crayfish are kept as pets in freshwater aquariums. They prefer foods like shrimp pellets or various vegetables, but will also eat tropical fish food, regular fish food, algae wafers, and small fish that can be captured with their claws. A report by the National Park Service as well as video and anecdotal reports by aquarium owners indicate that crayfish will eat their moulted exoskeleton &quot;to recover the calcium and phosphates contained in it.&quot; As omnivores, crayfish will eat almost anything; therefore, they may explore the edibility of aquarium plants in a fish tank. However, most species of dwarf crayfish, such as &quot;Cambarellus patzcuarensis&quot;, will not destructively dig or eat live aquarium plants.

In some nations, such as the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, and New Zealand, imported alien crayfish are a danger to local rivers. The three most widespread American species invasive in Europe are &quot;Faxonius limosus&quot;, &quot;Pacifastacus leniusculus&quot; and &quot;Procambarus clarkii&quot;. Crayfish may spread into different bodies of water because specimens captured for pets in one river are often released into a different catchment. There is a potential for ecological damage when crayfish are introduced into non-native bodies of water: e.g., crayfish plague in Europe, or the introduction of the common yabby (&quot;Cherax destructor&quot;) into drainages east of the Great Dividing Range in Australia.

=== Education ===
Some public schools in the United States keep live crayfish in the classroom and have the students take care of them in order to give the students a greater understanding of the creatures.

=== Sentinel species ===

The Protivin brewery in the Czech Republic uses crayfish outfitted with sensors to detect any changes in their bodies or pulse activity in order to monitor the purity of the water used in their product. The creatures are kept in a fish tank that is fed with the same local natural source water used in their brewing. If three or more of the crayfish have changes to their pulses, employees know there is a change in the water and examine the parameters.

Scientists also monitor crayfish in the wild in natural bodies of water to study the levels of pollutants there.

<text>gnuplot is a command-line and GUI program that can generate two- and three-dimensional plots of functions, data, and data fits. The program runs on all major computers and operating systems (Linux, Unix, Microsoft Windows, macOS, FreeDOS, and many others).
Originally released in 1986, its listed authors are Thomas Williams, Colin Kelley, Russell Lang, Dave Kotz, John Campbell, Gershon Elber, Alexander Woo &quot;and many others.&quot; Despite its name, this software is not part of the GNU Project.

== Features ==
gnuplot can produce output directly on screen, or in many formats of graphics files, including Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), JPEG and many others. It is also capable of producing LaTeX code that can be included directly in LaTeX documents, making use of LaTeX&#x27;s fonts and powerful formula notation abilities. The program can be used both interactively and in batch mode using scripts.

gnuplot can read data in multiple formats, including ability to read data on the fly generated by other programs (piping), create multiple plots on one image, do 2D, 3D, contour plots, parametric equations, supports various linear and non-linear coordinate systems, projections, geographic and time data reading and presentation, box plots of various forms, histograms, labels, and other custom elements on the plot, including shapes, text and images, that can be set manually, computed by script or automatically from input data.

gnuplot also provides scripting capabilities, looping, functions, text processing, variables, macros, arbitrary pre-processing of input data (usually across columns), as well as the ability to perform non-linear multi-dimensional multi-set weighted data fitting (see Curve fitting and Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm).

The gnuplot core code is programmed in C. Modular subsystems for output via Qt, wxWidgets, and LaTeX/TikZ/ConTeXt are written in C++ and Lua.
The code below creates the graph to the right.

set title &quot;Some Math Functions&quot;
set xrange [-10:10]
set yrange [-2:2]
set zeroaxis
plot (x/4)**2, sin(x), 1/x

The name of this program was originally chosen to avoid conflicts with a program called &quot;newplot&quot;, and was originally a compromise between &quot;llamaplot&quot; and &quot;nplot&quot;.

Support of Epidemic daily and weekly formats in Version 5.4.2 is a result of pandemic coronavirus data needs.

== Distribution terms ==
Despite gnuplot&#x27;s name, it is not named after, part of or related to the GNU Project, nor does it use the GNU General Public License. It was named as part of a compromise by the original authors, punning on &quot;gnu&quot; (the animal) and &quot;newplot&quot; (a planned name that was discarded due to already being used).

Official source code to gnuplot is freely redistributable, but modified versions thereof are not. The gnuplot license allows instead distribution of patches against official releases, optionally accompanied by officially released source code. Binaries may be distributed along with the unmodified source code and any patches applied thereto. Contact information must be supplied with derived works for technical support for the modified software.
Permission to modify the software is granted, but not the right to distribute the complete modified source code. Modifications are to be distributed as patches to the released version.
Despite this restriction, gnuplot is accepted and used by many GNU packages and is widely included in Linux distributions including the stricter ones such as Debian and Fedora. The OSI Open Source Definition and the Debian Free Software Guidelines specifically allow for restrictions on distribution of modified source code, given explicit permission to distribute both patches and source code.

Newer gnuplot modules (e.g. Qt, wxWidgets, and cairo drivers) have been contributed under dual-licensing terms, e.g. gnuplot + BSD or gnuplot + GPL.

== GUIs and programs that use gnuplot ==
Several third-party programs have graphical user interfaces that can be used to generate graphs using gnuplot as the plotting engine. These include:

* gretl, a statistics package for econometrics
* JGNUPlot, a java-based GUI
* Kayali a computer algebra system
* xldlas, an old X11 statistics package
* gnuplotxyz, an old Windows program
* wxPinter, a graphical plot manager for gnuplot
* Maxima is a text-based computer algebra system which itself has several third-party GUIs
* REDUCE is a text-based computer algebra system; versions using CSL have a GUI and there are several third-party GUIs

Other programs that use gnuplot include:
* GNU Octave, a mathematical programming language 
* statist, a terminal-based program
* gplot.pl provides a simpler command-line interface.
* feedgnuplot provides a plotting of stored and realtime data from a pipe
* ElchemeaAnalytical, an impedance spectroscopy plotting and fitting program developed by DTU Energy
* Gnuplot add-in for Microsoft Excel
* Calc, the GNU Emacs calculator

== Programming and application interfaces ==
gnuplot can be used from various programming languages to graph data, including C++ (via G3P), Perl (via PDL and other CPAN packages), Python (via gnuplotlib, Gnuplot-py and SageMath), R via (Rgnuplot), Julia (via Gaston.jl), Java (via JavaGnuplotHybrid and jgnuplot), Ruby (via Ruby Gnuplot), Ch (via Ch Gnuplot), Haskell (via Haskell gnuplot), Fortran 95, Smalltalk (Squeak and GNU Smalltalk) and Rust (via RustGnuplot).

gnuplot also supports piping, which is typical of scripts. For script-driven graphics, gnuplot is one of the most popular programs.

== Gnuplot output formats ==
Gnuplot allows the user to display or store plots in several ways:
* On the console, such as dumb, sixel.
* In a desktop window, such as Qt, wxt, X11, aquaterm, win.
* Embedded in a web page, such as SVG, HTML5, PNG, JPEG, animated GIF.
* File formats designed for document processing, such as PostScript, PDF, cgm, emf, LaTeX variants.

<text>The Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies is a multilateral export control regime established on 12 July 1996, in Wassenaar, near The Hague, Netherlands. According to the Wassenaar Arrangement document, it was &quot;established to contribute to regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies, thus preventing destabilizing accumulations. Participating states seek, through their national policies, to ensure that transfers of these items do not contribute to the development or enhancement of military capabilities which undermine these goals, and are not diverted to support such capabilities&quot;.

It is the successor to the Cold War–era Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom). The Wassenaar Arrangement is considerably less strict than CoCom, focusing primarily on the transparency of national export control regimes and not granting veto power to individual members over organizational decisions. A Secretariat for administering the agreement is located in Vienna, Austria. Like CoCom, however, it is not a treaty, and therefore is not legally binding.

Every six months member countries exchange information on deliveries of conventional arms to non-Wassenaar members that fall under eight broad weapons categories: battle tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, large-calibre artillery, military aircraft, military helicopters, warships, missiles or missile systems, and small arms and light weapons.

There are 42 participating states including many former Comecon (Warsaw Pact) countries, including Russia.

== Control lists ==

The outline of the arrangement is set out in a document entitled &quot;Guidelines &amp; Procedures, including the Initial Elements&quot;. The list of restricted technologies is broken into two parts, the &quot;List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies&quot; (also known as the &quot;Basic List&quot;) and the &quot;Munitions List&quot;. The Basic List is composed of ten categories based on increasing levels of sophistication:

* Category 1 – Special Materials and Related Equipment
* Category 2 – Materials Processing
* Category 3 – Electronics
* Category 4 – Computers
* Category 5 – Part 1 – Telecommunications
* Category 5 – Part 2 – Information Security
* Category 6 – Sensors and Lasers
* Category 7 – Navigation and Avionics
* Category 8 – Marine
* Category 9 – Aerospace and Propulsion

Basic List has two nested subsections—Sensitive and Very Sensitive. Items of the Very Sensitive List include materials for stealth technology—i.e., equipment that could be used for submarine detection, advanced radar, and jet engine technologies.

Within each of the categories, there are 5 types of controlled item. These are approximately as follows:
* A – Physical goods and components
* B – Plant, test equipment etc. for the production of the goods
* C – Materials typically from which the goods can be created
* D – Software used typically for the development, production or use of the goods
* E – Technology used typically for the development, production or use of the goods
The types of item B, C, D and E typically refer to the type A items, but there are many exceptions, e.g. some materials may be controlled, even though there is no specific good referred to.

The Wassenaar Arrangement List&#x27;s categories are typically processed, and merged with other sources, e.g. Category 5.A.2 maps on to US ECCN 5A002, and EU control classification 5A002.

The Munitions List has 22 categories, which are not labeled.

In order for an item to be placed on the lists, member states must take into account the following 
criteria:
* Foreign availability outside participating states
* Ability to effectively control the export of the goods
* Ability to make a clear and objective specification of the item
* Controlled by another regime, such as the Australia Group, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, or the Missile Technology Control Regime

== Admission requirements ==

Admission requires states to:

* Be a producer or exporter of arms or sensitive industrial equipment
* Maintain non-proliferation policies and appropriate national policies, including adherence to:
** Non-proliferation policies, such as (where applicable) the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Australia Group
** Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Biological Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention and, where applicable, START I (including the Lisbon Protocol)
* Maintain fully effective export controls

The Arrangement is open on a global and non-discriminatory basis to prospective adherents that comply with the agreed criteria. Admission of new members requires the consensus of all members.

India joined as the 42nd participating state on 7 December 2017. &quot;Wassenaar Arrangement participating states reviewed the progress of a number of current membership applications and agreed at the plenary meeting to admit India which will become the Arrangement&#x27;s 42nd participating state as soon as the necessary procedural arrangements for joining the WA are completed&quot;, the grouping said in a statement. India&#x27;s application was supported by Russia, the United States, France and Germany.

== 2013 amendments ==

In December 2013, the list of export restricted technologies was amended to include Internet-based surveillance systems. New technologies placed under the export control regime include &quot;intrusion software&quot;—software designed to defeat a computer or network&#x27;s protective measures so as to extract data or information—as well as IP network surveillance systems.

The purpose of the amendments was to prevent Western technology companies from selling surveillance technology to governments known to abuse human rights. However, some technology companies have expressed concerns that the scope of the controls may be too broad, limiting security researchers&#x27; ability to identify and correct security vulnerabilities. Google and Facebook criticised the agreement for the restrictions it will place on activities like penetration testing, sharing information about threats, and bug bounty programs. They argue that the restrictions will weaken the security of participating nations and do little to curb threats from non-participant nations.

== &quot;Wassenaar minus one&quot; ==

During 2022 and 2023, a variety of proposals for modification to the listed items were proposed within Wassenaar, but were not accepted. Several states made unilateral legislation, rather than obtaining harmonisation through the Arrangement, including:
* Spain (for quantum computers containing more than 34 qubits and error rates below a certain controlled NOT gate error threshold, along with restrictions for quantum computers with more qubits and higher error rates, and cryo-computing technologies
* Netherlands for equipment for manufacturing advanced-process-node semiconductors
* US for AI chips and technology, and lasers and cameras associated with some types of additive manufacture
The corresponding proposals within WA were not accepted, due to objection from the Russian delegation. Only minor and editorial changes were universally accepted. At the time, Russia faced international sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.

Consequently in mid 2024 and later, many Wassenaar nations have implemented export controls corresponding to the unliateral legislation above. These include UK and Canada. These are classified as &#x27;country specific&#x27;, although there appears to he harmonisation of these 2024 controls across many advanced economies. The introduction of these controls caused surprise in some circles. Other nations largely harmonised their export controls over the course of 2024 and early 2025.

<doc id="43604" wikidata="Q189838" url="?curid=43604" title="Bud">
<text>In botany, a bud is an undeveloped or embryonic shoot and normally occurs in the axil of a leaf or at the tip of a stem. Once formed, a bud may remain for some time in a dormant condition, or it may form a shoot immediately. Buds may be specialized to develop flowers or short shoots or may have the potential for general shoot development. The term bud is also used in zoology, where it refers to an outgrowth from the body which can develop into a new individual.

==Overview==

The buds of many woody plants, especially in temperate or cold climates, are protected by a covering of modified leaves called &quot;scales&quot; which tightly enclose the more delicate parts of the bud. Many bud scales are covered by a gummy substance which serves as added protection. When the bud develops, the scales may enlarge somewhat but usually just drop off, leaving a series of horizontally-elongated scars on the surface of the growing stem. By means of these scars one can determine the age of any young branch, since each year&#x27;s growth ends in the formation of a bud, the formation of which produces an additional group of bud scale scars. Continued growth of the branch causes these scars to be obliterated after a few years so that the total age of older branches cannot be determined by this means.

In many plants, scales do not form over the bud, and the bud is then called a naked bud. The minute underdeveloped leaves in such buds are often excessively hairy. Naked buds are found in some shrubs, like some species of the Sumac and Viburnums (&quot;Viburnum alnifolium&quot; and &quot;V. lantana&quot;) and in herbaceous plants. In many of the latter, buds are even more reduced, often consisting of undifferentiated masses of cells in the axils of leaves. A terminal bud occurs on the end of a stem and lateral buds are found on the side. A head of cabbage (see Brassica) is an exceptionally large terminal bud, while Brussels sprouts are large lateral buds.

Since buds are formed in the axils of leaves, their distribution on the stem is the same as that of leaves. There are alternate, opposite, and whorled buds, as well as the terminal bud at the tip of the stem. In many plants buds appear in unexpected places: these are known as adventitious buds.

Often it is possible to find a bud in a remarkable series of gradations of bud scales. In the buckeye, for example, one may see a complete gradation from the small brown outer scale through larger scales which on unfolding become somewhat green to the inner scales of the bud, which are remarkably leaf-like. Such a series suggests that the scales of the bud are in truth leaves, modified to protect the more delicate parts of the plant during unfavorable periods.

==Types of buds==
Buds are often useful in the identification of plants, especially for woody plants in winter when leaves have fallen. Buds may be classified and described according to different criteria: location, status, morphology, and function.

Botanists commonly use the following terms:
* for location:
** , when located at the tip of a stem (apical is equivalent but rather reserved for the one at the top of the plant);
** axillary, when located in the axil of a leaf (lateral is the equivalent but some adventitious buds may be lateral too);
** adventitious, when located elsewhere, for example on the trunk or roots (some adventitious buds may be former axillary ones that are reduced and hidden under the bark, while other adventitious buds are completely new formed ones).
* for status:
** accessory, for secondary buds formed besides a principal bud (axillary or terminal);
** resting, for a bud that forms at the end of a growth season, and then lies dormant until the onset of the next growth season;
** dormant or latent, for buds whose growth has been delayed for a rather long time. The term is usable as a synonym of &quot;resting&quot;, but is better employed for buds waiting undeveloped for years, for example epicormic buds;
** pseudoterminal, for an axillary bud taking over the function of a terminal bud (characteristic of species whose growth is sympodial: terminal bud dies and is replaced by the closer axillary bud, for examples beech, persimmon, &quot;Platanus&quot; have sympodial growth).
* for morphology:
** scaly or covered (perulate), when scales, also referred to as a perule (lat. perula, perulaei) (which are in fact transformed and reduced leaves) cover and protect the embryonic parts;
** naked, when not covered by scales;
** hairy, when also protected by hairs (it may apply either to scaly or to naked buds).
* for function:
** vegetative, only containing vegetative structures: a leaf bud is an embryonic shoot containing leaves;
** reproductive, only containing embryonic flower(s): a flower bud contains a single flower while an inflorescence bud contains an inflorescence;
** mixed, containing both embryonic leaves and flower(s).

<doc id="43607" wikidata="Q117054" url="?curid=43607" title="Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon">
<text>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon or Bacon&#x27;s Law is a parlor game where players challenge each other to arbitrarily choose an actor and then connect them to another actor via a film that both actors have appeared in together, repeating this process to try to find the shortest path that ultimately leads to prolific American actor Kevin Bacon. It rests on the assumption that anyone involved in the Hollywood film industry can be linked through their film roles to Bacon within six steps. The game&#x27;s name is a reference to &quot;six degrees of separation&quot;, a concept that posits that any two people on Earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart.

In 2007, Bacon started a charitable organization called SixDegrees.org. In 2020, Bacon started a podcast called &quot;The Last Degree of Kevin Bacon&quot;.

==History==
In a January 1994 interview with &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine, Kevin Bacon mentioned while discussing the film &quot;The River Wild&quot; that &quot;he had worked with everybody in Hollywood or someone who&#x27;s worked with them.&quot; Following this, a lengthy newsgroup thread which was headed &quot;Kevin Bacon is the Center of the Universe&quot; appeared. In 1994, three Albright College students - Craig Fass, Brian Turtle and Mike Ginelli - invented the game that became known as &quot;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&quot; after seeing two movies on television that featured Bacon back to back, &quot;Footloose&quot; and &quot;The Air Up There&quot;. During the latter film they began to speculate on how many movies Bacon had been in and the number of people with whom he had worked.

They wrote a letter to talk show host Jon Stewart, telling him that &quot;Kevin Bacon was the center of the entertainment universe&quot; and explaining the game. They appeared on &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; and &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; with Bacon to explain the game. Bacon admitted that he initially disliked the game because he believed it was ridiculing him, but he eventually came to enjoy it. The three inventors released a book, &quot;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&quot; (), with an introduction written by Bacon. A board game based on the concept was released by Endless Games.

==In popular culture==
In 1995 Cartoon Network referenced the concept in a commercial, having Velma (from Scooby-Doo) as the central figure in the &#x27;Cartoon Network Universe&#x27;. The commercial cites connections as arbitrary as fake appearances, sharing of clothes, or physical resemblance.

The concept was also presented in an episode of the TV show &quot;Mad About You&quot; dated November 19, 1996, in which a character expressed the opinion that every actor is only three degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon. Bacon spoofed the concept himself in a cameo he performed for the independent film &quot;We Married Margo&quot;. Playing himself in a 2003 episode of &quot;Will and Grace&quot;, Bacon connects himself to Val Kilmer through Tom Cruise and jokes &quot;Hey, that was a short one!&quot;. The headline of &quot;The Onion&quot;, a satirical newspaper, on October 30, 2002, was &quot;Kevin Bacon Linked To Al-Qaeda&quot;. Bacon provides the voice-over commentary for the NY Skyride attraction at the Empire State Building in New York City. At several points throughout the commentary, Bacon alludes to his connections to Hollywood stars via other actors with whom he has worked.

In &quot;Scream 2&quot;, written by Kevin Williamson, a sorority sister played by Portia De Rossi refers to Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. Bacon himself later starred in &quot;The Following&quot;, also created and written by Williamson, and broadcast on Fox between 2013 and 2015.

The annual &quot;31 Days of Oscar&quot; event on the Turner Classic Movies television channel sometimes includes a &quot;360 Degrees of Oscar&quot; strand where each film shown shares an actor with the previous one. It has been used as recently as 2020.

In 2009, Bacon narrated a National Geographic Channel show &quot;The Human Family Tree&quot; – a program which describes the efforts of that organization&#x27;s Genographic Project to establish the genetic interconnectedness of all humans. Bacon appeared in a commercial for the Visa check card that referenced the game. In the commercial, Bacon wants to write a check to buy a book, but the clerk asks for his ID, which he does not have. He leaves and returns with a group of people, then says to the clerk, &quot;Okay, I was in a movie with an extra, Eunice, whose hairdresser, Wayne, attended Sunday school with Father O&#x27;Neill, who plays racquetball with Dr. Sanjay, who recently removed the appendix of Kim, who dumped you sophomore year. So you see, we&#x27;re practically brothers.&quot;

In 2011, James Franco made reference to Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon while hosting the 83rd Academy Awards. EE began a UK television advertising campaign in November 2012, based on the Six Degrees concept, where Bacon illustrates his connections and draws attention to how the EE 4G network allows similar connectivity.

In &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;Lame Claim to Fame&quot;, one of the lines is, &quot;I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows Kevin Bacon.&quot; American rapper MC Zappa also makes reference to the game in his 2018 song &quot;Level Up (The Ill Cypher)&quot;.

The most highly connected nodes of the Internet have been referred to as &quot;the Kevin Bacons of the Web&quot;, inasmuch as they enable most users to navigate to most sites in 19 clicks or less.

== Bacon numbers ==

The Bacon number of an actor is the number of degrees of separation they have from Kevin Bacon, as defined by the game. This is an application of the Erdős number concept to the Hollywood movie industry. The higher the Bacon number, the greater the separation from Kevin Bacon the actor is.

The computation of a Bacon number for actor X is a &quot;shortest path&quot; algorithm, applied to the co-stardom network:
* Kevin Bacon himself has a Bacon number of 0.
* Actors who have worked directly with Kevin Bacon have a Bacon number of 1.
* If the lowest Bacon number of any actor with whom X has appeared in any movie is N, X&#x27;s Bacon number is N+1.

===Examples===

* Elvis Presley was in &quot;Change of Habit&quot; (1969) with Ed Asner. Ed Asner was in &quot;JFK&quot; (1991) with Kevin Bacon. Therefore, Asner has a Bacon number of 1, and Presley (who never appeared in a film with Bacon) has a Bacon number of 2.

* Ian McKellen was in &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014) with Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy. McAvoy and Fassbender were in &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011) with Kevin Bacon. Therefore, McAvoy and Fassbender have Bacon numbers of 1, and McKellen has a Bacon number of 2.

Because some people have both a finite Bacon &quot;and&quot; a finite Erdős number because of acting and publications, there are a rare few who have a finite Erdős–Bacon number, which is defined as the sum of a person&#x27;s independent Erdős and Bacon numbers.

== Photography book ==
Inspired by the game, the British photographer Andy Gotts tried to reach Kevin Bacon through photographic links instead of film links.

Gotts wrote to 300 actors asking to take their pictures and received permission only from Joss Ackland. Ackland then suggested that Gotts photograph Greta Scacchi, with whom he had appeared in the film &quot;White Mischief&quot;. Gotts proceeded from there, asking each actor to refer him to one or more friends or colleagues. Eventually, Christian Slater referred him to Bacon. Gotts&#x27; photograph of Bacon completed the project, eight years after it began. Gotts published the photos in a book, &quot;Degrees&quot; (), with text by Alan Bates, Pierce Brosnan, and Bacon.

<doc id="43608" wikidata="Q582285" url="?curid=43608" title="William Rufus Shafter">
<text>William Rufus Shafter (October 16, 1835 – November 12, 1906) was a Union Army officer during the American Civil War who received America&#x27;s highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions at the Battle of Fair Oaks. Shafter also played a prominent part as a major general in the Spanish–American War. Fort Shafter, Hawaii, is named for him, as well as the city of Shafter, California and the ghost town of Shafter, Texas. He was nicknamed &quot;Pecos Bill&quot;, inspiration for the fictional character of the same name in tall tales.

==Early life==
Shafter was born in Galesburg, Michigan on October 16, 1835. His ancestors were of Scots-Irish descent and originally were settlers in Vermont. On his father&#x27;s side, the family was of Scots-Irish descent, as his ancestor came from Northern Ireland and Scotland, arriving in Massachusetts in the year 1670. Subsequently, the Shafters later settled in Vermont.

==American Civil War and Indian Wars==
Shafter served as a 1st lieutenant the U.S. Army&#x27;s 7th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment at the battles of Ball&#x27;s Bluff and Fair Oaks. He was wounded at the Battle of Fair Oaks and later received the Medal of Honor for heroism during the battle. He led a charge on the first day of the battle and was wounded towards the close of that day&#x27;s fighting. In order to stay with his regiment he concealed his wounds, fighting on the second day of the battle. On August 22, 1862, he was mustered out of the volunteer service but returned to the field as major in the 19th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He was captured at the Battle of Thompson&#x27;s Station and spent three months in a Confederate prison. In April 1864 after his release he was appointed colonel of the 17th United States Colored Infantry and led the regiment at the Battle of Nashville.

By the end of the war, he had been promoted to brevet brigadier general of volunteers. He stayed in the regular army when the war ended. During his subsequent service in the Indian Wars, he received his &quot;Pecos Bill&quot; nickname. He led the 24th Infantry, another United States Colored Troops regiment, in campaigns against the Cheyenne, Comanche, Kickapoo and Kiowa Indian warriors in Texas. While commander of Fort Davis, he started a controversial court-martial of second lieutenant Henry Flipper, the first black cadet to graduate from West Point. In May 1897 he was appointed as a brigadier general.

==Spanish–American War==

Just before the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Shafter was commander of the Department of California. Shafter was an unlikely candidate for command of the expedition to Cuba. He was approaching 63, weighed over 300 pounds and suffered from gout. Nevertheless, he received a promotion to Major General of Volunteers and command of the Fifth Army Corps being assembled in Tampa, Florida. One possible reason for his being given this command was his lack of political ambitions.

Shafter appeared to maintain a very loose control over the expedition to Cuba from the beginning, commencing with a very disorganized landing at Daiquiri on the southern coast of Cuba. Confusion prevailed over landing priorities and the chain of command. When General Sumner refused to allow the Army&#x27;s Gatling Gun Detachment - which had priority - to disembark from the transport &quot;Cherokee&quot; on the grounds that the lieutenant commanding the detachment did not have the rank to enforce his priority, Shafter had to personally intervene, returning to the ship in a steam launch to enforce his demand that the guns come off immediately.

During the disembarkation, Shafter sent forward Fifth Corps&#x27; Cavalry Division under Joseph Wheeler to reconnoiter the road to Santiago de Cuba. Apparently disregarding orders, Wheeler brought on a fight which escalated into the Battle of Las Guasimas. Shafter apparently did not realize the battle was even underway nor did he say anything to Wheeler about it afterward.

A plan was finally developed for the attack on Santiago. Shafter would send his 1st Division (at the time, brigade and division numbers were not unique outside their parent formation) to attack El Caney while his 2nd Division and the Cavalry Division would attack the heights south of El Caney known as San Juan Hill. Originally, Shafter planned to lead his forces from the front, but he suffered greatly from the tropical heat and was confined to his headquarters far to the rear and out of sight of the fighting. Unable to see the battle firsthand, he never developed a coherent chain of command. Shafter&#x27;s offensive battle plans were both simplistic and extremely vague. He seemed to be unaware or unconcerned about the mass killing effect of modern military weapons technology possessed by the Spanish. Further, his intelligence-gathering efforts on Spanish troop dispositions and equipment was extremely meager, though he had a number of sources available to him, including reconnaissance reports by Cuban rebel forces as well as espionage obtained from indigenous Cubans.

During the hurried attack on El Caney and San Juan Heights, American forces, who had packed the available roads and were unable maneuver, suffered heavy losses from Spanish troops equipped with modern repeating smokeless powder rifles and breech-loading artillery, while the short-ranged black-powder guns of U.S. artillery units were unable to respond effectively. Additional casualties were incurred in the actual assault, which was marked by a series of brave but disorganized and uncoordinated advances. After suffering some 1,400 casualties, and aided by a single Gatling Gun detachment for fire support, American troops successfully stormed and occupied both El Caney and San Juan Heights.

The next task for Shafter was the investment and siege of the city of Santiago and its garrison. However, the extent of the American losses were becoming known at Shafter&#x27;s headquarters back at Sevilla (his gout, poor physical condition, and huge bulk did not allow him to go to the front). The casualties were delivered not only by messenger report, but also by &quot;meat wagons&quot; delivering the wounded and dying to the hospital. Viewing the carnage, Shafter began to waver in his determination to defeat the Spanish at Santiago. He knew his troops&#x27; position was tenuous, but again had little intelligence on the hardships of the Spanish inside beleaguered Santiago. Shafter felt the Navy was doing little to relieve the pressure on his forces. Supplies could not be delivered to the front, leaving his men in want of necessities, particularly food rations. Shafter himself was ill, and very weak. With this view of events, Shafter sent a dramatic message to Washington. He suggested that the army should give up its attack and all its gains for the day, and withdraw to safer ground about five miles away. Fortunately, by the time this message reached Washington, Shafter changed his mind, and instead renewed siege operations after demanding the Spanish surrender the city and garrison of Santiago. With the victory of the U.S. Navy at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, by Admirals William T. Sampson and Winfield Scott Schley, the fate of the Spanish position at Santiago was sealed. Shortly afterward, the Spanish commander surrendered the city.

&#x27;Campaigning in Cuba&#x27; by George Kennan, 1899 (available on Gutenberg) presents a totally damning account of Shafter&#x27;s command in the Cuba campaign by a gifted correspondent who was with the troops from Tampa to return:

==Postwar career and retirement==

With disease rampant in the American army in Cuba, Shafter and many of his officers favored a quick withdrawal from Cuba. Shafter personally left Cuba in September 1898. And after a stay in quarantine at Camp Wikoff, Shafter returned to serve as Commander of the Department of California from May 1897 through February 1901.

As Commander he oversaw the supplying of the Army&#x27;s expedition to the Philippines, which escalated into the Philippine–American War during the last years of Shafter&#x27;s career. Hostilities broke out on February 4, 1899, and the war lasted through July 2, 1902, past Shafter&#x27;s retirement. When the war was three months old, the Commander shared his views with the Chicago News:

Shafter reiterated his opinion in January 1900: &quot;My plan would be to disarm the natives of the Philippine Islands, even if I have to kill half of them to do it. Then I would treat the rest of them with perfect justice.&quot;

Shafter was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, the Military Order of Foreign Wars and the Sons of the American Revolution.

Shafter retired in 1901 to a farm next to his daughter&#x27;s land in Bakersfield, California. He died there in 1906 and is buried at San Francisco National Cemetery.

==In popular culture==
Shafter was portrayed by Rodger Boyce in the 1997 film &quot;Rough Riders&quot;. Shafter appeared in the 1898 film &quot;Surrender of General Toral&quot;.

Shafter is also notable for the fact that he has the highest known Bacon Number in the parlor game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, at 10.

==Medal of Honor citation==

<text>Jumping or leaping is a form of locomotion or movement in which an organism or non-living (e.g., robotic) mechanical system propels itself through the air along a ballistic trajectory. Jumping can be distinguished from running, galloping and other gaits where the entire body is temporarily airborne, by the relatively long duration of the aerial phase and high angle of initial launch.

Some animals, such as the kangaroo, employ jumping (commonly called &quot;hopping&quot; in this instance) as their primary form of an locomotion, while others, such as frogs, use it only as a means to escape predators. Jumping is also a key feature of various activities and sports, including the long jump, high jump and show jumping.

==Physics==
All jumping involves the application of force against a substrate, which in turn generates a reactive force that propels the jumper away from the substrate. Any solid or liquid capable of producing an opposing force can serve as a substrate, including ground or water. Examples of the latter include dolphins performing traveling jumps, and Indian skitter frogs executing standing jumps from water.

Jumping organisms are rarely subject to significant aerodynamic forces and, as a result, their jumps are governed by the basic physical laws of ballistic trajectories. Consequently, while a bird may jump into the air to initiate flight, no movement it performs once airborne is considered jumping, as the initial jump conditions no longer dictate its flight path.

Following the moment of launch (i.e., initial loss of contact with the substrate), a jumper will traverse a parabolic path. The launch angle and initial launch velocity determine the travel distance, duration, and height of the jump. The maximum possible horizontal travel distance for a projectile occurs at a launch angle of 45°, but any launch angle between 35° and 55° will result in ninety percent of the maximum possible distance. However, the jump angle for humans which maximizes horizontal distance travelled is lower at ~23-26° (see section &quot;Standing long jump mechanics&quot; below).
Muscles (or other actuators in non-living systems) do physical work, adding kinetic energy to the jumper&#x27;s body over the course of a jump&#x27;s propulsive phase. This results in a kinetic energy at launch that is proportional to the square of the jumper&#x27;s speed. The more work the muscles do, the greater the launch velocity and thus the greater the acceleration and the shorter the time interval of the jump&#x27;s propulsive phase.

Mechanical power (work per unit time) and the distance over which that power is applied (e.g., leg length) are the key determinants of jump distance and height. As a result, many jumping animals have long legs and muscles that are optimized for maximal power according to the force-velocity relationship of muscles. The maximum power output of muscles is limited, however. To circumvent this limitation, many jumping species slowly pre-stretch elastic elements, such as tendons or apodemes, to store work as strain energy. Such elastic elements can release energy at a much higher rate (higher power) than equivalent muscle mass, thus increasing launch energy to levels beyond what muscle alone is capable of.

A jumper may be either stationary or moving when initiating a jump. In a jump from stationary (i.e., a &quot;standing jump&quot;), all of the work required to accelerate the body through launch is done in a single movement. In a &quot;moving jump&quot; or &quot;running jump&quot;, the jumper introduces additional vertical velocity at launch while conserving as much horizontal momentum as possible. Unlike stationary jumps, in which the jumper&#x27;s kinetic energy at launch is solely due to the jump movement, moving jumps have a higher energy that results from the inclusion of the horizontal velocity preceding the jump. Consequently, jumpers are able to jump greater distances when starting from a run.

==Anatomy==
Animals use a wide variety of anatomical adaptations for jumping. These adaptations are exclusively concerned with the launch, as any post-launch method of extending range or controlling the jump must use aerodynamic forces, and thus is considered gliding or parachuting.

Aquatic species rarely display any particular specializations for jumping. Those that are good jumpers usually are primarily adapted for speed, and execute moving jumps by simply swimming to the surface at a high velocity. A few primarily aquatic species that can jump while on land, such as mud skippers, do so via a flick of the tail.

===Limb morphology===

In terrestrial animals, the primary propulsive structure is the legs, though a few species use their tails. Typical characteristics of jumping species include long legs, large leg muscles, and additional limb elements.

Long legs increase the time and distance over which a jumping animal can push against the substrate, thus allowing more power and faster, farther jumps. Large leg muscles can generate greater force, resulting in improved jumping performance. In addition to elongated leg elements, many jumping animals have modified foot and ankle bones that are elongated and possess additional joints, effectively adding more segments to the limb and even more length.

Frogs are an excellent example of all three trends: frog legs can be nearly twice the body length, leg muscles may account for up to twenty percent of body weight, and they have not only lengthened the foot, shin and thigh, but extended the ankle bones into another limb joint and similarly extended the hip bones and gained mobility at the sacrum for a second &#x27;extra joint&#x27;. As a result, frogs are the undisputed champion jumpers of vertebrates, leaping over fifty body lengths, a distance of more than eight feet.

===Power amplification through stored energy===
Grasshoppers use elastic energy storage to increase jumping distance. Although power output is a principal determinant of jump distance (as noted above), physiological constraints limit muscle power to approximately 375 Watts per kilogram of muscle. To overcome this limitation, grasshoppers anchor their legs via an internal &quot;catch mechanism&quot; while their muscles stretch an elastic apodeme (similar to a vertebrate tendon). When the catch is released, the apodeme rapidly releases its energy. Because the apodeme releases energy more quickly than muscle, its power output exceeds that of the muscle that produced the energy.
This is analogous to a human throwing an arrow by hand versus using a bow; the use of elastic storage (the bow) allows the muscles to operate closer to isometric on the force-velocity curve. This enables the muscles to do work over a longer time and thus produce more energy than they otherwise could, while the elastic element releases that work faster than the muscles can. The use of elastic energy storage has been found in jumping mammals as well as in frogs, with commensurate increases in power ranging from two to seven times that of equivalent muscle mass.

==Classification==

One way to classify jumping is by the manner of foot transfer. In this classification system, five basic jump forms are distinguished:
* Jump – jumping from and landing on two feet
* Hop – jumping from one foot and landing on the same foot
* Leap – jumping from one foot and landing on the other foot
* Assemblé – jumping from one foot and landing on two feet
* Sissonne – jumping from two feet and landing on one foot

Leaping gaits, which are distinct from running gaits (see Locomotion), include cantering, galloping, and stotting or pronging. Some sources also distinguish bounding as a cyclical motion of repeated jumps, used to maintain energy from one jump to the next.

== Standing long jump mechanics ==

The optimal take off angle for a standing long jump (performed by a human) has been theoretically calculated to be ~22.6°, substantially lower than the optimal take off angle for a projectile (i.e. 45°). This is due to take-off speed decreasing with take-off angle due to the jumper&#x27;s body configuration. It has been shown that experienced parkour athletes use a take off angle of ~25.6°, whereas beginner traceurs use an angle of ~ 34°. Experienced athletes also swing their arms to a greater extent and rock backwards before taking off. These factors help parkour athletes to carry out longer standing long jumps than beginners.

The (official) male standing long jump world record is 371 cm, and the female record is 292 cm (both as of June 2023). These were achieved by Arne Tvervaag and Annelin Mannes respectively. Standing long jump distances range between 146.2 cm and 219.8 cm (10th to 90th percentile) for 18-year-old men, and between 100 cm and 157 cm for 18-year-old women.

==Height-enhancing devices and techniques==
The height of a jump may be increased by using a trampoline or by converting horizontal velocity into vertical velocity with the aid of a device such as a half pipe.

Various exercises can be used to increase an athlete&#x27;s vertical jumping height. One category of such exercises—plyometrics—employs repetition of discrete jumping-related movements to increase speed, agility, and power.

It has been shown in research that children who are more physically active display more proficient jumping (along with other basic motor skill) patterns.

It is also noted that jumping development in children has a direct relationship with age. As children grow older, it is seen that their jumping abilities in all forms also increase. Jumping development is more easily identifiable in children rather than adults due to the fact that there are less physical differences at a younger age. Adults of the same age may be vastly different in terms of physicality and athleticism making it difficult to see how age affects jumping ability.

In 2021, researchers incorporated ratchets into a robot design and created a robot capable of jumping over thirty meters vertically.

<doc id="43611" wikidata="Q2528142" url="?curid=43611" title="Hari">
<text>Hari () is among the primary epithets of the Hindu preserver deity Vishnu, meaning &#x27;the one who takes away&#x27; (sins). It refers to the one who removes darkness and illusion, the one who removes all obstacles to spiritual progress. 

The name Hari also appears as the 650th name of Vishnu in the Vishnu Sahasranama of the Mahabharata and is considered to be of great significance in Vaishnavism.

==Etymology==
The Sanskrit word &quot;&quot; (Hari) is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*&quot;&quot; to shine; to flourish; green; yellow&quot; which also gave rise to the Persian terms &quot;zar&quot; &#x27;gold&#x27;, Greek &quot;khloros&quot; &#x27;green&#x27;, Slavic &quot;zelen&quot; &#x27;green&#x27; and &quot;zolto&quot; &#x27;gold&#x27;, as well as the English words &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;gold&quot;.

The same root occurs in other Sanskrit words like &quot;&quot;, &#x27;turmeric&#x27;, named for its yellow color.

In Hinduism, beginning with Adi Sankara&#x27;s commentary on the Vishnu sahasranama, &quot;hari&quot; became etymologized as derived from the verbal root &quot;hṛ&quot; &quot;to grab, seize, steal&quot;, in the context of Vaishnavism interpreted as &quot;to take away or remove evil or sin&quot;, and the name of Vishnu rendered as &quot;he who destroys samsara&quot;, which is the entanglement in the cycle of birth and death, along with ignorance, its cause; compare &quot;hara&quot; as a name of Shiva, translated as &quot;seizer&quot; or &quot;destroyer&quot;.

==In Indian religions==

=== In Hinduism ===
*The Harivamsha (&quot;lineage of Hari&quot;) is a text in both the Purana and Itihasa traditions.
* As the name of tawny-colored animals, &quot;hari&quot; may refer to lions (also a name of the zodiacal sign Leo), bay horses, or monkeys. The feminine &quot;Harī &quot; is the name of the mythological &quot;mother of monkeys&quot; in the Sanskrit epics.
* Harihara is the name of a fused deity form of both Vishnu (Hari) and Shiva (Hara) in Hinduism.
* Hari is the name of a class of gods under the fourth Manu (&quot;manu tāmasa&quot;, &quot;Dark Manu&quot;) in the Puranas.
* Haridasa is the Hari-centered bhakti movement from Karnataka.
* In the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, Hari is a name of both Krishna and Vishnu, invoked in the Hare Krishna mahamantra (Hare could be a vocative form of Hari).
* The Hari Stuti is a hymn in praise of Vishnu composed by Adi Shankara.
* The Hari Stotra is a Sanskrit hymn.
* &quot;Hari Om&quot; is a mantra and greeting.

=== In Sikhism ===
The name &quot;ਹਰਿ&quot; (Hari) is frequently used as a name for Waheguru in the &quot;Sri Guru Granth Sahib&quot;:ਹਰਿ ਹਰਿ ਹਰਿ ਹਰਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਹੈ ਗੁਰਮੁਖਿ ਪਾਵੈ ਕੋਇ ॥

Hari, Hari, Hari, Hari is the Name (of the Lord); rare are those who, as Gurmukh, obtain it. (SGGS, Ang.1313)In the &quot;Varan Bhai Gurdas&quot;, an early explanation and interpretation of Sikh theology, Bhai Gurdas also associates the name &quot;ਹਰਿ&quot; (Hari) in the form of Hari Krishan in the Dwapur Yuga with the letter &quot;ਹ&quot; (h) in &quot;ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂ&quot; (Waheguru).

However, in the context of the &quot;Sri Guru Granth Sahib&quot;, the name &quot;Hari&quot; refers to the one monotheistic God of Sikhism, as similar to &quot;Hari&quot; is used in Vaishnavism for Parabrahman as well. However Sarabloh Granth and Dasam Granth call Krishna as Hari several times. Krishna creates several Krishna during his avatar during Ras Leela which is what Guru Ram Das mentioned in Adi Granth that Hari himself creates several Kanha for the Gopis and he himself becomes those Gopis.

<text>A pension (; ) is a fund into which amounts are paid regularly during an individual&#x27;s working career, and from which periodic payments are made to support the person&#x27;s retirement from work. A pension may be:
* a &quot;defined benefit plan&quot;, where defined periodic payments are made in retirement. The sponsor of the scheme (e.g. the employer) must make further payments into the fund if necessary to support these defined retirement payments, or
* a &quot;defined contribution plan&quot;, under which defined amounts are paid in during working life, and the retirement payments are whatever can be afforded from the fund.

Pensions should not be confused with severance pay; the former is usually paid in regular amounts for life after retirement, while the latter is typically paid as a fixed amount after involuntary termination of employment before retirement.

The terms &quot;retirement plan&quot; and &quot;superannuation&quot; tend to refer to a pension granted upon retirement of the individual; the terminology varies between countries. Retirement plans may be set up by employers, insurance companies, the government, or other institutions such as employer associations or trade unions. Called &quot;retirement plans&quot; in the United States, they are commonly known as &quot;pension schemes&quot; in the United Kingdom and Ireland and &quot;superannuation plans&quot; (or &quot;super&quot;) in Australia and New Zealand. Retirement pensions are typically in the form of a guaranteed life annuity, thus insuring against the risk of longevity.

A pension created by an employer for the benefit of an employee is commonly referred to as an occupational or employer pension. Labor unions, the government, or other organizations may also fund pensions. Occupational pensions are a form of deferred compensation, usually advantageous to employee and employer for tax reasons. Many pensions also contain an additional insurance aspect, since they often will pay benefits to survivors or disabled beneficiaries. Other vehicles (certain lottery payouts, for example, or an annuity) may provide a similar stream of payments.

The common use of the term &quot;pension&quot; is to describe the payments a person receives upon retirement, usually under predetermined legal or contractual terms. A recipient of a retirement pension is known as a &quot;pensioner&quot; or &quot;retiree&quot;.

==Types==

===Employment-based pensions===
A retirement plan is an arrangement to provide people with an income during retirement when they are no longer earning a steady income from employment. Often retirement plans require both the employer and employee to contribute money to a fund during their employment in order to receive defined benefits upon retirement. It is a tax deferred savings vehicle that allows for the tax-free accumulation of a fund for later use as retirement income. Funding can be provided in other ways, such as from labor unions, government agencies, or self-funded schemes. Pension plans are therefore a form of &quot;deferred compensation&quot;. A SSAS is a type of employment-based Pension in the UK. The 401(k) is the iconic self-funded retirement plan that many Americans rely on for much of their retirement income; these sometimes include money from an employer, but are usually mostly or entirely funded by the individual using an elaborate scheme where money from the employee&#x27;s paycheck is withheld, at their direction, to be contributed by their employer to the employee&#x27;s plan. This money can be tax-deferred or not, depending on the exact nature of the plan.

====Military====
Some countries also grant pensions to military veterans. Military pensions are overseen by the government; an example of a standing agency is the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. &quot;Ad hoc&quot; committees may also be formed to investigate specific tasks, such as the U.S. Commission on Veterans&#x27; Pensions (commonly known as the &quot;Bradley Commission&quot;) in 1955–56. Pensions may extend past the death of the veteran himself, continuing to be paid to the widow.

In the U.S., retired military receive a &quot;military retirement pay&quot;, not called a &quot;pension&quot; as they can be recalled to active duty at any time. Military retirement pay is calculated on number of years on active duty, final pay grade and the retirement system in place when they entered service. Members awarded the Medal of Honor qualify for a separate stipend. Retirement pay for military members in the reserve and US National Guard is based on a point system. 

===Social and state pensions===
Many countries have created funds for their citizens and residents to provide income when they retire (or in some cases become disabled). Typically this requires payments throughout the citizen&#x27;s working life in order to qualify for benefits later on. A basic state pension is a &quot;contribution based&quot; benefit, and depends on an individual&#x27;s contribution history. For examples, see National Insurance in the UK, or Social Security in the United States of America.

Many countries have also put in place a &quot;social pension&quot;. These are regular, tax-funded non-contributory cash transfers paid to older people. Over 80 countries have social pensions. Some are universal benefits, given to all older people regardless of income, assets or employment record. Examples of universal pensions include New Zealand Superannuation and the Basic Retirement Pension of Mauritius. Most social pensions, though, are means-tested, such as Supplemental Security Income in the United States of America or the &quot;older person&#x27;s grant&quot; in South Africa.

===Disability pensions===

Some pension plans will provide for members in the event they suffer a disability. This may take the form of early entry into a retirement plan for a disabled member below the normal retirement age.

==Benefits==
The benefits of defined benefit and defined contribution plans differ based on the degree of financial security provided to the retiree. With defined benefit plans, retirees receive a guaranteed payout at retirement, determined by a fixed formula based on factors such as salary and years of service. The risk and responsibility of ensuring sufficient funding through retirement is borne by the employer or plan managers. This type of plan provides a level of financial security for retirees, ensuring they will receive a specific amount of income throughout their retirement years. However this income is not usually guaranteed to keep up with inflation, so its purchasing power may decline over the years.

On the other hand, defined contribution plans are dependent upon the amount of money contributed and the performance of the investment vehicles used. Employees are responsible for ensuring that their contributions are sufficient to provide for their retirement needs, and they face the risk of market fluctuations that could reduce their retirement savings. However, defined contribution plans provide more flexibility for employees, who can choose how much to contribute and how to invest their funds.

Hybrid plans, such as cash balance and pension equity plans, combine features of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. These plans have become increasingly popular in the U.S. since the 1990s. Cash balance plans, for example, provide a guaranteed benefit like a defined benefit plan, but the benefit is expressed as an account balance, like a defined contribution plan. Pension equity plans are a type of cash balance plan that credits employee accounts with a percentage of their pay each year, similar to a defined contribution plan.

==Defined benefit plans==

A Defined Benefit (DB) pension plan is a plan in which workers accrue pension rights during their time at a firm and upon retirement the firm pays them a benefit that is a function of that worker&#x27;s tenure at the firm and of their earnings. In other words, a DB plan is a plan in which the benefit on retirement is determined by a set formula, rather than depending on investment returns. Government pensions such as Social Security in the United States are a type of defined benefit pension plan. Traditionally, defined benefit plans for employers have been administered by institutions which exist specifically for that purpose, by large businesses, or, for government workers, by the government itself. A traditional form of defined benefit plan is the &quot;final salary&quot; plan, under which the pension paid is equal to the number of years worked, multiplied by the member&#x27;s salary at retirement, multiplied by a factor known as the &quot;accrual rate&quot;. The final accrued amount is available as a monthly pension or a lump sum, but usually monthly.

In the US, specifies a defined benefit plan to be any pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan (see below) where a defined contribution plan is any plan with individual accounts. A traditional pension plan that &quot;defines&quot; a &quot;benefit&quot; for an employee upon that employee&#x27;s retirement is a defined benefit plan. In the U.S., corporate defined benefit plans, along with many other types of defined benefit plans, are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

In the United Kingdom, benefits are typically indexed for inflation (known as Retail Prices Index (RPI)) as required by law for registered pension plans. Inflation during an employee&#x27;s retirement affects the purchasing power of the pension; the higher the inflation rate, the lower the purchasing power of a fixed annual pension. This effect can be mitigated by providing annual increases to the pension at the rate of inflation (usually capped, for instance at 5% in any given year). This method is advantageous for the employee since it stabilizes the purchasing power of pensions to some extent.

If the pension plan allows for early retirement, payments are often reduced to recognize that the retirees will receive the payouts for longer periods of time. In the United States, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, any reduction factor less than or equal to the actuarial early retirement reduction factor is acceptable.

Many DB plans include early retirement provisions to encourage employees to retire early, before the attainment of normal retirement age (usually age 65). Companies would rather hire younger employees at lower wages. Some of those provisions come in the form of additional &quot;temporary&quot; or &quot;supplemental benefits&quot;, which are payable to a certain age, usually before attaining normal retirement age.

Due to changes in pensions over the years, many pension systems, including those in Alabama, California, Indiana, and New York, have shifted to a tiered system. For a simplified example, suppose there are three employees that pay into a state pension system: Sam, Veronica, and Jessica. The state pension system has three tiers: Tier I, Tier II, and Tier III. These three tiers are based on the employee&#x27;s hire date (i.e. Tier I covers 1 January 1980 (and before) to 1 January 1995, Tier II 2 January 1995 to 1 January 2010, and Tier III 1 January 2010 to present) and have different benefit provisions (e.g. Tier I employees can retire at age 50 with 80% benefits or wait until 55 with full benefits, Tier II employees can retire at age 55 with 80% benefits or wait until 60 for full benefits, Tier III employees can retire at age 65 with full benefits). Therefore, Sam, hired in June 1983, would be subject to the provisions of the Tier I scheme, whereas Veronica, hired in August 1995, would be permitted to retire at age 60 with full benefits and Jessica, hired in December 2014, would not be able to retire with full benefits until she became 65.

===Criticisms===

Traditional defined benefit plan designs (because of their typically flat accrual rate and the decreasing time for interest discounting as people get closer to retirement age) tend to exhibit a J-shaped accrual pattern of benefits, where the present value of benefits grows quite slowly early in an employee&#x27;s career and accelerates significantly in mid-career: in other words it costs more to fund the pension for older employees than for younger ones (an &quot;age bias&quot;). Defined benefit pensions tend to be less portable than defined contribution plans, even if the plan allows a lump sum cash benefit at termination. Most plans, however, pay their benefits as an annuity, so retirees do not bear the risk of low investment returns on contributions or of outliving their retirement income. The open-ended nature of these risks to the employer is the reason given by many employers for switching from defined benefit to defined contribution plans over recent years. The risks to the employer can sometimes be mitigated by discretionary elements in the benefit structure, for instance in the rate of increase granted on accrued pensions, both before and after retirement.

The age bias, reduced portability and open ended risk make defined benefit plans better suited to large employers with less mobile workforces, such as the public sector (which has open-ended support from taxpayers). This coupled with a lack of foresight on the employers part means a large proportion of the workforce are kept in the dark over future investment schemes.

Defined benefit plans are sometimes criticized as being paternalistic as they enable employers or plan trustees to make decisions about the type of benefits and family structures and lifestyles of their employees. However they are typically more valuable than defined contribution plans in most circumstances and for most employees (mainly because the employer tends to pay higher contributions than under defined contribution plans), so such criticism is rarely harsh.

The &quot;cost&quot; of a defined benefit plan is not easily calculated, and requires an actuary or actuarial software. However, even with the best of tools, the cost of a defined benefit plan will always be an estimate based on economic and financial assumptions. These assumptions include the average retirement age and lifespan of the employees, the returns to be earned by the pension plan&#x27;s investments and any additional taxes or levies, such as those required by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in the U.S. So, for this arrangement, the benefit is relatively secure but the contribution is uncertain even when estimated by a professional. This has serious cost considerations and risks for the employer offering a pension plan.

One of the growing concerns with defined benefit plans is that the level of future obligations will outpace the value of assets held by the plan (Unfunded mandate). This &quot;underfunding&quot; dilemma can be faced by any type of defined benefit plan, private or public, but it is most acute in governmental and other public plans where political pressures and less rigorous accounting standards can result in excessive commitments to employees and retirees, but inadequate contributions. Many states and municipalities across the United States of America and Canada now face chronic pension crises.

==Defined contribution plans==

A defined contribution (DC) plan, is a pension plan where employers set aside a certain proportion (i.e. contributions) of a worker&#x27;s earnings (such as 5%) in an investment account, and the worker receives this savings and any accumulated investment earnings upon retirement. These contributions are paid into an individual account for each member. The contributions are invested, for example in the stock market, and the returns on the investment (which may be positive or negative) are credited to the individual&#x27;s account. On retirement, the member&#x27;s account is used to provide retirement benefits, sometimes through the purchase of an annuity which then provides a regular income. Defined contribution plans have become widespread all over the world in recent years, and are now the dominant form of plan in the private sector in many countries. For example, the number of defined benefit plans in the U.S. has been steadily declining, as more and more employers see pension contributions as a large expense avoidable by disbanding the defined benefit plan and instead offering a defined contribution plan.

Money contributed can either be from employee salary deferral or from employer contributions. The portability of defined contribution pensions is legally no different from the portability of defined benefit plans. However, because of the cost of administration and ease of determining the plan sponsor&#x27;s liability for defined contribution plans (you do not need to pay an actuary to calculate the lump sum equivalent that you do for defined benefit plans) in practice, defined contribution plans have become generally portable.

In a defined contribution plan, investment risk and investment rewards are assumed by each individual/employee/retiree and not by the sponsor/employer, and these risks may be substantial. In addition, participants do not necessarily purchase annuities with their savings upon retirement, and bear the risk of outliving their assets. (In the United Kingdom, for instance, it is a legal requirement to use the bulk of the fund to purchase an annuity.)

The &quot;cost&quot; of a defined contribution plan is readily calculated, but the benefit from a defined contribution plan depends upon the account balance at the time an employee is looking to use the assets. So, for this arrangement, the &quot;contribution is known&quot; but the &quot;benefit is unknown&quot; (until calculated).

Despite the fact that the participant in a defined contribution plan typically has control over investment decisions, the plan sponsor retains a significant degree of fiduciary responsibility over investment of plan assets, including the selection of investment options and administrative providers.

===Examples===
In the United States, the legal definition of a defined contribution plan is a plan providing for an individual account for each participant, and for benefits based solely on the amount contributed to the account, plus or minus income, gains, expenses and losses allocated to the account (see ). Examples of defined contribution plans in the United States include individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans. In such plans, the employee is responsible, to one degree or another, for selecting the types of investments toward which the funds in the retirement plan are allocated. This may range from choosing one of a small number of pre-determined mutual funds to selecting individual stocks or other financial assets. Most self-directed retirement plans are characterized by certain tax advantages, and some provide for a portion of the employee&#x27;s contributions to be matched by the employer. In exchange, the funds in such plans may not be withdrawn by the investor prior to reaching a certain age—typically the year the employee reaches 59.5 years old (with a small number of exceptions)—without incurring a substantial penalty.

Advocates of defined contribution plans point out that each employee has the ability to tailor the investment portfolio to his or her individual needs and financial situation, including the choice of how much to contribute, if anything at all. However, others state that these apparent advantages could also hinder some workers who might not possess the financial savvy to choose the correct investment vehicles or have the discipline to voluntarily contribute money to retirement accounts.

In the US, defined contribution plans are subject to IRS limits on how much can be contributed, known as the section 415 limit. In 2009, the total deferral amount, including employee contribution plus employer contribution, was limited to $49,000 or 100% of compensation, whichever is less. The employee-only limit in 2009 was $16,500 with a $5,500 catch-up. These numbers usually increase each year and are indexed to compensate for the effects of inflation. For 2015, the limits were raised to $53,000 and $18,000, respectively.

Examples of defined contribution pension schemes in other countries are, the UK&#x27;s personal pensions and proposed National Employment Savings Trust (NEST), Germany&#x27;s Riester plans, Australia&#x27;s Superannuation system and New Zealand&#x27;s KiwiSaver scheme. Individual pension savings plans also exist in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain.

==Risk sharing pensions==
Many developed economies are moving beyond DB &amp; DC Plans and are adopting a new breed of collective risk sharing schemes where plan members pool their contributions and to a greater or less extent share the investment and longevity risk.

There are multiple naming conventions for these plans reflecting the fact that the future payouts are a &quot;target&quot; or &quot;ambition&quot; of the plan sponsor rather than a guarantee, common naming conventions include: 
* Defined Ambition Plans
* Target benefit plans
* Collective Defined Contribution Schemes
* Tontine Pensions

===Risk sharing pension sponsor examples===
* US: State of Wisconsin Investment Board
* US: TIAA
* UK: Royal Mail Pension Fund 
* Netherlands: Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP
* Denmark: Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension

==Financing==

Defined contribution pensions, by definition, are funded, as the &quot;guarantee&quot; made to employees is that specified (defined) contributions will be made during an individual&#x27;s working life.There are many ways to finance a pension and save for retirement. Pension plans can be set up by an employer, matching a monetary contribution each month, by the state or personally through a pension scheme with a financial institution, such as a bank or brokerage firm. Pension plans often come with a tax break depending on the country and plan type.

For example, Canadians have the option to open a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP), as well as a range of employee and state pension programs. This plan allows contributions to this account to be marked as un-taxable income and remain un-taxed until withdrawal. Most countries&#x27; governments will provide advice on pension schemes.

=== Financing structure ===
Social and state pensions depend largely upon legislation for their sustainability. Some have identified funds, but these hold essentially government bonds—a form of &quot;IOU&quot; by the state which may rank no higher than the state&#x27;s promise to pay future pensions.

Occupational pensions are typically provided through employment agreements between workers and employers, and their financing structure must meet legislative requirements. In common-law jurisdictions, the law requires that pensions be pre-funded in trusts, with a range of requirements to ensure the trustees act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. These jurisdictions account for over 80% of assets held by private pension plans around the world. Of the $50.7 trillion of global assets in 2019, $32.2T were in U.S. plans, the next largest being the U.K. ($3.2T), Canada ($2.8T), Australia ($1.9T), Singapore ($0.3T), Hong Kong and Ireland (each roughly $0.2T), New Zealand, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Jamaica, etc.

Civil-law jurisdictions with statutory trust vehicles for pensions include the Netherlands ($1.8T), Japan ($1.7T), Switzerland ($1.1T), Denmark ($0.8T), Sweden, Brazil and S. Korea (each $0.5T), Germany, France, Israel, P.R. China, Mexico, Italy, Chile, Belgium, Spain and Finland (each roughly $0.2T), etc. Without the vast body of common law to draw upon, statutory trusts tend to be more uniform and tightly regulated.

However, pension assets alone are not a useful guide to the total distribution of occupational pensions around the world. It will be noted that four of the largest economies (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) have very little in the way of pension assets. Nevertheless, in terms of typical net income replacement in retirement, these countries rank well relative to those with pension assets. These and other countries represent a fundamentally different approach to pension provision, often referred to as &quot;intergenerational solidarity&quot;.

Intergenerational solidarity operates to an extent in any country with a defined-benefit social security system, but is more controversial when applied to high levels of professional income. Why should younger generations pay for executive pensions which they themselves are unsure of collecting?  Employers have sought ways of getting round this problem through pre-funding, but in civil-law countries have often been limited by the legal vehicles available. A suitable legal vehicle should ideally have three qualities. First, it should convince employees that the assets are truly secured for their benefit. Second, contributions to the vehicle should be tax-deductible to the employer (or at least, a tax deduction should be secured already). And third, to the extent that it has funded the pension liability, the employer should be able to reduce the liability shown on its balance sheet.

In the absence of appropriate statute, attempts have been made to invent suitable vehicles with varying degrees of success. The most notable has been in Germany where, until the end of the 20th century, most occupational pensions were unfunded (&quot;book-reserved&quot;) promises by employers. Changes started in 1983.

===Unfunded or Pay-as-you-go===

In an &quot;unfunded&quot; defined benefit pension, no assets are set aside and the benefits are paid for by the employer or other pension sponsor as and when they are paid. Pension arrangements provided by the state in most countries in the world are unfunded, with benefits paid directly from current workers&#x27; contributions and taxes. This method of financing is known as pay-as-you-go, or PAYGO. The social security systems of many European countries are unfunded, having benefits paid directly out of current taxes and social security contributions, although several countries have hybrid systems which are partially funded. Spain set up the Social Security Reserve Fund and France set up the Pensions Reserve Fund; in Canada the wage-based retirement plan (CPP) is partially funded, with assets managed by the CPP Investment Board while the U.S. Social Security system is partially funded by investment in special U.S. Treasury Bonds.

==== Dependency ratio ====
A growing challenge for pay-as-you-go pensions is the dependency ratio. As birth rates drop and life expectancy increases an ever-larger portion of the population is elderly. This leaves fewer workers for each retired person. In many developed countries this means that government and public sector pensions could potentially be a drag on their economies unless pension systems are reformed or taxes are increased. One method of reforming the pension system is to increase the retirement age. Two exceptions are Australia and Canada, where the pension system is forecast to be solvent for the foreseeable future. In Canada, for instance, the annual payments were increased by some 70% in 1998 to achieve this. These two nations also have an advantage from their relative openness to immigration: immigrants tend to be of working age. However, their populations are not growing as fast as the U.S., which supplements a high immigration rate with one of the highest birthrates among Western countries. Thus, the population in the U.S. is not ageing to the extent as those in Europe, Australia, or Canada.

=== Underfunding ===
Another growing challenge is the recent trend of states and businesses in the United States purposely under-funding their pension schemes in order to push the costs onto the federal government. For example, in 2009, the majority of states have unfunded pension liabilities exceeding all reported state debt. Bradley Belt, former executive director of the PBGC (the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency that insures private-sector defined-benefit pension plans in the event of bankruptcy), testified before a Congressional hearing in October 2004, &quot;I am particularly concerned with the temptation, and indeed, growing tendency, to use the pension insurance fund as a means to obtain an interest-free and risk-free loan to enable companies to restructure. Unfortunately, the current calculation appears to be that shifting pension liabilities onto other premium payers or potentially taxpayers is the path of least resistance rather than a last resort.&quot; Challenges have further been increased by the post-2007 credit crunch. Total funding of the nation&#x27;s 100 largest corporate pension plans fell by $303bn in 2008, going from a $86bn surplus at the end of 2007 to a $217bn deficit at the end of 2008. 

==== Economic challenges ====
Economic uncertainty can also be a cause for worry in the near future. As of April 2023, the global economy has been volatile in recent years, and this can have a significant impact on pension plans. For example, low interest rates can make it more difficult for pension funds to generate returns on their investments, which can in turn lead to lower benefits for pensioners. In addition, economic downturns can lead to higher unemployment rates, which can result in lower contributions to pension plans. This recent period of economic uncertainty has seen a rise in self-employed workers. As such, the rise of gig economy and the increasing number of workers who are self-employed has made it more challenging to provide retirement benefits to a growing segment of the workforce due to the fact that many of these workers do not have access to employer-sponsored pension plans, making it more difficult for them to save for retirement.

====Pension crisis====

===Funded===

In a &quot;funded&quot; plan, contributions from the employer, and sometimes also from plan members, invest in a fund towards meeting the benefits. All plans must be funded in some way, even if they are pay-as-you-go, so this type of plan is more accurately known as pre-funded or fully-funded. The future returns on the investments, and the future benefits to be paid, are not known in advance, so there is no guarantee that a given level of contributions will be enough to meet the benefits. Typically, the contributions to be paid are regularly reviewed in a valuation of the plan&#x27;s assets and liabilities, carried out by an actuary to ensure that the pension fund will meet future payment obligations. This means that in a defined benefit pension, investment risk and investment rewards are typically assumed by the sponsor/employer and not by the individual. If a plan is not well-funded, the plan sponsor may not have the financial resources to continue funding the plan.

=== Gender pension gap ===
The inequality between men and women in terms of pensions is a significant issue all around the world. As per a 2015 report by the European Commission the average pension gender gap in the EU28 was 40.2% in 2014. This means that men aged 65–74 on average receive pensions that are 40.2% higher than those of women in the same age group. This gap is much larger than the gender pay gap (16.1%) and the annual earnings gender gap (23.0%) in 2014 and 2010, respectively. The countries with the highest pension gender gaps are Cyprus, Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria, and 14 EU member states have a pension gender gap of at least 30%. However, Eastern European countries have a smaller pension gender gap due to less pronounced gender differences in part-time work usage. In OECD countries, women aged 65 and over receive around 74% of men&#x27;s retirement income from both public and private pension sources. The gender pension gap in OECD countries varies from 3% in Estonia to 47% in Japan. Despite some progress in some countries over the years, the gender pension gap remains a major issue in many nations.

As for the possible causes of the pension gender gap phenomenon, it is likely that women are more affected due to gender segregation in the labour market and the unequal division of care roles in households. In addition, women tend to be more dependent on basic pensions, which makes them more vulnerable to reductions in these kind of pensions in favour of occupational ones. Moreover, the fact that many current pension systems require a minimum of 40 years of work to build up occupational pensions or penalise part-time employment, together with the limited care services many of them offer for babies, means that women, because of the need to interrupt their working lives for maternity, are at a disadvantage compared to men when it comes to collecting pensions; which is aggravated by the fact that occupational pensions are gaining more and more weight compared to basic pensions in the current structure. Lower employment rates and the gender pay gap, due to lower wages and career breaks, are also factors contributing to the gender pension gap. Furthermore, individual and occupational pensions are often based on actuarial equity, which penalises women with gender-differentiated rates. There is a gender gap in expected years in retirement with 22.8 years for women and 18.4 years for men on average (OECD, 2022), see also sex differences in life expectancy. Finally, cultural and behavioural factors, such as lack of access to education and gender expectations, can also contribute to the gender pay gap and the gender pension gap.

=== Balancing pension funding ===
Different economic policies are the adjusted to balance the funding of pensions:

* Decrease of real pensions, 
* Increase of employee social contribution, 
* Increase of employer social contribution, 
* Increase of the retirement age.

These channels have been used by many governments to implement new retirement pension reforms. In the past, they had been sometimes simultaneously used (two or three channels used in the same time for a pension reform) or with a targeted way (on a certain group of persons such as in a certain business sector).

Retirement pensions turn out to be considerable amounts of money. For instance, in France, it is about 300 billion euros each year, namely 14-15% of French GDP. It is therefore very interesting and informative to illustrate the impacts of these different channels to finance the retirement pension, especially nowadays since many riots take place in different countries against new retirement pension reforms or willing to change the national retirement pension process.

Simulating these economic policies is then useful to understand every mechanism linked to these channels. Four different channels to finance retirement pensions will be simulated successively and will allow to explain their impacts on main economic variables presented below with an eight-year horizon. Some software of macroeconomic simulation allows to compute and display them. The implementation of these economic shocks and their mechanisms will be analysed in the following sections.

==== Decrease of real pensions ====
This economic shock is to permanently decrease the amount of real pensions paid to retirees by for example 1 GDP point. Transfers from public power to households are therefore dropped by 1 GDP point. In the case of France (given 14–15% of GDP corresponds to retirement pensions), this is a drop of 7.5% of mass pension benefits.

It proves to be demand shock insofar as the household&#x27;s available income decreases in the short term. This drop of purchasing power implies a diminishment of consumption and of demand in general. The activity is then negatively affected. However, the current account is improved as imports decrease following the reduce of domestic demand. In the medium term, since this cut of consumption and demand, unemployment increases. The price index decreases as the consumption price drops. As a consequence, exports increase. The real labour cost falls increasing thus companies&#x27; margins which limits the degradation of investments. The drop of consumption remains higher than the increase of current account which thereby results in the decrease of GDP. The public finance balance increases following the diminishment of pension benefits spent to retirees. However, unemployment benefits increase and given the drop of consumption and of household&#x27;s incomes, which implies a fall in the incomes received from income tax and VAT by public administration.

==== Increase of employee social contribution ====
This economic shock involves the permanent increase of employee social contribution by for instance 2 points. This social contribution is spent by household as a share of mass wages received by them.

It turns out to be a demand shock because household&#x27;s disposable income decreases from the short term. Indeed, the income perceived by employees is reduced following the increase of employee social contribution. As the previous channel, the drop of purchasing power result in a diminishment of consumption and demand in general. It implies a drop in activity. However, the current account is improved as imports are reduced following the cut of interior demand. In the medium term, the implications are similar to the decrease of real pensions. Employment and the price index decrease. Exports increase and the drop of investments is limited. The GDP decreases too. Finally, in the short term, the public finance balance increases but is quickly limited (but remains an increase) with the decrease of revenues from VAT and income taxes and the increase of unemployment.

==== Increase of employer social contribution ====
This economic shock is to permanently increase employer social contribution by for instance 2 points. This social contribution is spent by employer as a share of mass wages paid to each employee.

It proves to be a supply economic shock. Indeed, the rise of the labour cost degrades the labour demand and increases the costs of production. The competitivity is degraded and results in the drop of the purchasing power. Job losses are then attended: the unemployment strongly increases. This shock is also inflationary given that household&#x27;s consumption prices rise. As corporations&#x27; profitability drops, exports and companies&#x27; investment fall too. The current account drops and this shock is not expansionist: the GDP decreases. Finally, the public finance balance is improved but less than planned. Indeed, employer social contribution is increased but it happens to be less than expected as unemployment rises. In addition, income tax is lower than before the shock, employee social contribution increases and unemployment benefits expenses increase.

==== Increase of the retirement age ====
This economic shock involves an increase of the retirement age. To do so, it implies a permanent increase in the working age of for instance 2% and to decrease the number of retirees of an equivalent amount. For this last step, it is tantamount to decrease global real pensions by a certain number of GDP point. In order to find this precise number for the simulation, we can assume people live on average 80 years, study during 20 years and are retirees during 20 years. As a consequence, an increase of 2% for life expectancy at work amounts to a decrease of 4% for life expectancy in retirement. Real pensions make globally a certain percentage of the GDP according to the country chosen. By knowing it, you can finally find the certain number of GDP point to simulate the decrease of number of retirees. For instance, in France real pensions make globally around 15% of GDP. Finally, -4% of 15% makes a decrease of 0.6 of GDP point.

In the short term, this labour force shock (supply policy) leads to an increase of unemployment which negatively affects household&#x27;s purchasing power. The consumption decreases along with demand in general which leads to a decrease of activity. However, the current account is improved as imports are reduced with the drop of domestic demand. In the medium term, through the rise of unemployment, gross salary and the real labour cost progressively decreases. It results in the progressive increase of employment and thus the gradual decrease of unemployment. The household&#x27;s consumption prices decrease: this shock is deflationary. The competitivity is improved which lead to a job creation and the boost of economic activity. The GDP increases and this shock is therefore expansionist. Administration&#x27;s financing capacity improved in the short term happens to be limited in the medium term. Indeed, the drop of prices decreases the tax bases, especially household income. 

High old-age dependency ratios lead to forecasts of retirement ages of up to 70 years.

==Pillars==
Most national pension systems are based on multi-pillar schemes to ensure greater flexibility and financial security to the old in contrast to reliance on one single system. In general, there are three main functions of pension systems: saving, redistribution and insurance functions. According to the report by the World Bank titled &quot;Averting the Old Age Crisis&quot;, countries should consider separating the saving and redistributive functions, when creating pension systems, and placing them under different financing and managerial arrangements into three main pillars.

The Pillars of Old Age Income Security:
However, this typology is rather a prescriptive than a descriptive one and most specialists usually allocate all public programmes to the first pillar, including earnings-related public schemes, which does not fit the original definition of the first pillar.

===Zero pillar===
This non-contributory pillar was introduced only recently, aiming to alleviate poverty among the elderly, and permitting fiscal conditions. It is usually financed by the state and is in form of basic pension schemes or social assistance. In some typologies, the zero and the first pillar overlap.

===First pillar===
Pillar 1, sometimes referred to as &quot;the public pillar&quot; or &quot;first-tier&quot;, answers the aim to prevent the poverty of the elderly, provide some absolute, minimum income based on solidarity and replace some portion of lifetime pre-retirement income. It is financed on a redistributive principle without constructing large reserves and takes the form of mandatory contributions linked to earnings such as minimum pensions within earnings-related plans, or separate targeted programs for retirement income. These are provided by the public sector and typically financed on pay-as-you-go basis.

===Second pillar===
Pillar 2, or &quot;the second tier,&quot; built on the basis of defined benefit and defined contribution plans with independent investment management, aims to protect the elderly from relative poverty and provides benefits supplementary to the income from the first pillar to contributors. Therefore, the second pillar fulfils the insurance function. In addition to DB&#x27;s and DC&#x27;s, other types of pension schemes of the second pillar are &quot;the contingent accounts&quot;, known also as Notional Defined Contributions (implemented for example in Italy, Latvia, Poland and Sweden) or &quot;occupational pension schemes&quot; (applied, for instance, in Estonia, Germany and Norway).

===Third pillar===
The third tier consists of voluntary contributions in various different forms, including occupational or private saving plans, and products for individuals.

===Fourth Pillar===
The fourth pillar is usually excluded from classifications since it does not usually have a legal basis and consists of &quot;informal support (such as family), other formal social programs (such as health care or housing), and other individual assets (such as home ownership and reverse mortgages).&quot;

These five pillars and their main criteria are summarised in the table below by Holzmann and Hinz.

Multipillar Pension Taxonomy: 
== Pension systems by country ==

==History==

In the classical world, Romans offered veteran legionnaires (centurions) military pensions, typically in the form of a land grant or a special, often semi-public, appointment. Augustus Caesar (63 BC–AD 14) introduced one of the first recognisable pension schemes in history with his military treasury. In 13 BC Augustus created a pension plan in which retired soldiers were to receive a pension (of minimum 3,000 denarii in a lump sum, which at the time represented around 13 times a legionnaires&#x27; annual salary) after 16 years of service in a legion and four years in the military reserves. The retiring soldiers were in the beginning paid from general revenues and later from a special fund (&quot;aeririum militare&quot;) established by Augustus in 5 or 6 AD. This was in an attempt to quell a rebellion within the Roman Empire which was facing militaristic turmoil at the time.

Widows&#x27; funds were among the first pension type arrangement to appear. For example, Duke Ernest the Pious of Gotha in Germany founded a widows&#x27; fund for clergy in 1645 and another for teachers in 1662. &quot;Various schemes of provision for ministers&#x27; widows were then established throughout Europe at about the start of the eighteenth century, some based on a single premium others based on yearly premiums to be distributed as benefits in the same year.&quot;

Modern forms of pension systems were first introduced in the late 19th century. Germany was the first country to introduce a universal pension program for employees.

=== Germany ===
As part of Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s social legislation, the Old Age and Disability Insurance Bill was enacted and implemented in 1889. The Old Age Pension program, financed by a tax on workers, was originally designed to provide a pension annuity for workers who reached the age of 70 years, though this was lowered to 65 years in 1916. Unlike accident insurance and health insurance, this program covered industrial, agrarian, artisans and servants from the start and was supervised directly by the state.

Germany&#x27;s mandatory state pension provisions are based on the pay-as-you-go (or redistributive) model. Funds paid in by contributors (employees and employers) are not saved and neither invested but are used to pay current pension obligations.

===Ireland===

There is a history of pensions in Ireland that can be traced back to Brehon Law imposing a legal responsibility on the kin group to take care of its members who were aged, blind, deaf, sick or insane. For a discussion on pension funds and early Irish law, see F Kelly, &quot;A Guide to Early Irish Law&quot; (Dublin, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1988). In 2010, there were over 76,291 pension schemes operating in Ireland.

In January 2018, a &quot;total contributions approach&quot; qualification system was announced, effective from March 2018, for those pensioners who reached state pension age after 1 September 2012. The new system requires a person to have 40 years&#x27; worth or contributions to receive the full rate and a minimum total period of paid contributions of 520 weeks with ten years&#x27; full coverage. The State Pension is payable from age 66 with the age being increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.

=== Spain ===
The history of pensions in Spain began in 1908 with the creation of the National Insurance Institute (INP) and the design of old-age pensions in a free affiliation scheme subsidised by the State. Although in 1919 the pension system was made compulsory and in 1931 an attempt was made to unify the different branches of insurance, the INP failed to ensure that pensions acted as immediate remedial measures for the old-age problem that was evident at the time. Public intervention in social insurance in Spain during these years was greatly determined by the failure of private initiatives such as the Savings and Pension Fund of Barcelona.

The Mandatory Workers&#x27; Retirement (ROO) was the first compulsory social insurance in Spain and was aimed at wage earners between the ages of 16 and 65 who earned no more than 4,000 pesetas a year. This was followed by the creation of the Social Security system in 1963, early retirement and the possibility of partial retirement in 1978 and the special regime for self-employed workers in 1985.

Various reforms and adjustments have been made over time, such as the 1995 reform that established the sustainability factor and the 2011 reform that raised the retirement age from 65 to 67. Currently, the pension system in Spain is still under debate to ensure its long-term sustainability with proposals such as the implementation of private pension plans and the revision of the conditions of access to public pensions.

===United Kingdom===

The decline of Feudal systems and formation of national states throughout Europe led to the reemergence of standing armies with their allegiances to states. Consequently, the sixteenth century in England marked the establishment of standardised systems of military pensions. During its 1592–93 session, Parliament established disability payments or &quot;reliefe for Souldiours ... [who] adventured their lives and lost their limbs or disabled their bodies&quot; in the service of the Crown. This pension was again generous by contemporary standards, even though annual pensions were not to exceed ten pounds for &quot;private soldiers&quot;, or twenty pounds for a &quot;lieutenant&quot;.
The beginning of the modern state pension came with the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, that provided 5 shillings (£0.25) a week for those over 70 whose annual means do not exceed £31.50. It coincided with the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09 and was the first step in the Liberal welfare reforms to the completion of a system of social security, with unemployment and health insurance through the National Insurance Act 1911.

In 1921, The Finance Act introduced tax relief on pension contributions in line with savings and life insurance. As a consequence, the overall size of the fund was increased since the income tax was now added to the pension as well.

Then in 1978, The State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) replaced The Graduated Pension Scheme from 1959, providing a pension related to earnings, in addition to the basic state pension. Employees and employers had the possibility to contribute to it between 6 April 1978 and 5 April 2002, when it was replaced by the State Second Pension.

After the Second World War, the National Insurance Act 1946 completed universal coverage of social security, introducing a State Pension for everybody on a contributory basis, with men being eligible at 65 and women at 60. The National Assistance Act 1948 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6. c. 29) formally abolished the poor law, and gave a minimum income to those not paying National Insurance.

The early-1990s established the existing framework for state pensions in the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and Superannuation and other Funds (Validation) Act 1992. Following the highly respected Goode Report, occupational pensions were covered by comprehensive statutes in the Pension Schemes Act 1993 and the Pensions Act 1995.

In 2002, the Pensions Commission was established as a cross-party body to review pensions in the United Kingdom. The first Act to follow was the Pensions Act 2004 that updated regulation by replacing OPRA with the Pensions Regulator and relaxing the stringency of minimum funding requirements for pensions while ensuring protection for insolvent businesses. In a major update of the state pension, the Pensions Act 2007, which aligned and raised retirement ages. Following that, the Pensions Act 2008 has set up automatic enrolment for occupational pensions, and a public competitor designed to be a low-cost and efficient fund manager, called the National Employment Savings Trust (or &quot;Nest&quot;).

===United States===
The first &quot;American&quot; pensions came in 1636, when Plymouth colony, and subsequently, other colonies such as Virginia, Maryland (1670s) and NY (1690s), offered the first colonial pension. The general assembly of the Virginia Company followed by approving a resolution known as Virginia Act IX of 1644 stating that &quot;...all hurt or maymed men be relieved and provided for by the several counties, where such men reside or inhabit.&quot; Furthermore, during King Philip&#x27;s War, otherwise known as the First Indian War, this Act was expanded to widows and orphans in Virginia&#x27;s Act of 1675.

Public pensions got their start with various &#x27;promises&#x27;, informal and legislated, made to veterans of the Revolutionary War and, more extensively, the Civil War. They were expanded greatly, and began to be offered by a number of state and local governments during the early Progressive Era in the late nineteenth century.

Federal civilian pensions were offered under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), formed in 1920. CSRS provided retirement, disability and survivor benefits for most civilian employees in the U.S. Federal government, until the creation of a new Federal agency, the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), in 1987.

Pension plans became popular in the United States during World War II, when wage freezes prohibited outright increases in workers&#x27; pay. The defined benefit plan had been the most popular and common type of retirement plan in the United States through the 1980s; since that time, defined contribution plans have become the more common type of retirement plan in the United States and many other western countries.

In April 2012, the Northern Mariana Islands Retirement Fund filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The retirement fund is a defined benefit type pension plan and was only partially funded by the government, with only $268.4 million in assets and $911 million in liabilities. The plan experienced low investment returns and a benefit structure that had been increased without raises in funding.
According to &quot;Pensions and Investments&quot;, this is &quot;apparently the first&quot; U.S. public pension plan to declare bankruptcy.

<text>A pension fund, also known as a superannuation fund in some countries, is any program, fund, or scheme which provides retirement income. The U.S. Government&#x27;s Social Security Trust Fund, which oversees $2.57 trillion in assets, is the world&#x27;s largest public pension fund. Pension funds typically have large amounts of money to invest and are the major investors in listed and private companies. They are especially important to the stock market where large institutional investors dominate. The largest 300 pension funds collectively hold about USD$6 trillion in assets. In 2012, PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that pension funds worldwide hold over $33.9 trillion in assets (and were expected to grow to more than $56 trillion by 2020), the largest for any category of institutional investor ahead of mutual funds, insurance companies, currency reserves, sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, or private equity.

==Classifications==
===Open vs. closed pension fund===
Open pension funds support at least one pension plan with no restriction on membership while closed pension funds support only pension plans that are limited to certain employees. Closed pension funds are further subclassified into:
*Single employer pension funds
*Multi-employer pension funds
*Related member pension funds
*Individual pension funds

===Public vs. private pension funds===
A public pension fund is one that is regulated under public sector law while a private pension fund is regulated under private sector law. In certain countries, the distinction between public or government pension funds and private pension funds may be difficult to assess. In others, the distinction is made sharply in law, with very specific requirements for administration and investment. For example, local governmental bodies in the United States are subject to laws passed by the states in which those localities exist, and these laws include provisions such as defining classes of permitted investments and a minimum municipal obligation.

==How they work ==
It is important to distinguish between pension plan, funds and firm. A pension plan is a benefits program set up and sustained by an employer or an employee group. They are managed by state or private firms as well as pension funds. Pension funds are financial mechanisms that provide retirement income for employees after their working life. They work by accumulating contributions from employers, and sometimes employees, which are then invested to grow over time. Upon retirement, employees receive benefits, typically calculated as a percentage of their average salary during their working years. For instance, consider a scenario where a pension scheme offers a payment equivalent to 1% of an individual&#x27;s average salary over the last five years of their employment for each year they served with the employer. Thus, if an employee worked for 35 years at the company and had an average final salary of $60,000, they would be entitled to an annual pension of $21,000. It is important to point out that one cannot usually take early withdraws or loan from pension. Public sector pensions, like the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), often include cost-of-living escalator and can be more generous than private sector pensions. Private pension plans are regulated by federal laws such as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which guarantees benefits if a pension plan fails.

== How pension funds invest their money ==
Pension funds can make investments into stocks, bond, real estate, and other assets. However, they have to be prudently managed compared to other types of funds due to their lower risk tolerance. For many years, they mainly invest into stable stocks and bond. In order to keep a high returns, with changing market conditions, they started to invest into other assets. As of 2023, many pension funds are moving away from managing active stock portfolios towards passive investment methods, focusing on index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that replicate market indices. Additionally, there&#x27;s an increasing trend to diversify into alternative assets like commodities, high-yield bonds, hedge funds, and real estate. Newer investment tools for pension funds include asset-backed securities, such as those tied to student loans or credit card debt, which are used to boost returns. Investing to Private equity is also rising in popularity; these are long-term investments in non-public companies, aimed at achieving substantial profits through eventual sales when these companies reach maturity. Furthermore, real estate investment trusts (REITs) are becoming a frequent choice for pension funds due to their passive investment approach in the real estate sector. Direct investments in commercial properties like office buildings, warehouses, and industrial parks are also prevalent.

Many governments around the world have established public pension systems that are partially or fully funded by investments rather than relying solely on payroll taxes. This approach helps ensure the long-term solvency of these pension programs. Some examples of governments that use pension fund investments are:

* Norway: The Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global, also known as the Oil Fund, is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. It invests the surplus revenues from Norway&#x27;s oil and gas industry to help finance the country&#x27;s public pension system and other government expenses.
* Singapore: The Central Provident Fund (CPF) in Singapore is a compulsory social security savings plan that requires contributions from both employers and employees. The CPF board invests these funds to generate returns and ensure the long-term financial stability of the pension system.
* Canada: The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) manages the investment of the Canada Pension Plan&#x27;s assets. It invests in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets to generate returns and secure the future of the public pension system.
* Australia: The Australian Government&#x27;s Future Fund was established in 2006 to help cover the government&#x27;s superannuation (pension) liabilities. It invests in a range of asset classes, including equities, fixed income, and alternative investments, to grow the fund&#x27;s assets over time.
* Sweden: The Swedish Pension System (Allmänna pensionssystemet) has a buffer fund, the AP Funds, that invests in various financial instruments to supplement the pay-as-you-go pension contributions and ensure the system&#x27;s long-term sustainability.

These are just a few examples of governments that have adopted an investment-based approach to managing their public pension systems. By diversifying and growing their pension fund assets, these countries aim to mitigate the risks of running out of money in the future as their populations age.

== Governance ==
Pension funds are important financial institutions which are managing the retirement savings of millions. Effective governance in these entities is crucial not only to safeguard these funds but also to ensure they meet their future obligations to pensioners. The governance structures, strategies, and practices of pension funds significantly influence their stability, performance, and the trust of their stakeholders. Proper governance ensures that decisions are made transparently and that fund managers are accountable to stakeholders, including employees, retirees, and employers.

According to the OECD Guidelines for Pension Fund Governance, the governance structure should clearly identify and separate operational and oversight responsibilities. Every pension fund should have a governing body, accountable to the pension plan members and beneficiaries. This body is ultimately responsible for ensuring adherence to the terms of the arrangement and the protection of the best interest of plan members and beneficiaries. The governing body should also meet minimum suitability standards to ensure a high level of integrity, competence, experience, and professionalism. Additionally, there should be adequate internal controls in place to ensure compliance with the law.

== Challenges ==
Many pension funds have problem with governance. In Hungary, where pension funds are established as not-for-profit institutions, there is evidence that the governing body is generally ineffective in looking after the best interest of members. Most funds are established by financial institutions that find it easy to promote their candidates to the fund&#x27;s supervisory board. Some pension funds in the United States have also been the subject of governance problems too, as well as in other countries.

== History of pension funds ==
The first concepts of providing retirement benefits have roots in ancient civilizations such as Rome and Greece. The pension system as we know it originated in the 19th century. In 1889, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck started an early modern pension scheme. His goal was to help older German´s citizens. However, this idea came from the United States of America. In 1875 American Express Company introduced its own pension plan. During the early 20th century pension plans for public employees were growing, which resulted in creating a U.S. federal retirement plan, known as Social Security, in 1935. After World War II, pension funds became the primary tool for providing retirement benefits, which was supported by the growth of labour unions. By the 1970s, they held large amounts of financial assets and had evolved to be significant participants in financial markets. But in the 1980s and 1990s pension funds faced significant challenges. The stock market crash in 1987 and the recession in the early 1990s had a negative impact on pension funds. Furthermore, demographic shifts and rising life expectancies placed pressure on these funds to sustain retirement benefits over extended durations.

== Regulation ==
In the United States, pension plans are regulated mainly by The Employee Retirement Income Security Act 1974(ERISA). It provides framework for the regulation of employee pension and plans which are private pension funds offering. In 2006 was introduced The Pension Protection Act (PPA). This act come with new funding requirements for defined pension plans. As well as with new rules for calculating plan assets and liabilities.

Pension funds in European Union are regulated by Directive 2003/41/EC , also known as the IORP directive. This directive was recast and adopted in December 2016. It should promote long-term investment via occupational pension funds. Additionally, beneficiaries and members should now be better informed about their entitlements, address challenges faced by occupational pension funds operating across borders, and foster long-term investments in economic activities that boost growth, enhance the environment, and increase employment opportunities.

====Penzijní připojištění (Pension Plan, PP)====
* Pension Plan could be negotiated until the end of 2012. These funds are called &quot;Transformed Funds&quot; (TF). These carry a guarantee of non-negative appreciation in each year of saving. Therefore, their investment strategy is also conservative and based on investing in bonds and money market instruments. The fund credits appreciation only once a year.
* The client does not hold any unit certificates or pension units, but, on the basis of the funds invested, state contributions and, where appropriate, employer contributions, holds a share in the fund&#x27;s assets, which appreciate in value over time and are completely separate from the pension company.

* Supplementary Pension Savings have been available since the beginning of 2013. They operate on a similar principle to unit trusts, except that they are set up by pension companies and the client receives pension units instead of unit certificates.
*The main difference from the client&#x27;s point of view is the possibility to choose the investment strategy of their savings. The three main strategies are:
** Conservative funds – a strategy suitable for clients who wish to invest safely in money market instruments.
**Balanced (mixed) funds – a strategy suitable for clients who wish to take advantage of investing in government bonds and stocks within a single fund.
**Dynamic funds – a strategy suitable for clients who wish to invest exclusively in stocks and expect high returns that beat inflation. In this case, a high risk of volatility must be taken into account. This risk can be mitigated by regular savings.

====Dlouhodobý investiční produkt (Long-term Investment Product, DIP)====
*As of 1 January 2024, a long-term investment product was launched, thanks to which it is possible to invest in shares, bonds or investment funds.

<doc id="43616" wikidata="Q40234" url="?curid=43616" title="Arsinoe II">
<text>Arsinoë II (, 316 BC – between 270 and 268 BC) was Queen consort of Thrace, Anatolia, and Macedonia by her first and second marriage, to king Lysimachus and king Ptolemy Keraunos respectively, and then Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt by marriage to her brother, Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus. As an Egyptian queen she acquired the royal name Arsinoe Philadelphos, as well the title translated as &quot;King of Upper and Lower Egypt&quot; that may suggest she was co-ruler with her husband; the exact meaning of this elevation and whether it occurred during her life or posthumously is uncertain. After her death, Arsinoe was deified at the orders of her husband and the cult of Arsinoe Philadelphos became widespread in the Ptolemaic territories.

==Life==
===Early life===
Arsinoë was the first daughter of Pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter, founder of the Hellenistic state of Egypt, and his second wife Berenice I of Egypt.

She was maybe born in Memphis, but was raised in the new city of Alexandria, where her father moved his capital. Nothing is known of her childhood or education, but judging from her later life as patron of scholars and noted for her learning, she is estimated to have been given a high education. Her brothers were tutored by intellectuals hired by their fathers, and it is regarded likely that she attended these lessons as well: she corresponded with the intellectual Strato of Lampsacus later in life, and he may have previously been her tutor.

===Queen of Lysimachus===
Around the age of 15, Arsinoë married King Lysimachus, who was then around 60 years old. Together, the pair had three sons: Ptolemy Epigonos, Lysimachus, and Philip.

In order to position her sons for the throne, she had Lysimachus&#x27; first son, Agathocles, poisoned on account of treason.

Arsinoe reportedly paid for a rotunda in the Samothrace temple complex, where she was likely an initiate. 

===Queen of Ptolemy Keraunos===
In 281 BC, Lysimachus died in battle and Arsinoë fled to Cassandreia (). There, she married her paternal half-brother Ptolemy Keraunos. Ptolemy Keraunos was a son of Ptolemy I Soter and his first wife, Eurydice of Egypt. The marriage was for political reasons: both claimed the throne of Macedonia and Thrace (by the time of his death Lysimachus was ruler of both regions, and his power extended to southern Greece and Anatolia). Their relationship was never good.

As Ptolemy Keraunos was becoming more powerful, Arsinoë decided it was time to stop him and conspired against him with her sons. This action caused Ptolemy Keraunus to kill two of her sons, Lysimachus and Philip, while the eldest, Ptolemy, was able to escape and to flee north, to the kingdom of the Dardanians.

Arsinoë sought refuge in the Samothrace temple complex, which she had benefited during her tenure as queen. She eventually left from Samothrace for Alexandria, Egypt, to seek protection from her brother, Ptolemy II Philadelphus.

It is not known which year she left for Egypt. She may have left as early as 280/279 BC, directly after the murder of the younger sons, or as late as 277/276 BC, when the claim of her eldest son to the Macedonian throne had clearly failed, following the succession of Antigonus II Gonatas.

===Queen of Egypt===

In Egypt, she is believed to have instigated the accusation and exile of Arsinoe I, the wife of her younger brother Ptolemy II. Whether this belief was correct remains unknown. It is not known which year she arrived in Egypt, nor when her sister-in-law was exiled, nor whether the divorce between her brother and Arsinoe I may have taken place without the involvement of Arsinoe II.

Whatever the case, after the divorce of Ptolemy, Arsinoe II then married her brother. As a result, both were given the epithet &quot;Philadelphoi&quot; ( &quot;Sibling-lovers&quot;). The closer circumstances and reasons behind the marriage is not known. According to R. A. Hazzard, the year of their marriage is 273 or 272 BC because of the change of the preamble in the papyri. 

Her role as queen was unprecedented in the dynasty at the time and became a role model for later Ptolemaic queens: she acted alongside her brother in ritual and public display, became a religious and literal patron, and was included in the Egyptian and Greek cults created for them by her brother. Sharing in all of her brother&#x27;s titles, she was quite influential, having towns dedicated to her, her own cult (as was Egyptian custom), appearing on coinage, and contributing to foreign policy, including Ptolemy II&#x27;s victory in the First Syrian War between Egypt and the Seleucid Empire.

According to Posidippus, she won three chariot races at the Olympic Games, probably in 272 BC.

==Deification==

She died in 270 or 268 BC and circumstantial evidence supports the latter date. After her death, Ptolemy II established a cult of Arsinoe Philadelphus. She received burial and deification rites at Mendes, where she had been a priestess. Those rites are commemorated in the Mendes stele. This stele also includes the decree of Ptolemy II announcing her cult. All temples in Egypt were required to include a cult statue of Arsinoe II alongside the main deity of the sanctuary. In the relief at the top of the stele, Arsinoe is depicted among the deities receiving sacrifice from Ptolemy - an image that recurs throughout the country. Separate temples were constructed for Arsinoe, at Memphis, and elsewhere. The Fayyum region became the Arsinoite nome, with Arsinoe as its patron goddess. From 263 BC, a portion of tax on orchard and vineyard produce in each nome of Egypt was dedicated to funding the local cult of Arsinoe.

Arsinoe&#x27;s cult was also propagated in Alexandria. An annual priesthood, known as the Canephorus of Arsinoe Philadelphus, was established by 269 BC. The holder of the office was included as part of the dating formula in all official documents until the late second century BC. An annual procession was held in Arsinoe&#x27;s honour, led by the Canephorus. Every household along the procession&#x27;s route was required to erect a small altar of sand and sacrifice birds and lentils for Arsinoe. A large temple was erected by the harbour in Alexandria. The admiral Callicrates of Samos erected another sanctuary at Cape Zephyrium, at the eastern end of the harbour, where Arsinoe was worshipped as Aphrodite Euploia (Aphrodite of the good-sailing). Similar sanctuaries were established at a number of port-cities under Ptolemaic control, including Citium in Cyprus, Delos in the Nesiotic League, and Thera. As a result of these sanctuaries, Arsinoe became closely associated with protection from shipwrecks. Coinage and statuettes depicting the divine Arsinoe survive. Her divine attributes are a small ram&#x27;s horn behind her ear - symbolising her connection to the ram of Mendes - and a pair of cornucopiae which she carries. She appears in this guise on a set of mass-produced faience Oenochoae, which seem to have been associated with funerary ritual in Alexandria.

Arsinoe seems to have been a genuinely popular goddess throughout the Ptolemaic period, with both Greeks and Egyptians, in Egypt and beyond. &#x27;Arsinoe&#x27; is one of the few Greek names to be naturalised as an Egyptian personal name in the period. Altars and dedicatory plaques in her honour are found throughout Egypt and the Aegean, while hundreds of her faience oenochoae have been found in the cemeteries of Alexandria.

==Marriage and issue==
Arsinoe married Lysimachus of Thrace in 300 or 299 BC and had three children:

After Lysimachus&#x27; death in 281 BC, Arsinoe was briefly married to her half-brother Ptolemy Ceraunus from 280 to 279 BC and then to her full-blooded, younger brother Ptolemy II of Egypt from the late 270s BC until her death. Ptolemy II&#x27;s children by his first wife Arsinoe I, including his eventual successor Ptolemy III were posthumously declared to be children of Arsinoe II in the late 260s BC.

<doc id="43617" wikidata="Q7372" url="?curid=43617" title="Shark">
<text>Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the Batoidea (rays and kin). Some sources extend the term &quot;shark&quot; as an informal category including extinct members of Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) with a shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. Shark-like chondrichthyans such as &quot;Cladoselache&quot; and &quot;Doliodus&quot; first appeared in the Devonian Period (419–359 million years), though some fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are as old as the Late Ordovician (458–444 million years ago). The earliest confirmed modern sharks (selachimorphs) are known from the Early Jurassic around , with the oldest known member being &quot;Agaleus&quot;, though records of true sharks may extend back as far as the Permian.

Sharks range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (&quot;Etmopterus perryi&quot;), a deep sea species that is only in length, to the whale shark (&quot;Rhincodon typus&quot;), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately in length. They are found in all seas and are common to depths up to . They generally do not live in freshwater, although there are a few known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river sharks, which can be found in both seawater and freshwater, and the Ganges shark, which lives only in freshwater. Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth.

Several species are apex predators, which are organisms that are at the top of their food chain. Select examples include the bull shark, tiger shark, great white shark, mako sharks, thresher sharks, and hammerhead sharks.

Sharks are caught by humans for shark meat or shark fin soup. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities. Since 1970, shark populations have been reduced by 71%, mostly from overfishing.

==Etymology==
Until the 16th century, sharks were known to mariners as &quot;sea dogs&quot;. This is still evidential in several species termed &quot;dogfish&quot;, or the porbeagle.

The etymology of the word &quot;shark&quot; is uncertain. The most likely etymology states that the original sense of the word was that of &quot;predator, one who preys on others&quot; from the Dutch , meaning &#x27;villain, scoundrel&#x27; (cf. &quot;card shark&quot;, &quot;loan shark&quot;, etc.), which was later applied to the fish due to its predatory behaviour.

A now disproven theory is that it derives from the Yucatec Maya word (), meaning &#x27;shark&#x27;. 
Evidence for this etymology came from the Oxford English Dictionary, which notes that &quot;shark&quot; first came into use after Sir John Hawkins&#x27; sailors exhibited one in London in 1569 and posted &quot;sharke&quot; to refer to the large sharks of the Caribbean Sea. However, the Middle English Dictionary records an isolated occurrence of the word &quot;shark&quot; (referring to a sea fish) in a letter written by Thomas Beckington in 1442, which rules out a New World etymology.

==Evolutionary history==
=== Fossil record ===

The oldest total-group chondrichthyans, known as acanthodians or &quot;spiny sharks&quot;, appeared during the Early Silurian, around 439 million years ago.&quot;&quot; The oldest confirmed members of Elasmobranchii &quot;sensu lato&quot; (the group containing all cartilaginous fish more closely related to modern sharks and rays than to chimaeras) appeared during the Devonian. Anachronistidae, the oldest probable representatives of Neoselachii, the group containing modern sharks (Selachimorpha) and rays (Batoidea) to the exclusion of most extinct elasmobranch groups, date to the Carboniferous. Selachiimorpha and Batoidea are suggested by some to have diverged during the Triassic. Fossils of the earliest true sharks may have appeared during the Permian, based on remains of &quot;synechodontiforms&quot; found in the Early Permian of Russia, but if remains of &quot;synechodontiformes&quot; from the Permian and Triassic are true sharks, they only had low diversity. Modern shark orders first appeared during the Early Jurassic, and during the Jurassic true sharks underwent great diversification. Selachimorphs largely replaced the hybodonts, which had previously been a dominant group of shark-like fish during the Triassic and Early Jurassic.

=== Taxonomy ===
Sharks belong to the clade Selachimorpha in the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The Elasmobranchii also include rays and skates; the Chondrichthyes also include Chimaeras. It was thought that the sharks form a polyphyletic group: some sharks are more closely related to rays than they are to some other sharks, but current molecular studies support monophyly of both groups of sharks and batoids.

The clade Selachimorpha is divided into the superorders Galea (or Galeomorphii), and Squalea (or Squalomorphii). The Galeans are the Heterodontiformes, Orectolobiformes, Lamniformes, and Carcharhiniformes. Lamnoids and Carcharhinoids are usually placed in one clade, but recent studies show that Lamnoids and Orectoloboids are a clade. Some scientists now think that Heterodontoids may be Squalean. The Squaleans are divided into Hexanchiformes and Squalomorpha. The former includes cow shark and frilled shark, though some authors propose that both families be moved to separate orders. The Squalomorpha contains the Squaliformes and the Hypnosqualea. The Hypnosqualea may be invalid. It includes the Squatiniformes, and the Pristorajea, which may also be invalid, but includes the Pristiophoriformes and the Batoidea.

There are more than 500 species of sharks split across thirteen orders, including several orders of sharks that have gone extinct:

*Carcharhiniformes: Commonly known as ground sharks, the order includes the blue, tiger, bull, grey reef, blacktip reef, Caribbean reef, blacktail reef, whitetip reef, and oceanic whitetip sharks (collectively called the requiem sharks) along with the houndsharks, catsharks, and hammerhead sharks. They are distinguished by an elongated snout and a nictitating membrane which protects the eyes during an attack.
*Heterodontiformes: They are generally referred to as the bullhead or horn sharks.
*Hexanchiformes: Examples from this group include the cow sharks and frilled sharks, which somewhat resembles a marine snake.
*Lamniformes: They are commonly known as the mackerel sharks. They include the goblin shark, basking shark, megamouth shark, the thresher sharks, shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and great white shark. They are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction. The Lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon, &quot;Otodus megalodon&quot;.
*Orectolobiformes: They are commonly referred to as the carpet sharks, including zebra sharks, nurse sharks, wobbegongs, and the whale shark.
*Pristiophoriformes: These are the sawsharks, with an elongated, toothed snout that they use for slashing their prey.
*Squaliformes: This group includes the dogfish sharks and roughsharks.
*Squatiniformes: Also known as angel sharks, they are flattened sharks with a strong resemblance to stingrays and skates.
*Echinorhiniformes: This group includes the prickly shark and bramble shark. Phylogenetic placement of this group has been ambiguous in scientific studies. They are sometimes given their own order, Echinorhiniformes.

==Anatomy==

===Teeth===

Shark teeth are embedded in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.

Tooth shape depends on the shark&#x27;s diet: those that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.

===Skeleton===
Shark skeletons are very different from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton&#x27;s weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.

===Jaw===
The jaws of sharks, like those of rays and skates, are not attached to the cranium. The jaw&#x27;s surface (in comparison to the shark&#x27;s vertebrae and gill arches) needs extra support due to its heavy exposure to physical stress and its need for strength. It has a layer of tiny hexagonal plates called &quot;tesserae&quot;, which are crystal blocks of calcium salts arranged as a mosaic. This gives these areas much of the same strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals.

Generally sharks have only one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, depending on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.

===Fins===
Fin skeletons are elongated and supported with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia, filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers. Most sharks have eight fins. Sharks can only drift away from objects directly in front of them because their fins do not allow them to move in the tail-first direction.

===Dermal denticles===

Unlike bony fish, sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body. This works as an outer skeleton, providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy. Their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming. Some species of shark have pigmented denticles that form complex patterns like spots (e.g. Zebra shark) and stripes (e.g. Tiger shark). These markings are important for camouflage and help sharks blend in with their environment, as well as making them difficult for prey to detect. For some species, dermal patterning returns to healed denticles even after they have been removed by injury.

===Tails===
Tails provide thrust, making speed and acceleration dependent on tail shape. Caudal fin shapes vary considerably between shark species, due to their evolution in separate environments. Sharks possess a caudal fin in which the dorsal portion is usually noticeably larger than the ventral portion. This is because the shark&#x27;s vertebral column extends into that dorsal portion, providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment. This allows more efficient locomotion among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish. By contrast, most bony fish possess a caudal fin.

Tiger sharks have a large upper lobe, which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed. The tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring, has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey. Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher shark&#x27;s usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.

==Physiology==

===Buoyancy===
Unlike bony fish, sharks do not have gas-filled swim bladders for buoyancy. Instead, sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains squalene, and their cartilage, which is about half the normal density of bone. Their liver constitutes up to 30% of their total body mass. The liver&#x27;s effectiveness is limited, so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth while swimming. Sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs, using it as a form of swim bladder. Bottom-dwelling sharks, like the nurse shark, have negative buoyancy, allowing them to rest on the ocean floor.

Some sharks, if inverted or stroked on the nose, enter a natural state of tonic immobility. Researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely.

===Respiration===
Like other fish, sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills. Unlike other fish, shark gill slits are not covered, but lie in a row behind the head. A modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye, which assists the shark with taking in water during respiration and plays a major role in bottom–dwelling sharks. Spiracles are reduced or missing in active pelagic sharks. While the shark is moving, water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as &quot;ram ventilation&quot;. While at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water. A small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest. These species are &quot;obligate ram ventilators&quot; and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move. Obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species.

The respiratory and circulatory process begins when deoxygenated venous blood travels to the shark&#x27;s two-chambered heart. Here, the shark pumps blood to its gills via the ventral aorta where it branches into branchial arteries. Gas exchange takes place in the gills and the reoxygenated blood flows into the branchial arteries, which come together to form the dorsal aorta. The blood flows from the dorsal aorta throughout the body. The deoxygenated blood from the body then flows through the posterior cardinal veins and enters the posterior cardinal sinuses. From there venous blood re-enters the heart ventricle and the cycle repeats.

===Thermoregulation===
Most sharks are &quot;cold-blooded&quot; or, more precisely, poikilothermic, meaning that their internal body temperature matches that of their ambient environment. Members of the family Lamnidae (such as the shortfin mako shark and the great white shark) are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. In these sharks, a strip of aerobic red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat, which the body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called the rete mirabile (&quot;miraculous net&quot;). The common thresher and bigeye thresher sharks have a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature.

Larger species, like the whale shark, are able to conserve their body heat through sheer size when they dive to colder depths. The scalloped hammerhead closes its mouth and gills when diving to depths of around 800 metres, holding its breath until it reaches warmer waters again.

===Osmoregulation===
In contrast to bony fish, with the exception of the coelacanth, the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea. When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.

Research in 1930 by Homer W. Smith showed that sharks&#x27; urine does not contain sufficient sodium to avoid hypernatremia, and it was postulated that there must be an additional mechanism for salt secretion. In 1960 it was discovered at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory in Salsbury Cove, Maine that sharks have a type of salt gland located at the end of the intestine, known as the &quot;rectal gland&quot;, whose function is the secretion of chlorides.

===Digestion===
Digestion can take a long time. The food moves from the mouth to a J-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial digestion occurs. Unwanted items may never get past the stomach, and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth.

One of the biggest differences between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca.

=== Fluorescence ===
A few sharks appear fluorescent under blue light, such as the swell shark and the chain catshark, where the fluorophore derives from a metabolite of kynurenic acid.

==Senses==
===Smell===
Sharks have keen olfactory senses, located in the short duct (which is not fused, unlike bony fish) between the anterior and posterior nasal openings, with some species able to detect as little as one part per million of blood in seawater. The size of the olfactory bulb varies across different shark species, with size dependent on how much a given species relies on smell or vision to find their prey. In environments with low visibility, shark species generally have larger olfactory bulbs. In reefs, where visibility is high, species of sharks from the family Carcharhinidae have smaller olfactory bulbs. Sharks found in deeper waters also have larger olfactory bulbs.

Sharks have the ability to determine the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril. This is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound.

They are more attracted to the chemicals found in the intestines of many species, and as a result often linger near or in sewage outfalls. Some species, such as nurse sharks, have external barbels that greatly increase their ability to sense prey.

===Sight===
Shark eyes are similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, including similar lenses, corneas and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment with the help of a tissue called tapetum lucidum. This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the great white shark (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important, since presumably the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark&#x27;s field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time. A micro-spectrophotometry study of 17 species of sharks found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind. The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. The study indicates that an object&#x27;s contrast against the background, rather than colour, may be more important for object detection.
===Hearing===
Although it is hard to test the hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can possibly hear prey from many miles away. The hearing sensitivity for most shark species lies between 20 and 1000 Hz.
A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.

===Electroreception===

The ampullae of Lorenzini are the electroreceptor organs. They number in the hundreds to thousands. Sharks use the ampullae of Lorenzini to detect the electromagnetic fields that all living things produce. This helps sharks (particularly the hammerhead shark) find prey. The shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal. Sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce. Ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the Earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation.

===Lateral line===
This system is found in most fish, including sharks. It is a tactile sensory system which allows the organism to detect water speed and pressure changes near by. The main component of the system is the neuromast, a cell similar to hair cells present in the vertebrate ear that interact with the surrounding aquatic environment. This helps sharks distinguish between the currents around them, obstacles off on their periphery, and struggling prey out of visual view. The shark can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50 Hz.

==Life history==


Shark lifespans vary by species. Most live 20 to 30 years. The spiny dogfish has one of the longest lifespans at more than 100 years. Whale sharks (&quot;Rhincodon typus&quot;) may also live over 100 years. Earlier estimates suggested the Greenland shark (&quot;Somniosus microcephalus&quot;) could reach about 200 years, but a recent study found that a specimen was 392 ± 120 years old (i.e., at least 272 years old), making it the longest-lived vertebrate known.

===Reproduction===
Unlike most bony fish, sharks are K-selected reproducers, meaning that they produce a small number of well-developed young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young. Fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle. Sharks mature slowly relative to many other fish. For example, lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around age 13–15.

====Sexual====
Sharks practice internal fertilization. The posterior part of a male shark&#x27;s pelvic fins are modified into a pair of intromittent organs called claspers, analogous to a mammalian penis, of which one is used to deliver sperm into the female.

Mating has rarely been observed in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel to each other while the male inserts a clasper into the female&#x27;s oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.

====Asexual====
There have been a number of documented cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a pup on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the pups had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown. Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.

Scientists say that asexual reproduction in the wild is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction may have contributed to the blue shark&#x27;s decline off the Irish coast.

===Brooding===
Sharks display three ways to bear their young, varying by species, oviparity, viviparity and ovoviviparity.

====Ovoviviparity====
Most sharks are ovoviviparous, meaning that the eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother&#x27;s body and that the egg&#x27;s yolk and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct nourishes the embryos. The young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct&#x27;s fluids. As in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. Lamniforme sharks practice &quot;oophagy&quot;, where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs. Taking this a step further, sand tiger shark pups cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos. The survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to brood the young to a comparatively large size before birth. The whale shark is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous, because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted. Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. They choose such areas for protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food. Dogfish have the longest known gestation period of any shark, at 18 to 24 months. Basking sharks and frilled sharks appear to have even longer gestation periods, but accurate data are lacking.

====Oviparity====
Some species are oviparous, laying their fertilized eggs in the water. In most oviparous shark species, an egg case with the consistency of leather protects the developing embryo(s). These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. The egg case is commonly called a &quot;mermaid&#x27;s purse&quot;. Oviparous sharks include the horn shark, catshark, Port Jackson shark, and swellshark.

====Viviparity====
Viviparity is the gestation of young without the use of a traditional egg, and results in live birth. Viviparity in sharks can be placental or aplacental. Young are born fully formed and self-sufficient. Hammerheads, the requiem sharks (such as the bull and blue sharks), and smoothhounds are viviparous.

==Behavior==
The classic view describes a solitary hunter, ranging the oceans in search of food. However, this applies to only a few species. Most live far more social, sedentary, benthic lives, and appear likely to have their own distinct personalities. Even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at rich hunting grounds, which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a year. Shark migration patterns may be even more complex than in birds, with many sharks covering entire ocean basins.

Sharks can be highly social, remaining in large schools. Sometimes more than 100 scalloped hammerheads congregate around seamounts and islands, e.g., in the Gulf of California. Cross-species social hierarchies exist. For example, oceanic whitetip sharks dominate silky sharks of comparable size during feeding.

When approached too closely some sharks perform a threat display. This usually consists of exaggerated swimming movements, and can vary in intensity according to the threat level.

===Speed===
In general, sharks swim (&quot;cruise&quot;) at an average speed of , but when feeding or attacking, the average shark can reach speeds upwards of . The shortfin mako shark, the fastest shark and one of the fastest fish, can burst at speeds up to . The great white shark is also capable of speed bursts. These exceptions may be due to the warm-blooded, or homeothermic, nature of these sharks&#x27; physiology. Sharks can travel 70 to 80 km in a day.

===Intelligence===

Sharks possess brain-to-body mass ratios that are similar to mammals and birds, and have exhibited apparent curiosity and behavior resembling play in the wild.

There is evidence that juvenile lemon sharks can use observational learning in their investigation of novel objects in their environment.

===Sleep===
All sharks need to keep water flowing over their gills in order for them to breathe; however, not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that are able to breathe while not swimming do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.

Species that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the spiny dogfish that its spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping, and this also may be the case in larger shark species. In 2016 a great white shark was captured on video for the first time in a state researchers believed was sleep swimming.

==Ecology==
===Feeding===

Most sharks are carnivorous. Basking sharks, whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows from time to time in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.

Other highly specialized feeders include cookiecutter sharks, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals. Cookiecutter teeth are enormous compared to the animal&#x27;s size. The lower teeth are particularly sharp. Although they have never been observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their bodies to rip off flesh.

Some seabed–dwelling species are highly effective ambush predators. Angel sharks and wobbegongs use camouflage to lie in wait and suck prey into their mouths. Many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth.

Other sharks feed on squid or fish, which they swallow whole. The viper dogfish has teeth it can point outwards to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact. The great white and other large predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded rostra.

The bonnethead shark is the only known omnivorous species. Its main prey is crustaceans and mollusks, but it also eats a large amount of seagrass, and is able to digest and extract nutrients from about 50% of the seagrass it consume.

Many sharks, including the whitetip reef shark are cooperative feeders and hunt in packs to herd and capture elusive prey. These social sharks are often migratory, traveling huge distances around ocean basins in large schools. These migrations may be partly necessary to find new food sources.

===Range and habitat===
Sharks are found in all seas. They generally do not live in fresh water, with a few exceptions such as the bull shark and the river shark which can swim both in seawater and freshwater. Sharks are common down to depths of , and some live even deeper, but they are almost entirely absent below . The deepest confirmed report of a shark is a Portuguese dogfish at .

==Relationship with humans==
===Attacks===


In 2006 the International Shark Attack File (ISAF) undertook an investigation into 96 alleged shark attacks, confirming 62 of them as unprovoked attacks and 16 as provoked attacks. The average number of fatalities worldwide per year between 2001 and 2006 from unprovoked shark attacks is 4.3.

Contrary to popular belief, only a few sharks are dangerous to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. Despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.

The perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the &quot;Jaws&quot; film series. &quot;Jaws&quot; author Peter Benchley, as well as &quot;Jaws&quot; director Steven Spielberg, later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters.

To help avoid an unprovoked attack, humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much.

In general, sharks show little pattern of attacking humans specifically, part of the reason could be that sharks prefer the blood of fish and other common preys. Research indicates that when humans do become the object of a shark attack, it is possible that the shark has mistaken the human for species that are its normal prey, such as seals. This was further proven in a recent study conducted by researchers at the California State University&#x27;s Shark Lab. According to footage caught by the Lab&#x27;s drones, juveniles swam right up to humans in the water without any bites incidents. The lab stated that the results showed that humans and sharks can co-exist in the water.

===In captivity===

Until recently, only a few benthic species of shark, such as hornsharks, leopard sharks and catsharks, had survived in aquarium conditions for a year or more. This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. More knowledge has led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks) living far longer in captivity, along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long-distance transportation. The great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long periods of time until September 2004, when the Monterey Bay Aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her.

Most species are not suitable for home aquaria, and not every species sold by pet stores are appropriate. Some species can flourish in home saltwater aquaria. Uninformed or unscrupulous dealers sometimes sell juvenile sharks like the nurse shark, which upon reaching adulthood is far too large for typical home aquaria. Public aquaria generally do not accept donated specimens that have outgrown their housing. Some owners have been tempted to release them. Species appropriate to home aquaria represent considerable spatial and financial investments as they generally approach adult lengths of and can live up to 25 years.
===In culture===
====In Hawaii====
Sharks figure prominently in Hawaiian mythology. Stories tell of men with shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. Hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. Among a fishing people, the most popular of all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. Kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. The body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark&#x27;s body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved&#x27;s body had been wrapped. Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.

Kamohoali&#x27;i is the best known and revered of the shark gods, he was the older and favored brother of Pele, and helped and journeyed with her to Hawaii. He was able to assume all human and fish forms. A summit cliff on the crater of Kilauea is one of his most sacred spots. At one point he had a &quot;heiau&quot; (temple or shrine) dedicated to him on every piece of land that jutted into the ocean on the island of Molokai. Kamohoali&#x27;i was an ancestral god, not a human who became a shark and banned the eating of humans after eating one herself. In Fijian mythology, Dakuwaqa was a shark god who was the eater of lost souls.

====In American Samoa====
On the island of Tutuila in American Samoa (a U.S. territory), there is a location called Turtle and Shark (&quot;Laumei ma Malie&quot;) which is important in Samoan culture—the location is the site of a legend called &quot;O Le Tala I Le Laumei Ma Le Malie&quot;, in which two humans are said to have transformed into a turtle and a shark. According to the U.S. National Park Service, &quot;Villagers from nearby Vaitogi continue to reenact an important aspect of the legend at Turtle and Shark by performing a ritual song intended to summon the legendary animals to the ocean surface, and visitors are frequently amazed to see one or both of these creatures emerge from the sea in apparent response to this call.&quot;

====In popular culture====
In contrast to the complex portrayals by Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, the European and Western view of sharks has historically been mostly of fear and malevolence. Sharks are used in popular culture commonly as eating machines, notably in the &quot;Jaws&quot; novel and the film of the same name, along with its sequels. Sharks are threats in other films such as &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;, &quot;The Reef&quot;, and others, although they are sometimes used for comedic effect such as in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; series. Sharks tend to be seen quite often in cartoons whenever a scene involves the ocean. Such examples include the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons, &quot;Jabberjaw&quot;, and other shows produced by Hanna-Barbera. They also are used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them, or the character may be standing on a plank above shark infested waters.

====Popular misconceptions====
A popular myth is that sharks are immune to disease and cancer, but this is not scientifically supported. Sharks have been known to get cancer. Both diseases and parasites affect sharks. The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few, if any, scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease.
Other apparently false claims are that fins prevent cancer and treat osteoarthritis. No scientific proof supports these claims; at least one study has shown shark cartilage of no value in cancer treatment.

In 2008, it was estimated that nearly 100 million sharks were being killed by people every year, due to commercial and recreational fishing. In 2021, it was estimated that the population of oceanic sharks and rays had dropped by 71% over the previous half-century.

Shark finning yields are estimated at for 2000, and for 2010. Based on an analysis of average shark weights, this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000, and about 97 million sharks in 2010, with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year. Sharks are a common seafood in many places, including Japan and Australia. In southern Australia, shark is commonly used in fish and chips, in which fillets are battered and deep-fried or crumbed and grilled. In fish and chip shops, shark is called flake. In India, small sharks or baby sharks (called sora in Tamil language, Telugu language) are sold in local markets. Since the flesh is not developed, cooking the flesh breaks it into powder, which is then fried in oil and spices (called sora puttu/sora poratu). The soft bones can be easily chewed, they are considered a delicacy in coastal Tamil Nadu. Icelanders ferment Greenland sharks to produce a delicacy called hákarl. During a four-year period from 1996 to 2000, an estimated 26 to 73 million sharks were killed and traded annually in commercial markets.

Sharks are often killed for shark fin soup. Fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and dump the finless animal back into the water. Shark finning involves removing the fin with a hot metal blade. The resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators. Shark fin has become a major trade within black markets all over the world. Fins sell for about $300/lb in 2009. Poachers illegally fin millions each year. Few governments enforce laws that protect them. In 2010 Hawaii became the first U.S. state to prohibit the possession, sale, trade or distribution of shark fins. From 1996 to 2000, an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins. It is estimated by TRAFFIC that over 14,000 tonnes of shark fins were exported into Singapore between 2005–2007 and 2012–2014.

Shark fin soup is a status symbol in Asian countries and is erroneously considered healthy and full of nutrients. Scientific research has revealed, however, that high concentrations of BMAA are present in shark fins. Because BMAA is a neurotoxin, consumption of shark fin soup and cartilage pills, therefore, may pose a health risk. BMAA is under study for its pathological role in neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Sharks are also killed for meat. European diners consume dogfishes, smoothhounds, catsharks, makos, porbeagle and also skates and rays. However, the U.S. FDA lists sharks as one of four fish (with swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish) whose high mercury content is hazardous to children and pregnant women.

Sharks generally reach sexual maturity only after many years and produce few offspring in comparison to other harvested fish. Harvesting sharks before they reproduce severely impacts future populations. Capture induced premature birth and abortion (collectively called capture-induced parturition) occurs frequently in sharks/rays when fished. Capture-induced parturition is rarely considered in fisheries management despite being shown to occur in at least 12% of live bearing sharks and rays (88 species to date).

The majority of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management. The rise in demand for shark products increases pressure on fisheries. Major declines in shark stocks have been recorded—some species have been depleted by over 90% over the past 20–30 years with population declines of 70% not unusual. A study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature suggests that one quarter of all known species of sharks and rays are threatened by extinction and 25 species were classified as critically endangered.

===Shark culling===
In 2014, a shark cull in Western Australia killed dozens of sharks (mostly tiger sharks) using drum lines, until it was cancelled after public protests and a decision by the Western Australia EPA; from 2014 to 2017, there was an &quot;imminent threat&quot; policy in Western Australia in which sharks that &quot;threatened&quot; humans in the ocean were shot and killed. This &quot;imminent threat&quot; policy was criticized by senator Rachel Siewart for killing endangered sharks. The &quot;imminent threat&quot; policy was cancelled in March 2017. In August 2018, the Western Australia government announced a plan to re-introduce drum lines (though, this time the drum lines are &quot;SMART&quot; drum lines).

From 1962 to the present, the government of Queensland has targeted and killed sharks in large numbers by using drum lines, under a &quot;shark control&quot; program—this program has also inadvertently killed large numbers of other animals such as dolphins; it has also killed endangered hammerhead sharks. Queensland&#x27;s drum line program has been called &quot;outdated, cruel and ineffective&quot;. From 2001 to 2018, a total of 10,480 sharks were killed on lethal drum lines in Queensland, including in the Great Barrier Reef. From 1962 to 2018, roughly 50,000 sharks were killed by Queensland authorities.

The government of New South Wales has a program that deliberately kills sharks using nets. The current net program in New South Wales has been described as being &quot;extremely destructive&quot; to marine life, including sharks. Between 1950 and 2008, 352 tiger sharks and 577 great white sharks were killed in the nets in New South Wales—also during this period, a total of 15,135 marine animals were killed in the nets, including dolphins, whales, turtles, dugongs, and critically endangered grey nurse sharks. There has been a very large decrease in the number of sharks in eastern Australia, and the shark-killing programs in Queensland and New South Wales are partly responsible for this decrease.

Kwazulu-Natal, an area of South Africa, has a shark-killing program using nets and drum lines—these nets and drum lines have killed turtles and dolphins, and have been criticized for killing wildlife. During a 30-year period, more than 33,000 sharks have been killed in KwaZulu-Natal&#x27;s shark-killing program—during the same 30-year period, 2,211 turtles, 8,448 rays, and 2,310 dolphins were killed in KwaZulu-Natal. Authorities on the French island of Réunion kill about 100 sharks per year.

Killing sharks negatively affects the marine ecosystem. Jessica Morris of Humane Society International calls shark culling a &quot;knee-jerk reaction&quot; and says, &quot;sharks are top order predators that play an important role in the functioning of marine ecosystems. We need them for healthy oceans.&quot;

George H. Burgess, the former director of the International Shark Attack File, &quot;describes [shark] culling as a form of revenge, satisfying a public demand for blood and little else&quot;; he also said shark culling is a &quot;retro-type move reminiscent of what people would have done in the 1940s and 50s, back when we didn&#x27;t have an ecological conscience and before we knew the consequences of our actions.&quot; Jane Williamson, an associate professor in marine ecology at Macquarie University, says &quot;There is no scientific support for the concept that culling sharks in a particular area will lead to a decrease in shark attacks and increase ocean safety.&quot;

===Other threats===
Other threats include habitat alteration, damage and loss from coastal development, pollution and the impact of fisheries on the seabed and prey species. The 2007 documentary &quot;Sharkwater&quot; exposed how sharks are being hunted to extinction.

==Conservation==
In 1991, South Africa was the first country in the world to declare Great White sharks a legally protected species (however, the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board is allowed to kill great white sharks in its &quot;shark control&quot; program in eastern South Africa).

Intending to ban the practice of shark finning while at sea, the United States Congress passed the Shark Finning Prohibition Act in 2000. Two years later the Act saw its first legal challenge in &quot;United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins&quot;. In 2008 a Federal Appeals Court ruled that a loophole in the law allowed non-fishing vessels to &quot;purchase&quot; shark fins from fishing vessels while on the high seas. Seeking to close the loophole, the Shark Conservation Act was passed by Congress in December 2010, and it was signed into law in January 2011.

In 2003, the European Union introduced a general shark finning ban for all vessels of all nationalities in Union waters and for all vessels flying a flag of one of its member states. This prohibition was amended in June 2013 to close remaining loopholes.

In 2009, the International Union for Conservation of Nature&#x27;s &quot;IUCN Red List of Endangered Species&quot; named 64 species, one-third of all oceanic shark species, as being at risk of extinction due to fishing and shark finning.

In 2010, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) rejected proposals from the United States and Palau that would have required countries to strictly regulate trade in several species of scalloped hammerhead, oceanic whitetip and spiny dogfish sharks. The majority, but not the required two-thirds of voting delegates, approved the proposal. China, by far the world&#x27;s largest shark market, and Japan, which battles all attempts to extend the convention to marine species, led the opposition. In March 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to Appendix 2 of CITES, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.

In 2010, Greenpeace International added the school shark, shortfin mako shark, mackerel shark, tiger shark and spiny dogfish to its seafood red list, a list of common supermarket fish that are often sourced from unsustainable fisheries. Advocacy group Shark Trust campaigns to limit shark fishing. Advocacy group Seafood Watch directs American consumers to not eat sharks.

Under the auspices of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), also known as the Bonn Convention, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks was concluded and came into effect in March 2010. It was the first global instrument concluded under CMS and aims at facilitating international coordination for the protection, conservation and management of migratory sharks, through multilateral, intergovernmental discussion and scientific research.

In July 2013, New York state, a major market and entry point for shark fins, banned the shark fin trade joining seven other states of the United States and the three Pacific U.S. territories in providing legal protection to sharks.

In the United States, and as of January 16, 2019, 12 states including (Massachusetts, Maryland, Delaware, California, Illinois, Hawaii, Oregon, Nevada, Rhode Island, Washington, New York and Texas) along with 3 U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands) have passed laws against the sale or possession of shark fins.

Several regions now have shark sanctuaries or have banned shark fishing—these regions include American Samoa, the Bahamas, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Guam, the Maldives, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau.

In April 2020 researchers reported to have traced the origins of shark fins of endangered hammerhead sharks from a retail market in Hong Kong back to their source populations and therefore the approximate locations where the sharks were first caught using DNA analysis.

In July 2020 scientists reported results of a survey of 371 reefs in 58 nations estimating the conservation status of reef sharks globally. No sharks have been observed on almost 20% of the surveyed reefs and shark depletion was strongly associated with both socio-economic conditions and conservation measures. Sharks are considered to be a vital part of the ocean ecosystem.

According to a 2021 study in &quot;Nature&quot;, overfishing has resulted in a 71% global decline in the number of oceanic sharks and rays over the preceding 50 years. The oceanic whitetip, and both the scalloped hammerhead and great hammerheads are now classified as critically endangered. Sharks in tropical waters have declined more rapidly than those in temperate zones during the period studied. A 2021 study published in &quot;Current Biology&quot; found that overfishing is currently driving over one-third of sharks and rays to extinction.

<text>A black panther is the melanistic colour variant of the leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;) and the jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;). Black panthers of both species have excess black pigments, but their typical rosettes are also present. They have been documented mostly in tropical forests, with black leopards in Africa and Asia, and black jaguars in Central and South America. Melanism is caused by a recessive allele in the leopard, and by a dominant allele in the jaguar.

==Leopard==

In 1788, Jean-Claude Delamétherie described a black leopard that was kept in the Tower of London and had been brought from Bengal. In 1794, Friedrich Albrecht Anton Meyer proposed the scientific name &quot;Felis fusca&quot; for this cat, the Indian leopard (&quot;P. p. fusca&quot;).
In 1809, Georges Cuvier described a black leopard kept in the Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes that had been brought from Java. Cuvier proposed the name &quot;Felis melas&quot;, the Javan leopard (&quot;P. p. melas&quot;). By the late 19th century, the occurrence of black and spotted leopard cubs in the same litter had been repeatedly recorded in India. Black leopards were thought to be more common in Travancore and in the hills of southern India than in other parts of the country. Black leopards were also frequently encountered in southern Myanmar.
By 1929, the Natural History Museum, London had skins of black leopards collected in South Africa, Nepal, Assam and Kanara in India. Black leopards were thought to be common on the Malay Peninsula and on Java.

A black African leopard (&quot;P. p. pardus&quot;) was sighted in the alpine zone of Mount Kenya in the winter of 1989–1990.
In Kenya&#x27;s Laikipia County, a black leopard was photographed by a camera trap in 2007; in 2018, a female subadult black leopard was repeatedly recorded together with a spotted leopard about farther east in a grassland.

In India&#x27;s Western Ghats, black leopards were sighted and photographed in 2010 and 2012 in the Kas Plateau Reserved Forest, and in Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary in 2012. In 2015, a dead black leopard was found on a highway near Satara in Maharashtra.
In May 2012, a black leopard was photographed at an elevation of in Nepal&#x27;s Kanchenjunga Conservation Area.

At least one black leopard was photographed in mixed deciduous forest in Thailand&#x27;s Kaeng Krachan National Park during a one-year-long camera trapping survey from 2003 to 2004. In 2009, black leopards were photographed more often than spotted leopards in Kui Buri National Park.
Most leopards recorded at 16 sites south of the Kra Isthmus between 1996 and 2009 were black, indicating a near-fixation of melanism in Peninsular Malaysia. In 2019, a black individual was photographed outside a protected area in Jeli District.
Both black and spotted leopards were recorded in Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park in West Java between 2005 and 2017.

Frequency of melanism appears to be approximately 11% over the leopard&#x27;s range. Data on the distribution of leopard populations indicates that melanism occurs in five subspecies in the wild: the Indian leopard, Javan leopard, African leopard, Indochinese leopard (&quot;P. p. delacouri&quot;) and Sri Lankan leopard (&quot;P. p. kotiya&quot;). Based on records from camera traps, melanistic leopards occur foremost in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests.

Melanism in the leopard is conferred by a recessive allele.
It is thought that melanism confers a selective advantage under certain conditions since it is more common in regions of dense forest, where light levels are lower. Preliminary studies also suggest that melanism might be linked to beneficial mutations in the immune system.
The typical spots and rosettes are present but hidden due to the excess melanin.

The taxonomic status of captive black leopards and the extent of hybridization between the Javan leopard and other leopard subspecies is uncertain. Therefore, coordinated breeding programs for black leopards do not exist in European and North American zoos. Black leopards occupy space needed for breeding endangered leopard subspecies and are not included within the North American Species Survival Plan.
A black Amur leopard (&quot;P. p. orientalis&quot;) was exhibited at the San Diego Zoo in 2017.

A pseudo-melanistic leopard has a normal background color, but the spots are more densely packed than normal, and merge to obscure the golden-brown background color. Any spots on the flanks and limbs that have not merged into the mass of swirls and stripes are unusually small and discrete, rather than forming rosettes. The face and underparts are paler and dappled, like those of ordinary spotted leopards.

==Jaguar==

In 1801, Félix de Azara described a black jaguar observed by local people near the Paraná River in Paraguay.
In 2004, a female black jaguar was recorded in Mexico&#x27;s Sierra Madre Occidental.
In 2009, a black jaguar was photographed by a camera trap for the first time in Costa Rica&#x27;s Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve.
In Barbilla National Park, black jaguars were recorded in 2013.
In the mountains of the Cordillera de Talamanca, 104 records of jaguars were obtained between 2010 and 2019; 26 of them showed melanistic jaguars. 
In eastern Panama, black jaguars were repeatedly photographed in the Mamoní River Valley between 2016 and 2018, mostly in primary forest. Five black jaguars have been monitored in the Várzea forest of Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve in the Brazilian State of Amazonas between 2003 and 2018.
Black jaguars were also recorded in the Brazilian Pará state.

Melanism in the jaguar is caused by deletions in the melanocortin 1 receptor gene and conferred by a dominant allele.

== In the United States ==
There have been numerous reported black panther sightings in the New Orleans area since late 2010. Recent photographs are still under examination by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife &amp; Fisheries.

In Florida, a few melanistic bobcats have been captured; these have apparently been mistaken for Florida panthers (a subspecies of cougar). Ulmer (1941) presents photographs and descriptions of two animals captured in Martin County in 1939 and 1940. In the photographs, they appear black, and one of the hunters called them black.
The Academy specimen, upon close examination, is far from black. The most heavily pigmented portions are the crown and dorsal area. In most lights these areas appear black, but at certain angles the dorsal strip has a decidedly mahogany tint. The mahogany coloring becomes lighter and richer on the sides. The underparts are lightest, being almost ferruginous in color. The chin, throat and cheeks are dark chocolate-brown, but the facial stripes can be seen clearly. The limbs are dark mahogany. In certain lights the typical spot-pattern of the Florida bobcat can be distinctly seen on the side, underparts and limbs. The Bronx Park animal appears darker and the spots are not visible, although the poor light in the quarantine cage may have been the reason.

== In Australia ==
Black panther sightings are frequently recorded in rural Victoria and New South Wales
The &quot;Animal X Natural Mysteries Unit&quot; led an investigation into the phantom panther. Mike Williams, a local researcher, said he had sent scat and hair found by locals to labs for analysis, which identified it as scat from dogs that had feasted on swamp wallaby, and hair from a domestic cat. Williams said he also had leopard scat and hair collected from a private zoo tested by one of the same labs, but that these samples came back with the same results of dog scat and domestic cat hair. The lab used was not identified in the episode.

==Cougar==
There is no authenticated case of a truly melanistic cougar. No specimen has been photographed or killed in the wild, nor has it ever been bred in captivity. Unconfirmed sightings known as the &quot;North American black panther&quot; are currently attributed to errors in species identification by non-experts, and by the mimetic exaggeration of size.

<text>The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the white shark, white pointer, or simply great white, is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. It is the only known surviving species of its genus &quot;Carcharodon&quot;. The great white shark is notable for its size, with the largest preserved female specimen measuring in length and around in weight at maturity. However, most are smaller; males measure , and females measure on average. According to a 2014 study, the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above previous estimates, making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fishes currently known. According to the same study, male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring. Great white sharks can swim at speeds of 25 km/h (16 mph) for short bursts and to depths of .

The great white shark is arguably the world&#x27;s largest-known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals, such as pinnipeds and dolphins. The great white shark is also known to prey upon a variety of other animals, including fish, other sharks, and seabirds. It has only one recorded natural predator, the orca.

The species faces numerous ecological challenges which has resulted in international protection. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the great white shark as a vulnerable species, and it is included in Appendix II of CITES. It is also protected by several national governments, such as Australia (as of 2018). Due to their need to travel long distances for seasonal migration and extremely demanding diet, it is not logistically feasible to keep great white sharks in captivity; because of this, while attempts have been made to do so in the past, there are no known aquariums in the world believed to house a live specimen.

The great white shark is depicted in popular culture as a ferocious man-eater, largely as a result of the novel &quot;Jaws&quot; by Peter Benchley and its subsequent film adaptation by Steven Spielberg. Humans are not a preferred prey, but nevertheless it is responsible for the largest number of reported and identified fatal unprovoked shark attacks on humans. However, attacks are rare, typically occurring fewer than 10 times per year globally.

== Taxonomy ==
The great white is the sole recognized extant species in the genus &quot;Carcharodon&quot;, and is one of five extant species belonging to the family Lamnidae. Other members of this family include the mako sharks, porbeagle, and salmon shark. The family belongs to the Lamniformes, the order of mackerel sharks.

=== Etymology and naming history ===

The English name &#x27;white shark&#x27; and its Australian variant &#x27;white pointer&#x27; is thought to have come from the shark&#x27;s stark white underside, a characteristic feature most noticeable in beached sharks lying upside down with their bellies exposed. Colloquial use favours the name &#x27;great white shark&#x27;, with &#x27;great&#x27; perhaps stressing the size and prowess of the species, and &quot;white shark&quot; having historically been used to describe the much smaller oceanic white-tipped shark, later referred to for a time as the &quot;lesser white shark&quot;. Most scientists prefer &#x27;white shark&#x27;, as the name &quot;lesser white shark&quot; is no longer used, while some use &#x27;white shark&#x27; to refer to all members of the Lamnidae.

The scientific genus name &quot;Carcharodon&quot; literally means &quot;jagged tooth&quot;, a reference to the large serrations that appear in the shark&#x27;s teeth. It is a portmanteau of two Ancient Greek words: the prefix &quot;carchar-&quot; is derived from (&quot;kárkharos&quot;), which means &quot;jagged&quot; or &quot;sharp&quot;. The suffix &quot;-odon&quot; is a romanization of (&quot;odṓn&quot;), a which translates to &quot;tooth&quot;. The specific name &quot;carcharias&quot; is a Latinization of (&quot;karkharías&quot;), the Ancient Greek word for shark.
The great white shark was one of the species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 &quot;10th edition of Systema Naturae&quot;, in which it was identified as an amphibian and assigned the scientific name &quot;Squalus carcharias&quot;, &quot;Squalus&quot; being the genus that he placed all sharks in. By the 1810s, it was recognized that the shark should be placed in a new genus, but it was not until 1838 when Sir Andrew Smith coined the name &quot;Carcharodon&quot; as the new genus.

There have been a few attempts to describe and classify the great white before Linnaeus. One of its earliest mentions in literature as a distinct type of animal appears in Pierre Belon&#x27;s 1553 book &quot;De aquatilibus duo, cum eiconibus ad vivam ipsorum effigiem quoad ejus fieri potuit, ad amplissimum cardinalem Castilioneum&quot;. In it, he illustrated and described the shark under the name &quot;Canis carcharias&quot; based on the jagged nature of its teeth and its alleged similarities with dogs. Another name used for the great white around this time was &quot;Lamia&quot;, first coined by Guillaume Rondelet in his 1554 book &quot;Libri de Piscibus Marinis&quot;, who also identified it as the fish that swallowed the prophet Jonah in biblical texts. Linnaeus recognized both names as previous classifications.

=== Fossil ancestry ===

Molecular clock studies published between 1988 and 2002 determined the closest living relative of the great white to be the mako sharks of the genus &quot;Isurus&quot;, which diverged some time between 60 and 43 million years ago. Tracing this evolutionary relationship through fossil evidence, however, remains subject to further paleontological study.

The original hypothesis of the great white shark&#x27;s origin held that it is a descendant of a lineage of mega-toothed sharks, and is closely related to the prehistoric megalodon. These sharks were considerably larger in size, with megalodon attaining an estimated length of up to . Similarities between the teeth of great white and mega-toothed sharks, such as large triangular shapes, serrated blades, and the presence of dental bands, led the primary evidence of a close evolutionary relationship. As a result, scientists classified the ancient forms under the genus &quot;Carcharodon&quot;. Although weaknesses in the hypothesis existed, such as uncertainty over exactly which species evolved into the modern great white and multiple gaps in the fossil record, palaeontologists were able to chart the hypothetical lineage back to a 60-million-year-old shark known as &quot;Cretalamna&quot; as the common ancestor of all sharks within the Lamnidae.
However, it is now understood that the great white shark holds closer ties to the mako sharks and is descended from a separate lineage as a chronospecies unrelated to the mega-toothed sharks. This was proven with the discovery of a transitional species that connected the great white to an unserrated shark known as &quot;Carcharodon hastalis&quot;. This transitional species, which was named &quot;Carcharodon hubbelli&quot; in 2012, demonstrated a mosaic of evolutionary transitions between the great white and &quot;C. hastalis&quot;, namely the gradual appearance of serrations, in a span of between 8 and 5 million years ago. The progression of &quot;C. hubbelli&quot; characterized shifting diets and niches; by 6.5 million years ago, the serrations were developed enough for &quot;C. hubbelli&quot; to handle marine mammals. Although both the great white and &quot;C. hastalis&quot; were known worldwide, &quot;C. hubbelli&quot; is primarily found in California, Peru, Chile, and surrounding coastal deposits, indicating that the great white had Pacific origins. &quot;C. hastalis&quot; continued to thrive alongside the great white until its last appearance around one million years ago and is believed to have possibly sired a number of additional species, including &quot;Carcharodon subserratus&quot; and &quot;Carcharodon plicatilis&quot;.

However, Yun argued that the tooth fossil remains of &quot;C. hastalis&quot; and Great White Shark &quot;have been documented from the same deposits, hence the former cannot be a chronospecific ancestor of the latter.&quot; He also criticized that the &quot;C. hastalis&quot; &quot;morphotype has never been tested through phylogenetic analyses,&quot; and denoted that as of 2021, the argument that the modern Carcharodon lineage with narrow, serrated teeth evolved from &quot;C. hastalis&quot; with a broad, unserrated teeth is uncertain.

Tracing beyond &quot;C. hastalis&quot;, another prevailing hypothesis proposes that the great white and mako lineages shared a common ancestor in a primitive mako-like species. The identity of this ancestor is still debated, but a potential species includes &quot;Isurolamna inflata&quot;, which lived between 65 and 55 million years ago. It is hypothesized that the great white and mako lineages split with the rise of two separate descendants, the one representing the great white shark lineage being &quot;Macrorhizodus praecursor&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Great white sharks live in almost all coastal and offshore waters which have water temperature between , with greater concentrations in the United States (Northeast and California), South Africa, Japan, Oceania, Chile, and the Mediterranean including the Sea of Marmara and Bosphorus. One of the densest-known populations is found around Dyer Island, South Africa. Juvenile great white sharks inhabit a more narrow band of temperatures, between , in shallow coastal nurseries. Increased observation of young sharks in areas they were not previously common, such as Monterey Bay on the Central California coast, suggest climate change may be reducing the range of juvenile great white sharks and shifting it toward the poles.

The great white is an epipelagic fish, observed mostly in the presence of rich game, such as fur seals (&quot;Arctocephalus&quot; ssp.), sea lions, cetaceans, other sharks, and large bony fish species. In the open ocean, it has been recorded at depths as great as . These findings challenge the traditional notion that the great white is a coastal species.

According to a recent study, California great whites have migrated to an area between Baja California Peninsula and Hawaii known as the White Shark Café to spend at least 100 days before migrating back to Baja. On the journey out, they swim slowly and dive down to around . After they arrive, they change behaviour and do short dives to about for up to ten minutes. Another white shark that was tagged off the South African coast swam to the southern coast of Australia and back within the year. A similar study tracked a different great white shark from South Africa swimming to Australia&#x27;s northwestern coast and back, a journey of in under nine months.
These observations argue against traditional theories that white sharks are coastal territorial predators, and open up the possibility of interaction between shark populations that were previously thought to have been discrete. The reasons for their migration and what they do at their destination is still unknown. Possibilities include seasonal feeding or mating.

In the Northwest Atlantic, the white shark populations off the New England coast were nearly eradicated due to over-fishing. In recent years, the populations have grown greatly, largely due to the increase in seal populations on Cape Cod, Massachusetts since the enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972. Currently very little is known about the hunting and movement patterns of great whites off Cape Cod, but ongoing studies hope to offer insight into this growing shark population. The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries (part of the Department of Fish and Game) began a population study in 2014; since 2019, this research has focused on how humans can avoid conflict with sharks. Scientists believe all North Atlantic great white sharks spend their first year of life near New York City, off the coast of Long Island.

A 2018 study indicated that white sharks prefer to congregate deep in anticyclonic eddies in the North Atlantic Ocean. The sharks studied tended to favour the warm-water eddies, spending the daytime hours at depths of and coming to the surface at night.

== Anatomy and appearance ==
The great white shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are approximately the same size which is similar to some mackerel sharks. A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark&#x27;s outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight.

Leucism is extremely rare in this species, but has been documented at least three times; in a pup that washed ashore in Australia and died, in another pup in South Africa, and a third six-metre adult male in Indonesia. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh. Great white sharks, like other mackerel sharks, have larger eyes than other shark species in proportion to their body size. The iris of the eye is a deep blue instead of black.

=== Size ===
In great white sharks, sexual dimorphism is present, and females are generally larger than males. Male great whites on average measure in length, while females measure . Adults of this species weigh on average; however, mature females can have an average mass of . The largest females have been verified up to in length and an estimated in weight, perhaps up to . The maximum size is subject to debate because some reports are rough estimations or speculations performed under questionable circumstances. Among living cartilaginous fish, only the whale shark (&quot;Rhincodon typus&quot;), the basking shark (&quot;Cetorhinus maximus&quot;) and the giant manta ray (&quot;Manta birostris&quot;), in that order, are on average larger and heavier. These three species are generally quite docile in disposition and given to passively filter-feeding on very small organisms. This makes the great white shark the largest extant macropredatory fish. Great white sharks measure approximately when born, and grow about every year.

A complete female great white shark specimen in the Museum of Zoology in Lausanne, and claimed by De Maddalena &quot;et al.&quot; (2003) as the largest preserved specimen, measured in total body length with the caudal fin in its depressed position, and is estimated to have weighed . According to J. E. Randall, the largest white shark reliably measured was a specimen reported from Ledge Point, Western Australia in 1987, but it is unclear whether that length was measured with the caudal fin in its depressed or natural position. Another great white specimen of similar size was a female caught in August 1988 in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, off Prince Edward Island, by David McKendrick of Alberton, Prince Edward Island. This female great white was long, as verified by the Canadian Shark Research Center.

A report of a specimen reportedly measuring in length and with a body mass estimated at caught in 1945 off the coast of Cuba was at the time considered reliable by some experts. However, later studies revealed this particular specimen to be around in length, &quot;i.e.&quot; a specimen within the typical maximum size range.

The largest great white recognized by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) is one caught by Alf Dean in southern Australian waters in 1959, weighing .

==== Examples of large unconfirmed great whites ====
A number of very large unconfirmed great white shark specimens have been recorded. For decades, many ichthyological works, as well as the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, listed two great white sharks as the largest individuals: In the 1870s, a great white captured in southern Australian waters, near Port Fairy, and an shark trapped in a herring weir in New Brunswick, Canada, in the 1930s. However, these measurements were not obtained in a rigorous, scientifically valid manner, and researchers have questioned the reliability of these measurements for a long time, noting they were much larger than any other accurately reported sighting. Later studies proved these doubts to be well-founded. This New Brunswick shark may have been a misidentified basking shark, as the two have similar body shapes. The question of the Port Fairy shark was settled in the 1970s when J. E. Randall examined the shark&#x27;s jaws and &quot;found that the Port Fairy shark was of the order of in length and suggested that a mistake had been made in the original record, in 1870, of the shark&#x27;s length&quot;.

While these measurements have not been confirmed, some great white sharks caught in modern times have been estimated to be more than long, but these claims have received some criticism. However, J. E. Randall believed that great white shark may have exceeded in length. A great white shark was captured near Kangaroo Island in Australia on 1 April 1987. This shark was estimated to be more than long by Peter Resiley, and has been designated as KANGA. Another great white shark was caught in Malta by Alfredo Cutajar on 16 April 1987. This shark was also estimated to be around long by John Abela and has been designated as MALTA. However, Cappo drew criticism because he used shark size estimation methods proposed by J. E. Randall to suggest that the KANGA specimen was long. In a similar fashion, I. K. Fergusson also used shark size estimation methods proposed by J. E. Randall to suggest that the MALTA specimen was long. However, photographic evidence suggested that these specimens were larger than the size estimations yielded through Randall&#x27;s methods. Thus, a team of scientists—H. F. Mollet, G. M. Cailliet, A. P. Klimley, D. A. Ebert, A. D. Testi, and L. J. V. Compagno—reviewed the cases of the KANGA and MALTA specimens in 1996 to resolve the dispute by conducting a comprehensive morphometric analysis of the remains of these sharks and re-examination of photographic evidence in an attempt to validate the original size estimations and their findings were consistent with them. The findings indicated that estimations by P. Resiley and J. Abela are reasonable and could not be ruled out. A particularly large female great white nicknamed &quot;Deep Blue&quot;, estimated measuring at was filmed off Guadalupe during shooting for the 2014 episode of &quot;Shark Week&quot; &quot;Jaws Strikes Back&quot;. Deep Blue would also later gain significant attention when she was filmed interacting with researcher Mauricio Hoyas Pallida in a viral video that Mauricio posted on Facebook on 11 June 2015. Deep Blue was later seen off Oahu in January 2019 while scavenging a sperm whale carcass, whereupon she was filmed swimming beside divers including dive tourism operator and model Ocean Ramsey in open water. A particularly infamous great white shark, supposedly of record proportions, once patrolled the area that comprises False Bay, South Africa, was said to be well over during the early 1980s. This shark, known locally as the &quot;Submarine&quot;, had a legendary reputation that was supposedly well-founded. Though rumours have stated this shark was exaggerated in size or non-existent altogether, witness accounts by the then young Craig Anthony Ferreira, a notable shark expert in South Africa, and his father indicate an unusually large animal of considerable size and power (though it remains uncertain just how massive the shark was as it escaped capture each time it was hooked). Ferreira describes the four encounters with the giant shark he participated in with great detail in his book &quot;Great White Sharks On Their Best Behavior&quot;.

One contender in maximum size among the predatory sharks is the tiger shark (&quot;Galeocerdo cuvier&quot;). While tiger sharks, which are typically both a few feet smaller and have a leaner, less heavy body structure than white sharks, have been confirmed to reach at least in the length, an unverified specimen was reported to have measured in length and weighed , more than two times heavier than the largest confirmed specimen at . Some other macropredatory sharks such as the Greenland shark (&quot;Somniosus microcephalus&quot;) and the Pacific sleeper shark (&quot;S. pacificus&quot;) are also reported to rival these sharks in length (but probably weigh a bit less since they are more slender in build than a great white) in exceptional cases.

==== Reported sizes ====
=== Adaptations ===

Great white sharks, like all other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the electromagnetic field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body&#x27;s lateral line.

To more successfully hunt fast and agile prey such as sea lions, the great white has adapted to maintain a body temperature warmer than the surrounding water. One of these adaptations is a &quot;rete mirabile&quot; (Latin for &quot;wonderful net&quot;). This close web-like structure of veins and arteries, located along each lateral side of the shark, conserves heat by warming the cooler arterial blood with the venous blood that has been warmed by the working muscles. This keeps certain parts of the body (particularly the stomach) at temperatures up to above that of the surrounding water, while the heart and gills remain at sea temperature. When conserving energy, the core body temperature can drop to match the surroundings. A great white shark&#x27;s success in raising its core temperature is an example of gigantothermy. Therefore, the great white shark can be considered an endothermic poikilotherm or mesotherm because its body temperature is not constant but is internally regulated. Great whites also rely on the fat and oils stored within their livers for long-distance migrations across nutrient-poor areas of the oceans. Studies by Stanford University and the Monterey Bay Aquarium published on 17 July 2013 revealed that in addition to controlling the sharks&#x27; buoyancy, the liver of great whites is essential in migration patterns. Sharks that sink faster during drift dives were revealed to use up their internal stores of energy quicker than those which sink in a dive at more leisurely rates.

Toxicity from heavy metals seems to have little negative effects on great white sharks. Blood samples taken from forty-three individuals of varying size, age and sex off the South African coast led by biologists from the University of Miami in 2012 indicates that despite high levels of mercury, lead, and arsenic, there was no sign of raised white blood cell count and granulate to lymphocyte ratios, indicating the sharks had healthy immune systems. This discovery suggests a previously unknown physiological defence against heavy metal poisoning. Great whites are known to have a propensity for &quot;self-healing and avoiding age-related ailments&quot;.

=== Bite force ===
A 2007 study from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, used CT scans of a shark&#x27;s skull and computer models to measure the shark&#x27;s maximum bite force. The study reveals the forces and behaviours its skull is adapted to handle and resolves competing theories about its feeding behaviour. In 2008, a team of scientists led by Stephen Wroe conducted an experiment to determine the great white shark&#x27;s jaw power and findings indicated that a specimen massing could exert a bite force of .

== Ecology and behaviour ==
This shark&#x27;s behaviour and social structure are complex. In South Africa, white sharks have a dominance hierarchy where an individual&#x27;s rank is primarily established by their size, and to a lesser extent, their sex and &quot;squatter&#x27;s rights&quot;; larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, females dominate males, and established residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat, although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance. Data acquired from animal-borne telemetry receivers and published in 2022 via the journal &quot;Royal Society Publishing&quot; suggests that individual great whites may associate so that they can inadvertently share information on the whereabouts of prey or the location of the remains of animals that can be scavenged. As biologging can help to reveal social habits, it allows a better understanding to be made in future studies regarding the full extent of social interactions in large marine animals, including the great white shark.

The great white shark is one of only a few sharks known to regularly lift its head above the sea surface to gaze at other objects such as prey. This is known as spy-hopping. This behaviour has also been seen in at least one group of blacktip reef sharks, but this might be learned from interaction with humans (it is theorized that the shark may also be able to smell better this way because smell travels through air faster than through water). White sharks are generally very curious animals, display intelligence and may also turn to socializing if the situation demands it. At Seal Island, white sharks have been observed arriving and departing in stable &quot;clans&quot; of two to six individuals on a yearly basis. Whether clan members are related is unknown, but they get along peacefully enough. In fact, the social structure of a clan is probably most aptly compared to that of a wolf pack, in that each member has a clearly established rank and each clan has an alpha leader. When members of different clans meet, they establish social rank nonviolently through any of a variety of interactions. In 2022, research in South Africa suggested that the great white shark has the ability to change colours to camouflage itself depending on the hormones it gives off. Different hormones would change the colour of the skin from white to grey. Skin dosed with adrenaline would turn lighter, with melanocyte-stimulating hormone causing melanocyte cells to dissipate thus making the shark&#x27;s skin a darker colour, although hormone mediated color change is not fully validated due to the limited number of test subjects (&quot;i.e.&quot; great whites). The camo shark hypothesis is supported by the fact that zebra sharks can change their colour as they age, and rainbow sharks can lose colour due to stress and ageing.

=== Diet ===
Great white sharks are generalist carnivores, preying upon fish (e.g. tuna, rays, other sharks), cetaceans (i.e., dolphins, porpoises, whales), pinnipeds (e.g. seals, fur seals, and sea lions), squid, sea turtles, sea otters (&quot;Enhydra lutris&quot;) and seabirds. Great whites have also been known to eat objects that they are unable to digest. Juvenile white sharks predominantly prey on fish, including other elasmobranchs, as their jaws are not strong enough to withstand the forces required to attack larger prey such as pinnipeds and cetaceans until they reach a length of or more, at which point their jaw cartilage mineralizes enough to withstand the impact of biting into larger prey species. Upon approaching a length of nearly , great white sharks begin to target predominantly marine mammals for food, though individual sharks seem to specialize in different types of prey depending on their preferences. They seem to be highly opportunistic. These sharks prefer prey with a high content of energy-rich fat. Shark expert Peter Klimley used a rod-and-reel rig and trolled carcasses of a seal, a pig, and a sheep from his boat in the South Farallons. The sharks attacked all three baits but rejected the sheep carcass.

Off Seal Island, False Bay in South Africa, the sharks ambush brown fur seals (&quot;Arctocephalus pusillus&quot;) from below at high speeds, hitting the seal mid-body. They achieve high speeds that allow them to completely breach the surface of the water. The peak burst speed is estimated to be above . They have also been observed chasing prey after a missed attack. Prey is usually attacked at the surface. Shark attacks occur most often in the morning, within two hours of sunrise, when visibility is poor. Their success rate is 55% in the first two hours, falling to 40% in late morning after which hunting stops.

Off California, sharks use different predation techniques depending on the prey species. They immobilize northern elephant seals (&quot;Mirounga angustirostris&quot;) with a large bite to the hindquarters (which is the main source of the seal&#x27;s mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between , and are potentially dangerous adversaries. However, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (&quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;) are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (&quot;Zalophus californianus&quot;) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.
In the Northwest Atlantic mature great whites are known to feed on both harbor and grey seals. Unlike adults, juvenile white sharks in the area feed on smaller fish species until they are large enough to prey on marine mammals such as seals.

White sharks also attack dolphins and porpoises from above, behind or below to avoid being detected by their echolocation. Targeted species include dusky dolphins (&quot;Sagmatias obscurus&quot;), Risso&#x27;s dolphins (&quot;Grampus griseus&quot;), bottlenose dolphins (&quot;Tursiops&quot; ssp.), humpback dolphins (&quot;Sousa&quot; ssp.), harbour porpoises (&quot;Phocoena phocoena&quot;), and Dall&#x27;s porpoises (&quot;Phocoenoides dalli&quot;). Groups of dolphins have occasionally been observed defending themselves from sharks with mobbing behaviour. White shark predation on other species of small cetacean has also been observed. In August 1989, a juvenile male pygmy sperm whale (&quot;Kogia breviceps&quot;) was found stranded in central California with a bite mark on its caudal peduncle from a great white shark. In addition, white sharks attack and prey upon beaked whales. Cases where an adult Stejneger&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Mesoplodon stejnegeri&quot;), with a mean mass of around , and a juvenile Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Ziphius cavirostris&quot;), an individual estimated at , were hunted and killed by great white sharks have also been observed. When hunting sea turtles, they appear to simply bite through the carapace around a flipper, immobilizing the turtle. The heaviest species of bony fish, the oceanic sunfish (&quot;Mola mola&quot;), has been found in great white shark stomachs.

Whale carcasses comprise an important part of the diet of white sharks. However, this has rarely been observed due to whales dying in remote areas. It has been estimated that of whale blubber could feed a white shark for 1.5 months. Detailed observations were made of four whale carcasses in False Bay between 2000 and 2010. Sharks were drawn to the carcass by chemical and odour detection, spread by strong winds. After initially feeding on the whale caudal peduncle and fluke, the sharks would investigate the carcass by slowly swimming around it and mouthing several parts before selecting a blubber-rich area. During feeding bouts of 15–20 seconds the sharks removed flesh with lateral headshakes, without the protective ocular rotation they employ when attacking live prey. The sharks were frequently observed regurgitating chunks of blubber and immediately returning to feed, possibly in order to replace low energy yield pieces with high energy yield pieces, using their teeth as mechanoreceptors to distinguish them. After feeding for several hours, the sharks appeared to become lethargic, no longer swimming to the surface; they were observed mouthing the carcass but apparently unable to bite hard enough to remove flesh, they would instead bounce off and slowly sink. Up to eight sharks were observed feeding simultaneously, bumping into each other without showing any signs of aggression; on one occasion a shark accidentally bit the head of a neighbouring shark, leaving two teeth embedded, but both continued to feed unperturbed. Smaller individuals hovered around the carcass eating chunks that drifted away. Unusually for the area, large numbers of sharks over five metres long were observed, suggesting that the largest sharks change their behaviour to search for whales as they lose the manoeuvrability required to hunt seals. The investigating team concluded that the importance of whale carcasses, particularly for the largest white sharks, has been underestimated.
In another documented incident, white sharks were observed scavenging on a whale carcass alongside tiger sharks. In 2020, marine biologists Sasha Dines and Enrico Gennari published a documented incident in the journal &quot;Marine and Freshwater Research&quot; of two great white sharks within an hour apart, successfully attacking and killing a live juvenile 7 m (23 ft) humpback whale. The sharks utilized the classic attack strategy used on pinnipeds when attacking the whale, even utilizing the bite-and-spit tactic they employ on smaller prey items. The whale was an entangled individual, heavily emaciated and thus more vulnerable to the sharks&#x27; attacks. The incident is the first known documentation of great whites actively killing a large baleen whale. A second incident regarding great white sharks killing humpback whales involving a single large female great white nicknamed Helen was documented off the coast of South Africa. Working alone, the shark attacked a emaciated and entangled humpback whale by attacking the whale&#x27;s tail to cripple it before she managed to drown the whale by biting onto its head and pulling it underwater. The attack was witnessed via aerial drone by marine biologist Ryan Johnson, who said the attack went on for roughly 50 minutes before the shark successfully killed the whale. Johnson suggested that the shark may have strategized its attack in order to kill such a large animal.

Stomach contents of great whites also indicates that whale sharks both juvenile and adult may also be included on the animal&#x27;s menu, though whether this is active hunting or scavenging is not known at present.

=== Reproduction ===
Great white sharks were previously thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33 years to reach sexual maturity. Maximum life span was originally believed to be more than 30 years, but a study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years. Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The shark&#x27;s late sexual maturity, low reproductive rate, long gestation period of 11 months and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental change.

Little is known about the great white shark&#x27;s mating habits, and mating behaviour had not been observed in this species until 1997 and properly documented in 2020. It was assumed previously to be possible that whale carcasses are an important location for sexually mature sharks to meet for mating. According to the testimony of fisherman Dick Ledgerwood, who observed two great white sharks mating in the area near Port Chalmers and Otago Harbor, in New Zealand, it is theorized that great white sharks mate in shallow water away from feeding areas and continually roll belly to belly during copulation. Birth has never been observed, but pregnant females have been examined. Great white sharks are ovoviviparous, which means eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth. The great white has an 11-month gestation period. The shark pup&#x27;s powerful jaws begin to develop in the first month. The unborn sharks participate in oophagy, in which they feed on ova produced by the mother. Delivery is in spring and summer. The largest number of pups recorded for this species is 14 pups from a single mother measuring that was killed incidentally off Taiwan in 2019.

On 9 July 2023, the first footage of what was likely a newborn great white shark was filmed via aerial drone off of Southern California, off Carpinteria, after a large adult shark was seen diving to the bottom roughly from the shoreline, after which the smaller shark rose to the surface. The young shark, estimated up to long, was pale in colour, possibly due to what may be an embryonic covering, possibly intrauterine milk, was seen sloughing off the skin of the young shark. Adult sharks filmed in the area days prior suggest the area may be a birthing ground for pregnant females. This footage was published in the journal &quot;Environmental Biology of Fishes&quot; on 29 January 2024. A follow-up study in published in October, 2024 lends further support to the theory that the Carpinteria shark was a newborn; The description and examination of neonate porbeagles with a similar body covering to the young great white suggests that the body covering is not intrauterine milk (which ceases in production mid-gestation), but is instead embryonic epithelium that covers the shark&#x27;s denticles and rubs off shortly after birth.

=== Breaching behaviour ===
A breach is the result of a high-speed approach to the surface with the resulting momentum taking the shark partially or completely clear of the water. This is a hunting technique employed by great white sharks whilst hunting seals. This technique is often used on cape fur seals at Seal Island in False Bay, South Africa. Because the behaviour is unpredictable, it is very hard to document. It was first photographed by Chris Fallows and Rob Lawrence who developed the technique of towing a slow-moving seal decoy to trick the sharks to breach. Between April and September, scientists may observe around 600 breaches. The seals swim on the surface and the great white sharks launch their predatory attack from the deeper water below. They can reach speeds of up to and can at times launch themselves more than into the air. Just under half of observed breach attacks are successful. In 2011, a 3-m-long shark jumped onto a seven-person research vessel off Seal Island in Mossel Bay. The crew were undertaking a population study using sardines as bait, and the incident was judged not to be an attack on the boat but an accident.

===Natural threats===
====Interspecific competition and predation by orcas====
Interspecific competition between the great white shark and the orca is probable in regions where dietary preferences of both species may overlap. An incident was documented on 4 October 1997, in the Farallon Islands off California in the United States. An estimated female orca immobilized an estimated great white shark. The orca held the shark upside down to induce tonic immobility and kept the shark still for fifteen minutes, causing it to suffocate. The orca then proceeded to eat the dead shark&#x27;s liver. It is believed that the scent of the slain shark&#x27;s carcass caused all the great whites in the region to flee, forfeiting an opportunity for a great seasonal feed. Another similar attack apparently occurred there in 2000, but its outcome is not clear. After both attacks, the local population of about 100 great whites vanished. Following the 2000 incident, a great white with a satellite tag was found to have immediately submerged to a depth of and swam to Hawaii.

In 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a great white shark off South Australia. In 2017, three great whites were found washed ashore near Gansbaai, South Africa, with their body cavities torn open and the livers removed by what is likely to have been orcas. Orcas also generally impact great white distribution. Studies published in 2019 of orca and great white shark distribution and interactions around the Farallon Islands indicate that the cetaceans impact the sharks negatively, with brief appearances by orcas causing the sharks to seek out new feeding areas until the next season. It is unclear whether this is an example of competitive exclusion or ecology of fear. Occasionally, however, some great whites have been seen to swim near orcas without fear.

====Parasites====
The great white shark is the definitive host of two species of tapeworms from the genus &quot;Clistobothrium&quot;, these being &quot;Clistobothrium carcharodoni&quot; and &quot;Clistobothrium tumidum&quot;, both of which infect the shark&#x27;s spiral intestine. The former is believed to be transmitted to great whites through the consumption of infected cetacean prey, namely the spinner dolphin (&quot;Stenella longirostris&quot;), Risso&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;Grampus griseus&quot;), and the common bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;), all of which serve as intermediary or paratenic hosts of the tapeworm. The latter species of tapeworm&#x27;s transmission vector is currently unknown, but it is unlikely to share the same intermediary hosts as &quot;Clisbotherium carcharodoni&quot;. The intensity of &quot;Clistobothrium carcharodoni&quot; infestations in affected great whites is extremely high; in one case, up to 2,533 specimens were recovered from the spiral valve of a single great white.

There are two recorded instances of the ectoparasitic cookiecutter shark &quot;(Isistius brasiliensis)&quot; targeting great whites off the coast of Guadalupe Island. However, the relative dearth of predation records indicates that great whites are not a common food source for cookiecutter sharks, and that cetaceans and pinnipeds - especially the Guadalupe fur seal (&quot;Arctocephalus townsendi&quot;) - are preferred over great whites; in part due to the higher caloric content of their blubber, and in part due to the higher risk of retaliation from victimized great whites.

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Shark bite incidents ===
Of all shark species, the great white shark is responsible for by far the largest number of recorded shark bite incidents on humans, with 351 documented unprovoked bite incidents on humans as of 2024.

More than any documented bite incident, Peter Benchley&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;Jaws&quot; and the subsequent 1975 film adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg provided the great white shark with the image of being a &quot;man-eater&quot; in the public mind. While great white sharks have killed humans in at least 74 documented unprovoked bite incidents, they typically do not target them: for example, in the Mediterranean Sea there have been 31 confirmed bite incidents against humans in the last two centuries, most of which were non-fatal. Many of the incidents seemed to be &quot;test-bites&quot;. Great white sharks also test-bite buoys, flotsam, and other unfamiliar objects, and they might grab a human or a surfboard to identify what it is.
Many bite incidents occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark&#x27;s senses. The species appears to not like the taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite whether or not the object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer seals, which are fat and rich in protein.

Studies published in 2021 by Ryan &quot;et al.&quot; in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface suggest that mistaken identity is in fact a case for many shark bite incidents perpetrated by great white sharks. Using cameras and footage of seals in aquariums as models and mounted cameras moving at the same speed and angle as a cruising great white shark looking up at the surface from below, the experiment suggests that the sharks are likely colorblind and cannot see in fine enough detail to determine whether the silhouette above them is a pinniped or a swimming human, potentially vindicating the hypothesis.

Humans are not appropriate prey because the shark&#x27;s digestion is too slow to cope with a human&#x27;s high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. , of the 351 recorded unprovoked attacks, 59 were fatal.

However, some researchers have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not that sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, chair of aquatic biology at the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dived solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans&#x27; ability to move out of reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white&#x27;s prey.

=== Shark culling ===

Shark culling is the deliberate killing of sharks by a government in an attempt to reduce shark attacks; shark culling is often called &quot;shark control&quot;. These programs have been criticized by environmentalists and scientists—they say these programs harm the marine ecosystem; they also say such programs are &quot;outdated, cruel, and ineffective&quot;. Many different species (dolphins, turtles, etc.) are also killed in these programs (because of their use of shark nets and drum lines)—15,135 marine animals were killed in New South Wales&#x27; nets between 1950 and 2008, and 84,000 marine animals were killed by Queensland authorities from 1962 to 2015.

Great white sharks are currently killed in both Queensland and New South Wales in &quot;shark control&quot; (shark culling) programs. Queensland uses shark nets and drum lines with baited hooks, while New South Wales only uses nets. From 1962 to 2018, Queensland authorities killed about 50,000 sharks, many of which were great whites. From 2013 to 2014 alone, 667 sharks were killed by Queensland authorities, including great white sharks. In Queensland, great white sharks found alive on the drum lines are shot. In New South Wales, between 1950 and 2008, a total of 577 great white sharks were killed in nets. Between September 2017 and April 2018, fourteen great white sharks were killed in New South Wales.

KwaZulu-Natal (an area of South Africa) also has a &quot;shark control&quot; program that kills great white sharks and other marine life. In a 30-year period, more than 33,000 sharks were killed in KwaZulu-Natal&#x27;s shark-killing program, including great whites.

In 2014 the state government of Western Australia led by Premier Colin Barnett implemented a policy of killing large sharks. The policy, colloquially referred to as the Western Australian shark cull, was intended to protect users of the marine environment from shark bite incidents, following the deaths of seven people on the Western Australian coastline in the years 2010–2013. Baited drum lines were deployed near popular beaches using hooks designed to catch great white sharks, as well as bull and tiger sharks. Large sharks found hooked but still alive were shot and their bodies discarded at sea. The government claimed they were not culling the sharks, but were using a &quot;targeted, localised, hazard mitigation strategy&quot;. Barnett described opposition as &quot;ludicrous&quot; and &quot;extreme&quot;, and said that nothing could change his mind. This policy was met with widespread condemnation from the scientific community, which showed that species responsible for bite incidents were notoriously hard to identify, that the drum lines failed to capture white sharks, as intended, and that the government also failed to show any correlation between their drum line policy and a decrease in shark bite incidents in the region.

=== Attacks on boats ===
Great white sharks infrequently bite and sometimes even sink boats. Only five of the 108 authenticated unprovoked shark bite incidents reported from the Pacific Coast during the 20th century involved kayakers. In a few cases they have bitten boats up to in length. They have bumped or knocked people overboard, usually biting the boat from the stern. In one case in 1936, a large shark leapt completely into the South African fishing boat &quot;Lucky Jim&quot;, knocking a crewman into the sea. Tricas and McCosker&#x27;s underwater observations suggest that sharks are attracted to boats by the electrical fields they generate, which are picked up by the ampullae of Lorenzini and confuse the shark about whether or not wounded prey might be nearby.

=== In captivity ===

Prior to August 1981, no great white shark in captivity lived longer than 11 days. In August 1981, a great white survived for 16 days at SeaWorld San Diego before being released. The idea of containing a live great white at SeaWorld Orlando was used in the 1983 film &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot;.

Monterey Bay Aquarium first attempted to display a great white in 1984, but the shark died after 11 days because it did not eat. In July 2003, Monterey researchers captured a small female and kept it in a large netted pen near Malibu for five days. They had the rare success of getting the shark to feed in captivity before its release. Not until September 2004 was the aquarium able to place a great white on long-term exhibit. A young female, which was caught off the coast of Ventura, was kept in the aquarium&#x27;s Outer Bay exhibit for 198 days before she was released in March 2005. She was tracked for 30 days after release. On the evening of 31 August 2006, the aquarium introduced a juvenile male caught outside Santa Monica Bay. His first meal as a captive was a large salmon steak on 8 September 2006, and as of that date, he was estimated to be in length and to weigh approximately . He was released on 16 January 2007, after 137 days in captivity.

Monterey Bay Aquarium housed a third great white, a juvenile male, for 162 days between 27 August 2007, and 5 February 2008. On arrival, he was long and weighed . He grew to and before release. A juvenile female came to the Outer Bay Exhibit on 27 August 2008. While she did swim well, the shark fed only once during her stay and was tagged and released on 7 September 2008. Another juvenile female was captured near Malibu on 12 August 2009, introduced to the Outer Bay exhibit on 26 August 2009, and was successfully released into the wild on 4 November 2009. The Monterey Bay Aquarium introduced a 1.4-m-long male into their redesigned &quot;Open Sea&quot; exhibit on 31 August 2011. He was exhibited for 55 days, and was released into the wild on 25 October the same year. However, the shark was determined to have died shortly after release via an attached electronic tag. The cause of death is not known.

The Monterey Bay Aquarium does not plan to exhibit any more great whites, as the main purpose of containing them was scientific. As data from captive great whites were no longer needed, the institute has instead shifted its focus to study wild sharks.

One of the largest adult great whites ever exhibited was at Japan&#x27;s Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium in 2016, where a male was exhibited for three days before dying. Perhaps the most famous captive was a female named Sandy, which in August 1980 became the only great white to be housed at the California Academy of Sciences&#x27; Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco, California. She was released because she would not eat and constantly bumped against the walls.

Due to the vast amounts of resources required and the subsequent cost to keep a great white shark alive in captivity, their dietary preferences, size, migratory nature, and the stress of capture and containment, permanent exhibition of a great white shark is likely to be unfeasible.

=== Shark tourism ===

Cage diving is most common at sites where great whites are frequent including the coast of South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia, and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at the focus of a booming tourist industry. A common practice is to chum the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.

At present, hang baits are illegal off Isla Guadalupe and reputable dive operators do not use them. Operators in South Africa and Australia continue to use hang baits and pinniped decoys. In South Australia, playing rock music recordings underwater, including the AC/DC album &quot;Back in Black&quot; has also been used experimentally to attract sharks.

Companies object to being blamed for shark bite incidents, pointing out that lightning tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans. Their position is that further research needs to be done before banning practices such as chumming, which may alter natural behaviour. One compromise is to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway, well away from human leisure areas. Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these responsible tourism.

== Conservation status ==
It is unclear how much of a concurrent increase in fishing for great white sharks has caused the decline of great white shark populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the great white shark is now considered vulnerable worldwide, and critically endangered in Europe and the Mediterranean. Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature notes that very little is known about the actual status of the great white shark, but as it appears uncommon compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered vulnerable. It is included in Appendix II of CITES, meaning that international trade in the species (including parts and derivatives) requires a permit. As of March 2010, it has also been included in Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks MoU, which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks. A February 2010 study by Barbara Block of Stanford University estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the tiger, whose population is in the same range. According to another study from 2014 by George H. Burgess, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, there are about 2,000 great white sharks near the California coast, which is 10 times higher than the previous estimate of 219 by Barbara Block.

Fishermen target many sharks for their jaws, teeth, and fins, and as game fish in general. The great white shark, however, is rarely an object of commercial fishing, although its flesh is considered valuable. If casually captured (it happens for example in some tonnare in the Mediterranean), it is misleadingly sold as &quot;smooth-hound shark&quot;.

=== In Australia ===
The great white shark was declared vulnerable by the Australian Government in 1999 because of significant population decline and is currently protected under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. The causes of decline prior to protection included mortality from sport fishing harvests as well as being caught in beach protection netting.

The national conservation status of the great white shark is reflected by all Australian states under their respective laws, granting the species full protection throughout Australia regardless of jurisdiction. Many states had prohibited the killing or possession of great white sharks prior to national legislation coming into effect. The great white shark is further listed as threatened in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, and as rare or likely to become extinct under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife Conservation Act in Western Australia.

In 2002, the Australian government created the White Shark Recovery Plan, implementing government-mandated conservation research and monitoring for conservation in addition to federal protection and stronger regulation of shark-related trade and tourism activities. An updated recovery plan was published in 2013 to review progress, research findings, and to implement further conservation actions. A study in 2012 revealed that Australia&#x27;s white shark population was separated by Bass Strait into genetically distinct eastern and western populations, indicating a need for the development of regional conservation strategies.

Presently, human-caused shark mortality is continuing, primarily from accidental and illegal catching in commercial and recreational fishing as well as from being caught in beach protection netting, and the populations of great white shark in Australia are yet to recover.

In spite of official protections in Australia, great white sharks continue to be killed in state &quot;shark control&quot; programs within Australia. For example, the government of Queensland has a &quot;shark control&quot; program (shark culling) which kills great white sharks (as well as other marine life) using shark nets and drum lines with baited hooks. In Queensland, great white sharks that are found alive on the baited hooks are shot. The government of New South Wales also kills great white sharks in its &quot;shark control&quot; program. Partly because of these programs, shark numbers in eastern Australia have decreased.

The Australasian population of great white sharks is believed to be in excess of 8,000–10,000 individuals according to genetic research studies done by CSIRO, with an adult population estimated to be around 2,210 individuals in both Eastern and Western Australia. The annual survival rate for juveniles in these two separate populations was estimated in the same study to be close to 73 per cent, while adult sharks had a 93 per cent annual survival rate. Whether or not mortality rates in great white sharks have declined, or the population has increased as a result of the protection of this species in Australian waters is as yet unknown due to the slow growth rates of this species.

=== In New Zealand ===
The great white shark is one of the most commonly found in the waters of New Zealand. As of April 2007, great white sharks were fully protected within of New Zealand and additionally from fishing by New Zealand-flagged boats outside this range. The maximum penalty is a $250,000 fine and up to six months in prison. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the great white shark under the New Zealand Threat Classification System as &quot;Nationally Endangered&quot;. The species meets the criteria for this classification as there exists a moderate, stable population of between 1000 and 5000 mature individuals. This classification has the qualifiers &quot;Data Poor&quot; and &quot;Threatened Overseas&quot;.

===In the United States===
====California====
In addition to existing federal regulations, great white sharks have been protected under California state law since January 1st, 1994. Under this law, catching, hunting, pursuit, capturing, and/or killing of great whites in California waters is strictly prohibited up to offshore, though exceptions exist for great whites caught for scientific research or unintentionally caught as bycatch. In both cases, a special permit is required in order to legally take them.

In 2013, great white sharks were added to California&#x27;s Endangered Species Act. From data collected, the population of great whites in the North Pacific was estimated to be fewer than 340 individuals. Research also reveals these sharks are genetically distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa, Australia, and the east coast of North America, having been isolated from other populations.

A 2014 study estimated the population of great white sharks along the California coastline to be approximately 2,400.

In September 2019, California governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 2109 into law, banning the use of shark bait, shark lures, and chumming to attract great whites in California waters, and prohibiting their usage within one nautical mile of any shoreline, pier, or jetty when a great white is visible or known to be present in the area.

====Massachusetts====
In June 2015, Massachusetts banned catching, cage diving, feeding, towing decoys, or baiting and chumming for its significant and highly predictable migratory great white population without an appropriate research permit. However, these restrictions apply to only activities within state waters, which extend three miles from shore. Therefore there are over a dozen tour operators offering cage diving and some do bait and/or chum.

<doc id="43620" wikidata="Q232151" url="?curid=43620" title="Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem">
<text>Melisende ( 1110 – 11 September 1161) was the queen of Jerusalem from 1131 to 1152. She was the first female ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the first woman to hold a public office in the crusader kingdom. She was already legendary in her lifetime for her generous support of the various Christian communities in her kingdom. Contemporary chronicler William of Tyre praised her wisdom and abilities, while modern historians differ in their assessment.

Melisende was the eldest daughter of King Baldwin II and Queen Morphia. In the late 1120s, when it became clear that her father would likely not have a son, she was declared heir presumptive to the throne and married Fulk of Anjou. Baldwin II died on 21 August 1131, having conferred the kingdom on Melisende, Fulk, and their son Baldwin III. Melisende and Fulk were crowned on 14 September.

Early in their joint reign, Fulk attempted to rule without Melisende. Barons led by Melisende&#x27;s kinsman Count Hugh II of Jaffa revolted, and although Hugh was defeated and exiled, Melisende grew powerful and terrorized the king and his supporters until he agreed to accord a share of the government to her. Once reconciled, they had another son, Amalric, and Fulk no longer made any decision in the kingdom without Melisende&#x27;s assent. During their joint rule, Melisende managed Church relations and patronage. Fulk died on 10 November 1143, and Melisende assumed full power. On 25 December, she was crowned together with their elder son, Baldwin III, who was still underage. Baldwin reached the age of majority in 1145, but Melisende steadfastly refused to cede any authority to him. Her reign saw two catastrophic Christian losses to the Muslims: the fall of Edessa in 1144 and the failed attempt, which she likely opposed, to take Damascus in 1148 during the Second Crusade.

Melisende&#x27;s relationship with Baldwin III collapsed in 1150 as she further reduced his role in state affairs. In early April 1152 it was decided in the High Court that the kingdom would be divided between mother and son. Within weeks, however, Baldwin invaded Melisende&#x27;s portion and besieged her in the Tower of David. In late April Melisende agreed to step down and retire to Nablus. She continued to involve herself in the affairs of her family, who also ruled the crusader states of Antioch and Tripoli. Although her influence in Jerusalem became limited, she counseled Baldwin and took a successful military initiative in his absence. Her patronage and involvement in ecclesiastical matters also continued. In 1161 she became incapacitated by an illness, possibly a stroke, and died on 11 September.

==Background==

The four crusader states of the Levant—the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Principality of Antioch, the County of Tripoli, and the County of Edessa—were created by the Franks, the Latin Christians who invaded the region and defeated its Muslim rulers during the First Crusade in 1098–99. Melisende was the eldest daughter of Baldwin of Bourcq, a Frankish crusader, and Morphia of Melitene, an Armenian noblewoman of the Greek Orthodox faith. The native Christians of the Levant were ethnically and doctrinally diverse, and included the adherents of the Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, Syriac Orthodox, Maronite, Coptic Orthodox, East Syriac, and Georgian Orthodox Churches. The historian Jaroslav Folda remarks that Melisende&#x27;s mixed heritage reflected the region&#x27;s ethnoreligious diversity.

Melisende&#x27;s parents probably married in 1100, according to the historian Bernard Hamilton; Folda dates Melisende&#x27;s birth to around 1110 or a little earlier. She and two of her sisters, Alice and Hodierna, were born while their father, also known as Baldwin II, was the count of Edessa. Folda thus believes that Melisende was born in Edessa. In 1118 Baldwin set out on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. During this journey the king of Jerusalem, Baldwin I, died. Baldwin II was elected to succeed him. In 1119 the new king returned to Edessa to install his cousin Joscelin of Courtenay as the new count and to bring his wife and their daughters to Jerusalem. Melisende gained another sister, Ioveta, after her parents were crowned king and queen in 1119.

The crusader states were in a near-constant state of war, and their defense fell to men. Baldwin II was the first Frankish ruler of Jerusalem to have children, yet all four of his children were daughters, and no conventions had yet developed in the crusader states regarding female succession. The marriage of Melisende&#x27;s parents was happy despite there being no male heir to the kingdom. Like Baldwin I&#x27;s wives Arda of Armenia and Adelaide del Vasto, Morphia took no part in the affairs of state.

==Heir to the kingdom==
Queen Morphia died on 1 October, probably in 1126 or 1127. Because he no longer expected to have a son, King Baldwin started providing for his daughters and settling his succession. Melisende, the eldest daughter, was to be his heir. Alice, the second eldest, was married to Prince Bohemond II of Antioch in 1126. Hodierna, the third daughter, may have already been betrothed to Raymond of Tripoli at this time. Ioveta, the youngest, was sent to the Convent of Saint Anne; the historian Hans E. Mayer believes that this was &quot;the safest way&quot; to ensure that her status as a (born to crowned parents) would not threaten Melisende&#x27;s claim.

In late 1127 or, less likely, early 1128, an embassy led by the prince of Galilee, William I of Bures, and the nobleman Guy I Brisebarre traveled to France to arrange a marriage for Melisende. After conferring with King Louis VI, the embassy arrived in early 1128 at the court of Count Fulk V of Anjou. Some historians, including Steven Runciman, have concluded that Fulk was selected by Louis. Mayer asserts that Fulk was chosen by an assembly held in the Kingdom of Jerusalem before the embassy departed, citing the 12th-century chronicler William of Tyre, and that the embassy only sought Louis&#x27;s consent, which was necessary because Fulk was Louis&#x27;s vassal. Fulk was already an experienced ruler. He had been to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage in 1120 and left a good impression by personally providing for a force of 100 knights for a year. His wife, Eremburga of Maine, had died in late 1126, and he already had grown children.
While the embassy was in Europe, Baldwin started associating Melisende with himself in official documents: in a charter from March 1129 she takes precedence as a witness over all the clergy, and in another, she again heads the list of witnesses and is explicitly called &quot;daughter of the king and heir of the kingdom&quot;. Mayer initially thought that Melisende had been declared heir before the embassy was sent to France, but eventually concluded that her official recognition was a condition imposed by Fulk before he would agree to a marriage contract and come to Jerusalem. Mayer argues that Fulk saw a useful precedent in the formal recognition of Empress Matilda, who married Fulk&#x27;s son Geoffrey Plantagenet in June 1128, as the heir presumptive to her father, King Henry I of England.

Having relinquished the counties of Anjou and Maine to his son Geoffrey, Fulk arrived in the Kingdom of Jerusalem with the embassy in May 1129. Their marriage was celebrated before 2 June. Runciman assumes that they married in Jerusalem, but Folda notes that it may as well have been in Acre and that most recent historians prefer not to speculate. King Baldwin bestowed upon them, as Melisende&#x27;s dowry, the cities of Acre and Tyre. These were the most lucrative parts of the royal domain and were to be held by the couple during the king&#x27;s lifetime. In the first half of 1130 Melisende gave birth to a son, Baldwin.

==Reign==
===Succession===

Prince Bohemond II of Antioch, husband of Melisende&#x27;s sister Alice, died in 1130. He and Alice had had only one child, Constance, who was aged two on Bohemond&#x27;s death. Alice attempted to seize power, but Baldwin marched to Antioch and prevented her. He left Count Joscelin I of Edessa in charge of the principality until a marriage could be arranged for Constance. The king fell seriously ill after returning. In August 1131 he had himself carried to the house of the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, wishing to die near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. There he summoned Melisende, Fulk, and their infant son, Baldwin, and proceeded to confer the kingdom on the three of them. King Baldwin II died on 21 August. Fulk and Melisende were crowned king and queen in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on 14 September, the Feast of the Cross. They were the first monarchs to be crowned in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

Joscelin died soon after Baldwin II, and Alice took the opportunity to again seize power in Antioch. Fulk invaded at the invitation of the Antiochene barons and installed a new government in the principality.

===Struggle with Fulk===
Early in her queenship, Melisende found herself deprived of the power she had possessed during her father&#x27;s lifetime. Fulk did not associate her in any of his public acts for the first five years of the new reign. He deliberately attempted to remove Melisende from power, which was in contravention of both their marriage contract and Baldwin II&#x27;s last will. Melisende&#x27;s exclusion from power was not just a matter of protocol: without a role in the government she could not grant appointments and land. In 1134, noblemen led by Melisende&#x27;s second cousin and vassal Count Hugh II of Jaffa revolted against Fulk. The reasons are not entirely clear. Hamilton agrees with Mayer&#x27;s conclusion that the conflict originated from Fulk&#x27;s replacement of the kingdom&#x27;s established nobility with newcomers from Anjou. According to Mayer, the noblemen may have expected to be protected by the queen from the king&#x27;s designs if they succeeded in restoring her to the place in government which her father had intended for her to have. The historian Malcolm Barber argues that Melisende must have been involved in the revolt, but concedes that her role is unknown.

William of Tyre recorded the rumor that the queen was having an illicit relationship with the &quot;young and very handsome&quot; Count Hugh, drawing the king&#x27;s ire. Hamilton and Mayer both discount the gossip. Mayer argues that William himself did not believe the rumor and that a medieval queen, being constantly attended by the members of her household and the court, would have found it exceedingly difficult to have a secret lover. Hamilton, on the other hand, argues that public opinion, spearheaded by the clergy, would have sided with Fulk and not, as it did, with Melisende if she had committed adultery. Mayer suspects that the rumors may have been spread by Fulk to both get rid of Hugh and to have Melisende locked up in a monastery, circumventing Baldwin II&#x27;s will.

Hugh&#x27;s stepson Walter I Grenier, lord of Caesarea, openly accused him of treason at court. Mayer suggests that Walter may have been incited to make this accusation. Hugh denied the charge and was challenged to a trial by combat, but did not appear. The king thus obtained a legal reason to confiscate Hugh&#x27;s County of Jaffa. Fulk laid siege to Jaffa, but the patriarch intervened and mediated peace: Hugh would cede Jaffa to the king and receive it back after spending three years in exile. Before he could leave for Europe, Hugh was stabbed in the street by a knight. After recovering he went into exile, where he died. The assassination attempt was widely suspected to have been ordered by King Fulk; though Fulk&#x27;s involvement was never proven, his reputation was severely damaged.

Melisende was incensed by Fulk&#x27;s treatment of Hugh and the slight on her honor. Fulk&#x27;s men did not dare appear in her presence. The queen directed most of her wrath at the viscount, Rohard the Elder, whom she held most responsible for influencing Fulk. Fulk even feared for his own life. Mayer suggests that for this reason, Fulk stayed in Antioch in 1135. The court was disrupted until third parties mediated a reconciliation between the king and queen. After persistent attempts, Fulk succeeded in obtaining Melisende&#x27;s pardon for Rohard and his other supporters, who were then able to appear at court again. From then on Fulk, in the words of William of Tyre, &quot;did not attempt to take the initiative, even in trivial matters, without her knowledge&quot;.

===Co-rule with Fulk===
====Family affairs====

After their reconciliation, Fulk never again issued a charter pertaining to the Kingdom of Jerusalem without Melisende&#x27;s consent. He did not seek Melisende&#x27;s consent where he did not have to, however. He based his regency for Melisende&#x27;s niece Constance of Antioch on the decision of the barons of the principality, and Melisende had no claim to it. According to Barber, maintaining hostilities with Fulk was not in Melisende&#x27;s interest after she was restored to power. He notes that Melisende needed to strengthen her succession, which had hitherto rested on only one son; and that she wished to influence Fulk&#x27;s policies in Antioch, where her sister Alice once again seized power. Melisende did successfully intercede with Fulk not to interfere with Alice&#x27;s actions. He returned from Antioch in late 1135, and the royal couple conceived another child. A son, Amalric, was born in 1136. He became Melisende&#x27;s favorite child.

A tangible result of Melisende and Fulk&#x27;s reconciliation is the luxurious Melisende Psalter. The psalter is a personal prayer book commissioned around 1135, and interpreted by Folda as part of Fulk&#x27;s energetic attempts to ingratiate himself with Melisende. It reflects the amalgamation of Western, Greek, and Armenian cultures in the crusader states. Folda argues that the psalter points to the recipient&#x27;s artistic taste, interests, and sensibilities as queen of a diverse population.

Melisende&#x27;s intervention did not guarantee Alice&#x27;s fortunes for long: she lost her regency in Antioch, this time permanently, when Raymond of Poitiers arrived to marry her still-underage daughter, Constance, in 1136. The queen was also determined to make provisions for her youngest sisters, Hodierna and Ioveta, who were children when their father died. Hodierna married the count of Tripoli, Raymond II, sometime before 1138. Barber believes that the union was arranged by Melisende in an attempt to link the ruling houses of all the crusader states. Ioveta, who had grown up in a convent, took vows as a nun 1134. According to William&#x27;s chronicle, Melisende judged that Ioveta was of too high birth to be a mere nun and decided that she should be made an abbess instead. Barber finds it difficult to tell how much Melisende was motivated by affection in her relationships with her sisters, particularly noting that &quot;there is no way of knowing&quot; whether Ioveta wished to live a monastic life or if Melisende induced her to negate the political threat which Ioveta may have represented as the sister born during their father&#x27;s kingship.





====Ecclesiastical relations====

Folda proposes that in the early 1130s, Melisende contributed to the renovation of the Convent of Saint Anne, where her sister Ioveta lived. The only narrative description of Melisende&#x27;s patronage, however, is that of the construction of a convent in Bethany, which was close enough to Jerusalem for the queen to maintain contact. In February 1138 she and Fulk persuaded the patriarch and the canons of the Holy Sepulchre to cede the church at Bethany and its dependent villages so that a new religious community could be built there. The Convent of Saint Lazarus, as it came to be known, was in construction for six years. Melisende so generously endowed the convent with estates, golden and silver sacred vessels with precious stones, silks, and ecclesiastical robes that she made it richer than any other monastery or church in the kingdom. Initially Melisende installed an elderly abbess. When the abbess died, Ioveta succeeded as Melisende intended, and Melisende sent further gifts, namely books, ornaments, and chalices. In the construction and endowment of Bethany&#x27;s convent Hamilton sees a &quot;spectacular&quot; example of Melisende&#x27;s power of patronage.

In 1138 the king and queen started associating their elder son, Baldwin, in their acts. Fulk continuously worked to secure the borders of the kingdom against the Fatimids of Egypt and the Turkish atabeg of Mosul, Zengi. Melisende, meanwhile, maintained a firm control over the Church. From the late 1130s she oversaw a further expansion of religious institutions, including the endowment of the Temple of the Lord with extensive land in Samaria, several grants of land to the Holy Sepulchre, and grants to the Abbey of Saint Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat, the Order of the Hospital, the leper hospital of Saint Lazarus, and the Premonstratensians of the Church of Saint Samuel at Mountjoy. Barber considers her responsible for the promotion of the Temple&#x27;s prior, Geoffrey, to abbot in 1137.

Melisende consistently supported the Syriac Church and ensured that they recovered the property which they had lost upon the Frankish conquest. She worked to improve relations with the Armenian Church as well; its leader, the catholicos, attended a synod of the Latin Church in Jerusalem in 1140. The Greek Orthodox Monastery of Saint Sabas also received an endowment from Melisende. Her lavish gifts became legendary and earned her a reputation as a devoutly religious woman, but Mayer argues that she was primarily a shrewd politician and that through her donations she was buying the Church&#x27;s political support.

===Sole rule===
====Accession and consolidation====

In late 1143 the court was at Acre, enjoying a period of peace. On 7 November Melisende expressed a wish to have a picnic. While they were riding in the countryside, Fulk galloped off in pursuit of a hare. His horse stumbled and threw him off, and the heavy saddle struck him on the head. He was carried unconscious to Acre, where he died on 10 November. Melisende made a public demonstration of grief and then proceeded to take full charge of the government. There was no royal election because the joint reign initiated in 1131 continued with Melisende and her son, Baldwin III.

Melisende, who had been consecrated, anointed, and crowned in 1131, underwent a second coronation on Christmas 1143, this time together with Baldwin III, who was also consecrated and anointed on this occasion. The rites were performed by the patriarch, William of Messines. All power was in Melisende&#x27;s hands; Baldwin was 13 at the time and Melisende became his guardian. The queen is commonly said to have acted as her son&#x27;s regent, but neither she nor the chronicler William of Tyre saw her rule as a regency. Citing William&#x27;s statement that royal power came to Melisende through hereditary right, Hamilton concludes that she was &quot;not a regent but the queen regnant&quot;. Baldwin started issuing charters in 1144 at the latest, when he issued one without reference to Melisende; henceforth all were issued jointly by the mother and son, leading Mayer to believe that Melisende forbade that any charters be issued in her son&#x27;s name only.

Melisende&#x27;s first action, as had been her husband&#x27;s or of any contemporary ruler, was to appoint supporters to the kingdom&#x27;s offices. As a woman, Melisende could not command the army. She appointed her first cousin Manasses of Hierges, who had recently arrived in the kingdom, to conduct military affairs in her name as constable. By choosing Manasses rather than empowering one of her subjects, Melisende ensured the preservation of royal authority. Besides Manasses, the queen&#x27;s inner circle comprised the lord of Nablus, Philip of Milly; the prince of Galilee, Elinand of Tiberias; and the viscount, Rohard the Elder. Philip&#x27;s family had been undermined early in Fulk&#x27;s reign, and Barber believes that this may explain Philip&#x27;s loyalty to Melisende. Elinand commanded more knights than any other lord in the kingdom. Rohard had incurred the queen&#x27;s wrath in the early 1130s by supporting her husband&#x27;s attempt to exclude her, but he was a key figure in the city of Jerusalem and, apparently, both were content to make peace. Through the support of Philip, Elinand, and Rohard, Melisende controlled Jerusalem and the regions of Samaria and Galilee, all of which contained parts of the royal domain.

====Church management====

After Melisende and Baldwin III were crowned, work started on enlarging the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Folda argues that the project saw copious support from Queen Melisende and her cooperation with Patriarch Fulcher. The historian Nurith Kenaan-Kedar credits the Armenian characteristics of the Cathedral of Saint James in Jerusalem to Melisende&#x27;s support and influence.

Melisende received a letter of encouragement from the famed monk Bernard of Clairvaux in 1144 or 1145, but in his next letter to the queen Bernard mentioned hearing &quot;certain evil reports&quot; of her. Barber suggests that the &quot;evil reports&quot; might be the claim of an anonymous Premonstratensian monk from France, who wrote that in 1148 Melisende had poisoned Count Alfonso Jordan of Toulouse and arranged for the capture of his son Bertrand by the Muslims. The monk wrote that the queen did this to ensure that Alfonso Jordan, a relative of the counts of Tripoli, would not threaten the possession of Tripoli by her brother-in-law Raymond and sister Hodierna. Melisende was on good terms with the Premonstratensians, however, and Barber attributes the monk&#x27;s hostility to the &quot;endemic misogyny of the monastic world&quot;.

In filling the offices with trusted men Melisende had her eye on the chancery too. She had no desire to retain Elias, who had been her husband&#x27;s confidant, so she arranged for him to become bishop of Tiberias, a promotion he could not have refused. In 1145 Melisende appointed Ralph, another newcomer, to succeed Elias as chancellor. In January 1146 the archbishop of Tyre, Fulcher of Angoulême, was elected to the patriarchate, succeeding William of Messines, who had died in September 1145. Melisende insisted that Ralph be appointed to the vacated see of Tyre. Barber holds that Fulcher must have risen to the patriarchate with Melisende&#x27;s support, yet he led the opposition to her choice of Ralph. The conflict over the see of Tyre marked the only time Melisende was at odds with the Church.

====Holy war====
Immediately after his coronation Baldwin III sought to assert himself in warfare, the one field in which he had the advantage over his mother, and in 1144 he quelled a revolt at Wadi Musa. The queen and the constable faced their first crisis already in November when Zengi of Mosul besieged Edessa. The Edessenes appealed to the young king for help, but it was Melisende who made the decisions. She called a council, and it was decided that Manasses, Philip, and Elinand should lead a relief force. Mayer believes that the young king was not sent because Melisende resented his success at Wadi Musa; he argues that the queen did not wish to see her son gain a reputation as a military leader lest it lead to him becoming a threat to her political leadership. Barber suggests that Melisende did not send Baldwin because she thought that the gravity of the situation required experienced adults. In any case, the army did not reach Edessa in time: the city fell to the Turks, who spared its Armenian and Greek population, but &quot;killed the Franks wherever they could&quot; according to the chronicler Michael the Syrian. Immediately upon receiving the news Melisende contacted Antioch about sending an embassy to break the news to the pope and to request a new crusade. Baldwin III came of age on his fifteenth birthday in early 1145, but the occasion was not publicly celebrated.

Zengi was assassinated in September 1146. Count Joscelin II of Edessa attempted to retake his former city, and King Baldwin invaded the Hauran, but both were defeated by Zengi&#x27;s son Nur al-Din. Mayer is certain that Melisende blamed Baldwin for the failure to take the Hauran, saying that it may explain how Melisende was able to reduce Baldwin&#x27;s position by associating her younger son, Amalric, in a subsequent charter. The inclusion of Amalric was, in Mayer&#x27;s words, &quot;an application of the principle &quot;divide et impera&quot;&quot;, and served to increase Melisende&#x27;s power at Baldwin&#x27;s expense.

The news of the fall of Edessa shocked Europe, and Pope Eugene III began calling for a crusade. Kings Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany travelled to the Levant with their relatives, vassals, and troops, accompanied by papal legates. The crusaders were met near Acre on 24 June 1148 by a contingent from Jerusalem consisting of Queen Melisende, King Baldwin, Patriarch Fulcher, the archbishops and the bishops, the masters of the Knights Hospitaller and Templar, and the leading noblemen; it was the most impressive gathering of dignitaries ever held in the Latin East. A decision to attack Damascus had already been reached in April by Baldwin, Conrad, and Fulcher in a much smaller meeting, which Melisende apparently did not attend. Damascus was a great Muslim-held city, and its capture would have served Jerusalem better than capturing distant Edessa. The patriarch usually took Melisende&#x27;s side over Baldwin&#x27;s and would have advocated her opinion, but right at this time the two were at odds over the appointment of her chancellor, Ralph, to the see of Tyre. Mayer surmises, while admitting that it cannot be known for certain, that Melisende must have been opposed to the decision to attack Damascus because it had so far been a valuable ally against Nur al-Din and because the conquest of such a great city would have earned Baldwin enough prestige to challenge her supremacy.

During the ensuing siege of Damascus the crusaders were falsely advised by certain persons who had been bribed to betray them, leading to a swift and humiliating defeat. Mayer considered the possibility that Melisende first supported the expedition only to then engineer its failure in a bid to destroy Baldwin&#x27;s military and political reputation, noting that it would have been a politically reckless game. The outcome was a major setback for Baldwin, but he was not completely crushed. In 1149, after the death of Prince Raymond in another disastrous defeat of the Christians by Nur al-Din, Baldwin hastened to assume responsibility for Antioch. Melisende used her son&#x27;s failure at Damascus, and possibly his journey to Antioch, to further reduce his position: from 1149 she no longer issued charters jointly with him, but merely allowed him to consent.

====Rupture with Baldwin III====

The dispute with the Church over the appointment of her chancellor, Ralph, to the see of Tyre reached its peak by 1149 and became a serious issue for Melisende as rift grew between her and Baldwin. To retain the Church as an ally she either dismissed Ralph from the chancery or forced him to resign. She could not appoint a new chancellor without her co-ruler&#x27;s consent, however, and the chancery thus collapsed. Mother and son henceforth employed separate scribes, which avoided an open break in their co-reign, but marked an unprecedented division of royal power.

The death of her trusted and most important vassal Elinand, prince of Galilee, 1149 was a setback for Melisende. After the capture of the count of Edessa in 1150, Baldwin summoned the lords to march with him to Antioch, but those loyal to Melisende refused. This was, in Mayer&#x27;s mind, the queen&#x27;s attempt to prevent Baldwin from making any military success, and specifically from fulfilling the traditional role of the kings of Jerusalem in protecting the northern crusader states. Baldwin went anyway with the small force he could muster.

Mayer considers it clear from the surviving charters that from 1150 Melisende was preparing for a showdown with Baldwin: she set up her own administrative machinery and gathered the lords loyal to her. In 1150 she procured for her cousin and constable, Manasses, the hand of Helvis of Ramla, widow of her supporter Barisan of Ibelin. This angered Barisan&#x27;s sons, Hugh, Baldwin, and Balian, because it led to them losing land in Ramla. Baldwin, for his part, held Manasses responsible for his estrangement from his mother. Melisende further consolidated her position against Baldwin in 1151 when she made her younger son, Amalric, count of Jaffa. He became her most important partisan besides the Church.

====Civil war====
Baldwin began to move in early 1152. He demanded that the patriarch crown him on Easter without crowning Melisende, which would signify that Baldwin would from then on be the sole ruler. Patriarch Fulcher refused, for the Church supported Melisende. On Easter Monday Baldwin staged a solemn procession through Jerusalem, the seat of Melisende&#x27;s power, wearing a laurel wreath instead of a crown. He then summoned the High Court and requested a division of the kingdom between him and his mother. For Hamilton, this request was &quot;criminally irresponsible&quot; because the kingdom was too small to survive a division; yet Mayer argues that Melisende had &quot;de facto&quot; divided the kingdom over the previous two years. At the meeting Melisende argued that the entire kingdom belonged to her by hereditary right, implying that Baldwin was the one usurping her right, but agreed to the division. The queen retained the regions of Judaea and Samaria while Baldwin held Acre and Tyre.

The division of the kingdom was short-lived. Baldwin declared that the land he had been allocated was insufficient to financially support him as king. Realizing her son&#x27;s intentions, Melisende moved from the unfortified town of Nablus to Jerusalem. Baldwin defeated Manasses at Mirabel and exiled him, then swiftly occupied Nablus, and moved with his force onto Jerusalem. Some of the lords in Melisende&#x27;s portion deserted her; those who remained loyal until the end included her son Amalric, Philip of Milly, and Rohard the Elder. Upon hearing of her elder son&#x27;s advance, Melisende withdrew with her household and followers to the citadel in the Tower of David. Patriarch Fulcher at this point declared the Church&#x27;s full support for the queen. He marched out with his clergy to admonish the king, only to return enraged after Baldwin rebuffed him. The king set up camp outside the city, after which the citizens opened the gates to him. He then proceeded to bombard the Tower with siege engines, but could not make progress because the besieged defended themselves valiantly.

Despite being strongly fortified and well stocked, the Tower could not resist indefinitely, and so Melisende stood no chance of winning. After several days a settlement was negotiated, possibly by churchmen. Melisende might have been expected to retire to the convent of Bethany, but Hamilton posits that she held out for better terms, which saw her gain Nablus and adjacent lands for life along with her son&#x27;s promise not to disturb her. Nablus would provide a substantial income but, being unfortified, could not be turned into a centre of military power. In these terms Hamilton sees evidence that, although she lost the war, Melisende retained powerful allies. Mayer argues that Melisende agreed to abstain from politics, to rule Nablus not as queen but as any city lord would, and to act only with the king&#x27;s consent. The eight-year-long struggle between mother and son was thus over by 20 April 1152–as was Melisende&#x27;s sixteen-year-long authority.

==Retirement==
Melisende&#x27;s initiative did not cease in her retirement. Baldwin summoned a general assembly of the crusader states at Tripoli in mid-1152 intending to induce his widowed cousin Constance, princess of Antioch, to remarry and so relieve him of the responsibility for the principality. The attendees included the princess and her vassals and clergy as well as the count and countess of Tripoli. Though she was apparently neither summoned nor invited, Melisende also participated. Ostensibly she was there to help settle the marital problems of her sister Countess Hodierna and brother-in-law Count Raymond of Tripoli. Hamilton considers this a clever move because she could not be prevented from paying a visit to her sister, and once in Tripoli had to be invited to discuss her niece&#x27;s marriage. Neither goal was achieved. The sisters set out for Jerusalem, and were escorted for a while by Hodierna&#x27;s husband. As he was returning to Tripoli, he was killed by Assassins. The sisters returned to Tripoli for the funeral, after which Baldwin escorted Melisende home. Hodierna assumed rule over Tripoli as regent for her young son, Raymond III. Hamilton believes that from then on Baldwin&#x27;s control over Antioch and Tripoli, ruled by Melisende&#x27;s niece and sister respectively, depended on him treating his mother with respect.

Mayer presumes that in the aftermath of their conflict, Melisende and Baldwin hated each other intensely, yet took care to appear as a happy family. The mother made certain to mention her son&#x27;s consent in all her acts, and the son honored her in return and allowed her to advise him. By sparing her public humiliation, Baldwin avoided goading her into challenging him. In 1153 he conquered Ascalon, proving himself as a military leader, and made peace with Melisende. He distributed the lands around Ascalon following her advice. From 1154 Melisende was associated in her son&#x27;s public acts and he confirmed the grants she had made during their estrangement. Most of these were merely a matter of courtesy according to Mayer, but he did on occasion genuinely seek her counsel. From 1156 the queen regained a measure of political influence, taking part in Baldwin&#x27;s negotiation of a treaty with the Republic of Pisa in November. In 1157 she took a military initiative while the king was in Antioch: it is thanks to her insistence that the cave-fortress of el-Hablis, significant for controlling the territory of Gilead beyond the River Jordan, was attacked and recovered from the Muslims.

Melisende maintained her interest in the matters of religion. Barber believes that she continued her patronage of the Church as before her retirement. In 1157 Amalric married Agnes, daughter of the dispossessed Count Joscelin II of Edessa. Patriarch Fulcher protested that Amalric and Agnes were related within the prohibited degrees, but despite her piety Melisende did not object. The same year her stepdaughter Countess Sibylla of Flanders, Fulk&#x27;s daughter from his first marriage, arrived in Jerusalem on a pilgrimage and entered the convent of Bethany. Fulcher died on 20 November, and though clergy assembled to elect his successor, Melisende intervened with Sibylla and Hodierna to secure the appointment of Amalric of Nesle as the next patriarch. The following year Baldwin married too; his wife, Theodora Komnene, became the new queen. Hamilton speculates that Melisende&#x27;s forceful character made her sons reluctant to allow their wives to take part in state affairs. In 1160 Queen Melisende joined her sister Hodierna in commissioning luxurious jewelry, gold tiaras, and silver utensils for the dowry of Hodierna&#x27;s daughter, Melisende of Tripoli; this example of Melisende&#x27;s art patronage demonstrates, in Folda&#x27;s opinion, the queen&#x27;s continued activity and the Franks&#x27; resolve to impress her niece&#x27;s betrothed, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. 

Queen Melisende&#x27;s last public act was to assent with King Baldwin to Count Amalric&#x27;s donation to the Holy Sepulchre on 30 November 1160. In 1161 she fell ill, with her memory impaired; she may have had a stroke. Hodierna and Ioveta nursed her for several months, permitting few people to see her. In the last weeks of her life Baldwin moved into Nablus, acquiring the land Philip of Milly held there. This was in breach of his agreement with his mother, but she was by then unaware of the outside world. She died on 11 September 1161. Barber estimates that she was probably in her early fifties. William of Tyre records that Baldwin was inconsolable; Mayer calls this &quot;a fine public show of grief&quot;. Melisende was buried, like her mother, in the Abbey of Saint Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat, which had always been dear to her. Folda considers her tomb to have been her last major commission in Jerusalem and &quot;more magnificent than any king of Jerusalem ever received&quot;. In her last will and testament she left property to, among others, the Orthodox Monastery of Saint Sabas. Baldwin barely outlived her, dying on 10 February 1163.

==Assessment==
The chief source of information about Queen Melisende&#x27;s life is Archbishop William of Tyre. He was only born in 1130, however, and from the death of Fulcher of Chartres in 1127 there was no resident chronicler in the crusader states. William was studying in Europe from 1145 to 1165 and only started writing his &quot;History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea&quot; in 1167. The late reign of Baldwin II and the reigns of Fulk and Melisende are therefore poorly documented and, as noted by Barber, &quot;subject of much speculative argument among historians&quot;.

When recounting the conflict between Melisende and her son Baldwin III, William takes the queen&#x27;s side. Mayer explains that William was the court historian to King Amalric, the son who had sided with the queen and succeeded Baldwin III, and that William was influenced by Melisende&#x27;s lavish grants to the Church. William wrote:
Barber notes that while William&#x27;s description of Melisende as &quot;wise and judicious beyond what is normal for a woman&quot; may sound patronizing to a modern reader, it is particularly significant because the archbishop did not normally approve of the involvement of women in public affairs.

Hamilton agrees with William&#x27;s judgment that &quot;striving to emulate the glory of the best princes... she ruled the kingdom with such ability that she was rightly considered to have equaled her predecessors in that regard&quot;. For Hamilton, Melisende was &quot;a truly remarkable woman&quot; because for decades she exercised power in a kingdom where no woman had previously had a public role. Barber observes that William&#x27;s opinion was not universally shared and that two of the greatest disasters suffered by the Franks in the Levant took place during her reign, namely the fall of Edessa in 1144 and the failure to conquer Damascus in 1148, though he concedes that the extent of Melisende&#x27;s responsibility cannot be determined. Barber contrasts this poor record with Baldwin III&#x27;s conquest of Ascalon the year after she was deposed. Hamilton concludes that Melisende was both cultured and devout, while Folda calls her the greatest art patron in the 12th-century Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Mayer criticizes Melisende for not voluntarily abdicating in favor of Baldwin III, declaring that &quot;her thirst for power was greater than her wisdom&quot;. He insists that &quot;in spite of all the praise William of Tyre heaps on Melisende&#x27;s abilities&quot;, her son was better suited to rule. Hamilton does not see why she should have felt the need to resign power to her &quot;inexperienced&quot; son, arguing that she was not a regent but the recognized co-ruler who governed well and enjoyed broad support. Mayer concludes that Melisende was &quot;one of the most energetic among mediaeval queens&quot;.

<doc id="43649" wikidata="Q2924131" url="?curid=43649" title="Brave Combo">
<text>Brave Combo is a polka fusion band based in Denton, Texas. Founded in 1979 by guitarist/keyboardist/accordionist Carl Finch, they have been a prominent fixture in the Texas music scene for more than thirty-five years. Their music, both originals and covers, incorporates a number of dance styles, mostly polka, but also some Latin American and Caribbean styles like norteño, salsa, rumba, cha-cha-cha, choro, samba, two-step, cumbia, charanga, merengue, ska, etc, all performed with a rock/worldbeat energy.

As part of their perceived artistic mission to expand the musical tastes of their listeners, they have often played and recorded covers of well-known songs in a style radically different from the original versions. Examples include polka versions of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Purple Haze&quot; and The Doors&#x27; &quot;People are Strange&quot;, The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; as a cha-cha, and &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; as a cumbia.

==History and influences==
In a 1995 feature in &quot;The Santa Fe New Mexican&quot;, band cofounder Carl Finch described Brave Combo&#x27;s influence as a polka band with rock styles as an earnest way to escape an increasingly corporate cultural landscape, lamenting-
&#x27;Rock had been removed from the common people&#x27; he said &#x27;and musically I wanted what I do to have depth, I started listening to polka and ethnic records I&#x27;d find at Target six for $5 — nothing could beat that. At first, I’d just buy whatever covers looked strangest but after a while I’d do research and find out what was good.&#x27; Among the best, he soon discovered, were names like Larry Chesky and his big band polka sound, Norwegian accordion virtuoso Andrew Walter (“exciting intense” is Finch’s assessment), and Eddie Blazonczyk, the “Godfather” of Chicago’s Polish community. &#x27;All this came out of a sense of desperation&#x27;.
Brave Combo had its website at brave.com/bo, a domain hack. The domain name brave.com was purchased in 1995 by a fan of the band, who transferred it to the band in 1997. In mid-2010s, Finch sold the domain to Brave Software, which develops the web browser Brave, in exchange for bravecombo.com, which had been taken by a squatter, and an undisclosed sum of money.

==Awards and honors==
They won a Grammy Award in 1999 in the Best Polka Album category for their album &quot;Polkasonic&quot;, and again in 2004 for their album &quot;Let&#x27;s Kiss&quot;.

In naming Denton, Texas, the &quot;Best Music Scene&quot; for 2008, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine cited Brave Combo as the &quot;Grand Pooh-Bah of Denton bands&quot; and said that &quot;Brave Combo, is in many ways the template from which all the rest are cut: eclectic and artistically ambitious, with a high degree of musicianship and a strong DIY ethic.&quot;

==Media appearances==
*The band made a short appearance, as animated figures, on the March 21, 2004, episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;Co-Dependents&#x27; Day&quot;). Series creator Matt Groening is a fan of the band and they appeared on the show at his personal request. In the episode, the band played a new original song called &quot;Fill The Stein&quot; and their version of &quot;The Simpsons Theme&quot; played over the closing credits.
*Finch and other band members made cameo appearances in Talking Heads leader David Byrne&#x27;s 1986 movie &quot;True Stories&quot;, set in fictional Virgil, Texas. Finch can be spotted in the fashion show sporting a brick-patterned suit and in the parade leading the all-accordion marching band. (In real life, Brave Combo was David Byrne&#x27;s wedding band.)
*They appear in the 1986 Hank Wangford Channel 4 television series &quot;The A to Z of C &amp; W&quot; singing the Hank Williams song &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot;.
*They contributed two songs to the &quot;Gumby&quot; album, released in 1989.
*Their song &quot;Busy Office Rhumba&quot; was used as the theme for the 1993 Fox television series &quot;Bakersfield P.D.&quot;
*They appear as a wedding band in the 1995 feature film &quot;Late Bloomers&quot;.
*In 2000, they appeared on the national telecast of the &quot;MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot; with Jerry Lewis dancing along to the music.
*They wrote and performed the theme song for the 2005 series &quot;ESPN Bowling Night&quot;.
*The opening theme and other music for the 2008 PBS animated series &quot;Click and Clack&#x27;s As the Wrench Turns&quot; were produced by Carl Finch and composed, arranged, and performed by Finch and Brave Combo.
*Their live music video, &quot;The Denton Polka&quot;, appears on the &quot;Bohemia Rising DVD Compilation&quot; (released in 2009), a collection of documentary shorts directed by Christopher Largen exploring rebellion and resistance to corporate demolition in their hometown of Denton, Texas.
*Included in Bob Dylan&#x27;s 2009 Christmas release, &quot;Christmas In The Heart&quot;, the song &quot;Must Be Santa&quot;, is performed polka-style. Dylan&#x27;s arrangement is almost identical to the Brave Combo arrangement from their 1991 CD &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas, Man!&quot;. In an interview published by Street News Service, Dylan acknowledged the influence of Brave Combo: &quot;This version comes from a band called Brave Combo. Somebody sent their record to us for our radio show. They’re a regional band out of Texas that takes regular songs and changes the way you think about them. You oughta hear their version of &#x27;Hey Jude&#x27;.&quot;
*They were featured on Bowling for Soup&#x27;s album &quot;Sorry for Partyin&#x27;&quot;, playing a polka version of Bowling For Soup&#x27;s song &quot;Belgium&quot;. 
*The season seven episode &quot;Fun on a Bun&quot; of the animated science fiction comedy &quot;Futurama&quot; includes two original songs by the band plus a cover version of &quot;The Chicken Dance&quot;. The episode debuted August 1, 2012, on Comedy Central.
*The season ten episode &quot;Bar Wars V: The Final Judgment&quot; of the NBC sitcom comedy &quot;Cheers&quot; features Sam’s rival Gary pranking the bar on Halloween by rigging Cheers’ jukebox, telephone and even the bar’s soda gun to play the Combo song ‘Vampire Twist’ when being used.

<text>Spamdexing (also known as search engine spam, search engine poisoning, [[Black hat hacker|black-hat]] [[search engine optimization]], search spam or web spam) is the deliberate manipulation of search engine indexes. It involves a number of methods, such as link building and repeating related and/or unrelated phrases, to manipulate the relevance or prominence of resources indexed in a manner inconsistent with the purpose of the indexing system.

Spamdexing could be considered to be a part of search engine optimization, although there are many SEO methods that improve the quality and appearance of the content of web sites and serve content useful to many users.

==Overview==
Search engines use a variety of algorithms to determine relevancy ranking. Some of these include determining whether the search term appears in the body text or URL of a web page. Many search engines check for instances of spamdexing and will remove suspect pages from their indexes. Also, search-engine operators can quickly block the results listing from entire websites that use spamdexing, perhaps in response to user complaints of false matches. The rise of spamdexing in the mid-1990s made the leading search engines of the time less useful. Using unethical methods to make websites rank higher in search engine results than they otherwise would is commonly referred to in the SEO (search engine optimization) industry as &quot;black-hat SEO&quot;. These methods are more focused on breaking the search-engine-promotion rules and guidelines. In addition to this, the perpetrators run the risk of their websites being severely penalized by the Google Panda and Google Penguin search-results ranking algorithms.

Common spamdexing techniques can be classified into two broad classes: &quot;content spam&quot; (&quot;term spam&quot;) and &quot;link spam&quot;.

==History==
The earliest known reference to the term &quot;spamdexing&quot; is by Eric Convey in his article &quot;Porn sneaks way back on Web&quot;, &quot;The Boston Herald&quot;, May 22, 1996, where he said:

The problem arises when site operators load their Web pages with hundreds of extraneous terms so search engines will list them among legitimate addresses.
The process is called &quot;spamdexing,&quot; a combination of spamming—the Internet term for sending users unsolicited information—and &quot;indexing.&quot;

Keyword stuffing had been used in the past to obtain top search engine rankings and visibility for particular phrases. This method is outdated and adds no value to rankings today. In particular, Google no longer gives good rankings to pages employing this technique.

Hiding text from the visitor is done in many different ways. Text colored to blend with the background, CSS &quot;z-index&quot; positioning to place text underneath an image — and therefore out of view of the visitor — and CSS absolute positioning to have the text positioned far from the page center are all common techniques. By 2005, many invisible text techniques were easily detected by major search engines.

&quot;Noscript&quot; tags are another way to place hidden content within a page. While they are a valid optimization method for displaying an alternative representation of scripted content, they may be abused, since search engines may index content that is invisible to most visitors.

Sometimes inserted text includes words that are frequently searched (such as &quot;sex&quot;), even if those terms bear little connection to the content of a page, in order to attract traffic to advert-driven pages.

In the past, keyword stuffing was considered to be either a white hat or a black hat tactic, depending on the context of the technique, and the opinion of the person judging it. While a great deal of keyword stuffing was employed to aid in spamdexing, which is of little benefit to the user, keyword stuffing in certain circumstances was not intended to skew results in a deceptive manner. Whether the term carries a pejorative or neutral connotation is dependent on whether the practice is used to pollute the results with pages of little relevance, or to direct traffic to a page of relevance that would have otherwise been de-emphasized due to the search engine&#x27;s inability to interpret and understand related ideas. This is no longer the case. Search engines now employ themed, related keyword techniques to interpret the intent of the content on a page.

==Content spam==
These techniques involve altering the logical view that a search engine has over the page&#x27;s contents. They all aim at variants of the vector space model for information retrieval on text collections.

===Keyword stuffing===
Keyword stuffing is a search engine optimization (SEO) technique in which keywords are loaded into a web page&#x27;s meta tags, visible content, or backlink anchor text in an attempt to gain an unfair rank advantage in search engines. Keyword stuffing may lead to a website being temporarily or permanently banned or penalized on major search engines. The repetition of words in meta tags may explain why many search engines no longer use these tags. Nowadays, search engines focus more on the content that is unique, comprehensive, relevant, and helpful that overall makes the quality better which makes keyword stuffing useless, but it is still practiced by many webmasters.

Many major search engines have implemented algorithms that recognize keyword stuffing, and reduce or eliminate any unfair search advantage that the tactic may have been intended to gain, and oftentimes they will also penalize, demote or remove websites from their indexes that implement keyword stuffing.

Changes and algorithms specifically intended to penalize or ban sites using keyword stuffing include the Google Florida update (November 2003) Google Panda (February 2011) Google Hummingbird (August 2013) and Bing&#x27;s September 2014 update.

Headlines in online news sites are increasingly packed with just the search-friendly keywords that identify the story. Traditional reporters and editors frown on the practice, but it is effective in optimizing news stories for search.

=== Hidden or invisible text ===
Unrelated hidden text is disguised by making it the same color as the background, using a tiny font size, or hiding it within HTML code such as &quot;no frame&quot; sections, alt attributes, zero-sized DIVs, and &quot;no script&quot; sections. People manually screening red-flagged websites for a search-engine company might temporarily or permanently block an entire website for having invisible text on some of its pages. However, hidden text is not always spamdexing: it can also be used to enhance accessibility.

===Meta-tag stuffing===
This involves repeating keywords in the meta tags, and using meta keywords that are unrelated to the site&#x27;s content. This tactic has been ineffective. Google declared that it doesn&#x27;t use the keywords meta tag in its online search ranking in September 2009.

===Doorway pages===
&quot;Gateway&quot; or doorway pages are low-quality web pages created with very little content, which are instead stuffed with very similar keywords and phrases. They are designed to rank highly within the search results, but serve no purpose to visitors looking for information. A doorway page will generally have &quot;click here to enter&quot; on the page; autoforwarding can also be used for this purpose. In 2006, Google ousted vehicle manufacturer BMW for using &quot;doorway pages&quot; to the company&#x27;s German site, BMW.de.

===Scraper sites===
Scraper sites are created using various programs designed to &quot;scrape&quot; search-engine results pages or other sources of content and create &quot;content&quot; for a website. The specific presentation of content on these sites is unique, but is merely an amalgamation of content taken from other sources, often without permission. Such websites are generally full of advertising (such as pay-per-click ads), or they redirect the user to other sites. It is even feasible for scraper sites to outrank original websites for their own information and organization names.

===Article spinning===
Article spinning involves rewriting existing articles, as opposed to merely scraping content from other sites, to avoid penalties imposed by search engines for duplicate content. This process is undertaken by hired writers or automated using a thesaurus database or an artificial neural network.

===Machine translation===
Similarly to article spinning, some sites use machine translation to render their content in several languages, with no human editing, resulting in unintelligible texts that nonetheless continue to be indexed by search engines, thereby attracting traffic.

==Link spam==
Link spam is defined as links between pages that are present for reasons
other than merit. Link spam takes advantage of link-based ranking algorithms, which gives websites higher rankings the more other highly ranked websites link to it. These techniques also aim at influencing other link-based ranking techniques such as the HITS algorithm.

===Link farms===

Link farms are tightly-knit networks of websites that link to each other for the sole purpose of exploiting the search engine ranking algorithms. These are also known facetiously as &quot;mutual admiration societies&quot;. Use of links farms has greatly reduced with the launch of Google&#x27;s first Panda Update in February 2011, which introduced significant improvements in its spam-detection algorithm.

=== Private blog networks ===
Blog networks (PBNs) are a group of authoritative websites used as a source of contextual links that point to the owner&#x27;s main website to achieve higher search engine ranking. Owners of PBN websites use expired domains or auction domains that have backlinks from high-authority websites. Google targeted and penalized PBN users on several occasions with several massive deindexing campaigns since 2014.

===Hidden links===
Putting hyperlinks where visitors will not see them is used to increase link popularity. Highlighted link text can help rank a webpage higher for matching that phrase.

===Sybil attack===
A Sybil attack is the forging of multiple identities for malicious intent, named after the famous dissociative identity disorder patient and the book about her that shares her name, &quot;Sybil&quot;. A spammer may create multiple web sites at different domain names that all link to each other, such as fake blogs (known as spam blogs).

===Spam blogs===

Spam blogs are blogs created solely for commercial promotion and the passage of link authority to target sites. Often these &quot;splogs&quot; are designed in a misleading manner that will give the effect of a legitimate website but upon close inspection will often be written using spinning software or be very poorly written with barely readable content. They are similar in nature to link farms.

===Guest blog spam===

Guest blog spam is the process of placing guest blogs on websites for the sole purpose of gaining a link to another website or websites. Unfortunately, these are often confused with legitimate forms of guest blogging with other motives than placing links. This technique was made famous by Matt Cutts, who publicly declared &quot;war&quot; against this form of link spam.

===Buying expired domains===

Some link spammers utilize expired domain crawler software or monitor DNS records for domains that will expire soon, then buy them when they expire and replace the pages with links to their pages. However, it is possible but not confirmed that Google resets the link data on expired domains. To maintain all previous Google ranking data for the domain, it is advisable that a buyer grab the domain before it is &quot;dropped&quot;.

Some of these techniques may be applied for creating a Google bomb—that is, to cooperate with other users to boost the ranking of a particular page for a particular query.

=== Using world-writable pages ===

Web sites that can be edited by users can be used by spamdexers to insert links to spam sites if the appropriate anti-spam measures are not taken.

Automated spambots can rapidly make the user-editable portion of a site unusable.
Programmers have developed a variety of automated spam prevention techniques to block or at least slow down spambots.

====Spam in blogs====

Spam in blogs is the placing or solicitation of links randomly on other sites, placing a desired keyword into the hyperlinked text of the inbound link. Guest books, forums, blogs, and any site that accepts visitors&#x27; comments are particular targets and are often victims of drive-by spamming where automated software creates nonsense posts with links that are usually irrelevant and unwanted.

====Comment spam====
Comment spam is a form of link spam that has arisen in web pages that allow dynamic user editing such as wikis, blogs, and guestbooks. It can be problematic because agents can be written that automatically randomly select a user edited web page, such as a Wikipedia article, and add spamming links.

====Wiki spam====
Wiki spam is when a spammer uses the open editability of wiki systems to place links from the wiki site to the spam site.

====Referrer log spamming====
Referrer spam takes place when a spam perpetrator or facilitator accesses a web page (the &quot;referee&quot;), by following a link from another web page (the &quot;referrer&quot;), so that the referee is given the address of the referrer by the person&#x27;s web browser. Some websites have a referrer log which shows which pages link to that site. By having a robot randomly access many sites enough times, with a message or specific address given as the referrer, that message or Internet address then appears in the referrer log of those sites that have referrer logs. Since some Web search engines base the importance of sites on the number of different sites linking to them, referrer-log spam may increase the search engine rankings of the spammer&#x27;s sites. Also, site administrators who notice the referrer log entries in their logs may follow the link back to the spammer&#x27;s referrer page.

==== Countermeasures ====
Because of the large amount of spam posted to user-editable webpages, Google proposed a &quot;nofollow&quot; tag that could be embedded with links. A link-based search engine, such as Google&#x27;s PageRank system, will not use the link to increase the score of the linked website if the link carries a nofollow tag. This ensures that spamming links to user-editable websites will not raise the sites ranking with search engines. Nofollow is used by several websites, such as Wordpress, Blogger and Wikipedia.

==Other types==

===Mirror websites===
A mirror site is the hosting of multiple websites with conceptually similar content but using different URLs. Some search engines give a higher rank to results where the keyword searched for appears in the URL.

===URL redirection===
URL redirection is the taking of the user to another page without his or her intervention, &quot;e.g.&quot;, using META refresh tags, Flash, JavaScript, Java or Server side redirects. However, 301 Redirect, or permanent redirect, is not considered as a malicious behavior.

===Cloaking===
Cloaking refers to any of several means to serve a page to the search-engine spider that is different from that seen by human users. It can be an attempt to mislead search engines regarding the content on a particular web site. Cloaking, however, can also be used to ethically increase accessibility of a site to users with disabilities or provide human users with content that search engines aren&#x27;t able to process or parse. It is also used to deliver content based on a user&#x27;s location; Google itself uses IP delivery, a form of cloaking, to deliver results. Another form of cloaking is &quot;code swapping&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, optimizing a page for top ranking and then swapping another page in its place once a top ranking is achieved. Google refers to these type of redirects as &quot;Sneaky Redirects&quot;.

== Countermeasures ==
=== Page omission by search engine ===
Spamdexed pages are sometimes eliminated from search results by the search engine.

=== Page omission by user ===
Users can employ search operators for filtering. For Google, a keyword preceded by &quot;-&quot; (minus) will omit sites that contains the keyword in their pages or in the URL of the pages from search result. As an example, the search &quot;-&lt;unwanted site&gt;&quot; will eliminate sites that contains word &quot;&lt;unwanted site&gt;&quot; in their pages and the pages whose URL contains &quot;&lt;unwanted site&gt;&quot;.

Users could also use the Google Chrome extension &quot;Personal Blocklist (by Google)&quot;, launched by Google in 2011 as part of countermeasures against content farming. Via the extension, users could block a specific page, or set of pages from appearing in their search results. As of 2021, the original extension appears to be removed, although similar-functioning extensions may be used.

Possible solutions to overcome search-redirection poisoning redirecting to illegal internet pharmacies include notification of operators of vulnerable legitimate domains. Further, manual evaluation of SERPs, previously published link-based and content-based algorithms as well as tailor-made automatic detection and classification engines can be used as benchmarks in the effective identification of pharma scam campaigns.

<doc id="43653" wikidata="Q1187693" url="?curid=43653" title="Control-flow graph">
<text>In computer science, a control-flow graph (CFG) is a representation, using graph notation, of all paths that might be traversed through a program during its execution. The control-flow graph was conceived by Frances E. Allen, who noted that Reese T. Prosser used boolean connectivity matrices for flow analysis before.

The CFG is essential to many compiler optimizations and static-analysis tools.

== Definition ==
In a control-flow graph each node in the graph represents a basic block, i.e. a straight-line sequence of code with a single entry point and a single exit point, where no branches or jumps occur within the block. Basic blocks start with jump targets and end with jumps or branch instructions. Directed edges are used to represent jumps in the control flow. There are, in most presentations, two specially designated blocks: the &quot;entry block&quot;, through which control enters into the flow graph, and the &quot;exit block&quot;, through which all control flow leaves.

Because of its construction procedure, in a CFG, every edge A→B has the property that:
: outdegree(A) &gt; 1 or indegree(B) &gt; 1 (or both).

The CFG can thus be obtained, at least conceptually, by starting from the program&#x27;s (full) flow graph—i.e. the graph in which every node represents an individual instruction—and performing an edge contraction for every edge that falsifies the predicate above, i.e. contracting every edge whose source has a single exit and whose destination has a single entry. This contraction-based algorithm is of no practical importance, except as a visualization aid for understanding the CFG construction, because the CFG can be more efficiently constructed directly from the program by scanning it for basic blocks.

==Example==
Consider the following fragment of code:

In the above, we have 4 basic blocks: A from 0 to 1, B from 2 to 3, C at 4 and D at 5. In particular, in this case, A is the &quot;entry block&quot;, D the &quot;exit block&quot; and lines 4 and 5 are jump targets. A graph for this fragment has edges from A to B, A to C, B to D and C to D.

== Reachability ==
Reachability is a graph property useful in optimization.

If a subgraph is not connected from the subgraph containing the entry block, that subgraph is unreachable during any execution, and so is unreachable code; under normal conditions it can be safely removed.

If the exit block is unreachable from the entry block, an infinite loop may exist. Not all infinite loops are detectable, see Halting problem. A halting order may also exist there.

Unreachable code and infinite loops are possible even if the programmer does not explicitly code them: optimizations like constant propagation and constant folding followed by jump threading can collapse multiple basic blocks into one, cause edges to be removed from a CFG, etc., thus possibly disconnecting parts of the graph.

==Domination relationship==
A block M &quot;dominates&quot; a block N if every path from the entry that reaches block N has to pass through block M. The entry block dominates all blocks.

In the reverse direction, block M &quot;postdominates&quot; block N if every path from N to the exit has to pass through block M. The exit block postdominates all blocks.

It is said that a block M &quot;immediately dominates&quot; block N if M dominates N, and there is no intervening block P such that M dominates P and P dominates N. In other words, M is the last dominator on all paths from entry to N. Each block has a unique immediate dominator.

Similarly, there is a notion of &quot;immediate postdominator&quot;, analogous to &quot;immediate dominator&quot;.

The &quot;dominator tree&quot; is an ancillary data structure depicting the dominator relationships. There is an arc from Block M to Block N if M is an immediate dominator of N. This graph is a tree, since each block has a unique immediate dominator. This tree is rooted at the entry block. The dominator tree can be calculated efficiently using Lengauer–Tarjan&#x27;s algorithm.

A &quot;postdominator tree&quot; is analogous to the &quot;dominator tree&quot;. This tree is rooted at the exit block.

==Special edges==

A &quot;back edge&quot; is an edge that points to a block that has already been met during a depth-first (DFS) traversal of the graph. Back edges are typical of loops.

A &quot;critical edge&quot; is an edge which is neither the only edge leaving its source block, nor the only edge entering its destination block. These edges must be &quot;split&quot;: a new block must be created in the middle of the edge, in order to insert computations on the edge without affecting any other edges.

An &quot;abnormal edge&quot; is an edge whose destination is unknown. Exception handling constructs can produce them. These edges tend to inhibit optimization.

An &quot;impossible edge&quot; (also known as a &quot;fake edge&quot;) is an edge which has been added to the graph solely to preserve the property that the exit block postdominates all blocks. It cannot ever be traversed.

==Loop management==

A &quot;loop header&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;entry point&quot; of the loop) is a dominator that is the target of a loop-forming back edge. The loop header dominates all blocks in the loop body. A block may be a loop header for more than one loop. A loop may have multiple entry points, in which case it has no &quot;loop header&quot;.

Suppose block M is a dominator with several incoming edges, some of them being back edges (so M is a loop header). It is advantageous to several optimization passes to break M up into two blocks Mpre and Mloop. The contents of M and back edges are moved to Mloop, the rest of the edges are moved to point into Mpre, and a new edge from Mpre to Mloop is inserted (so that Mpre is the immediate dominator of Mloop). In the beginning, Mpre would be empty, but passes like loop-invariant code motion could populate it. Mpre is called the &quot;loop pre-header&quot;, and Mloop would be the loop header.

== Reducibility ==

A reducible CFG is one with edges that can be partitioned into two disjoint sets: forward edges, and back edges, such that:

* Forward edges form a directed acyclic graph with all nodes reachable from the entry node.
* For all back edges (A, B), node B dominates node A.

Structured programming languages are often designed such that all CFGs they produce are reducible, and common structured programming statements such as IF, FOR, WHILE, BREAK, and CONTINUE produce reducible graphs. To produce irreducible graphs, statements such as GOTO are needed. Irreducible graphs may also be produced by some compiler optimizations.

== Loop connectedness ==
The loop connectedness of a CFG is defined with respect to a given depth-first search tree (DFST) of the CFG. This DFST should be rooted at the start node and cover every node of the CFG.

Edges in the CFG which run from a node to one of its DFST ancestors (including itself) are called back edges.

The loop connectedness is the largest number of back edges found in any cycle-free path of the CFG. In a reducible CFG, the loop connectedness is independent of the DFST chosen.

Loop connectedness has been used to reason about the time complexity of data-flow analysis.

== Inter-procedural control-flow graph ==

While control-flow graphs represent the control flow of a single procedure, inter-procedural control-flow graphs represent the control flow of whole programs.

<text>Daniel Niklaus Chodowiecki (16 October 1726 – 7 February 1801) was a German painter and printmaker of Huguenot and Polish ancestry, who is most famous as an etcher. He spent most of his life in Berlin, and became the director of the Berlin Academy of Art.

==Family==
He was born in the city of Danzig (Gdańsk) in Poland, and in a letter “in typical Berlin humor” wrote “that he moved to Berlin, Germany, which shows for sure, that he is a &#x27;genuine Pole&#x27;.” He kept close to the Huguenot scene, due to his ancestry.

According to Chodowiecki himself, his Polish nobleman paternal ancestor Bartłomiej Chodowiecki lived in the 16th century in Greater Poland, though this is not confirmed by independent records. Gottfried Chodowiecki, Daniel&#x27;s father, was a tradesman in Danzig and his mother, Henriette Ayrer, of Swiss ancestry, was a Huguenot. Daniel&#x27;s grandfather Christian was also a Danzig tradesman, who had moved his business there from Toruń. When his father died, both Daniel (aged 16) and his younger brother Gottfried Chodowiecki went to live with their uncle in Berlin, who offered to educate them. In Germany Daniel received artistic training from the painter Haid in Augsburg. His brother also became a painter.
He and his wife Jeanne Barez (1726–1785) had three daughters, Jeannette (b. 1761, married the French reformed preacher Jacques Papin), Suzanne (1763–1819) and Henriette (1770–1880). Jeannette&#x27;s daughter Marianne Gretschel née Chodowiecka Papin (1794–1870) and her son Heinrich Papin (1786–1839) also became artists.

==Art==
Soon Daniel was able to earn a living by painting. He was admitted to the Berlin Academy in 1764 and became vice-director under Bernhard Rode in 1788. He found his true calling and became the most famous German graphic artist of his time. His works include several thousand etchings, usually rather small, and many drawings and paintings. His book illustrations embrace almost all the great classics. His prints represent in great detail the life of the bourgeoisie during the &quot;Zopfstil&quot; period, a time between Rococo and Classicism. In 1797 Chodowiecki was appointed director of the Academy of Arts in Berlin, where he died on 7 February 1801. The bulk of his work was in illustrating scientific books by Basedow, Buffon, Lavater, Pestalozzi and others. He also painted many portraits of Polish nobility and was interested in Huguenot and Polish history as well, making some paintings on the subjects. 
He was in tune with the developing spirit of the age, and many works reflect the cult of sensibility, and then the revolutionary and German nationalist feelings of the end of the century.

In printmaking, he is credited with the invention of the deliberate &quot;remarque&quot;, a small sketch on a plate lying outside the main image. These were originally little sketches or doodles by artists, not really meant to be seen, but Chodowiecki turned them into &quot;bonus items&quot; for collectors.

Chodowiecki, though speaking only French and German (due to his offices in the Huguenot French community in Berlin he often spoke French), many times also declared his Polish allegiance and had his son Isaac Heinrich, born in Berlin, painted as a very young child with a Polish outfit and haircut. After the Partitions of Poland Chodowiecki wrote to Gräfin Solms-Laubach: &quot;From my father&#x27;s side I am Polish, a descendant of a brave nation which will soon vanish&quot;. In a letter to :pl:Józef Łęski, a Polish astronomer, he wrote: &quot;I consider it an honour to be a genuine Pole, even though I am now living in Germany&quot;. Because of his mother&#x27;s and his wife&#x27;s Huguenot descent he was very close to the Huguenots of Berlin. Nearly all his life and career was spent in Germany, writing in German and living in Berlin from the age of almost 17.

One of his most popular books is the &quot;Journey from Berlin to Danzig&quot; (, 1773) with many illustrations. He purchased a horse rather than going by stage coach. This was his first return after 30 years absence and he went specifically to see his elderly mother and sisters in Danzig again. He made only one more trip to Danzig afterwards, to his mother&#x27;s funeral. He describes and illustrates towns and people in Pomerania and Prussia on the way.

Chodowiecki is buried at the &quot;Französischer Friedhof&quot; cemetery in Berlin.

A short animation entitled &quot;Chodowiecki&quot;, based on Chodowiecki&#x27;s life and work, was produced in 2020 by Polish director Jakub Pączek. All the scenes in the film were composed of graphics by Chodowiecki, digitized, processed and animated for this sole purpose. The film is available free of charge at www.Chodowiecki.com.

<text>James W. Sturr Jr. (born September 25, 1941), commonly known as Jimmy Sturr, is an American polka musician, trumpeter, clarinetist, saxophonist and leader of Jimmy Sturr &amp; His Orchestra. Media outlets have often dubbed him the &quot;King of Polka,&quot; with his recordings having won 18 out of the 24 Grammy Awards given for Best Polka Album. Sturr&#x27;s orchestra is on the Top Ten List of the All-Time Grammy Awards, and has acquired more Grammy nominations than anyone in the history of musical polka awards.

==Career==
Sturr and his orchestra have performed at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center in New York City, Yankee Stadium and the Palace of Culture in Warsaw, Poland. When touring, the band rides in Jimmy&#x27;s 45-foot customized tour bus, previously owned by Billy Ray Cyrus. The band has crossed genres and collaborated with numerous prominent musicians such as Willie Nelson, Brenda Lee, Arlo Guthrie, Boots Randolph, The Oak Ridge Boys, Mel Tillis, and Charlie Daniels.

A significant highlight for Jimmy Sturr &amp; His Orchestra was when they were invited to appear on the Grand Ole Opry, the only polka group (and the only group with brass instruments) to do so.

Sturr hosts a syndicated radio show on stations including WTBQ in his hometown of Florida, New York, the station he once owned. He also has a weekly radio show on the Rural Radio channel on SirusXM. In addition to radio shows, he also owns and operates United Polka Artists, Starr Record Company, Jimmy Sturr Travel Agency, and a publishing company.

<doc id="43661" wikidata="Q1069389" url="?curid=43661" title="Cadenza">
<text>In music, a cadenza, (from , meaning cadence; plural, &quot;cadenze&quot; ) is, generically, an improvised or written-out ornamental passage played or sung by a soloist(s), usually in a &quot;free&quot; rhythmic style, and often allowing virtuosic display. During this time the accompaniment will rest, or sustain a note or chord. Thus an improvised cadenza is indicated in written notation by a fermata in all parts. A cadenza will usually occur over either the final or penultimate note in a piece, the lead-in (), or the final or penultimate note in an important subsection of a piece. A cadenza can also be found before a final coda or ritornello.

== Origin ==
Initially, cadenzas were more simple and structured - a performer would add small embellishments such as trills to the end of cadences. These small embellishments of the early cadenza did not affect meter. However, as the improvised embellishments continued, they became longer and more thought out. This made way for the &#x27;composed&#x27; cadenza which ultimately progressed into the &#x27;free&#x27; metered feel that is more commonly associated with cadenzas today. Performers are able to play without being tied to meter or a strict time, and accompanists in orchestra await their entrance.

==In concerti==
The term &quot;cadenza&quot; often refers to a portion of a concerto in which the orchestra stops playing, leaving the soloist to play alone in free time (without a strict, regular pulse) and can be written or improvised, depending on what the composer specifies. Sometimes, a cadenza will include small parts for other instruments besides the soloist; an example is in Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3, where a solo flute, clarinet and horn are used over rippling arpeggios in the piano. A cadenza normally occurs near the end of the first movement, though it can be at any point in a concerto. An example is Tchaikovsky&#x27;s First Piano Concerto, where in the first five minutes a cadenza is used. The cadenza is usually the most elaborate and virtuosic part that the solo instrument plays during the whole piece. At the end of the cadenza, the orchestra re-enters, and generally finishes off the movement on their own, or, less often, with the solo instrument.

===Cadential trill===
Typically during the classical period, a solo cadenza in a concerto would end with a trill, usually on the supertonic, preceding the re-entry of the orchestra for the movement&#x27;s coda. Extended cadential trills were frequent in Mozart&#x27;s piano concerti; they may also be found in violin concerti and concerti for stringed instruments of the period up to the early 19th century (see illustration at head of this article).

==As a vocal flourish==
The cadenza was originally, and remains, a vocal flourish improvised by a performer to elaborate a cadence in an aria. It was later used in instrumental music, and soon became a standard part of the concerto. Cadenzas for voice and wind instruments were to be performed in one breath, and they should not use distant keys. Originally, it was improvised in this context as well, but during the 19th century, composers began to write cadenzas out in full. Third parties also wrote cadenzas for works in which it was intended by the composer to be improvised, so the soloist could have a well formed solo that they could practice in advance. Some of these have become so widely played and sung that they are effectively part of the standard repertoire, as is the case with Joseph Joachim&#x27;s cadenza for Johannes Brahms&#x27; Violin Concerto, Beethoven&#x27;s set of cadenzas for Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto no. 20, and Estelle Liebling&#x27;s edition of cadenzas for operas such as Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La fille du régiment&quot; and &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;.

==In jazz==
Perhaps the most notable deviations from this tendency towards written (or absent) cadenzas are to be found in jazz, most often at the end of a ballad, though cadenzas in this genre are usually brief. Saxophonist John Coltrane, however, usually improvised an extended cadenza when performing &quot;I Want To Talk About You&quot;, in which he showcased his predilections for scalar improvisation and multiphonics. The recorded examples of &quot;I Want To Talk About You&quot; (&quot;Live at Birdland&quot; and &quot;Afro Blue Impressions&quot;) are approximately 8 minutes in length, with Coltrane&#x27;s unaccompanied cadenza taking up approximately 3 minutes. More sardonically, jazz critic Martin Williams once described Coltrane&#x27;s improvisations on &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; as &quot;essentially extended cadenzas to pieces that never get played.&quot; Equally noteworthy is saxophonist Sonny Rollins&#x27; shorter improvised cadenza at the close of &quot;Three Little Words&quot; (&quot;Sonny Rollins on Impulse!&quot;).

Cadenzas are also found in instrumental solos with piano or other accompaniment, where they are placed near the beginning or near the end or sometimes in both places (e.g. the cornet solo &quot;The Maid of the Mist&quot; by Herbert L. Clarke, or the end of &quot;Think of Me&quot; in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, where Christine Daaé sings a short but involved cadenza).

==Notable examples==
*Concertos are not the only pieces that feature cadenzas; &quot;Scena di Canta Gitano&quot;, the fourth movement of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio Espagnol&quot;, contains cadenzas for horns and trumpets, violin, flute, clarinet, and harp in its beginning section.
*Johann Strauss II unusually wrote a cadenza-like solo for cello and flute for the final section of his &quot;Emperor Waltz&quot;, before the piece is brought to an end by a round of trumpets and then the whole orchestra.
*The second movement of Bach&#x27;s third Brandenburg Concerto consists of just two chords; it is generally taken to indicate a cadenza to be improvised around that cadence.
*The first movement of Bach&#x27;s fifth Brandenburg Concerto features an extensive written cadenza for harpsichord.
*The coloratura arias of bel canto composers Gaetano Donizetti, Vincenzo Bellini, and Gioachino Rossini.
*Mozart wrote the cadenzas for violin and viola duet in the first and second movements of the &quot;Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola, and Orchestra&quot;, K. 364.
*Mozart wrote a cadenza into the third and final movement of Piano Sonata in B-flat major, K. 333, which was an unusual (but not unique) choice at that time because the movement is otherwise in sonata-rondo form.
*Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto contains a notated cadenza. It begins with a cadenza that is partly accompanied by the orchestra. Later in the first movement, the composer specifies that the soloist should play the music that is written out in the score, and not add a cadenza on one&#x27;s own.
* Beethoven famously included a cadenza-like solo for oboe in the recapitulation section of the first movement of his Symphony No. 5.
*Tchaikovsky&#x27;s first piano concerto is notable not only for having a cadenza within the first few minutes of the first movement, but also for having a &quot;second&quot; – substantially longer – cadenza in a more conventional place, near the end of the movement.
*Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3, in which the first movement features a long and incredibly difficult toccata-like cadenza with an even longer alternative or ossia cadenza written in a heavier chordal style. Both cadenzas lead to an identical section with arpeggios in the piano and a solo flute accompanying, before the cadenza ends quietly.
*Fritz Kreisler&#x27;s cadenzas for the first and third movements of Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto.
* Aaron Copland uses a cadenza in his Clarinet Concerto to connect the two movements.
*Karlheinz Stockhausen composed five ensemble cadenzas in his wind quintet &quot;Zeitmaße&quot; (1955–1956), cadenzas for piccolo trumpet and piccolo in &quot;Luzifers Tanz&quot; (1983), and a cadenza for cor anglais in his trio &quot;Balance&quot; (2007)
* Karol Szymanowski&#x27;s two violin concertos both feature cadenzas written by the violinist who was intended to play them, Paweł Kochański.
* In the third movement of Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto, there is an unexpected cadenza in which the orchestra supports the solo with a pizzicato tremolando effect (&quot;cadenza accompagnato&quot;).
* Franz Liszt&#x27;s Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 for piano contains the instruction &quot;cadenza ad libitum&quot; before the final coda, meaning it is at the pianist&#x27;s discretion that such a cadenza is added. Whilst most performers prefer to decline the invitation, some pianists such as Alfred Cortot, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Marc-André Hamelin have produced notable cadenzas for the work.
* Pianists Chick Corea and Makoto Ozone incorporated jazz cadenzas into an otherwise traditional performance in Japan of the Mozart Double Piano Concerto.
* Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s Scheherazade features numerous cadenzas for violin.
* Mozart wrote a cadenza in his own Horn Concerto No. 3, towards the end of the first of three movements.
* Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s second piano concerto contains a taxing five-minute cadenza that closes out the first movement.
* In Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s first cello concerto the third movement on its own is a cadenza connecting the second and fourth movements.
* Carlos Chávez&#x27;s Violin Concerto has a seven-minute unaccompanied cadenza as the third of its five main sections, despite the fact that the soloist plays almost without a break throughout the rest of the 35-minute-long composition

===Composed cadenzas===
Composers who have written cadenzas for other performers in works not their own include:

<text>Johann George Adam Forster, also known as Georg Forster (, 27 November 1754 – 10 January 1794), was a German geographer, naturalist, ethnologist, travel writer, journalist and revolutionary. At an early age, he accompanied his father, Johann Reinhold Forster, on several scientific expeditions, including James Cook&#x27;s second voyage to the Pacific. His report of that journey, &quot;A Voyage Round the World&quot;, contributed significantly to the ethnology of the people of Polynesia and remains a respected work. As a result of the report, Forster, who was admitted to the Royal Society at the early age of twenty-two, came to be considered one of the founders of modern scientific travel literature.

After returning to continental Europe, Forster turned toward academia. He taught natural history at the Collegium Carolinum in the Ottoneum, Kassel (1778–84), and later at the Academy of Vilna (Vilnius University) (1784–87). In 1788, he became head librarian at the University of Mainz. Most of his scientific work during this time consisted of essays on botany and ethnology, but he also prefaced and translated many books about travel and exploration, including a German translation of Cook&#x27;s diaries.

Forster was a central figure of the Enlightenment in Germany, and corresponded with most of its adherents, including his close friend Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. His ideas, travelogues and personality influenced Alexander von Humboldt, one of the great scientists of the 19th century who hailed Forster as the founder of both comparative ethnology (&quot;Völkerkunde&quot;) and regional geography (&quot;Länderkunde&quot;).
When the French took control of Mainz in 1792, Forster played a leading role in the Mainz Republic, the earliest republican state in Germany. During July 1793 and while he was in Paris as a delegate of the young Mainz Republic, Prussian and Austrian coalition forces regained control of the city and Forster was declared an outlaw. Unable to return to Germany and separated from his friends and family, he died in Paris of illness in early 1794, not yet 40.

== Early life ==
Georg Forster was born in Nassenhuben (now Mokry Dwór, Poland), a small village near Danzig, on 27 November 1754. Georg was the oldest of seven surviving children of Johann Reinhold Forster, a Reformed Protestant pastor and scholar, and his wife Justina Elisabeth, . From an early age, Georg was interested in the study of nature, and his father first learned natural history from the books of Carl Linnaeus and then taught his son biology as well as Latin, French, and religion. In 1765, Reinhold obtained a commission by the Russian government to inspect the recently founded colonies near Saratov on the Volga River, which were mostly settled by German colonists. Ten-year old Georg accompanied his father on the journey, which reached the Kalmyk Steppe and Lake Elton, and collected hundreds of specimens of plants, helping his father with naming and identification. From October 1765, he attended Saint Peter&#x27;s School in St Petersburg, while his father prepared a report about the state of the colony. Reinhold&#x27;s report was critical of the voivode of Saratov and of the conditions in the colony, and the Forsters left Russia without payment amidst quarrel with Grigory Orlov. After a sea journey from Kronstadt, during which Georg learned English and practiced Russian, they arrived in London on 4 October 1766. Twelve-year old Georg competently translated Lomonosov&#x27;s history of Russia into English and continued it until the present, and the printed book was presented to the Society of Antiquaries on 21 May 1767. His father took up a teaching position at Warrington Academy in June 1767, succeeding Joseph Priestley, leaving Georg behind in London as apprentice with a London merchant until the rest of the family arrived in England in September 1767. In Warrington, Georg learned classics and religion from John Aikin, mathematics from John Holt and French and natural history from his father.

== Around the world with Captain Cook ==
The Forsters moved back to London in 1770, where Reinhold Forster cultivated scientific contacts and became a member of the Royal Society in 1772. After the withdrawal of Joseph Banks, he was invited by the British Admiralty to join James Cook&#x27;s second expedition to the Pacific (1772–75). Georg Forster joined his father in the expedition again and was appointed as a draughtsman to his father. Johann Reinhold Forster&#x27;s task was to work on a scientific report of the journey&#x27;s discoveries that was to be published after their return.

They embarked HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; on 13 July 1772, in Plymouth. The ship&#x27;s route led first to the South Atlantic, then through the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean to the islands of Polynesia and finally around Cape Horn back to England, returning on 30 July 1775. During the three-year journey, the explorers visited New Zealand, the Tonga islands, New Caledonia, Tahiti, the Marquesas Islands and Easter Island. They went further south than anybody before them, almost discovering Antarctica. The journey conclusively disproved the &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot; theory, which claimed there was a big, habitable continent in the South.

Supervised by his father, Georg Forster first undertook studies of the zoology and botanics of the southern seas, mostly by drawing animals and plants. However, Georg also pursued his own interests, which led to completely independent explorations in comparative geography and ethnology. He quickly learned the languages of the Polynesian islands. His reports on the people of Polynesia are well regarded today, as they describe the inhabitants of the southern islands with empathy, sympathy and largely without Western or Christian bias.

Unlike Louis Antoine de Bougainville, whose reports from a journey to Tahiti a few years earlier had initiated uncritical &quot;noble savage&quot; romanticism, Forster developed a sophisticated picture of the societies of the South Pacific islands. He described various social structures and religions that he encountered on the Society Islands, Easter Island and in Tonga and New Zealand, and ascribed this diversity to the difference in living conditions of these people. At the same time, he also observed that the languages of these fairly widely scattered islands were similar. About the inhabitants of the Nomuka islands (in the Ha&#x27;apai island group of present-day Tonga), he wrote that their languages, vehicles, weapons, furniture, clothes, tattoos, style of beard, in short all of their being matched perfectly with what he had already seen while studying tribes on Tongatapu. However, he wrote, &quot;we could not observe any subordination among them, though this had strongly characterised the natives of Tonga-Tabboo, who seemed to descend even to servility in their obeisance to the king.&quot;

The journey was rich in scientific results. However, the relationship between the Forsters and Cook and his officers was often problematic, due to the elder Forster&#x27;s fractious temperament as well as Cook&#x27;s refusal to allow more time for botanical and other scientific observation. Cook refused scientists on his third journey after his experiences with the Forsters.

== Founder of modern travel literature ==

These conflicts continued after the journey with the problem of who should write the official account of the travels. Lord Sandwich, although willing to pay the promised money, was irritated with Johann Reinhold Forster&#x27;s opening chapter and tried to have it edited. However, Forster did not want to have his writing corrected &quot;like a theme of a School-boy&quot;, and stubbornly refused any compromise. As a result, the official account was written by Cook, and the Forsters were deprived of the right to compile the account and did not obtain payment for their work. During the negotiations, the younger Forster decided to release an unofficial account of their travels. In 1777, his book &quot;A Voyage Round the World in His Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Sloop Resolution, Commanded by Capt. James Cook, during the Years, 1772, 3, 4, and 5&quot; was published. This report was the first account of Cook&#x27;s second voyage (it appeared six weeks before the official publication) and was intended for the general public. The English version and his own translation into German (published 1778–80) earned the young author real fame. The poet Christoph Martin Wieland praised the book as the most important one of his time, and even today it remains one of the most important journey descriptions ever written. The book also had a significant impact on German literature, culture and science, influencing such scientists as Alexander von Humboldt and it inspired many ethnologists of later times.

Forster wrote well-polished German prose, which was not only scientifically accurate and objective, but also exciting and easy to read. This differed from conventional travel literature of the time, insofar as it presented more than a mere collection of data – it also demonstrated coherent, colourful and reliable ethnographical facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation. He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations. His main focus was always on the people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In &quot;A Voyage Round the World&quot; he even presented the songs sung by the people of Polynesia, complete with lyrics and notation. The book is one of the most important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.

Both Forsters also published descriptions of their South Pacific travels in the Berlin-based &quot;Magazin von merkwürdigen neuen Reisebeschreibungen&quot; (&quot;&quot;Magazine of strange new travel accounts&quot;), and Georg published a translation of &quot;A Voyage to the South Sea, by Lieutenant William Bligh, London 1792&quot;&quot; in 1791–93.

== Forster at universities ==
The publication of &quot;A Voyage Round the World&quot; brought Forster scientific recognition all over Europe. The respectable Royal Society made him a member on 9 January 1777, though he was not even 23 years old. He was granted similar titles from academies ranging from Berlin to Madrid. These appointments, however, were unpaid.

He travelled to Paris to seek out a discussion with the American revolutionary Benjamin Franklin in 1777. In 1778, he went to Germany to take a teaching position as a Natural History professor at the Collegium Carolinum in Kassel, where he met Therese Heyne, the daughter of classicist Christian Gottlob Heyne. They married in 1785 (which was after he left Kassel) and had two surviving children, Therese Forster and Clara Forster, but an unhappy marriage. She would eventually leave him for Ludwig Ferdinand Huber and became one of the first independent female writers in Germany. . From his time in Kassel on, Forster actively corresponded with important figures of the Enlightenment, including Lessing, Herder, Wieland and Goethe. He also initiated cooperation between the Carolinum in Kassel and the University of Göttingen where his friend Georg Christoph Lichtenberg worked. Together, they founded and published the scientific and literary journal &quot;Göttingisches Magazin der Wissenschaften und Litteratur&quot;. Forster&#x27;s closest friend, Samuel Thomas von Sömmering, arrived in Kassel shortly after Forster, and both were soon involved with the Rosicrucians in Kassel, where Forster took the secret name &quot;Amadeus Sragorisinus Segenitor&quot;.
However, by 1783 Forster saw that his involvement with the Rosicrucians not only led him away from real science, but also deeper into debt (it is said he was not good at money); for these reasons Forster was happy to accept a proposal by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Commission of National Education and became Chair of Natural History at Vilnius University in 1784. Initially, he was accepted well in Vilnius, but he felt more and more isolated with time. Most of his contacts were still with scientists in Germany; especially notable is his dispute with Immanuel Kant about the definition of race. In 1785, Forster traveled to Halle where he submitted his thesis on the plants of the South Pacific for a doctorate in medicine. Back in Vilnius, Forster&#x27;s ambitions to build a real natural history scientific centre could not get appropriate financial support from the authorities in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Moreover, his famous speech on natural history in 1785 went almost unnoticed and was not printed until 1843. These events led to high tensions between him and the local community. Eventually, he broke the contract six years short of its completion as Catherine II of Russia had offered him a place on a journey around the world (the Mulovsky expedition) for a high honorarium and a position as a professor in Saint Petersburg. This resulted in a conflict between Forster and the influential Polish scientist Jędrzej Śniadecki. However, the Russian proposal was withdrawn and Forster left Vilnius. He then settled in Mainz, where he became head librarian of the University of Mainz, a position held previously by his friend Johannes von Müller, who made sure Forster would succeed him when Müller moved to the administration of Elector Friedrich Karl Josef von Erthal.

Forster regularly published essays on contemporary explorations and continued to be a very prolific translator; for instance, he wrote about Cook&#x27;s third journey to the South Pacific, and about the &quot;Bounty&quot; expedition, as well as translating Cook&#x27;s and Bligh&#x27;s diaries from these journeys into German. From his London years, Forster was in contact with Sir Joseph Banks, the initiator of the Bounty expedition and a participant in Cook&#x27;s first journey. While at the University of Vilnius he wrote the article &quot;Neuholland und die brittische Colonie in Botany-Bay&quot;, published in the &quot;Allgemeines historisches Taschenbuch&quot; (Berlin, December 1786), an essay on the future prospects of the English colony founded in New South Wales in 1788.

Another interest of his was indology – one of the main goals of his failed expedition to be financed by Catherine II had been to reach India. He translated the Sanskrit play &quot;Shakuntala&quot; using a Latin version provided by Sir William Jones; this strongly influenced Johann Gottfried Herder, and triggered German interest in the culture of India.

== &quot;Views from the Lower Rhine&quot; ==

In the second quarter of 1790, Forster and the young Alexander von Humboldt started from Mainz on a long journey through the Southern Netherlands, the United Provinces, and England, eventually finishing in Paris. The impressions from the journey were described in a three volume publication &quot;Ansichten vom Niederrhein, von Brabant, Flandern, Holland, England und Frankreich im April, Mai und Juni 1790&quot; (&quot;Views of the Lower Rhine, from Brabant, Flanders, Holland, England, and France in April, May and June 1790&quot;), published 1791–94. Goethe said about the book: &quot;One wants, after one has finished reading, to start it over, and wishes to travel with such a good and knowledgeable observer.&quot; The book includes comments on the history of art that were as influential for the discipline as &quot;A Voyage Round the world&quot; was for ethnology. Forster was, for example, one of the first writers who gave just treatment to the Gothic architecture of Cologne Cathedral, which was widely perceived as &quot;barbarian&quot; at that time. The book conformed well to the early Romantic intellectual movements in German-speaking Europe.

Forster&#x27;s main interest, however, was again focused on the social behavior of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in Flanders and Brabant and the revolution in France sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens&#x27; freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on he was to be a confident opponent of the ancien régime. With other German scholars, he welcomed the outbreak of the revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as 30 July 1789, shortly after he heard about the Storming of the Bastille, he wrote to his father-in-law, philologist Christian Gottlob Heyne, that it was beautiful to see what philosophy had nurtured in people&#x27;s minds and then had realized in the state. To educate people about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all the surest way; the rest would then result as if by itself.

== Life as a revolutionary ==

=== Foundation of the Mainz Republic ===

The French revolutionary army under General Custine gained control over Mainz on 21 October 1792. Two days later, Forster joined others in establishing a Jacobin Club called &quot;Freunde der Freiheit und Gleichheit&quot; (&quot;Friends of Freedom and Equality&quot;) in the Electoral Palace. From early 1793 he was actively involved in organizing the Mainz Republic. This first republic located on German soil was constituted on the principles of democracy, and encompassed areas on the left bank of the Rhine between Landau and Bingen. Forster became vice-president of the republic&#x27;s temporary administration and a candidate in the elections to the local parliament, the (&quot;Rhenish-German National Convention&quot;). From January to March 1793, he was an editor of (&quot;The new Mainz newspaper or The People&#x27;s Friend&quot;), a name chosen in reference to Marat&#x27;s . In his first article he wrote:


This freedom did not last long, though. The Mainz Republic existed only until the retreat of the French troops in July 1793 after the siege of Mainz.

Forster was not present in Mainz during the siege. As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and Adam Lux had been sent to Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an independent state – to become a part of the French Republic. The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the old order was restored. Forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in Paris.

=== Death in revolutionary Paris ===
Based on a decree by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German subjects who collaborated with the French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set on his head and he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.

Before the reign of terror reached its climax, Forster died after a rheumatic illness in his small attic apartment at Rue des Moulins in Paris on 10 January 1794, at the age of thirty-nine. At the time, he was making plans to visit India.

== Views on nations and their culture ==
Forster had partial Scottish roots and was born in Polish Royal Prussia, and therefore was by birth a Polish subject. He worked in Russia, England, Poland and in several German countries of his time. Finally, he finished his life in France. He worked in different milieus and traveled a lot from his youth on. It was his view that this, together with his scientific upbringing based on the principles of the Enlightenment, gave him a wide perspective on different ethnic and national communities:

In his opinion all human beings have the same abilities with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him it is obvious that the culture on Tierra del Fuego is at a lower level of development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.

In contrast to the attitude expressed in these writings and to his Enlightenment background, he used insulting terms expressing prejudice against Poles in his private letters during his stay in Vilnius and in a diary from the journey through Poland, but he never published any manifestation of this attitude. These insults only became known after his death, when his private correspondence and diaries were released to the public. Since Forster&#x27;s published descriptions of other nations were seen as impartial scientific observations, Forster&#x27;s disparaging description of Poland in his letters and diaries was often taken at face value in Imperial and Nazi Germany, where it was used as a means of science-based support for a purported German superiority. The spreading of the &quot;Polnische Wirtschaft&quot; (Polish economy) stereotype is most likely due to the influence of his letters.

Forster&#x27;s attitude brought him into conflict with the people of the different nations he encountered and made him welcome nowhere, as he was too revolutionary and antinational for Germans, proud and opposing in his dealings with Englishmen, too unconcerned about Polish science for Poles, and too insignificant politically and ignored while in France.

== Legacy ==
After Forster&#x27;s death, his works were mostly forgotten, except in professional circles. This was partly due to his involvement in the French revolution. However, his reception changed with the politics of the times, with different periods focusing on different parts of his work. In the period of rising nationalism after the Napoleonic era he was regarded in Germany as a &quot;traitor to his country&quot;, overshadowing his work as an author and scientist. This attitude rose even though the philosopher Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel wrote about Forster at the beginning of the 19th century:

Some interest in Forster&#x27;s life and revolutionary actions was revived in the context of the liberal sentiments leading up to the 1848 revolution. But he was largely forgotten in the Germany of Wilhelm II and more so in Nazi Germany, where interest in Forster was limited to his stance on Poland from his private letters. Interest in Forster resumed in the 1960s in East Germany, where he was interpreted as a champion of class struggle. The GDR research station in Antarctica that was opened on 25 October 1987, was named after him. In West Germany, the search for democratic traditions in German history also led to a more diversified picture of him in the 1970s. The Alexander von Humboldt foundation named a scholarship program for foreign scholars from developing countries after him. His reputation as one of the first and most outstanding German ethnologists is indisputable, and his works are seen as crucial in the development of ethnology in Germany into a separate branch of science.

The ethnographical items collected by Georg and Johann Reinhold Forster are now presented as the &quot;Cook-Forster-Sammlung&quot; (Cook–Forster Collection) in the Sammlung für Völkerkunde anthropological collection in Göttingen. Another collection of items collected by the Forsters is on display at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford.

<text>Johannes Daniel Falk (28 October 1768 Danzig – 14 February 1826 Weimar) was a German publisher and poet.

Falk was born in Danzig (Gdańsk) in the Polish province of Royal Prussia, where he received his first education against the wishes of his father, who wanted to employ the child in his business as wig maker. The Danzig city council granted Falk a theology stipendium at Halle, but he did not become a preacher and frequented literary circles of Schiller and Goethe instead.

In late 1815 or early 1816, he wrote the German text &quot;O du fröhliche&quot; that became a popular Christmas carol, to the melody of the Catholic hymn &quot;O Sanctissima&quot;.

Falk was the founder of the &quot;Falk&#x27;sche Institute&quot;, a public education place for orphans in Weimar. He died in that city in 1826.
