<text>John Morton ( – 15 September 1500) was an English cleric, civil lawyer and administrator during the period of the Wars of the Roses. He entered royal service under Henry VI and was a trusted councillor under Edward IV and Henry VII. Edward IV made him Bishop of Ely and under Henry VII he became Lord Chancellor, Archbishop of Canterbury and a cardinal.

== Early life ==
Morton was born in around 1420 either in Milborne St Andrew or Bere Regis in Dorset. He came from the minor gentry of the time: his father was Richard Morton of Milborne St Andrew and his uncle, William Morton of Cerne, represented Shaftesbury in Parliament in 1437. Morton was educated at the University of Oxford, becoming a Bachelor of Civil Law in 1448, a Bachelor of Civil and Canon Law in 1451 and a Doctor of Civil Law in 1452. He practised as a proctor in the chancellor&#x27;s court at Oxford from 1448 and in 1451 he was acting as a commissary or deputy and official of the chancellor of the university. In 1452 he became principal of the civil law school and in 1453 he became the principal of Peckwater Inn where he had previously been a fellow. Later in life, Morton was elected as Chancellor of the University of Oxford for life in 1495 and as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 1499.

Morton also practised as an advocate in the Court of Arches, the ecclesiastical court of the Province of Canterbury. As a result of his work as a civil lawyer Morton came to the notice of Thomas Bourchier, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1454, and on 26 September 1456 he entered royal service, being appointed as chancellor of the infant Edward, Prince of Wales.

Morton was ordained as an acolyte and subdeacon on 17 December 1457, as a deacon on 17 February 1458 and as a priest on 10 March 1458. He had already obtained his first benefices, as rector of Shellingford in Berkshire (23 January 1453) and rector of Maiden Newton in Dorset (21 March 1457). In 1458 he was granted a papal dispensation to hold three benefices at the same time. In May 1458 he was made a subdean and prebend of Lincoln Cathedral, in November 1458 a prebend of Salisbury, and by 1461 he was also rector of Bloxworth in Dorset and archdeacon of Norwich.

In 1459 the Duke of York, the Earl of Salisbury, and Salisbury&#x27;s eldest son, the Earl of Warwick, rose in rebellion against Henry VI but they fled after the Rout of Ludford Bridge. Morton was one of a number of lawyers involved in drawing up the act of attainder against the Yorkist lords passed by the parliament which met in Coventry in November 1459. After the defeat of the Lancastrian forces at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461, Morton was captured at Cockermouth along with the Earl of Wiltshire. They were brought to Edward IV in Newcastle where Wiltshire was beheaded while Morton was sent to the Tower of London.

Morton was included in the act of attainder passed by Edward IV&#x27;s first parliament in November 1461 and he lost all the benefices which he had accumulated. However, he escaped and joined Queen Margaret of Anjou in France, being appointed Keeper of the Privy Seal to Henry VI and assisting in the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Tours on 28 June 1462. He accompanied the queen when, with French and Scottish support, she made incursions into Northumberland in 1462 and 1463. After these attempts to restore Henry VI failed, Morton returned to France with the queen and shared the exile of the small Lancastrian court at the Chateau of Koeur near Saint-Mihiel in Lorraine. In 1469 he was admitted to study theology at the University of Louvain.

== Service under Edward IV ==
Following the final defeat of the Lancastrian cause at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471, Morton was granted a pardon by Edward IV and resumed his career in royal service. By 29 September 1471 (Michaelmas) he was appointed as a Master in Chancery and on 16 March 1472 he was granted the office of Master of the Rolls. Besides being the keeper of the rolls of the Chancery, the parchment rolls which formed the official records of the government of England, the Master of the Rolls was by this time a judicial official, second only to the Lord Chancellor in the Court of Chancery. He also acted as the keeper of the Great Seal during a vacancy in the office of Lord Chancellor or during the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s temporary absence.

In 1474 Morton became in addition Dean of the Arches, the judge presiding in the Court of Arches. He also began once again to accumulate benefices, being made Rector of St Dunstan-in-the-East in London in 1472 (exchanged in 1474 for appointments as Rector of South Molton in Devon and master of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in Bristol), a prebend of St Paul&#x27;s in London in 1473, archdeacon of Chester (1474), Winchester (1475), Huntingdon (1475), Berkshire (1476), Norfolk (1477) and Leicester (1478) and a prebend of Wells (1476), York (1476) and Exeter (1476).

Civil lawyers were also in demand for diplomatic missions and Morton left England in early January 1474 together with Lord Duras on an embassy to Burgundy. He did not return until early June. In December 1474 he was despatched on another embassy to Burgundy along with Sir Thomas Montgomery and the king&#x27;s secretary, William Hatclyf. They were also commissioned to seek alliances against France with the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick III, and Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary. After Edward IV invaded France in the middle of 1475, Morton was involved in negotiating the Treaty of Picquigny (29 August 1475) by which Louis XI undertook to pay Edward IV 75,000 crowns within fifteen days, and 50,000 crowns yearly thereafter as long as they both lived, in exchange for the withdrawal of the English army. Along with other members of the English court, Morton was rewarded by Louis XI with an annual pension, in his case of 600 crowns.

On 16 February 1477 Edward IV sent Morton and Sir John Donne as ambassadors to Louis XI to seek the extension of the truce under the Treaty of Picquigny. When Louis XI sent ambassadors to England in July 1477 to continue negotiations, Morton was one of those appointed to meet them. By a treaty made on 21 July 1477 the truce was extended for the lives of the kings and for a year after the death of whichever of them died first. On 21 January 1479 Edward IV instructed Morton and others to begin negotiations with the French ambassador, Charles de Martigny, Bishop of Elne, with a view to extending the truce between the two nations to last for one hundred and one years and to pay the pension of 50,000 crowns yearly throughout that period to Edward and his successors. In February 1479 the bishop signed agreements to that effect drawn up by Morton.

In the meanwhile, Morton had been consecrated by Archbishop Bourchier as Bishop of Ely in the chapel at Lambeth on 31 January 1479 and he vacated the other ecclesiastical offices which he had accumulated. It was during this period that Morton was mentioned by the visiting Italian observer, Dominic Mancini, as being, along with Archbishop Thomas Rotherham and William, Lord Hastings, &quot;of no small influence&quot; with the king. Mancini wrote that &quot;these men being in age mature, and instructed by long experience of public affairs, helped more than other councillors to form the king&#x27;s policy, and besides carried it out&quot;.
As Bishop of Ely, Morton initiated various building works, including rebuilding the Bishop&#x27;s Palace at Hatfield in Hertfordshire which had been in the possession of the Bishops of Ely since 1109. Morton rebuilt it in about 1480 as a stately manor house, all in brick. He was also responsible for the construction of Morton&#x27;s Leam, a cut or ditch twelve miles in length, forty feet broad and four feet deep, from Stanground near Peterborough to Guyhirn, by which water was channelled from the River Nene to Wisbech. Morton had a tower built to monitor the works.

== Exile under Richard III ==
Edward IV died unexpectedly on 9 April 1483 and Morton was involved in making arrangements for the coronation of his elder son as Edward V. However, on 13 June he was arrested at a council meeting along with Lord Hastings and Archbishop Rotherham. They were accused of treason by the king&#x27;s uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and Hastings was beheaded. Morton and Rotherham were imprisoned in the Tower of London. Gloucester was crowned as Richard III on 6 July 1483. Rotherham was soon restored to favour but Morton was committed to the custody of Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, who sent him to his castle at Brecon in Wales. Morton was involved in the failed uprising known as Buckingham&#x27;s rebellion but he subsequently escaped to Flanders from where he continued to coordinate opposition to Richard III. In particular, when Richard III was seeking the return of Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, from Brittany, Morton sent Christopher Urswick to alert him, and Henry was able to escape over the border into France.

Morton was included in the Acts of Attainder passed by Richard III&#x27;s first (and only) parliament which met at Westminster in January 1484 and he once again lost all his temporal possessions. He was granted an unsolicited pardon on 11 December 1484 but he nevertheless refused to return to England. He is known to have been in Rome by 31 January 1485, when he signed the register of the Santo Spirito fraternity, and he was still there in April, when he secured a papal brief for the reform of Peterhouse, and probably on 7 May, when a papal indulgence was secured, the proceeds of which were to go to the repair of the dykes of the Isle of Ely and Ely Cathedral, damaged in recent floods. His real mission, however, may have been to secure papal dispensation for Richmond&#x27;s intended marriage to Edward IV&#x27;s eldest daughter, Elizabeth of York, which was necessary because both were descended from John of Gaunt.

== Service under Henry VII ==
Henry VII summoned Morton back to England immediately after his victory at the Battle of Bosworth and he was probably present at Henry&#x27;s coronation at Westminster on 30 October 1485. On 6 March 1486 he was made Lord Chancellor. This was a judicial office, presiding over the equitable jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery which continued to expand during his tenure. He was Henry VII&#x27;s most trusted adviser, being present at nearly every meeting of the king&#x27;s council for which records survive. The overall direction of policy in domestic and international affairs remained in the king&#x27;s hands, advised by his councillors, but Morton and other royal clerks carried out the administrative work of putting his decisions into effect.

In the seventeenth century Francis Bacon attributed to Morton the device known as Morton&#x27;s fork, whereby those who were lavish in their manner of living were told by the tax commissioners that they could obviously afford to give more to the king while those who were frugal were likewise told that they should contribute more because they must have put aside savings. However, this was Bacon&#x27;s invention. It is true that the king&#x27;s councillors, in particular Morton and Reginald Bray, were blamed by the Cornish rebels in 1497 for the level of taxation, but it was only after the deaths of Morton in 1500 and Bray in 1503 that Henry&#x27;s financial exactions, in particular his imposition of bonds on many of his subjects and his exploitation of his prerogative rights, became more burdensome. The historian Polydore Vergil wrote that Morton and Bray were the two councillors who could reprove Henry VII when necessary and that it became obvious after their deaths that they had been responsible, not for aggravating royal harshness, but for restraining it.

Cardinal Bourchier died at Knole on 30 March 1486 and Henry VII prevailed upon the monks of Canterbury to elect Morton as his successor as Archbishop of Canterbury. The pope signified his agreement to this appointment by a bull dated 6 October and Morton was enthroned on 21 January 1487. After much pressure from Henry VII, he was made a cardinal on 20 September 1493. With the support of the papacy, Morton pursued reform of religious houses such as the Abbey of St Albans and the Cluniac house of St Andrew&#x27;s, Northampton. He was not accused of personal aggrandisement but he sought to defend the traditional prerogatives of the Archbishop of Canterbury and he defended the jurisdiction of the archbishop&#x27;s courts over wills where the testator had substantial goods in more than one diocese.

As he had done when he was Bishop of Ely, Morton engaged in various building works while he was Archbishop of Canterbury. Cardinal Bourchier had left the manor of Knole to the see of Canterbury in 1480 and Morton carried out repairs and improvements of what was to be one of his favourite residences as archbishop. At Lambeth Palace, which was his principal residence, he built the brick gatehouse, called Morton&#x27;s Tower. He also rebuilt or added to his residences at Croydon, Maidstone, Charing, Ford (near Reculver), Allington (modern Aldington) and the palace at Canterbury. Morton&#x27;s crowning achievement as archbishop in terms of building works was the completion of the central crossing tower of Canterbury Cathedral, known as Bell Harry Tower. This was initially built as a simple lantern tower, like that at York, but in around 1494 it was decided to add an extra fifty feet to the tower and the exterior stonework bears Morton&#x27;s rebus – a falcon or &#x27;mort&#x27; perched on a cask or &#x27;tun&#x27; – as evidence of his involvement.

== Morton&#x27;s legacy ==
Morton died at Knole on 15 September 1500. A London chronicler said that he was:a man worthi of memory for his many greate Actes and specially for his greate wisdom, which contynued to the tyme of his Discease, passyng the yeres of iiijxx and odde; in our tyme was no man lyke to be compared wt him in all thynges; Albeit that he lyved not wtoute the greate Disdayn and greate haterede of the Comons of this land The mention of the hatred of the commons was perhaps a reference to the fact that, as mentioned above in relation to the Cornish rebellion, he was blamed for the heavy burden of taxation. The Spanish ambassador, De Puebla, wrote on 27 December 1500 that &quot;the Cardinal of England is dead, and has left no statesman behind who can be compared to him&quot;. John Haryngton, the proctor of the English Cistercians, and therefore an opponent of Morton&#x27;s attempt to extend his jurisdiction to include exempt religious houses, including the Cistercians, said that he saw in him &quot;nothing but the qualities of a good judge&quot; and that in his opinion he was:a man of great learning and profound wisdom, devoted to the service of God, concerned for the public welfare rather than for his own advantage, immersing himself profitably in both religious and secular affairs, and not shrinking from the heat and burden of the day.Morton left money in his will to pay for the maintenance of twenty poor scholars at Oxford University and ten poor scholars at Cambridge University for twenty years. He made provision for masses to be said for the salvation of his soul for twenty years and he left 1,000 marks to be distributed as alms for the poor. His closeness to the royal family is demonstrated by the bequests of his best portable breviary to Henry VII, his best psalter to the queen, an image of the Blessed Virgin in gold to the king&#x27;s mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort, and a gold goblet and £40 to the king&#x27;s eldest daughter, Princess Margaret, whom he described as his &quot;beloved god-daughter&quot;. In addition, he left a year&#x27;s wages to his lay servants. He died in possession of extensive estates which were mainly left to his relatives but he left lands in the park of Mote, near Maidstone, and the mill adjacent to this park, to the cathedral of Canterbury.

Morton asked that he be buried under a plain marble slab before the statue of the Virgin known as Our Lady of Undercroft in Canterbury Cathedral. After the pavement became cracked and broken, parts of his body were taken away and his skull is now in the keeping of Stonyhurst College.

The books that are known to have belonged to Morton are mainly works of canon and civil law although they include Seneca&#x27;s letters and works on oratory and rhetoric. Giovanni Gigli, a humanist and papal collector, dedicated to him a short tract on the canonization of saints. A chaplain in his household, Henry Medwall, wrote the first play to be printed in English, &quot;Fulgens and Lucrece&quot;, which may have been performed before the members of the court at Lambeth in 1497. In 1500 Morton financed the printing by Richard Pynson of the Salisbury or Sarum missal. This was the second edition of the Sarum missal to have been printed in England and it includes the first music printed in England.

Sir Thomas More served as a page in Morton&#x27;s household between the ages of 12 and 14, that is, from around 1490 to 1492, and he included a pen portrait of Morton in his &quot;Utopia&quot;. Almost a century after Morton&#x27;s death a theory arose that he had actually written More&#x27;s &quot;History of King Richard III&quot; but More&#x27;s authorship of this work is not now questioned. Morton may have been one of More&#x27;s sources of information for the &quot;History&quot; but More had access to many sources, both oral and written, and he invented many details himself.

==Armorials==
James Bentham wrote in 1771 concerning the arms of Bishop Morton:
&quot;The Arms given him in &quot;Anglia Sacra&quot;, p. 673, are not sufficiently explicit; they should be thus blasoned: &quot;Quarterly gules and ermine on the 1st and 4th a goat&#x27;s head erased argent&quot;. And this agrees with his arms carved various times on the noble Tower of Wisbeche Church, and as they were formerly in a window of Linton Church in Cambridgeshire, as I have it in a manuscript of church notes taken above a century ago. However these accord not with those for our bishop in his own cathedral twice, viz. in the east window of the north aisle of the presbytery, and in another window of the same aisle, where they are still remaining, and are thus blasoned: &quot;Quarterly gules and ermine, on the 1st and 4th three goat&#x27;s heads erased argent, attired or&quot;.

==In popular culture==

In the 1972 BBC television series &quot;The Shadow of the Tower&quot;, which focused on the reign of Henry VII, Morton was played by Denis Carey. In the Netflix/Canal series &quot;Borgia&quot;, Morton appears in one scene in season 2, episode 4, and is portrayed by David Gant. In the Starz miniseries &quot;The White Princess&quot;, Morton is portrayed by Kenneth Cranham.

<doc id="40217" wikidata="Q2585178" url="?curid=40217" title="Niccolò de Romanis">
<text>Niccolò de Romanis (died 1218) was an Italian cardinal and Papal legate. He was Bishop of Frascati from either 1204 or 1205 and Grand penitentiary. He was closely associated with Pope Honorius III as administrator and diplomat. Dean of the College of Cardinals from 1211.

==Legate to England==
In 1207, Pope Innocent III placed the kingdom of England under an Interdict as the result of actions taken by King John (1199–1215) culminating in a debate over the appointment for a successor to the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Interdict would stand until 1213 when John finally accepted Innocent&#x27;s choice of Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury. Nicholas acted as Innocent&#x27;s main negotiator throughout the Interdict, arriving in September 1213 in order to settle its lifting.

He deposed the corrupt Roger Norreys at Evesham Abbey, and finally at Penwortham Abbey. He also intervened at Bardney Abbey to depose the abbot, and put out Ralph de Arundel, abbot of Westminster.

He attempted to mediate between John and his barons, taking up the issue of sheriffs, and trying to fulfil his papal brief to calm factions.

===At Oxford===
During the time the Interdict was in effect, a scholar at Oxford was accused in 1209 of raping a woman. When the burghers couldn&#x27;t find the scholar, they hanged three of his friends in retaliation for his crime. The school at Oxford protested by abandoning the city and scattering to other schools throughout England, possibly setting up a facility in Cambridge.

On 1 October 1213, while Nicholas de Romanis was working to bring about the end of the Interdict, the citizens of Oxford sent him a letter asking him to resolve their problems with the scholars who had taught there. de Romanis agreed to help, visiting the city twice, in November 1213 and May 1214. On 20 June 1214 de Romanis&#x27;s actions resulted in the issuance of the Charter for the University of Oxford.

Among other items, the citizens agreed to charge fixed rates for student housing and food, an annual payment to the school, the right of the school to judge anyone associated with the school and the creation of a Chancellor for the University.

<text>Richard Joseph Daley (May 15, 1902 – December 20, 1976) was an American politician who served as the mayor of Chicago from 1955, and the chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party from 1953, until his death. He has been called &quot;the last of the big city bosses&quot; who controlled and mobilized American cities. He was the patriarch of a powerful Chicago political family. His son, Richard M. Daley, would also go on to serve as mayor of Chicago and another son, William M. Daley, served as the United States Secretary of Commerce and White House Chief of Staff.

Daley was Chicago&#x27;s third consecutive mayor from the working-class, heavily Irish American South Side neighborhood of Bridgeport, where he lived his entire life. He is remembered for doing much to save Chicago from the declines that other Rust Belt cities, such as Cleveland, Buffalo, and Detroit, experienced during the same period. He had a strong base of support in Chicago&#x27;s Irish Catholic community and was treated by national politicians such as Lyndon B. Johnson as a pre-eminent Irish American, with special connections to the Kennedy family. Daley played a major role in the history of the Democratic Party, especially with his support of John F. Kennedy in the presidential election of 1960 and of Hubert Humphrey in the presidential election of 1968. He would be the longest-serving mayor in Chicago history until his record was broken by his son Richard M. Daley in 2011. He has been ranked by some historians as among the ten best mayors in American history.

On the other hand, Daley&#x27;s legacy is complicated by criticisms of his response to the Chicago riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and his handling of the notorious 1968 Democratic National Convention held in his city. During his tenure, he also had enemies within the Democratic Party. In addition, many members of Daley&#x27;s administration were charged and convicted for corruption, although Daley himself was never charged with any crime.

==Early life==
Richard J. Daley was born in Bridgeport, a working-class neighborhood of Chicago. He was the only child of Michael and Lillian (Dunne) Daley, whose families had both arrived from the Old Parish area, near Dungarvan, County Waterford, Ireland, during the Great Famine. Richard&#x27;s father was a sheet metal worker with a reserved demeanor. Michael&#x27;s father, James E. Daley, was a butcher born in New York City, while his mother, Delia Gallagher Daley, was an Irish immigrant. Richard&#x27;s mother was outgoing and outspoken. Before women obtained the right to vote in 1920, Lillian Daley was an active suffragette, participating in marches and often bringing her son to them. She hoped her son&#x27;s life would be more professionally successful than that of his parents. Before his mother&#x27;s death, Daley had won the Democratic nomination for Cook County sheriff. Lillian wanted more than this for her son, telling a friend, &quot;I didn&#x27;t raise my son to be a policeman.&quot; Daley would later state that his wellsprings were his religion, his family, his neighborhood, the Democratic Party, and his love of the city.

===Education===
Daley attended the elementary school of his parish, Nativity of Our Lord, and De La Salle Institute (where he learned clerical skills) and took night classes at DePaul University College of Law to earn a Bachelor of Laws in 1933. As a young man, Daley&#x27;s jobs included selling newspapers and making deliveries for a door-to-door peddler; he worked in Chicago&#x27;s Union stock yards to pay his law school expenses. He spent his free time as a member of the Hamburg Athletic Club, an athletic, social, street gang and political organization near his home. Hamburg and similar clubs were funded, at least in part, by local Democratic politicians. Daley made his mark there, not in sports, but in organization as the club manager. At age 22, he was elected president of the club and served in that office until 1939. Although he practiced law with partner William J. Lynch, he dedicated the majority of his time to his political career.

==Political career==
===Early career===

Daley&#x27;s career in politics began when he became a Democratic precinct captain. Having served as secretary for previous County Treasurers Joseph B. McDonough, Thomas D. Nash, Robert M. Sweitzer, and Joseph L. Gill, he was appointed the Chief Deputy Comptroller of Cook County on December 17, 1936, to replace Michael J. O&#x27;Connor, who had died on December 9.

Daley&#x27;s first elective office was in the Illinois House of Representatives, to which he was elected for the 9th district on November 3, 1936, alongside Democratic incumbents William J. Gormley and Peter P. Jezierny. Despite being a lifelong Democrat, he was elected to the office as a Republican. This was a matter of political opportunism and the peculiar setup for legislative elections in Illinois at the time, which allowed Daley to take the place on the ballot of the recently deceased Republican candidate David Shanahan. Daley&#x27;s name was not printed on the ballot due to the closeness of Shanahan&#x27;s death to the election, but he was able to defeat Shanahan&#x27;s friend Robert E. Rodgers.
After his election, Daley quickly moved back to the Democratic side of the aisle. After the death of incumbent Democratic Senator Patrick J. Carroll in 1938, Daley was elected to the Illinois Senate. That year Gormley and Jezierny were successfully reelected with Republican William S. Finucane taking the third spot. In 1939, Illinois State Senator William &quot;Botchy&quot; Connors remarked of Daley: &quot;You couldn&#x27;t give that guy a nickel, that&#x27;s how honest he is.&quot; Daley served as Minority Leader of the Illinois Senate from 1941 through 1946. He suffered his only political defeat in 1946, when he lost a bid to become Cook County sheriff.

In the late 1940s, Daley became Democratic Ward Committeeman of the 11th Ward, a post he retained until his death. He was appointed by Governor Adlai Stevenson II as head of the Illinois Department of Finance, serving in that role from 1949 through 1950, the year he made a successful run for Cook County Clerk. Daley held that position until being elected Chicago&#x27;s mayor.

Daley became chairman of the Central Committee of the Cook County Democratic Party, i.e., boss of the political machine, in 1953. Holding this position along with the mayoralty in later years enhanced Daley&#x27;s power. A recorded phone conversation that Daley had with President Lyndon Johnson on January 27, 1968, revealed that despite his Irish Catholic background, Daley also privately had at times tense relations with the Kennedy family and that he had declined an offer to vote against President Harry Truman when he was serving as a delegate at the 1948 Democratic National Convention.

===Early mayoralty===
Daley was first elected mayor, Chicago&#x27;s 48th, in 1955. He was reelected to that office five times and had been mayor for 21 years at the time of his death. During his administration, Daley dominated the political arena of the city and, to a lesser extent, that of the entire state. Officially, Chicago has a &quot;weak-mayor&quot; system, in which most of the power is vested in the city council. However, Daley&#x27;s post as de facto leader of the Chicago Democratic Party allowed him to rule the city with an iron hand and gave him great influence over the city&#x27;s ward organizations, which in turn allowed him a considerable voice in Democratic primary contests—in most cases, the real contest in the Democratic stronghold of Chicago.

In 1959 and 1960, Daley served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

Daley contributed to John F. Kennedy&#x27;s narrow, 8,000 vote victory in Illinois in 1960.

Major construction during Daley&#x27;s terms in office resulted in O&#x27;Hare International Airport, the Sears Tower, McCormick Place, the University of Illinois at Chicago, numerous expressways and subway construction projects, and other major Chicago landmarks. O&#x27;Hare was a particular point of pride for Daley, with he and his staff regularly devising occasions to celebrate it. It occasioned one of Daley&#x27;s numerous clashes with community organizer Saul Alinsky. His black-neighborhood Woodlawn Organization threatened a mass &quot;piss in&quot; at the airport (a crowding of its toilets) to press demands for open employment.

Daley&#x27;s construction of a modern Chicago rested on the commitment to racial segregation. Housing, highways, and schools were built to serve as barriers between white and black neighborhoods. To revitalize downtown Chicago Daley worked together with business leaders to push out poor black residents and replace them with middle class whites. To prevent black people from moving into white neighborhoods, Daley oversaw the building of public housing in the form of high-rise towers like the Robert Taylor Homes that he placed within Chicago&#x27;s black ghettos. Many were located along a single street in the ghetto of Chicago&#x27;s South Side, which became known as the &quot;State Street Corridor&quot; and had the densest concentration of public housing in the nation. Daley was also responsible for routing the Dan Ryan Expressway along the neighborhood&#x27;s traditional racial divide, so that it separated the State Street Corridor from the white neighborhoods of the South Side. Until the late 1960s, in municipal elections Daley nevertheless enjoyed 70 percent support within the black community. Like other ethnic groups in Chicago, black voters offered party loyalty and votes for political patronage.

From late 1965 to early 1967 Mayor Daley was confronted by the Chicago Freedom Movement to improve conditions in the black ghettos. On the one hand, the Chicago civil rights movement formed to fight for better schools. On the other hand, it advocated open housing in Chicago. The campaign, that became known as the Chicago Freedom Movement, was led by Martin Luther King Jr., who tried to employ the tactics of peaceful marches like he had in the South. Daley, with the help of black political leaders who did not want to break with Daley&#x27;s political machine and the local press, avoided violent confrontations. In mid-August 1966 the &quot;Summit Agreement&quot; was achieved through a series of meetings. Among other things it brought about the creation of the &quot;Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities&quot;. While this is a contentious issue, the Chicago Freedom Movement is widely considered a failure or at best a draw.

Daley discouraged motion picture and television filming on location in Chicago, after an episode of &quot;M Squad&quot; (aired on January 30, 1959) depicted an officer of CPD taking bribes. This policy lasted until the end of his term and would be reversed under later mayor Jane Byrne, when &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; was filmed in Chicago. However during his time in office, movies including &quot;Cooley High&quot;, and others were filmed in Chicago.

===1968 and later career===
The year 1968 was a momentous year for Daley. On January 27, Daley informed President Johnson that Robert Kennedy had met him and asked for his support in the upcoming Democratic primaries, which he declined. He also got the President to accept an offer to either stay in the Democratic primaries or be nominated as Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s Vice President at the Democratic National Convention. Daley and Johnson were also going to use Kennedy&#x27;s run for president to help this plan and feed Kennedy&#x27;s ego by making him think there was a &quot;revolution&quot; in the party as well. In April, many castigated Daley for his sharp rhetoric in the aftermath of rioting that took place after King&#x27;s assassination. Displeased with what he saw as an over-cautious police response to the rioting, Daley chastised police superintendent James B. Conlisk and subsequently related that conversation at a City Hall press conference as follows:


This statement generated significant controversy. Jesse Jackson, for example, called it &quot;a fascist&#x27;s response&quot;. Daley later backed away from his words in an address to the City Council, saying:

Later that month, Daley asserted,

Robert Kennedy was also assassinated in June 1968, thus hurting Daley&#x27;s earlier plan to make Johnson, who withdrew his re-election bid in March, Vice President.

In August, the 1968 Democratic National Convention was held in Chicago. Intended to showcase Daley&#x27;s achievements to national Democrats and the news media, the proceedings during the convention instead garnered notoriety for the mayor and city, descending into verbal outbursts between participants, and a circus for the media. With the nation divided by the Vietnam War and with the assassinations of King and Kennedy earlier that year serving as backdrop, the city became a battleground for anti-war protesters who vowed to shut down the convention. In some cases, confrontations between protesters and police turned violent, with images of the chaos broadcast on national television. Later, anti-war activists Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and three other members of the &quot;Chicago Seven&quot; were convicted of crossing state lines with the intent of inciting a riot as a result of these confrontations, though the convictions were overturned on appeal.

At the convention itself, Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff went off-script during his speech nominating George McGovern, saying, &quot;And with George McGovern as President of the United States, we wouldn&#x27;t have to have Gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago. And with George McGovern as president, we wouldn&#x27;t have to have a National Guard.&quot; Ribicoff, with his voice shaking, then said: &quot;How hard it is to speak the truth, when we know the problems that are facing this nation&quot;, for which some in the crowd booed Ribicoff. Ribicoff also tried to introduce a motion to shut down the convention and move it to another city. Many conventioneers applauded Ribicoff&#x27;s remarks, but an indignant Daley tried to shout down the speaker. As television cameras focused on Daley, lip-readers later said they observed him shouting, &quot;Fuck you, you Jew son of a bitch, you lousy motherfucker, go home!&quot; Defenders of the mayor later stated that he was calling Ribicoff a faker, a charge denied by Daley and refuted by Mike Royko&#x27;s reporting. A federal commission, led by local attorney and party activist Dan Walker, investigated the events surrounding the convention and described them as a &quot;police riot&quot;. Daley defended his police force with the following statement, which was also a slip of the tongue: &quot;The confrontation was not caused by the police. The confrontation was caused by those who charged the police. Gentlemen, let&#x27;s get this thing straight, once and for all. The policeman is not here to create disorder. The policeman is here to preserve disorder.&quot;

Public opinion polls conducted after the convention demonstrated that the majority of Americans supported Daley&#x27;s tactics. Daley was historically re-elected for the fifth time in 1971. However, many have argued this was due to a lack of formidable opposition rather than Daley&#x27;s own popularity. Democratic nominee McGovern threw Daley out of the 1972 Democratic National Convention, replacing his delegation with one led by Jesse Jackson. This event arguably marked a downturn in Daley&#x27;s power and influence within the Democratic Party but given his public standing, McGovern later made amends by putting Daley loyalist (and Kennedy in-law) Sargent Shriver on his ticket. In January 1973, former Illinois Racing Board Chairman William S. Miller testified that Daley had &quot;induced&quot; him to bribe Illinois Governor Otto Kerner.

In the 1970 special election deciding whether or not Illinois would adopt its then-proposed state constitution, Daley came out in support of its adoption late in the campaign. His support may have ultimately been critical in influencing Illinois voters in their decision to ultimately adopt the proposed constitution. Daley was a strong proponent of Illinois having home rule for local government, and this constitution enshrined the ability for local governments to become home rule units.

Daley was reelected mayor for a (then-record) sixth term in 1975.

==Death and funeral==
Shortly after 2:00 p.m. on December 20, 1976, Daley collapsed on the city&#x27;s Near North Side while on his way to lunch. He was rushed to the office of his private physician at 900 North Michigan Avenue. It was confirmed that Daley had suffered a massive heart attack and he was pronounced dead at 2:55 p.m.; he was 74 years old.

Daley&#x27;s funeral took place on December 22 at Nativity of Our Lord Catholic Church, Chicago, the church that he had attended since his childhood. Attending his funeral were Jimmy Carter (the U.S. president-elect) and vice president Nelson Rockefeller. Daley is buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Worth Township, southwest of Chicago.

After a several-days-long dispute over who would become Chicago&#x27;s acting mayor, a deal was brokered that resulted in Michael A. Bilandic being appointed acting mayor by the city council. Similtaneously, George W. Dunne (the president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners) was chosen to be Daley&#x27;s successor as chair of the Cook County Democratic Party.

==Personal life and family==
Daley met Eleanor &quot;Sis&quot; Guilfoyle at a local ball game. He courted &quot;Sis&quot; for six years, during which time he finished law school and was established in his legal profession. They were married on June 17, 1936, and lived in a modest brick bungalow at 3536 South Lowe Avenue in the heavily Irish and Polish neighborhood of Bridgeport, a few blocks from his birthplace. They had three daughters and four sons, in that order. Their eldest son, Richard M. Daley, was elected mayor of Chicago in 1989, and served in that position until his retirement in 2011. The youngest son, William M. Daley, served as White House Chief of Staff under President Barack Obama and as US Secretary of Commerce under President Bill Clinton. Another son, John P. Daley, is a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. The other progeny has stayed out of public life. Michael Daley is a partner in the law firm Daley &amp; George, and Mary Carol (Daley) Vanecko is a teacher, as were Patricia (Daley) Martino, who died in 2024, and Eleanor, who died in 1998.

===Speaking style===
Daley, who never lost his blue-collar Chicago accent, was known for often mangling his syntax and other verbal gaffes. Daley made one of his most memorable verbal missteps in 1968, while defending what the news media reported as police misconduct during that year&#x27;s violent Democratic convention, stating, &quot;Gentlemen, get the thing straight once and for all – the policeman isn&#x27;t there to create disorder, the policeman is there to &quot;preserve&quot; disorder.&quot; Daley&#x27;s reputation for misspeaking was such that his press secretary Earl Bush would tell reporters, &quot;Write what he means, not what he says.&quot;

==Legacy==
A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago saw Daley ranked as the fifth best American big-city mayor to serve between the years 1820 and 1993. The survey also saw Daley ranked the best big-city mayor to serve in office post-1960. On the 50th anniversary of Daley&#x27;s first 1955 swearing-in, several dozen Daley biographers and associates met at the Chicago Historical Society. Historian Michael Beschloss called Daley &quot;the pre-eminent mayor of the 20th century&quot;. Robert Remini pointed out that while other cities were in fiscal crisis in the 1960s and 1970s, &quot;Chicago always had a double-A bond rating.&quot; According to Chicago folksinger Steve Goodman, &quot;no man could inspire more love, more hate&quot;.

Daley, through his political patronage and role as a political boss, helped advance the political careers of multiple Chicagoans. Notable protégés included Michael A. Bilandic, Jane Byrne, Neil Hartigan, and Edward Hanrahan.

Daley&#x27;s twenty-one-year tenure as mayor is memorialized in the following public buildings:

* A week after his death, the former William J. Bogan Junior College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago, was renamed as the Richard J. Daley College in his honor.
* The Richard J. Daley Center (originally, the Chicago Civic Center) is a 32-floor office building completed in 1965 and renamed for the mayor after his death.
* The Richard J. Daley Library, the primary academic library at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
* The Richard J. Daley Branch of the Chicago Public Library in Bridgeport, Daley&#x27;s home community, dedicated February 1, 1989.

Journalists Adam Cohen and Elizabeth Taylor argue that Daley&#x27;s politics may have saved Chicago from the same fate that cities like Detroit, Kansas City, Saint Louis and Cleveland endured, which suffered from suburbanization, crime and white flight. &quot;But for every middle-class neighborhood he saved, there was a poor neighborhood in which living conditions worsened. For every downtown skyscraper that kept jobs and tax dollars in the city, there was a housing project tower that confined poor people in an overcrowded ghetto&quot;.

Daley was known by many Chicagoans as &quot;Da Mare&quot; (&quot;The Mayor&quot;), &quot;Hizzoner&quot; (&quot;His Honor&quot;), and &quot;The Man on Five&quot; (his office was on the fifth floor of City Hall). Since Daley&#x27;s death and the subsequent election of son Richard as mayor in 1989, the first Mayor Daley has become known as &quot;Boss Daley&quot;, &quot;Old Man Daley&quot;, or &quot;Daley Senior&quot; to residents of Chicago.

During the civil rights era, some black Chicagoans referred to Daley as &quot;Pharaoh&quot;, comparing him to the oppressive and unrelenting figure in the Book of Exodus. These claims were supported by Daley&#x27;s role in the assassination of Fred Hampton and his anti-MLK stance.

==In popular culture==

* The Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young song &quot;Chicago&quot; (written by Graham Nash) was about the 1968 Democratic convention. In their live album &quot;4 Way Street&quot;, Nash ironically dedicates the song to &quot;Mayor Daley&quot;.
* The first verse Steve Goodman&#x27;s original 1972 version of &quot;The Lincoln Park Pirates&quot; contains the line, &quot;the stores are all closing and Daley is dozing&quot;. Following Daley&#x27;s death, Goodman replaced the reference with &quot;... and Bilandic&#x27;s been chosen&quot;. Goodman also wrote and recorded a song called &quot;Daley&#x27;s Gone&quot;, which appeared on his 1977 album &quot;Say It in Private&quot;.
* Songwriters Tom Walsh, Tom Black and Terry McEldowney pay homage to Daley in &quot;South Side Irish&quot;, making him the subject of the entire third verse.
* In episode 13 of the third season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, a sketch entitled &quot;Miracle in Chicago&quot; portrays Mayor Daley (played by John Belushi) appearing as a ghost to a pub owner and a customer (played respectively by Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray). Daley has come back to give the new Mayor a few electoral tips and complain about his burial site. Before disappearing again, he helps the owner get the popular Irish song &quot;Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral&quot; on his juke box and leaves him a gift turkey.
* In a scene set at the Chez Paul restaurant in the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, the maître d&#x27;hôtel (Alan Rubin) is seen talking on the phone: &quot;No, sir, Mayor Daley no longer dines here, sir. He&#x27;s dead, sir.&quot; Later in the film, when the brothers are driving rapidly through Chicago, Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) comments &quot;If my estimations are correct, we should be very close to the Honorable Richard J. Daley Plaza&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s where they got that Picasso!&quot; Jake enthuses. The classic &quot;use of unnecessary violence in the apprehension of the Blues Brothers has been approved&quot; line delivered by a police dispatcher is an obvious homage to Daley&#x27;s 1968 order during the riots following Martin Luther King&#x27;s assassination.

<text>Richard Michael Daley (born April 24, 1942) is an American politician who served as the 54th mayor of Chicago, Illinois, from 1989 to 2011. Daley was elected mayor in 1989 and was reelected five times until declining to run for a seventh term. At 22 years, his was the longest tenure in Chicago mayoral history, surpassing the 21-year mayoralty of his father, Richard J. Daley.

As Mayor, Daley took over the Chicago Public Schools, developed tourism, oversaw the construction of Millennium Park, increased environmental efforts and the rapid development of the city&#x27;s central business district downtown and adjacent near North, South and West sides. He also approved expansion of city workers&#x27; benefits to their partners regardless of gender, and advocated for gun control.

Daley received criticism when family, personal friends, and political allies disproportionately benefited from city contracting. He took office in a city with regular annual budget surpluses and left the city with massive structural deficits. His budgets ran up the largest deficits in Chicago history. A national leader in privatization, he temporarily reduced budgetary shortfalls by leasing and selling public assets to private corporations, but this practice removed future sources of revenue, contributing to the city&#x27;s near insolvency at the end of his tenure. Police brutality was a recurring issue during his mayorship.

== Early and personal life ==
Richard M. Daley is the fourth of seven children and eldest son of Richard J. and Eleanor Daley, who later became Mayor and First Lady of Chicago in 1955. Born on April 24, 1942, he grew up in Bridgeport, a historically Irish-American neighborhood located on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. Daley is a brother of William M. Daley, former White House Chief of Staff and former United States Secretary of Commerce under President Bill Clinton; John P. Daley, a commissioner on the Cook County Board of Commissioners and chairman of the Board&#x27;s Finance Committee; and Michael Daley, an attorney with Daley &amp; Georges, a law firm founded by their father Richard J. Daley, that specializes in zoning law and is often hired by developers to help get zoning changes through city hall. Daley was married to Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Corbett until her death on Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 2011 after a decade-long battle with metastatic breast cancer, which had spread to her bones and liver. Maggie Daley Park in the Chicago Loop commemorates her, and her nonprofit After School Matters continues to serve Chicago&#x27;s young people. They have four children: Nora, Patrick, Elizabeth and Kevin, all born at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago. Their second son, Kevin, died at age two of complications from spina bifida in 1981. Daley was raised Roman Catholic.

Daley graduated from De La Salle Institute high school in Chicago and obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree from DePaul University in 1964, having transferred from Providence College in Providence, Rhode Island after two years. In 1962, at age 19, home on Christmas break, Daley was ticketed for running a stop sign at Huron and Rush, and the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; headline was &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Son Gets Ticket, Uses No Clout,&quot; with a subhead reading &quot;Quiet Boy.&quot;

Sources conflict on Daley&#x27;s military record. The only book-length biography of Daley makes no mention of military service. A 1995 profile in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; stated that Daley served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve from 1961 to 1967, while a 1996 profile in &quot;People Magazine&quot; cited 1960 to 1964. A civilian website for Marines and their families found no military record for Daley.

Daley earned a Juris Doctor degree from DePaul University. He passed the Illinois Bar Examination on his third try. Daley later reflected, &quot;I flunked the bar exam twice. I had to keep studying harder and harder and harder. I passed it the third time.&quot; Daley never tried a case.

== Early political career ==
Daley was elected to his first office as a delegate to the 1969 Illinois Constitutional Convention, which created the current Constitution of Illinois (adopted after voters approved it in a 1970 special election). According to journalist Rick Perlstein, in June 1972, Daley led a mob on behalf of his father&#x27;s Democratic Party regulars against pro-McGovern reformers meeting in a church in Illinois&#x27; Fifth Congressional District. The action was unsuccessful and the reformers&#x27; slate (which included Rev. Jesse Jackson) replaced the Daley slate at the Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida.

After his father died in 1976, Daley succeeded his father as the 11th Ward Democratic committeeman, a party post, until succeeded in the post by his brother John P. Daley in 1980. With John P. Daley holding the post from 1980 to the present, a Daley has held the post of 11th Ward Committeeman for 60 years.

=== Illinois State Senate (1972–1980) ===
After Edward Nihill stepped down, Daley, with the support of the Democratic political organization, was elected to the Illinois Senate, serving from 1972 to 1980. State Senator Daley rarely spoke to reporters and didn&#x27;t hold a news conference for six years. Daley chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee. Daley was named one of Illinois&#x27; ten worst state legislators by &quot;Chicago Magazine&quot; &quot;for arrogance, for sharklike qualities, for living off his father&#x27;s name, and for pulling puppet strings attached to some of the worst members of the Senate.&quot; He was considered &quot;too shrewd to be one of the worst, but he controls so many of the worst senators that he belongs on the list to represent all of them.&quot; After the Spring 1975 state legislative session, Chicago Democrat Dawn Clark Netsch, who served with Daley as Illinois Constitutional Convention delegates and as State Senators, blamed &quot;dirty little Richie&quot; for frustrating her good government legislative agenda in the state legislature.

=== Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney (1981–1989) ===
In 1980, Daley challenged incumbent Republican Bernard Carey for Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney. Democratic Mayor Jane Byrne endorsed Alderman Edward M. Burke in the Democratic primary, and after Daley prevailed in the primary, endorsed Carey in the general election. Daley prevailed and served from 1981 to 1989. His election over Carey saw him win by merely sixteen thousand votes, one of the narrowest wins for the Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney election.

==== Police torture reported to Daley, 1982 ====
In February 1982, Andrew Wilson was arrested for the murder of two Chicago police officers. Wilson was taken to Area 2 detective headquarters on the South Side for interrogation under Chicago Police Detective Jon Burge. Dr. John Raba, Medical Director of Cermak Health Services, the prison hospital in the Cook County Hospital system, examined Wilson, determined Wilson had been tortured, and complained in writing to then Chicago Police Superintendent Richard J. Brzeczek:

I examined Mr. Andrew Wilson on February 15 &amp; 16, 1982. He had multiple bruises, swellings and abrasions on his face and head. His right eye was battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he&#x27;d been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.

Brzeczek forwarded the letter to State&#x27;s Attorney Daley. Daley never replied, and charges were never brought against any officers. Daley&#x27;s prosecutors convicted Wilson and his brother Jackie of murder, and Andrew Wilson was sentenced to death. On April 2, 1987, the Illinois Supreme Court overturned the convictions, ruling that Wilson was forced to confess involuntarily after being beaten by police.

=== First campaign for mayor: 1983 challenge to Jane Byrne ===
In November 1982, Daley announced his first campaign for mayor. The candidates in the three-way Democratic primary, which included incumbent Mayor Jane Byrne, a former protégée of his father, and Congressman Harold Washington, held a series of four televised debates. Daley finished third. Many of Richard J.&#x27;s political allies blamed Richard M. for splitting the white vote, enabling Washington to become Chicago&#x27;s first black mayor.

=== Second campaign for mayor: 1989 victory over Eugene Sawyer ===
On November 25, 1987, Mayor Washington died in office of a heart attack. On December 2, 1987, the Chicago City Council appointed Alderman Eugene Sawyer as mayor until a special election for the remaining two years of the term could be held in 1989. Daley announced his candidacy on December 6, 1988, saying

Let&#x27;s face it: we have a problem in Chicago. The name-calling and politics at City Hall are keeping us from tackling the real issues ... I may not be the best speaker in town, but I know how to run a government and how to bring people together.

Rahm Emanuel worked for the Daley campaign as a fundraiser, David Axelrod as campaign strategist, William Daley as chief strategist, and Forrest Claypool as a campaign aide. Among four Daley campaign appearances on a Sunday shortly before the primary was a rally of Polish Highlanders at 4808 S. Archer Ave. In a videotaped television newscast, it appeared that Daley said, &quot;You want a white mayor to sit down with everybody.&quot; Sawyer said he was &quot;shocked.&quot; Daley explained, &quot;It was my standard stump speech. I&#x27;m not maybe the best speaker in town, but I have never used the word [white].&quot; That Friday, the campaign watchdog group CONDUCT censured Daley and commended Sawyer for his &quot;rejection of racially inflammatory comments.&quot;

Daley defeated Sawyer in the primary. In the 1989 general election, Daley faced Republican candidate Edward Vrdolyak, a former Democratic alderman who had opposed Mayor Washington, and Alderman Timothy C. Evans, the candidate of the newly created Harold Washington Party. Daley won the general election on April 4, 1989. Daley was inaugurated as Mayor of Chicago on April 24, 1989, his 47th birthday, at a ceremony in Orchestra Hall.

== Mayor of Chicago (1989–2011) ==
=== First term (1989–1991) ===
Daley presided over the most docile City Council since his father. One of the new mayor&#x27;s first acts was to appropriate the City Council&#x27;s power to approve city contracts, a right aldermen exercised under former Mayors Washington and Sawyer. Daley&#x27;s first budget proposal, the 1990 budget, included $3 billion in spending, $50 million more than 1989, featured a $25 million reduction in the property tax levy, extended Mayor Sawyer&#x27;s hiring freeze, piloted recycling, and privatized the city&#x27;s tow truck fleet. Daley became the first Chicago Mayor to lead Chicago&#x27;s Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade, at the 20th annual parade on Sunday, June 26, 1989. On August 22, 1990, Daley told reporters that &quot;people are getting hurt in drive-by shoot-a-longs.&quot; In December 1990, Amnesty International issued a report &quot;Allegations of Police Torture in Chicago, Illinois&quot; calling for a full inquiry into allegations that some Chicago police officers tortured criminal suspects between 1972 and 1984.

=== Second term (1991–1995) ===
On April 2, 1991, Daley was reelected to a second term (his first full, four-year term), with 70.7% of the vote, over African American civil rights attorney and Appellate Judge R. Eugene Pincham. Questioned about the city&#x27;s rising homicide rate on September 10, 1991, Daley said &quot;The more killing and homicides you have, the more havoc it prevents.&quot;

==== Brawl at Daley home in Michigan ====
On the weekend of March 1–2, 1992, Daley and his wife arranged for 16-year-old son Patrick to stay with relatives while they attended a family event in New York. Patrick told the relatives he was staying with friends, drove his father&#x27;s new sports utility vehicle to the Daley second home in Grand Beach, Michigan and threw a party Saturday night without parental consent or adult supervision. Someone asked two Filipino and two white youths to leave, racial epithets were exchanged, and a fistfight broke out. Patrick retrieved Richard J. Daley&#x27;s shotgun from the house and gave it to his cousin, who was aged 17. A youth was seriously injured when a juvenile struck him in the head with a baseball bat. On Monday a sobbing Mayor Daley read a statement at a City Hall press conference, pausing repeatedly as he tried to maintain his composure,

I am very disappointed, as any parent would be, after his son held a party in their home while his parents were away. I am more deeply distressed for the welfare of the young man who was injured in this fight.

Patrick pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of furnishing alcohol to minors and disturbing the peace and was sentenced to six months&#x27; probation, 50 hours of community service in Grand Beach, fined $1,950 and ordered to pay restitution to his parents for property damage. His cousin pleaded guilty to aiming a firearm without malice and was fined $1,235. Sixteen other youths were charged with juvenile and adult offenses. The injured youth recovered.

=== Third term (1995–1999) ===
Joseph E. Gardner ran against Daley and lost.

Daley took control of the Chicago Public Schools system in 1995 and appointed Paul Vallas. When Vallas left the post to run for governor, Daley chose the relatively obscure Arne Duncan, who later became the U.S. Secretary of Education under Barack Obama, to lead the district. On March 19, 1997, the Chicago City Council adopted the Domestic Partners Ordinance, which made employee benefits available to same-sex partners of City employees. Daley said it was an issue of fairness.

==== Daley&#x27;s floor leader in City Council resigns ====
The first major public corruption scandal of Daley&#x27;s tenure as mayor involved the circumstances of the resignation of his City Council floor leader, Alderman Patrick Huels, in October 1997. Daley, Huels, and another close friend Michael Tadin grew up within two blocks on S. Emerald Avenue in Bridgeport. Huels attended De La Salle Institute, the same high school attended by Daley, his father, and Michael Bilandic. Huels worked for the city&#x27;s Public Works Department as a laborer and tree trimmer, then as an administrative assistant in the Environment Department, and then as a City Council investigator. He answered phones for the 11th Ward Democratic organization, and was its secretary for several years. When Mayor Richard J. Daley died, 11th Ward Alderman Bilandic was named acting mayor, and Huels, then 26, replaced Bilandic as alderman. Huels chaired the council&#x27;s Transportation Committee and became Mayor Richard M. Daley&#x27;s floor leader. In the summer of 2007, in reaction to ongoing indictments and convictions of aldermen, Daley and Huels shepherded a package of ethics reforms through city council. Huels owned a security firm, SDI Security, Inc. along with his wife and his brother, a Chicago police lieutenant. In the mid-1990s, the firm had about 390 full-time employees and was grossing $7 million a year. Huels was president and a director, and Council Finance Committee Chairman Alderman Edward M. Burke (14th) was secretary. Huels and Burke authorized $633,971 in legal consulting fees from their respective Council committees to attorney Michael A. Pedicone, a long-time officer of SDI. In March 1995 the Internal Revenue Service placed a lien on SDI for $326,951 and in June 1996 for $997,382 for failing to pay payroll taxes, including money withheld from its employees&#x27; pay checks.

In 1970, after high school, Tadin went to work for Marina Cartage; within a decade, he owned the company, and over the next 15 years expanded it from 20 trucks to 150. Between 1992 and 1997, the city paid Marina Cartage and another Tadin company $49 million for supplying the city with snow removal and other heavy equipment and operators. Tadin earned millions of dollars by buying land cheaply, then leasing or selling it to the city. Marina Cartage used Huels&#x27; SDI Security services since 1992. In 1995, with Huels&#x27; support, the City Council approved a tax reduction which halved the assessment on a new $4.5 million headquarters and trucking terminal for Marina Cartage at 4450 S. Morgan in Huels&#x27; ward, a tax savings of as much as $80,000 per year. In 1996, with Huels&#x27; support, the City Council approved a $1.1 million direct grant for the construction of the facility. Weeks later, Tadin created a new company which was used to originate a $1.25 million bailout loan to SDI. Daley said Huels &quot;did the right thing resigning&quot; and claimed no knowledge of Huels&#x27; business dealings. &quot;I don&#x27;t get into people&#x27;s private lives. I am not into that,&quot; Daley said. Daley announced an executive order and new ethics legislation, saying:

The goal of this executive order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts. ... There should be a level playing field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me or anyone else in government. ... Under the steps I&#x27;m taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn everything there is to know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official must be prepared to defend every contract on its merits.

=== Fourth term (1999–2003) ===
On February 23, 1999, Daley won reelection to a fourth term with 68.9 percent of the vote over challenger U.S. Congressman Bobby Rush. In August 1999, prompted by police excessive-force incidents in Chicago, New York and other cities, the U.S. affiliate of Amnesty International issued a report &quot;Race, Rights &amp; Brutality: Portraits of Abuse in the USA,&quot; that called on federal officials to better document excessive-force cases and to pursue prosecutions of the officers involved. In October 1999, the organization issued a report &quot;Summary of Amnesty International&#x27;s concerns on police abuse in Chicago&quot; which expressed concerns including improper interrogation tactics, excessive force, shootings of unarmed suspects, and the detention and interrogation of children.

The Duff family formed a janitorial services company, Windy City Maintenance Inc., one month after Daley&#x27;s inauguration. Bruce DuMont, president of the Museum of Broadcast Communications, said that Daley recommended that Dumont&#x27;s wife Kathy Osterman, then director of the Mayor&#x27;s Office of Special Events, award city contracts to Duff family companies. Daley denied steering contracts to the Duffs, and said he would &quot;look into&quot; the allegations, while stopping short of promising to do so, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t promise. That&#x27;s the wrong word to use. You know ... promising, promising. We do look into it, yes.&quot; In September 2003, a federal investigation led to indictments of Patricia Green Duff, her sons John M. Duff and James Duff, and others on charges they won nearly $100 million in city contracts through the city&#x27;s set-aside program by misrepresenting their companies as women- and minority-owned. John M. Duff pleaded guilty to 33 counts of racketeering, fraud and other charges on January 10, 2004. A 1978 state law designed by Illinois Democrats gave the Mayor the power to appoint to fill vacancies in the City Council rather than holding special elections, and by 2002 more than a third of the council&#x27;s 50 aldermen were initially appointed by Daley. The Council became even more of a rubber stamp than in Richard J. Daley&#x27;s terms. In the 18 months from January 12, 2000 to June 6, 2001, only 13 votes in the council were divided, less than one a month. 32 aldermen supported the mayor 90-100% of the time and another 14 80-89% of the time.

=== Fifth term (2003–2007) ===
On February 26, 2003, Daley took 78.5% of the vote to prevail over challenger Reverend Paul Jakes Jr. Daley endorsed same-sex marriage, saying on February 18, 2004, he would have &quot;no problem&quot; with Cook County issuing marriage licenses to gay couples. &quot;Time&quot; magazine in its April 25, 2005 issue named Daley as the best out of five mayors of large cities in the United States, and characterized Daley as having &quot;imperial&quot; style and power. In May 2006, in Geneva, Switzerland the United Nations Committee Against Torture released a report which noted the &quot;limited investigation and lack of prosecution&quot; into allegations of torture in Areas 2 and 3 of the Chicago Police Department and called on American authorities to &quot;promptly, thoroughly and impartially&quot; investigate the allegations, and provide the committee with more information. Daley was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame in 2006 as a Friend of the Community.

==== Daley orders demolition of Meigs Field ====

A long-standing agreement between the city and state required the city to maintain and operate Meigs Field, a small, downtown, lakefront airport on Northerly Island used by general aviation aircraft and helicopters, until 2011 or turn it over to the state. On September 12, 1996, the City Council approved Daley&#x27;s plan to convert the airport into a park, and the state began planning to take over operation of the airport. Fresh off a 2003 re-election mandate, one of Daley&#x27;s first major acts was ordering the demolition of Meigs Field. On Sunday, March 30, 2003, shortly before midnight, transport trucks carrying construction equipment moved onto Meigs with Chicago Police escort. By early Monday morning, city crews excavated six large X&#x27;s into the only runway. The city&#x27;s 50 aldermen, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Homeland Security were not consulted on the plan. The demolition of the runway trapped planes. In the days following, many of those aircraft were able to take off using the taxiway.

&quot;To do this any other way would have been needlessly contentious,&quot; Daley explained at a news conference Monday morning. Daley argued that the airport was a threat to Chicago&#x27;s high-rise cityscape and its high-profile skyscrapers, such as the Sears Tower and the John Hancock Center. Daley criticized the Federal Aviation Administration, saying &quot;Now, think of that; Mickey and Minnie have it. I mean, I can&#x27;t believe that. They get it first before we get it?&quot;, referring to the post-9/11 air space restrictions in place over Orlando, Florida. &quot;The signature act of Richard Daley&#x27;s 22 years in office was the midnight bulldozing of Meigs Field,&quot; according to &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Eric Zorn. &quot;He ruined Meigs because he wanted to, because he could,&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist John Kass wrote of Daley. &quot;The issue is Daley&#x27;s increasingly authoritarian style that brooks no disagreements, legal challenges, negotiations, compromise or any of that messy give-and-take normally associated with democratic government,&quot; the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; editorialized. The Federal Aviation Administration cited the city for failure to comply with federal law requiring thirty-day advance notice to the FAA of plans for an airport closure. The city was fined $33,000, the maximum allowable. The city paid the fine and repaid $1 million in misspent federal airport development grants. Daley defended his actions by claiming that the airport was abandoned, in spite of the fact that the Chicago Fire Department had several helicopters based on the field at the time, in addition to the dozens of private aircraft left stranded.

==== Hired Truck Program scandal ====

The $40 million-a-year Hired Truck program was the biggest scandal of Daley&#x27;s first 15 years as mayor. The Hired Truck Program hired private truck companies to do city work. A six-month investigation by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; resulted in a three-day series of articles in January 2004 that revealed some participating companies were being paid for doing little or no work, had American Mafia connections or were tied to city employees, or paid bribes to get into the program. Between 1996 and 2004, companies in the Hired Truck Program gave more than $800,000 in campaign contributions to various politicians, including Daley, House Speaker Michael Madigan, and Governor Rod Blagojevich; Daley received at least $108,575 and his brother John Daley and his ward organization more than $47,500.

Mark Gyrion, Daley&#x27;s second cousin, was a superintendent of garages for the city&#x27;s Water Management Department, and among his duties was deciding when City-owned trucks should be sold for scrap. Gyrion&#x27;s mother-in-law&#x27;s firm, Jacz Transportation, participated in the Hired Truck Program, receiving about $1 million between 1998 and 2004. Jacz Transportation bought a truck three days after the city sold it to a Franklin Park dealership and then leased it back to the city. Gyrion was accused of failing to disclose his mother-in-law&#x27;s role in the Hired Truck Program and the transfer of the truck. Gyrion was fired and Jacz Transportation was one of 13 truck companies suspended from the Hired Truck program. About 35% of the 70 firms in the program were suspended or referred to the city&#x27;s Inspector General. The program was overhauled in 2004, and phased out in 2005.

==== Daley patronage chief among officials convicted of fraud ====
On July 5, 2006, Robert Sorich, formally, director of the Mayor&#x27;s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and, informally, Daley&#x27;s patronage chief, and Timothy McCarthy, Sorich&#x27;s aide, were each convicted on two counts of mail fraud connected to rigging blue-collar city jobs and promotions. Sorich&#x27;s best friend, former Streets and Sanitation official Patrick Slattery was convicted of one count of mail fraud. A former Streets and Sanitation managing deputy commissioner was found guilty of lying to federal agents about political hiring. Sorich, McCarthy and Slattery lived in the Bridgeport neighborhood in 11th Ward, the Daley family&#x27;s home neighborhood and ward. &quot;I&#x27;ve never known them to be anything but hard working, and I feel for them at this difficult time,&quot; Daley said. &quot;It is fair criticism to say I should have exercised greater oversight to ensure that every worker the city hired, regardless of who recommended them, was qualified and that proper procedures were always followed,&quot; Daley admitted a few days later. Weeks later, David Axelrod, a Democratic political consultant whose clients included Daley, defended patronage in an op-ed in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

==== Daley son concealed city contracting ====
Mayor Daley&#x27;s son Patrick R. Daley was an MBA student at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business working as an unpaid intern at Cardinal Growth, a Chicago venture capital firm, when he profited from two Cardinal Growth ventures formed to win city contracts while concealing his role. Patrick&#x27;s cousin, and Mayor Daley&#x27;s nephew, is Robert G. Vanecko. In June 2003, Patrick and Vanecko formed a Delaware company, MSS Investors LLC, and invested $65,000 each. MSS Investors LLC in turn purchased a 5% stake in Municipal Sewer Services, a Cardinal Growth venture. Patrick and Vanecko failed to disclose their ownership stake in Municipal Sewer Services as required by city ethics ordinances. Brunt Brothers Transfer Inc. was one of the largest black-owned contractors in the Hired Truck program. Municipal Sewer Services partnered with Brunt Brothers Transfer Inc. in their bid for City sewer-inspection contracts. Five months after Patrick and Vanecko became owners, Municipal Sewer Services&#x27; city contract was extended by $3 million, the first of two no-bid contract extensions, totaled an additional 23 months and $4 million. Patrick and Vanecko cashed out their initial investment after about a year as the federal investigation into the Hired Truck program advanced. Patrick and Vanecko got a $13,114 &quot;tax distribution&quot; in December 2004. Patrick, then 29 and a recent University of Chicago MBA graduate, enlisted in the US Army. The day after the Mayor&#x27;s son&#x27;s and nephew&#x27;s hidden involvement in the city contract was disclosed by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Daley spoke at a Chicago police recruit graduation ceremony, then left for Fort Bragg, North Carolina to see his son deployed. Before departing, Mayor Daley read a statement to reporters, his voice cracking, fighting back tears,

I did not know about [Patrick&#x27;s] involvement in this company. As an adult, he made that decision. It was a lapse in judgement for him to get involved with this company. I wish he hadn&#x27;t done it. I know the expectations for elected officials, their families, are very high—rightfully so—especially for me. ... Patrick is a very good son. I love him. Maggie and I are very proud of him. I hope you respect I have nothing more to say on this.

Mayor Daley also said he didn&#x27;t know if there were other city contracts involving the younger Daley. The city&#x27;s Inspector General and federal authorities began investigations in December 2007. Patrick and Vanecko hired criminal defense attorneys. Municipal Sewer Services LLC folded in April 2008. In January 2011, Anthony Duffy, the president of Municipal Sewer Services, was charged with three counts of mail fraud in conjunction with minority-contracting and Jesse Brunt and his company, Brunt Brothers Transfer Inc., were indicted on three counts of mail fraud. Patrick and Vanecko were not charged.

In 2005, Concourse Communications, another Cardinal Growth venture, signed a city contract for airport Wi-Fi service at city-owned O&#x27;Hare and Midway airports. For years, the Daley administration maintained that Patrick had no financial stake in the deal. Concourse disclosed its investors to the city, as required, but Patrick was not reported. Patrick lined up investors for Concourse. On June 27, 2006, nine months after Concourse signed the contract, Concourse was sold at a 33% profit to Boingo Wireless Inc. for $45 million. On June 30, 2006, Patrick received the first of five payments totaling $708,999. On December 3, 2007, shortly after Patrick received the last of those payments, Mayor Daley&#x27;s press secretary, Jacquelyn Heard said Patrick Daley &quot;has no financial interest with the Wi-Fi contract at O&#x27;Hare.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; editorialized, &quot;... the conflict of interest was blatant.&quot;

==== Park Grill contracting scandal ====
 In 2003, an operating company included over 80 investors, including some of Mayor Daley&#x27;s friends and neighbors won, under controversial circumstances, a lucrative contract to operate the Park Grill, the only restaurant in the new Millennium Park. In 2005 Daley criticized the deal, saying that the city wanted to renegotiate the pact. The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; dubbed the Park Grill the &quot;Clout Cafe&quot; and included the contract award process in a year-end review of 2005 Daley administration scandals. The contract was never renegotiated, and after Daley announced he would not seek a seventh term, the owners of the Park Grill sought to sell. Deposed in August 2013 in Mayor Rahm Emanuel&#x27;s administration&#x27;s lawsuit to renegotiate the contract, former Mayor Daley responded &quot;I don&#x27;t recall&quot; 139 times.

==== Long-term leases of public infrastructure ====
In January 2006, Skyway Concession Company, a joint venture between the Australian Macquarie Infrastructure Group and Spanish Cintra Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte S.A., paid the City $1.83 billion for rights to operate the Chicago Skyway and collect tolls for 99 years. The deal was the first of its kind in the U.S. In December 2006, Morgan Stanley paid Chicago $563 million for a 99-year lease of the city&#x27;s parking garages. &quot;I&#x27;m the one who started talking about leasing public assets. No other city has done this in America,&quot; Daley recalled in 2009. Pulitzer Prize-winning commentator George F. Will wrote of the deals in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;,

Unfortunately, Daley&#x27;s theory—that it can be better to get a sum X immediately, rather than getting over many years a sum Y that is substantially larger than X—assumes something that cannot be assumed. It assumes that governments will prudently husband sudden surges of revenue from the lease or sale of assets.

=== Sixth term (2007–2011) ===

On February 6, 2008, the Chicago City Council approved, by a 41–6 vote, an increase in the city&#x27;s real estate transfer tax to fund the Chicago Transit Authority. Presiding over the meeting, Daley harshly chastized the dissenting aldermen. On March 15, 2010, Daley appointed two aldermen on the same day, bringing to 19 the number of alderman initially appointed by Daley.

==== More long-term leases of public infrastructure ====
In September 2008, Chicago accepted a $2.52 billion bid on a 99-year lease of Midway International Airport to a group of private investors, but the deal fell through due to the collapse of credit markets during the 2008–2012 global recession. In 2008, as Chicago struggled to close a growing budget deficit, the city agreed to a 75-year, $1.16 billion deal to lease its parking meter system to an operating company created by Morgan Stanley. Daley said the &quot;agreement is very good news for the taxpayers of Chicago because it will provide more than $1 billion in net proceeds that can be used during this very difficult economy.&quot; The agreement quadrupled rates, in the first year alone, while the hours which people have to pay for parking were broadened from 9 a.m. – 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. – 9 p.m., and from Monday through Saturday to every day of the week. Additionally, the city agreed to compensate the new owners for loss of revenue any time any road with parking meters is closed by the city for anything from maintenance work to street festivals. In three years, the proceeds from the lease were all but spent.

==== Failed Olympic bid ====

In 2007, Daley entered into ten-year contracts with the city&#x27;s labor unions to preclude labor unrest as Chicago launched a bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics. For months in 2009, Daley promoted the economic benefits of the proposal to the city and its corporate community. Many thought the games would be a capstone of Daley&#x27;s career. On October 2, 2009, in a major disappointment for Daley, Chicago was the first of four finalists to be eliminated during selection ceremonies in Copenhagen. According to a March 2011 report from the city&#x27;s Office of the Inspector General,

By signing a 10-year (contract) with the Teamsters (and with over 30 other unions representing city employees), the current administration and City Council unduly hamstrung not only the current management of city government, but the next six years of management as well, a period that extends well beyond the elected terms of the incoming administration and City Council.

==== Gun control ====
&quot;If it was up to me, no one except law enforcement officers would own a handgun. But I understand that&#x27;s impractical,&quot; Daley told attendees at a conference of gun control advocates in Washington, D.C. in 1998, during his third term. Daley was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. On January 17, 2006, during Daley&#x27;s fifth term, at a joint press conference with Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich calling for a statewide ban on semi-automatic assault weapons, Daley said, &quot;If we are really to make the progress that we want, we have to keep the most dangerous weapons that are right here off of our streets.&quot;

The US Supreme Court took up &quot;McDonald v. Chicago&quot;, 561 U.S. 3025, 130 S.Ct. 3020 (2010), which challenged handgun bans in the Chicago and in the neighboring suburb of Oak Park. In May 2010, Daley held a press conference to address gun control and a pending possible adverse decision in &quot;McDonald v. Chicago&quot;. After Mick Dumke, a reporter for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, questioned the effectiveness of the city&#x27;s handgun ban, Daley picked up a rifle with a bayonet from a display table of confiscated weapons and told him, &quot;If I put this up your butt, you&#x27;ll find out how effective it is. Let me put a round up your, you know.&quot; The remark was voted &quot;the stoopidest thing that Mayor Richard Daley the Younger has ever said&quot; in an online poll by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

On June 28, 2010, the US Supreme Court held, in a 5–4 decision in &quot;McDonald v. Chicago&quot;, that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution was incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment, thus protecting the right of an individual to &quot;keep and bear arms&quot; from local governments, and all but declared Mayor Jane Byrne&#x27;s 1982 handgun ban unconstitutional. That afternoon, at a press conference concerning the gun ban, Daley said,

We&#x27;ll publicly propose a new ordinance very soon ... As a city we must continue to stand up ... and fight for a ban on assault weapons ... as well as a crackdown on gun shops ... We are a country of laws not a nation of guns.

Daley called a special meeting of the city council for four days later, and the Council approved a gun control ordinance revised to include city firearms licenses.

==== Daley budget deficits and fund draw-downs ====
Daley came into office in a city with revenue-generating assets, manageable debt and flush pension funds, but he left behind a city with a structural deficit that Mayor-elect Rahm Emanuel estimated at $1.2 billion when under-funded pension funds were included. The Daley administration&#x27;s expenditures exceeded revenues by hundreds of millions of dollars a year. In August 2010, Fitch Ratings downgraded the city&#x27;s bond credit rating, citing the administration&#x27;s use of reserve funds for general operating expenses and under-funding of its pension funds, and noted that the city faced rising fixed operating costs yet lacked plans for new revenue. Wall Street analysts noted that the Daley administration began drawing on the city&#x27;s reserves as early as 2006, before the 2008–2012 global recession. &quot;While there had been sound economic growth in years prior to 2008, there were still sizable fund balance drawdowns in both 2006 and 2007,&quot; Fitch wrote. The city&#x27;s budgets continued to increase even after the recession began, to more than $6 billion a year, and, when under-funded city employee pension funds were included, the city&#x27;s annual deficit exceeded $1 billion. In January 2011, Moody&#x27;s Investors Service downgraded to a &quot;negative&quot; outlook some of the revenue bonds issued for the $15 billion O&#x27;Hare Modernization Program and related infrastructure projects, citing the city&#x27;s plan to postpone repayment of interest and principal on some construction bonds.

In his annual budget address in City Council Chambers on October 15, 2008, Daley proposed a 2009 budget totaling $5.97 billion, including not filling 1,350 vacancies on the 38,000 employee city payroll and $150 million in new revenue from a then-obscure parking meter lease deal to help erase a $469 million budget shortfall. The Daley administration employed an in-house staff of more than 50 public relations officers across City departments at a cost of $4.7 million, and millions more on seven private public relations firms. &quot;It&#x27;s worth it&quot;, Daley said. On the first day of City Council hearings on Daley&#x27;s 2009 budget proposal, several aldermen questioned the administration&#x27;s public relations spending. On November 4, 2008, Jacquelyn Heard, the mayor&#x27;s press secretary, said the city would halt spending on 10 public relations contracts that could have paid as much as $5 million each.

In his annual budget address on October 21, 2009, Daley projected a deficit for 2009 of more than $520 million. Daley proposed a 2010 budget totaling $6.14 billion, including spending $370 million from the $1.15 billion proceeds from the parking meter lease. In his annual budget address on October 13, 2010, Daley projected a deficit for 2010 of $655 million, the largest in city history. Daley proposed a 2011 budget totaling $6.15 billion, including spending all but $76 million of what remained of the parking meter lease proceeds, and received a standing ovation from aldermen.

==== Daley declines to run for seventh term ====
Daley&#x27;s approval rating was at an all-time low of 35% by late 2009. On September 7, 2010, Daley announced that he would not seek a seventh term. &quot;I&#x27;ve always believed that every person, especially public officials, must understand when it&#x27;s time to move on. For me, that time is now,&quot; Daley said. On December 26, 2010, Daley surpassed his father as Chicago&#x27;s longest-serving mayor. Daley chaired his final city council meeting on Wednesday morning, May 11, 2011. His term ended on May 16, 2011, and he was succeeded by Rahm Emanuel.

=== Legacy ===

Daley was supported by Chicago&#x27;s traditionally Republican business community. He came under criticism for focusing city resources on the development of businesses downtown, the North, Near South, and Near West Sides, while neglecting neighborhoods in the other areas of the city; in particular the needs of low-income residents. According to &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Steve Chapman, &quot;Daley lasted 22 years in office partly because he resolved to ingratiate himself with black Chicagoans. He appointed blacks to high positions, stressed his commitment to provide services to all neighborhoods, tore down public housing projects, and pushed reform of the minority-dominated public schools.&quot; Daley focused on Chicago as a tourist destination as opposed to a manufacturing base, improved and expanded parkland, added flower planters along many primary streets, and oversaw the creation of Millennium Park on what had previously been an abandoned train yard. He spearheaded the conversion of Navy Pier into a popular tourist destination. Daley supported immigration reform, and green building initiatives, for which he was presented with an Honor Award from the National Building Museum in 2009 as a &quot;visionary in sustainability.&quot; Chicago avoided some of the most severe economic contractions of other Midwest cities along the Great Lakes such as Detroit and Cleveland.

== Post-mayoral career ==
Days after leaving office, the University of Chicago appointed Daley a &quot;distinguished senior fellow&quot; at the Harris School of Public Policy. The five-year, part-time appointment includes responsibility for coordinating a guest lecture series. Weeks after leaving office, Daley joined the international law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, one of the law firms to which he had awarded no-bid legal work as mayor. Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP had negotiated the city&#x27;s much-criticized long-term lease of its parking meters, parking garages, and the Chicago Skyway. Daley joined an exclusive speakers bureau, the Harry Walker Agency, that pays tens of thousands of dollars an appearance. Daley was on the board of directors of The Coca-Cola Company from 2011 to 2019. Daley is a managing principal of Tur Partners LLC, an investment firm, where Daley&#x27;s son, Patrick Daley, is a principal. &quot;The National Law Journal&quot; included Daley in its 2013 list of &quot;The 100 Most Influential Lawyers in America,&quot; based on &quot;his political connections — the best in Chicago.&quot; In 2022, Daley&#x27;s daughter Nora became chair of the Illinois Arts Council.

In June 2022, Daley was hospitalized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago for a &quot;neurological&quot; illness.

== Recognition ==
In 1999, Daley received the Arbor Day Foundation&#x27;s Lifetime Stewardship Award.

In 2002, Daley received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Frank McCourt. He was the Host of the 2004 International Achievement Summit in Chicago.

In 2017, Daley received the ULI Chicago Lifetime Achievement Award.

<text>Wrigley Field is a ballpark on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois. It is the home ballpark of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Chicago Cubs, one of the city&#x27;s two MLB franchises. It first opened in 1914 as Weeghman Park for Charles Weeghman&#x27;s Chicago Whales of the Federal League, which folded after the 1915 baseball season. The Cubs played their first home game at the park on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. of the Wrigley Company acquired the Cubs in 1921. It was named Cubs Park from 1920 to 1926, before being renamed Wrigley Field in 1927. The stadium currently seats 41,649 people.

In the North Side community area of Lakeview in the Wrigleyville neighborhood, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark and Addison streets to the west and south, and Waveland and Sheffield avenues to the north and east. Wrigley Field is nicknamed &quot;The Friendly Confines&quot;, a phrase popularized by Hall of Fame shortstop and first baseman Ernie Banks. The oldest park in the National League, it is the second-oldest in the majors after Fenway Park (1912), and the only remaining Federal League park. The park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2020.

Wrigley Field&#x27;s features include its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, distinctive wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the red marquee over the main entrance, and the hand-turned scoreboard. The stadium is situated in a primarily residential neighborhood without parking lots, and spectators have views from the rooftops behind the outfield. Additionally, it was the last Major League park to have lights installed for night games, in 1988. From 1921 to 1970, the stadium was also home to the Chicago Bears of the National Football League, and from 1931 to 1938, it was the home of the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals) of the National Football League. The elevation of its playing field is above sea level.

==History==

Baseball executive Charles Weeghman hired his architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the home opener on April 23, 1914. The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds), came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914, and won the league championship in 1915.

In late 1915, Weeghman&#x27;s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000. Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.

In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park Wrigley Field. In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls after seeing the ivy planted at Perry Stadium, Indianapolis.

In June 2024, Wrigley Field announced a multiyear partnership with Invenergy, and their community solar company, Reactivate, to launch clean and renewable energy systems at the park. The agreement will establish the stadium as an &quot;anchor&quot; for community solar projects in Wrigleyville, marking its first ever use of solar power.

===Renovation===
The Ricketts family aggressively pursued a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. During the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, the family revealed the 1060 Project, which called for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years. The proposal was vast and included planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium&#x27;s façade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, moving the bullpens and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza and office-retail complex.

After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city&#x27;s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team planned to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about , including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move that was opposed by many owners of the rooftop clubs surrounding the stadium, who worried that such signage would obstruct their sightlines. Before work on the project began, the team wanted the rooftop owners to agree not to pursue legal action challenging the construction and continued to negotiate privately with them – offering to reduce the size and number of signs to be built – in order to gain their assent. The team could not come to terms with the rooftop owners who had a lease agreement with the team until 2023 in exchange for paying 17% of the gross revenues. In May 2014, the Cubs announced they would pursue the original 2013 plan to modify the park. Over the course of the next three years, the Ricketts family began to purchase many of the rooftop locations.

====1060 Project renovation====
Phase one of the 1060 Project began on September 29, 2014. During the offseason, the bleachers in both outfields were expanded and the stadium&#x27;s footprint was extended further onto both Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. A Jumbotron scoreboard was added to the left field bleachers, topped with a sign advertising Wintrust Financial, a Rosemont-based bank and a Cubs Legacy Partner; the &quot;W&quot; in Wintrust flashes after every Cubs win. A video scoreboard was also added in the right field bleachers, and the parking lots along Clark Street were excavated for underground players&#x27; locker rooms and lounges.

After the close of the extended 2015 season, work began on phase two of the project.

Exterior renovations of the park seek to restore design elements present before the 1960s. These details include ornamental muted-green grill-work and red Ludowici terra cotta roofing.

Phase three of the 1060 Project was completed before the start of the 2017 season. The left and right field bullpens were relocated to enclosed areas under the bleachers, the brick walls were extended toward the field, and new seating was added in the vacated bullpen areas. A visiting team &quot;batting tunnel&quot; was also added. Partial façade replacement and concourse restoration was completed along Addison Street, along with structural improvements to the right field bleachers. The outfield turf was replaced just weeks before the start of the season. The Cubs Plaza building just to the west of Wrigley was finalized, and the &quot;Park at Wrigley&quot;, the area above Cubs players dressing rooms, was in use for fans before and during games. Construction of Hotel Zachary along the west side of Clark Street was ongoing.

The fourth phase of improvements began at the conclusion of the 2017 season. The dugouts were moved farther down the left and right field foul lines to make room for two of the four new luxury clubs. The seating area behind home plate was reconstructed to locate another of the new clubs. The final upper level club was planned for the 2019 season. The Hotel Zachary, just across Clark Street, was open for business in time for the Cubs&#x27; first home game on April 9, 2018.

====National Historic Landmark====
Near the start of the renovations, the Ricketts applied for National Historic Landmark status for Wrigley Field in 2013. A similar plan had been successfully pursued by the owners of Fenway Park in Boston. To achieve landmark status, the renovations had to respect and reflect the historic character of the stadium. The benefit to the owners is that landmark status allows them to claim tax credits for the renovation. National landmark status was awarded in 2020, with the U.S. Secretary of the Interior commenting that &quot;the historical significance of Wrigley Field is interwoven into our nation&#x27;s story and a key part of what has become America&#x27;s beloved pastime for over a century&quot;.

====Firsts since renovation====
On May 26, 2015, Cubs rookie third baseman Kris Bryant became the first to hit the new left field videoscreen with his home run. On October 13, the Cubs clinched a playoff series at home in Wrigley Field for the first time in franchise history, with a 6–4 victory in game four of the 2015 NLDS. After Anthony Rizzo hit what would be the game-winning and series-winning home run in the sixth inning, Kyle Schwarber&#x27;s seventh inning home run ball landed on top of the right field scoreboard. The ball was left in place, encased in clear plexiglass to protect it from the elements, but was removed in 2016.

===100th anniversary===
During the 2014 season, the Cubs celebrated the centennial of Wrigley Field. Each decade was represented during ten homestands throughout the season. April 23, the 100th anniversary of the stadium&#x27;s opening, saw the Cubs playing the Arizona Diamondbacks in a throwback game. Each team represented one of the teams that played in the inaugural game at the stadium. The Cubs wore the uniforms of the Chicago Whales (Federals), the original occupants of the stadium, and the Diamondbacks wore uniforms representing the Kansas City Packers, whom the Federals played on April 23, 1914.

=== Lawsuit ===
On July 14, 2022, the United States government filed a lawsuit against the Chicago Cubs, operator of the stadium, for alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, claiming that the stadium did not accommodate spectators with disabilities, primarily those in wheelchairs. The lawsuit states that, during recent renovations, the stadium operator removed the best wheelchair seating, failed to add wheelchair accessibility to premium club rooms, and stuck the wheelchair seats behind railings, which could obstruct the view of those in wheelchairs. The Chicago Cubs, however, released a statement, saying that &quot;Wrigley Field is now more accessible than it was in its 108-year history&quot;.

==Features==
Wrigley Field follows the jewel box ballpark design that was popular in the early part of the 20th century. The two recessed wall areas, or &quot;wells&quot;, located both in left and right field, give those areas more length than if the wall were to follow the contour from center field. It is also in those wells, when cross winds are blowing, that balls have a habit of bouncing in all directions. In addition, there is a long chain-link fence strip running the entire length of the outfield wall, the base of which is about two feet down from the top of the wall and the top of which projects out at an angle, primarily used to keep fans from interfering with balls in play. Called &quot;the Basket&quot; by players and fans alike, the rules of the field state that any ball landing within the basket is ruled a home run, making the distance to hit a home run in Wrigley Field actually shorter than the location of the outfield wall.

===Ivy-covered outfield walls===

The ballpark&#x27;s outfield walls are covered by ivy. In the first weeks of the baseball season, the ivy has not leafed out, and all that is visible are the vines on which it grows. However, as the baseball season progresses further into spring, the ivy grows thick and green, disguising the hard brick surface of the outfield wall. In the autumn, generally during postseason, the ivy turns red. On April 7, 2013, Total Pro Sports named Wrigley Field the &quot;Best Place to Catch a Game in 2013&quot;, owing the award primarily to its architecture and ivy-coated fields.

In 1937, the stadium was renovated and P. K. Wrigley discussed beautification with then-Cubs President Bill Veeck, who suggested planting ivy on the outfield walls. The ivy was originally English ivy (&quot;Hedera helix&quot;), but was later changed to &quot;Parthenocissus tricuspidata&quot;, commonly called Boston ivy or Japanese ivy, which can endure the harsh Chicago winters better than the former species. Cuttings from the ivy were sold by local vendors. The Cubs attempted to grow the ivy on the outside of Wrigley Field as well, but the plantings were often stolen, so the Cubs abandoned the plans.

Following a later change in MLB rules, which requires all outfield walls to be padded, Wrigley Field was grandfathered into the rules, meaning it is the only stadium in the league without padded walls because of the ivy. In 2004, the ivy was specifically included in Wrigley Field&#x27;s Landmark Designation by the Chicago City Council. Although the ivy appears to &quot;pad&quot; the bricks, it is of little practical use in this regard. There have been occasions of fielders being injured when slamming into the wall while pursuing a fly ball.

Under the ground rules of Wrigley Field, if a baseball gets into the ivy and gets stuck, the batter is awarded a ground rule double. Outfielders often raise their arms up when the ball goes into the ivy, signaling to an umpire to go out and rule on the play. However, if the ball becomes dislodged or the fielder reaches into the vines to try and retrieve it, it is considered in play and the runners can advance.

===Dimensions===

The distances from home plate to various points in the outfield have remained essentially unchanged since the bleachers were remodeled during the 1937 season. They were originally marked by wooden numbers cut from plywood, painted white, and placed in gaps where the ivy was not allowed to grow. Since the early 1980s, the numbers have been painted directly on the bricks, in yellow. Although the power-alley dimensions are relatively cozy, the foul lines are currently the deepest in the major leagues.
It is to the notch in the wall just beyond the left field foul pole. The point where the bleacher wall begins to curve inward in left-center field, one of the two &quot;wells&quot;, is an unmarked . The front part of the left-center &quot;well&quot; is the closest point in the outfield, about . The marked left-center field distance is . It is closer to true center field than its right-center counterpart is. True center field is unmarked and is about . The center field marker, which is to the right of true center field and in the middle of the quarter-circle defining the center field area, is and is the deepest point in the outfield. Right-center field is , the notch of the right-center &quot;well&quot; is an unmarked , and the right field foul line is . As of 2004, the backstop is listed in media sources as behind home plate. Although that distance is standard, the relatively small foul ground area in general gives an advantage to batters. The ivy-covered walls in the left and right field corners were reduced from 15 to 11 feet in height prior to the 2015 season as part of phase one of the 1060 project.  At around the same time, advertising signs above the corners of the left and right field wall were installed, raising the bleachers by about three feet. It is a widespread misconception that the recently added signage are in-play and a part of the wall, neither of which are correct. The distance from where the front row bleachers are to the field, including the newly placed signs, is still 15 feet.

===Rooftop seats===

When Wrigley Field was constructed, the buildings along Waveland and Sheffield avenues gave spectators a view of what was going on inside the ballpark, but did not become popular spectator areas until the 1929 World Series. The 1938 World Series brought paying spectators to the rooftops, however, fans typically sat in lawn chairs and brought their own food and beverages. In the mid-1980s, rooftop owners began to organize more formally as businesses, seeking to extract more revenue by updating the rooftops with bleacher-style grandstands. The Sky Box on Sheffield opened in 1993, originally catering primarily to corporate groups. Today, it is complete with a two-tier roof deck, indoor clubhouse, fully staffed bars on three levels, and an elevator.

In 1998, the city started requiring rooftop owners to have a license and began to regulate the venues. In 2003, relations between rooftop owners and the Cubs worsened when the team put up a large screen to block the view of the rooftops, exemplifying what is known as a spite fence. The Cubs then sued most rooftop businesses that year, claiming they were stealing from the team&#x27;s product and &quot;unjustly enriching themselves&quot;.

In 2004, the building owners agreed to share a portion of their proceeds with the Cubs. Rooftop owners were required to pay the team 17% of their gross revenue in an agreement lasting until 2023. The Cubs obtained permission from the city to expand the ballpark&#x27;s own bleachers out over the sidewalks and do some additional construction on the open area of the property to the west, bordered by Clark and Waveland, and to close the remnant of Seminary Avenue that also existed on the property. The rooftop seats are now effectively part of the ballpark&#x27;s seating area, although they are not included in the seating capacity figure.

In July 2016, former rooftop owner R. Marc Hamid was convicted on nine counts of mail fraud and illegal bank structuring. Hamid had been underreporting attendance at the Sky Box on Sheffield from 2008 to 2011, and covered up over $1 million in revenue while also avoiding hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes and royalties that violated the agreement rooftop owners had with the Cubs. In January 2017, he was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison.

In 2013, the owners threatened suit when the team announced plans to renovate the stadium and potentially disrupt the sight lines. In May 2014, when the rooftop owners did not agree to a scaled down plan for renovations, the Cubs&#x27; owners announced their intentions to implement the original 2013 plan for renovations even if it meant battling the issue in court. Cubs owner Ricketts said Wrigley has &quot;the worst player facilities in Major League Baseball...I am saying it is the time to invest in Wrigley Field and do the things that our competitors do.&quot; By the end of the 2016 season, the Ricketts family had acquired ten of the rooftop locations, with a financial stake in an eleventh.

Some of the rooftops became legendary in their own right. The Lakeview Baseball Club, which sits across Sheffield Avenue (right-field) from the stadium displayed a sign that read &quot;Eamus Catuli!&quot; (roughly Latin for &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Cubs!&quot;—&quot;catuli&quot; translating to &quot;&quot;, the nearest Latin equivalent), flanked by a counter indicating the Cubs&#x27; long legacy of futility. The counter was labeled &quot;AC&quot; for &quot;Anno Catulorum&quot;, or &quot;In the Year of the Cubs&quot;. Prior to the team&#x27;s 2016 championship, it read &quot;AC0871108&quot;, with the first two digits indicating the number of years since the Cubs&#x27; last division championship as of the end of the previous season (2008), the next two digits indicating the number of years since the Cubs won the National League Pennant (1945), and the last three digits indicating the number of years since their last World Series win (). After winning the World Series in 2016, the sign was updated to &quot;AC0000000&quot;.

=== The Yard at Wrigley Field ===
In January 2025, the Cubs announced a new area called &quot;The Yard at Wrigley Field&quot;, which featuring five semi-private rental areas designed to help fans sample the bleachers featuring an exclusive table with unlimited beer, seltzer, wine and non-alcoholic drinks, as well as a ballpark meal for each guest. The area would be accessible up to 90 minutes before the first pitch until the end of the game. The area has a capacity of 50 guests.

===Unusual wind patterns===
In April and May, the wind often comes off Lake Michigan (less than a mile to the east), with a northeast wind &quot;blowing in&quot; to knock down potential home runs and turn them into outs. In the summer, however, or on any warm, breezy day, the wind often comes from the south and the southwest, &quot;blowing out&quot; with the potential to turn normally harmless fly balls into home runs. A third variety is the cross-wind, which typically runs from the left field corner to the right field corner and causes all sorts of havoc. Depending on the direction of the wind, Wrigley can either be one of the friendliest parks in the major leagues for pitchers or among the worst. This makes Wrigley one of the most unpredictable parks in the Major Leagues. Many Cubs fans check their nearest flag before heading to the park on game days for an indication of what the game might be like. This is less of a factor for night games, however, because the wind does not blow as hard after the sun goes down.

With the wind blowing in, pitchers can dominate and no-hitters have resulted. The last two by a Cubs pitcher occurred near the beginning and the end of the 1972 season, by Burt Hooton and Milt Pappas respectively. Not until Cole Hamels of the Philadelphia Phillies no-hit the Cubs in 2015 would another no-hitter be pitched at Wrigley. In the seventh inning of Ken Holtzman&#x27;s first no-hitter, on August 19, 1969, Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves hit a ball that looked headed for the bleachers, but the wind caught it just enough for left fielder Billy Williams to leap up and snare it.

With the wind blowing out, some true tape-measure home runs have been hit by well-muscled batters. Sammy Sosa and Dave &quot;Kong&quot; Kingman broke windows in the apartment buildings across Waveland Avenue several times, and Glenallen Hill put one on a rooftop. Batters have occasionally slugged it into, or to the side of, the first row or two of the &quot;upper deck&quot; of the center field bleachers. Sosa hit the roof of the center field camera booth on the fly during the 2003 NLCS against the Florida Marlins, some away. The longest blast was probably hit by Dave Kingman on a very windy day in 1976, while with the Mets. According to local legend, that day, Kingman launched a bomb that landed on the third porch roof on the east (center field) side of Kenmore Avenue some 550 feet away. No batter has ever hit the center field scoreboard, but it has been struck by a golf ball hit by Sam Snead using a two-iron.

===Hand-turned scoreboard===
The scoreboard was installed in 1937, when Bill Veeck installed the new bleachers. It has remained in place ever since, and has only seen minor technical and cosmetic modifications. The clock was added in 1941, and a fifth row of scores was added to each side in 1961, with a sixth by 1969. A set of light stands facing onto the scoreboard was added in 1988 with the introduction of night games.

Along with Fenway Park&#x27;s scoreboard and Daikin Park, Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Coors Field and Oracle Park&#x27;s out of town scoreboards, Wrigley is one of the last parks to maintain a hand-turned scoreboard. A number turner watches the score changes on a computer (a ticker tape machine was used in the past), and updates the scoreboard by manually replacing the numbers from within the scoreboard. The scoreboard is made of sheet steel. The numbers that are placed into the inning windows are also steel, painted forest green, and numbered with white numerals. The box for the game playing at Wrigley uses yellow numerals for the current inning. The clock, which sits at the top center of the scoreboard, has never lost time in its -year existence.

Standing over the clock are three flagpoles, one for each division in the National League. There are 15 flags, one for each National League team, and their order on the flagpoles reflects the current standings. The entrance to the scoreboard is a trap-door on the bottom. On the reverse of the scoreboard, visible from the CTA elevated trains, is a blue Cubs pennant in white outlined in red neon. The scoreboard was extensively rehabilitated for the 2010 season.

Unlike the home of the Red Sox, the scoreboard at Wrigley is mounted above the centerfield bleachers, rather than at ground level, making it harder to hit during play. No players have hit the current scoreboard, although at least three have come close: Roberto Clemente to the left side on May 17, 1959; and Bill Nicholson and Eddie Mathews to the right on August 22, 1942, and April 22, 1953, respectively.

In 2010, the Cubs considered adding a video screen to the stadium, but the hand-turned scoreboard cannot be moved due to the park&#x27;s landmark status, which also prohibits even simple facelifts, such as adding two more games on either side (there are 15 teams in both the National and American Leagues) of the 12-game, 24-team scoreboard (reflecting the MLB from 1969 to 1976), so up to three games (one NL, one AL and the interleague) each day cannot be posted. Those games may eventually be part of the auxiliary video board currently on the right field that may also be added in left field. Most Cubs players support the concept of a video board, and work on two additional scoreboards began at the end of the 2014 season.

On March 21, 2013, it was announced that Alderman Tom Tunney wanted to demolish the scoreboard to clear the view for nearby residents, who watch games from their rooftops. &quot;Demolishing the landmark old scoreboard has never been part of any plan discussed or envisioned by the Ricketts family,&quot; said Dennis Culloton, a spokesman for Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts. To date, there is a third generation scoreboard operator whose grandfather began working in the hand-turned scoreboard at its inception.

===Main entry marquee===
Directly over the main entrance to the stadium stands a large, red, art deco-style marquee, with &quot;Wrigley Field, Home of Chicago Cubs&quot; painted in white. The marquee was installed in 1934, and was originally painted green with changeable sections to announce upcoming games. By 1939, it was repainted dark blue and the original &quot;Home of the Cubs&quot;, was replaced with &quot;Home of Chicago Cubs&quot;. In years when the Bears played there, the sign was changed appropriately during football season. On March 23, 1960, the Cubs repainted the sign red.

In 1982, a two-line announcement board was replaced with an electronic LED message board, and a backlit advertising panel was added below (this is now solid red). The marquee uses red neon lights at night, showing &quot;Wrigley Field&quot; in red, with the rest of the sign in darkness. A Budweiser Beer slogan was on the lower panel in the early 1980s, around the time when the team added the LED signage. The Chicago Transit Authority Addison street platform that serves Wrigley Field uses an image of the marquee painted on walls to announce the destination. In November 2010, the marquee was painted purple with an Allstate Insurance logo for the Northwestern Wildcats, who played as the home team against the Illinois Fighting Illini in a Big Ten football game.

In 2015, a Toyota emblem was placed on the lower panel just below the LED sign on the marquee; previously, the area was used for logos of transient corporate sponsors and team initiatives. Toyota, one of the team&#x27;s &quot;legacy partners&quot;, began displaying other signage in and around the park in 2016, including branding on all of its parking lots.

The marquee was temporarily removed and restored for the 2016 season, including new paint, a new LED display board, and new neon lights. The back of the sign was given a new green paint job as well, which can now be seen from inside the terrace level.

===Lights===

The Cubs were a holdout against night games for decades, not installing lights at Wrigley until 1988, after baseball officials announced that the park would be prohibited from hosting any future postseason games without lights. Before then, all games at Wrigley were played during the day. Night games are still limited in number by agreement with the city council.

In 1942, then-owner Philip K. Wrigley had planned to install lights, but the equipment was instead diverted for the World War II effort. On July 1, 1943, the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League&#x27;s first midseason All-Star Game was played under temporary lights at Wrigley Field, between two teams composed of South Bend Blue Sox and Rockford Peaches players versus Kenosha Comets and Racine Belles players. It was also the first night game ever played in the ballpark.

The 1984 World Series was scheduled to start in the National League park, but MLB actually had a contingency plan to instead start the Series at the American League park in the event that the Cubs won the NLCS against the San Diego Padres. This would have allowed the Wrigley Field-hosted (i.e. daytime) games to be held over the weekend; in return, only one night game (game 3 on Friday) would have been lost. Had the Cubs advanced to the Series instead of the Padres, the Detroit Tigers would have hosted games 1, 2, 6, and 7 (on Tuesday and Wednesday nights), while the Cubs would have hosted games 3, 4, and 5 (on Friday, Saturday and Sunday), with all three games in Chicago starting no later than 1:30 p.m. CST. Since the Padres wound up winning the 1984 NLCS, these plans proved moot.

In the late 1980s, Cubs management insisted that the team was in danger of leaving Wrigley if lights were not installed, and Major League Baseball threatened to make the Cubs play postseason &quot;home&quot; games at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. After 5,687 consecutive day games played by the Cubs at Wrigley, the lights were finally lit on August 8, 1988, for a game against the Philadelphia Phillies. However, that game was rained out after 3½ innings, and the first official night game took place the following evening against the New York Mets, whom the Cubs beat 6–4.

On November 7, 2022 Wrigley Field upgraded to LED field lights.

==Stadium usage==
===Baseball===
Wrigley Field&#x27;s first tenant was the Federal League team, the Chicago Whales, from 1914 to 1915. It has served as the home baseball park for Major League Baseball&#x27;s Chicago Cubs franchise since 1916.

===Football===

The Chicago Bears of the National Football League played at Wrigley Field for 50 years, from 1921 to 1970 before relocating to Soldier Field. The team had transferred from Decatur, and retained the name &quot;Staleys&quot; for the 1921 season. They renamed themselves the Bears in order to identify with the baseball team, then a common practice in the NFL. Wrigley Field once held the record for the most NFL games played in a single stadium, with 365 regular season games, but this record was surpassed in 2003 by Giants Stadium in New Jersey, thanks to its dual-occupancy by the New York Giants and New York Jets. On September 14, 2003, the game played between the Jets and Miami Dolphins was the 366th regular season NFL game at Giants Stadium, breaking Wrigley&#x27;s regular season record. The 50 seasons the Bears spent at Wrigley Field had been an NFL record until 2006, when Lambeau Field duplicated this feat by hosting the Green Bay Packers for a 50th season and broke it in 2007. Soldier Field also matched the accomplishment when the Bears played there for their 50th season in 2021 and would the break the record when the Bears played their 51st season in the venue in 2022.

Initially, the Bears worked with the stands that were there. Eventually, they acquired a large, portable bleacher section that spanned the right and center field areas and covered most of the existing bleacher seating and part of the right field corner seating. This &quot;East Stand&quot; raised Wrigley&#x27;s football capacity to about 47,000, or a net gain of perhaps 9,000 seats over normal capacity. After the Bears left, this structure would live on for several years as the &quot;North Stand&quot; at Soldier Field, until it was replaced by permanent seating.

The football field ran north-to-south, i.e. from left field to the foul side of first base. The remodeling of the bleachers made for a very tight fit for the gridiron. In fact, the corner of the south end zone was literally in the visiting baseball team&#x27;s dugout, which was filled with pads for safety, and required a special ground rule that sliced off that corner of the end zone. The end zone was also shorter than the north, as the south end zone was eight yards, compared to the regulation ten yards. One corner of the north end line ran just inches short of the left field wall. There is a legend that Bears fullback Bronko Nagurski steamrolled through the line head down, and ran all the way through that end zone, smacking his leather-helmeted head on the bricks. He went back to the bench and told then-coach George Halas, &quot;That last guy gave me quite a lick!&quot; That kind of incident prompted the Bears to hang some padding in front of the wall.

The Bears are second only to the Packers in total NFL championships, and all but one of those (their only Super Bowl championship) came during their tenure at Wrigley. After a half-century, they found themselves compelled to move as the NFL wanted every one of its stadiums to seat at least 50,000 as a result of the then-recent AFL–NFL merger. The Bears held one game at Dyche Stadium (now Ryan Field) on the Northwestern University campus in 1970, but otherwise continued at Wrigley until their transfer to the lakefront ended their five-decade run on the north side.

One remnant of the Bears&#x27; time at Wrigley was uncovered during the offseason rebuilding of the playing field between 2007 and 2008: the foundations for the goal posts. Five NFL championship games were played at Wrigley Field: 1933, 1937, 1941, 1943, and 1963. Coupled with the Chicago Bears, the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals) of the NFL called Wrigley Field home from 1931 to 1938. Born on the South Side of Chicago, the Cardinals also played their home games at Normal Park, Comiskey Park, and Soldier Field.

The Northwestern Wildcats and the Illinois Fighting Illini played a college football game at Wrigley Field on November 20, 2010. It was the first football game at Wrigley Field since 1970, and the first collegiate football game there since 1938, when the DePaul Blue Demons played its regular games at Wrigley. The field used an east–west field configuration (third base to right field). In order to keep the playing field at regulation size, the safety clearances for each end zone to the walls in the field were considerably less than normal. In particular, the east (right field) end zone came under scrutiny as its end zone was wedged extremely close to the right field wall (as close as one foot in some areas), forcing the goal posts to be hung from the right field wall in order to fit. Despite extra padding provided in these locations, it was decided that all offensive plays for both teams play to the west end zone, where there was more safety clearance. The east end zone could still be used on defensive and special teams touchdowns, as well as defensive safeties; and, in fact, there was one interception run back for an eastbound touchdown. Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany said that, as late as three days before the game, he had only been apprised that the situation wasn&#x27;t &quot;anything other than tight&quot;. When he had a chance to fully vet the situation, however, he concluded that the space surrounding the east end zone was smaller than the minimum of six feet stipulated in NCAA rules, and it would have been too great of a risk to allow offensive plays to be run toward that end zone. The Fighting Illini won the game 48–27, taking home the Land of Lincoln Trophy, which was introduced in 2009.

Northwestern football returned to Wrigley Field in 2021 and 2023, and hosted two games at Wrigley Field during stadium reconstruction. During the 2017 offseason, the home (third base) dugout and adjacent seating were redesigned to be portable, and the playing field will accommodate a regulation size 120-yard football field that will run east-west, unlike the Bears, when the stadium was north-south. During most of the Bears&#x27; run in Wrigley Field, the goal posts were located on the goal line as was NFL rules until 1975, not the end line as it was in college and after 1974, the NFL, which made the deeper end zones relevant. A Northwestern football game had also been scheduled for Wrigley in 2020, but was relocated to Northwestern&#x27;s Ryan Field due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a makeup, Northwestern relocated their 2021 home game against Purdue to Wrigley Field, which was held in November. The Wildcats also hosted Iowa in November 2023. The Wildcats hosted Ohio State on November 16, 2024 and the Fighting Illini November 30, 2024.

===Soccer===
The Chicago Sting of the North American Soccer League (NASL) used Wrigley, along with Comiskey Park, for their home matches during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Sting hosted the San Diego Sockers at Wrigley on August 25, 1979, when the Bears were using Soldier Field. Unlike the Bears&#x27; football layout, the soccer pitch ran east to west, from right field to the foul territory on the third base side. Soccer returned to Wrigley Field in July 2012, when Italian club A.S. Roma defeated Poland&#x27;s Zaglebie Lubin 4–0 in a friendly match with 22,181 spectators. A regular season National Women&#x27;s Soccer League match between the Chicago Red Stars and Bay FC was played at Wrigley Field on June 8, 2024. They were the first women&#x27;s teams to play at the stadium since 1943 and broke the league&#x27;s attendance record with 35,038 spectators; the Red Stars lost 2–1.

===Hockey===
On January 1, 2009, the National Hockey League played its 2009 Winter Classic at Wrigley Field, pitting two &quot;Original Six&quot; teams – the host Chicago Blackhawks and the visiting Detroit Red Wings – in an outdoor ice hockey game. The rink ran across the field from first base to third base with second base being covered by roughly the center of the rink. The attendance for this game was 40,818. The Red Wings won 6–4. Wrigley Field also hosted the 2025 NHL Winter Classic on December 31, 2024 between the Chicago Blackhawks and the St. Louis Blues. The attendance for this game was 40,933. The Blues won 6–2.

===Concerts===
Since 2005, Wrigley Field has been opened on a limited basis to popular concerts, but not without some controversy. Local neighborhood groups have expressed concerns about the impact of concert crowds and noise on the surrounding residential neighborhood, particularly in 2009, when three concerts were added to the schedule, one conflicting with an annual neighborhood festival.

==Traditions and mainstays==
===Corporate sponsorship===

Wrigley Field shares its name with the Wrigley Company, as the park was named for its then-owner William Wrigley Jr., the company&#x27;s CEO. As early as the 1920s, before the park became officially known as Wrigley Field, the scoreboard was topped by the elf-like &quot;Doublemint Twins&quot;, posed as a pitcher and a batter. There were also ads painted on the bare right field wall early in the ballpark&#x27;s history, prior to the 1923 remodeling, which put bleachers there. After that, the Doublemint elves were the only visible in-park advertising. The elves were removed permanently in 1937, when the bleachers and scoreboard were rebuilt. It would be about 44 years before in-park advertising would reappear.

Ironically given the roots of its name, Wrigley Field had been a notable exception to the trend of selling corporate naming rights to sporting venues. The Tribune Company, the owners of the park from 1981 to 2009, chose not to rename the ballpark, utilizing other ways to bring in corporate sponsorship. During the mid-1980s, Anheuser-Busch placed Budweiser and Bud Light advertisements beneath the center field scoreboard. Bud Light became the sponsor of the rebuilt bleachers in 2006.

In the early 2000s, following the trend of many ballparks, a green-screen chroma key board was installed behind home plate in the line of sight of the center field camera to allow electronic &quot;rotating&quot; advertisements visible only to TV audiences. By 2006, the board was set up to allow advertisements to be both physical and electronic (they can be seen in both live and replay shots).

In 2007, the first on-field advertising appeared since the park&#x27;s early days. Sporting goods firm Under Armour placed its logo on the double-doors between the ivy on the outfield wall in left-center and right-center fields. Advertisements were also placed in the dugouts, originally for Sears department stores, then Walter E. Smithe furniture and currently State Farm insurance.

For 2008 and 2009, the Cubs worked out an agreement with the Chicago Board Options Exchange to allow the CBOE to auction some 70 box seat season tickets and award naming rights to them.

For the 2009 season, the Cubs announced that the renovated restaurant space in the southeast corner of Wrigley Field, formerly known as the Friendly Confines Cafe, would be renamed the Captain Morgan Club.

On October 27, 2009, Thomas S. Ricketts officially took over 95% ownership of the Cubs and Wrigley Field, and 20% ownership of Comcast SportsNet Chicago. The Tribune retained 5% ownership. Ricketts, however, has expressed no interest in selling the naming rights to the park, preferring that it retain the name it has used since 1926.

====Outside venues====
Corporate sponsorship has not been limited to the park itself. Wrigley Field has a view of the neighborhood buildings across Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. In addition to spectators standing or sitting on the apartment roofs, corporate sponsors have frequently taken advantage of those locations as well. In the earliest days of Weeghman Park, one building across Sheffield Avenue advertised a local hangout known as Bismarck Gardens (later called the Marigold Gardens after World War I). That same building has since advertised for the Torco Oil Company, Southwest Airlines, the Miller Brewing Company, and Gilbert&#x27;s Craft Sausages.

A building across from deep right-center field was topped by a neon sign for Baby Ruth candy beginning in the mid-1930s and running for some 40 years. That placement by the Chicago-based Curtiss Candy Company (which is now under Nestlé), coincidentally positioned in the line of sight of &quot;Babe Ruth&#x27;s called shot&quot;, proved fortuitous when games began to be televised in the 1940s—the sign was also in the line of sight of the ground level camera behind and to the left of home plate. The aging sign was eventually removed in the early 1970s.

Another long-standing venue for a sign is the sloping roof of a building behind left-center field. Unsuitable for the bleachers that now decorate many of those buildings, that building&#x27;s angling roof has been painted in the form of a large billboard since at least the 1940s. In recent years, it has borne a bright-red Budweiser sign, and beginning in 2009, an advertisement for Horseshoe Casino. Other buildings have carried signs sponsoring beers, such as Old Style (when it was a Cubs broadcasting sponsor) and Miller, and also WGN-TV, which has telecast Cubs games since April 1948.

====Legacy partners====
In January 2013, the Ricketts family launched &quot;Legacy Partners&quot;, a marketing effort to sell new advertising in and around the renovated Wrigley Field. In conjunction with the new &quot;W Partners&quot;, the Cubs entered into 10-year agreements with its largest advertisers.

=== Win flag ===

Beginning in the days of P.K. Wrigley and the 1937 bleacher/scoreboard reconstruction, a flag with either a &quot;W&quot; or an &quot;L&quot; has flown from atop the scoreboard masthead, indicating the day&#x27;s result. In case of a doubleheader that is split, both flags are flown.

Past Cubs media guides show that the original flags were blue with a white &quot;W&quot; and white with a blue &quot;L&quot;, the latter coincidentally suggesting &quot;surrender&quot;. In 1978, blue and white lights were mounted atop the scoreboard, to further denote wins and losses.

The flags were replaced in the early 1980s, and the color schemes were reversed with the &quot;win flag&quot; being white with a blue W, and the &quot;loss flag&quot; the opposite. In 1982, the retired number of Ernie Banks was flying on a foul pole, as white with blue numbers, in 1987, the retired number of Billy Williams joined Banks, the two flags were positioned from the foul poles, Banks from left field, and Williams from right field. Later on, the team retired numbers for Ron Santo, Ryne Sandberg, Ferguson Jenkins and Greg Maddux, with Jenkins and Maddux both using the same number (31).

Keeping with tradition, fans are known to bring win flags to home and away games, displaying them after a Cubs win. Flags are also sold at the ballpark. On April 24, 2008, the Cubs flew an extra white flag displaying &quot;10,000&quot; in blue, along with the win flag, as the 10,000th win in team history was achieved on the road the previous night. Alongside the tradition of the &quot;W&quot; and &quot;L&quot; flags, the song &quot;Go, Cubs, Go&quot; is sung after each home win (it was also sung by visiting Cubs fans in game 7 of the 2016 World Series at Progressive Field in Cleveland, where the Cubs clinched their first championship since 1908). Also, following the 2015 addition of the park&#x27;s Daktronics video screens, the large &quot;W&quot; in the &quot;Wintrust&quot; logo on the left field video screen is kept on following Cubs&#x27; wins.

===&quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;===
The tradition of singing &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; at Cubs home games began when Hall of Fame announcer Harry Caray arrived in 1982 (he had sung it the preceding seven years as a broadcaster for the White Sox), and has remained a Wrigley Field staple. After Caray&#x27;s death, the tradition of a guest conductor began, with former baseball players, other sports stars, actors, and other celebrities invited to sing during the Seventh Inning Stretch. Among the best-known guests have been the actor Bill Murray, former Bears coach Mike Ditka, former Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg, former pitcher Mike Krukow, former longtime Cubs first baseman Mark Grace, former Houston Rockets star Tracy McGrady, Chicago Blackhawks forwards Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane, Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler, comedian Jay Leno, NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon, singers Ozzy Osbourne and Eddie Vedder, former Chicago lead singer Peter Cetera, boxer and actor Mr. T, actor and lifelong Cub fan Gary Sinise, actors Tom Arnold, James Belushi, WWE wrestler/Chicago native CM Punk, Vince Vaughn, actress Melissa McCarthy, and Illinois-native country music singer Brett Eldredge.

===Organ music===
Wrigley Field was the first Major League ballpark to introduce live organ music on April 26, 1941. The stadium&#x27;s first organist was Ray Nelson. As of July 2019, organist Gary Pressy, holds the record for 2,653 consecutive games played, never having missed a day&#x27;s work in 33 years. Today, most major league ballparks have replaced the traditional live organist with canned music programmed by a DJ. Pressy says: &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a dying art, especially at Wrigley Field ... The team respects tradition.&quot;

===Writing on the Wall===
During the 2016 postseason, someone wrote a message in chalk on the outer brick wall of the stadium along Waveland and Sheffield avenues. This started a chain reaction and more fans began to write their own messages on the wall. The messages were anything from words of support expressed towards the team or just a name. Chalk covered a majority of the wall, to point where fans had to bring step ladders in order to reach upper spaces for their message. The Cubs themselves encouraged the event by supplying chalk and adding extra security. The event gained both local and national attention, receiving coverage from Fox Sports and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Wrigley Field had a brief cameo in the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd as Jake and Elwood Blues. In the film, Elwood lists 1060 W. Addison as his fake home address on his Illinois driver&#x27;s license, tricking the police and later the Illinois Nazis listening on police radio into heading for Wrigley Field. The 1984 film &quot;The Natural&quot;, starring Robert Redford, had a scene set at Wrigley but was actually filmed at All-High Stadium in Buffalo, New York. All other baseball action scenes in that movie were shot in Buffalo, at the since-demolished War Memorial Stadium.

During Cubs games, fans will often stand outside the park on Waveland Avenue, waiting for home run balls hit over the wall and out of the park. However, as a tradition, Cubs fans inside and sometimes even outside the park will promptly throw any home run ball hit by an opposing player back onto the field of play, a ritual depicted in the 1977 stage play &quot;Bleacher Bums&quot; and in the 1993 film &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot;.

The ballpark was featured in a scene in the 1986 film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, where the outside marquee read &quot;Save Ferris&quot;. The director, John Hughes, originally wanted to film at Comiskey Park (he was a White Sox fan) but the team was out of town during filming. The 2006 film &quot;The Break-Up&quot; used Wrigley Field as the setting for its opening scene. An early 1990s film about Babe Ruth had the obligatory scene in Wrigley Field about the &quot;called shot&quot; (the ballpark also doubled as Yankee Stadium for the film). A scoreboard similar to the one existing in 1932 was used, atop an ivy wall (though that did not exist until later in the decade).

The ballpark was used for the establishing tryouts scene in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; (1992). This film was a Hollywood account of the 1940s women&#x27;s baseball league which Cubs owner P.K. Wrigley championed during World War II. Garry Marshall (older brother of the film&#x27;s director Penny Marshall) has a cameo as &quot;Walter Harvey&quot;, Wrigley&#x27;s fictional alter ego. The sign behind the scoreboard was temporarily redone to read &quot;Harvey Field&quot;, and filming was split between Wrigley and Cantigny Park near Wheaton, Illinois.

Many television series have made featured scenes set in Wrigley Field, including &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Crime Story&quot;, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, &quot;Prison Break&quot;, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, &quot;My Boys&quot;, &quot;Chicago Fire&quot; and &quot;Mike &amp; Molly&quot;. Also, the animated comedy &quot;Family Guy&quot; featured a scene at Wrigley Field that parodied the Steve Bartman incident. In an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;He Loves to Fly and He D&#x27;ohs&quot;, upon arriving in Chicago, Homer walks past a number of Chicago landmarks, including Wrigley Field, followed by a generic-looking stadium bearing the name &quot;Wherever the White Sox play&quot;. In 2007, the band Nine Inch Nails created a promotional audio skit, which involved Wrigley Field being the target of disgruntled war veteran&#x27;s terrorist attack.

The late-1970s comedy stage play &quot;Bleacher Bums&quot; was set in the right field bleachers at Wrigley. The video of the play was also set on a stage, with bleachers suggesting Wrigley&#x27;s layout, rather than in the actual ballpark&#x27;s bleachers. The tradition of throwing opposition home run balls back was explained by Dennis Franz&#x27;s character: &quot;If someone hands you some garbage, you have to throw it back at them!&quot;

In the cartoon series &quot;Biker Mice from Mars&quot;, the eponymous main characters hide out in the scoreboard of the stadium, which is named Quigley Field.

A dog park in the Wrightwood Neighbors section of Lincoln Park is named Wiggly Field (1997).

The stadium was also featured on the popular Travel Channel television show &quot;Great Hotels&quot;, starring Samantha Brown. She attended a game during a visit to Chicago.

Chicago folk singer Steve Goodman featured Wrigley Field as the setting for his popular Cubs lament &quot;A Dying Cub Fan&#x27;s Last Request&quot;, extolling both the trials of the Cubs and the place Wrigley Field holds in Cub fans&#x27; hearts. After his death from leukemia, Goodman&#x27;s ashes were scattered at Wrigley Field as described in the lyrics.

The Statler Brothers&#x27; 1981 song &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait On Me&quot; referred to a then-implausible situation: &quot;When the lights go on at Wrigley Field&quot;. However, after lights were installed, the line was changed to &quot;When they put a dome on Wrigley Field&quot; for their 1989 &quot;Live-Sold Out&quot; album.

A few brief shots of Wrigley Field appear in the 1949 movie &quot;It Happens Every Spring&quot;. It is also seen on the History Channel&#x27;s show &quot;Life After People.&quot;

The stadium made a brief appearance in the open for the first episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, with Conan rushing through the turnstiles while running from New York (where his previous show, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, was taped) to Los Angeles (where his new show was taped, until his role as host ended on January 22, 2010) and then running onto the field while being chased by Cubs security. The route O&#x27;Brien takes is somewhat misleading, as he is shown running south on Michigan Avenue past the Tribune Tower&quot;, a terrorist turns off all the electricity at the stadium for a few minutes to demonstrate how hackers could penetrate city electrical systems.

An overgrown Wrigley Field is shown in the new television series &quot;Revolution&quot; (2012).

In episode 9 of season 3 of &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; (2015), Wrigley Field makes a short appearance as the home of a fictional soccer team called the &quot;Chicago Norsemen&quot; who, according to a banner, were &quot;1963 Annual Soccer Champions&quot;.

Wrigley Field was the site of the final task of &quot;The Amazing Race 29&quot; finale. One team member was guided by their partner in the press box via one way radio. They were told to place numbers on the hand-turned scoreboard corresponding to their team&#x27;s final placement at the end of each of the previous eleven episodes, before searching the stadium&#x27;s seats for their final clue.

On the Sonic Youth live album &quot;Smart Bar Chicago 85&quot; the band introduces the final song, &#x27;Making The Nature Scene&#x27;, as being about &#x27;Tripping on Acid at Wrigley Field&#x27;.

In the 2020 film, &quot;Greenland&quot;, Wrigley Field is shown still standing despite being severely damaged amidst the ruins of Chicago after the collision of an interstellar comet that collided with Earth.

Wesley Willis, an outsider musician and Chicago folk artist, had a track titled &quot;Wrigley Field&quot; on his album &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 3&quot;, which he played with his band &#x27;The Dragnews&#x27;.

==Accessibility and transportation==

The Chicago &quot;L&quot; Red Line stop at is less than one block east of Wrigley Field; the stadium was originally built for proximity to the &quot;L&quot; tracks. As Addison is frequently crowded after games, many fans use , the next station to the north, still less than a mile from the stadium.

Additionally, Purple Line Express trains stop at Sheridan before weekday night games in order to provide an additional connection for passengers traveling from Evanston, Skokie, and northern Chicago. After weekday night games, northbound Purple Line passengers are told to board at Sheridan, while southbound passengers are told to board at Addison.

At the conclusion of games, the scoreboard operator raises to the top of the center field scoreboard either a white flag with a blue &quot;W&quot; to signify a Cubs victory or a blue flag with a white &quot;L&quot; for a loss. This is done to show the outcome of the game to passengers on passing &quot;L&quot; trains, and also to anyone passing by the park. The basic flag color was once the exact opposite of the colors used today (the rationale being that white is the traditional color for surrender). In addition to rail service, the CTA provides two bus routes that serve Wrigley Field. CTA bus routes, 22 Clark and 152, Addison provide access to the ballpark. Biking to the field is also a popular alternative. As Halsted, Addison, and Clark streets all have designated biking lanes, getting to the field via bicycle is a widely used way to avoid hectic pre- and postgame traffic. Wrigley Field offers a complimentary bike check program to accommodate them; cyclists may check their bikes as much as 2 hours before games and 1 hour after games at racks off of Waveland Ave.

Parking in the area remains scarce, but that does not seem to bother fans who want to come to this baseball mecca, which drew over three million fans from 2004 until 2011, averaging a near-sellout every day of the season, even with many weekday afternoon games. The little parking that is available can go for as much as $100 per space. To partially alleviate this problem, the Cubs sponsor a parking shuttle service from the nearby DeVry University campus at Belmont and Western as part of their agreement with local neighborhood groups. This was not available during the World Series against the Detroit Tigers in 1945; cars parked as much as a mile away on residential streets and fans walked to Wrigley Field.

==Commemorative stamps==
In 2001, a series of commemorative postage stamps on the subject of baseball parks was issued by the U.S. Postal Service. Most of them were engravings taken from old colorized postcards, including the illustration of Wrigley Field. In the case of Wrigley, the scoreboard was cut off to hide the original postcard&#x27;s banner containing the park&#x27;s name. The stamp and its sources also show the center field bleachers filled with spectators, a practice that was later discontinued due to the risk to batters, who might lose the flight of a pitch amidst the white shirts. This led to the development of darker backgrounds to the pitcher&#x27;s mounds.

<doc id="40225" wikidata="Q130586" url="?curid=40225" title="George IV">
<text>George IV (George Augustus Frederick; 12 August 1762 – 26 June 1830) was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and King of Hanover from 29 January 1820 until his death in 1830. At the time of his accession to the throne, he was acting as prince regent for his father, King George III, having done so since 5 February 1811 during his father&#x27;s final mental illness.

George IV was the eldest child of King George III and Queen Charlotte. He led an extravagant lifestyle that contributed to the fashions of the Regency era. He was a patron of new forms of leisure, style and taste. He commissioned John Nash to build the Royal Pavilion in Brighton and remodel Buckingham Palace, and commissioned Jeffry Wyatville to rebuild Windsor Castle. George&#x27;s charm and culture earned him the title &quot;the first gentleman of England&quot;, but his dissolute way of life and poor relationships with his parents and his wife, Caroline of Brunswick, earned him the contempt of the people and dimmed the prestige of the monarchy. He excluded Caroline from his coronation and asked the government to introduce the unpopular Pains and Penalties Bill in an unsuccessful attempt to divorce her.

George&#x27;s rule was tarnished by scandal and financial extravagance. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible and he was strongly influenced by favourites. During most of George&#x27;s regency and reign, Lord Liverpool controlled the government as prime minister of the United Kingdom. Liverpool&#x27;s government presided over Britain&#x27;s ultimate victory over Napoleon and negotiated a peace settlement with the French. After Liverpool&#x27;s retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, Princess Charlotte, predeceased him in 1817, as did his childless younger brother Prince Frederick in 1827, so he was succeeded by another younger brother, William IV.

==Early life==
George was born at St James&#x27;s Palace, London, on 12 August 1762, the first child of King George III and Queen Charlotte. As the eldest son of a British sovereign, he automatically became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay at birth; he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester a few days later. On 18 September of the same year, he was baptised by Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury. His godparents were his maternal uncle Adolphus Frederick IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (for whom the Lord Chamberlain, William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, stood proxy); his paternal grand-uncle Prince William, Duke of Cumberland; and his grandmother Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales. George was a talented student, and quickly learned to speak French, German and Italian, in addition to his native English.

At the age of 18, Prince George was given a separate establishment, and in dramatic contrast to his prosaic, scandal-free father, threw himself with zest into a life of dissipation and wild extravagance involving heavy drinking and numerous mistresses and escapades. He was a witty conversationalist, drunk or sober, and showed good, but grossly expensive, taste in decorating his palace. George turned 21 in 1783, and obtained a grant of £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) from Parliament and an annual income of £50,000 (equivalent to £ today) from his father. It was far too little for his wants—his stables alone cost £31,000 a year. He then established his residence in Carlton House, where he lived a profligate life. Animosity developed between the prince and his father, who desired more frugal behaviour on the part of the heir apparent. The King, a political conservative, was also alienated by the prince&#x27;s adherence to Charles James Fox and other radically inclined politicians.

Soon after he reached the age of 21, the prince became infatuated with Maria Fitzherbert. She was a commoner (though granddaughter of a baronet), six years his elder, twice widowed, and a Roman Catholic. Nevertheless, the prince was determined to marry her. This was in spite of the Act of Settlement 1701, which barred the spouse of a Catholic from succeeding to the throne, and the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which prohibited his marriage without the King&#x27;s consent.

The couple went through a marriage ceremony on 15 December 1785 at Fitzherbert&#x27;s house in Park Street, Mayfair. Legally the union was void, as the King&#x27;s consent was not granted (and never even requested). However, Fitzherbert believed that she was the prince&#x27;s canonical and true wife, holding the law of the Church to be superior to the law of the State. For political reasons, the union was to remain secret and Fitzherbert promised not to reveal it. But, in spring 1786, covert allusions to the marriage appeared in the press, and several satirical prints depicted the clandestine marriage. 

Prince George was plunged into debt by his exorbitant lifestyle. His father refused to assist him, forcing him to quit Carlton House and live at Fitzherbert&#x27;s residence. In 1787, the prince&#x27;s political allies proposed to relieve his debts with a parliamentary grant. George&#x27;s relationship with Fitzherbert was suspected, and revelation of the illegal marriage would have scandalised the nation and doomed any parliamentary proposal to aid him. Acting on Prince George&#x27;s authority, the Whig leader Charles James Fox declared that the story was a calumny. Fitzherbert was not pleased with the public denial of the marriage in such vehement terms and contemplated severing her ties to George. He appeased her by asking another Whig, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, to restate Fox&#x27;s forceful declaration in more careful words. Parliament, meanwhile, granted the prince £161,000 (equivalent to £ today) to pay his debts and £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) for improvements to Carlton House.

==Regency crisis of 1788==
In the summer of 1788, the King&#x27;s mental health deteriorated, possibly as the result of the hereditary disease porphyria. He nonetheless discharged some of his duties and declared Parliament from 25 September to 20 November. During the prorogation, he became deranged, posing a threat to his own life, and when Parliament reconvened in November, the King could not deliver the customary speech from the throne during the State Opening of Parliament. Parliament found itself in an untenable position: according to long-established law it could not proceed to any business until the delivery of the King&#x27;s Speech at a State Opening.

Although arguably barred from doing so, Parliament began debating a regency. In the House of Commons, Charles James Fox declared his opinion that Prince George was automatically entitled to exercise sovereignty during the King&#x27;s incapacity. A contrasting opinion was held by the prime minister, William Pitt the Younger, who argued that, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, the right to choose a regent belonged to Parliament alone. He even stated that, without parliamentary authority &quot;the Prince of Wales had no more right ... to assume the government, than any other individual subject of the country&quot;. Though disagreeing on the principle underlying a regency, Pitt agreed with Fox that the Prince of Wales would be the most convenient choice for a regent.

The Prince of Wales, though offended by Pitt&#x27;s boldness, did not lend his full support to Fox&#x27;s approach. Prince George&#x27;s brother Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, declared that George would not attempt to exercise any power without previously obtaining the consent of Parliament. Following the passage of preliminary resolutions Pitt outlined a formal plan for the regency, suggesting that Prince George&#x27;s powers be greatly limited. Among other things, George would not be able either to sell the King&#x27;s property or to grant a peerage to anyone other than a child of the King. Prince George denounced Pitt&#x27;s scheme by declaring it a &quot;project for producing weakness, disorder, and insecurity in every branch of the administration of affairs&quot;. In the interests of the nation, both factions agreed to compromise.

A significant technical impediment to any Regency Bill involved the lack of a speech from the throne, which was necessary before Parliament could proceed to any debates or votes. The speech was normally delivered by the King but could also be delivered by royal representatives known as Lords Commissioners. However, no document could empower the Lords Commissioners to act unless the Great Seal of the Realm was affixed to it. The seal could not be legally affixed without the prior authorisation of the sovereign. Pitt and his fellow ministers ignored the last requirement and instructed the Lord Chancellor to affix the Great Seal without the King&#x27;s consent, as the act of affixing the Great Seal in itself gave legal force to the bill. The legal fiction was denounced by Edmund Burke as &quot;forgery, fraud&quot;; a &quot;glaring falsehood&quot; and a &quot;palpable absurdity&quot;. Prince Frederick described the plan as &quot;unconstitutional and illegal&quot;. Nevertheless, others in Parliament felt that such a scheme was necessary to preserve an effective government. Consequently, on 3 February 1789, more than two months after it had convened, Parliament was formally opened by an &quot;illegal&quot; group of Lords Commissioners. The Regency Bill was introduced, but before it could be passed the King recovered. The King declared retroactively that the instrument authorising the Lords Commissioners to act was valid.

==Marriage and mistresses==
Prince George&#x27;s debts continued to climb, and his father refused to aid him unless he married his cousin Princess Caroline of Brunswick. In 1795, the prince acquiesced, and they were married on 8 April 1795 at the Chapel Royal, St James&#x27;s Palace. The marriage, however, was disastrous; each party was unsuited to the other. The two were formally separated after the birth of their only child, Princess Charlotte, in 1796, and remained separated thereafter. George remained attached to Maria Fitzherbert for the rest of his life, despite several periods of estrangement.

George&#x27;s mistresses included Mary Robinson, an actress whom he paid to leave the stage; Grace Elliott, the divorced wife of a physician; and Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey, who dominated his life for some years. In later life, his mistresses were the Marchioness of Hertford and the Marchioness Conyngham.

George was rumoured to have fathered several illegitimate children. James Ord (born 1786)—who moved to the United States and became a Jesuit priest—was reportedly his son by Fitzherbert. Late in life, George told a friend that he had a son who was a naval officer in the West Indies, whose identity has been tentatively established as Captain Henry A. F. Hervey (1786–1824), reportedly George&#x27;s child by the songwriter Lady Anne Lindsay (later Barnard), a daughter of James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres. Other reported children include Major George Seymour Crole, the son of theatre manager&#x27;s daughter Eliza Crole; William Hampshire, the son of publican&#x27;s daughter Sarah Brown; and Charles &quot;Beau&quot; Candy, the son of a Frenchwoman with that surname. Anthony Camp, Director of Research at the Society of Genealogists, has dismissed the claims that George IV was the father of Ord, Hervey, Hampshire and Candy as fictitious.

The problem of George&#x27;s debts, which amounted to the extraordinary sum of £630,000 in 1795 (equivalent to £ today), was solved (at least temporarily) by Parliament. Being unwilling to make an outright grant to relieve these debts, it provided him an additional sum of £65,000 (equivalent to £ today) per annum. In 1803, a further £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) was added, and George&#x27;s debts as at 1795 were finally cleared in 1806, although the debts he had incurred since 1795 remained.

In 1804, a dispute arose over the custody of Princess Charlotte, which led to her being placed in the care of the King. It also led to a Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry into Princess Caroline&#x27;s conduct after her husband accused her of having an illegitimate son. The investigation cleared Caroline of the charge but still revealed her behaviour to have been extraordinarily indiscreet.

==Regency==


In late 1810, the King&#x27;s mental health once again broke down, following the death of his youngest daughter, Princess Amelia. Parliament agreed to follow the precedent of 1788; without the King&#x27;s consent, the Lord Chancellor affixed the Great Seal of the Realm to letters patent naming Lords Commissioners. The letters patent lacked the Royal Sign Manual, but were sealed by request of resolutions passed by both Houses of Parliament. The Lords Commissioners appointed by the letters patent, in the name of the King, then signified the granting of Royal Assent to a bill that became the Regency Act 1811. Parliament restricted some of the powers of the Prince Regent (as the Prince of Wales became known). The constraints expired one year after the passage of the Act. The Prince of Wales became Prince Regent on 5 February 1811.

The Regent let his ministers take full charge of government affairs, playing a far smaller role than his father. The principle that the prime minister was the person supported by a majority in the House of Commons, whether the King personally favoured him or not, became established. His governments, with little help from the Regent, presided over British policy. One of the most important political conflicts facing the country concerned Catholic emancipation, the movement to relieve Roman Catholics of various political disabilities. The Tories, led by Prime Minister Spencer Perceval, were opposed to Catholic emancipation, while the Whigs supported it. At the beginning of the Regency, Prince George was expected to support the Whig leader, Lord Grenville. He did not, however, immediately put Grenville and the Whigs into office. Influenced by his mother, he claimed that a sudden dismissal of the Tory government would exact too great a toll on the health of the King (a steadfast supporter of the Tories), thereby eliminating any chance of a recovery.

In 1812, when it appeared highly unlikely that the King would recover, the Prince Regent again failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of disagreements over Catholic emancipation. Grudgingly, Prince George allowed Perceval to continue as prime minister.

On 11 May 1812, Perceval was assassinated by John Bellingham. The Prince Regent was prepared to reappoint all the members of the Perceval ministry under a new leader. The House of Commons formally declared its desire for a &quot;strong and efficient administration&quot;, so George then offered leadership of the government to Lord Wellesley and afterwards to Lord Moira. He doomed the attempts of both to failure, however, by forcing each to construct an all-party ministry at a time when neither party wished to share power with the other. Possibly using the failure of the two peers as a pretext, George immediately reappointed the Perceval administration, with Lord Liverpool as prime minister.

The Tories, unlike Whigs such as Lord Grey, sought to continue the vigorous prosecution of the war in Continental Europe against the powerful and aggressive Emperor of the French, Napoleon I. An anti-French alliance, which included Russia, Prussia, Austria, Britain and several smaller countries, defeated Napoleon in 1814. In the subsequent Congress of Vienna, it was decided that the Electorate of Hanover, a state that had shared a monarch with Britain since 1714, would be raised to the Kingdom of Hanover. Napoleon returned from exile in 1815, but was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo by the Duke of Wellington, brother of Lord Wellesley.

During this period George took an active interest in matters of style and taste, and his associates such as the dandy Beau Brummell and the architect John Nash created the Regency style, exemplified by the Regency terraces of Regent&#x27;s Park and Regent Street. George took up the new idea of the seaside spa and had the Brighton Pavilion developed as a fantastical seaside palace, adapted by Nash in the &quot;Indian Gothic&quot; style inspired loosely by the Taj Mahal, with extravagant &quot;Indian&quot; and &quot;Chinese&quot; interiors.

==Reign==

When George III died in 1820, the Prince Regent, then aged 57, ascended the throne as George IV, with no real change in his powers. By the time of his accession, he was obese and possibly addicted to laudanum.

George IV&#x27;s relationship with his wife Caroline had deteriorated by the time of his accession. They had lived separately since 1796, and both were having affairs. In 1814, Caroline left the United Kingdom for continental Europe, but she chose to return for her husband&#x27;s coronation and to publicly assert her rights as queen consort. However, he refused to recognise Caroline as queen, and commanded British ambassadors to ensure that monarchs in foreign courts did the same. By royal command, Caroline&#x27;s name was omitted from the Book of Common Prayer, the liturgy of the Church of England.

The King sought a divorce, but his advisors suggested that any divorce proceedings might involve the publication of details relating to George&#x27;s own adulterous relationships. Therefore, he requested and ensured the introduction of the Pains and Penalties Bill, under which Parliament could have imposed legal penalties without a trial in a court of law. The bill would have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at Westminster Abbey, on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that she thought she had been poisoned.


George&#x27;s coronation was a magnificent and expensive affair, costing about £243,000 (approximately £ in 2025; for comparison, his father&#x27;s coronation had only cost about £10,000). Despite the enormous cost, it was a popular event. In 1821, George became the first monarch to pay a state visit to Ireland since Richard II of England. The following year he visited Edinburgh for &quot;one and twenty daft days&quot;. His visit to Scotland, organised by Sir Walter Scott, was the first by a reigning monarch since the mid-17th century.

George spent most of his later reign in seclusion at Windsor Castle, but he continued to intervene in politics. At first it was believed that he would support Catholic emancipation, as he had proposed a Catholic Emancipation Bill for Ireland in 1797, but his anti-Catholic views became clear in 1813 when he privately canvassed against the ultimately defeated Catholic Relief Bill of 1813. By 1824 he was denouncing Catholic emancipation in public. Having taken the coronation oath on his accession, George now argued that he had sworn to uphold the Protestant faith, and could not support any pro-Catholic measures. The influence of the Crown was so great, and the will of the Tories under Prime Minister Liverpool so strong, that Catholic emancipation seemed hopeless. In 1827, however, Liverpool retired, to be replaced by the pro-emancipation Tory George Canning. When Canning entered office, the King, hitherto content with privately instructing his ministers on the Catholic Question, thought it fit to make a public declaration to the effect that his sentiments on the question were those of his revered father, George III.

Canning&#x27;s views on the Catholic Question were not well received by the most conservative Tories, including the Duke of Wellington. As a result, the ministry was forced to include Whigs. Canning died later in that year, leaving Lord Goderich to lead the tenuous Tory–Whig coalition. Goderich left office in 1828, to be succeeded by Wellington, who had by that time accepted that the denial of some measure of relief to Roman Catholics was politically untenable. George was never as friendly with Wellington as he had been with Canning and chose to annoy the Duke by pretending to have fought at Waterloo disguised as a German general. With great difficulty Wellington obtained the King&#x27;s consent to the introduction of a Catholic Relief Bill on 29 January 1829. Under pressure from his fanatically anti-Catholic brother Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, the King withdrew his approval and in protest the Cabinet resigned &quot;en masse&quot; on 4 March. The next day the King, now under intense political pressure, reluctantly agreed to the Bill and the ministry remained in power. Royal assent was finally granted to the Catholic Relief Act on 13 April.

== Declining health and death ==

George&#x27;s heavy drinking and indulgent lifestyle had taken their toll on his health by the late 1820s. While still Prince of Wales, he had become obese through his huge banquets and copious consumption of alcohol, making him the target of ridicule on the rare occasions that he appeared in public; by 1797, his weight had reached . By 1824, his corset was made for a waist of . He had gout, arteriosclerosis, peripheral edema (&quot;dropsy&quot;), and possibly porphyria. In his last years, he spent whole days in bed and had acute and serious spasms of breathlessness.

George&#x27;s last years were marked by increasing physical and mental decay and withdrawal from public affairs. Privately, a senior aide to the King confided to his diary: &quot;A more contemptible, cowardly, selfish, unfeeling dog does not exist ... There have been good and wise kings but not many of them ... and this I believe to be one of the worst.&quot; By December 1828, like his father, George was almost completely blind from cataracts, and had such severe gout in his right hand and arm that he could no longer sign documents. In mid-1829, David Wilkie reported the King &quot;was wasting away frightfully day after day&quot;, and had become so obese that he looked &quot;like a great sausage stuffed into the covering&quot;. George took laudanum to counteract severe bladder pains, which left him in a drugged and mentally impaired state for days on end. He underwent surgery to remove a cataract in September 1829, by which time he was regularly taking over 100 drops of laudanum before state occasions.

By the spring of 1830, George&#x27;s imminent end was apparent. Now largely confined to his bedchambers, having completely lost sight in one eye and describing himself &quot;as blind as a beetle&quot;, he was forced to approve legislation with a stamp of his signature in the presence of witnesses. His weight was recorded to be . Attacks of breathlessness due to dropsy forced him to sleep upright in a chair, and doctors frequently tapped his abdomen in order to drain excess fluid. Despite his obvious decline, George was admired for clinging doggedly to life. His will to live and still-prodigious appetite astonished observers; in April 1830, the Duke of Wellington wrote that the King had consumed for breakfast &quot;a Pidgeon and Beef Steak Pye ... Three parts of a bottle of Mozelle, a Glass of Dry Champagne, two Glasses of Port [and] a Glass of Brandy&quot;, followed by a large dose of laudanum. Writing to Maria Fitzherbert in June, the King&#x27;s doctor, Sir Henry Halford, noted &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s constitution is a gigantic one, and his elasticity under the most severe pressure exceeds what I have ever witnessed in thirty-eight years&#x27; experience.&quot; Though George had been under Halford&#x27;s care since the time of the Regency, the doctor&#x27;s social ambitions and perceived lack of competence were strongly criticised, with &quot;The Lancet&quot; labelling Halford&#x27;s bulletins on the King&#x27;s health as &quot;utterly and entirely destitute of information&quot;, subsequently characterising Halford&#x27;s treatment of George, which involved administering both opium and laudanum as sedatives, as appearing to lack sense or direction.

George dictated his will in May and became very devout in his final months, confessing to an archdeacon that he repented of his dissolute life, but hoped mercy would be shown to him as he had always tried to do the best for his subjects. By June, he was unable to lie down, and received the Sacrament on 14 June in the presence of Lady Conyngham, Halford, and a clergyman. While Halford only informed the Cabinet on 24 June that &quot;the King&#x27;s cough continues with considerable expectoration&quot;, he privately told his wife that &quot;things are coming to a conclusion ... I shall be released about Monday.&quot;

At about three in the morning of 26 June 1830 at Windsor Castle, George awoke and passed a bowel movement—&quot;a large evacuation mix&#x27;d with blood&quot;. He then sent for Halford, allegedly calling to his servants &quot;Sir Henry! Sir Henry! Fetch him; this is death!&quot; Accounts of George&#x27;s final moments and last words vary. According to Halford, following his arrival and that of Sir William Knighton, the King&#x27;s &quot;lips grew livid, and he dropped his head on the page&#x27;s shoulder ... I was up the stairs in five minutes, and he died but eight minutes afterwards.&quot; Other accounts state the King placed his hands on his stomach and said &quot;Surely, this must be death&quot;, or that he called out &quot;Good God, what is this?&quot;, clasped his page&#x27;s hand, and said &quot;my boy, this is death&quot;. George died at 3:15 a.m. An autopsy conducted by his physicians revealed George had died from upper gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from the rupture of a blood vessel in his stomach. A large tumour &quot;the size of an orange&quot; was found attached to his bladder; his heart was enlarged, had heavily calcified valves and was surrounded by a large fat deposit. The King was buried in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 15 July.

==Legacy==

George&#x27;s only legitimate child, Charlotte, had died from post-partum complications in 1817, after delivering a stillborn son. George III&#x27;s second son, Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, had died childless in 1827, so the throne passed to the third son of George III, William, Duke of Clarence, who reigned as William IV.

George was described as the &quot;First Gentleman of England&quot; on account of his style and manners. He was bright, clever, and knowledgeable, but his laziness and gluttony led him to squander much of his talent. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that he would always prefer &quot;a girl and a bottle to politics and a sermon&quot;.

The Regency period saw a shift in fashion that was largely determined by George. After political opponents put a tax on wig powder, he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair. He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin. His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish tartan dress as it is known today.

During the political crisis caused by Catholic emancipation, the Duke of Wellington said that George was &quot;the worst man he ever fell in with his whole life, the most selfish, the most false, the most ill-natured, the most entirely without one redeeming quality&quot;. However, his eulogy delivered in the House of Lords called George &quot;the most accomplished man of his age&quot; and praised his knowledge and talent. Wellington&#x27;s true feelings were probably somewhere between these two extremes; as he said later, George was &quot;a magnificent patron of the arts ... the most extraordinary compound of talent, wit, buffoonery, obstinacy, and good feeling—in short a medley of the most opposite qualities, with a great preponderance of good—that I ever saw in any character in my life.&quot;

Upon George&#x27;s death, &quot;The Times&quot; captured elite opinion succinctly: &quot;There never was an individual less regretted by his fellow-creatures than this deceased king. What eye has wept for him? What heart has heaved one throb of unmercenary sorrow? ... If he ever had a friend—a devoted friend in any rank of life—we protest that the name of him or her never reached us&quot;.

There are many statues of George IV, a large number of which were erected during his reign. In the United Kingdom, they include a bronze statue of him on horseback by Sir Francis Chantrey in Trafalgar Square.

In Edinburgh, &quot;George IV Bridge&quot; is a main street linking the Old Town High Street to the north over the ravine of the Cowgate, designed by the architect Thomas Hamilton in 1829 and completed in 1835. King&#x27;s Cross, now a major transport hub sitting on the border of Camden and Islington in north London, takes its name from a short-lived monument erected to George IV in the early 1830s. A square and a neighbouring park in St Luke&#x27;s, Islington, are also named after George IV.

===Arms===
George&#x27;s coat of arms as the Prince of Wales was the royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a label of three points Argent. The arms included the royal crest and supporters but with the single arched coronet of his rank, all charged on the shoulder with a similar label. His arms followed the change in the royal arms in 1801, when the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon and the French quarter was dropped altogether. The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to the arms of the King.

As king, George&#x27;s arms were those of his two kingdoms, the United Kingdom and Hanover, superimposed: Quarterly, I and IV Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland); overall an escutcheon tierced in pall reversed (for Hanover), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for Lüneburg), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for Westphalia), overall an inescutcheon Gules charged with the crown of Charlemagne Or, the whole escutcheon surmounted by a crown.

<text>A rocket sled is a test platform that slides along a track (e.g. set of rails), propelled by rockets. 

A rocket sled differs from a rocket car in not using wheels; at high speeds wheels would spin to pieces due to the extreme centrifugal forces. Apart from rare examples running on snow or ice (such as Max Valier&#x27;s RAK BOBs of the late 1920s and Harry Bull&#x27;s BR-1 in 1931), most rocket sleds run on a track. Although some rocket sleds ride on single beams or rails, most use a pair of rails. Standard gauge (1.435 m / 56.5 in) is common but sled tracks of narrower or wider gauge also exist. The rail cross-section profile is usually that of a Vignoles rail, commonly used for railroads. Sliding pads, called &quot;slippers&quot;, are curved around the head of the rails to prevent the sled from flying off the track. Air cushions and magnetic levitation have also been used as alternatives, with potential benefits including reduced sled vibration.

A rocket sled holds the land-based speed record for a vehicle, at Mach 8.5.

==Usage==
Rocket sleds were used extensively early in the Cold War to accelerate equipment considered too experimental (hazardous) for testing directly in piloted aircraft. The equipment to be tested under high acceleration or high airspeed conditions was installed along with appropriate instrumentation, data recording and telemetry equipment on the sled. The sled was then accelerated according to the experiment&#x27;s design requirements for data collection along a length of isolated, precisely level and straight test track.
Testing ejection seat systems and technology prior to their use in experimental or operational aircraft was a common application of the rocket sled at Holloman Air Force Base. Perhaps the most famous, the tracks at Edwards Air Force Base were used to test missiles, supersonic ejection seats, aircraft shapes and the effects of acceleration and deceleration on humans. The rocket sled track at Edwards Air Force Base was dismantled and used to extend the track at Holloman Air Force Base, taking it to almost 10 miles (16 km) in length.

Unmanned rocket sleds continue to be used to test missile components without requiring costly live missile launches. A world speed record of Mach 8.5 (6,416 mph / 10,325 km/h) was achieved by a four-stage rocket sled at Holloman Air Force Base on April 30, 2003, the highest speed ever attained by a land vehicle.

Murphy&#x27;s law first received public attention during a press conference about rocket sled testing.

==Rocket Sled Tracks==

Other former rocket sled tracks include those at the following locations:
* Peenemünde, Germany (V-1 launch ramp)
* Base B1, Colomb-Béchar, Algeria (HB3 track (330 m) of CIEES, built by Hotchkiss-Brandt)
* PISQ, Salto di Quirra, Sardinia, Italy (660-ft supersonic sled track with 8° inclination)

<doc id="40228" wikidata="Q4785914" url="?curid=40228" title="Archaeology of Algeria">
<text>The archeology in [[Algeria]] is rich in prehistoric memorials of human occupation. Algeria contains many Roman remains and is rich in monuments of Saracenic art.

==Megalithic remains==
Algeria has many megalithic remains, of which nearly every known kind has been found in the country. Numerous flints of palaeolithic type have been discovered, notably at Tlemcen and Kolea. Near Djelfa, in the Great Atlas, and at Mechra-Sfa (&quot;ford of the flat stones&quot;), a peninsula in the valley of the river Mina not far from Tiaret, are vast numbers of megalithic monuments.

Notable among the prehistoric cultures of the area is the Capsian culture, whose shell-mounds are found throughout the north.

==Famous sites==
===Madghacen===
Madghacen is a monument similar to the Qabr-er-Rumia, but older. It was built around 150 B.C. as the burial place of the Numidian kings, and is situated southwest of Constantine. The form is that of a truncated cone, placed on a cylindrical base, in diameter. It is high. The columns encircling the cylindrical portion are stunted and much broader at the base than the top; the capitals are Doric. Many of the columns, 60 in number, have been much damaged. When the sepulchral chamber was opened in 1873 by Bauchetet, a French engineer officer, clear evidence was found that at some remote period the tomb had been rifled and an attempt made to destroy it by fire.

===Qabr-er-Rumia===

The Qabr-er-Rumia-- best known by its French name, &quot;Tombeau de la Chrétienne&quot; (&quot;grave of the Christian lady&quot;), tradition making it the burial-place of Florinda, &quot;la Cava Rumía&quot;, the beautiful and unfortunate daughter of Count Julian—is near Kolea, and is known to be the tomb of the Mauretanian king Juba II and of his wife Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, queen of Egypt. It is built on a hill above the sea. A circular stone building surmounted by a pyramid rests on a lower platform, square.

Originally the monument was about in height, but it has been wantonly damaged. Its height is now : the cylindrical portion , the pyramid The base, in diameter, is ornamented with 60 engaged Ionic columns. The capitals of the columns have disappeared, but their design is preserved among the drawings of James Bruce, the African traveller.

In the centre of the tomb are two vaulted chambers, reached by a spiral passage or gallery , about the same height, and . The sepulchral chambers are separated by a short passage, and are cut off from the gallery by stone doors made of a single slab which can be moved up and down by levers, like a portcullis. The larger of the two chambers is long by broad and high. The other chamber is somewhat smaller.

The tomb was previously looted, probably in search of treasure. In 1555, Salah Rais, pasha of Algiers, set men to work to pull it down, but the records say that the attempt was given up because big black wasps came from under the stones and stung them to death. At the end of the 18th century, Baba Mahommed tried in vain to batter down the tomb with artillery. In 1866 it was explored by order of the emperor Napoleon III, the work being carried out by Adrien Berbrugger and Oscar Maccarthy.

===The Jedars===
The Jedars (Arabic &quot;walls&quot; or &quot;buildings&quot;) is the name given to a number of sepulchral monuments placed on hill-tops. A rectangular or square podium is in each case surmounted by a pyramid. The tombs date from the 5th to the 7th century of the Christian era, and lie in two distinct groups between Tiaret and Frenda. Frenda, which has largely preserved its old Berber character, has numerous dolmens and prehistoric rock sculptures close by.

===Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer===
Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer is a national park in the Sahara desert, located on a vast plateau in south-east Algeria, covering an area of over . It has one of the most important groupings of prehistoric cave art in the world, and was inducted into UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Site list in 1982.

Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer is known in the New Age culture for its Fungoid rock art, the primitive yet elaborate drawings of psychedelic mushrooms that hints on a shamanic consumption of those plants by the native people of this land.

==Recent discoveries==
In 2009, when the Place des Martyrs in Algiers was closed to build the subway station, Algerian and French archeologists found a 5th-century (Christian) basilica below layers of concrete.

In November 2018, archeologists in Algeria announced the discovery, on the site of Ain Boucherit near Sétif, of what seems to be stone tools (similar to Oldowans) and cut animal bones dated back to 2.4 million years old. This discovery turned Ain Boucherit into the oldest human site known today, and shook the theory of East Africa being the cradle of humanity.

<text>Algeria comprises of land, more than 80% of which is desert, in North Africa, between Morocco and Tunisia. It is the largest country in Africa. Its Arabic name, Al Jazair (the islands), is believed to derive from the rocky islands along the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea. The northern portion, an area of mountains, valleys, and plateaus between the Mediterranean and the Sahara Desert, forms an integral part of the section of North Africa known as the Maghreb. This area includes Morocco, Tunisia, and the northwestern portion of Libya known historically as Tripolitania.

==Geographic regions==

=== The Tell ===
The fertile Tell is the country&#x27;s heartland, containing most of its cities and population. Made up of hills and plains of the narrow coastal region, the several Tell Atlas mountain ranges, and the intermediate valleys and basins, the Tell extends eastward from the Moroccan border to the mountains of the Grande Kabylie and the Bejaia Plain on the east. Its eastern terminus is the Soummam River.

The best agricultural areas are the gentle hills extending 100 kilometers westward from Algiers; the Mitidja Plain, which was a malarial swamp before being cleared by the French; and the Bejaia Plain. The alluvial soils in these areas permitted the French to establish magnificent vineyards and citrus groves. By contrast, in the great valley of the Chelif River and other interior valleys and basins, aridity and excessive summer heat have limited the development of agriculture. The Grande Kabylie is a zone of impoverished small farm villages tucked into convoluted mountains.

===The High Plateaus and the Saharan Atlas===

Stretching from the Moroccan border the Tell Atlas, including the Djebel Babor formation, is the dominant northwestern mountain range. Stretching more than 600 kilometers eastward from the Moroccan border, the high plateau area (often referred to by the French name &quot;Hautes Plaines&quot; or &quot;Hauts Plateaux&quot;) consist of undulating, steppe-like plains lying between the Tell and Saharan Atlas ranges. The elevation averages between in elevation in the west, dropping to in the east. The climate is so dry that these plains are sometimes thought of as part of the Sahara. The plateau area is covered by alluvial debris formed when the mountains eroded. An occasional ridge projects through the alluvial cover to interrupt the monotony of the landscape.

Higher and more continuous than the Tell Atlas, the Sahara Atlas range is formed of three massifs: the Ksour Range near the Moroccan border, the Amour Range, and the Ouled-Naïl Range south of Algiers. The mountains, which receive more rainfall than those of the High Plateaus, include some good grazing land. Watercourses on the southern slopes of these massifs disappear into the desert but supply the wells of numerous oases along the northern edge of the desert, of which Biskra, Laghouat, and Béchar are the most prominent.

===Northeastern Algeria===
Eastern Algeria consists of a massif area extensively dissected into mountains, plains, and basins. It differs from the western portion of the country in that its prominent topographic features do not parallel the coast. In its southern sector, the steep cliffs and long ridges of the Aurès Mountains create an almost impenetrable refuge that has played an important part in the history of the Maghrib since Roman times. Near the northern coast, the Petite Kabylie Mountains are separated from the Grande Kabylie range at the eastward limits of the Tell by the Soummam River. The coast is predominantly mountainous in the far eastern part of the country, but limited plains provide hinterlands for the port cities of Bejaïa, Skikda, and Annaba. In the interior of the region, extensive high plains mark the region around Sétif and Constantine; these plains were developed during the French colonial period as the principal centers of grain cultivation. Near Constantine, salt marshes offer seasonal grazing grounds to seminomadic sheep herders.

===The Sahara===
The Algerian portion of the Sahara extends south of the Saharan Atlas for to the Niger and Mali frontiers. The desert is an otherworldly place, scarcely considered an integral part of the country. Far from being covered wholly by sweeps of sand, however, it is a region of great diversity. Immense areas of sand dunes called areg (sing., erg) occupy about one-quarter of the territory. The largest such region is the Grand Erg Oriental (Great Eastern Erg), where enormous dunes high are spaced about apart. Much of the remainder of the desert is covered by rocky platforms called humud (sing., hamada), and almost the entire southeastern quarter is taken up by the high, complex mass of the Ahaggar and Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer highlands, some parts of which reach more than . Surrounding the Ahaggar are sandstone plateaus, cut into deep gorges by ancient rivers, and to the west a desert of pebbles stretches to the Mali frontier.

The desert consists of readily distinguishable northern and southern sectors, the northern sector extending southward a little less than half the distance to the Niger and Mali frontiers. The north, less arid than the south, supports most of the few persons who live in the region and contains most of the desert&#x27;s oases. Sand dunes are the most prominent features of this area&#x27;s topography, but between the desert areas of the Grand Erg Oriental and the Grand Erg Occidental (Great Western Erg) and extending north to the Atlas Saharien are plateaus, including the Tademaït and a complex limestone structure called the M&#x27;zab where the Mozabite Berbers have settled. The southern zone of the Sahara is almost totally arid and is inhabited only by the Tuareg nomads and, recently, by oil camp workers. Barren rock predominates, but in some parts of Ahaggar and Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer alluvial deposits permit garden farming.

==Climate and hydrology==

Northern Algeria is in the temperate zone and enjoys a mild, Mediterranean climate. It lies within approximately the same latitudes as southern California and has somewhat similar climatic conditions. Its broken topography, however, provides sharp local contrasts in both prevailing temperatures and incidence of rainfall. Year-to-year variations in climatic conditions are also common. This area, the most inhabited in Algeria, is commonly referred to as the Tell.

In the Tell, temperatures in summer average between and in winter drop to . Winters are not cold, but the humidity is high and houses are seldom adequately heated. In eastern Algeria, the average temperatures are somewhat lower, and on the steppes of the High Plateaus winter temperatures hover only a few degrees above freezing. A prominent feature of the climate in this region is the sirocco, a dusty, choking south wind blowing off the desert, sometimes at gale force. This wind also occasionally reaches into the coastal Tell.

In Algeria only a relatively small corner of the Sahara lies across the Tropic of Cancer in the torrid zone, but even in winter, midday desert temperatures can be very hot. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

Rainfall is fairly abundant along the coastal part of the Tell, ranging from annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. Precipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as in some years. Farther inland the rainfall is less plentiful. Prevailing winds that are easterly and northeasterly in summer change to westerly and northerly in winter and carry with them a general increase in precipitation from September to December, a decrease in the late winter and spring months, and a near absence of rainfall during the summer months.


==Terrain==

Clearing of land for agricultural use and cutting of timber over the centuries have severely reduced the once bountiful forest wealth. Forest fires have also taken their toll. In the higher and wetter portions of the Tell Atlas, cork oak and Aleppo pine grow in thick soils. At lower levels on thinner soils, drought-resistant shrubs predominate. The grapevine is indigenous to the coastal lowlands, and grasses and scrub cover the High Plateaus. On the Saharan Atlas, little survives of the once extensive forests of Atlas cedar that have been exploited for fuel and timber since antiquity.

The forest reserves in Algeria were severely reduced during the colonial period. In 1967 it was calculated that the country&#x27;s forested area extended over no more than of terrain, of which were overgrown with brushwood and scrub. By contrast, woodlands in 1830 had covered . In the mid-1970s, however, the government embarked on a vast reforestation program to help control erosion, which was estimated to affect of arable land annually. Among projects was one to create a barrage vert (green barrier) more or less following the ridge line of the Saharan Atlas and extending from Morocco to the Tunisian frontier in a zone long and up to wide.

In Algeria forest cover is around 1% of the total land area, equivalent to 1,949,000 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, up from 1,667,000 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 1,439,000 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 510,000 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 6% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 80% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership, 18% private ownership and 2% with ownership listed as other or unknown.

The barrage vert consists principally of Aleppo pine, a species that can thrive in areas of scanty rainfall. It is designed to restore a damaged ecological balance and to halt the northern encroachment of the Sahara. By the early 1980s, the desert had already penetrated the hilly gap between the Saharan Atlas and the Aurès Mountains as far as the town of Bou Saâda, a point well within the High Plateaus region. The barrage vert project was ended in the late 1980s because of lack of funds.

Algeria had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.22/10, ranking it 106th globally out of 172 countries.

<text>Politics of Algeria takes place in a framework of a constitutional semi-presidential republic, whereby the President of Algeria is head of state while the Prime Minister of Algeria is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the People&#x27;s National Assembly and the Council of the Nation.

Since the early 1990s, a shift from a socialist to a free market economy has been ongoing with official support.

==History==
The civil war resulted in more than 100,000 deaths since 1991. However, Algerians believe that the national death count was close to 3,000,000. Although the security situation in the country has greatly improved, addressing the underlying issues which brought about the political turmoil of the 1990s remains the government&#x27;s major task. The government officially lifted the state of emergency declared in 1999.

==Constitution==
Under the 1976 Constitution (as modified 1979, and amended in 1988, 1989, and 1996) Algeria is a multi-party state. All parties must be approved by the Ministry of the Interior. To date, Algeria has had more than 40 legal political parties. According to the Constitution, no political association may be formed if it is &quot;based on differences in religion, language, race, gender, or region.&quot;

==Executive branch==

The head of state is the President of the republic, who is elected to a five-year term, renewable once (changed by the 2008 Constitution to an infinite mandate but reinstated in 2016). Algeria has universal suffrage. The President is the head of the Council of Ministers and of the High Security Council. He appoints the Prime Minister who also is the head of government. The Prime Minister appoints the Council of Ministers.

==Parliament of Algeria==
===People&#x27;s National Assembly===
The People&#x27;s National Assembly has less power relative to the executive branch than many parliaments and has been described as &quot;rubber-stamping&quot; laws proposed by the president.

As of 2012 there were 462 seats in parliament. In the May 2012 election the government reported a 42.9% turnout, though the BBC reported that correspondents saw &quot;only a trickle of voters&quot; at polling places. In that election 44 political parties participated with the ruling National Liberation Front winning more than any other group—220 seats—and an alliance of moderate Islamists coming in second with 66 seats. The Islamists disputed the results.

===Council of the Nation===
==Political parties and elections==

In keeping with its amended Constitution, the Algerian Government espouses participatory democracy and free-market competition. The government has stated that it will continue to open the political process and encourage the creation of political institutions. More than 40 political parties, representing a wide segment of the population, are currently active in Algerian national politics. The most recent legislative election was 2017. President Bouteflika pledged to restructure the state as part of his overall reform efforts. However, no specifics are yet available as to how such reforms would affect political structures and the political process itself.

In the 2002 elections, there were 17,951,127 eligible voters, and 8,288,536 of them actually voted which made a turn out of 46.17%. Out of the ballots cast, there were 867,669 void ballots according to the Interior ministry and 7,420,867 which went to the various candidates.

===Legislative elections===
The most recent legislative election now is the 2017 one:
===Presidential elections===
==Administrative divisions==
Algeria is divided into 58 wilaya (province) headed by walis (governors) who report to the Minister of Interior. Each wilaya is further divided into daïras, themselves divided in communes. The wilayas and communes are each governed by an elected assembly.

==Media==
Algeria has more than 30 daily newspapers published in French and Arabic, with a total publication run of more than 1.5 million copies. Although relatively free to write as they choose, in 2001, the government amended the penal code provisions relating to defamation and slander, a step widely viewed as an effort to rein in the press. Government monopoly of newsprint and advertising is seen as another means to influence the press, although it has permitted newspapers to create their own printing distribution networks.

<doc id="40232" wikidata="Q585159" url="?curid=40232" title="Steve Goodman">
<text>Steven Benjamin Goodman (July 25, 1948 – September 20, 1984) was an American folk and country singer-songwriter from Chicago. He wrote the song &quot;City of New Orleans&quot;, which was recorded by artists including Arlo Guthrie, John Denver, The Highwaymen, and Judy Collins. In 1985, Goodman received the Grammy songwriter award for best country song. Goodman co-wrote &quot;You Never Even Called Me by My Name&quot;, which became the best-selling song of country musician David Allan Coe. A lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, Goodman wrote &quot;Go Cubs Go.&quot; Goodman died of leukemia in September 1984.

==Personal life==

Goodman was born on Chicago&#x27;s North Side to a middle-class Jewish family. He began writing and performing songs as a teenager. He graduated from Maine East High School in Park Ridge, Illinois, in 1965, where he was a classmate of Hillary Clinton. During high school he began his public singing career by leading the junior choir at Temple Beth Israel in Albany Park. In the fall of 1965, he entered the University of Illinois and pledged the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. In college he formed a cover band called The Juicy Fruits, with Goodman on lead guitar, Ron Banyon on rhythm guitar, Steve Hartmann on bass, and Elliot Englehardt on drums. He left college after one year to pursue his musical career. In the early spring of 1967, Goodman went to New York, staying for a month in a Greenwich Village brownstone across the street from the Cafe Wha?, where he performed regularly.

Returning to Chicago, he intended to restart his education. In 1968 Goodman began performing at the Earl of Old Town and The Dangling Conversation coffeehouse and attracted a following. By 1969, Goodman was a regular performer in Chicago, while attending Lake Forest College. During this time Goodman supported himself by singing advertising jingles. It was during this time he discovered the cause of his continuous fatigue was actually leukemia. This led him to drop out of school again to pursue his music full-time.

In September 1969 he met Nancy Pruter (sister of R&amp;B writer Robert Pruter), who was attending college and working as a waitress. They were married in February 1970. Though he experienced periods of remission, Goodman never felt that he was living on anything other than borrowed time, and some critics, listeners and friends have said that his music reflects this sentiment. His wife, writing in the liner notes to the posthumous collection &quot;No Big Surprise&quot;, characterized him this way:

Basically, Steve was exactly who he appeared to be: an ambitious, well-adjusted man from a loving, middle-class Jewish home in the Chicago suburbs, whose life and talent were directed by the physical pain and time constraints of a fatal disease which he kept at bay, at times, seemingly by willpower alone... Steve wanted to live as normal a life as possible, only he had to live it as fast as he could... He extracted meaning from the mundane.

==Career==

Goodman&#x27;s songs first appeared on &quot;Gathering at The Earl of Old Town&quot;, an album produced by Chicago record company Dunwich in 1971. As a close friend of Earl Pionke, the owner of the folk music bar, Goodman performed at The Earl dozens of times, including customary New Year&#x27;s Eve concerts. He also remained closely involved with Chicago&#x27;s Old Town School of Folk Music, where he had met and mentored his friend, John Prine.

Later in 1971, Goodman was playing at a Chicago bar called the Quiet Knight as the opening act for Kris Kristofferson. Impressed with Goodman, Kristofferson introduced him to Paul Anka, who brought Goodman to New York to record some demos. This resulted in Goodman signing a contract with Buddah Records.

All this time, Goodman had been busy writing many of his most enduring songs, and this avid songwriting would lead to an important break for him. While at the Quiet Knight, Goodman saw Arlo Guthrie and asked him to let him play a song for him. Guthrie grudgingly agreed on the condition that Goodman buy him a beer first; Guthrie would then listen to Goodman for as long as it took Guthrie to drink the beer. Goodman played &quot;City of New Orleans&quot;, which Guthrie liked enough that he asked to record it.

Guthrie&#x27;s version of Goodman&#x27;s song, about the Illinois Central&#x27;s &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; train, became a Top 20 hit in 1972 and provided Goodman with enough financial and artistic success to make music a full-time career. The song would become an American standard, covered by such musicians as Johnny Cash, Judy Collins, Chet Atkins, Lynn Anderson, and Willie Nelson, whose recorded version earned Goodman a posthumous Grammy for Best Country Song in 1985. A French translation of the song, &quot;Salut Les Amoureux&quot;, was recorded by Joe Dassin in 1973.

A Dutch singer, Gerard Cox, heard the French version while on holiday and translated it into Dutch, titled &quot;&#x27;t Is Weer Voorbij Die Mooie Zomer&quot; (&quot;And again that beautiful summer has come to an end&quot;). It reached number one on the Dutch Top 40 in December 1973 and has become a classic which is still played on Dutch radio. Inspired by this version Rudi Carrell, a Dutch TV host and entertainer who was also very successful in Germany, covered the song with German lyrics (&quot;Wann wird&#x27;s mal wieder richtig Sommer?&quot;) in 1975. It peaked #18 in the Top 40 and has become a radio classic which gains airplay in rainy summers. A Hebrew version of the song &quot;Shalom Lach Eretz Nehederet&quot; was sung by famous Israeli singer Yehoram Gaon in 1977 and became an immediate hit. Lyrically, the French, Dutch, German and Hebrew versions bear no resemblance to Goodman&#x27;s original lyrics. 

According to Goodman, the song was inspired by a train trip he and his wife took from Chicago to Mattoon, Illinois. According to the liner notes on the Steve Goodman anthology &quot;No Big Surprise&quot;, &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; was written while on the campaign trail with Senator Edmund Muskie.

In 1974, singer David Allan Coe achieved considerable success on the country charts with Goodman&#x27;s and John Prine&#x27;s &quot;You Never Even Called Me by My Name&quot;, a song which good-naturedly spoofed stereotypical country music lyrics. Prine refused to take a songwriter&#x27;s credit for the song, although Goodman bought Prine a jukebox as a gift from his publishing royalties. Goodman&#x27;s name is mentioned in Coe&#x27;s recording of the song, in a spoken epilogue in which Goodman and Coe discuss the merits of &quot;the perfect country and western song&quot;.

Goodman&#x27;s success as a recording artist was more limited. Although he was known in folk circles as an excellent and influential songwriter, his albums received more critical than commercial success. One of Goodman&#x27;s biggest hits was a song he didn&#x27;t write: &quot;The Dutchman&quot;, written by Michael Peter Smith. He reached a wider audience as the opening act for Steve Martin while Martin was at the height of his stand-up popularity.

During the mid and late seventies, Goodman became a regular guest on Easter Sunday on Vin Scelsa&#x27;s radio show in New York City. Scelsa&#x27;s personal recordings of these sessions eventually led to an album of selections from these appearances, &quot;The Easter Tapes&quot;.

In 1977, Goodman performed on Tom Paxton&#x27;s live album &quot;New Songs From the Briarpatch&quot; (Vanguard Records), which contained some of Paxton&#x27;s topical songs of the 1970s, including &quot;Talking Watergate&quot; and &quot;White Bones of Allende&quot;, as well as a song dedicated to Mississippi John Hurt entitled &quot;Did You Hear John Hurt?&quot;

During the fall of 1979, Goodman was hired to write and perform a series of topical songs for National Public Radio. Although Goodman and Jethro Burns recorded eleven songs for the series, only five of them, &quot;The Ballad of Flight 191&quot; about a plane crash, &quot;Daley&#x27;s Gone&quot;, &quot;Unemployed&quot;, &quot;The Twentieth Century is Almost Over&quot;, and &quot;The Election Year Rag&quot;, were used on the air before the series was cancelled.

Goodman wrote and performed many humorous songs about Chicago, including three about the Chicago Cubs: &quot;A Dying Cub Fan&#x27;s Last Request&quot;, &quot;When the Cubs Go Marching In&quot; and &quot;Go, Cubs, Go&quot; (which has frequently been played on Cubs broadcasts and at Wrigley Field after Cubs wins). He wrote &quot;Go, Cubs, Go&quot; out of spite after then GM Dallas Green called &quot;A Dying Cub Fan&#x27;s Last Request&quot; too depressing. The Cubs songs grew out of his fanatical devotion to the team, which included many clubhouse and on-field visits with Cubs players. He wrote other songs about Chicago, including &quot;The Lincoln Park Pirates&quot;, about the notorious Lincoln Towing Service, and &quot;Daley&#x27;s Gone&quot;, about Mayor Richard J. Daley. Another comic highlight is &quot;Vegematic&quot;, about a man who falls asleep while watching late-night TV and dreams he ordered many products that he saw on infomercials. He could also write serious songs, most notably &quot;My Old Man&quot;, a tribute to Goodman&#x27;s father, Bud Goodman, a used-car salesman and World War II veteran.

Goodman won his second Grammy, for Best Contemporary Folk Album, in 1988 for &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;, a posthumous album on his Red Pajamas Records label.

Many fans become aware of Goodman&#x27;s work through other artists such as Jimmy Buffett. Buffett has recorded several of Goodman&#x27;s songs, including &quot;This Hotel Room&quot;, &quot;Banana Republics&quot;, and &quot;California Promises&quot;, as well as songs co-written with Buffett: &quot;Door Number Three&quot;, &quot;Woman Goin&#x27; Crazy on Caroline Street&quot;, &quot;Frank and Lola&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Midnight and I&#x27;m not Famous Yet&quot;, and &quot;Where&#x27;s the Party?&quot;. Jackie DeShannon covered Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Would You Like to Learn to Dance&quot; on her 1972 album, &quot;Jackie&quot;.

Goodman&#x27;s posthumously released album, &quot;Santa Ana Winds&quot;, included a tribute to Carl Martin, &quot;You Better Get It While You Can (The Ballad of Carl Martin)&quot;, celebrating the joy both found in their music, and a refrain of, &quot;From the cradle to the crypt, Is a mighty short trip. So you better get it while you can&quot;.

==Death==

On September 20, 1984, Goodman died of leukemia at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, Washington. He was 36 years old.

On October 2, after clinching the National League East division title, the Cubs played their first post-season game since the 1945 World Series. Filling in for Goodman, who had been scheduled to sing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before the game, Jimmy Buffett dedicated the song to him. Since the 2000s, at the conclusion of every home game win, the Cubs play &quot;Go, Cubs, Go&quot;, written by Goodman.

In April 1988, some of Goodman&#x27;s ashes were scattered at Wrigley Field, the home of the Cubs.

Goodman was survived by his wife and three daughters.

==Legacy==
In 2006, Goodman&#x27;s daughter, Rosanna, issued &quot;My Old Man&quot;, an album of a variety of artists covering her father&#x27;s songs.

In 2007 the Chicago Cubs began playing Goodman&#x27;s 1984 song &quot;Go, Cubs, Go&quot; after each home game win. When the Cubs made it to the playoffs, interest in the song and Goodman resulted in several newspaper articles about him. Illinois Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn declared October 5, 2007, Steve Goodman Day in the state. In 2010, Illinois Representative Mike Quigley introduced a bill renaming the Lakeview post office on Irving Park Road in honor of Goodman. The bill was signed by President Barack Obama on August 3, 2010.

<doc id="40233" wikidata="Q745741" url="?curid=40233" title="Madness (band)">
<text>Madness are an English ska and pop band from Camden Town, north west London, who formed in 1976. One of the most prominent bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s two-tone ska revival, they continue to perform with six of the seven members of their original line-up. Madness&#x27;s most successful period was from 1980 to 1986, when the band&#x27;s songs spent a total of 214 weeks on the UK Singles Chart, holding the record along with English reggae group UB40 for most weeks spent by a group in the UK singles chart during the 1980s.

Madness have had 16 singles reach the UK top ten, including &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, &quot;Baggy Trousers&quot; and &quot;It Must Be Love&quot;, one UK number-one single &quot;House of Fun&quot; and two number ones in Ireland, &quot;House of Fun&quot; and &quot;Wings of a Dove&quot;. &quot;Our House&quot; was their biggest US hit, reaching number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 2000, the band received the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors for Outstanding Song Collection.

==Career==
=== 1976–1978: Formation ===
The core of the band formed as the North London Invaders in 1976, and included Mike Barson (Monsieur Barso) on keyboards and vocals, Chris Foreman (Chrissy Boy) on guitar and Lee Thompson (Kix) on saxophone and vocals. They later recruited John Hasler on drums and Cathal Smyth (better known as Chas Smash) on bass guitar. Later in the year, they were joined by lead vocalist Dikran Tulaine.

This six-piece line-up lasted until part-way through 1977, when Graham McPherson (better known as Suggs) took over the lead vocals after seeing the band perform in a friend&#x27;s garden. Tulaine went on to be an actor. Smyth, who left after an argument with Barson, was replaced by Gavin Rodgers, Barson&#x27;s girlfriend&#x27;s brother. McPherson was kicked out of the band for choosing too often to watch Chelsea instead of rehearsing. Thompson left the band after Barson criticised his saxophone playing.

By 1978, the band had allowed McPherson to return as a vocalist after he had filled in temporarily for Hasler (who had taken over vocals when McPherson was removed). Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson. Drummer Dan Woodgate (Woody) and bassist Mark Bedford (Bedders) also joined the band, replacing Garry Dovey and Rodgers, respectively. After briefly changing their name to Morris and the Minors, the band renamed itself as Madness in 1979, paying homage to one of their favourite songs by ska and reggae artist Prince Buster. The band remained a sextet until late 1979 when Chas Smash rejoined and officially became the seventh member of Madness as a backing vocalist and dancer.

===1979–1981: Early success===

During 1979, the band began to attract a live following in London, being regulars at the Dublin Castle in Camden Town. The band&#x27;s first commercial recording was the Lee Thompson composition &quot;The Prince&quot;. The song, like the band&#x27;s name, paid homage to their idol, Prince Buster. The song was released through 2 Tone Records, the label of the Specials founder and keyboardist Jerry Dammers. The song was a surprise hit, peaking in the UK music charts at number 16. Madness toured with fellow 2 Tone bands the Specials and the Selecter, before recording their debut studio album.

That debut studio album, &quot;One Step Beyond...&quot; was released by Stiff Records. The album included a re-recording of &quot;The Prince&quot; and its B-side &quot;Madness&quot;, and the band&#x27;s second and third singles: &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; and &quot;My Girl&quot;. The title song was a cover of the B-side of the 1960s Prince Buster hit &quot;Al Capone&quot;. The &quot;One Step Beyond...&quot; album stayed in the British charts for 78 weeks, peaking at number 2. Smyth performed on the album but was not an official member of the band at the time of the album&#x27;s recording or release. He would formally join Madness a few weeks after &quot;One Step Beyond...&quot; was issued in October 1979.

After the release of &quot;My Girl&quot;, the band felt that they had exhausted the material from &quot;One Step Beyond...&quot;, and did not want to release any more singles from the album. However, Dave Robinson, head of Stiff Records, disagreed. Eventually, a compromise was made, and the band decided to release an EP featuring one album track and three new tracks. The result was the &quot;Work Rest and Play&quot; EP, which was headlined by the song &quot;Night Boat to Cairo&quot;, from the &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; album. The EP reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart.

In 1980, the band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Absolutely&quot; reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Absolutely&quot; spawned some of the band&#x27;s biggest hits, most notably &quot;Baggy Trousers&quot;, which peaked at number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Embarrassment&quot; reached number 4 in the charts, and the instrumental song &quot;The Return of the Los Palmas 7&quot; climbed to number 7. Although the album reviews were generally less enthusiastic than those of &quot;One Step Beyond...&quot;, they were mostly positive. Robert Christgau gave the album a favourable B− grade, but &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarded the album just one out of five stars. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was particularly scathing of the ska revival in general, stating that &quot;&quot;The Specials&quot; wasn&#x27;t very good&quot; and Madness were simply &quot;the Blues Brothers with English accents&quot;.

A drama-documentary film titled &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; was released in 1981, featuring the band members playing themselves in a re-creation of their early days to the then-current period. Live recordings of Madness performances as well as those by other 2 Tone bands were used in the 1981 documentary film and soundtrack album &quot;Dance Craze&quot;.

===1981–1983: Change of direction===
In 1981, the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;7&quot;, reached number 5 in the UK Albums Chart and contained three hit singles: &quot;Grey Day&quot; (no. 4, April 1981), &quot;Shut Up&quot; (no. 7, September 1981), and &quot;Cardiac Arrest&quot; (no. 14, February 1982). In an article in 1979, Chris Foreman explained that the band&#x27;s music would move with the times, and change styles as time goes on. This was shown to be the case, as unlike the two ska-filled, fast-paced albums that preceded it, &quot;7&quot; was something of a change in direction. Suggs&#x27; vocal performance changed significantly, and his strong accent from the previous studio albums had been watered down. The album strayed from the ska-influenced sound of &quot;One Step Beyond...&quot; and &quot;Absolutely&quot; and moved towards a pop sound; a trend that continued with subsequent studio albums.

Near the end of 1981, Madness released one of their most recognised songs: a cover of Labi Siffre&#x27;s 1971 hit &quot;It Must Be Love&quot;. The song climbed to number 4 in the UK, and in 1983, the song peaked at number 33 in the US charts. In 1982, Madness released their only number 1 hit to date, &quot;House of Fun&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sony/ATV&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and also reached number 1 in the album charts with their first compilation, &quot;Complete Madness&quot; (1982).

In November 1982, they released their fourth studio album, &quot;The Rise &amp; Fall&quot;, which was well received in the UK, but did not get an American release. Instead, many of its songs were included on the US compilation &quot;Madness&quot; (1983), including &quot;Our House&quot;, which was their most internationally successful single to date. &quot;Our House&quot; reached number 5 in the UK music charts and number 7 in the US charts; it was also performed on &quot;The Young Ones&quot;. Many reviewers compared &quot;The Rise &amp; Fall&quot; to the Kinks&#x27; &quot;The Village Green Preservation Society&quot; (1968), and it is at times retrospectively considered a concept album. The album also featured &quot;Primrose Hill&quot;, which was more similar to the Beatles song &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, containing similar psychedelic imagery and a layered arrangement.

===1983–1986: Decline and break-up===

In 1983, their single &quot;Wings of a Dove&quot; peaked at number 2 in the UK charts, followed by &quot;The Sun and the Rain&quot; (no. 5, November 1983). Their following studio album, &quot;Keep Moving&quot;, peaked at number 6 in the UK Albums Chart, and two singles from that album reached the top 20 in the UK Singles Chart. The album received some good reviews, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine giving the album four out of five stars, applauding the band&#x27;s changing sound. This was an improvement as the last album reviewed by the magazine, &quot;Absolutely&quot;, was heavily criticised.

On 5 October 1983 the band were rehearsing and discussing a possible television series, which was being written for them by Ben Elton and Richard Curtis. Barson then informed the band that he would not be able to take part, as he was tired of the music business and wanted to spend more time with his wife. They had recently relocated to Amsterdam. Barson agreed to finish recording the album &quot;Keep Moving;&quot; he left after playing for the last time with the band at the Lyceum Ballroom on 21 December 1983. James Mackie took Barson&#x27;s place appearing with Madness on the US television show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on 14 April 1984. After leaving the band, Barson returned to the UK for the filming of two music videos as he had played on the tracks, &quot;Michael Caine&quot; and &quot;One Better Day&quot;. Barson finished live performance with the band in 1983, and officially left the band in June 1984, following the release of &quot;One Better Day&quot;. Paul Carrack took Barson&#x27;s place whilst the band toured America in early 1984. The six remaining members left Stiff Records and formed their own label, Zarjazz Records, which was a sub-label of Virgin Records.

In 1985, the label released the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Mad Not Mad&quot;. Barson&#x27;s usual keyboard parts were filled by an emphasis on synthesisers provided by Steve Nieve of the Attractions. In later years, frontman Suggs has described the album as a &quot;polished turd&quot;. The album reached number 16 in the UK charts, which is the band&#x27;s lowest position on the album charts to date. Despite the poor chart showing, the album was listed as number 55 in &quot;NME&quot;″s &quot;All Time 100 Albums&quot;. The singles for the album fared even worse, with &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Men&quot; peaking at number 18 in the UK charts. The subsequent singles, &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; and &quot;Sweetest Girl&quot;, failed to make the top 20, which was a first for Madness singles.

The band then attempted to record a new studio album, and 11 demo tracks were recorded. However, musical differences arose between the band members. The untitled album went unreleased, and in September 1986, the band announced that they were to break-up. Barson rejoined the band for a farewell single, &quot;(Waiting For) The Ghost Train&quot;, but did not appear in the music video. The band officially broke up following the release of the single, which reached a high of number 18 in the UK. In 1988, four members of the band – Suggs, Chas Smash, Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman – continued under the name The Madness. After one self-titled studio album and two singles that failed to make the top 40, the band broke up.

===1992–2003: Reunion and &quot;Our House&quot; musical===
Towards the end of 1991, &quot;It Must Be Love&quot; was re-released and eventually reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1992. Following that, the singles compilation album &quot;Divine Madness&quot; (1992) was released and peaked at number 1 in the album charts. Madness then announced plans for a reunion concert, Madstock!, which was held at Finsbury Park, London on 8 and 9 August of that year. The original line-up reunited, performing together for the first time since Barson left the band in 1984. Over 75,000 fans attended the weekend festival, and the dancing of the crowd caused some nearby tower blocks to shake perceptibly as they resonated with the frequency of the music.

After the Finsbury Park comeback, a live album was released, and the associated single, &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; (a cover of Jimmy Cliff&#x27;s 1973 song) reached number 44 in the UK, with the album reaching number 22.

The band continued to reunite for annual UK Christmas season tours and held three more Madstock! festivals; in 1994, 1996 and 1998. Also in 1998, Madness returned to America for their first tour there since 1984. The live album &quot;Universal Madness&quot; was recorded at the Universal Amphitheatre in L.A. and released the following year. In 1999, Madness released their first studio album since 1986, entitled &quot;Wonderful&quot;. The album reached number 17 in the UK Albums Chart, and the lead single, &quot;Lovestruck&quot;, gave the band their first new top 10 hit in the UK since 1983. Neither of the two subsequent singles from the album, &quot;Johnny the Horse&quot; and &quot;Drip Fed Fred&quot; (featuring Ian Dury on vocals), entered the top 40 of the UK chart.

From 28 October 2002 to 16 August 2003, a musical based on Madness songs, &quot;Our House&quot;, ran at the Cambridge Theatre in London. Madness played a role in the executive production of the show, and Suggs played a role in the production for a period, playing the central character&#x27;s father. It won an Olivier Award for best new musical of 2003, and the performance was released on DVD on 1 November 2004. There was also a previous musical based on Madness songs, &quot;One Step Beyond!&quot;, written by Alan Gilbey. The musical had a brief run at the Theatre Royal Stratford East in 1993 and a run at Putney Arts Theatre, London in 2012.

=== 2004–2010: The Dangermen and &quot;The Liberty of Norton Folgate&quot; ===

In 2004, the band played a series of low-key concerts as the Dangermen, performing covers of classic reggae and ska songs. A lot of the songs were those played by the band when they were first forming, and the band performed the songs as a celebration of their 25th anniversary.

This led to the release of the cover album &quot;The Dangermen Sessions Vol. 1&quot; in August 2005 by V2 Records. During the sessions which produced the album, in mid-2005, guitarist Chris Foreman announced his departure, citing &quot;the petty, time consuming bollocks that goes on in the band&quot; as his reason for leaving. The band completed the album without him, and on release, it peaked at no. 11 in the UK Albums Chart, which was the band&#x27;s highest studio album chart position in 21 years. Although two singles were released, neither was a major success in the UK. The more successful of the two, &quot;Shame &amp; Scandal&quot;, reached number 38, but was more successful in France where it peaked at number 12. &quot;Girl Why Don&#x27;t You&quot; did not chart and the band left the V2 record label shortly after. At this time, Kevin Burdette joined as the band&#x27;s guitarist for live appearances and also appeared in the videos for both &quot;Sorry&quot; and &quot;NW5&quot; in early 2007.

The six remaining original members of Madness began working on their first original studio album in seven years. In March 2007, the non-LP single &quot;Sorry&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s own record label Lucky 7 Records, peaking in the UK charts at number 23. The single included a version featuring UK hip hop artists Sway DaSafo and Baby Blue.

The new Madness song &quot;NW5&quot; (then still titled &quot;NW5 (I Would Give You Everything)&quot;) and a re-recorded version of &quot;It Must Be Love&quot; were featured in the German film &quot;&quot;. The two songs were released in Germany as a double A-side, and both of them were turned into music videos, which – besides members of the film&#x27;s cast – featured Suggs, Chas Smash, Woody and stand-in guitarist Burdette. A re-recorded version of &quot;NW5&quot; was released as a single on 14 January 2008 in the UK reaching no. 24 – this recording featured original Madness guitarist Chris Foreman, who had rejoined the band in time for the 2006 Christmas tour but had not participated in the original recording of the song.

In June 2008, Madness played the majority of their new studio album &quot;The Liberty of Norton Folgate&quot; at London&#x27;s Hackney Empire for three nights. The Hackney Empire performances were recorded and sold to fans on USB wristbands as they left the show. Madness played two dates in December 2008, firstly in Manchester on 18 December, and secondly a return gig to The O2 in London on the 19th.

In December 2008 the band also announced that for their thirtieth anniversary in 2009, they would be staging a fifth Madstock Festival in London&#x27;s Victoria Park on 17 July, 11 years after the last Madstock concert. It was originally rumoured that the newly reformed the Specials would make an appearance after finishing their reunion tour. However, this did not occur, although original Specials keyboardist Jerry Dammers – who was not part of the reunion line-up – was announced as a support act with the Spatial AKA Orchestra shortly before the festival. Dammers supported Madness again during their 2009 Christmas tour when he opened each night with a DJ set.

Through late March and early April 2009, the band played a series of festival and separate headlining dates across Australia. The lead-up single from their latest studio album, titled &quot;Dust Devil&quot;, was released on 11 May on Lucky 7 Records. Actors Alfie Allen and Jaime Winstone co-starred in the music video. The single charted at No. 64 on the UK Singles Chart and at No. 1 on the UK Independent charts on 17 May 2009.

The new studio album, entitled &quot;The Liberty of Norton Folgate&quot;, was released a week later, on 18 May 2009. It charted at No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart. The band continued to play various festivals, including Pinkpop, Splendour, and Glastonbury. On 27 September 2009, the band also played a free concert on a closed-off Regent Street in association with Absolute Radio.

On 28 August, Madness played the Rock en Seine festival near Paris, on the same night where Oasis brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher engaged in a physical altercation, resulting in the break-up of the band. As Oasis cancelled their headlining slot, Madness, even though having played earlier in the evening, were asked to replace them. They accepted the invitation and both of their sets during the festival were said to have been well received.

As in previous years, the band embarked on a Christmas tour of the UK (also playing one concert in Dublin), playing at various medium-sized venues. Mark Bedford took a break from the band and was replaced by Graham Bush for the tour.

Some members of the band appeared in Catherine Tate&#x27;s &quot;Nan&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;. They first posed as carol singers, then played &quot;Baggy Trousers&quot; over the credits. On 18 January 2010, Madness released a fourth single, &quot;Forever Young&quot;, from &quot;The Liberty of Norton Folgate&quot;. The single failed to chart.

During an interview with RTÉ 2fm radio host Dave Fanning on 24 May 2010, drummer Daniel Woodgate stated that the members of the band were in the final stages of preparing songs for the follow-up to &quot;The Liberty of Norton Folgate&quot;. The band hoped to be able to start recording the album later on in 2010.

In September 2010, Madness were awarded the Idol Award at the Q Awards in London. Guitarist Chris Foreman stated in his acceptance speech that Madness were recording a new album.

Madness toured the UK throughout November and December 2010 with their final show at London&#x27;s Earl&#x27;s Court, where they played a new song from their upcoming album. However, two concerts, in Hull and Sheffield, were cancelled due to heavy snowfall, although they were later rescheduled for 5 and 6 February 2011 respectively.

===2011–2015: &quot;Oui Oui, Si Si, Ja Ja, Da Da&quot;===
In June 2011, the band performed at Meltdown Festival at the Royal Festival Hall, curated by inspiration Ray Davies of the Kinks, who also introduced the band on stage. The concert served as the premiere of three new songs – &quot;1978&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Keep a Good Thing Down&quot; and &quot;Death of a Rude Boy&quot;.
The summer of 2012 saw two notable performances. In June, the band performed at the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace. The band performed &quot;Our House&quot; and &quot;It Must Be Love&quot; from the roof of the palace with accompanying animations projected onto the palace front. In August, the band was the first to perform at the closing ceremony of the London Olympic Games. Departed bassist Bedford rejoined the band for both performances. In August 2012, Madness released &quot;Death of a Rude Boy&quot; as a free teaser track from their new studio album. Madness&#x27; tenth studio album &quot;Oui Oui, Si Si, Ja Ja, Da Da&quot; was released on 29 October 2012 and entered the UK Albums Chart at no.10. In January 2013 the album re-entered the chart at no. 16 on the back of the airplay success of the single &quot;Never Knew Your Name&quot;.

From the start of 2013, Bedford increased his performances with the band building to his full-time return to the group, which meant a close to the four years Graham Bush had spent with the band.

On 22 March 2013, the band performed outside the BBC Television Centre in a live broadcast for BBC Four. This was followed by &quot;Goodbye Television Centre&quot;, a celebration of 50 years of the television centre, marking the closure of the building and the last show to be broadcast from it. Following that the band was the closing act to the new year celebration of 2014 in Dublin, Ireland.

On 22 March 2014, Suggs confirmed that Madness were writing a new studio album which he stated &quot;the band plan to record in the summer and release by the end of 2014&quot;.

In October 2014, Cathal Smyth, aka Chas Smash, left Madness to pursue a solo career. His debut solo studio album, &quot;A Comfortable Man&quot;, was released on 11 May 2015 by Phoenix Rising Recording Co. Although Smyth&#x27;s departure was characterized at the time as a &#x27;break&#x27; to concentrate on his solo career and not necessarily a permanent departure, Smyth has not rejoined Madness in the years since the break was announced. Madness has continued as a six-piece.

===2016–2022: &quot;Can&#x27;t Touch Us Now&quot;===
The band announced their new studio album &quot;Can&#x27;t Touch Us Now&quot; in May 2016. In support of the album, the band played the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival in June. Lead single &quot;Mr. Apples&quot; was accompanied by a scripted video (first one since 2009) and A-listed by BBC Radio 2. The song &quot;Herbert&quot; was released as a taster accompanied by an animation video. Further singles &quot;Can&#x27;t Touch Us Now&quot; and &quot;Another Version of Me&quot; were also playlisted by BBC Radio 2. The album itself entered the UK Albums Chart at number 5 in November 2016. The band finished the year on a UK arena tour in December.

Throughout 2017, the band played at several festivals and concerts worldwide including mainland Europe, Asia, and Australia. In April their first Australian gig at the Fremantle Arts Centre in Western Australia sold out, necessitating a second gig the following night. In August, the band hosted their own &quot;House of Common Festival&quot; for the second year on Clapham Common. This was the band&#x27;s only London gig of the year.

In 2018, the band embarked on a summer tour of stately homes in the UK before a Christmas arena tour in December. Madness performed on New Year&#x27;s Eve through to New Year&#x27;s Day at &quot;Madness Rocks Big Ben Live&quot;. The entire performance was shown on BBC One before and after that year&#x27;s fireworks.

In March 2019, Madness announced the release of their group autobiography, &quot;Before We Was We: Madness by Madness&quot;, to be released on hardback that October. The book includes commentary from all seven members telling the story of their early days and childhoods up until their breakthrough as a group. In May 2021, the book was adapted as a three-part TV documentary on AMC, with the first part free on BT&#x27;s YouTube channel.

The band celebrated 40 years since their debut studio album release with several special live appearances throughout 2019. The band performed at their own &quot;House of Common&quot; festival in August and held a special concert with a full orchestra at Kenwood House. In November they played at Electric Ballroom in Camden; forty years to the day since one of their first appearances there. The performance was broadcast on Sky Arts in 2020. The band saw the year out with three concerts at The Roundhouse.

In December 2019, the band released a new single, &quot;Bullingdon Boys (Don&#x27;t Get Bullied by the Bully Boys)&quot;. The &quot;NME&quot; described the song as a &#x27;barbed swipe at Boris Johnson and his Eton cohorts&#x27;.

In April 2021, following some special videos created during the COVID-19 pandemic, Madness announced their first global live stream, titled &quot;The Get Up!&quot;, to be held the next month. It featured live music and comedy from the group and Charlie Higson, pre-recorded at the London Palladium. During the live stream, the band was accompanied by Roland Gift of Fine Young Cannibals and Paul Weller of the Jam and had a cameo by Queen Elizabeth II, played by Mike Barson. They announced their 2021 tour, The Ladykillers Tour, the next day, to be held alongside Squeeze.

=== 2023–present: &quot;Theatre of the Absurd Presents C&#x27;est la Vie&quot;===
In September 2023, the band announced their thirteenth studio album &quot;Theatre of the Absurd Presents C&#x27;est la Vie&quot;, which was released on 17 November 2023. It was followed by a UK tour with the Lightning Seeds, including stops in Liverpool, Manchester and London.

The album was preceded by the single &quot;C&#x27;est La Vie&quot; and &quot;Baby Burglar&quot;, a song inspired by the antics of band members in their youth, including breaking into singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul&#x27;s house. A new video featured these two singles plus a performances of &quot;Round We Go&quot;.

It would become Madness&#x27; first ever number one studio album in the UK. The album also made the album charts in Ireland, Germany and The Netherlands.

On 11 December a full version of the &quot;C&#x27;est La Vie&quot; video was released. Follow by &quot;Baby Burglar&quot; on 23 January 2024. 

In February it was announced that &quot;Round We Go&quot; would be released as the official new single. A full video was released on 6 February, followed by a single edit on February 16. On February 23 the song was added to BBC Radio 2&#x27;s New Music Playlist.

In April the enhanced version of &quot;Theatre Of The Absurd Presents C&#x27;est La Vie&quot; was announced, featuring 5 new songs and 7 unreleased live songs from the December tour, including the band&#x27;s version of The Specials&#x27;s &quot;Friday Night Saturday Morning&quot;. &quot;No Reason&quot; – written by Suggs – was made available directly. 

On 17 May – just before the band would go on their first US tour in 12 years – &quot;Hour Of Need&quot; was released as a single and went straight to the BBC Radio 2 playlist. The release was accompanied by the announcement of the &#x27;Hour Of Need&#x27; Award, for which fans could honour an unsung hero in their lives.

==Spinoff acts==
===The Fink Brothers===
The Fink Brothers were a short-lived alter ego created by Madness members Suggs and Chas Smash, working under the aliases Angel and Ratty Fink, using characters from the science fiction comic &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

;Single
===The Madness===

The Madness was a line-up of Madness without bassist Mark Bedford, drummer Daniel Woodgate and keyboardist Mike Barson, active between 1988 and 1989. Formed by Suggs, Chas Smash, Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman in 1988, they distinguished this line-up from the previous Madness line-up only by adding the word &quot;The&quot; to the band&#x27;s name. The band had held a competition to find a new name on BBC Radio 1. They decided on &#x27;The Wasp Factory&#x27; after the Iain Banks novel of the same name, but that name had already been taken by another band.

The album is notable for featuring guest performers including the Specials&#x27; Jerry Dammers, early Madness member John Hasler and Earl Falconer of UB40. It is also the first studio album produced by the band themselves under the alias &#x27;The Three Eyes&#x27;.

&quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles&quot; and many online discographies consider this band to be the same as &quot;Madness&quot;. Several of the songs on the album (&quot;4BF&quot;, &quot;Be Good Boy&quot;, &quot;Gabriels Horn&quot;, &quot;In Wonder&quot;) were reworked songs from the cancelled 1986 Madness studio album and had been performed live or demoed in 1986 before the band broke up. Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman also alluded to this view on their sole studio album &quot;Crunch!&quot; (1990), which was dedicated to &quot;the good ship Madness and all who sailed in her (1979 to 1989)&quot;.

;Singles
===The Nutty Boys===
The Nutty Boys were Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman of Madness. The name &quot;The Nutty Boys&quot; was actually the name of their studio album, while the new band was called &quot;Crunch!&quot;. The posters for their first concert mistakenly listed the band as &quot;The Nutty Boys&quot; instead of &quot;Crunch!&quot;, and the name stuck. While the members of the band Madness were nicknamed &quot;The Nutty Boys&quot; as a whole, this section lists only the work released by Thompson and Foreman under &quot;The Nutty Boys&quot; name in the early 1990s.

Crunch! were also Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman. At this point, the band formally corrected the earlier mistake and officially adopted their original name of &quot;Crunch&quot;.

;Single
==Collaborations==
Madness collaborated with Elvis Costello in 1983 on a version of their song &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s (Just Another Day)&quot;. It was released as a bonus track to the 12&quot; copy of the single. In later years, Barson stated that Costello&#x27;s &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; was the main influence on the song &quot;My Girl&quot;. For &quot;Wonderful&quot; in 1999, Ian Dury laid down vocals on the track &quot;Drip Fed Fred&quot; which was released as the last single from the album. It was Dury&#x27;s last recording before his death. Ill health prevented Dury from actively promoting the single, although he did appear on the National Lottery Show, for a later performance on &quot;TFI Friday&quot;, the song was reworked to incorporate Phill Jupitus on vocals. Live, Madness have collaborated with artists including UB40 and Prince Buster, notably at their first Madstock concert. They have also played live frequently with members of the other 2 Tone bands including the Specials. In May 2008, Suggs and Carl performed live with Pet Shop Boys at London&#x27;s Heaven collaborating on a new arrangement of &quot;My Girl&quot;, as part of a tribute evening to their former minder Dainton &#x27;The Bear&#x27; Connell, called &quot;Can You Bear It?&quot;. A few days afterwards, Pet Shop Boys posted their own version of the track on their official website.

In late 2010, the band collaborated in the &quot;Cage Against the Machine&quot; project, in which numerous artists performed John Cage&#x27;s &quot;4′33″&quot; for a charity single intended to prevent the winner of &quot;The X Factor&quot; claiming the Christmas Number 1. The title refers to the previous year&#x27;s successful campaign to get Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; to chart above &quot;X Factor&quot; winner Joe McElderry.

==Lyrical themes==
Frequent themes in Madness&#x27; songs included childhood memories (e.g., &quot;Baggy Trousers&quot;, and &quot;Our House&quot;) and petty crime (e.g., &quot;Shut Up&quot;, and &quot;Deceives the Eye&quot;). Although Madness were seen by some as somewhat of a humorous band with catchy, bouncy songs, many of their songs took a darker tone (such as the singles &quot;Grey Day&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s (Just Another Day)&quot;) and they sometimes tackled what were, at the time, controversial issues in their lyrics. &quot;Embarrassment&quot; (from the &quot;Absolutely&quot; album) was written by Lee Thompson, and reflected the unfolding turmoil following the news that his teenage sister had become pregnant and was carrying a black man&#x27;s child. Madness discussed animal testing in the song &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The band criticised the National Health Service (NHS) in &quot;Mrs. Hutchinson&quot;, which told the story of a woman who, after several misdiagnoses and mistreatment, became terminally ill. The story was based on the experiences of Mike Barson&#x27;s mother. Madness&#x27; final single prior to disbanding, &quot;(Waiting For) The Ghost Train&quot;, commented on apartheid in South Africa.

==Awards==
The band&#x27;s first notable musical award came in 1983 when Chris Foreman and Cathal Smyth won an Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Best Song&quot; for the international hit &quot;Our House&quot;. Madness received another Ivor Novello Award 17 years later for an &quot;Outstanding Song Collection&quot;. In 2005, they were awarded the Mojo &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; Award, notably for being &quot;an artist&#x27;s artist&quot;. In 2007, a campaign took place by fans of Madness for the band to be awarded a Brit Award. Many fans and critics feel they have been overlooked over their past 30 years in the music industry. In July 2009, Madness were awarded the &#x27;Silver Clef&#x27; Icon Award. In September 2010, Madness were awarded the &#x27;Idol Award&#x27; at the 2010 Q Awards in London.

<text>A magnetic mirror, also known as a magnetic trap or sometimes as a pyrotron, is a type of magnetic confinement fusion device used in fusion power to trap high temperature plasma using magnetic fields. The mirror was one of the earliest major approaches to fusion power, along with the stellarator and z-pinch machines.

In a classic magnetic mirror, a configuration of electromagnets is used to create an area with an increasing density of magnetic field lines at either end of a confinement volume. Particles approaching the ends experience an increasing force that eventually causes them to reverse direction and return to the confinement area. This mirror effect will occur only for particles within a limited range of velocities and angles of approach, while those outside the limits will escape, making mirrors inherently &quot;leaky&quot;.

An analysis of early fusion devices by Edward Teller pointed out that the basic mirror concept is inherently unstable. In 1960, Soviet researchers introduced a new &quot;minimum-B&quot; configuration to address this, which was then modified by UK researchers into the &quot;baseball coil&quot; and by the US to &quot;yin-yang magnet&quot; layout. Each of these introductions led to further increases in performance, damping out various instabilities, but requiring ever-larger magnet systems. The tandem mirror concept, developed in the US and Russia at about the same time, offered a way to make energy-positive machines without requiring enormous magnets and power input.

By the late 1970s, many of the design problems were considered solved, and Lawrence Livermore Laboratory began the design of the Mirror Fusion Test Facility (MFTF) based on these concepts. The machine was completed in 1986, but by this time, experiments on the smaller Tandem Mirror Experiment revealed new problems. In a round of budget cuts, MFTF was mothballed, and eventually scrapped. A fusion reactor concept called the Bumpy torus made use of a series of magnetic mirrors joined in a ring. It was investigated at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory until 1986. The mirror approach has since seen less development, in favor of the tokamak, but mirror research continues today in countries like Japan and Russia.

== History ==
===Early work===
The concept of magnetic-mirror plasma confinement was proposed in the early-1950s independently by Gersh Budker at the Kurchatov Institute, Russia and Richard F. Post at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US.

With the formation of Project Sherwood in 1951, Post began the development of a small device to test the mirror configuration. This consisted of a linear pyrex tube with magnets around the outside. The magnets were arranged in two sets, one set of small magnets spaced evenly along the length of the tube, and another pair of much larger magnets at either end. In 1952 they were able to demonstrate that plasma within the tube was confined for much longer times when the mirror magnets at the end were turned on. At the time, he referred to this device as the &quot;pyrotron&quot;, but this name did not catch on.

===Instabilities===
In a now-famous talk on fusion in 1954, Edward Teller noted that any device with convex magnetic field lines would likely be unstable, a problem today known as the flute instability. The mirror has precisely such a configuration; the magnetic field was highly convex at the ends where the field strength increased. This led to serious concern by Post, but over the next year, his team could find no sign of these problems. In October 1955 he went so far as to state that &quot;it is now becoming clear that in the case of the mirror machine at least these calculations do not apply in detail.&quot;

In Russia, the first small-scale mirror (&quot;probkotron&quot;) was built in 1959 at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Novosibirsk, Russia. They immediately saw the problem Teller had warned about. This led to something of a mystery, as the US teams under Post continued to lack any evidence of such problems. In 1960, Post and Marshall Rosenbluth published a report &quot;providing evidence for the existence of a stability confined plasma... where the simplest hydromagnetic theory predicts instability.&quot;

At a meeting on plasma physics in Saltzberg in 1961, the Soviet delegation presented considerable data showing the instability, while the US teams continued to show none. An offhand question by Lev Artsimovich settled the matter; when he asked if the charts being produced from the instruments in the US machines were adjusted for a well-known delay in the output of the detectors being used, it suddenly became clear that the apparent 1 ms stability was, in fact, a 1 ms delay in the measurements. Artsimovich went so far as to claim &quot;we now do not have a single experimental fact indicating long and stable confinement of plasma with hot ions within a simple magnetic mirror geometry.&quot;

===New geometries===
The issue of the potential instabilities had been considered in the field for some time and a number of possible solutions had been introduced. These generally worked by changing the shape of the magnetic field so it was concave everywhere, the so-called &quot;minimum-B&quot; configuration.

At the same 1961 meeting, Mikhail Ioffe introduced data from a minimum-B experiment. His design used a series of six additional current-carrying bars in the interior of an otherwise typical mirror to bend the plasma into the shape of a twisted bow-tie to produce a minimum-B configuration. They demonstrated that this greatly improved the confinement times to the order of milliseconds. Today this arrangement is known as &quot;Ioffe bars&quot;.

A group at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy noted that Ioffe&#x27;s arrangement could be improved by combining the original rings and the bars into a single new arrangement similar to the seam on a tennis ball. This concept was picked up in the US where it was renamed after the stitching on a baseball. These &quot;baseball coils&quot; had the great advantage that they left the internal volume of the reactor open, allowing easy access for diagnostic instruments. On the downside, the size of the magnet in comparison to the volume of plasma was inconvenient and required very powerful magnets. Post later introduced a further improvement, the &quot;yin-yang coils&quot;, which used two C-shaped magnets to produce the same field configuration, but in a smaller volume.

In the US, major changes to the fusion program were underway. Robert Hirsch and his assistant Stephen O. Dean were excited by the huge performance advance seen in the Soviet tokamaks, which suggested power production was now a real possibility. Hirsch began to change the program from one he derided as a series of uncoordinated science experiments into a planned effort to ultimately reach breakeven. As part of this change, he began to demand that the current systems demonstrate real progress or they would be cancelled. The bumpy torus, levitron and Astron were all abandoned, not without a fight.

Dean met with Livermore&#x27;s team and made it clear that Astron would likely be cut, and mirrors had to improve or face cutting as well, which would have left the lab with no major fusion projects. In December 1972, Dean met with the mirror team and made a series of demands; their systems would have to demonstrate an nT value of 1012, compared to the current best number on 2XII of 8x109. After considerable concern from the researchers that this would be impossible, Dean backed off to 1011 being demonstrated by the end of 1975.

===DCLC===
Although 2XII was nowhere near the level needed by Dean&#x27;s demands, it was nevertheless extremely successful in demonstrating that the yin-yang arrangement was workable and suppressed the major instabilities seen in earlier mirrors. But as experiments continued through 1973, the results were not improving as expected. Plans emerged to brute-force the performance through the addition of neutral-beam injection to quickly raise the temperature to reach Dean&#x27;s conditions. The result was 2XIIB, the B for &quot;beams&quot;.

While 2XIIB was being set up, in November 1974, Fowler received a letter from Ioffe containing a series of photographs of oscilloscope traces with no other explanation. Fowler realized they demonstrated that injecting warm plasma during the run improved confinement. This appeared to be due to a long-expected but so-far unseen instability known as &quot;drift-cyclotron loss-cone&quot;, or DCLC. Ioffe&#x27;s photographs demonstrated that DCLC was being seen in Soviet reactors and that warm plasma appeared to stabilize it.

2XIIB reactor started real experiments in 1975, and significant DCLC was immediately seen. Annoyingly, the effect grew stronger as they improved the operating conditions with better vacuum and cleaning of the interior. Fowler recognized the performance was identical to that of Ioffe&#x27;s photographs, and 2XIIB was modified to inject warm plasma during the center of the run. When the results were seen, they were described as &quot;sunlight was breaking through the clouds and there was the chance that everything would be all right.&quot;

===Q-enhancement and tandem mirrors===
In July 1975, the 2XIIB team presented their results for nT at 7x1010, an order of magnitude better than 2XII and close enough to Dean&#x27;s requirements. By this time, the Princeton Large Torus had come online and was setting record after record, prompting Hirsch to begin planning for even larger machines for the early 1980s with the explicit goal of hitting breakeven, or &quot;Q&quot;=1. This became known as the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR), whose goal was to run on deuterium-tritium fuel and reach &quot;Q&quot;=1, while future machines would be &quot;Q&quot;&gt;10.

With the latest results on 2XIIB, it appeared that a larger yin-yang design would also improve performance. However, calculations showed it would only reach &quot;Q&quot;=0.03. Even the most developed versions of the basic concept, with leakage at the absolute lower limit allowed by theory, could only reach &quot;Q&quot;=1.2. This made these designs largely useless for power production, and Hirsch demanded that this be improved if the program were to continue. This problem became known as &quot;Q-enhancement&quot;.

In March 1976, the Livermore team decided to organize a working group on the topic of Q-enhancement at the October 1976 international fusion meeting in Germany. Over the July 4th weekend, Fowler and Post came up with the idea of the tandem mirror, a system consisting of two mirrors at either end of a large chamber that held large amounts fusion fuel at lower magnetic pressure. They returned to LLNL on Monday to find the idea had been developed independently by a staff physicist, Grant Logan. They brought further developed versions of these ideas to Germany to find a Soviet researcher proposing exactly the same solution.

Upon their return from the meeting, Dean met with the team and decided to shut down the Baseball II system and direct its funding to a tandem mirror project. This emerged as the Tandem Mirror Experiment, or TMX. The final design was presented and approved in January 1977. Construction of what was then the largest experiment at Livermore was completed by October 1978. By July 1979, experiments were demonstrating that TMX was operating as expected.

===Thermal barriers and MFTF===
Even before the tandem mirror concept emerged, what was by this time the Department of Energy had agreed to fund the construction of a much larger mirror known as the Mirror Fusion Test Facility (MFTF). At the time, the plan for MFTF was to simply be the largest yin-yang magnet anyone could figure out how to build. With the success of the TMX concept, the design was modified to become MFTF-B, using two of the largest yin-yang magnets anyone could figure out how to build in an enormous tandem configuration. The goal was to meet &quot;Q&quot;=5. Through late 1978 when the teams began to actually consider the steps in scaling up the TMX, it became clear that it simply would not hit the required goals. In January 1979, Fowler stopped the work, stating that some improvement would have to be found.

During experiments on the TMX, it was found to everyone&#x27;s surprise that the law introduced by Lyman Spitzer in the 1950s was not holding; in TMX at least, electrons on any single magnetic line were found to be in a wide variety of speeds, which was entirely unexpected. Further work by John Clauser demonstrated that this was due to the warm plasma injection used to suppress DCLC. Logan took these results and used them to come up with an entirely new way to confine the plasma; with the careful arrangement of these electrons, one could produce a region with a large number of &quot;cool&quot; electrons that would attract the positively charged ions. Dave Baldwin then demonstrated this could be enhanced through the neutral beams. Fowler referred to the result as a &quot;thermal barrier&quot;, as the hotter fuel was repelled from these regions. It appeared it could maintain confinement using much less energy than the pure TMX concept.

This result suggested that MFTF would not just meet an arbitrary &quot;Q&quot;=5, but make it a real competitor to the tokamaks, which were promising much higher &quot;Q&quot; values. Fowler began the design of another version of MFTF, still called MFTF-B, based on the thermal barrier concept. the lab decided they should begin construction, lacking any experimental evidence that the concept worked, in order to get a competitive machine out around the same time as TFTR. While this huge machine was being built, TMX would be modified to test the concept.

On 28 January 1980, Fowler and his team presented their results to the DOE. Demonstrating that TMX had worked, and armed with additional data from the Soviets as well as computer simulations, they presented a plan to begin construction on a $226 million MFTF while upgrading TMX to add the thermal barriers in the $14 million TMX-U. The proposal was accepted and construction on both systems began, with TMX shutting down in September 1980 for conversion.

===TMX-U fails, MFTF mothballed===

TMX-U began experiments in July 1982, by which time parts of Boeing 747-sized MFTF were being installed at Building 431. However, as they attempted to raise the density of the plasma to values that would be needed for MFTF, they found that plasma escaping from the central tank overwhelmed the thermal barriers. There was no obvious reason to believe the same would not occur on the MFTF. If the rates seen in TMX-U were typical, there was no way MFTF would come remotely close to its &quot;Q&quot; goals.

Construction on MFTF, already budgeted, continued and the system was declared officially complete on 21 February 1986, at a final price of $372 million. While thanking the team for their contributions in building the system, the new director of the DOE, John Clarke, also announced that there would be no funding to run it. Clarke later lamented that the decision to cancel the project was very difficult, &quot;It would have been so much easier if I had a technical failure to point to.&quot;

It sat unused for a year on the chance that operational funding would be provided. It never was. The machine was scrapped in 1987. The DOE also cut funding for most other mirror programs.

===1986-===

Magnetic mirror research continued in Russia. One example is the Gas Dynamic Trap, an experimental fusion machine used at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Akademgorodok (Academic Town) in Novosibirsk (New Siberia), Russia. This machine achieved a 0.6 beta ratio for 5⨉10−3 seconds, at a low temperature of 1 keV. Technical challenges included maintaining the non-Maxwellian velocity distribution. This meant that instead of many high energy ions hitting one another, the ion energy diffused into a bell curve. The ions then thermalized, leaving most of the material too cold to fuse. Collisions scattered the charged particles so much that they could not be contained. Lastly, velocity space instabilities contributed to the escape of the plasma.

In September 2022, University of Wisconsin–Madison researchers incorporated a spin-off startup company named &quot;Realta Fusion&quot; to develop and commercialize tandem mirror reactors to supply industrial process heat with smaller power plants. Their stated goal is a &quot;lowest capital, least complex path&quot; to fusion energy. In May 2023, United States Department of Energy granted the company additional funding.

Magnetic mirrors play an important role in other types of magnetic fusion energy devices such as tokamaks, where the toroidal magnetic field is stronger on the inboard side than on the outboard side. The resulting effects are &quot;neoclassical&quot;. Magnetic mirrors also occur in nature. Electrons and ions in the magnetosphere, for example, will bounce back and forth between the stronger fields at the poles, leading to the Van Allen radiation belts.

Centrifugal magnetic mirrors use supersonic rotation to stabilize the mirrors, which helps heat plasma to fusion temperatures.

could enable commercial nuclear fusion reactors on Earth and are promising for space propulsion. One concept could achieve 1 to 10 newtons of thrust with 10,000 to 30000 specific impulse, some 30-100x more fuel efficient than chemical propulsion, dramatically decreasing journey times.

== Mathematical derivation ==
The mirror effect can be shown mathematically. Assume adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment, i.e. that the particle&#x27;s magnetic moment and total energy do not change. Adiabatic invariance is lost when a particle occupies a null point or zone of no magnetic field. The magnetic moment can be expressed as:
formula_1

It is assumed that μ will remain constant while the particle moves into the denser magnetic field. Mathematically, for this to happen the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field formula_2 must also rise. Meanwhile the total energy of the particle formula_3 can be expressed as:
formula_4

In regions with no electric field, if the total energy remains constant then the velocity parallel to the magnetic field must drop. If it can go negative then there is a motion repelling the particle from the dense fields.

=== Mirror ratios ===
Magnetic mirrors themselves have a mirror ratio this is expressed mathematically as:
formula_5

At the same time, particles within the mirror have a pitch angle. This is the angle between the particles&#x27; velocity vector and the magnetic field vector. Surprisingly, the particles with the small pitch angle can escape the mirror. These particles are said to be in the loss cone. The reflected particles meet the following criteria:
formula_6

Where formula_7 is the particle velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field and formula_8 is particle velocity parallel to the magnetic field.

This result was surprising because it was expected that heavier and faster particles, or those with less electric charge, would be harder to reflect. It was also expected that a smaller magnetic field would reflect fewer particles. However, the gyroradius in those circumstances is also larger, so that the radial component of the magnetic field seen by the particle is also larger. It is true that the minimum volume and magnetic energy is larger for the case of fast particles and weak fields, but the mirror ratio required remains the same.

==Adiabatic invariance==
The properties of magnetic mirrors can be derived using the adiabatic invariance of magnetic flux under changes in magnetic field strength. As the field gets stronger, the velocity increases proportionally to the square root of B, and the kinetic energy is proportional to B. This can be thought of as an effective potential binding the particle.

== Magnetic bottles ==
A magnetic bottle is two magnetic mirrors placed close together. For example, two parallel coils separated by a small distance, carrying the same current in the same direction will produce a magnetic bottle between them. Unlike the full mirror machine which typically had many large rings of current surrounding the middle of the magnetic field, the bottle typically has just two rings of current. Particles near either end of the bottle experience a magnetic force towards the center of the region; particles with appropriate speeds spiral repeatedly from one end of the region to the other and back. Magnetic bottles can be used to temporarily trap charged particles. It is easier to trap electrons than ions, because electrons are so much lighter. This technique is used to confine the high energy of plasma in fusion experiments.

In a similar way, the Earth&#x27;s non-uniform magnetic field traps charged particles coming from the Sun in doughnut shaped regions around the Earth called the &quot;Van Allen radiation belts&quot;, which were discovered in 1958 using data obtained by instruments aboard the Explorer 1 satellite.

== Biconic cusps ==

If one of the poles in the magnetic bottle is reversed, it becomes a biconic cusp, which can also hold charged particles. Biconic cusps were first studied by Harold Grad at the Courant Institute, studies reveal the presence of different types of particles inside a biconic cusp. The most financed cusp approach is the Compact Fusion Reactor which was supported by Lockheed-Martin starting in 2007.

<doc id="40236" wikidata="Q40061" url="?curid=40236" title="Emma of Normandy">
<text>Emma of Normandy (referred to as Ælfgifu in royal documents; – 6 March 1052) was a Norman-born noblewoman who became the English, Danish, and Norwegian queen through her marriages to the Anglo-Saxon king Æthelred the Unready and the Danish king Cnut the Great. A daughter of the Norman ruler Richard the Fearless and Gunnor, she was Queen of England during her marriage to King Æthelred from 1002 to 1016, except during a brief interruption in 1013–14 when the Danish king Sweyn Forkbeard occupied the English throne. Æthelred died in 1016, and Emma married Sweyn&#x27;s son Cnut. As Cnut&#x27;s wife, she was Queen of England from their marriage in 1017, Queen of Denmark from 1018, and Queen of Norway from 1028 until Cnut died in 1035.

After Cnut&#x27;s death, Emma continued to participate in politics during the reigns of her sons by each husband, Harthacnut and Edward the Confessor. In 1035 when her second husband Cnut died and was succeeded by their son Harthacnut, who was in Denmark at the time, Emma was designated to act as his regent until his return, which she did in rivalry with Harold Harefoot. Emma is the central figure within the &quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot;, a critical source for the history of early-11th-century English politics. As Catherine Karkov notes, Emma is one of the most visually represented early medieval queens.

== Marriage to Æthelred II ==
In an attempt to pacify Normandy, King Æthelred of England married Emma in 1002. Similarly Richard II, Duke of Normandy, Emma&#x27;s brother, hoped to improve relations with the English in the wake of recent conflict and a failed kidnapping attempt against him by Æthelred. Viking raids on England were often based in Normandy in the late 10th century, and for Æthelred this marriage was intended to unite against the Viking threat. Upon their marriage, Emma was given the Anglo-Saxon name of Ælfgifu, which was used for formal and official matters, and became Queen of England. She received properties of her own in Winchester, Rutland, Devonshire, Suffolk and Oxfordshire, as well as the city of Exeter.

Æthelred and Emma had two sons, Edward the Confessor and Alfred Ætheling, and a daughter, Goda of England (or Godgifu).

When King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark invaded and conquered England in 1013, Emma and her children were sent to Normandy, where Æthelred soon joined them. They returned to England after Sweyn died in 1014.

Emma and Æthelred&#x27;s marriage ended with Æthelred&#x27;s death in London in 1016. Æthelred&#x27;s oldest son from his first marriage, Æthelstan Ætheling, had been heir apparent until his death in June 1014. Emma&#x27;s sons had been ranked after all of the sons from Æthelred&#x27;s first wife, the eldest surviving of whom was Edmund Ironside. Emma attempted to get her older son, Edward, recognized as heir. Although this movement was supported by Æthelred&#x27;s chief advisor, Eadric Streona, it was opposed by Edmund Ironside, Æthelred&#x27;s third-oldest son, and his allies, who eventually revolted against his father.

In 1015 Cnut the Great, the son of Sweyn Forkbeard, invaded England. He was held out of London until the deaths in 1016 of Æthelred (April) and Edmund (November). Queen Emma attempted to maintain Anglo-Saxon control of London until her marriage to Cnut was arranged. Some scholars believe that the marriage saved her sons&#x27; lives, as Cnut tried to rid himself of rival claimants, but spared their lives.

== Marriage to Cnut ==

Cnut gained control of most of England after he defeated Edmund Ironside on 18 October 1016, at the Battle of Assandun, after which they agreed to divide the kingdom, Edmund taking Wessex and Cnut the rest of the country. Edmund died shortly afterwards on 30 November, and Cnut became the king of all England. At the time of their marriage in 1017, Emma&#x27;s sons from her marriage to Æthelred were sent to live in Normandy under the tutelage of her brother. At this time Emma became Queen of England, and later of Denmark and Norway.

The &quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot; suggests in its second book that Emma and Cnut&#x27;s marriage, though begun as a political strategy, became an affectionate marriage.
During their marriage, Emma and Cnut had a son, Harthacnut, and a daughter, Gunhilda.

==Children==
During her two marriages Emma had 5 children:
* Edward the Confessor c. 1003 – 5 January 1066, died without issue
* Goda of England c.1004 – c.1049
* Alfred the Noble c. 1005–1036
* Harthacnut
* Gunhilda of Denmark

==Conspiracy regarding the death of Alfred==

In 1036, Alfred Aetheling and Edward the Confessor, Emma&#x27;s sons by Æthelred, returned to England from their exile in Normandy in order to visit their mother. During their time in England they were supposed to be protected by Harthacnut. However, Harthacnut was involved with his kingdom in Denmark. Alfred was captured and blinded by holding a hot iron poker to his eyes. He later died from his wounds.

Edward escaped the attack, and returned to Normandy. He returned after his place on the throne had been secured.

&quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot; places the blame of Alfred&#x27;s capture, torture and murder completely on Harold Harefoot, thinking he intended to rid himself of two more potential claimants to the English throne by killing Edward and Alfred. Some scholars make the argument that it could have been Godwin, Earl of Wessex, who was travelling with Alfred and Edward as their protector in passage.

==Harthacnut&#x27;s reign==
Harthacnut, Emma and Cnut&#x27;s son, assembled a fleet to invade England in 1039, and when Harold died in March 1040 he was invited to become king. He crossed to England with his fleet and Emma. He was criticised by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for his heavy taxation to pay for the fleet and for having Harold&#x27;s body disinterred and thrown into a ditch. In 1041 he invited his half-brother Edward the Confessor to England. The &quot;Encomium&quot; says that Edward was sworn in as king, which probably means that he was recognised as heir as Harthacnut knew that he did not have long to live. He may have been persuaded to make the invitation by Emma, who would have been keen to preserve her position by ensuring that England was still ruled by a son of hers.

==Edward&#x27;s reign==

After Harthacnut&#x27;s death in June 1042, Edward the Confessor succeeded to the throne and was crowned in April 1043. During the same year, Edward rode to Winchester along with Earls Leofric, Godwin, and Siward, accused Emma of treason, and deprived her of her lands and titles. However, Edward soon relented, and Emma&#x27;s lands and titles were restored.
== Death and burial ==

After her death in 1052, Emma was interred alongside Cnut and Harthacnut in the Old Minster, Winchester, before being transferred to the new cathedral built after the Norman Conquest. During the English Civil War (1642–1651), their remains were disinterred and scattered about the Cathedral floor by parliamentary forces. The jumbled bones were later re-interred.

==Queenship==
As Pauline Stafford noted, Emma is the &quot;first of the early medieval queens&quot; to be depicted through contemporary portraiture. To that end, Emma is the central figure within the &quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot; (incorrectly titled &quot;Gesta Cnutonis Regis&quot; during the later Middle Ages) a critical source for the study of English succession in the 11th century. During the reign of Æthelred, Emma most likely served as little more than a figurehead a physical embodiment of the treaty between the English and her Norman father. However, her influence increased considerably under Cnut. Until 1043, writes Stafford, Emma &quot;was the richest woman in England ... and held extensive lands in the East Midlands and Wessex.&quot; Emma&#x27;s authority was not simply tied to landholdings—which fluctuated greatly from 1036 to 1043—she also wielded significant sway over the ecclesiastical offices of England.

==The &quot;Encomium Emmæ Reginae&quot; or &quot;Gesta Cnutonis Regis&quot;==

The &quot;Encomium&quot; is divided into three parts, the first of which deals with Sweyn Forkbeard and his conquest of England. The second focuses on Cnut and relates the defeat of &quot;Princes&quot; Æthelred (never named) and Edmund, Cnut&#x27;s marriage to Emma (again, without mentioning she had been the wife of Æthelred), and Cnut&#x27;s kingship. The third addresses the events after Cnut&#x27;s death; Emma&#x27;s involvement in the seizing of the royal treasury, and the treachery of Earl Godwin. It begins by addressing Emma, &quot;May our Lord Jesus Christ preserve you, O Queen, who excel all those of your sex in the amiability of your way of life.&quot; Emma is &quot;the most distinguished woman of her time for delightful beauty and wisdom.&quot;

===Scholarly debate===
This flattery, writes Elizabeth M. Tyler, is &quot;part of a deliberate attempt to intervene, on Emma&#x27;s behalf, in the politics of the Anglo-Danish court,&quot; a connotation which an 11th-century audience would have understood. This proves to be a direct contrast to earlier evaluations of the text, such as the introduction to the 1998 reprint of Alistair Campbell&#x27;s 1949 edition in which Simon Keynes remarks: 

Felice Lifshitz, in her seminal study of the &quot;Encomium&quot; comments:
===Manuscripts===
Prior to May 2008 only one copy of the &quot;Encomium&quot; was believed to exist. However, a late-14th-century manuscript, the Courtenay Compendium, was discovered in the Devon Record Office, where it had languished since the 1960s. According to a report by the UK Arts Council, &quot;The most significant item [within the text] for British history is the Encomium Emma Reginae ... It is highly probable that the present manuscript represents the most complete witness to the revised version of the Encomium&quot;. The manuscript was put up for auction in December 2008, and purchased for £600,000 (5.2 million Danish kroner) on behalf of the Royal Library, Denmark. Unlike the &quot;Liber Vitae,&quot; the compendium does not contain any images of Emma.
The New Minster &quot;Liber Vitae, now in the British Library, was completed in 1030, shortly before Cnut&#x27;s death in 1035. The frontispiece depicts &quot;King Cnut and Queen Emma presenting a cross to the altar of New Minster, Winchester.&quot; Stafford in her visual exegesis of the portrait states, &quot;it is not clear whether we should read it as a representation of a powerful woman or a powerless one.&quot; In one portrait, each facet of Emma&#x27;s role as sovereign is displayed; that of a dutiful wife and influential queen.

It has been suggested that the poem &quot;Semiramis&quot;, possibly written in 1017 by Warner of Rouen at the court of Emma&#x27;s brother, Richard, Duke of Normandy, and dedicated to her brother, Archbishop Robert, is a contemporary satire ridiculing Emma&#x27;s relation with Cnut.

Emma is also depicted in a number of later medieval texts, such as the 13th-century &quot;Life of Edward the Confessor&quot; (Cambridge University Library MS. Ee.3.59) and a 14th-century roll, &quot;Genealogy of the English Kings, Genealogical Chronicle of the English Kings&quot;.

Emma and her sons Edward and Alfred are characters in the anonymous Elizabethan play &quot;Edmund Ironside&quot;, sometimes considered an early work by William Shakespeare.

==The Ordeal of Queen Emma==
 The Ordeal of Queen Emma by Fire at Winchester is a legend that seems to have originated in the 13th century. Queen Emma was accused of unchastity with Bishop Ælfwine of Winchester. In order to prove her innocence, she was obliged to undergo the ordeal of walking over nine red-hot ploughshares placed on the pavement of the nave of Winchester Cathedral. Two bishops conducted the barefoot queen to the line of red-hot ploughshares. She walked over the red-hot ploughshares, but, having sought the protection of St Swithun, whose shrine is at Winchester, felt neither the naked iron nor the fire. William Blake did an illustration of the event.

<text>George Herbert Putnam (September 20, 1861 – August 14, 1955) was an American librarian. He was the eighth (and also the longest-serving) Librarian of Congress from 1899 to 1939. He implemented his vision of a universal collection with strengths in many languages, especially from Europe and Latin America.

==Biography==
George Herbert Putnam was born in New York City at 107 East Seventeenth Street, the sixth son and tenth child of Victorine and George Palmer Putnam. The father, one-time collector of internal revenue in New York by appointment of Abraham Lincoln, was the founder of a well-known publishing house, known previously as the Putnam Publishing house, but now known as G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons.

In 1886, Herbert Putnam married Charlotte Elizabeth Munroe of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and together they had two daughters, Shirley and Brenda Putnam. Brenda Putnam grew up to become a celebrated sculptor in the early 20th century, highly known for her &quot;children, cherubs, and garden ornaments.&quot; Throughout Herbert Putnam&#x27;s career, he was described by his colleagues as maintaining &quot;an impenetrable dignity…formal manner, invariable gracious and cordial, covered shyness and a deep reserve. He had few intimates, even among his closest colleagues, but he was fond of good company and good conversation&quot; as well being &quot;painfully modest, a family man who had an unreciprocated view of his staff as family.&quot;

He died at his home in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, on August 14, 1955.

==Early career==
After graduating magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1883, Putnam spent the following year at Columbia University Law School. Eventually, however, his interest in administrative work led him to the Minneapolis Athenaeum where he served as librarian in 1887, until it merged into the Minneapolis Public Library in 1888. Putnam was elected city librarian of the Minneapolis Public Library at that time and served while simultaneously being admitted to the Minnesota bar of Law. According to the Honorable Lawrence Lewis of Colorado at a Tribute for Putnam in 1939, Putnam at this time &quot;modernized antiquated methods, revised the charging records of books on loan, inaugurated a new system of cataloging and classification, opened the alcoves to readers, [and] insisted that &#x27;there are two great problems of library management – one to get the books for the readers, the other to get the readers to the books.&#x27;&quot; During this time he developed the Putnam Classification System (based in part on work by John Edmands), which would influence his later design of the Library of Congress Classification system.

In 1891, Putnam resigned his Minneapolis post due to his mother-in-law&#x27;s ill health and promptly returned to Boston to be near her. Putnam &quot;was admitted to the Suffolk bar, and practiced law in Boston until the 18th of February 1895&quot; when he was appointed Librarian of the Boston Public Library. During his tenure at the Boston Public Library &quot;there were 9 branches and 12 delivery stations. At the end of his four years, there were 10 branches, 5 minor branches, called &#x27;reading rooms,&#x27; and 56 deposit stations…the library grew from a total of 610,375 volumes at the close of 1894 to 716,050 at the close of 1898.&quot; Another contribution made by Putnam towards the Boston Public Library was the addition of a room devoted to juveniles, &quot;believed to have been the first room wholly devoted to the service of children in any of the larger libraries of the country.&quot;

==Library of Congress==

===Induction===
As the ALA&#x27;s leading witness during the 1896 Congressional Joint Committee on the Library, Putnam was able to successfully lobby Congress to greatly expand the role of the Library of Congress. This restructuring and expansion of the Library became effective on July 1, 1897. Putnam&#x27;s activities with the American Library Association led him to join with Justin Winsor and Melvil Dewey as official delegates to the International Conference of Librarians in London in 1897. When Winsor died shortly thereafter, Putnam served the remainder of his term as President of the ALA. When John Russell Young died in January 1899, President William McKinley requested Congress to appoint Putnam. He was officially confirmed December 12, 1899.

===Systemization of a public institution===

Upon the confirmation of Putnam to his appointed duty of Librarian of Congress, one daunting task Putnam faced from the onset was the sheer volume of materials that had to be reorganized for the newly opened Thomas Jefferson Building – the newly appointed library for the Library of Congress. However, Putnam was well aware of what needed to be done. &quot;In October 1899 Putnam requested a $190,000 increase in the budget for fiscal 1901. If Congress consented, the 1899 LC budget would nearly double and that for 1900 would be increased by 60 percent. Declaring that the collections were deficient in many respects, [Putnam] asked for $50,000 to purchase new material, more than twice the 1899 appropriation. In summation, the first task of Putnam&#x27;s administration was to organize all materials of the Library of Congress so they may be used efficiently by the public.&quot;

Putnam&#x27;s request was granted by the United States Congress, and thus an appropriation bill was passed on April 17, 1900. Although Putnam&#x27;s administration would need time in order to collect, organize, and disseminate all of the material within the Library of Congress&#x27; collection, the task was completed with enormous success. &quot;By 1924 the first objective had been won with – 
1) All spaces in the building duly differentiated and equipped for specialized, as well as general, uses. 
2) The specialized material installed in appropriate cases. 
3) A scheme of classification, systematic and elastic, with an appropriate nomenclature. 
4) Adoption of processes of cataloging, including forms of entry, now standardized for American libraries. 
5) Actual application of the classification and cataloging to a large portion of the collection of printed books.&quot;

Putnam during this time also introduced a new system of classifying books that continues to this day, known as the Library of Congress Classification. He also established an interlibrary loan system, and expanded the Library of Congress&#x27;s role and relationships with other libraries, through the provision of centralized services. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1902, and elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1907.

===War-time service===

In July 1916, &quot;former LC staff member Elizabeth West, director of the Carnegie Library of San Antonio, Texas, suggested to Putnam that the Library of Congress cooperate with other libraries to send books to American soldiers.&quot;

Initially, Putnam was not interested in the wholesale distribution of books to American troops simply due to the lack of interest. However, when attention arose that the British War Library Service in London were performing similar duties to their troops, measures were quickly devised by Putnam, the ALA, and Congress to enact such a program to the American military branches. &quot;Aided by a grant of $320,000 from the Carnegie Corporation, the War Service built thirty-six libraries, completing the majority by February 1918. But with so much invested in buildings, little money remained for books or administration…Putnam took the matter up directly with the War Department and obtained assurances that the government would provide utilities. He appealed to ALA members to donate books and volunteer for service, and by June 1918 the association had purchased 300,000 books, sent 1,349,000 gift books to camps, and distributed 500,000 magazines.&quot; In the time after World War I, the services of the Library of Congress towards the war effort provided a new outlook for the American public on the possibilities of what a successful library could accomplish. In other words, the contributions made by the Library of Congress in that time gave &quot;librarians &#x27;a new conception of what a truly national library could be&#x27; and added one more item &#x27;to the long list of benefits for which American libraries have to thank the Library and the Librarian, of Congress.&quot;

==Retirement==

Herbert Putnam&#x27;s administration as Librarian of Congress lasted for forty years, from 1899 until 1939. It was clear Putnam was not willing to withdraw completely from the world of librarianship, stating: &quot;I would willingly surrender the administration, if that course would serve the interest of the library and I could feel assured as to my successor.&quot; Putnam provided the suggestion of &quot;Librarian Emeritus&quot; be developed as his new official title, with an honorarium of one-half of his original salary. On October 1, 1939, Putnam retired as the 8th Librarian of Congress with that title, and he &quot;continued to contribute to the Library, keeping regular office hours for the next 15 years.&quot; 

Putnam was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership in 1940.

Herbert Putnam was succeeded in 1939 by Archibald MacLeish, who served from 1939 until 1944.

<text>A geosynchronous orbit (sometimes abbreviated GSO) is an Earth-centered orbit with an orbital period that matches Earth&#x27;s rotation on its axis, 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds (one sidereal day). The synchronization of rotation and orbital period means that, for an observer on Earth&#x27;s surface, an object in geosynchronous orbit returns to exactly the same position in the sky after a period of one sidereal day. Over the course of a day, the object&#x27;s position in the sky may remain still or trace out a path, typically in a figure-8 form, whose precise characteristics depend on the orbit&#x27;s inclination and eccentricity. A circular geosynchronous orbit has a constant altitude of .

A special case of geosynchronous orbit is the geostationary orbit (often abbreviated &quot;GEO&quot;), which is a circular geosynchronous orbit in Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane with both inclination and eccentricity equal to 0. A satellite in a geostationary orbit remains in the same position in the sky to observers on the surface.

Communications satellites are often given geostationary or close-to-geostationary orbits, so that the satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to move but can be pointed permanently at the fixed location in the sky where the satellite appears.

== History ==

In 1929, Herman Potočnik described both geosynchronous orbits in general and the special case of the geostationary Earth orbit in particular as useful orbits for space stations. The first appearance of a geosynchronous orbit in popular literature was in October 1942, in the first Venus Equilateral story by George O. Smith, but Smith did not go into details. British science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke popularised and expanded the concept in a 1945 paper entitled &quot;Extra-Terrestrial Relays – Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?&quot;, published in &quot;Wireless World&quot; magazine. Clarke acknowledged the connection in his introduction to &quot;The Complete Venus Equilateral&quot;. The orbit, which Clarke first described as useful for broadcast and relay communications satellites, is sometimes called the Clarke Orbit. Similarly, the collection of artificial satellites in this orbit is known as the Clarke Belt.

In technical terminology, the geosynchronous orbits are often referred to as geostationary if they are roughly over the equator, but the terms are used somewhat interchangeably. Specifically, geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) may be a synonym for &quot;geosynchronous equatorial orbit&quot;, or &quot;geostationary Earth orbit&quot;.

The first geosynchronous satellite was designed by Harold Rosen while he was working at Hughes Aircraft in 1959. Inspired by Sputnik 1, he wanted to use a geostationary (geosynchronous equatorial) satellite to globalise communications. Telecommunications between the US and Europe was then possible between just 136 people at a time, and reliant on high frequency radios and an undersea cable.

Conventional wisdom at the time was that it would require too much rocket power to place a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit and it would not survive long enough to justify the expense, so early efforts were put towards constellations of satellites in low or medium Earth orbit. The first of these were the passive Echo balloon satellites in 1960, followed by Telstar 1 in 1962. Although these projects had difficulties with signal strength and tracking that could be solved through geosynchronous satellites, the concept was seen as impractical, so Hughes often withheld funds and support.

By 1961, Rosen and his team had produced a cylindrical prototype with a diameter of , height of , weighing ; it was light, and small, enough to be placed into orbit by then-available rocketry, was spin stabilised and used dipole antennas producing a pancake-shaped waveform. In August 1961, they were contracted to begin building the working satellite. They lost Syncom 1 to electronics failure, but Syncom 2 was successfully placed into a geosynchronous orbit in 1963. Although its inclined orbit still required moving antennas, it was able to relay TV transmissions, and allowed for US President John F. Kennedy to phone Nigerian prime minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa from a ship on August 23, 1963.

Today there are hundreds of geosynchronous satellites providing remote sensing, navigation and communications.

Although most populated land locations on the planet now have terrestrial communications facilities (microwave, fiber-optic), which often have latency and bandwidth advantages, and telephone access covering 96% of the population and internet access 90% as of 2018, some rural and remote areas in developed countries are still reliant on satellite communications.

== Types ==

=== Geostationary orbit ===
A geostationary equatorial orbit (GEO) is a circular geosynchronous orbit in the plane of the Earth&#x27;s equator with a radius of approximately (measured from the center of the Earth). A satellite in such an orbit is at an altitude of approximately above mean sea level. It maintains the same position relative to the Earth&#x27;s surface. If one could see a satellite in geostationary orbit, it would appear to hover at the same point in the sky, i.e., not exhibit diurnal motion, while the Sun, Moon, and stars would traverse the skies behind it. Such orbits are useful for telecommunications satellites.

A perfectly stable geostationary orbit is an ideal that can only be approximated. In practice the satellite drifts out of this orbit because of perturbations such as the solar wind, radiation pressure, variations in the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field, and the gravitational effect of the Moon and Sun, and thrusters are used to maintain the orbit in a process known as station-keeping.

Eventually, without the use of thrusters, the orbit will become inclined, oscillating between 0° and 15° every 55 years. At the end of the satellite&#x27;s lifetime, when fuel approaches depletion, satellite operators may decide to omit these expensive manoeuvres to correct inclination and only control eccentricity. This prolongs the life-time of the satellite as it consumes less fuel over time, but the satellite can then only be used by ground antennas capable of following the N-S movement.

Geostationary satellites will also tend to drift around one of two stable longitudes of 75° and 255° without station keeping.

=== Elliptical and inclined geosynchronous orbits ===

Many objects in geosynchronous orbits have eccentric and/or inclined orbits. Eccentricity makes the orbit elliptical and appear to oscillate E-W in the sky from the viewpoint of a ground station, while inclination tilts the orbit compared to the equator and makes it appear to oscillate N-S from a groundstation. These effects combine to form an analemma (figure-8).

Satellites in elliptical/eccentric orbits must be tracked by steerable ground stations.

====Tundra orbit====
The Tundra orbit is an eccentric geosynchronous orbit, which allows the satellite to spend most of its time dwelling over one high latitude location. It sits at an inclination of 63.4°, which is a frozen orbit, which reduces the need for stationkeeping. At least two satellites are needed to provide continuous coverage over an area. It was used by the Sirius XM Satellite Radio to improve signal strength in the northern US and Canada.

====Quasi-zenith orbit====
The Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) is a four-satellite system that operates in a geosynchronous orbit at an inclination of 42° and a 0.075 eccentricity. Each satellite dwells over Japan, allowing signals to reach receivers in urban canyons then passes quickly over Australia.

==Launch==

Geosynchronous satellites are launched to the east into a prograde orbit that matches the rotation rate of the equator. The smallest inclination that a satellite can be launched into is that of the launch site&#x27;s latitude, so launching the satellite from close to the equator limits the amount of inclination change needed later. Additionally, launching from close to the equator allows the speed of the Earth&#x27;s rotation to give the satellite a boost. A launch site should have water or deserts to the east, so any failed rockets do not fall on a populated area.

Most launch vehicles place geosynchronous satellites directly into a geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO), an elliptical orbit with an apogee at GSO height and a low perigee. On-board satellite propulsion is then used to raise the perigee, circularise and reach GSO.

Once in a viable geostationary orbit, spacecraft can change their longitudinal position by adjusting their semi-major axis such that the new period is shorter or longer than a sidereal day, in order to effect an apparent &quot;drift&quot; Eastward or Westward, respectively. Once at the desired longitude, the spacecraft&#x27;s period is restored to geosynchronous.

==Proposed orbits==

===Statite proposal===
A statite is a hypothetical satellite that uses radiation pressure from the Sun against a solar sail to modify its orbit.

It would hold its location over the dark side of the Earth at a latitude of approximately 30 degrees. It would return to the same spot in the sky every 24 hours from an Earth-based viewer&#x27;s perspective, so be functionally similar to a geosynchronous orbit.

===Space elevator===
A further form of geosynchronous orbit is the theoretical space elevator. If a mass orbiting above the geostationary belt is tethered to the earth’s surface, and the mass is accelerated to maintain an orbital period equal to one sidereal day, then since the orbit now requires more downward force than is supplied by gravity alone. The tether will become tensioned by the extra centripetal force required, and this tension force is available to hoist objects up the tether structure.

== Retired satellites ==

Geosynchronous satellites require some station-keeping in order to remain in position, and once they run out of thruster fuel and are no longer useful they are moved into a higher graveyard orbit. It is not feasible to deorbit geosynchronous satellites, for to do so would take far more fuel than would be used by slightly elevating the orbit; and atmospheric drag is negligible, giving GSOs lifetimes of thousands of years.

The retirement process is becoming increasingly regulated and satellites must have a 90% chance of moving over 200 km above the geostationary belt at end of life.

=== Space debris ===

Space debris in geosynchronous orbits typically has a lower collision speed than at LEO since most GSO satellites orbit in the same plane, altitude and speed; however, the presence of satellites in eccentric orbits allows for collisions at up to 4 km/s. Although a collision is comparatively unlikely, GSO satellites have a limited ability to avoid any debris.

Debris less than 10 cm in diameter cannot be seen from the Earth, making it difficult to assess their prevalence.

Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The European Space Agency telecom satellite Olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on August 11, 1993, and eventually moved to a graveyard orbit, and in 2006 the Russian Express-AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable, although its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit. In 2017 both AMC-9 and Telkom-1 broke apart from an unknown cause.

==Properties==
A geosynchronous orbit has the following properties:

* Period: 1436 minutes (one sidereal day)
* Semi-major axis: 42,164 km

===Period===
All geosynchronous orbits have an orbital period equal to exactly one sidereal day. This means that the satellite will return to the same point above the Earth&#x27;s surface every (sidereal) day, regardless of other orbital properties. This orbital period, T, is directly related to the semi-major axis of the orbit through the formula:

: formula_1

where:
: is the length of the orbit&#x27;s semi-major axis
: formula_2 is the standard gravitational parameter of the central body

===Inclination===
A geosynchronous orbit can have any inclination.

Satellites commonly have an inclination of zero, ensuring that the orbit remains over the equator at all times, making it stationary with respect to latitude from the point of view of a ground observer (and in the ECEF reference frame).

Another popular inclinations is 63.4° for a Tundra orbit, which ensures that the orbit&#x27;s argument of perigee does not change over time.

===Ground track===

In the special case of a geostationary orbit, the ground track of a satellite is a single point on the equator. In the general case of a geosynchronous orbit with a non-zero inclination or eccentricity, the ground track is a more or less distorted figure-eight, returning to the same places once per sidereal day.

<text>Edward the Confessor ( 1003 – 5 January 1066) was an Anglo-Saxon English king and saint. Usually considered the last king of the House of Wessex, he ruled from 1042 until his death in 1066.

Edward was the son of Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy. He succeeded Cnut the Great&#x27;s son – and his own half-brother – Harthacnut. He restored the rule of the House of Wessex after the period of Danish rule since Cnut conquered England in 1016. When Edward died in 1066, he was succeeded by his wife&#x27;s brother Harold Godwinson, who was defeated and killed in the same year at the Battle of Hastings by the Normans under William the Conqueror. Edward&#x27;s young great-nephew Edgar Ætheling of the House of Wessex was proclaimed king after the Battle of Hastings, but was never crowned and was peacefully deposed after about eight weeks.

Historians disagree about Edward&#x27;s fairly long 24-year reign. His nickname reflects the traditional image of him as unworldly and pious. Confessor reflects his reputation as a saint who did not suffer martyrdom as opposed to his uncle, King Edward the Martyr. Some portray Edward the Confessor&#x27;s reign as leading to the disintegration of royal power in England and the advance in power of the House of Godwin, because of the infighting that began after his death with no heirs to the throne. Biographers Frank Barlow and Peter Rex, on the other hand, portray Edward as a successful king, one who was energetic, resourceful and sometimes ruthless; they argue that the Norman conquest shortly after his death tarnished his image. However, Richard Mortimer argues that the return of the Godwins from exile in 1052 &quot;meant the effective end of his exercise of power&quot;, citing Edward&#x27;s reduced activity as implying &quot;a withdrawal from affairs&quot;.

About a century after his death, in 1161, Pope Alexander III canonised the king. Edward was one of England&#x27;s national saints until King Edward III adopted Saint George (George of Lydda) as the national patron saint in about 1350. Saint Edward&#x27;s feast day is 13 October and is celebrated by both the Church of England and the Catholic Church.

==Early years and exile==
Edward was the seventh son of Æthelred the Unready, and the first by his second wife, Emma of Normandy. Edward was born between 1003 and 1005 in Islip, Oxfordshire, and is first recorded as a &#x27;witness&#x27; to two charters in 1005. He had one full brother, Alfred, and a sister, Godgifu. In charters he was always listed behind his older half-brothers, showing that he ranked beneath them.

During his childhood, England was the target of Viking raids and invasions under Sweyn Forkbeard and his son, Cnut. Following Sweyn&#x27;s seizure of the throne in 1013, Emma fled to Normandy, followed by Edward and Alfred, and then by Æthelred. Sweyn died in February 1014, and leading Englishmen invited Æthelred back on the condition that he promised to rule &#x27;more justly&#x27; than before. Æthelred agreed, sending Edward back with his ambassadors. Æthelred died in April 1016, and he was succeeded by Edward&#x27;s older half-brother Edmund Ironside, who carried on the fight against Sweyn&#x27;s son, Cnut. According to Scandinavian tradition, Edward fought alongside Edmund; as Edward was at most thirteen years old at the time, the story is disputed. Edmund died in November 1016, and Cnut became undisputed king. Edward then again went into exile with his brother and sister; in 1017 his mother married Cnut. In the same year, Cnut had Edward&#x27;s last surviving elder half-brother, Eadwig, executed.

Edward spent a quarter of a century in exile, probably mainly in Normandy, although there is no evidence of his location until the early 1030s. He probably received support from his sister Godgifu, who married Drogo of Mantes, count of Vexin in about 1024. In the early 1030s, Edward witnessed four charters in Normandy, signing two of them as king of England. According to William of Jumièges, the Norman chronicler, Robert I, Duke of Normandy attempted an invasion of England to place Edward on the throne in about 1034 but it was blown off course to Jersey. He also received support for his claim to the throne from several continental abbots, particularly Robert, abbot of the Norman abbey of Jumièges, who later became Edward&#x27;s Archbishop of Canterbury. Edward was said to have developed an intense personal piety during this period, but modern historians regard this as a product of the later medieval campaign for his canonisation. In Frank Barlow&#x27;s view &quot;in his lifestyle would seem to have been that of a typical member of the rustic nobility&quot;. He appeared to have a slim prospect of acceding to the English throne during this period, and his ambitious mother was more interested in supporting Harthacnut, her son by Cnut.

Cnut died in 1035, and Harthacnut succeeded him as king of Denmark. It is unclear whether he intended to keep England as well, but he was defending his position in Denmark and thus was unable to come to England to assert his claim to the throne. It was therefore decided that his elder half-brother Harold Harefoot should act as regent, while Emma held Wessex on Harthacnut&#x27;s behalf. In 1036, Edward and his brother Alfred separately came to England. Emma later claimed that they came in response to a letter forged by Harold inviting them to visit her, but historians believe that she probably did invite them in an effort to counter Harold&#x27;s growing popularity. Alfred was captured by Godwin, Earl of Wessex, who turned him over to Harold Harefoot. He had Alfred blinded by forcing red-hot pokers into his eyes to make him unsuitable for kingship, and Alfred died soon after as a result of his wounds. The murder is thought to be the source of much of Edward&#x27;s hatred for Godwin and one of the primary reasons for Godwin&#x27;s banishment in autumn 1051. Edward is said to have fought a successful skirmish near Southampton, and then retreated back to Normandy. He thus showed his prudence, but he had some reputation as a soldier in Normandy and Scandinavia.

In 1037, Harold was accepted as king, and the following year he expelled Emma, who retreated to Bruges. She then summoned Edward and demanded his help for Harthacnut, but he refused as he had no resources to launch an invasion, and disclaimed any interest for himself in the throne. Harthacnut, his position in Denmark now secure, planned an invasion, but Harold died in 1040, and Harthacnut was able to cross unopposed, with his mother, to take the English throne.

In 1041, Harthacnut invited Edward back to England, probably as his heir because he knew he had not long to live. The 12th-century &quot;Quadripartitus&quot; states that he was recalled by the intervention of Bishop Ælfwine of Winchester and Earl Godwin. Edward met &quot;the thegns of all England&quot; at Hursteshever, likely near modern-day Hurst Spit opposite the Isle of Wight. There, Edward was received as king in return for his oath that he would continue the laws of Cnut. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Edward was sworn in as king alongside Harthacnut, but a diploma issued by Harthacnut in 1042 describes him as the king&#x27;s brother.

==Early reign==

Following Harthacnut&#x27;s death on 8 June 1042, Godwin, the most powerful of the English earls, supported Edward, who succeeded to the throne. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; describes the popularity he enjoyed at his accession – &quot;before he [Harthacnut] was buried, all the people chose Edward as king in London.&quot; Edward was crowned at the cathedral of Winchester, the royal seat of the West Saxons, on Easter Sunday, 3 April 1043.

Edward complained that his mother had &quot;done less for him than he wanted before he became king, and also afterwards&quot;. In November 1043, he rode to Winchester with his three leading earls, Leofric of Mercia, Godwin, and Siward of Northumbria, to deprive her of her property, possibly because she was holding on to treasure which belonged to the king. Her adviser, Stigand, was deprived of his bishopric of Elmham in East Anglia. However, both were soon restored to favour. Emma died in 1052.

Edward&#x27;s position when he came to the throne was weak. Effective rule required keeping on terms with the three leading earls, but loyalty to the ancient house of Wessex had been eroded by the period of Danish rule, and only Leofric was descended from a family which had served Æthelred. Siward was probably Danish, and although Godwin was English, he was one of Cnut&#x27;s new men, married to Cnut&#x27;s former sister-in-law. However, in his early years, Edward restored the traditional strong monarchy, showing himself, in Frank Barlow&#x27;s view, &quot;a vigorous and ambitious man, a true son of the impetuous Æthelred and the formidable Emma.&quot;

In 1043, Godwin&#x27;s eldest son Sweyn was appointed to an earldom in the south-west midlands, and on 23 January 1045 Edward married Godwin&#x27;s daughter Edith. Soon afterwards, her brother Harold and her Danish cousin Beorn Estrithson were also given earldoms in southern England. Godwin and his family now ruled subordinately all of Southern England. However, in 1047 Sweyn was banished for abducting the abbess of Leominster. In 1049, he returned to try to regain his earldom, but this was said to have been opposed by Harold and Beorn, probably because they had been given Sweyn&#x27;s land in his absence. Sweyn murdered his cousin Beorn and went again into exile. Edward&#x27;s nephew Ralph was given Beorn&#x27;s earldom, but the following year Sweyn&#x27;s father was able to secure his reinstatement.

The wealth of Edward&#x27;s lands exceeded that of the greatest earls, but they were scattered among the southern earldoms. He had no personal power base, and it seems he did not attempt to build one. In 1050–51 he even paid off the fourteen foreign ships which constituted his standing navy and abolished the tax raised to pay for it. However, in ecclesiastical and foreign affairs he was able to follow his own policy. King Magnus I of Norway aspired to the English throne, and in 1045 and 1046, fearing an invasion, Edward took command of the fleet at Sandwich. Beorn&#x27;s elder brother, Sweyn II of Denmark &quot;submitted himself to Edward as a son&quot;, hoping for his help in his battle with Magnus for control of Denmark, but in 1047 Edward rejected Godwin&#x27;s demand that he send aid to Sweyn, and it was only Magnus&#x27;s death in October that saved England from attack and allowed Sweyn to take the Danish throne.

Modern historians reject the traditional view that Edward mainly employed Norman favourites, but he did have foreigners in his household, including a few Normans, who became unpopular. Chief among them was Robert, abbot of the Norman abbey of Jumièges, who had known Edward from the 1030s and came to England with him in 1041, becoming bishop of London in 1043. According to the &quot;Vita Edwardi&quot;, he became &quot;always the most powerful confidential adviser to the king&quot;.

==Crisis of 1051–52==

In ecclesiastical appointments, Edward and his advisers showed a bias against candidates with local connections, and when the clergy and monks of Canterbury elected a relative of Godwin as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1051, Edward rejected him and appointed Robert of Jumièges, who claimed that Godwin was in illegal possession of some archiepiscopal estates. In September 1051, Edward was visited by his brother-in-law, Godgifu&#x27;s second husband, Eustace II of Boulogne. His men caused an affray in Dover, and Edward ordered Godwin as earl of Kent to punish the town&#x27;s burgesses, but he took their side and refused. Edward seized the chance to bring his over-mighty earl to heel. Archbishop Robert accused Godwin of plotting to kill the king, just as he had killed his brother Alfred in 1036, while Leofric and Siward supported the king and called up their vassals. Sweyn and Harold called up their own vassals, but neither side wanted a fight, and Godwin and Sweyn appear to have each given a son as hostage, who were sent to Normandy. The Godwins&#x27; position disintegrated as their men were not willing to fight the king. When Stigand, who was acting as an intermediary, conveyed the king&#x27;s jest that Godwin could have his peace if he could restore Alfred and his companions alive and well, Godwin and his sons fled, going to Flanders and Ireland. Edward repudiated Edith and sent her to a nunnery, perhaps because she was childless, and Archbishop Robert urged her divorce.

Sweyn went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem (dying on his way back), but Godwin and his other sons returned, with an army following a year later, and received considerable support, while Leofric and Siward failed to support the king. Both sides were concerned that a civil war would leave the country open to foreign invasion. The king was furious, but he was forced to give way and restore Godwin and Harold to their earldoms, while Robert of Jumièges and other Frenchmen fled, fearing Godwin&#x27;s vengeance. Edith was restored as queen, and Stigand, who had again acted as an intermediary between the two sides in the crisis, was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in Robert&#x27;s place. Stigand retained his existing bishopric of Winchester, and his pluralism was a continuing source of dispute with the pope.
==Later reign==

Until the mid-1050s Edward was able to structure his earldoms to prevent the Godwins from becoming dominant. Godwin died in 1053, and although Harold succeeded to his earldom of Wessex, none of his other brothers were earls at this date. His house was then weaker than it had been since Edward&#x27;s succession, but a succession of deaths from 1055 to 1057 completely changed the control of earldoms. In 1055, Siward died, but his son was considered too young to command Northumbria, and Harold&#x27;s brother, Tostig, was appointed. In 1057, Leofric and Ralph died, and Leofric&#x27;s son Ælfgar succeeded as Earl of Mercia, while Harold&#x27;s brother Gyrth succeeded Ælfgar as Earl of East Anglia. The fourth surviving Godwin brother, Leofwine, was given an earldom in the south-east carved out of Harold&#x27;s territory, and Harold received Ralph&#x27;s territory in compensation. Thus by 1057, the Godwin brothers controlled all of England subordinately apart from Mercia. It is not known whether Edward approved of this transformation or whether he had to accept it, but from this time he seems to have begun to withdraw from active politics, devoting himself to hunting, which he pursued each day after attending church.

In the 1050s, Edward pursued an aggressive and generally successful policy in dealing with Scotland and Wales. Malcolm Canmore was an exile at Edward&#x27;s court after his father, Duncan I, was killed in battle in 1040, against men led by Macbeth who seized the Scottish throne. In 1054, Edward sent Siward to invade Scotland. He defeated Macbeth, and Malcolm, who had accompanied the expedition, gained control of southern Scotland. By 1058, Malcolm had killed Macbeth in battle and had taken the Scottish throne. In 1059, he visited Edward, but in 1061, he started raiding Northumbria with the aim of adding it to his territory.

In 1053, Edward ordered the assassination of the south Welsh prince Rhys ap Rhydderch in reprisal for a raid on England, and Rhys&#x27;s head was delivered to him. In 1055, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn established himself as the ruler of Wales, and allied himself with Ælfgar of Mercia, who had been outlawed for treason. They defeated Earl Ralph at Hereford, and Harold had to collect forces from nearly all of England to drive the invaders back into Wales. Peace was concluded with the reinstatement of Ælfgar, who was able to succeed as Earl of Mercia on his father&#x27;s death in 1057. Gruffydd swore an oath to be a faithful under-king of Edward. Ælfgar likely died in 1062, and his young son Edwin was allowed to succeed as Earl of Mercia, but Harold then launched a surprise attack on Gruffydd. He escaped, but when Harold and Tostig attacked again the following year, he retreated and was killed by Welsh enemies. Edward and Harold were then able to impose vassalage on some Welsh princes.
In October 1065, Harold&#x27;s brother, Tostig, Earl of Northumbria, was hunting with the king when his thegns in Northumbria rebelled against his rule, which they claimed was oppressive, and killed some 200 of his followers. They nominated Morcar, the brother of Edwin of Mercia, as earl and invited the brothers to join them in marching south. They met Harold at Northampton, and Tostig accused Harold before the king of conspiring with the rebels. Tostig seems to have been a favourite with the king and queen, who demanded that the revolt be suppressed, but neither Harold nor anyone else would fight to support Tostig.
Edward was forced to submit to his banishment, and the humiliation may have caused a series of strokes which led to his death. He was too weak to attend the consecration of his new church at Westminster, which had been substantially completed in 1065, on 28 December.

Edward probably entrusted the kingdom to Harold and Edith shortly before he died at Westminster on 5 January 1066. On 6 January he was buried in Westminster Abbey, and Harold was crowned on the same day.

==Succession==
Starting as early as William of Malmesbury in the early 12th century, historians have puzzled over Edward&#x27;s intentions for the succession. One school of thought supports the Norman case that Edward always intended William the Conqueror to be his heir, accepting the medieval claim that Edward had already decided to be celibate before he married, but most historians believe that he hoped to have an heir by Edith at least until his quarrel with Godwin in 1051. William the Conqueror&#x27;s grandfather, Duke Richard II, was the brother of Edward the Confessor&#x27;s mother, Emma of Normandy, so the two men were first cousins once removed, and there was a blood tie between them. William may have visited Edward during Godwin&#x27;s exile, and he is thought to have promised William the succession at this time, but historians disagree on how seriously he meant the promise, and whether he later changed his mind.

Edmund Ironside&#x27;s son, Edward the Exile, had the best claim to be considered Edward&#x27;s heir. He had been taken as a young child to Hungary, and in 1054 Bishop Ealdred of Worcester visited the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry III to secure his return, probably with a view to becoming Edward&#x27;s heir. The exile returned to England in 1057 with his family but died almost immediately. His son Edgar, who was then about six years old, was brought up at the English court. He was given the designation Ætheling, meaning throne-worthy, which may mean that Edward considered making him his heir, and he was briefly declared king after Harold&#x27;s death in 1066. However, Edgar was absent from witness lists of Edward&#x27;s diplomas, and there is no evidence in the Domesday Book that he was a substantial landowner, which suggests that he was marginalised at the end of Edward&#x27;s reign.

After the mid-1050s, Edward seems to have withdrawn from affairs as he became increasingly dependent on the Godwins, and he may have become reconciled to the idea that one of them would succeed him. The Normans claimed that Edward sent Harold to Normandy in about 1064 to confirm the promise of the succession to William. The strongest evidence comes from a Norman apologist, William of Poitiers. According to his account, shortly before the Battle of Hastings, Harold sent William an envoy who admitted that Edward had promised the throne to William but argued that this was overridden by his deathbed promise to Harold. In reply, William did not dispute the deathbed promise but argued that Edward&#x27;s prior promise to him took precedence. In Stephen Baxter&#x27;s view, Edward&#x27;s &quot;handling of the succession issue was dangerously indecisive, and contributed to one of the greatest catastrophes to which the English have ever succumbed.&quot;

==Westminster Abbey==
Edward&#x27;s Norman sympathies are most clearly seen in the major building project of his reign, Westminster Abbey, the first Norman Romanesque church in England. This was commenced between 1042 and 1052 as a royal burial church, consecrated on 28 December 1065, completed after his death in about 1090, and demolished in 1245 to make way for Henry III&#x27;s new building, which still stands. It was very similar to Jumièges Abbey, which was built at the same time. Robert of Jumièges must have been closely involved in both buildings, although it is not clear which is the original and which is the copy. Edward does not appear to have been interested in books and associated arts, but his abbey played a vital role in the development of English Romanesque architecture, showing that he was an innovative and generous patron of the church.

==Veneration==
Edward the Confessor was the only king of England to be canonized by the pope, but he was part of a tradition of (uncanonised) Anglo-Saxon royal saints, such as Eadburh of Winchester, a daughter of Edward the Elder, Edith of Wilton, a daughter of Edgar the Peaceful, and the boy-king Edward the Martyr. With his proneness to fits of rage and his love of hunting, Edward the Confessor is regarded by most historians as an unlikely saint, and his canonisation as political, although some argue that his cult started so early that it must have had something credible to build on.

Edward displayed a worldly attitude in his church appointments. When he appointed Robert of Jumièges as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1051, he chose the leading craftsman Spearhafoc to replace Robert as Bishop of London. Robert refused to consecrate him, saying that the pope had forbidden it, but Spearhafoc occupied the bishopric for several months with Edward&#x27;s support. After the Godwins fled the country, Edward expelled Spearhafoc, who fled with a large store of gold and gems which he had been given to make Edward a crown. Stigand was the first archbishop of Canterbury not to be a monk in almost a hundred years, and he was said to have been excommunicated by several popes because he held Canterbury and Winchester in plurality. Several bishops sought consecration abroad because of the irregularity of Stigand&#x27;s position. Edward usually preferred clerks to monks for the most important and richest bishoprics, and he probably accepted gifts from candidates for bishoprics and abbacies. However, his appointments were generally respectable. When Odda of Deerhurst died without heirs in 1056, Edward seized lands which Odda had granted to Pershore Abbey and gave them to his Westminster foundation; historian Ann Williams observes that &quot;the Confessor did not in the 11th century have the saintly reputation which he later enjoyed, largely through the efforts of the Westminster monks themselves&quot;.

After 1066, there was a subdued cult of Edward as a saint, possibly discouraged by the early Norman abbots of Westminster, which gradually increased in the early 12th century. Osbert of Clare, the prior of Westminster Abbey, then started to campaign for Edward&#x27;s canonisation, aiming to increase the wealth and power of the Abbey. By 1138, he had converted the &quot;Vita Ædwardi Regis&quot;, the life of Edward commissioned by his widow, into a conventional saint&#x27;s life. He seized on an ambiguous passage which might have meant that their marriage was chaste, perhaps to give the idea that Edith&#x27;s childlessness was not her fault, to claim that Edward had been celibate. In 1139, Osbert went to Rome to petition for Edward&#x27;s canonisation with the support of King Stephen, but he lacked the full support of the English hierarchy and Stephen had quarrelled with the church, so Pope Innocent II postponed a decision, declaring that Osbert lacked sufficient testimonials of Edward&#x27;s holiness.

In 1159, there was a disputed election to the papacy, and Henry II&#x27;s support helped to secure the recognition of Pope Alexander III. In 1160, a new abbot of Westminster, Laurence, seized the opportunity to renew Edward&#x27;s claim. This time, it had the full support of the king and the English hierarchy, and a grateful pope issued the bull of canonisation on 7 February 1161, the result of a conjunction of the interests of Westminster Abbey, King Henry II and Pope Alexander III. He was called &#x27;Confessor&#x27; as the name for someone who was believed to have lived a saintly life but was not a martyr. In the 1230s, King Henry III became attached to the cult of Saint Edward, and he commissioned a new life, by Matthew Paris. Henry also constructed a grand new tomb for Edward in a rebuilt Westminster Abbey in 1269. Henry III also named his eldest son after Edward.

Until about 1350, Edmund the Martyr, Gregory the Great, and Edward the Confessor were regarded as English national saints, but Edward III preferred the more war-like figure of Saint George, and in 1348 he established the Order of the Garter with Saint George as its patron. At Windsor Castle, its chapel of Saint Edward the Confessor was re-dedicated to Saint George, who was acclaimed in 1351 as patron of the English race. Edward was a less popular saint for many, but he was important to the Norman dynasty, which claimed to be the successor of Edward as the last legitimate Anglo-Saxon king.

The shrine of Saint Edward the Confessor in Westminster Abbey remains where it was after the final translation of his body to a chapel east of the sanctuary on 13 October 1269 by Henry III. The day of his translation, 13 October (his first translation had also been on that date in 1163), is an optional memorial in the Catholic dioceses of England only. Saint Edward may also be commemorated on the anniversary of his death, 5 January, the date he is inscribed in the &quot;Martyrologium Romanum&quot;. The Church of England&#x27;s calendar of saints designates 13 October as a Lesser Festival. Each October the abbey holds a week of festivities and prayer in his honour. Edward is also regarded as a patron saint of difficult marriages.

==Appearance and character==
The &quot;Vita Ædwardi Regis&quot; states &quot;[H]e was a very proper figure of a man – of outstanding height, and distinguished by his milky white hair and beard, full face and rosy cheeks, thin white hands, and long translucent fingers; in all the rest of his body he was an unblemished royal person. Pleasant, but always dignified, he walked with eyes downcast, most graciously affable to one and all. If some cause aroused his temper, he seemed as terrible as a lion, but he never revealed his anger by railing.&quot; This, as the historian Richard Mortimer notes, &#x27;contains obvious elements of the ideal king, expressed in flattering terms – tall and distinguished, affable, dignified and just.&#x27;

Edward was allegedly not above accepting bribes. According to the Ramsey &quot;Liber Benefactorum&quot;, the monastery&#x27;s abbot decided that it would be dangerous to publicly contest a claim brought by &quot;a certain powerful man&quot;, but he claimed he was able to procure a favourable judgment by giving Edward twenty marks in gold and his wife five marks.

<doc id="40245" wikidata="Q1529024" url="?curid=40245" title="Halotolerance">
<text>Halotolerance is the adaptation of living organisms to conditions of high salinity. Halotolerant species tend to live in areas such as hypersaline lakes, coastal dunes, saline deserts, salt marshes, and inland salt seas and springs. Halophiles are organisms that live in highly saline environments, and require the salinity to survive, while halotolerant organisms (belonging to different domains of life) can grow under saline conditions, but do not require elevated concentrations of salt for growth. Halophytes are salt-tolerant higher plants. Halotolerant microorganisms are of considerable biotechnological interest.

==Applications==
Fields of scientific research relevant to halotolerance include biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, physiology, ecology, and genetics.

An understanding of halotolerance can be applicable to areas such as arid-zone agriculture, xeriscaping, aquaculture (of fish or algae), bioproduction of desirable compounds (such as phycobiliproteins or carotenoids) using seawater to support growth, or remediation of salt-affected soils. In addition, many environmental stressors involve or induce osmotic changes, so knowledge gained about halotolerance can also be relevant to understanding tolerance to extremes in moisture or temperature.

Goals of studying halotolerance include increasing the agricultural productivity of lands affected by soil salination or where only saline water is available. Conventional agricultural species could be made more halotolerant by gene transfer from naturally halotolerant species (by conventional breeding or genetic engineering) or by applying treatments developed from an understanding of the mechanisms of halotolerance. In addition, naturally halotolerant plants or microorganisms could be developed into useful agricultural crops or fermentation organisms.

==Cellular functions in halophytes==
Tolerance of high salt conditions can be obtained through several routes. High levels of salt entering the plant can trigger ionic imbalances which cause complications in respiration and photosynthesis, leading to reduced rates of growth, injury and death in severe cases. To be considered tolerant of saline conditions, the protoplast must show methods of balancing the toxic and osmotic effects of the increased salt concentrations. Halophytic vascular plants can survive on soils with salt concentrations around 6%, or up to 20% in extreme cases. Tolerance of such conditions is reached through the use of stress proteins and compatible cytoplasm osmotic solutes.

To exist in such conditions, halophytes tend to be subject to the uptake of high levels of salt into their cells, and this is often required to maintain an osmotic potential lower than that of the soil to ensure water uptake. High salt concentrations within the cell can be damaging to sensitive organelles such as the chloroplast, so sequestration of salt is seen. Under this action, salt is stored within the vacuole to protect such delicate areas. If high salt concentrations are seen within the vacuole, a high concentration gradient will be established between the vacuole and the cytoplasm, leading to high levels of energy investment to maintain this state. Therefore, the accumulation of compatible cytoplasmic osmotic solutes can be seen to prevent this situation from occurring. Amino acids such as proline accumulate in halophytic Brassica species, quaternary ammonium bases such as Glycine Betaine and sugars have been shown to act in this role within halophytic members of Chenopodiaceae and members of Asteraceae show the buildup of cyclites and soluble sugars. The buildup of these compounds allow for the balancing of the osmotic effect while preventing the establishment of toxic concentrations of salt or requiring the maintenance of high concentration gradients.

==Bacterial halotolerance==
The extent of halotolerance varies widely amongst different species of bacteria. A number of cyanobacteria are halotolerant; an example location of occurrence for such cyanobacteria is in the Makgadikgadi Pans, a large hypersaline lake in Botswana.

==Fungal halotolerance==
Fungi from habitats with high concentration of salt are mostly halotolerant (i.e. they do not require salt for growth) and not halophilic. Halophilic fungi are a rare exception. Halotolerant fungi constitute a relatively large and constant part of hypersaline environment communities, such as those in the solar salterns. Well studied examples include the yeast &quot;Debaryomyces hansenii &quot;and black yeasts &quot;Aureobasidium pullulans&quot; and &quot;Hortaea werneckii&quot;. The latter can grow in media without salt, as well as in almost saturated NaCl solutions. To emphasize this unusually wide adaptability, some authors describe &quot;H. werneckii &quot;as &quot;extremely halotolerant&quot;.

<doc id="40247" wikidata="Q3924052" url="?curid=40247" title="Pulsed inductive thruster">
<text>A pulsed inductive thruster (PIT) is a form of ion thruster, used in spacecraft propulsion. It is a plasma propulsion engine using perpendicular electric and magnetic fields to accelerate a propellant with no electrode.

== Operation ==

A nozzle releases a puff of gas which spreads across a flat spiraling induction coil of wire about 1 meter across. A bank of capacitors releases a pulse of high voltage electric current of tens of kilovolts lasting 10 microseconds into the coil, generating a radial magnetic field. This induces a circular electrical field in the gas, ionizing it and causing charged particles (free electrons and ions) to revolve in the opposite direction as the original pulse of current. Because the motion of this induced current flow is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the plasma is accelerated out into space by the Lorentz force at a high exhaust velocity (10 to 100 km/s).

== Advantages ==

Unlike an electrostatic ion thruster which uses an electric field to accelerate only one species (positive ions), a PIT uses the Lorentz body force acting upon all charged particles within a quasi-neutral plasma. Unlike most other ion and plasma thrusters, it also requires no electrodes (which are susceptible to erosion) and its power can be scaled up simply by increasing the number of pulses per second. A 1-megawatt system would pulse 200 times per second.

Pulsed inductive thrusters can maintain constant specific impulse and thrust efficiency over a wide range of input power levels by adjusting the pulse rate to maintain a constant discharge energy per pulse. It has demonstrated efficiency greater than 50%.

Pulsed inductive thrusters can use a wide range of gases as a propellant, such as water, hydrazine, ammonia, argon, or xenon, among many others. Due to this ability, it has been suggested to use PITs for Martian missions: an orbiter could refuel by scooping CO2 from the atmosphere of Mars, compressing the gas and liquefying it into storage tanks for the return journey or another interplanetary mission, whilst orbiting the planet.

== Developments ==

Early development began with fundamental proof-of-concept studies performed in the mid-1960s. NASA conducts experiments on this device since the early 1980s.

=== PIT Mk V, VI and VII ===

NGST (Northrop Grumman Space Technology), as a contractor for NASA, built several experimental PITs.

Research efforts during the first period (1965–1973) were aimed at understanding the structure of an inductive current sheet and evaluating different concepts for propellant injection and preionization.

In the second period (1979–1988), the focus shifted more towards developing a true propulsion system and increasing the performance of the base design through incremental design changes, with the build of &quot;Mk I&quot; and &quot;Mk IV&quot; prototypes.

The third period (1991-today) began with the introduction of a new PIT thruster design known as the &quot;Mk V&quot;. It evolved into the &quot;Mk VI&quot;, developed to reproduce Mk V single-shot tests, which completely characterize thruster performance. It uses an improved coil of hollow copper tube construction and an improved propellant valve, but is electrically identical to the Mk V, using the same capacitors and switches. The &quot;Mk VII&quot; (early 2000s) has the same geometry as Mk VI, but is designed for high pulse frequency and long-duration firing with a liquid-cooled coil, longer-life capacitors, and fast, high-power solid-state switches. The goal for Mk VII is to demonstrate up to 50 pulses per second at the rated efficiency and impulse bit at 200 kW of input power in a single thruster. Mk VII design is the base for the most recent &quot;NuPIT&quot; (Nuclear-electric PIT).

The PIT has obtained relatively high performance in the laboratory environment, but it still requires additional advancements in switching technology and energy storage before becoming practical for high-power in-space applications, with the need for a nuclear-based onboard power source.

=== FARAD ===

&quot;FARAD&quot;, which stands for &quot;Faraday accelerator with radio-frequency assisted discharge&quot;, is a lower-power alternative to the PIT that has the potential for space operation using current technologies.

In the PIT, both propellant ionization and acceleration are performed by the HV pulse of current in the induction coil, while FARAD uses a separate inductive RF discharge to preionize the propellant before it is accelerated by the current pulse. This preionization allows FARAD to operate at much
lower discharge energies than the PIT (100 joules per pulse vs 4 kilojoules per pulse) and allows for a reduction in the thruster&#x27;s size.

<text>The Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) is an electrothermal thruster under development for possible use in spacecraft propulsion. It uses radio waves to ionize and heat an inert propellant, forming a plasma, then a magnetic field to confine and accelerate the expanding plasma, generating thrust. It is a plasma propulsion engine, one of several types of spacecraft electric propulsion systems.

The VASIMR method for heating plasma was originally developed during nuclear fusion research. VASIMR is intended to bridge the gap between high thrust, low specific impulse chemical rockets and low thrust, high specific impulse electric propulsion, but has not yet demonstrated high thrust. The VASIMR concept originated in 1977 with former NASA astronaut Franklin Chang Díaz, who has been developing the technology ever since.

==Design and operation==
VASIMR is a type of electrothermal plasma thruster/electrothermal magnetoplasma thruster. In these engines, a neutral, inert propellant is ionized and heated using radio waves. The resulting plasma is then accelerated with magnetic fields to generate thrust. Other related electrically powered spacecraft propulsion concepts are the electrodeless plasma thruster, the microwave arcjet rocket, and the pulsed inductive thruster. 

The propellant, a neutral gas such as argon or xenon, is injected into a hollow cylinder surfaced with electromagnets. On entering the engine, the gas is first heated to a &quot;cold plasma&quot; by a helicon RF antenna/coupler that bombards the gas with electromagnetic energy, at a frequency of 10 to 50 MHz, stripping electrons off the propellant atoms and producing a plasma of ions and free electrons. By varying the amount of RF heating energy and plasma, VASIMR is claimed to be capable of generating either low-thrust, high–specific impulse exhaust or relatively high-thrust, low–specific impulse exhaust. The second phase of the engine is a strong solenoid-configuration electromagnet that channels the ionized plasma, acting as a convergent-divergent nozzle like the physical nozzle in conventional rocket engines.

A second coupler, known as the Ion Cyclotron Heating (ICH) section, emits electromagnetic waves in resonance with the orbits of ions and electrons as they travel through the engine. Resonance is achieved through a reduction of the magnetic field in this portion of the engine that slows the orbital motion of the plasma particles. This section further heats the plasma to greater than —about 173 times the temperature of the Sun&#x27;s surface.

The path of ions and electrons through the engine approximates lines parallel to the engine walls; however, the particles actually orbit those lines while traveling linearly through the engine. The final, diverging, section of the engine contains an expanding magnetic field that ejects the ions and electrons from the engine at velocities as great as .

===Advantages===
In contrast to the typical cyclotron resonance heating processes, VASIMR ions are immediately ejected from the magnetic nozzle before they achieve thermalized distribution. Based on novel theoretical work in 2004 by Alexey V. Arefiev and Boris N. Breizman of University of Texas at Austin, virtually all of the energy in the ion cyclotron wave is uniformly transferred to ionized plasma in a single-pass cyclotron absorption process. This allows for ions to leave the magnetic nozzle with a very narrow energy distribution, and for significantly simplified and compact magnet arrangement in the engine.

VASIMR does not use electrodes; instead, it magnetically shields plasma from most hardware parts, thus eliminating electrode erosion, a major source of wear in ion engines. Compared to traditional rocket engines with very complex plumbing, high performance valves, actuators and turbopumps, VASIMR has almost no moving parts (apart from minor ones, like gas valves), maximizing long term durability.

===Disadvantages===
According to Ad Astra as of 2015, the VX-200 engine requires 200 kW electrical power to produce of thrust, or 40 kW/N. In contrast, the conventional NEXT ion thruster produces 0.327 N with only 7.7 kW, or 24 kW/N. Electrically speaking, NEXT is almost twice as efficient, and successfully completed a 48,000 hours (5.5 years) test in December 2009.

New problems also emerge with VASIMR, such as interaction with strong magnetic fields and thermal management. The inefficiency with which VASIMR operates generates substantial waste heat that needs to be channeled away without creating thermal overload and thermal stress. The superconducting electromagnets necessary to contain hot plasma generate tesla-range magnetic fields that can cause problems with other onboard devices and produce unwanted torque by interaction with the magnetosphere. To counter this latter effect, two thruster units can be packaged with magnetic fields oriented in opposite directions, making a net zero-torque magnetic quadrupole.

==Research and development==
The first VASIMR experiment was conducted at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1983. Important refinements were introduced in the 1990s, including the use of the helicon plasma source, which replaced the plasma gun originally envisioned and its electrodes, adding to durability and long life.

As of 2010, Ad Astra Rocket Company (AARC) was responsible for VASIMR development, signing the first Space Act Agreement on 23 June 2005 to privatize VASIMR technology. Franklin Chang Díaz is Ad Astra&#x27;s chairman and CEO, and the company had a testing facility in Liberia, Costa Rica on the campus of Earth University.

===VX-10 to VX-50===
In 1998, the first helicon plasma experiment was performed at the ASPL. VASIMR experiment 10 (VX-10) in 1998 achieved a helicon RF plasma discharge of up to 10 kW and VX-25 in 2002 of up to 25 kW. By 2005 progress at ASPL included full and efficient plasma production and acceleration of the plasma ions with the 50 kW, thrust VX-50. Published data on the 50 kW VX-50 showed the electrical efficiency to be 59% based on a 90% coupling efficiency and a 65% ion speed boosting efficiency.

===VX-100===
The 100 kilowatt VASIMR experiment was successfully running by 2007 and demonstrated efficient plasma production with an ionization cost below 100eV. VX-100 plasma output tripled the prior record of the VX-50.

The VX-100 was expected to have an ion speed boosting efficiency of 80%, but could not achieve this efficiency due to losses from the conversion of DC electric current to radio frequency power and the auxiliary equipment for the superconducting magnet. In contrast, 2009 state-of-the-art, proven ion engine designs such as NASA&#x27;s High Power Electric Propulsion (HiPEP) operated at 80% total thruster/PPU energy efficiency.

===VX-200===

On 24 October 2008, the company announced in a press release that the helicon plasma generation component of the 200 kW VX-200 engine had reached operational status. The key enabling technology, solid-state DC-RF power-processing, reached 98% efficiency. The helicon discharge used 30 kW of radio waves to turn argon gas into plasma. The remaining 170 kW of power was allocated for acceleration of plasma in the second part of the engine, via ion cyclotron resonance heating.

Based on data from VX-100 testing, it was expected that, if room temperature superconductors are ever discovered, the VX-200 engine would have a system efficiency of 60–65% and a potential thrust level of 5 N. Optimal specific impulse appeared to be around 5,000 s using low cost argon propellant. One of the remaining untested issues was whether the hot plasma actually detached from the rocket. Another issue was waste heat management. About 60% of input energy became useful kinetic energy. Much of the remaining 40% is secondary ionizations from plasma crossing magnetic field lines and exhaust divergence. A significant portion of that 40% was waste heat (see energy conversion efficiency). Managing and rejecting that waste heat is critical.

Between April and September 2009, 200 kW tests were performed on the VX-200 prototype with 2 tesla superconducting magnets that are powered separately and not accounted for in any &quot;efficiency&quot; calculations. During November 2010, long duration, full power firing tests were performed, reaching steady state operation for 25 seconds and validating basic design characteristics.

Results presented in January 2011 confirmed that the design point for optimal efficiency on the VX-200 is 50 km/s exhaust velocity, or an &quot;I&quot; of 5000s. The 200 kW VX-200 had executed more than 10,000 engine firings with argon propellant at full power by 2013, demonstrating greater than 70% thruster efficiency relative to RF power input.

====VX-200SS====
In March 2015, Ad Astra announced a $10 million award from NASA to advance the technology readiness of the next version of the VASIMR engine, the VX-200SS to meet the needs of deep space missions. The SS in the name stands for &quot;steady state&quot;, as a goal of the long duration test is to demonstrate continuous operation at thermal steady state.

In August 2016, Ad Astra announced completion of the milestones for the first year of its 3-year contract with NASA. This allowed for first high-power plasma firings of the engines, with a stated goal to reach 100hr and 100 kW by mid-2018. In August 2017, the company reported completing its Year 2 milestones for the VASIMR electric plasma rocket engine. NASA gave approval for Ad Astra to proceed with Year 3 after reviewing completion of a 10-hour cumulative test of the VX-200SS engine at 100kW. It appears as though the planned 200 kW design is being run at 100 kW for reasons that are not mentioned in the press release. 
In August 2019, Ad Astra announced the successful completion of tests of a new generation radio-frequency (RF) Power Processing Unit (PPU) for the VASIMR engine, built by Aethera Technologies Ltd. of Canada. Ad Astra declared a power of 120 kW and &gt;97% electrical-to-RF power efficiency, and that, at 52 kg, the new RF PPU is about 10x lighter than the PPUs of competing electric thrusters (power-to-weight ratio: 2.31 kW/kg)

In July 2021, Ad Astra announced the completion of a record-breaking test for the engine, running it for 28 hours at a power level of 82.5kW. A second test, conducted from July 12 to 16, successfully ran the engine for 88 hours at a power level of 80kW. Ad Astra anticipates conducting 100kW power level tests in 2023.

==Potential applications==
VASIMR has a comparatively poor thrust-to-weight ratio, and requires an ambient vacuum.

Proposed applications for VASIMR such as the rapid transportation of people to Mars would require a very high power, low mass energy source, ten times more efficient than a nuclear reactor (see nuclear electric rocket). In 2010 NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said that VASIMR technology could be the breakthrough technology that would reduce the travel time on a Mars mission from 2.5 years to 5 months. However this claim has not been repeated in the last decade.

In August 2008, Tim Glover, Ad Astra director of development, publicly stated that the first expected application of VASIMR engine is &quot;hauling things [non-human cargo] from low-Earth orbit to low-lunar orbit&quot; supporting NASA&#x27;s return to Moon efforts.

===Mars in 39 days===
In order to conduct an imagined crewed trip to Mars in 39 days, the VASIMR would require a very high electrical power level.

On top of that, any power generation technology will produce waste heat. The necessary 200 megawatt reactor &quot;with a power-to-mass density of 1,000 watts per kilogram&quot; would require extremely efficient radiators to avoid the need for &quot;football-field sized radiators&quot;.

<doc id="40249" wikidata="Q1944508" url="?curid=40249" title="Mongolian writing systems">
<text>Various Mongolian writing systems have been devised for the Mongolian language over the centuries, and from a variety of scripts. The oldest and native script, called simply the Mongolian script, has been the predominant script during most of Mongolian history, and is still in active use today in the Inner Mongolia region of China and has &quot;de facto&quot; use in Mongolia. 

It has in turn spawned several alphabets, either as attempts to fix its perceived shortcomings, or to allow the notation of other languages, such as Chinese, Sanskrit and Tibetan. In the 20th century, Mongolia briefly switched to the Latin script, but then almost immediately replaced it with the modified Cyrillic alphabet because of its smaller discrepancy between written and spoken form, contributing to the success of the literacy campaign, which increased the literacy rate from 17.3% to 73.5% between 1941 and 1950 Nevertheless, Mongols living in Inner Mongolia as well as other parts of China continued to use alphabets based on the traditional Mongolian script.

In March 2020, the Government of Mongolia announced plans to use the traditional Mongolian script alongside the Cyrillic script in official documents (e.g. identity documents, academic certificates, birth certificates, marriage certificates, among others) as well as the State Great Khural by 2025, although the Cyrillic script could be used alone on an optional basis for less official writing.

== Precursors ==

The Xianbei spoke a proto-Mongolic language and wrote down several pieces of literature in their language. They are believed to have used Chinese characters to phonetically represent Xianbei, like the Japanese system of Man&#x27;yōgana with Chinese, but all works written in Xianbei are now lost.

In 2019, with the emergence of new evidence through the analysis of the &quot;Brāhmī Bugut&quot; and &quot;Khüis Tolgoi&quot;, Rouran language was deciphered, and Rouran was spelled in Brahmi script.

The Khitan spoke another proto-Mongolic language and developed two scripts for writing it: Khitan large script and Khitan small script, logographic scripts derived from Chinese characters.

== Classic Mongolian scripts ==

===Traditional alphabet===

At the very beginning of the Mongol Empire, around 1204, Genghis Khan defeated the Naimans and captured a Uyghur scribe called Tata-tonga, who then adapted the Uyghur alphabet—a descendant of the Syriac alphabet, via Sogdian—to write Mongol. With only minor modifications, it is used in Inner Mongolia to this day. Its most salient feature is its vertical direction; it is the only vertical script still in use that is written from left to right. (All other vertical writing systems are written right to left.) This is because the Uyghurs rotated their script 90 degrees anticlockwise to emulate the Chinese writing system.

As a variant of the traditional script there exists a &quot;vertical square script&quot; (Босоо дөрвөлжин), also called &quot;folded script&quot;, used e.g. on the Mongolian banknotes.

=== Galik alphabet ===

In 1587, the translator and scholar Ayuush Güüsh created the Galik alphabet, inspired by Sonam Gyatso, the third Dalai Lama. It primarily added extra letters to transcribe Tibetan and Sanskrit terms in religious texts, and later also from Chinese and Russian. Later some of these letters were officially merged into traditional alphabet as a group named &quot;Galig usug&quot; to transcribe foreign words in modern use.
=== Todo alphabet ===

In 1648, the Oirat Buddhist monk Zaya Pandita created this variation with the goal of bringing the written language closer to the actual Oirat pronunciation, and to make it easier to transcribe Tibetan and Sanskrit. The script was used by Kalmyks of Russia until 1924, when it was replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet. In Xinjiang, China, the Oirats still use it.

== &#x27;Phags-pa script (Square script)==
The traditional Mongolian alphabet is not a perfect fit for the Mongolian language, and it would be impractical to extend it to a language with a very different phonology like Chinese. Therefore, during the Yuan dynasty (), Kublai Khan asked a Tibetan monk, Drogön Chögyal Phagpa, to design a new script for use by the whole empire. Phagpa extended his native Tibetan script to encompass Mongolian and Chinese; the result was known by several descriptive names, such as the &quot;Mongolian new script&quot;, but today is known as the &#x27;Phags-pa script. The script did not receive wide acceptance and fell into disuse with the collapse of the Yuan dynasty in 1368. After this it was mainly used as a phonetic gloss for Mongols learning Chinese characters. However, scholars such as Gari Ledyard believe that in the meantime it was the source of some of the basic letters of the Korean hangul alphabet.

== Soyombo script ==
The Soyombo script is an abugida created by the Mongolian monk and scholar Bogdo Zanabazar in the late 17th century, that can also be used to write Tibetan and Sanskrit. A special glyph in the script, the Soyombo symbol, became a national symbol of Mongolia, and has appeared on the national flag since 1921, and on the national coat of arms since 1992, as well as money, stamps, etc.

Zanabazar had created it for the translation of Buddhist texts from Sanskrit or Tibetan, and both he and his students used it extensively for that purpose. Aside from historical texts, it can usually be found in temple inscriptions. It also has some relevance to linguistic research, because it reflects certain developments in the Mongolian language, such as that of long vowels.

== Horizontal square script ==
At around the same time, Zanabazar also developed the &quot;horizontal square script&quot; (Хэвтээ дөрвөлжин), which was only rediscovered in 1801. The script&#x27;s applications during the period of its use are not known. It was also largely based on the Tibetan alphabet, read left to right, and employed vowel diacritics above and below the consonant letters. Additionally, a dot was used below consonants to show that they were syllable-final.

Horizontal square script is included in the Unicode Standard under the name &quot;Zanabazar Square&quot;. The Zanabazar Square block, comprising 72 characters, was added as part of Unicode version 10.0 in June 2017.

== Foreign scripts ==
Before the 13th century, foreign scripts such as the Uighur and the Tibetan scripts were used to write the Mongolian language. Even during the reign of the Mongol Empire, people in the conquered areas often wrote it in their local systems. In some cases it was transcribed phonetically using Chinese characters, as is the case with the only surviving copies of &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;. Subjects from the Middle East hired into administrative functions would also often use Perso-Arabic script to write their Mongolian language documents.

=== Latin script ===
On 1 February 1930, Mongolia officially adopted a Latin alphabet. On 25 March 1941, the decision was reversed. According to later official claims, the alphabet had turned out to have not been thought out well. It was said not to distinguish all the sounds of the Mongolian language, and was difficult to use. Using &quot;y&quot; as feminine &quot;u&quot; , with additional feminine &quot;o&quot; (&quot;ө&quot;) and with additional consonants &quot;ç&quot; for &quot;ch&quot; , &quot;ş&quot; for &quot;sh&quot; and ƶ for &quot;zh&quot; , it successfully served in printing books and newspapers. Many of the Latin letters (f, h, p, v) were even rarely used while q, w and x were completely excluded. The adoption of the Cyrillic script a short time later, almost simultaneously with most Soviet republics, suggests political reasons. In the advent of the Internet, people who use social networking services prefer typing in the Latin script for the ease of typing compared to the Cyrillic script, using the orthography introduced in 1939.

=== Cyrillic script ===

The most recent Mongolian alphabet is based on the Cyrillic script, more specifically the Russian alphabet plus the letters, Өө &quot;Öö&quot; and Үү &quot;Üü&quot;. It was introduced in the 1940s and has been in use as the official writing system of Mongolia ever since.

In March 2020, the Government of Mongolia announced plans to use the traditional Mongolian script alongside Cyrillic in official documents starting from 2025.

<doc id="40250" wikidata="Q51504" url="?curid=40250" title="Specific impulse">
<text>Specific impulse (usually abbreviated ) is a measure of how efficiently a reaction mass engine, such as a rocket using propellant or a jet engine using fuel, generates thrust. In general, this is a ratio of the &quot;impulse&quot;, i.e. change in momentum, &quot;per mass&quot; of propellant. This is equivalent to &quot;thrust per massflow&quot;. The resulting unit is equivalent to velocity, although it does not represent any physical velocity (see below); it is more properly thought of in terms of momentum per mass, since this represents a physical momentum and physical mass.

The practical meaning of the measurement varies with different types of engines. Car engines consume onboard fuel, breathe environmental air to burn the fuel, and react (through the tires) against the ground beneath them. In this case, the only sensible interpretation is momentum per fuel burned. Chemical rocket engines, by contrast, carry aboard all of their combustion ingredients and reaction mass, so the only practical measure is momentum per reaction mass. Airplane engines are in the middle, as they only react against airflow through the engine, but some of this reaction mass (and combustion ingredients) is breathed rather than carried on board. As such, &quot;specific impulse&quot; could be taken to mean either &quot;per reaction mass&quot;, as with a rocket, or &quot;per fuel burned&quot; as with cars. The latter is the traditional and common choice. In sum, specific impulse is not practically comparable between different types of engines.

In any case, specific impulse can be taken as a measure of efficiency. In cars and planes, it typically corresponds with fuel mileage; in rocketry, it corresponds to the achievable delta-&quot;v&quot;, which is the typical way to measure changes between orbits.

Rocketry traditionally uses a &quot;bizarre&quot; choice of units: rather than speaking of momentum-per-mass, or velocity, the rocket industry typically converts units of velocity to units of time by dividing by a standard reference acceleration, that being standard gravity g. This is a historical result of competing units, imperial units vs metric units. They shared a common unit of time (seconds) but not common units of distance or mass, so this conversion by reference to g became a standard way to make international comparisons. This choice of reference conversion is arbitrary and the resulting units of time have no physical meaning. The only physical quantities are the momentum change and the mass used to achieve it.

==Propulsion systems==

===Rockets===
For any chemical rocket engine, the momentum transfer efficiency depends heavily on the effectiveness of the nozzle; the nozzle is the primary means of converting reactant energy (e.g. thermal or pressure energy) into a flow of momentum all directed the same way. Therefore, nozzle shape and effectiveness has a great impact on total momentum transfer from the reaction mass to the rocket. 

Efficiency of conversion of input energy to reactant energy also matters; be that thermal energy in combustion engines or electrical energy in ion engines, the engineering involved in converting such energy to outbound momentum can have high impact on specific impulse. Specific impulse in turn has deep impacts on the achievable delta-v and associated orbits achievable, and (by the rocket equation) mass fraction required to achieve a given delta-v. Optimizing the tradeoffs between mass fraction and specific impulse is one of the fundamental engineering challenges in rocketry.

Although the specific impulse has units equivalent to velocity, it almost never corresponds to any physical velocity. In chemical and cold gas rockets, the shape of the nozzle has a high impact on the energy-to-momentum conversion, and is never perfect, and there are other sources of losses and inefficiencies (e.g. the details of the combustion in such engines). As such, the physical exhaust velocity is higher than the &quot;effective exhaust velocity&quot;, i.e. that &quot;velocity&quot; suggested by the specific impulse. In any case, the momentum exchanged and the mass used to generate it &quot;are&quot; physically real measurements. Typically, rocket nozzles work better when the ambient pressure is lower, i.e. better in space than in atmosphere. Ion engines operate without a nozzle, although they have other sources of losses such that the momentum transferred is lower than the physical exhaust velocity.

===Cars===
Although the car industry almost never uses specific impulse on any practical level, the measure can be defined, and makes good contrast against other engine types. Car engines breathe external air to combust their fuel, and (via the wheels) react against the ground. As such, the only meaningful way to interpret &quot;specific impulse&quot; is as &quot;thrust per fuelflow&quot;, although one must also specify if the force is measured at the crankshaft or at the wheels, since there are transmission losses. Such a measure corresponds to fuel mileage.

===Airplanes===
In an aerodynamic context, there are similarities to both cars and rockets. Like cars, airplane engines breathe outside air; unlike cars they react only against fluids flowing through the engine (including the propellers as applicable). As such, there are several possible ways to interpret &quot;specific impulse&quot;: as thrust per fuel flow, as thrust per breathing-flow, or as thrust per &quot;turbine-flow&quot; (i.e. excluding air though the propeller/bypass fan). Since the air breathed is not a direct cost, with wide engineering leeway on how much to breathe, the industry traditionally chooses the &quot;thrust per fuel flow&quot; interpretation with its focus on cost efficiency. In this interpretation, the resulting specific impulse numbers are much higher than for rocket engines, although this comparison is essentially meaningless since the interpretations — with or without reaction mass — are so different.

As with all kinds of engines, there are many engineering choices and tradeoffs that affect specific impulse. Nonlinear air resistance and the engine&#x27;s inability to keep a high specific impulse at a fast burn rate are limiting factors to the fuel consumption rate.

As with rocket engines, the interpretation of specific impulse as a &quot;velocity&quot; has no physical meaning. Since the usual interpretation excludes much of the reaction mass, the physical velocity of the reactants downstream is much lower than the I &quot;velocity&quot;.

==General considerations==
Specific impulse should not be confused with energy efficiency, which can decrease as specific impulse increases, since propulsion systems that give high specific impulse require high energy to do so.

Specific impulse should not be confused with total thrust. Thrust is the force supplied by the engine and depends on the propellant mass flow through the engine. Specific impulse measures the thrust &quot;per&quot; propellant mass flow. Thrust and specific impulse are related by the design and propellants of the engine in question, but this relationship is tenuous: in most cases, high thrust and high specific impulse are mutually exclusive engineering goals. For example, LH2/LO bipropellant produces higher (due to higher chemical energy and lower exhaust molecular mass) but lower thrust than RP-1/LO (due to higher density and propellant flow). In many cases, propulsion systems with very high specific impulse—some ion thrusters reach 25x-35x better than chemical engines—produce correspondingly low thrust. 

When calculating specific impulse, only propellant carried with the vehicle before use is counted, in the standard interpretation. This usage best corresponds to the cost of operating the vehicle. For a chemical rocket, unlike a plane or car, the propellant mass therefore would include both fuel and oxidizer. For any vehicle, optimising for specific impulse is generally not the same as optimising for total performance or total cost. In rocketry, a heavier engine with a higher specific impulse may not be as effective in gaining altitude, distance, or velocity as a lighter engine with a lower specific impulse, especially if the latter engine possesses a higher thrust-to-weight ratio. This is a significant reason for most rocket designs having multiple stages. The first stage can optimised for high thrust to effectively fight gravity drag and air drag, while the later stages operating strictly in orbit and in vacuum can be much easier optimised for higher specific impulse, especially for high delta-v orbits.

===Propellant quantity units===
The amount of propellant could be defined either in units of mass or weight. If mass is used, specific impulse is an impulse per unit of mass, which dimensional analysis shows to be equivalent to units of speed; this interpretation is commonly labeled the &quot;effective exhaust velocity&quot;. If a force-based unit system is used, impulse is divided by propellant weight (weight is a measure of force), resulting in units of time. The problem with weight, as a measure of quantity, is that it depends on the acceleration applied to the propellant, which is arbitrary with no relation to the design of the engine. Historically, standard gravity was the reference conversion between weight and mass. But since technology has progressed to the point that we can measure Earth gravity&#x27;s variation across the surface, and where such differences can cause differences in practical engineering projects (not to mention science projects on other solar bodies), modern science and engineering focus on mass as the measure of quantity, so as to remove the acceleration dependence. As such, measuring specific impulse by propellant mass gives it the same meaning for a car at sea level, an airplane at cruising altitude, or a helicopter on Mars.

No matter the choice of mass or weight, the resulting quotient of &quot;velocity&quot; or &quot;time&quot; has no physical meaning. Due to various losses in real engines, the actual exhaust velocity is different from the I &quot;velocity&quot; (and for cars there isn&#x27;t even a sensible definition of &quot;actual exhaust velocity&quot;). Rather, the specific impulse is just that: a physical momentum from a physical quantity of propellant (be that in mass or weight).

The particular habit in rocketry of measuring I in seconds results from the above historical circumstances. Since metric and imperial units had in common only the unit of time, this was the most convenient way to make international comparisons. However, the choice of reference acceleration conversion, (g) is arbitrary, and as above, the interpretation in terms of time or speed has no physical meaning.

==Units==

The most common unit for specific impulse is the second, as values are identical regardless of whether the calculations are done in SI, imperial, or US customary units. Nearly all manufacturers quote their engine performance in seconds, and the unit is also useful for specifying aircraft engine performance.

The use of metres per second to specify effective exhaust velocity is also reasonably common. The unit is intuitive when describing rocket engines, although the effective exhaust speed of the engines may be significantly different from the actual exhaust speed, especially in gas-generator cycle engines. For airbreathing jet engines, the effective exhaust velocity is not physically meaningful, although it can be used for comparison purposes.

Metres per second are numerically equivalent to newton-seconds per kg (N·s/kg), and SI measurements of specific impulse can be written in terms of either units interchangeably. This unit highlights the definition of specific impulse as impulse per unit mass of propellant.

Specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to specific impulse and has units of g/(kN·s) or lb/(lbf·h). Specific fuel consumption is used extensively for describing the performance of air-breathing jet engines.

===Specific impulse in seconds===

Specific impulse, measured in seconds, can be thought of as how many seconds one kilogram of fuel can produce one kilogram of thrust. Or, more precisely, how many seconds a given propellant, when paired with a given engine, can accelerate its own initial mass at 1 g. The longer it can accelerate its own mass, the more delta-V it delivers to the whole system.

In other words, given a particular engine and a mass of a particular propellant, specific impulse measures for how long a time that engine can exert a continuous force (thrust) until fully burning that mass of propellant. A given mass of a more energy-dense propellant can burn for a longer duration than some less energy-dense propellant made to exert the same force while burning in an engine. Different engine designs burning the same propellant may not be equally efficient at directing their propellant&#x27;s energy into effective thrust. 

For all vehicles, specific impulse (impulse per unit weight-on-Earth of propellant) in seconds can be defined by the following equation:

formula_1

where:

*formula_2 is the thrust obtained from the engine (newtons or pounds force),
*formula_3 is the standard gravity, which is nominally the gravity at Earth&#x27;s surface (m/s2 or ft/s2),
*formula_4 is the specific impulse measured (seconds),
*formula_5 is the mass flow rate of the expended propellant (kg/s or slugs/s)

&quot;I&quot;sp in seconds is the amount of time a rocket engine can generate thrust, given a quantity of propellant whose weight is equal to the engine&#x27;s thrust.

The advantage of this formulation is that it may be used for rockets, where all the reaction mass is carried on board, as well as airplanes, where most of the reaction mass is taken from the atmosphere. In addition, giving the result as a unit of time makes the result easily comparable between calculations in SI units, imperial units, US customary units or other unit framework.

====Imperial units conversion====
The English unit pound mass is more commonly used than the slug, and when using pounds per second for mass flow rate, it is more convenient to express standard gravity as 1 pound-force per pound-mass. Note that this is equivalent to 32.17405 ft/s2, but expressed in more convenient units. This gives:

formula_6

====Rocketry====
In rocketry, the only reaction mass is the propellant, so the specific impulse is calculated using an alternative method, giving results with units of seconds. Specific impulse is defined as the thrust integrated over time per unit weight-on-Earth of the propellant:

formula_7

where

*formula_4 is the specific impulse measured in seconds,
*formula_9 is the average exhaust speed along the axis of the engine (in m/s or ft/s),
*formula_3 is the standard gravity (in m/s2 or ft/s2).

In rockets, due to atmospheric effects, the specific impulse varies with altitude, reaching a maximum in a vacuum. This is because the exhaust velocity is not simply a function of the chamber pressure, but is a function of the difference between the interior and exterior of the combustion chamber. Values are usually given for operation at sea level (&quot;sl&quot;) or in a vacuum (&quot;vac&quot;).

===Specific impulse as effective exhaust velocity===

Because of the geocentric factor of &quot;g&quot;0 in the equation for specific impulse, many prefer an alternative definition. The specific impulse of a rocket can be defined in terms of thrust per unit mass flow of propellant. This is an equally valid (and in some ways somewhat simpler) way of defining the effectiveness of a rocket propellant. For a rocket, the specific impulse defined in this way is simply the effective exhaust velocity relative to the rocket, &quot;v&quot;e. &quot;In actual rocket nozzles, the exhaust velocity is not really uniform over the entire exit cross section and such velocity profiles are difficult to measure accurately. A uniform axial velocity, &quot;v&quot;e, is assumed for all calculations which employ one-dimensional problem descriptions. This effective exhaust velocity represents an average or mass equivalent velocity at which propellant is being ejected from the rocket vehicle.&quot; The two definitions of specific impulse are proportional to one another, and related to each other by:
formula_11
where
*formula_4 is the specific impulse in seconds,
*formula_9 is the specific impulse measured in m/s, which is the same as the effective exhaust velocity measured in m/s (or ft/s if g is in ft/s2),
*formula_3 is the standard gravity, 9.80665 m/s2 (in United States customary units 32.174 ft/s2).

This equation is also valid for air-breathing jet engines, but is rarely used in practice.

(Note that different symbols are sometimes used; for example, &quot;c&quot; is also sometimes seen for exhaust velocity. While the symbol formula_4 might logically be used for specific impulse in units of (N·s)/(m·kg); to avoid confusion, it is desirable to reserve this for specific impulse measured in seconds.)

It is related to the thrust, or forward force on the rocket by the equation:
formula_16
where formula_5 is the propellant mass flow rate, which is the rate of decrease of the vehicle&#x27;s mass.

A rocket must carry all its propellant with it, so the mass of the unburned propellant must be accelerated along with the rocket itself. Minimizing the mass of propellant required to achieve a given change in velocity is crucial to building effective rockets. The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation shows that for a rocket with a given empty mass and a given amount of propellant, the total change in velocity it can accomplish is proportional to the effective exhaust velocity. 

A spacecraft without propulsion follows an orbit determined by its trajectory and any gravitational field. Deviations from the corresponding velocity pattern (these are called Δ&quot;v&quot;) are achieved by sending exhaust mass in the direction opposite to that of the desired velocity change.

===Actual exhaust speed versus effective exhaust speed===

When an engine is run within the atmosphere, the exhaust velocity is reduced by atmospheric pressure, in turn reducing specific impulse. This is a reduction in the effective exhaust velocity, versus the actual exhaust velocity achieved in vacuum conditions. In the case of gas-generator cycle rocket engines, more than one exhaust gas stream is present as turbopump exhaust gas exits through a separate nozzle. Calculating the effective exhaust velocity requires averaging the two mass flows as well as accounting for any atmospheric pressure.

For air-breathing jet engines, particularly turbofans, the actual exhaust velocity and the effective exhaust velocity are different by orders of magnitude. This happens for several reasons. First, a good deal of additional momentum is obtained by using air as reaction mass, such that combustion products in the exhaust have more mass than the burned fuel. Next, inert gases in the atmosphere absorb heat from combustion, and through the resulting expansion provide additional thrust. Lastly, for turbofans and other designs there is even more thrust created by pushing against intake air which never sees combustion directly. These all combine to allow a better match between the airspeed and the exhaust speed, which saves energy/propellant and enormously increases the &quot;effective&quot; exhaust velocity while reducing the &quot;actual&quot; exhaust velocity. Again, this is because the mass of the air is not counted in the specific impulse calculation, thus attributing &quot;all&quot; of the thrust momentum to the mass of the fuel component of the exhaust, and omitting the reaction mass, inert gas, and effect of driven fans on overall engine efficiency from consideration. 

Essentially, the momentum of engine exhaust includes a lot more than just fuel, but specific impulse calculation ignores everything but the fuel. Even though the &quot;effective&quot; exhaust velocity for an air-breathing engine seems nonsensical in the context of actual exhaust velocity, this is still useful for comparing absolute fuel efficiency of different engines.

===Density specific impulse===

A related measure, the density specific impulse, sometimes also referred to as Density Impulse and usually abbreviated as is the product of the average specific gravity of a given propellant mixture and the specific impulse. While less important than the specific impulse, it is an important measure in launch vehicle design, as a low specific impulse implies that bigger tanks will be required to store the propellant, which in turn will have a detrimental effect on the launch vehicle&#x27;s mass ratio.

===Specific fuel consumption===
Specific impulse is inversely proportional to specific fuel consumption (SFC) by the relationship for SFC in kg/(N·s) and for SFC in lb/(lbf·hr).

==Examples==


An example of a specific impulse measured in time is 453 seconds, which is equivalent to an effective exhaust velocity of , for the RS-25 engines when operating in a vacuum. An air-breathing jet engine typically has a much larger specific impulse than a rocket; for example a turbofan jet engine may have a specific impulse of 6,000 seconds or more at sea level whereas a rocket would be between 200 and 400 seconds.

An air-breathing engine is thus much more propellant efficient than a rocket engine, because the air serves as reaction mass and oxidizer for combustion which does not have to be carried as propellant, and the actual exhaust speed is much lower, so the kinetic energy the exhaust carries away is lower and thus the jet engine uses far less energy to generate thrust. While the &quot;actual&quot; exhaust velocity is lower for air-breathing engines, the &quot;effective&quot; exhaust velocity is very high for jet engines. This is because the effective exhaust velocity calculation assumes that the carried propellant is providing all the reaction mass and all the thrust. Hence effective exhaust velocity is not physically meaningful for air-breathing engines; nevertheless, it is useful for comparison with other types of engines.

The highest specific impulse for a chemical propellant ever test-fired in a rocket engine was with a tripropellant of lithium, fluorine, and hydrogen. However, this combination is impractical. Lithium and fluorine are both extremely corrosive, lithium ignites on contact with air, fluorine ignites on contact with most fuels, and hydrogen, while not hypergolic, is an explosive hazard. Fluorine and the hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the exhaust are very toxic, which damages the environment, makes work around the launch pad difficult, and makes getting a launch license that much more difficult. The rocket exhaust is also ionized, which would interfere with radio communication with the rocket.

Nuclear thermal rocket engines differ from conventional rocket engines in that energy is supplied to the propellants by an external nuclear heat source instead of the heat of combustion. The nuclear rocket typically operates by passing liquid hydrogen gas through an operating nuclear reactor. Testing in the 1960s yielded specific impulses of about 850 seconds (8,340 m/s), about twice that of the Space Shuttle engines.

A variety of other rocket propulsion methods, such as ion thrusters, give much higher specific impulse but with much lower thrust; for example the Hall-effect thruster on the SMART-1 satellite has a specific impulse of but a maximum thrust of only . The variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket (VASIMR) engine currently in development will theoretically yield , and a maximum thrust of .

<text>Rowrbrazzle is an Amateur Press Association magazine devoted to funny animal cartoon illustration.

==History==
&quot;Rowrbrazzle&quot; was founded in 1983 by Marc Schirmeister, who published the first issue in February 1984, and was editor for the first nineteen quarterly mailings. Fred Patten was then editor from January 1989 (Issue 20) through January 2005 until suffering a stroke and retiring after Issue 84. Edd Vick became Official Editor from April 2005 (Issue 85) to April 2007 (Issue 93), William Earl Haskell became Official Editor from Issue 94 (July 2007) to January 2016 (Issue 128) when he was forced to retire due to poor health, and Edd Vick became Official Editor again from April 2016 (Issue 129).

The first &quot;Rowrbrazzle&quot; was distributed to the association membership in February 1984.

Landmark issue number 150 was distributed in July 2021, in a continuing uninterrupted run of 37 1/2 years.

==Significance==
Fred Patten, onetime editor of &quot;Rowrbrazzle&quot;, had this view of &quot;Rowrbrazzle&quot;&#x27;s significance:
:&quot;My thesis is that furry fandom coalesced out of sf fandom and comics fandom, blending elements from both of them and achieving its own critical mass in 1983/1984. The first clear signs of the independent furry fandom were the creation of its first APA, Rowrbrazzle, and the decision by some fans to self-publish furry comic books because there seemed to be enough fans of stories with talking animals to support them (as distinct from earlier attempts to self-publish comics which had to hope for sufficient sales from the public alone.)
:&quot;Rowrbrazzle started in February 1984. Since it was specifically an APA for writing and drawing funny animals as a genre and discussing the new fandom that was forming about them, it is a handy landmark to say that &#x27;furry fandom existed at this time.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="40253" wikidata="Q520667" url="?curid=40253" title="Precognition">
<text>Precognition (from the Latin &#x27;before&#x27;, and &#x27;acquiring knowledge&#x27;) is the purported psychic phenomenon of seeing, or otherwise becoming directly aware of, events in the future.

There is no accepted scientific evidence that precognition is a real effect, and it is widely considered to be pseudoscience. Precognition violates the principle of causality, that an effect cannot occur before its cause.

Precognition has been widely believed in throughout history. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, many people believe it to be real; it is still widely reported and remains a topic of research and discussion within the parapsychology community.

==Precognitive phenomena==
Precognition is sometimes treated as an example of the wider phenomenon of prescience or foreknowledge, to understand by any means what is likely to happen in the future. It is distinct from premonition, which is a vaguer feeling of some impending disaster. Related activities such as predictive prophecy and fortune telling have been practised throughout history.

Precognitive dreams are the most widely reported occurrences of precognition. Usually, a dream or vision can only be identified as precognitive after the putative event has taken place. When such an event occurs after a dream, it is said to have &quot;broken the dream&quot;.

=== In religion ===
In Judaism it is believed that dreams are mostly insignificant while others &quot;have the potential to contain prophetic messages&quot;. Others hold that dreams have meaning, and bad dreams require amelioration. According to the Book of Genesis, God granted Joseph precognition through prophetic dreams and the ability to interpret the dreams of others.

Precognition has a role in Buddhism with dreams believed to be &#x27;mind-created phenomena&#x27;. Those dreams which &#x27;warn of impending danger or even prepare us for overwhelming good news&quot; are considered the most important.

==History==
Throughout history it has been believed that certain individuals have precognitive abilities, or that certain practices can induce such experiences, and these visions have sometimes been associated with important historical events. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, many people still believe in precognition. A poll in 2005 showed 73% of Americans believe in at least one type of paranormal experience, with 41% believing in extrasensory perception.

===Antiquity===
Since ancient times precognition has been associated with dreams and trance states as well as waking premonitions, giving rise to acts of prophecy and fortune telling. Oracles, originally seen as sources of wisdom, became progressively associated with previsions of the future.

Such claims of seeing the future have never been without their sceptical critics. Aristotle carried out an inquiry into allegedly prophetic dreams in his &quot;On Divination in Sleep&quot;. He accepted that &quot;it is quite conceivable that some dreams may be tokens and causes [of future events]&quot; but also believed that &quot;most [so-called prophetic] dreams are, however, to be classed as mere coincidences...&quot;. Where Democritus had suggested that emanations from future events could be sent back to the dreamer, Aristotle proposed that it was, rather, the dreamer&#x27;s sense impressions which reached forward to the event.

===17th–19th centuries===
The term &quot;precognition&quot; first appeared in the 17th century but did not come into common use among investigators until much later.

An early investigation into claims of precognition was published by the missionary Fr. P. Boilat in 1883. He claimed to have put an unspoken question to an African witch-doctor whom he mistrusted. Contrary to his expectations, the witch-doctor gave him the correct answer without ever having heard the question.

===Early 20th century===
In the early 20th century J. W. Dunne, a British soldier and aeronautics engineer, experienced several dreams which he regarded as precognitive. He developed techniques to record and analyse them, identifying any correspondences between his future experiences and his recorded dreams. He reported his findings in his 1927 book &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot;. In it he alleges that 10% of his dreams appeared to include some element of future experience. He also persuaded some friends to try the experiment on themselves, with mixed results. He noted a strong cognitive bias in which subjects, including himself, were reluctant to ascribe their dream correspondences to precognition and determinedly sought alternative explanations. Dunne concluded that precognitive elements in dreams are common and that many people unknowingly have them. He suggested also that dream precognition did not reference future events of all kinds, but specifically the future experiences of the dreamer. He was led to this idea when he found that a dream of a volcanic eruption appeared to foresee not the disaster itself but his subsequent misreading of an inaccurate account in a newspaper. 

Edith Lyttelton, who became President of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), regarded his theory as consistent with her own idea of the superconscious. In 1932 he helped the SPR to conduct a more formal experiment, but he and the Society&#x27;s lead researcher Theodore Besterman failed to agree on the significance of the results. Nevertheless, the Philosopher C. D. Broad remarked that, &quot;The only theory known to me which seems worth consideration is that proposed by Mr. Dunne in his Experiment with Time.&quot; &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot; was widely read and &quot;undoubtedly helped to form something of the imaginative climate of [the interwar] years&quot;, influencing many writers of both fact and fiction both then and since. According to Flieger, &quot;Dunne&#x27;s theory was so current and popular a topic that not to understand it was a mark of singularity.&quot; Major writers whose work was significantly influenced by his ideas on precognition in dreams and visions include H. G. Wells, J. B. Priestley and Olaf Stapledon. Vladimir Nabokov was also later influenced by Dunne.

In 1932 Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s infant son was kidnapped, murdered and buried among trees. Psychologists Henry Murray and D. R. Wheeler used the event to test for dream precognition, by inviting the public to report any dreams of the child. A total of 1,300 dreams were reported. Only five per cent envisioned the child dead and only 4 of the 1,300 envisioned the location of the grave as amongst trees.

The first ongoing and organised research program on precognition was instituted by husband-and-wife team Joseph Banks Rhine and Louisa E. Rhine in the 1930s at Duke University&#x27;s Parapsychology Laboratory. J. B. Rhine used a method of forced-choice matching in which participants guessed the order of a deck of 25 cards, each five of which bore one of five geometrical symbols. Although his results were positive and gained some academic acceptance, his methods were later shown to be badly flawed and subsequent researchers using more rigorous procedures were unable to reproduce his results. His mathematics was sometimes flawed, the experiments were not double-blinded or even necessarily single-blinded and some of the cards to be guessed were so thin that the symbol could be seen through the backing.

Samuel G. Soal, another leading member of the SPR, was described by Rhine as one of his harshest critics, running many similar experiments with wholly negative results. However, from around 1940 he ran forced-choice ESP experiments in which a subject attempted to identify which of five animal pictures a subject in another room was looking at. Their performance on this task was at chance, but when the scores were matched with the card that came &quot;after&quot; the target card, three of the thirteen subjects showed a very high hit rate; Rhine now described Soal&#x27;s work as &quot;a milestone in the field&quot;. However analyses of Soal&#x27;s findings, conducted several years later, concluded that the positive results were more likely the result of deliberate fraud. The controversy continued for many years more. In 1978 the statistician and parapsychology researcher Betty Markwick, while seeking to vindicate Soal, discovered that he had tampered with his data. The untainted experimental results showed no evidence of precognition.

===Late 20th century===
As more modern technology became available, more automated techniques of experimentation were developed that did not rely on hand-scoring of equivalence between targets and guesses, and in which the targets could be more reliably and readily tested at random. In 1969 Helmut Schmidt introduced the use of high-speed random event generators (REG) for precognition testing, and experiments were also conducted at the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab. Once again, flaws were found in all of Schmidt&#x27;s experiments, when the psychologist C. E. M. Hansel found that several necessary precautions were not taken.

SF writer Philip K Dick believed that he had precognitive experiences and used the idea in some of his novels, especially as a central plot element in his 1956 science fiction short story &quot;The Minority Report&quot; and in his 1956 novel &quot;The World Jones Made&quot;.

In 1963 the BBC television programme &quot;Monitor&quot; broadcast an appeal by the writer J.B. Priestley for experiences which challenged our understanding of Time. He received hundreds of letters in reply and believed that many of them described genuine precognitive dreams. In 2014 the BBC Radio 4 broadcaster Francis Spufford revisited Priestley&#x27;s work and its relation to the ideas of J.W. Dunne.

In 1965 G. W. Lambert, a former Council member of the SPR, proposed five criteria that needed to be met before an account of a precognitive dream could be regarded as credible:
#The dream should be reported to a credible witness before the event.
#The time interval between the dream and the event should be short.
#The event should be unexpected at the time of the dream.
#The description should be of an event destined literally, and not symbolically, to happen.
#The details of dream and event should tally.

David Ryback, a psychologist in Atlanta, used a questionnaire survey approach to investigate precognitive dreaming in college students during the 1980s. His survey of over 433 participants showed that 290 or 66.9 per cent reported some form of paranormal dream. He rejected many of these reports, but claimed that 8.8 per cent of the population was having actual precognitive dreams.

===21st century===
In 2011 the psychologist Daryl Bem, a Professor Emeritus at Cornell University, published findings showing statistical evidence for precognition in the &quot;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&quot;. The paper was heavily criticised, and the criticism widened to include the journal itself and the validity of the peer-review process. In 2012, an independent attempt to reproduce Bem&#x27;s results was published, but it failed to do so. The widespread controversy led to calls for improvements in practice and for more research.

==Scientific reception==
Claims of precognition are, like any other claims, open to scientific criticism. However, the nature of the criticism must adapt to the nature of the claim.

===Pseudoscience===
Claims of precognition are criticised on three main grounds:
*There is no known scientific mechanism which would allow precognition. It breaks temporal causality, in that the precognised event causes an effect in the subject prior to the event itself.
*The large body of experimental work has produced no accepted scientific evidence that precognition exists.
*The large body of anecdotal evidence can be explained by alternative psychological mechanisms.
Consequently, precognition is widely considered to be pseudoscience.

===Violation of causality===
Precognition would violate the principle of antecedence (causality); that is, that an effect does not happen before its cause. Information passing backwards in time (retrocausality) would need to be carried by physical particles doing the same. Experimental evidence from high-energy physics suggests that this cannot happen. There is therefore no direct justification for precognition from a physics-based approach.

Precognition would also contradict &quot;most of the neuroscience and psychology literature, from electrophysiology and neuroimaging to temporal effects found in psychophysical research.&quot;

===Lack of evidence===
A great deal of evidence for precognition has been put forward, both as witnessed anecdotes and as experimental results, but none has been accepted as rigorous scientific proof of the phenomenon. Even the most prominent pieces of evidence have been repeatedly rejected due to errors in those experiments as well as follow-on studies contradicting the original evidence. This suggests that the evidence was not valid in the first place.

===Alternative explanations===
Various known psychological processes have been put forward to explain experiences of apparent precognition. These include:

* Coincidence, where apparent instances of precognition in fact arise from the law of truly large numbers.
* Self-fulfilling prophecy and unconscious enactment, where people unconsciously bring about events which they have previously imagined.
* Unconscious perception, where people unconsciously infer, from data they have unconsciously learned, that a certain event will probably happen in a certain context. When the event occurs, the former knowledge appears to have been acquired without the aid of recognised channels of information.
* Retrofitting, which involves the false interpretation of a past record of a dream or vision, in order to match it to a recent event. Retrofitting provides an explanation for the supposed accuracy of Nostradamus&#x27;s vague predictions. For example, quatrain I:60 states &quot;A ruler born near Italy...He&#x27;s less a prince than a butcher.&quot; The phrase &quot;near Italy&quot; can be construed as covering a very broad range of geography, while no details are provided by Nostradamus regarding the era when this ruler will live. Because of this vagueness, and the flexibility of retrofitting, this quatrain has been interpreted by some as referring to Napoleon, but by others as referring to the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II, and by others still as a reference to Hitler.
*False memories, such as identifying paramnesia and memory biases, where the memory of a non-existent precognitive event is formed after the real event has occurred. Where subjects in a dream experiment have been asked to write down their dreams in a diary, this can prevent selective memory effects such that the dreams no longer seem accurate about the future. 
* Déjà vu, where people experience a false feeling that an identical event has occurred previously. Some recent authors have suggested that déjà vu and identifying paramnesia are the same thing. This view is not universally held, with others instead treating them as distinct phenomena.

Psychological explanations have also been proposed for belief in precognition. Psychologists have conducted experiments which are claimed to show that people who feel loss of control in their lives will turn to belief in precognition, because it gives them a sense of regaining control.

<text>In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems via biologically inspired operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation. Some examples of GA applications include optimizing decision trees for better performance, solving sudoku puzzles, hyperparameter optimization, and causal inference.

== Methodology ==

=== Optimization problems ===
In a genetic algorithm, a population of candidate solutions (called individuals, creatures, organisms, or phenotypes) to an optimization problem is evolved toward better solutions. Each candidate solution has a set of properties (its chromosomes or genotype) which can be mutated and altered; traditionally, solutions are represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s, but other encodings are also possible.

The evolution usually starts from a population of randomly generated individuals, and is an iterative process, with the population in each iteration called a &quot;generation&quot;. In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated; the fitness is usually the value of the objective function in the optimization problem being solved. The more fit individuals are stochastically selected from the current population, and each individual&#x27;s genome is modified (recombined and possibly randomly mutated) to form a new generation. The new generation of candidate solutions is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm. Commonly, the algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced, or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population.

A typical genetic algorithm requires:

# a genetic representation of the solution domain,
# a fitness function to evaluate the solution domain.

A standard representation of each candidate solution is as an array of bits (also called &quot;bit set&quot; or &quot;bit string&quot;). Arrays of other types and structures can be used in essentially the same way. The main property that makes these genetic representations convenient is that their parts are easily aligned due to their fixed size, which facilitates simple crossover operations. Variable length representations may also be used, but crossover implementation is more complex in this case. Tree-like representations are explored in genetic programming and graph-form representations are explored in evolutionary programming; a mix of both linear chromosomes and trees is explored in gene expression programming.

Once the genetic representation and the fitness function are defined, a GA proceeds to initialize a population of solutions and then to improve it through repetitive application of the mutation, crossover, inversion and selection operators.

==== Initialization ====
The population size depends on the nature of the problem, but typically contains hundreds or thousands of possible solutions. Often, the initial population is generated randomly, allowing the entire range of possible solutions (the search space). Occasionally, the solutions may be &quot;seeded&quot; in areas where optimal solutions are likely to be found or the distribution of the sampling probability tuned to focus in those areas of greater interest.

==== Selection ====

During each successive generation, a portion of the existing population is selected to reproduce for a new generation. Individual solutions are selected through a &quot;fitness-based&quot; process, where fitter solutions (as measured by a fitness function) are typically more likely to be selected. Certain selection methods rate the fitness of each solution and preferentially select the best solutions. Other methods rate only a random sample of the population, as the former process may be very time-consuming.

The fitness function is defined over the genetic representation and measures the &quot;quality&quot; of the represented solution. The fitness function is always problem-dependent. For instance, in the knapsack problem one wants to maximize the total value of objects that can be put in a knapsack of some fixed capacity. A representation of a solution might be an array of bits, where each bit represents a different object, and the value of the bit (0 or 1) represents whether or not the object is in the knapsack. Not every such representation is valid, as the size of objects may exceed the capacity of the knapsack. The &quot;fitness&quot; of the solution is the sum of values of all objects in the knapsack if the representation is valid, or 0 otherwise.

In some problems, it is hard or even impossible to define the fitness expression; in these cases, a simulation may be used to determine the fitness function value of a phenotype (e.g. computational fluid dynamics is used to determine the air resistance of a vehicle whose shape is encoded as the phenotype), or even interactive genetic algorithms are used.

==== Genetic operators ====
The next step is to generate a second generation population of solutions from those selected, through a combination of genetic operators: crossover (also called recombination), and mutation.

For each new solution to be produced, a pair of &quot;parent&quot; solutions is selected for breeding from the pool selected previously. By producing a &quot;child&quot; solution using the above methods of crossover and mutation, a new solution is created which typically shares many of the characteristics of its &quot;parents&quot;. New parents are selected for each new child, and the process continues until a new population of solutions of appropriate size is generated.
Although reproduction methods that are based on the use of two parents are more &quot;biology inspired&quot;, some research suggests that more than two &quot;parents&quot; generate higher quality chromosomes.

These processes ultimately result in the next generation population of chromosomes that is different from the initial generation. Generally, the average fitness will have increased by this procedure for the population, since only the best organisms from the first generation are selected for breeding, along with a small proportion of less fit solutions. These less fit solutions ensure genetic diversity within the genetic pool of the parents and therefore ensure the genetic diversity of the subsequent generation of children.

Opinion is divided over the importance of crossover versus mutation. There are many references in Fogel (2006) that support the importance of mutation-based search.

Although crossover and mutation are known as the main genetic operators, it is possible to use other operators such as regrouping, colonization-extinction, or migration in genetic algorithms.

It is worth tuning parameters such as the mutation probability, crossover probability and population size to find reasonable settings for the problem class being worked on. A very small mutation rate may lead to genetic drift (which is non-ergodic in nature). A recombination rate that is too high may lead to premature convergence of the genetic algorithm. A mutation rate that is too high may lead to loss of good solutions, unless elitist selection is employed. An adequate population size ensures sufficient genetic diversity for the problem at hand, but can lead to a waste of computational resources if set to a value larger than required.

==== Heuristics ====

In addition to the main operators above, other heuristics may be employed to make the calculation faster or more robust. The &quot;speciation&quot; heuristic penalizes crossover between candidate solutions that are too similar; this encourages population diversity and helps prevent premature convergence to a less optimal solution.

==== Termination ====
This generational process is repeated until a termination condition has been reached. Common terminating conditions are:

* A solution is found that satisfies minimum criteria
* Fixed number of generations reached
* Allocated budget (computation time/money) reached
* The highest ranking solution&#x27;s fitness is reaching or has reached a plateau such that successive iterations no longer produce better results
* Manual inspection
* Combinations of the above

== The building block hypothesis ==
Genetic algorithms are simple to implement, but their behavior is difficult to understand. In particular, it is difficult to understand why these algorithms frequently succeed at generating solutions of high fitness when applied to practical problems. The building block hypothesis (BBH) consists of:

# A description of a heuristic that performs adaptation by identifying and recombining &quot;building blocks&quot;, i.e. low order, low defining-length schemata with above average fitness.
# A hypothesis that a genetic algorithm performs adaptation by implicitly and efficiently implementing this heuristic.

Goldberg describes the heuristic as follows:

:&quot;Short, low order, and highly fit schemata are sampled, recombined [crossed over], and resampled to form strings of potentially higher fitness. In a way, by working with these particular schemata [the building blocks], we have reduced the complexity of our problem; instead of building high-performance strings by trying every conceivable combination, we construct better and better strings from the best partial solutions of past samplings.

:&quot;Because highly fit schemata of low defining length and low order play such an important role in the action of genetic algorithms, we have already given them a special name: building blocks. Just as a child creates magnificent fortresses through the arrangement of simple blocks of wood, so does a genetic algorithm seek near optimal performance through the juxtaposition of short, low-order, high-performance schemata, or building blocks.&quot;

Despite the lack of consensus regarding the validity of the building-block hypothesis, it has been consistently evaluated and used as reference throughout the years. Many estimation of distribution algorithms, for example, have been proposed in an attempt to provide an environment in which the hypothesis would hold. Although good results have been reported for some classes of problems, skepticism concerning the generality and/or practicality of the building-block hypothesis as an explanation for GAs&#x27; efficiency still remains. Indeed, there is a reasonable amount of work that attempts to understand its limitations from the perspective of estimation of distribution algorithms.

== Limitations ==

The practical use of a genetic algorithm has limitations, especially as compared to alternative optimization algorithms:

* Repeated fitness function evaluation for complex problems is often the most prohibitive and limiting segment of artificial evolutionary algorithms. Finding the optimal solution to complex high-dimensional, multimodal problems often requires very expensive fitness function evaluations. In real world problems such as structural optimization problems, a single function evaluation may require several hours to several days of complete simulation. Typical optimization methods cannot deal with such types of problem. In this case, it may be necessary to forgo an exact evaluation and use an approximated fitness that is computationally efficient. It is apparent that amalgamation of approximate models may be one of the most promising approaches to convincingly use GA to solve complex real life problems.
* Genetic algorithms do not scale well with complexity. That is, where the number of elements which are exposed to mutation is large there is often an exponential increase in search space size. This makes it extremely difficult to use the technique on problems such as designing an engine, a house or a plane . In order to make such problems tractable to evolutionary search, they must be broken down into the simplest representation possible. Hence we typically see evolutionary algorithms encoding designs for fan blades instead of engines, building shapes instead of detailed construction plans, and airfoils instead of whole aircraft designs. The second problem of complexity is the issue of how to protect parts that have evolved to represent good solutions from further destructive mutation, particularly when their fitness assessment requires them to combine well with other parts.
* The &quot;better&quot; solution is only in comparison to other solutions. As a result, the stopping criterion is not clear in every problem.
* In many problems, GAs have a tendency to converge towards local optima or even arbitrary points rather than the global optimum of the problem. This means that it does not &quot;know how&quot; to sacrifice short-term fitness to gain longer-term fitness. The likelihood of this occurring depends on the shape of the fitness landscape: certain problems may provide an easy ascent towards a global optimum, others may make it easier for the function to find the local optima. This problem may be alleviated by using a different fitness function, increasing the rate of mutation, or by using selection techniques that maintain a diverse population of solutions, although the No Free Lunch theorem proves that there is no general solution to this problem. A common technique to maintain diversity is to impose a &quot;niche penalty&quot;, wherein, any group of individuals of sufficient similarity (niche radius) have a penalty added, which will reduce the representation of that group in subsequent generations, permitting other (less similar) individuals to be maintained in the population. This trick, however, may not be effective, depending on the landscape of the problem. Another possible technique would be to simply replace part of the population with randomly generated individuals, when most of the population is too similar to each other. Diversity is important in genetic algorithms (and genetic programming) because crossing over a homogeneous population does not yield new solutions. In evolution strategies and evolutionary programming, diversity is not essential because of a greater reliance on mutation.
* Operating on dynamic data sets is difficult, as genomes begin to converge early on towards solutions which may no longer be valid for later data. Several methods have been proposed to remedy this by increasing genetic diversity somehow and preventing early convergence, either by increasing the probability of mutation when the solution quality drops (called &quot;triggered hypermutation&quot;), or by occasionally introducing entirely new, randomly generated elements into the gene pool (called &quot;random immigrants&quot;). Again, evolution strategies and evolutionary programming can be implemented with a so-called &quot;comma strategy&quot; in which parents are not maintained and new parents are selected only from offspring. This can be more effective on dynamic problems.
* GAs cannot effectively solve problems in which the only fitness measure is a binary pass/fail outcome (like decision problems), as there is no way to converge on the solution (no hill to climb). In these cases, a random search may find a solution as quickly as a GA. However, if the situation allows the success/failure trial to be repeated giving (possibly) different results, then the ratio of successes to failures provides a suitable fitness measure.
* For specific optimization problems and problem instances, other optimization algorithms may be more efficient than genetic algorithms in terms of speed of convergence. Alternative and complementary algorithms include evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, simulated annealing, Gaussian adaptation, hill climbing, and swarm intelligence (e.g.: ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization) and methods based on integer linear programming. The suitability of genetic algorithms is dependent on the amount of knowledge of the problem; well known problems often have better, more specialized approaches.

== Variants ==

=== Chromosome representation ===

The simplest algorithm represents each chromosome as a bit string. Typically, numeric parameters can be represented by integers, though it is possible to use floating point representations. The floating point representation is natural to evolution strategies and evolutionary programming. The notion of real-valued genetic algorithms has been offered but is really a misnomer because it does not really represent the building block theory that was proposed by John Henry Holland in the 1970s. This theory is not without support though, based on theoretical and experimental results (see below). The basic algorithm performs crossover and mutation at the bit level. Other variants treat the chromosome as a list of numbers which are indexes into an instruction table, nodes in a linked list, hashes, objects, or any other imaginable data structure. Crossover and mutation are performed so as to respect data element boundaries. For most data types, specific variation operators can be designed. Different chromosomal data types seem to work better or worse for different specific problem domains.

When bit-string representations of integers are used, Gray coding is often employed. In this way, small changes in the integer can be readily affected through mutations or crossovers. This has been found to help prevent premature convergence at so-called &quot;Hamming walls&quot;, in which too many simultaneous mutations (or crossover events) must occur in order to change the chromosome to a better solution.

Other approaches involve using arrays of real-valued numbers instead of bit strings to represent chromosomes. Results from the theory of schemata suggest that in general the smaller the alphabet, the better the performance, but it was initially surprising to researchers that good results were obtained from using real-valued chromosomes. This was explained as the set of real values in a finite population of chromosomes as forming a &quot;virtual alphabet&quot; (when selection and recombination are dominant) with a much lower cardinality than would be expected from a floating point representation.

An expansion of the Genetic Algorithm accessible problem domain can be obtained through more complex encoding of the solution pools by concatenating several types of heterogenously encoded genes into one chromosome. This particular approach allows for solving optimization problems that require vastly disparate definition domains for the problem parameters. For instance, in problems of cascaded controller tuning, the internal loop controller structure can belong to a conventional regulator of three parameters, whereas the external loop could implement a linguistic controller (such as a fuzzy system) which has an inherently different description. This particular form of encoding requires a specialized crossover mechanism that recombines the chromosome by section, and it is a useful tool for the modelling and simulation of complex adaptive systems, especially evolution processes.

=== Elitism ===
A practical variant of the general process of constructing a new population is to allow the best organism(s) from the current generation to carry over to the next, unaltered. This strategy is known as &quot;elitist selection&quot; and guarantees that the solution quality obtained by the GA will not decrease from one generation to the next.

=== Parallel implementations ===
Parallel implementations of genetic algorithms come in two flavors. Coarse-grained parallel genetic algorithms assume a population on each of the computer nodes and migration of individuals among the nodes. Fine-grained parallel genetic algorithms assume an individual on each processor node which acts with neighboring individuals for selection and reproduction.
Other variants, like genetic algorithms for online optimization problems, introduce time-dependence or noise in the fitness function.

=== Adaptive GAs ===
Genetic algorithms with adaptive parameters (adaptive genetic algorithms, AGAs) is another significant and promising variant of genetic algorithms. The probabilities of crossover (pc) and mutation (pm) greatly determine the degree of solution accuracy and the convergence speed that genetic algorithms can obtain. Researchers have analyzed GA convergence analytically.

Instead of using fixed values of &quot;pc&quot; and &quot;pm&quot;, AGAs utilize the population information in each generation and adaptively adjust the &quot;pc&quot; and &quot;pm&quot; in order to maintain the population diversity as well as to sustain the convergence capacity. In AGA (adaptive genetic algorithm), the adjustment of &quot;pc&quot; and &quot;pm&quot; depends on the fitness values of the solutions. There are more examples of AGA variants: Successive zooming method is an early example of improving convergence. In &quot;CAGA&quot; (clustering-based adaptive genetic algorithm), through the use of clustering analysis to judge the optimization states of the population, the adjustment of &quot;pc&quot; and &quot;pm&quot; depends on these optimization states. Recent approaches use more abstract variables for deciding &quot;pc&quot; and &quot;pm&quot;. Examples are dominance &amp; co-dominance principles and LIGA (levelized interpolative genetic algorithm), which combines a flexible GA with modified A* search to tackle search space anisotropicity.

It can be quite effective to combine GA with other optimization methods. A GA tends to be quite good at finding generally good global solutions, but quite inefficient at finding the last few mutations to find the absolute optimum. Other techniques (such as simple hill climbing) are quite efficient at finding absolute optimum in a limited region. Alternating GA and hill climbing can improve the efficiency of GA while overcoming the lack of robustness of hill climbing.

This means that the rules of genetic variation may have a different meaning in the natural case. For instance – provided that steps are stored in consecutive order – crossing over may sum a number of steps from maternal DNA adding a number of steps from paternal DNA and so on. This is like adding vectors that more probably may follow a ridge in the phenotypic landscape. Thus, the efficiency of the process may be increased by many orders of magnitude. Moreover, the inversion operator has the opportunity to place steps in consecutive order or any other suitable order in favour of survival or efficiency.

A variation, where the population as a whole is evolved rather than its individual members, is known as gene pool recombination.

A number of variations have been developed to attempt to improve performance of GAs on problems with a high degree of fitness epistasis, i.e. where the fitness of a solution consists of interacting subsets of its variables. Such algorithms aim to learn (before exploiting) these beneficial phenotypic interactions. As such, they are aligned with the Building Block Hypothesis in adaptively reducing disruptive recombination. Prominent examples of this approach include the mGA, GEMGA and LLGA.

== Problem domains ==
Problems which appear to be particularly appropriate for solution by genetic algorithms include timetabling and scheduling problems, and many scheduling software packages are based on GAs. GAs have also been applied to engineering. Genetic algorithms are often applied as an approach to solve global optimization problems.

As a general rule of thumb genetic algorithms might be useful in problem domains that have a complex fitness landscape as mixing, i.e., mutation in combination with crossover, is designed to move the population away from local optima that a traditional hill climbing algorithm might get stuck in. Observe that commonly used crossover operators cannot change any uniform population. Mutation alone can provide ergodicity of the overall genetic algorithm process (seen as a Markov chain).

Examples of problems solved by genetic algorithms include: mirrors designed to funnel sunlight to a solar collector, antennae designed to pick up radio signals in space, walking methods for computer figures, optimal design of aerodynamic bodies in complex flowfields

In his &quot;Algorithm Design Manual&quot;, Skiena advises against genetic algorithms for any task:

== History ==
In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a &quot;learning machine&quot; which would parallel the principles of evolution. Computer simulation of evolution started as early as in 1954 with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli, who was using the computer at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. His 1954 publication was not widely noticed. Starting in 1957, the Australian quantitative geneticist Alex Fraser published a series of papers on simulation of artificial selection of organisms with multiple loci controlling a measurable trait. From these beginnings, computer simulation of evolution by biologists became more common in the early 1960s, and the methods were described in books by Fraser and Burnell (1970) and Crosby (1973). Fraser&#x27;s simulations included all of the essential elements of modern genetic algorithms. In addition, Hans-Joachim Bremermann published a series of papers in the 1960s that also adopted a population of solution to optimization problems, undergoing recombination, mutation, and selection. Bremermann&#x27;s research also included the elements of modern genetic algorithms. Other noteworthy early pioneers include Richard Friedberg, George Friedman, and Michael Conrad. Many early papers are reprinted by Fogel (1998).

Although Barricelli, in work he reported in 1963, had simulated the evolution of ability to play a simple game, artificial evolution only became a widely recognized optimization method as a result of the work of Ingo Rechenberg and Hans-Paul Schwefel in the 1960s and early 1970s – Rechenberg&#x27;s group was able to solve complex engineering problems through evolution strategies. Another approach was the evolutionary programming technique of Lawrence J. Fogel, which was proposed for generating artificial intelligence. Evolutionary programming originally used finite state machines for predicting environments, and used variation and selection to optimize the predictive logics. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the work of John Holland in the early 1970s, and particularly his book &quot;Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems&quot; (1975). His work originated with studies of cellular automata, conducted by Holland and his students at the University of Michigan. Holland introduced a formalized framework for predicting the quality of the next generation, known as Holland&#x27;s Schema Theorem. Research in GAs remained largely theoretical until the mid-1980s, when The First International Conference on Genetic Algorithms was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

===Commercial products===
In the late 1980s, General Electric started selling the world&#x27;s first genetic algorithm product, a mainframe-based toolkit designed for industrial processes. 
In 1989, Axcelis, Inc. released Evolver, the world&#x27;s first commercial GA product for desktop computers. The New York Times technology writer John Markoff wrote about Evolver in 1990, and it remained the only interactive commercial genetic algorithm until 1995. Evolver was sold to Palisade in 1997, translated into several languages, and is currently in its 6th version. Since the 1990s, MATLAB has built in three derivative-free optimization heuristic algorithms (simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm) and two direct search algorithms (simplex search, pattern search).

===Related fields===

====Evolutionary algorithms====
Evolutionary algorithms is a sub-field of evolutionary computing.

* Evolution strategies (ES, see Rechenberg, 1994) evolve individuals by means of mutation and intermediate or discrete recombination. ES algorithms are designed particularly to solve problems in the real-value domain. They use self-adaptation to adjust control parameters of the search. De-randomization of self-adaptation has led to the contemporary Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES).
* Evolutionary programming (EP) involves populations of solutions with primarily mutation and selection and arbitrary representations. They use self-adaptation to adjust parameters, and can include other variation operations such as combining information from multiple parents.
* Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) substitutes traditional reproduction operators by model-guided operators. Such models are learned from the population by employing machine learning techniques and represented as Probabilistic Graphical Models, from which new solutions can be sampled or generated from guided-crossover.
* Genetic programming (GP) is a related technique popularized by John Koza in which computer programs, rather than function parameters, are optimized. Genetic programming often uses tree-based internal data structures to represent the computer programs for adaptation instead of the list structures typical of genetic algorithms. There are many variants of Genetic Programming, including Cartesian genetic programming, Gene expression programming, grammatical evolution, Linear genetic programming, Multi expression programming etc.
* Grouping genetic algorithm (GGA) is an evolution of the GA where the focus is shifted from individual items, like in classical GAs, to groups or subset of items. The idea behind this GA evolution proposed by Emanuel Falkenauer is that solving some complex problems, a.k.a. &quot;clustering&quot; or &quot;partitioning&quot; problems where a set of items must be split into disjoint group of items in an optimal way, would better be achieved by making characteristics of the groups of items equivalent to genes. These kind of problems include bin packing, line balancing, clustering with respect to a distance measure, equal piles, etc., on which classic GAs proved to perform poorly. Making genes equivalent to groups implies chromosomes that are in general of variable length, and special genetic operators that manipulate whole groups of items. For bin packing in particular, a GGA hybridized with the Dominance Criterion of Martello and Toth, is arguably the best technique to date.
* Interactive evolutionary algorithms are evolutionary algorithms that use human evaluation. They are usually applied to domains where it is hard to design a computational fitness function, for example, evolving images, music, artistic designs and forms to fit users&#x27; aesthetic preference.

====Swarm intelligence====

Swarm intelligence is a sub-field of evolutionary computing.

* Ant colony optimization (ACO) uses many ants (or agents) equipped with a pheromone model to traverse the solution space and find locally productive areas. 
*Although considered an Estimation of distribution algorithm, Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method for multi-parameter optimization which also uses population-based approach. A population (swarm) of candidate solutions (particles) moves in the search space, and the movement of the particles is influenced both by their own best known position and swarm&#x27;s global best known position. Like genetic algorithms, the PSO method depends on information sharing among population members. In some problems the PSO is often more computationally efficient than the GAs, especially in unconstrained problems with continuous variables.

====Other evolutionary computing algorithms====

Evolutionary computation is a sub-field of the metaheuristic methods.

* Memetic algorithm (MA), often called &quot;hybrid genetic algorithm&quot; among others, is a population-based method in which solutions are also subject to local improvement phases. The idea of memetic algorithms comes from memes, which unlike genes, can adapt themselves. In some problem areas they are shown to be more efficient than traditional evolutionary algorithms.
* Bacteriologic algorithms (BA) inspired by evolutionary ecology and, more particularly, bacteriologic adaptation. Evolutionary ecology is the study of living organisms in the context of their environment, with the aim of discovering how they adapt. Its basic concept is that in a heterogeneous environment, there is not one individual that fits the whole environment. So, one needs to reason at the population level. It is also believed BAs could be successfully applied to complex positioning problems (antennas for cell phones, urban planning, and so on) or data mining.
* Cultural algorithm (CA) consists of the population component almost identical to that of the genetic algorithm and, in addition, a knowledge component called the belief space.
* Differential evolution (DE) inspired by migration of superorganisms.
* Gaussian adaptation (normal or natural adaptation, abbreviated NA to avoid confusion with GA) is intended for the maximisation of manufacturing yield of signal processing systems. It may also be used for ordinary parametric optimisation. It relies on a certain theorem valid for all regions of acceptability and all Gaussian distributions. The efficiency of NA relies on information theory and a certain theorem of efficiency. Its efficiency is defined as information divided by the work needed to get the information. Because NA maximises mean fitness rather than the fitness of the individual, the landscape is smoothed such that valleys between peaks may disappear. Therefore it has a certain &quot;ambition&quot; to avoid local peaks in the fitness landscape. NA is also good at climbing sharp crests by adaptation of the moment matrix, because NA may maximise the disorder (average information) of the Gaussian simultaneously keeping the mean fitness constant.

====Other metaheuristic methods====

Metaheuristic methods broadly fall within stochastic optimisation methods.

* Simulated annealing (SA) is a related global optimization technique that traverses the search space by testing random mutations on an individual solution. A mutation that increases fitness is always accepted. A mutation that lowers fitness is accepted probabilistically based on the difference in fitness and a decreasing temperature parameter. In SA parlance, one speaks of seeking the lowest energy instead of the maximum fitness. SA can also be used within a standard GA algorithm by starting with a relatively high rate of mutation and decreasing it over time along a given schedule.
* Tabu search (TS) is similar to simulated annealing in that both traverse the solution space by testing mutations of an individual solution. While simulated annealing generates only one mutated solution, tabu search generates many mutated solutions and moves to the solution with the lowest energy of those generated. In order to prevent cycling and encourage greater movement through the solution space, a tabu list is maintained of partial or complete solutions. It is forbidden to move to a solution that contains elements of the tabu list, which is updated as the solution traverses the solution space.
* Extremal optimization (EO) Unlike GAs, which work with a population of candidate solutions, EO evolves a single solution and makes local modifications to the worst components. This requires that a suitable representation be selected which permits individual solution components to be assigned a quality measure (&quot;fitness&quot;). The governing principle behind this algorithm is that of &quot;emergent&quot; improvement through selectively removing low-quality components and replacing them with a randomly selected component. This is decidedly at odds with a GA that selects good solutions in an attempt to make better solutions.

====Other stochastic optimisation methods====

* The cross-entropy (CE) method generates candidate solutions via a parameterized probability distribution. The parameters are updated via cross-entropy minimization, so as to generate better samples in the next iteration.
* Reactive search optimization (RSO) advocates the integration of sub-symbolic machine learning techniques into search heuristics for solving complex optimization problems. The word reactive hints at a ready response to events during the search through an internal online feedback loop for the self-tuning of critical parameters. Methodologies of interest for Reactive Search include machine learning and statistics, in particular reinforcement learning, active or query learning, neural networks, and metaheuristics.

<text>Jupiter ( or , from Proto-Italic &quot;day, sky&quot; + &quot;father&quot;, thus &quot;sky father&quot; Greek: Δίας or Ζεύς), also known as Jove (nom. and gen. ), is the god of the sky and thunder, and king of the gods in ancient Roman religion and mythology. Jupiter was the chief deity of Roman state religion throughout the Republican and Imperial eras, until Christianity became the dominant religion of the Empire. In Roman mythology, he negotiates with Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, to establish principles of Roman religion such as offering, or sacrifice.

Jupiter is thought to have originated as a sky god. His identifying implement is the thunderbolt and his primary sacred animal is the eagle, which held precedence over other birds in the taking of auspices and became one of the most common symbols of the Roman army (see Aquila). The two emblems were often combined to represent the god in the form of an eagle holding in its claws a thunderbolt, frequently seen on Greek and Roman coins. As the skygod, he was a divine witness to oaths, the sacred trust on which justice and good government depend. Many of his functions were focused on the Capitoline Hill, where the citadel was located. In the Capitoline Triad, he was the central guardian of the state with Juno and Minerva. His sacred tree was the oak.

The Romans regarded Jupiter as the equivalent of the Greek Zeus, and in Latin literature and Roman art, the myths and iconography of Zeus are adapted under the name &quot;Jupiter&quot;. In the Greek-influenced tradition, Jupiter was the brother of Neptune and Pluto, the Roman equivalents of Poseidon and Hades respectively. Each presided over one of the three realms of the universe: sky, the waters, and the underworld. The Italic Diespiter was also a sky god who manifested himself in the daylight, usually identified with Jupiter. Tinia is usually regarded as his Etruscan counterpart.

== Role in the state ==
The Romans believed that Jupiter granted them supremacy because they had honoured him more than any other people had. Jupiter was &quot;the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested.&quot; He personified the divine authority of Rome&#x27;s highest offices, internal organization, and external relations. His image in the Republican and Imperial Capitol bore regalia associated with Rome&#x27;s ancient kings and the highest consular and Imperial honours.

The consuls swore their oath of office in Jupiter&#x27;s name, and honoured him on the annual &quot;feriae&quot; of the Capitol in September. To thank him for his help, and to secure his continued support, they sacrificed a white ox &quot;(bos mas)&quot; with gilded horns. A similar sacrificial offering was made by triumphal generals, who surrendered the tokens of their victory at the feet of Jupiter&#x27;s statue in the Capitol. Some scholars have viewed the &quot;triumphator&quot; as embodying (or impersonating) Jupiter in the triumphal procession.

Jupiter&#x27;s association with kingship and sovereignty was reinterpreted as Rome&#x27;s form of government changed. Originally, Rome was ruled by kings; after the monarchy was abolished and the Republic established, religious prerogatives were transferred to the &quot;patres&quot;, the patrician ruling class. Nostalgia for the kingship &quot;(affectatio regni)&quot; was considered treasonous. Those suspected of harbouring monarchical ambitions were punished, regardless of their service to the state. In the 5th century BC, the &quot;triumphator&quot; Camillus was sent into exile after he drove a chariot with a team of four white horses &quot;(quadriga)&quot;—an honour reserved for Jupiter himself. When Marcus Manlius, whose defense of the Capitol against the invading Gauls had earned him the name &quot;Capitolinus&quot;, was accused of regal pretensions, he was executed as a traitor by being cast from the Tarpeian Rock. His house on the Capitoline Hill was razed, and it was decreed that no patrician should ever be allowed to live there. Capitoline Jupiter represented a continuity of royal power from the Regal period, and conferred power to the magistrates who paid their respects to him.

During the Conflict of the Orders, Rome&#x27;s plebeians demanded the right to hold political and religious office. During their first &quot;secessio&quot; (similar to a general strike), they withdrew from the city and threatened to found their own. When they agreed to come back to Rome they vowed the hill where they had retreated to Jupiter as symbol and guarantor of the unity of the Roman &quot;res publica&quot;. Plebeians eventually became eligible for all the magistracies and most priesthoods, but the high priest of Jupiter &quot;(Flamen Dialis)&quot; remained the preserve of patricians.

=== Flamen and Flaminica Dialis ===


Jupiter was served by the patrician Flamen Dialis, the highest-ranking member of the &quot;flamines,&quot; a college of fifteen priests in the official public cult of Rome, each of whom was devoted to a particular deity. His wife, the Flaminica Dialis, had her own duties, and presided over the sacrifice of a ram to Jupiter on each of the &quot;nundinae&quot;, the &quot;market&quot; days of a calendar cycle, comparable to a week. The couple were required to marry by the exclusive patrician ritual &quot;confarreatio&quot;, which included a sacrifice of spelt bread to Jupiter Farreus (from &quot;far&quot;, &quot;wheat, grain&quot;).

The office of Flamen Dialis was circumscribed by several unique ritual prohibitions, some of which shed light on the sovereign nature of the god himself. For instance, the &quot;flamen&quot; may remove his clothes or &quot;apex&quot; (his pointed hat) only when under a roof, in order to avoid showing himself naked to the sky—that is, &quot;as if under the eyes of Jupiter&quot; as god of the heavens. Every time the Flaminica saw a lightning bolt or heard a clap of thunder (Jupiter&#x27;s distinctive instrument), she was prohibited from carrying on with her normal routine until she placated the god.

Some privileges of the &quot;flamen&quot; of Jupiter may reflect the regal nature of Jupiter: he had the use of the curule chair, and was the only priest &quot;(sacerdos)&quot; who was preceded by a lictor and had a seat in the senate. Other regulations concern his ritual purity and his separation from the military function; he was forbidden to ride a horse or see the army outside the sacred boundary of Rome &quot;(pomerium).&quot; Although he served the god who embodied the sanctity of the oath, it was not religiously permissible &quot;(fas)&quot; for the Dialis to swear an oath. He could not have contacts with anything dead or connected with death: corpses, funerals, funeral fires, raw meat. This set of restrictions reflects the fulness of life and absolute freedom that are features of Jupiter.

=== Augurs ===
The &quot;augures publici&quot;, augurs were a college of &quot;sacerdotes&quot; who were in charge of all inaugurations and of the performing of ceremonies known as &quot;auguria&quot;. Their creation was traditionally ascribed to Romulus. They were considered the only official interpreters of Jupiter&#x27;s will, thence they were essential to the very existence of the Roman State as Romans saw in Jupiter the only source of state authority.

=== Fetials ===
The fetials were a college of 20 men devoted to the religious administration of international affairs of state. Their task was to preserve and apply the fetial law &quot;(ius fetiale)&quot;, a complex set of procedures aimed at ensuring the protection of the gods in Rome&#x27;s relations with foreign states. Iuppiter Lapis is the god under whose protection they act, and whom the chief fetial &quot;(pater patratus)&quot; invokes in the rite concluding a treaty. If a declaration of war ensues, the fetial calls upon Jupiter and Quirinus, the heavenly, earthly and chthonic gods as witnesses of any potential violation of the &quot;ius&quot;. He can then declare war within 33 days.

The action of the fetials falls under Jupiter&#x27;s jurisdiction as the divine defender of good faith. Several emblems of the fetial office pertain to Jupiter. The &quot;silex&quot; was the stone used for the fetial sacrifice, housed in the Temple of Iuppiter Feretrius, as was their sceptre. Sacred herbs &quot;(sagmina)&quot;, sometimes identified as vervain, had to be taken from the nearby citadel &quot;(arx)&quot; for their ritual use.

=== Jupiter and religion in the secessions of the plebs ===
The role of Jupiter in the conflict of the orders is a reflection of the religiosity of the Romans. On one side, the patricians were able to naturally claim the support of the supreme god as they held the auspices of the State. On the other side, the plebs (plebeians) argued that, as Jupiter was the source of justice, they had his favor because their cause was just.

The first secession was caused by the excessive debt burden on the plebs. The legal institute of the &quot;nexum&quot; permitted a debtor to become a slave of his creditor. The plebs argued the debts had become unsustainable because of the expenses of the wars wanted by the patricians. As the senate did not accede to the proposal of a total debt remission advanced by dictator and augur Manius Valerius Maximus the plebs retired on the Mount Sacer, a hill located three Roman miles to the North-northeast of Rome, past the Nomentan bridge on river Anio. The place is windy and was usually the site of rites of divination performed by haruspices. The senate in the end sent a delegation composed of ten members with full powers of making a deal with the plebs, of which were part Menenius Agrippa and Manius Valerius. It was Valerius, according to the inscription found at Arezzo in 1688 and written on the order of Augustus as well as other literary sources, that brought the plebs down from the Mount, after the secessionists had consecrated it to &quot;Jupiter Territor&quot; and built an altar (&quot;ara&quot;) on its summit. The fear of the wrath of Jupiter was an important element in the solution of the crisis. The consecration of the Mount probably referred to its summit only. The ritual requested the participation of both an augur (presumably Manius Valerius himself) and a pontifex.

The second secession was caused by the autocratic and arrogant behaviour of the &quot;decemviri&quot;, who had been charged by the Roman people with writing down the laws in use till then kept secret by the patrician magistrates and the &quot;sacerdotes&quot;. All magistracies and the tribunes of the plebs had resigned in advance. The task resulted in the XII Tables, which though concerned only private law. The plebs once again retreated to the Sacer Mons: this act besides recalling the first secession was meant to seek the protection of the supreme god. The secession ended with the resignation of the &quot;decemviri&quot; and an amnesty for the rebellious soldiers who had deserted from their camp near Mount Algidus while warring against the Volscians, abandoning the commanders. The amnesty was granted by the senate and guaranteed by the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; Quintus Furius (in Livy&#x27;s version) (or Marcus Papirius) who also supervised the nomination of the new tribunes of the plebs, then gathered on the Aventine Hill. The role played by the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; in a situation of vacation of powers is a significant element underlining the religious basis and character of the &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot;.

== Myths and legends ==

A dominant line of scholarship has held that Rome lacked a body of myths in its earliest period, or that this original mythology has been irrecoverably obscured by the influence of the Greek narrative tradition. After the influence of Greek culture on Roman culture, Latin literature and iconography reinterpreted the myths of Zeus in depictions and narratives of Jupiter. In the legendary history of Rome, Jupiter is often connected to kings and kingship.

=== Birth ===
Jupiter is depicted as the twin of Juno in a statue at Praeneste that showed them nursed by Fortuna Primigenia. An inscription that is also from Praeneste, however, says that Fortuna Primigenia was Jupiter&#x27;s first-born child. Jacqueline Champeaux sees this contradiction as the result of successive different cultural and religious phases, in which a wave of influence coming from the Hellenic world made Fortuna the daughter of Jupiter. The childhood of Zeus is an important theme in Greek religion, art and literature, but there are only rare (or dubious) depictions of Jupiter as a child.

=== Numa Pompilius ===
Faced by a period of bad weather endangering the harvest during one early spring, King Numa resorted to the scheme of asking the advice of the god by evoking his presence. He succeeded through the help of Picus and Faunus, whom he had imprisoned by making them drunk. The two gods (with a charm) evoked Jupiter, who was forced to come down to earth at the Aventine (hence named &quot;Iuppiter Elicius&quot;, according to Ovid). After Numa skilfully avoided the requests of the god for human sacrifices, Jupiter agreed to his request to know how lightning bolts are averted, asking only for the substitutions Numa had mentioned: an onion bulb, hairs and a fish. Moreover, Jupiter promised that at the sunrise of the following day he would give to Numa and the Roman people pawns of the &quot;imperium&quot;. The following day, after throwing three lightning bolts across a clear sky, Jupiter sent down from heaven a shield. Since this shield had no angles, Numa named it &quot;ancile&quot;; because in it resided the fate of the &quot;imperium&quot;, he had many copies made of it to disguise the real one. He asked the smith Mamurius Veturius to make the copies, and gave them to the Salii. As his only reward, Mamurius expressed the wish that his name be sung in the last of their &quot;carmina&quot;. Plutarch gives a slightly different version of the story, writing that the cause of the miraculous drop of the shield was a plague and not linking it with the Roman &quot;imperium&quot;.

=== Tullus Hostilius ===
Throughout his reign, King Tullus had a scornful attitude towards religion. His temperament was warlike, and he disregarded religious rites and piety. After conquering the Albans with the duel between the Horatii and Curiatii, Tullus destroyed Alba Longa and deported its inhabitants to Rome. As Livy tells the story, omens &quot;(prodigia)&quot; in the form of a rain of stones occurred on the Alban Mount because the deported Albans had disregarded their ancestral rites linked to the sanctuary of Jupiter. In addition to the omens, a voice was heard requesting that the Albans perform the rites. A plague followed and at last the king himself fell ill. As a consequence, the warlike character of Tullus broke down; he resorted to religion and petty, superstitious practices. At last, he found a book by Numa recording a secret rite on how to evoke &quot;Iuppiter Elicius&quot;. The king attempted to perform it, but since he executed the rite improperly the god threw a lightning bolt which burned down the king&#x27;s house and killed Tullus.

=== Tarquin the Elder ===
When approaching Rome (where Tarquin was heading to try his luck in politics after unsuccessful attempts in his native Tarquinii), an eagle swooped down, removed his hat, flew screaming in circles, replaced the hat on his head and flew away. Tarquin&#x27;s wife Tanaquil interpreted this as a sign that he would become king based on the bird, the quadrant of the sky from which it came, the god who had sent it and the fact it touched his hat (an item of clothing placed on a man&#x27;s most noble part, the head).

The Elder Tarquin is credited with introducing the Capitoline Triad to Rome, by building the so-called Capitolium Vetus. Macrobius writes this issued from his Samothracian mystery beliefs.

== Cult ==

=== Sacrifices ===
Sacrificial victims (&quot;hostiae&quot;) offered to Jupiter were the ox (castrated bull), the lamb (on the Ides, the &quot;ovis idulis&quot;) and the (a castrated goat or castrated ram) (on the Ides of January). The animals were required to be white. The question of the lamb&#x27;s gender is unresolved; while a sacrificial lamb for a male deity was usually male, for the vintage-opening festival the flamen Dialis sacrificed a ewe lamb to Jupiter. This rule seems to have had many exceptions, as the sacrifice of a ram on the Nundinae by the &quot;flaminica Dialis&quot; demonstrates.
During one of the crises of the Punic Wars, Jupiter was offered every animal born that year.

=== Temples ===
==== Temple of Capitoline Jupiter ====

The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus stood on the Capitoline Hill in Rome. Jupiter was worshiped there as an individual deity, and with Juno and Minerva as part of the Capitoline Triad. The building was supposedly begun by king Tarquinius Priscus, completed by the last king (Tarquinius Superbus) and inaugurated in the early days of the Roman Republic (13 September 509 BC). It was topped with the statues of four horses drawing a quadriga, with Jupiter as charioteer. A large statue of Jupiter stood within; on festival days, its face was painted red. In (or near) this temple was the &quot;Iuppiter Lapis&quot;: the Jupiter Stone, on which oaths could be sworn.

Jupiter&#x27;s Capitoline Temple probably served as the architectural model for his provincial temples.
When Hadrian built Aelia Capitolina on the site of Jerusalem, a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was erected in the place of the destroyed Temple in Jerusalem.

==== Other temples in Rome ====
There were two temples in Rome dedicated to &quot;Iuppiter Stator&quot;; the first one was built and dedicated in 294 BC by Marcus Atilius Regulus after the third Samnite War. It was located on the &quot;Via Nova&quot;, below the &quot;Porta Mugonia&quot;, ancient entrance to the Palatine. Legend attributed its founding to Romulus. There may have been an earlier shrine &quot;(fanum)&quot;, since the Jupiter cult is attested epigraphically. Ovid places the temple&#x27;s dedication on 27 June, but it is unclear whether this was the original date, or the rededication after the restoration by Augustus.
A second temple of &quot;Iuppiter Stator&quot; was built and dedicated by Quintus Caecilus Metellus Macedonicus after his triumph in 146 BC near the Circus Flaminius. It was connected to the restored temple of &quot;Iuno Regina&quot; with a portico (&quot;porticus Metelli&quot;). Augustus constructed the Temple of Jupiter Tonans near that of Jupiter Capitolinus between 26 and 22 BC.

&quot;Iuppiter Victor&quot; had a temple dedicated by Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges during the third Samnite War in 295 BC. It was probably on the Quirinal, on which an inscription reading &quot;Diovei Victore&quot; has been found, but was eclipsed by the imperial period by the Temple of Jupiter Invictus on the Palatine, which was often referred to by the same name. Inscriptions from the imperial age have revealed the existence of an otherwise-unknown temple of &quot;Iuppiter Propugnator&quot; on the Palatine.

=== Iuppiter Latiaris and Feriae Latinae ===
The cult of &quot;Iuppiter Latiaris&quot; was the most ancient known cult of the god: it was practised since very remote times near the top of the &quot;Mons Albanus&quot; on which the god was venerated as the high protector of the Latin League under the hegemony of Alba Longa.

After the destruction of Alba by king Tullus Hostilius the cult was forsaken. The god manifested his discontent through the prodigy of a rain of stones: the commission sent by the Roman senate to inquire was also greeted by a rain of stones and heard a loud voice from the grove on the summit of the mount requesting the Albans perform the religious service to the god according to the rites of their country. In consequence of this event the Romans instituted a festival of nine days (&quot;nundinae&quot;). Nonetheless a plague ensued: in the end Tullus Hostilius himself was affected and lastly killed by the god with a lightning bolt. The festival was reestablished on its primitive site by the last Roman king Tarquin the Proud under the leadership of Rome.

The &quot;feriae Latinae&quot;, or &quot;Latiar&quot; as they were known originally, were the common festival (&quot;panegyris&quot;) of the so-called Priscan Latins and of the Albans. Their restoration aimed at grounding Roman hegemony in this ancestral religious tradition of the Latins. The original cult was reinstated unchanged as is testified by some archaic features of the ritual: the exclusion of wine from the sacrifice the offers of milk and cheese and the ritual use of rocking among the games. Rocking is one of the most ancient rites mimicking ascent to Heaven and is very widespread. At the &quot;Latiar&quot; the rocking took place on a tree and the winner was of course the one who had swung the highest. This rite was said to have been instituted by the Albans to commemorate the disappearance of king Latinus, in the battle against Mezentius king of Caere: the rite symbolised a search for him both on earth and in heaven. The rocking as well as the customary drinking of milk was also considered to commemorate and ritually reinstate infancy. The Romans in the last form of the rite brought the sacrificial ox from Rome and every participant was bestowed a portion of the meat, rite known as &quot;carnem petere&quot;. Other games were held in every participant borough. In Rome a race of chariots (&quot;quadrigae&quot;) was held starting from the Capitol: the winner drank a liquor made with absynth. This competition has been compared to the Vedic rite of the vajapeya: in it seventeen chariots run a phoney race which must be won by the king in order to allow him to drink a cup of &quot;madhu&quot;, i. e. &quot;soma&quot;. The feasting lasted for at least four days, possibly six according to Niebuhr, one day for each of the six Latin and Alban &quot;decuriae&quot;. According to different records 47 or 53 boroughs took part in the festival (the listed names too differ in Pliny &quot;Naturalis historia&quot; III 69 and Dionysius of Halicarnassus AR V 61). The &quot;Latiar&quot; became an important feature of Roman political life as they were &quot;feriae conceptivae&quot;, i. e. their date varied each year: the consuls and the highest magistrates were required to attend shortly after the beginning of the administration, originally on the Ides of March: the Feriae usually took place in early April. They could not start campaigning before its end and if any part of the games had been neglected or performed unritually the &quot;Latiar&quot; had to be wholly repeated. The inscriptions from the imperial age record the festival back to the time of the decemvirs.
Wissowa remarks the inner linkage of the temple of the Mons Albanus with that of the Capitol apparent in the common association with the rite of the triumph: since 231 BC some triumphing commanders had triumphed there first with the same legal features as in Rome.

== Religious calendar ==
=== Ides ===
The Ides (the midpoint of the month, with a full moon) was sacred to Jupiter, because on that day heavenly light shone day and night. Some (or all) Ides were &quot;Feriae Iovis&quot;, sacred to Jupiter. On the Ides, a white lamb (&quot;ovis idulis&quot;) was led along Rome&#x27;s Sacred Way to the Capitoline Citadel and sacrificed to him. Jupiter&#x27;s two &quot;epula Iovis&quot; festivals fell on the Ides, as did his temple foundation rites as &quot;Optimus Maximus&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Invictus&quot; and (possibly) &quot;Stator&quot;.

=== Nundinae ===
The &quot;nundinae&quot; recurred every ninth day, dividing the calendar into a market cycle analogous to a week. Market days gave rural people &quot;(pagi)&quot; the opportunity to sell in town and to be informed of religious and political edicts, which were posted publicly for three days. According to tradition, these festival days were instituted by the king Servius Tullius. The high priestess of Jupiter &quot;(Flaminica Dialis)&quot; sanctified the days by sacrificing a ram to Jupiter.

=== Festivals ===

During the Republican era, more fixed holidays on the Roman calendar were devoted to Jupiter than to any other deity.

==== Viniculture and wine ====
Festivals of viniculture and wine were devoted to Jupiter, since grapes were particularly susceptible to adverse weather. Dumézil describes wine as a &quot;kingly&quot; drink with the power to inebriate and exhilarate, analogous to the Vedic Soma.

Three Roman festivals were connected with viniculture and wine.

The rustic &quot;Vinalia altera&quot; on 19 August asked for good weather for ripening the grapes before harvest. When the grapes were ripe, a sheep was sacrificed to Jupiter and the &quot;flamen Dialis&quot; cut the first of the grape harvest.

The Meditrinalia on 11 October marked the end of the grape harvest; the new wine was pressed, tasted and mixed with old wine to control fermentation. In the &quot;Fasti Amiternini&quot;, this festival is assigned to Jupiter. Later Roman sources invented a goddess &quot;Meditrina&quot;, probably to explain the name of the festival.

At the &quot;Vinalia urbana&quot; on 23 April, new wine was offered to Jupiter. Large quantities of it were poured into a ditch near the temple of Venus Erycina, which was located on the Capitol.

==== Regifugium and Poplifugium ====

The &quot;Regifugium&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s Flight&quot;) on 24 February has often been discussed in connection with the &quot;Poplifugia&quot; on 5 July, a day holy to Jupiter. The &quot;Regifugium&quot; followed the festival of &quot;Iuppiter Terminus&quot; (Jupiter of Boundaries) on 23 February. Later Roman antiquarians misinterpreted the &quot;Regifugium&quot; as marking the expulsion of the monarchy, but the &quot;king&quot; of this festival may have been the priest known as the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; who ritually enacted the waning and renewal of power associated with the New Year (1 March in the old Roman calendar). A temporary vacancy of power (construed as a yearly &quot;interregnum&quot;) occurred between the &quot;Regifugium&quot; on 24 February and the New Year on 1 March (when the lunar cycle was thought to coincide again with the solar cycle), and the uncertainty and change during the two winter months were over. Some scholars emphasize the traditional political significance of the day.

The &quot;Poplifugia&quot; (&quot;Routing of Armies&quot;), a day sacred to Jupiter, may similarly mark the second half of the year; before the Julian calendar reform, the months were named numerically, &quot;Quintilis&quot; (the fifth month) to &quot;December&quot; (the tenth month). The &quot;Poplifugia&quot; was a &quot;primitive military ritual&quot; for which the adult male population assembled for purification rites, after which they ritually dispelled foreign invaders from Rome.

==== Epula Iovis ====

There were two festivals called &quot;epulum Iovis&quot; (&quot;Feast of Jove&quot;). One was held on 13 September, the anniversary of the foundation of Jupiter&#x27;s Capitoline temple. The other (and probably older) festival was part of the Plebeian Games &quot;(Ludi Plebei)&quot;, and was held on 13 November. In the 3rd century BC, the &quot;epulum Iovis&quot; became similar to a lectisternium.

==== Ludi ====

The most ancient Roman games followed after one day (considered a &quot;dies ater&quot;, or &quot;black day&quot;, i. e. a day which was traditionally considered unfortunate even though it was not &quot;nefas&quot;, see also article Glossary of ancient Roman religion) the two &quot;Epula Iovis&quot; of September and November.

The games of September were named &quot;Ludi Magni&quot;; originally they were not held every year, but later became the annual &quot;Ludi Romani&quot; and were held in the Circus Maximus after a procession from the Capitol. The games were attributed to Tarquinius Priscus, and linked to the cult of Jupiter on the Capitol. Romans themselves acknowledged analogies with the triumph, which Dumézil thinks can be explained by their common Etruscan origin; the magistrate in charge of the games dressed as the &quot;triumphator&quot; and the &quot;pompa circensis&quot; resembled a triumphal procession. Wissowa and Mommsen argue that they were a detached part of the triumph on the above grounds (a conclusion which Dumézil rejects).

The &quot;Ludi Plebei&quot; took place in November in the Circus Flaminius.
Mommsen argued that the &quot;epulum&quot; of the Ludi Plebei was the model of the Ludi Romani, but Wissowa finds the evidence for this assumption insufficient. The &quot;Ludi Plebei&quot; were probably established in 534 BC. Their association with the cult of Jupiter is attested by Cicero.

==== Larentalia ====
The &quot;feriae&quot; of 23 December were devoted to a major ceremony in honour of Acca Larentia (or &quot;Larentina&quot;), in which some of the highest religious authorities participated (probably including the Flamen Quirinalis and the pontiffs). The Fasti Praenestini marks the day as &quot;feriae Iovis&quot;, as does Macrobius. It is unclear whether the rite of &quot;parentatio&quot; was itself the reason for the festival of Jupiter, or if this was another festival which happened to fall on the same day. Wissowa denies their association, since Jupiter and his &quot;flamen&quot; would not be involved with the underworld or the deities of death (or be present at a funeral rite held at a gravesite).

== Name and epithets ==
The Latin name &quot;Iuppiter&quot; originated as a vocative compound of the Old Latin vocative *&quot;Iou&quot; and &quot;pater&quot; (&quot;father&quot;) and came to replace the Old Latin nominative case *&quot;Ious&quot;. Jove is a less common English formation based on &quot;Iov-&quot;, the stem of oblique cases of the Latin name. Linguistic studies identify the form *&quot;Iou-pater&quot; as deriving from the Proto-Italic vocable *&quot;Djous Patēr&quot;, and ultimately the Indo-European vocative compound *&quot;Dyēu-pəter&quot; (meaning &quot;O Father Sky-god&quot;; nominative: *&quot;Dyēus-pətēr&quot;).

Older forms of the deity&#x27;s name in Rome were &quot;Dieus-pater&quot; (&quot;day/sky-father&quot;), then &quot;Diéspiter&quot;. The 19th-century philologist Georg Wissowa asserted these names are conceptually- and linguistically-connected to &quot;Diovis&quot; and &quot;Diovis Pater&quot;; he compares the analogous formations &quot;Vedius&quot;-&quot;Veiove&quot; and &quot;fulgur Dium&quot;, as opposed to &quot;fulgur Summanum&quot; (nocturnal lightning bolt) and &quot;flamen Dialis&quot; (based on &quot;Dius&quot;, &quot;dies&quot;). The Ancient later viewed them as entities separate from Jupiter. The terms are similar in etymology and semantics (&quot;dies&quot;, &quot;daylight&quot; and &quot;Dius&quot;, &quot;daytime sky&quot;), but differ linguistically. Wissowa considers the epithet &quot;Dianus&quot; noteworthy. &quot;Dieus&quot; is the etymological equivalent of ancient Greece&#x27;s &quot;Zeus&quot; and of the Teutonics&#x27; &quot;Ziu&quot; (genitive &quot;Ziewes&quot;). The Indo-European deity is the god from which the names and partially the theology of Jupiter, Zeus and the Indo-Aryan Vedic Dyaus Pita derive or have developed.

The Roman practice of swearing by Jove to witness an oath in law courts is the origin of the expression &quot;by Jove!&quot;—archaic, but still in use. The name of the god was also adopted as the name of the planet Jupiter; the adjective &quot;&quot; originally described those born under the planet of Jupiter (reputed to be jolly, optimistic, and buoyant in temperament).

Jove was the original namesake of Latin forms of the weekday now known in English as Thursday (originally called &quot;Iovis Dies&quot; in Latin). These became &quot;jeudi&quot; in French, &quot;jueves&quot; in Spanish, &quot;joi&quot; in Romanian, &quot;giovedì&quot; in Italian, &quot;dijous&quot; in Catalan, &quot;Xoves&quot; in Galician, &quot;Joibe&quot; in Friulian and &quot;Dijóu&quot; in Provençal.

=== Major epithets ===

The epithets of a Roman god indicate his theological qualities. The study of these epithets must consider their origins (the historical context of an epithet&#x27;s source).

Jupiter&#x27;s most ancient attested forms of cult belong to the State cult: these include the mount cult (see section above note n. 22). In Rome this cult entailed the existence of particular sanctuaries the most important of which were located on &quot;Mons Capitolinus&quot; (earlier &quot;Tarpeius&quot;). The mount had two tops that were both destined to the discharge of acts of cult related to Jupiter. The northern and higher top was the &quot;arx&quot; and on it was located the observation place of the augurs &quot;(auguraculum)&quot; and to it headed the monthly procession of the &quot;sacra Idulia&quot;. On the southern top was to be found the most ancient sanctuary of the god: the shrine of &quot;Iuppiter Feretrius&quot; allegedly built by Romulus, restored by Augustus. The god here had no image and was represented by the sacred flintstone (&quot;silex&quot;). The most ancient known rites, those of the &quot;spolia opima&quot; and of the fetials which connect Jupiter with Mars and Quirinus are dedicated to &quot;Iuppiter Feretrius&quot; or &quot;Iuppiter Lapis&quot;. The concept of the sky god was already overlapped with the ethical and political domain since this early time. According to Wissowa and Dumézil &quot;Iuppiter Lapis&quot; seems to be inseparable from &quot;Iuppiter Feretrius&quot;, in whose tiny temple on the Capitol the stone was lodged.

Another most ancient epithet is &quot;Lucetius&quot;: although the Ancients, followed by some modern scholars such as Wissowa, interpreted it as referring to sunlight, the &quot;carmen Saliare&quot; shows that it refers to lightning. A further confirmation of this interpretation is provided by the sacred meaning of lightning which is reflected in the sensitivity of the &quot;flaminica Dialis&quot; to the phenomenon. To the same atmospheric complex belongs the epithet &quot;Elicius&quot;: while the ancient erudites thought it was connected to lightning, it is in fact related to the opening of the rervoirs of rain, as is testified by the ceremony of the &quot;Nudipedalia&quot;, meant to propitiate rainfall and devoted to Jupiter. and the ritual of the &quot;lapis manalis&quot;, the stone which was brought into the city through the &quot;Porta Capena&quot; and carried around in times of drought, which was named &quot;Aquaelicium&quot;. Other early epithets connected with the atmospheric quality of Jupiter are &quot;Pluvius&quot;, &quot;Imbricius&quot;, &quot;Tempestas&quot;, &quot;Tonitrualis&quot;, &quot;tempestatium divinarum potens&quot;, &quot;Serenator&quot;, &quot;Serenus&quot; and, referred to lightning, &quot;Fulgur&quot;, &quot;Fulgur Fulmen&quot;, later as nomen agentis &quot;Fulgurator&quot;, &quot;Fulminator&quot;: the high antiquity of the cult is testified by the neutre form &quot;Fulgur&quot; and the use of the term for the &quot;bidental&quot;, the lightning well dug on the spot hit by a lightning bolt.
A group of epithets has been interpreted by Wissowa (and his followers) as a reflection of the agricultural or warring nature of the god, some of which are also in the list of eleven preserved by Augustine. The agricultural ones include &quot;Opitulus&quot;, &quot;Almus&quot;, &quot;Ruminus&quot;, &quot;Frugifer&quot;, &quot;Farreus&quot;, &quot;Pecunia&quot;, &quot;Dapalis&quot;, &quot;Epulo&quot;. Augustine gives an explanation of the ones he lists which should reflect Varro&#x27;s: &quot;Opitulus&quot; because he brings &quot;opem&quot; (means, relief) to the needy, &quot;Almus&quot; because he nourishes everything, &quot;Ruminus&quot; because he nourishes the living beings by breastfeeding them, &quot;Pecunia&quot; because everything belongs to him.
Dumézil maintains the cult usage of these epithets is not documented and that the epithet Ruminus, as Wissowa and Latte remarked, may not have the meaning given by Augustine but it should be understood as part of a series including &quot;Rumina&quot;, &quot; Ruminalis ficus&quot;, &quot;Iuppiter Ruminus&quot;, which bears the name of Rome itself with an Etruscan vocalism preserved in inscriptions, series that would be preserved in the sacred language (cf. &quot;Rumach&quot; Etruscan for Roman). However many scholars have argued that the name of Rome, &quot;Ruma&quot;, meant in fact woman&#x27;s breast. Diva Rumina, as Augustine testifies in the cited passage, was the goddess of suckling babies: she was venerated near the &quot;ficus ruminalis&quot; and was offered only libations of milk. Here moreover Augustine cites the verses devoted to Jupiter by Quintus Valerius Soranus, while hypothesising &quot;Iuno&quot; (more adept in his view as a breastfeeder), i.e. Rumina instead of Ruminus, might be nothing else than &quot;Iuppiter&quot;: &quot;Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque Progenitor genetrixque deum...&quot;.

In Dumézil&#x27;s opinion &quot;Farreus&quot; should be understood as related to the rite of the &quot;confarreatio&quot; the most sacred form of marriage, the name of which is due to the spelt cake eaten by the spouses, rather than surmising an agricultural quality of the god: the epithet means the god was the guarantor of the effects of the ceremony, to which the presence of his flamen is necessary and that he can interrupt with a clap of thunder.

The epithet &quot;Dapalis&quot; is on the other hand connected to a rite described by Cato and mentioned by Festus. Before the sowing of autumn or spring the peasant offered a banquet of roast beef and a cup of wine to Jupiter : it is natural that on such occasions he would entreat the god who has power over the weather, however Cato&#x27; s prayer of s one of sheer offer and no request. The language suggests another attitude: Jupiter is invited to a banquet which is supposedly abundant and magnificent. The god is honoured as &quot;summus&quot;. The peasant may hope he shall receive a benefit, but he does not say it. This interpretation finds support in the analogous urban ceremony of the &quot;epulum Iovis&quot;, from which the god derives the epithet of &quot;Epulo&quot; and which was a magnificent feast accompanied by flutes.

Epithets related to warring are in Wissowa&#x27;s view &quot;Iuppiter Feretrius&quot;, &quot;Iuppiter Stator&quot;, &quot;Iuppiter Victor&quot; and &quot;Iuppiter Invictus&quot;. &quot;Feretrius&quot; would be connected with war by the rite of the first type of &quot;spolia opima&quot; which is in fact a dedication to the god of the arms of the defeated king of the enemy that happens whenever he has been killed by the king of Rome or his equivalent authority. Here too Dumézil notes the dedication has to do with regality and not with war, since the rite is in fact the offer of the arms of a king by a king: a proof of such an assumption is provided by the fact that the arms of an enemy king captured by an officer or a common soldier were dedicated to Mars and Quirinus respectively.

&quot;Iuppiter Stator&quot; was first attributed by tradition to Romulus, who had prayed to the god for his almighty help at a difficult time during the battle with the Sabines of king Titus Tatius. Dumézil opines the action of Jupiter is not that of a god of war who wins through fighting: Jupiter acts by causing an inexplicable change in the morale of the fighters of the two sides. The same feature can be detected also in the certainly historical record of the battle of the third Samnite War in 294 BC, in which consul Marcus Atilius Regulus vowed a temple to &quot;Iuppiter Stator&quot; if &quot;Jupiter will stop the rout of the Roman army and if afterwards the Samnite legions shall be victouriously massacred...It looked as if the gods themselves had taken side with Romans, so much easily did the Roman arms succeed in prevailing...&quot;. In a similar manner one can explain the epithet &quot;Victor&quot;, whose cult was founded in 295 BC on the battlefield of Sentinum by Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges and who received another vow again in 293 by consul Lucius Papirius Cursor before a battle against the Samnite &quot;legio linteata&quot;. The religious meaning of the vow is in both cases an appeal to the supreme god by a Roman chief at a time of need for divine help from the supreme god, albeit for different reasons: Fabius had remained the only political and military responsible of the Roman State after the &quot;devotio&quot; of P. Decius Mus, Papirius had to face an enemy who had acted with impious rites and vows, i.e. was religiously reprehensible.

More recently Dario Sabbatucci has given a different interpretation of the meaning of &quot;Stator&quot; within the frame of his structuralistic and dialectic vision of Roman calendar, identifying oppositions, tensions and equilibria: January is the month of Janus, at the beginning of the year, in the uncertain time of winter (the most ancient calendar had only ten months, from March to December). In this month Janus deifies kingship and defies Jupiter. Moreover, January sees also the presence of Veiovis who appears as an anti-Jupiter, of Carmenta who is the goddess of birth and like Janus has two opposed faces, &quot;Prorsa&quot; and &quot;Postvorta&quot; (also named Antevorta and Porrima), of Iuturna, who as a gushing spring evokes the process of coming into being from non-being as the god of passage and change does. In this period the preeminence of Janus needs compensating on the Ides through the action of Jupiter &quot;Stator&quot;, who plays the role of anti-Janus, i.e. of moderator of the action of Janus.

==== Epithets denoting functionality ====
Some epithets describe a particular aspect of the god, or one of his functions:
* Jove Aegiochus, Jove &quot;Holder of the Goat or Aegis&quot;, as the father of Aegipan.
* Jupiter Caelus, Jupiter as the sky or heavens; see also Caelus.
* Jupiter Caelestis, &quot;Heavenly&quot; or &quot;Celestial Jupiter&quot;.
* Jupiter Elicius, Jupiter &quot;who calls forth [celestial omens]&quot; or &quot;who is called forth [by incantations]&quot;; &quot;sender of rain&quot;.
* Jupiter Feretrius, who carries away the spoils of war&quot;. Feretrius was called upon to witness solemn oaths. The epithet or &quot;numen&quot; is probably connected with the verb &quot;ferire&quot;, &quot;to strike&quot;, referring to a ritual striking of ritual as illustrated in &quot;foedus ferire&quot;, of which the &quot;silex&quot;, a quartz rock, is evidence in his temple on the Capitoline hill, which is said to have been the first temple in Rome, erected and dedicated by Romulus to commemorate his winning of the &quot;spolia opima&quot; from Acron, king of the Caeninenses, and to serve as a repository for them. &quot;Iuppiter Feretrius&quot; was therefore equivalent to &quot;Iuppiter Lapis&quot;, the latter used for a specially solemn oath. According to Livy I 10, 5 and Plutarch &quot;Marcellus&quot; 8 though, the meaning of this epithet is related to the peculiar frame used to carry the &quot;spolia opima&quot; to the god, the &quot;feretrum&quot;, itself from verb &quot;fero&quot;,
* Jupiter Centumpeda, literally, &quot;he who has one hundred feet&quot;; that is, &quot;he who has the power of establishing, of rendering stable, bestowing stability on everything&quot;, since he himself is the paramount of stability.
* Jupiter Fulgur (&quot;Lightning Jupiter&quot;), Fulgurator or Fulgens
* Jupiter Lucetius (&quot;of the light&quot;), an epithet almost certainly related to the light or flame of lightningbolts and not to daylight, as indicated by the Jovian verses of the carmen Saliare.
* Jupiter Optimus Maximus (&quot;the best and greatest&quot;). &quot;Optumus&quot; because of the benefits he bestows, &quot;Maximus&quot; because of his strength, according to Cicero &quot;Pro Domo Sua&quot;.
* Jupiter Pluvius, &quot;sender of rain&quot;.
* Jupiter Ruminus, &quot;breastfeeder of every living being&quot;, according to Augustine.
* Jupiter Stator, from &quot;stare&quot;, &quot;to stand&quot;: &quot;he who has power of founding, instituting everything&quot;, thence also he who bestows the power of resistance, making people, soldiers, stand firm and fast.
* Jupiter Summanus, sender of nocturnal thunder
* Jupiter Terminalus or Iuppiter Terminus, patron and defender of boundaries
* Jupiter Tigillus, &quot;beam or shaft that supports and holds together the universe.&quot;
* Jupiter Tonans, &quot;thunderer&quot;
* Jupiter Victor, &quot;he who has the power of conquering everything.&quot;

==== Syncretic or geographical epithets ====
Some epithets of Jupiter indicate his association with a particular place. Epithets found in the provinces of the Roman Empire may identify Jupiter with a local deity or site (see syncretism).
* Jupiter Ammon, Jupiter equated with the Egyptian deity Amun after the Roman conquest of Egypt.
* Jupiter Brixianus, Jupiter equated with the local god of the town of Brescia in Cisalpine Gaul (modern North Italy).
* Jupiter Capitolinus, also Jupiter Optimus Maximus, venerated throughout the Roman Empire at sites with a &quot;Capitol&quot; (Capitolium).
* Jupiter Dolichenus, from Doliche in Syria, originally a Baal weather and war god. From the time of Vespasian, he was popular among the Roman legions as god of war and victory, especially on the Danube at Carnuntum. He is depicted as standing on a bull, with a thunderbolt in his left hand, and a double ax in the right.
* Jupiter Indiges, &quot;Jupiter of the country&quot;, a title given to Aeneas after his death, according to Livy
* Jupiter Jehovah, syncretization between Jupiter and Jehovah (was named as &quot;El hashamayim&quot; by the hellenistic jews, which means &quot;Lord of Heavens&quot;).
* Jupiter Ladicus, Jupiter equated with a Celtiberian mountain-god and worshipped as the spirit of Mount Ladicus in Gallaecia, northwest Iberia, preserved in the toponym &quot;Codos de Ladoco&quot;.
* Jupiter Laterius or Latiaris, the god of Latium.
* Jupiter Parthinus or Partinus, under this name was worshiped on the borders of northeast Dalmatia and Upper Moesia, perhaps associated with the local tribe known as the Partheni.
* Jupiter Poeninus, under this name worshipped in the Alps, around the Great St Bernard Pass, where he had a sanctuary.
* Jupiter Sabazius, syncretization between Jupiter and Sabazius.
* Jupiter Solutorius, a local version of Jupiter worshipped in Spain; he was syncretised with the local Iberian god Eacus.
* Jupiter Taranis, Jupiter equated with the Celtic god Taranis.
* Jupiter Uxellinus, Jupiter as a god of high mountains.

In addition, many of the epithets of Zeus can be found applied to Jupiter, by &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;. Thus, since the hero Trophonius (from Lebadea in Boeotia) is called Zeus Trophonius, this can be represented in English (as it would be in Latin) as Jupiter Trophonius. Similarly, the Greek cult of Zeus Meilichios appears in Pompeii as Jupiter Meilichius. Except in representing actual cults in Italy, this is largely 19th-century usage; modern works distinguish Jupiter from Zeus.

== Theology ==
=== Sources ===
Marcus Terentius Varro and Verrius Flaccus were the main sources on the theology of Jupiter and archaic Roman religion in general. Varro was acquainted with the &quot;libri pontificum&quot; (&quot;books of the Pontiffs&quot;) and their archaic classifications. On these two sources depend other ancient authorities, such as Ovid, Servius, Aulus Gellius, Macrobius, patristic texts, Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Plutarch.

One of the most important sources which preserve the theology of Jupiter and other Roman deities is &quot;The City of God against the Pagans&quot; by Augustine of Hippo. Augustine&#x27;s criticism of traditional Roman religion is based on Varro&#x27;s lost work, &quot;Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum&quot;. Although a work of Christian apologetics, &quot;The City of God&quot; provides glimpses into Varro&#x27;s theological system and authentic Roman theological lore in general. According to Augustine, Varro drew on the pontiff Mucius Scaevola&#x27;s tripartite theology:

* The mythic theology of the poets (useful for the theatre)
* The physical theology of the philosophers (useful for understanding the natural world)
* The civil theology of the priests (useful for the state)

=== Jovian theology ===
Georg Wissowa stressed Jupiter&#x27;s uniqueness as the only case among Indo-European religions in which the original god preserved his name, his identity and his prerogatives. In this view, Jupiter is the god of heaven and retains his identification with the sky among the Latin poets (his name is used as a synonym for &quot;sky&quot;.) In this respect, he differs from his Greek equivalent Zeus (who is considered a personal god, warden and dispenser of skylight). His name reflects this idea; it is a derivative of the Indo-European word for &quot;bright, shining sky&quot;. His residence is found atop the hills of Rome and of mountains in general; as a result, his cult is present in Rome and throughout Italy at upper elevations. Jupiter assumed atmospheric qualities; he is the wielder of lightning and the master of weather. However, Wissowa acknowledges that Jupiter is not merely a naturalistic, heavenly, supreme deity; he is in continual communication with man by means of thunder, lightning and the flight of birds (his auspices). Through his vigilant watch he is also the guardian of public oaths and compacts and the guarantor of good faith in the State cult. The Jovian cult was common to the Italic people under the names &quot;Iove&quot;, &quot;Diove&quot; (Latin) and &quot;Iuve&quot;, &quot;Diuve&quot; (Oscan, in Umbrian only &quot;Iuve&quot;, &quot;Iupater&quot; in the Iguvine Tables).

Wissowa considered Jupiter also a god of war and agriculture, in addition to his political role as guarantor of good faith (public and private) as &quot;Iuppiter Lapis&quot; and &quot;Dius Fidius&quot;, respectively. His view is grounded in the sphere of action of the god (who intervenes in battle and influences the harvest through weather).

In Georges Dumézil&#x27;s view, Jovian theology (and that of the equivalent gods in other Indo-European religions) is an evolution from a naturalistic, supreme, celestial god identified with heaven to a sovereign god, a wielder of lightning bolts, master and protector of the community (in other words, of a change from a naturalistic approach to the world of the divine to a socio-political approach).
In Vedic religion, Dyaus Pitar remained confined to his distant, removed, passive role and the place of sovereign god was occupied by Varuna and Mitra. In Greek and Roman religion, instead, the homonymous gods &quot;*Diou-&quot; and &quot;Διϝ-&quot; evolved into atmospheric deities; by their mastery of thunder and lightning, they expressed themselves and made their will known to the community. In Rome, Jupiter also sent signs to the leaders of the state in the form of auspices in addition to thunder. The art of augury was considered prestigious by ancient Romans; by sending his signs, Jupiter (the sovereign of heaven) communicates his advice to his terrestrial colleague: the king (&quot;rex&quot;) or his successor magistrates. The encounter between the heavenly and political, legal aspects of the deity are well represented by the prerogatives, privileges, functions and taboos proper to his &quot;flamen&quot; (the &quot;flamen Dialis&quot; and his wife, the &quot;flaminica Dialis&quot;).

Dumézil maintains that Jupiter is not himself a god of war and agriculture, although his actions and interest may extend to these spheres of human endeavour. His view is based on the methodological assumption that the chief criterion for studying a god&#x27;s nature is not to consider his field of action, but the quality, method and features of his action. Consequently, the analysis of the type of action performed by Jupiter in the domains in which he operates indicates that Jupiter is a sovereign god who may act in the field of politics (as well as agriculture and war) in his capacity as such, i.e. in a way and with the features proper to a king. Sovereignty is expressed through the two aspects of absolute, magic power (epitomised and represented by the Vedic god Varuna) and lawful right (by the Vedic god Mitra). However, sovereignty permits action in every field; otherwise, it would lose its essential quality. As a further proof, Dumézil cites the story of Tullus Hostilius (the most belligerent of the Roman kings), who was killed by Jupiter with a lightning bolt (indicating that he did not enjoy the god&#x27;s favour).
Varro&#x27;s definition of Jupiter as the god who has under his jurisdiction the full expression of every being (&quot;penes Iovem sunt summa&quot;) reflects the sovereign nature of the god, as opposed to the jurisdiction of Janus (god of passages and change) on their beginning (&quot;penes Ianum sunt prima&quot;).

== Relation to other gods ==
=== Capitoline Triad ===
The Capitoline Triad was introduced to Rome by the Tarquins. Dumézil thinks it might have been an Etruscan (or local) creation based on Vitruvius&#x27; treatise on architecture, in which the three deities are associated as the most important. It is possible that the Etruscans paid particular attention to Menrva (Minerva) as a goddess of destiny, in addition to the royal couple Uni (Juno) and Tinia (Jupiter). In Rome, Minerva later assumed a military aspect under the influence of Athena Pallas (Polias). Dumézil argues that with the advent of the Republic, Jupiter became the only king of Rome, no longer merely the first of the great gods.

==== Archaic Triad ====

The Archaic Triad is a hypothetical theological structure (or system) consisting of the gods Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus. It was first described by Wissowa, and the concept was developed further by Dumézil. The three-function hypothesis of Indo-European society advanced by Dumézil holds that in prehistory, society was divided into three classes:

At least for the three main functions, people in each station in life had their religious counterparts the divine figures of the sovereign god, the warrior god, and the industrius god; there were almost always two separate gods for class 1, and sometimes more than one for class 3. Over time gods or, groups of gods might be consolidated or split, and it is unclear that there were ever any strict separations of all function.

The sovereign function (1) embodied in Jupiter entailed omnipotence; thence, a domain extended over every aspect of nature and life.

The three functions are interrelated with one another, overlapping to some extent; the sovereign function, although including a part that is essentially religious in nature, is involved in many ways in areas pertaining to the other two. Therefore, Jupiter is the &quot;magic player&quot; in the founding of the Roman state and the fields of war, agricultural plenty, human fertility, and wealth.

This hypothesis has not found widespread support among scholars.

=== Jupiter and Minerva ===
Apart from being protectress of the arts and craft as Minerva Capta, who was brought from Falerii, Minerva&#x27;s association to Jupiter and relevance to Roman state religion is mainly linked to the Palladium, a wooden statue of Athena that could move the eyes and wave the spear. It was stored in the &quot;penus interior&quot;, inner penus of the &quot;aedes Vestae&quot;, temple of Vesta and considered the most important among the &quot;pignora imperii&quot;, pawns of dominion, empire. In Roman traditional lore it was brought from Troy by Aeneas. Scholars though think it was last taken to Rome in the third or second century BC.

=== Juno and Fortuna ===
The divine couple received from Greece its matrimonial implications, thence bestowing on Juno the role of tutelary goddess of marriage (&quot;Iuno Pronuba&quot;).

The couple itself though cannot be reduced to a Greek apport. The association of Juno and Jupiter is of the most ancient Latin theology. Praeneste offers a glimpse into original Latin mythology: the local goddess Fortuna is represented as milking two infants, one male and one female, namely Jove (Jupiter) and Juno. It seems fairly safe to assume that from the earliest times they were identified by their own proper names and since they got them they were never changed through the course of history: they were called Jupiter and Juno. These gods were the most ancient deities of every Latin town. Praeneste preserved divine filiation and infancy as the sovereign god and his paredra Juno have a mother who is the primordial goddess Fortuna Primigenia. Many terracotta statuettes have been discovered which represent a woman with a child: one of them represents exactly the scene described by Cicero of a woman with two children of different sex who touch her breast. Two of the votive inscriptions to Fortuna associate her and Jupiter: &quot; Fortunae Iovi puero...&quot; and &quot;Fortunae Iovis puero...&quot;

In 1882 though R. Mowat published an inscription in which Fortuna is called &quot;daughter of Jupiter&quot;, raising new questions and opening new perspectives in the theology of Latin gods. Dumézil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this &quot;aporia&quot; would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion. The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity Aditi, the &quot;Not-Bound&quot; or &quot;Enemy of Bondage&quot;, that shows that there is no question of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the Aditya she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, Dakṣa, the minor sovereign. who represents the &quot;Creative Energy&quot;, being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs. Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with Savitr) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented with her head on her two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions. The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.

=== Janus ===

The relation of Jupiter to Janus is problematic. Varro defines Jupiter as the god who has &quot;potestas&quot; (power) over the forces by which anything happens in the world. Janus, however, has the privilege of being invoked first in rites, since in his power are the beginnings of things (&quot;prima&quot;), the appearance of Jupiter included.

=== Saturn ===

The Latins considered Saturn the predecessor of Jupiter. Saturn reigned in Latium during a mythical Golden Age reenacted every year at the festival of Saturnalia. Saturn also retained primacy in matters of agriculture and money. Unlike the Greek tradition of Cronus and Zeus, the usurpation of Saturn as king of the gods by Jupiter was not viewed by the Latins as violent or hostile; Saturn continued to be revered in his temple at the foot of the Capitol Hill, which maintained the alternative name &quot;Saturnius&quot; into the time of Varro.
A. Pasqualini has argued that Saturn was related to &quot;Iuppiter Latiaris&quot;, the old Jupiter of the Latins, as the original figure of this Jupiter was superseded on the Alban Mount, whereas it preserved its gruesome character in the ceremony held at the sanctuary of the Latiar Hill in Rome which involved a human sacrifice and the aspersion of the statue of the god with the blood of the victim.

=== Fides ===

The abstract personification Fides (&quot;Faith, Trust&quot;) was one of the oldest gods associated with Jupiter. As guarantor of public faith, Fides had her temple on the Capitol (near that of Capitoline Jupiter).

=== Dius Fidius ===

&quot;Dius Fidius&quot; is considered a theonym for Jupiter, and sometimes a separate entity also known in Rome as Semo Sancus Dius Fidius. Wissowa argued that while Jupiter is the god of the &quot;Fides Publica Populi Romani&quot; as &quot;Iuppiter Lapis&quot; (by whom important oaths are sworn), Dius Fidius is a deity established for everyday use and was charged with the protection of good faith in private affairs. Dius Fidius would thus correspond to &quot;Zeus Pistios&quot;. The association with Jupiter may be a matter of divine relation; some scholars see him as a form of Hercules. Both Jupiter and Dius Fidius were wardens of oaths and wielders of lightning bolts; both required an opening in the roof of their temples.

The functionality of Sancus occurs consistently within the sphere of &quot;fides&quot;, oaths and respect for contracts and of the divine-sanction guarantee against their breach. Wissowa suggested that Semo Sancus is the &quot;genius&quot; of Jupiter, but the concept of a deity&#x27;s &quot;genius&quot; is a development of the Imperial period.

Some aspects of the oath-ritual for Dius Fidius (such as proceedings under the open sky or in the &quot;compluvium&quot; of private residences), and the fact the temple of Sancus had no roof, suggest that the oath sworn by Dius Fidius predated that for &quot;Iuppiter Lapis&quot; or &quot;Iuppiter Feretrius&quot;.

=== Genius ===
Augustine quotes Varro who explains the &quot;genius&quot; as &quot;the god who is in charge and has the power to generate everything&quot; and &quot;the rational spirit of all (therefore, everyone has their own)&quot;. Augustine concludes that Jupiter should be considered the &quot;genius&quot; of the universe.

G. Wissowa advanced the hypothesis that Semo Sancus is the genius of Jupiter. W. W. Fowler has cautioned that this interpretation looks to be an anachronism and it would only be acceptable to say that Sancus is a &quot;Genius Iovius&quot;, as it appears from the Iguvine Tables.

Censorinus cites Granius Flaccus as saying that &quot;the Genius was the same entity as the Lar&quot; in his lost work &quot;De Indigitamentis&quot;. probably referring to the &quot;Lar Familiaris&quot;. Mutunus Tutunus had his shrine at the foot of the Velian Hill near those of the Di Penates and of Vica Pota, who were among the most ancient gods of the Roman community of according to Wissowa.

Dumézil opines that the attribution of a Genius to the gods should be earlier than its first attestation of 58 BC, in an inscription which mentions the &quot;Iovis Genius&quot;.

A connection between Genius and Jupiter seems apparent in Plautus&#x27; comedy &quot;Amphitryon&quot;, in which Jupiter takes up the looks of Alcmena&#x27;s husband in order to seduce her: J. Hubeaux sees there a reflection of the story that Scipio Africanus&#x27; mother conceived him with a snake that was in fact Jupiter transformed. Scipio himself claimed that only he would rise to the mansion of the gods through the widest gate.

Among the Etruscan &quot;Penates&quot; there is a &quot;Genius Iovialis&quot; who comes after &quot;Fortuna&quot; and &quot;Ceres&quot; and before &quot;Pales&quot;. Genius Iovialis is one of the &quot;Penates&quot; of the humans and not of Jupiter though, as these were located in region I of Martianus Capella&#x27; s division of Heaven, while Genius appears in regions V and VI along with Ceres, Favor (possibly a Roman approximation to an Etruscan male manifestation of Fortuna) and Pales. This is in accord with the definition of the Penates of man being Fortuna, Ceres, Pales and Genius Iovialis and the statement in Macrobius that the Larentalia were dedicated to Jupiter as the god whence the souls of men come from and to whom they return after death.

=== Summanus ===

The god of nighttime lightning has been interpreted as an aspect of Jupiter, either a chthonic manifestation of the god or a separate god of the underworld. A statue of Summanus stood on the roof of the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter, and &quot;Iuppiter Summanus&quot; is one of the epithets of Jupiter. Dumézil sees the opposition Dius Fidius versus Summanus as complementary, interpreting it as typical to the inherent ambiguity of the sovereign god exemplified by that of Mitra and Varuna in Vedic religion. The complementarity of the epithets is shown in inscriptions found on &quot;puteal&quot;s or &quot;bidental&quot;s reciting either &quot;fulgur Dium conditum&quot; or &quot;fulgur Summanum conditum&quot; in places struck by daytime versus nighttime lightning bolts respectively. This is also consistent with the etymology of &quot;Summanus&quot;, deriving from &quot;sub&quot; and &quot;mane&quot; (the time before morning).

=== Liber ===

&quot;Iuppiter&quot; was associated with Liber through his epithet of &quot;Liber&quot; (association not yet been fully explained by scholars, due to the scarcity of early documentation).
In the past, it was maintained that Liber was only a progressively-detached of Jupiter; consequently, the vintage festivals were to be attributed only to &quot;Iuppiter Liber&quot;. Such a hypothesis was rejected as groundless by Wissowa, although he was a supporter of Liber&#x27;s Jovian origin. Olivier de Cazanove contends that it is difficult to admit that Liber (who is present in the oldest calendars—those of Numa—in the &quot;Liberalia&quot; and in the month of &quot;Liber&quot; at Lavinium) was derived from another deity. Such a derivation would find support only in epigraphic documents, primarily from the Osco-Sabellic area. Wissowa sets the position of &quot;Iuppiter Liber&quot; within the framework of an agrarian Jupiter. The god also had a temple in this name on the Aventine in Rome, which was restored by Augustus and dedicated on 1 September. Here, the god was sometimes named &quot;Liber&quot; and sometimes &quot;Libertas&quot;. Wissowa opines that the relationship existed in the concept of creative abundance through which the supposedly-separate Liber might have been connected to the Greek god Dionysos, although both deities might not have been originally related to viticulture.

Other scholars assert that there was no Liber (other than a god of wine) within historical memory. Olivier de Cazanove argues that the domain of the sovereign god Jupiter was that of sacred, sacrificial wine (&quot;vinum inferium&quot;), while that of Liber and Libera was confined to secular wine (&quot;vinum spurcum&quot;); these two types were obtained through differing fermentation processes. The offer of wine to Liber was made possible by naming the &quot;mustum&quot; (grape juice) stored in amphoras &quot;sacrima&quot;.

Sacred wine was obtained by the natural fermentation of juice of grapes free from flaws of any type, religious (e. g. those struck by lightning, brought into contact with corpses or wounded people or coming from an unfertilised grapeyard) or secular (by &quot;cutting&quot; it with old wine). Secular (or &quot;profane&quot;) wine was obtained through several types of manipulation (e.g. by adding honey, or &quot;mulsum&quot;; using raisins, or &quot;passum&quot;; by boiling, or &quot;defrutum&quot;). However, the &quot;sacrima&quot; used for the offering to the two gods for the preservation of grapeyards, vessels and wine was obtained only by pouring the juice into amphors after pressing. The &quot;mustum&quot; was considered &quot;spurcum&quot; (dirty), and thus unusable in sacrifices. The amphor (itself not an item of sacrifice) permitted presentation of its content on a table or could be added to a sacrifice; this happened at the &quot;auspicatio vindamiae&quot; for the first grape and for ears of corn of the &quot;praemetium&quot; on a dish (&quot;lanx&quot;) at the temple of Ceres.

Dumézil, on the other hand, sees the relationship between Jupiter and Liber as grounded in the social and political relevance of the two gods (who were both considered patrons of freedom). The &quot;Liberalia&quot; of March were, since earliest times, the occasion for the ceremony of the donning of the &quot;toga virilis&quot; or &quot;libera&quot; (which marked the passage into adult citizenship by young people). Augustine relates that these festivals had a particularly obscene character: a &quot;phallus&quot; was taken to the fields on a cart, and then back in triumph to town. In Lavinium they lasted a month, during which the population enjoyed bawdy jokes. The most honest &quot;matronae&quot; were supposed to publicly crown the &quot;phallus&quot; with flowers, to ensure a good harvest and repeal the &quot;fascinatio&quot; (evil eye). In Rome representations of the sex organs were placed in the temple of the couple &quot;Liber Libera&quot;, who presided over the male and female components of generation and the &quot;liberation&quot; of the semen. This complex of rites and beliefs shows that the divine couple&#x27;s jurisdiction extended over fertility in general, not only that of grapes. The etymology of &quot;Liber&quot; (archaic form &quot;Loifer, Loifir&quot;) was explained by Émile Benveniste as formed on the IE theme *leudh- plus the suffix -es-; its original meaning is &quot;the one of germination, he who ensures the sprouting of crops&quot;.

The relationship of Jupiter with freedom was a common belief among the Roman people, as demonstrated by the dedication of the &quot;Mons Sacer&quot; to the god after the first secession of the &quot;plebs&quot;. Later inscriptions also show the unabated popular belief in Jupiter as bestower of freedom in the imperial era.

=== Veiove ===

Scholars have been often puzzled by Ve(d)iove (or Veiovis, or Vedius) and unwilling to discuss his identity, claiming our knowledge of this god is insufficient. Most, however, agree that Veiove is a sort of special Jupiter or anti-Iove, or even an underworld Jupiter. In other words, Veiove is indeed the Capitoline god himself, who takes up a different, diminished appearance (&quot;iuvenis&quot; and &quot;parvus&quot;, young and gracile), in order to be able to discharge sovereign functions over places, times and spheres that by their own nature are excluded from the direct control of Jupiter as Optimus Maximus. This conclusion is based on information provided by Gellius, who states his name is formed by adding prefix &quot;ve&quot; (here denoting &quot;deprivation&quot; or &quot;negation&quot;) to &quot;Iove &quot; (whose name Gellius posits as rooted in the verb &quot;iuvo&quot; &quot;I benefit&quot;). D. Sabbatucci has stressed the feature of bearer of instability and antithesis to cosmic order of the god, who threatens the kingly power of Jupiter as &quot;Stator&quot; and &quot;Centumpeda&quot; and whose presence occurs side by side to Janus&#x27; on 1 January, but also his function of helper to the growth of the young Jupiter. In 1858 Ludwig Preller suggested that Veiovis may be the sinister double of Jupiter.

The god (under the name &quot;Vetis&quot;) is placed in the last case (number 16) of the outer rim of the Piacenza Liver—before &quot;Cilens&quot; (Nocturnus), who ends (or begins in the Etruscan vision) the disposition of the gods. In Martianus Capella&#x27;s division of heaven, he is found in region XV with the &quot;dii publici&quot;; as such, he numbers among the infernal (or antipodal) gods. The location of his two temples in Rome—near those of Jupiter (one on the Capitoline Hill, in the low between the &quot;arx&quot; and the Capitolium, between the two groves where the asylum founded by Romulus stood, the other on the Tiber Island near that of &quot;Iuppiter Iurarius&quot;, later also known as temple of Aesculapius)—may be significant in this respect, along with the fact that he is considered the father of Apollo, perhaps because he was depicted carrying arrows. He is also considered to be the unbearded Jupiter. The dates of his festivals support the same conclusion: they fall on 1 January, 7 March and 21 May, the first date being the recurrence of the Agonalia, dedicated to Janus and celebrated by the king with the sacrifice of a ram. The nature of the sacrifice is debated; Gellius states &quot;capra&quot;, a female goat, although some scholars posit a ram. This sacrifice occurred &quot;rito humano&quot;, which may mean &quot;with the rite appropriate for human sacrifice&quot;. Gellius concludes by stating that this god is one of those who receive sacrifices so as to persuade them to refrain from causing harm.

The arrow is an ambivalent symbol; it was used in the ritual of the devotio (the general who vowed had to stand on an arrow). It is perhaps because of the arrow and of the juvenile looks that Gellius identifies Veiove with Apollo and as a god who must receive worship in order to obtain his abstention from harming men, along with Robigus and Averruncus. The ambivalence in the identity of Veiove is apparent in the fact that while he is present in places and times which may have a negative connotation (such as the &quot;asylum&quot; of Romulus in between the two groves on the Capitol, the Tiberine island along with Faunus and Aesculapius, the kalends of January, the nones of March, and 21 May, a statue of his nonetheless stands in the &quot;arx&quot;. Moreover, the initial particle &quot;ve-&quot; which the ancient supposed were part of his name is itself ambivalent as it may have both an accrescitive and diminutive value.

Maurice Besnier has remarked that a temple to &quot;Iuppiter&quot; was dedicated by &quot;praetor&quot; Lucius Furius Purpureo before the battle of Cremona against the Celtic Cenomani of Cisalpine Gaul. An inscription found at Brescia in 1888 shows that &quot;Iuppiter Iurarius&quot; was worshipped there and one found on the south tip of Tiber Island in 1854 that there was a cult to the god on the spot too. Besnier speculates that Lucius Furius had evoked the chief god of the enemy and built a temple to him in Rome outside the &quot;pomerium&quot;. On 1 January, the &quot;Fasti Praenestini&quot; record the festivals of Aesculapius and Vediove on the Island, while in the &quot;Fasti&quot; Ovid speaks of &quot;Jupiter&quot; and his grandson. Livy records that in 192 BC, &quot;duumvir&quot; Q. Marcus Ralla dedicated to Jupiter on the Capitol the two temples promised by L. Furius Purpureo, one of which was that promised during the war against the Gauls. Besnier would accept a correction to Livy&#x27;s passage (proposed by Jordan) to read &quot;aedes Veiovi&quot; instead of &quot;aedes duae Iovi&quot;. Such a correction concerns the temples dedicated on the Capitol: it does not address the question of the dedication of the temple on the Island, which is puzzling, since the place is attested epigraphically as dedicated to the cult of &quot;Iuppiter Iurarius&quot;, in the &quot;Fasti Praenestini&quot; of &quot;Vediove&quot; and to Jupiter according to Ovid. The two gods may have been seen as equivalent: &quot;Iuppiter Iurarius&quot; is an awesome and vengeful god, parallel to the Greek &quot;Zeus Orkios&quot;, the avenger of perjury.

A. Pasqualini has argued that Veiovis seems related to &quot;Iuppiter Latiaris&quot;, as the original figure of this Jupiter would have been superseded on the Alban Mount, whereas it preserved its gruesome character in the ceremony held on the sanctuary of the Latiar Hill, the southernmost hilltop of the Quirinal in Rome, which involved a human sacrifice. The gens Iulia had gentilician cults at Bovillae where a dedicatory inscription to Vediove has been found in 1826 on an ara. According to Pasqualini it was a deity similar to Vediove, wielder of lightningbolts and chthonic, who was connected to the cult of the founders who first inhabited the Alban Mount and built the sanctuary. Such a cult once superseded on the Mount would have been taken up and preserved by the Iulii, private citizens bound to the &quot;sacra Albana&quot; by their Alban origin.

=== Victoria ===
Victoria was connected to &quot;Iuppiter Victor&quot; in his role as bestower of military victory. Jupiter, as a sovereign god, was considered as having the power to conquer anyone and anything in a supernatural way; his contribution to military victory was different from that of Mars (god of military valour). Victoria appears first on the reverse of coins representing Venus (driving the quadriga of Jupiter, with her head crowned and with a palm in her hand) during the first Punic War. Sometimes, she is represented walking and carrying a trophy.

A temple was dedicated to the goddess afterwards on the Palatine, testifying to her high station in the Roman mind. When Hieron of Syracuse presented a golden statuette of the goddess to Rome, the Senate had it placed in the temple of Capitoline Jupiter among the greatest (and most sacred) deities.

Although Victoria played a significant role in the religious ideology of the late Republic and the Empire, she is undocumented in earlier times. A function similar to hers may have been played by the little-known Vica Pota.

=== Terminus ===

Juventas and Terminus were the gods who, according to legend, refused to leave their sites on the Capitol when the construction of the temple of Jupiter was undertaken. Therefore, they had to be reserved a &quot;sacellum&quot; within the new temple. Their stubbornness was considered a good omen; it would guarantee youth, stability and safety to Rome on its site. This legend is generally thought by scholars to indicate their strict connection with Jupiter. An inscription found near Ravenna reads &quot;Iuppiter Ter.&quot;, indicating that Terminus is an aspect of Jupiter.

Terminus is the god of boundaries (public and private), as he is portrayed in literature. The religious value of the boundary marker is documented by Plutarch, who ascribes to king Numa the construction of temples to Fides and Terminus and the delimitation of Roman territory. Ovid gives a vivid description of the rural rite at a boundary of fields of neighbouring peasants on 23 February (the day of the Terminalia. On that day, Roman pontiffs and magistrates held a ceremony at the sixth mile of the Via Laurentina (ancient border of the Roman &quot;ager&quot;, which maintained a religious value). This festival, however, marked the end of the year and was linked to time more directly than to space (as attested by Augustine&#x27;s apologia on the role of Janus with respect to endings). Dario Sabbatucci has emphasised the temporal affiliation of Terminus, a reminder of which is found in the rite of the &quot;regifugium&quot;. Dumézil, on the other hand, views the function of this god as associated with the legalistic aspect of the sovereign function of Jupiter. Terminus would be the counterpart of the minor Vedic god Bagha, who oversees the just and fair division of goods among citizens.

=== Iuventas ===
Along with &quot;Terminus&quot;, &quot; Iuventas&quot; (also known as &quot;Iuventus&quot; and &quot;Iuunta&quot;) represents an aspect of Jupiter (as the legend of her refusal to leave the Capitol Hill demonstrates. Her name has the same root as Juno (from &quot;Iuu-&quot;, &quot;young, youngster&quot;); the ceremonial litter bearing the sacred goose of Juno Moneta stopped before her &quot;sacellum&quot; on the festival of the goddess. Later, she was identified with the Greek Hebe. The fact that Jupiter is related to the concept of youth is shown by his epithets &quot;Puer&quot;, &quot;Iuuentus&quot; and &quot;Ioviste&quot; (interpreted as &quot;the youngest&quot; by some scholars). Dumézil noted the presence of the two minor sovereign deities Bagha and Aryaman beside the Vedic sovereign gods Varuna and Mitra (though more closely associated with Mitra); the couple would be reflected in Rome by &quot;Terminus&quot; and &quot;Iuventas&quot;. Aryaman is the god of young soldiers. The function of &quot;Iuventas&quot; is to protect the &quot;iuvenes&quot; (the &quot;novi togati&quot; of the year, who are required to offer a sacrifice to Jupiter on the Capitol) and the Roman soldiers (a function later attributed to Juno). King Servius Tullius, in reforming the Roman social organisation, required that every adolescent offer a coin to the goddess of youth upon entering adulthood.

In Dumézil&#x27;s analysis, the function of &quot;Iuventas&quot; (the personification of youth), was to control the entrance of young men into society and protect them until they reach the age of &quot;iuvenes&quot; or &quot;iuniores&quot; (i.e. of serving the state as soldiers).

A temple to &quot;Iuventas&quot; was promised in 207 BC by consul Marcus Livius Salinator and dedicated in 191 BC.

=== Penates ===

The Romans considered the Penates as the gods to whom they owed their own existence. As noted by Wissowa &quot;Penates&quot; is an adjective, meaning &quot;those of or from the &quot;penus&quot;&quot; the innermost part, most hidden recess; Dumézil though refuses Wissowa&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;penus&quot; as the storeroom of a household. As a nation the Romans honoured the &quot;Penates publici&quot;: Dionysius calls them &quot;Trojan gods&quot; as they were absorbed into the Trojan legend. They had a temple in Rome at the foot of the Velian Hill, near the Palatine, in which they were represented as a couple of male youth. They were honoured every year by the new consuls before entering office at Lavinium, because the Romans believed the Penates of that town were identical to their own.

The concept of &quot;di Penates&quot; is more defined in Etruria: Arnobius (citing a Caesius) states that the Etruscan Penates were named Fortuna, Ceres, Genius Iovialis and Pales; according to Nigidius Figulus, they included those of Jupiter, of Neptune, of the infernal gods and of mortal men. According to Varro the Penates reside in the recesses of Heaven and are called &quot;Consentes&quot; and &quot;Complices&quot; by the Etruscans because they rise and set together, are twelve in number and their names are unknown, six male and six females and are the cousellors and masters of Jupiter. Martianus states they are always in agreement among themselves. While these last gods seem to be the Penates of Jupiter, Jupiter himself along with Juno and Minerva is one of the Penates of man according to some authors.

This complex concept is reflected in Martianus Capella&#x27;s division of heaven, found in Book I of his &quot;De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae&quot;, which places the &quot;Di Consentes Penates&quot; in region I with the &quot;Favores Opertanei&quot;; &quot;Ceres&quot; and &quot;Genius&quot; in region V; &quot;Pales&quot; in region VI; &quot;Favor&quot; and &quot;Genius&quot; (again) in region VII; &quot;Secundanus Pales&quot;, &quot;Fortuna&quot; and &quot;Favor Pastor&quot; in region XI. The disposition of these divine entities and their repetition in different locations may be due to the fact that &quot;Penates&quot; belonging to different categories (of Jupiter in region I, earthly or of mortal men in region V) are intended. &quot;Favor(es)&quot; may be the Etruscan masculine equivalent of &quot;Fortuna&quot;.

<text>In computing, a trusted client is a device or program controlled by the user of a service, but with restrictions designed to prevent its use in ways not authorized by the provider of the service. That is, the client is a device that vendors trust and then sell to the consumers, whom they do not trust. Examples include video games played over a computer network or the Content Scramble System (CSS) in DVDs.

Trusted client software is considered fundamentally insecure: once the security is broken by one user, the break is trivially copyable and available to others. As computer security specialist Bruce Schneier states, &quot;Against the average user, anything works; there&#x27;s no need for complex security software. Against the skilled attacker, on the other hand, nothing works.&quot; Trusted client hardware is somewhat more secure, but not a complete solution.

Trusted clients are attractive to business as a form of vendor lock-in: sell the trusted client at a loss and charge more than would be otherwise economically viable for the associated service. One early example was radio receivers that were subsidized by broadcasters, but restricted to receiving only their radio station. Modern examples include video recorders being forced by law to include Macrovision copy protection, the DVD region code system and region-coded video game consoles.

Trusted computing aims to create computer hardware which assists in the implementation of such restrictions in software, and attempts to make circumvention of these restrictions more difficult.

<doc id="40258" wikidata="Q184421" url="?curid=40258" title="Harmony">
<text>In music, harmony is the concept of combining different sounds in order to create new, distinct musical ideas. Theories of harmony seek to describe or explain the effects created by distinct pitches or tones coinciding with one another; harmonic objects such as chords, textures and tonalities are identified, defined, and categorized in the development of these theories. Harmony is broadly understood to involve both a &quot;vertical&quot; dimension (frequency-space) and a &quot;horizontal&quot; dimension (time-space), and often overlaps with related musical concepts such as melody, timbre, and form.

A particular emphasis on harmony is one of the core concepts underlying the theory and practice of Western music. The study of harmony involves the juxtaposition of individual pitches to create chords, and in turn the juxtaposition of chords to create larger chord progressions. The principles of connection that govern these structures have been the subject of centuries worth of theoretical work and vernacular practice alike.

Drawing both from music theoretical traditions and the field of psychoacoustics, its perception in large part consists of recognizing and processing consonance, a concept whose precise definition has varied throughout history, but is often associated with simple mathematical ratios between coincident pitch frequencies. In the physiological approach, consonance is viewed as a continuous variable measuring the human brain&#x27;s ability to &#x27;decode&#x27; aural sensory input. Culturally, &quot;consonant&quot; pitch relationships are often described as sounding more pleasant, euphonious, and beautiful than &quot;dissonant&quot; pitch relationships, which can be conversely characterized as unpleasant, discordant, or rough.

In popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with &quot;tensions&quot;. A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass. The notion of counterpoint seeks to understand and describe the relationships between melodic lines, often in the context of a polyphonic texture of several simultaneous but independent voices. Therefore, it is sometimes seen as a type of harmonic understanding, and sometimes distinguished from harmony. 

Typically, in the classical common practice period, a dissonant chord (chord with tension) &quot;resolves&quot; to a consonant chord. Harmonization usually sounds pleasant when there is a balance between consonance and dissonance. This occurs when there is a balance between &quot;tense&quot; and &quot;relaxed&quot; moments. Dissonance is an important part of harmony when it can be resolved and contribute to the composition of music as a whole. A misplayed note or any sound that is judged to detract from the whole composition can be described as disharmonious rather than dissonant.

== Etymology and definitions==
The term &quot;harmony&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;harmonia&quot;, meaning &quot;joint, agreement, concord&quot;, from the verb &quot;harmozō&quot;, &quot;(Ι) fit together, join&quot;. Aristoxenus wrote a work entitled &quot;Elements of Harmony&quot;, which is thought the first work in European history written on the subject of harmony. In this book, Aristoxenus refers to previous experiments conducted by Pythagoreans to determine the relationship between small integer ratios and consonant notes (e.g., 1:2 describes an octave relationship, which is a doubling of frequency). While identifying as a Pythagorean, Aristoxenus claims that numerical ratios are not the ultimate determinant of harmony; instead, he claims that the listener&#x27;s ear determines harmony.

Current dictionary definitions, while attempting to give concise descriptions, often highlight the ambiguity of the term in modern use. Ambiguities tend to arise from either aesthetic considerations (for example the view that only pleasing concords may be harmonious) or from the point of view of musical texture (distinguishing between harmonic (simultaneously sounding pitches) and &quot;contrapuntal&quot; (successively sounding tones)). According to A. Whittall:

The view that modern tonal harmony in Western music began in about 1600 is commonplace in music theory. This is usually accounted for by the replacement of horizontal (or contrapuntal) composition, common in the music of the Renaissance, with a new emphasis on the vertical element of composed music. Modern theorists, however, tend to see this as an unsatisfactory generalisation. According to Carl Dahlhaus:

Descriptions and definitions of harmony and harmonic practice often show bias towards European (or Western) musical traditions, although many cultures practice vertical harmony. In addition, South Asian art music (Hindustani and Carnatic music) is frequently cited as placing little emphasis on what is perceived in western practice as conventional harmony; the underlying harmonic foundation for most South Asian music is the drone, a held open fifth interval (or fourth interval) that does not alter in pitch throughout the course of a composition. Pitch simultaneity in particular is rarely a major consideration. Nevertheless, many other considerations of pitch are relevant to the music, its theory and its structure, such as the complex system of Ragas, which combines both melodic and modal considerations and codifications within it.

So, intricate pitch combinations that sound simultaneously do occur in Indian classical music – but they are rarely studied as teleological harmonic or contrapuntal progressions – as with notated Western music. This contrasting emphasis (with regard to Indian music in particular) manifests itself in the different methods of performance adopted: in Indian Music, improvisation takes a major role in the structural framework of a piece, whereas in Western Music improvisation has been uncommon since the end of the 19th century. Where it does occur in Western music (or has in the past), the improvisation either embellishes pre-notated music or draws from musical models previously established in notated compositions, and therefore uses familiar harmonic schemes.

Emphasis on the precomposed in European art music and the written theory surrounding it shows considerable cultural bias. The &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; (Oxford University Press) identifies this clearly:

Yet the evolution of harmonic practice and language itself, in Western art music, is and was facilitated by this process of prior composition, which permitted the study and analysis by theorists and composers of individual pre-constructed works in which pitches (and to some extent rhythms) remained unchanged regardless of the nature of the performance.

== Historical rules ==

Early Western religious music often features parallel perfect intervals; these intervals would preserve the clarity of the original plainsong. These works were created and performed in cathedrals, and made use of the resonant modes of their respective cathedrals to create harmonies. As polyphony developed, however, the use of parallel intervals was slowly replaced by the English style of consonance that used thirds and sixths. The English style was considered to have a sweeter sound, and was better suited to polyphony in that it offered greater linear flexibility in part-writing.

== Types ==

Carl Dahlhaus (1990) distinguishes between &quot;coordinate&quot; and &quot;subordinate harmony&quot;. &quot;Subordinate harmony&quot; is the hierarchical tonality or tonal harmony well known today. &quot;Coordinate harmony&quot; is the older Medieval and Renaissance &quot;tonalité ancienne&quot;, &quot;The term is meant to signify that sonorities are linked one after the other without giving rise to the impression of a goal-directed development. A first chord forms a &#x27;progression&#x27; with a second chord, and a second with a third. But the former chord progression is independent of the later one and vice versa.&quot; Coordinate harmony follows direct (adjacent) relationships rather than indirect as in subordinate. Interval cycles create symmetrical harmonies, which have been extensively used by the composers Alban Berg, George Perle, Arnold Schoenberg, Béla Bartók, and Edgard Varèse&#x27;s &quot;Density 21.5&quot;.

Close harmony and open harmony use close position and open position chords, respectively. See: Voicing (music) and Close and open harmony.

Other types of harmony are based upon the intervals of the chords used in that harmony. Most chords in western music are based on &quot;tertian&quot; harmony, or chords built with the interval of thirds. In the chord C Major7, C–E is a major third; E–G is a minor third; and G to B is a major third. Other types of harmony consist of quartal and quintal harmony.

A unison is considered a harmonic interval, just like a fifth or a third, but is unique in that it is two identical notes produced together. The unison, as a component of harmony, is important, especially in orchestration. In pop music, unison singing is usually called &quot;doubling&quot;, a technique The Beatles used in many of their earlier recordings. As a type of harmony, singing in unison or playing the same notes, often using different musical instruments, at the same time is commonly called monophonic harmonization.

== Intervals ==
An interval is the relationship between two separate musical pitches. For example, in the melody &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot;, between the first two notes (the first &quot;twinkle&quot;) and the second two notes (the second &quot;twinkle&quot;) is the interval of a fifth. What this means is that if the first two notes were the pitch C, the second two notes would be the pitch G—four scale notes, or seven chromatic notes (a perfect fifth), above it.

The following are common intervals:

When tuning notes using an equal temperament, such as the 12-tone equal temperament that has become ubiquitous in Western music, each interval is created using steps of the same size, producing harmonic relations marginally &#x27;out of tune&#x27; from pure frequency ratios as explored by the ancient Greeks. 12-tone equal temperament evolved as a compromise from earlier systems where all intervals were calculated relative to a chosen root frequency, such as just intonation and well temperament. In those systems, a major third constructed up from C did not produce the same frequency as a minor third constructed up from D♭. Many keyboard and fretted instruments were constructed with the ability to play, for example, both of G♯ &quot;and&quot; A♭ without retuning. The notes of these pairs (even those where one lacks an accidental, such as E and F♭) were not the &#x27;same&#x27; note in any sense.

Using the diatonic scale, constructing the major and minor keys with each of the 12 notes as the tonic can be achieved using only flats &quot;or&quot; sharps to spell notes within said key, never both. This is often visualized as traveling around the circle of fifths, with each step only involving a change in one note&#x27;s accidental. As such, additional accidentals are free to convey more nuanced information in the context of a passage of music and the other notes that make it up. Even when working outside diatonic contexts, it is convention, if possible, to use each letter in the alphabet only once in describing a scale.

A note spelled as F♭ conveys different harmonic information to the reader versus a note spelled as E. In a tuning system where two notes spelled differently are tuned to the same frequency, those notes are said to be enharmonic. Even if identical in isolation, different spellings of enharmonic notes provide meaningful context when reading and analyzing music. For example, even though E and F♭ are enharmonic, the former is considered to be a major third up from C, while F♭ is considered to be a diminished fourth up from C. In the context of a C major tonality, the former is the third of the scale, while the latter could (as one of numerous possible justifications) be serving the harmonic function of the third of a D♭ minor chord, a borrowed chord within the scale.

Therefore, the combination of notes with their specific intervals—a chord—creates harmony. For example, in a C chord, there are three notes: C, E, and G. The note C is the root. The notes E and G provide harmony, and in a G7 (G dominant 7th) chord, the root G with each subsequent note (in this case B, D and F) provide the harmony.
In the musical scale, there are twelve pitches. Each pitch is referred to as a &quot;degree&quot; of the scale. The names A, B, C, D, E, F, and G are insignificant. The intervals, however, are not. Here is an example:

As can be seen, no note will always be the same scale degree. The &quot;tonic&quot;, or first-degree note, can be any of the 12 notes (pitch classes) of the chromatic scale. All the other notes fall into place. For example, when C is the tonic, the fourth degree or subdominant is F. When D is the tonic, the fourth degree is G. While the note names remain constant, they may refer to different scale degrees, implying different intervals with respect to the tonic. The great power of this fact is that any musical work can be played or sung in any key. It is the same piece of music, as long as the intervals are the same—thus transposing the melody into the corresponding key. When the intervals surpass the perfect Octave (12 semitones), these intervals are called &quot;compound intervals&quot;, which include particularly the 9th, 11th, and 13th Intervals—widely used in jazz and blues Music.

Compound Intervals are formed and named as follows:
*2nd + Octave = 9th
*3rd + Octave = 10th
*4th + Octave = 11th
*5th + Octave = 12th
*6th + Octave = 13th
*7th + Octave = 14th

These numbers don&#x27;t &quot;add&quot; together because intervals are numbered inclusive of the root note (e.g. one tone up is a 2nd), so the root is counted twice by adding them. Apart from this categorization, intervals can also be divided into consonant and dissonant. As explained in the following paragraphs, consonant intervals produce a sensation of relaxation and dissonant intervals a sensation of tension. In tonal music, the term consonant also means &quot;brings resolution&quot; (to some degree at least, whereas dissonance &quot;requires resolution&quot;).

The consonant intervals are considered the perfect unison, octave, fifth, fourth and major and minor third and sixth, and their compound forms. An interval is referred to as &quot;perfect&quot; when the harmonic relationship is found in the natural overtone series (namely, the unison 1:1, octave 2:1, fifth 3:2, and fourth 4:3). The other basic intervals (second, third, sixth, and seventh) are called &quot;imperfect&quot; because the harmonic relationships are not found mathematically exact in the overtone series. In classical music the perfect fourth above the bass may be considered dissonant when its function is contrapuntal. Other intervals, the second and the seventh (and their compound forms) are considered Dissonant and require resolution (of the produced tension) and usually preparation (depending on the music style).

The effect of dissonance is perceived relatively within musical context: for example, a major seventh interval alone (i.e., C up to B) may be perceived as dissonant, but the same interval as part of a major seventh chord may sound relatively consonant. A tritone (the interval of the fourth step to the seventh step of the major scale, i.e., F to B) sounds very dissonant alone, but less so within the context of a dominant seventh chord (G7 or D7 in that example).

== Chords and tension ==

In the Western tradition, in music after the seventeenth century, harmony is manipulated using chords, which are combinations of pitch classes. In tertian harmony, so named after the interval of a third, the members of chords are found and named by stacking intervals of the third, starting with the &quot;root&quot;, then the &quot;third&quot; above the root, and the &quot;fifth&quot; above the root (which is a third above the third), etc. (Chord members are named after their interval above the root.) Dyads, the simplest chords, contain only two members (see power chords).

A chord with three members is called a triad because it has three members, not because it is necessarily built in thirds (see Quartal and quintal harmony for chords built with other intervals). Depending on the size of the intervals being stacked, different qualities of chords are formed. In popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. To keep the nomenclature as simple as possible, some defaults are accepted (not tabulated here). For example, the chord members C, E, and G, form a C Major triad, called by default simply a C chord. In an A chord (pronounced A-flat), the members are A, C, and E.

In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern and jazz, chords are often augmented with &quot;tensions&quot;. A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass. Following the tertian practice of building chords by stacking thirds, the simplest first tension is added to a triad by stacking, on top of the existing root, third, and fifth, another third above the fifth, adding a new, potentially dissonant member a seventh away from the root (called the &quot;seventh&quot; of the chord) producing a four-note chord called a &quot;seventh chord&quot;.

Depending on the widths of the individual thirds stacked to build the chord, the interval between the root and the seventh of the chord may be major, minor, or diminished. (The interval of an augmented seventh reproduces the root, and is therefore left out of the chordal nomenclature.) The nomenclature allows that, by default, &quot;C7&quot; indicates a chord with a root, third, fifth, and seventh spelled C, E, G, and B. Other types of seventh chords must be named more explicitly, such as &quot;C Major 7&quot; (spelled C, E, G, B), &quot;C augmented 7&quot; (here the word augmented applies to the fifth, not the seventh, spelled C, E, G, B), etc. (For a more complete exposition of nomenclature see Chord (music).)

Continuing to stack thirds on top of a seventh chord produces extensions, and brings in the &quot;extended tensions&quot; or &quot;upper tensions&quot; (those more than an octave above the root when stacked in thirds), the ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths. This creates the chords named after them. (Except for dyads and triads, tertian chord types are named for the interval of the largest size and magnitude in use in the stack, not for the number of chord members : thus a ninth chord has five members &quot;[tonic, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th]&quot;, not nine.) Extensions beyond the thirteenth reproduce existing chord members and are (usually) left out of the nomenclature. Complex harmonies based on extended chords are found in abundance in jazz, late-romantic music, modern orchestral works, film music, etc.

Typically, in the classical common practice period a dissonant chord (chord with tension) &quot;resolves&quot; to a consonant chord. Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between &quot;tense&quot; and &quot;relaxed&quot; moments. For this reason, usually tension is &#x27;prepared&#x27; and then &#x27;resolved&#x27;, where preparing tension means to place a series of consonant chords that lead smoothly to the dissonant chord. In this way the composer ensures introducing tension smoothly, without disturbing the listener. Once the piece reaches its sub-climax, the listener needs a moment of relaxation to clear up the tension, which is obtained by playing a consonant chord that resolves the tension of the previous chords. The clearing of this tension usually sounds pleasant to the listener, though this is not always the case in late-nineteenth century music, such as &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; by Richard Wagner.

== Perception ==
A number of features contribute to the perception of a chord&#x27;s harmony.

=== Tonal fusion ===
Tonal fusion contributes to the perceived consonance of a chord, describing the degree to which multiple pitches are heard as a single, unitary tone. Chords which have more coinciding partials (frequency components) are perceived as more consonant, such as the octave and perfect fifth. The spectra of these intervals resemble that of a uniform tone. According to this definition, a major triad fuses better than a minor triad and a major-minor seventh chord fuses better than a major-major seventh or minor-minor seventh. These differences may not be readily apparent in tempered contexts but can explain why major triads are generally more prevalent than minor triads and major-minor sevenths are generally more prevalent than other sevenths (in spite of the dissonance of the tritone interval) in mainstream tonal music.

In organ registers, certain harmonic interval combinations and chords are activated by a single key. The sounds produced fuse into one tone with a new timbre. This tonal fusion effect is also used in synthesizers and orchestral arrangements; for instance, in Ravel&#x27;s Bolero #5 the parallel parts of flutes, horn and celesta resemble the sound of an electric organ.

=== Roughness ===
When adjacent harmonics in complex tones interfere with one another, they create the perception of what is known as &quot;beating&quot; or &quot;roughness&quot;. These precepts are closely related to the perceived dissonance of chords. To interfere, partials must lie within a critical bandwidth, which is a measure of the ear&#x27;s ability to separate different frequencies. Critical bandwidth lies between 2 and 3 semitones at high frequencies and becomes larger at lower frequencies. The roughest interval in the chromatic scale is the minor second and its inversion, the major seventh. For typical spectral envelopes in the central range, the second roughest interval is the major second and minor seventh, followed by the tritone, the minor third (major sixth), the major third (minor sixth) and the perfect fourth (fifth).

=== Familiarity ===
Familiarity also contributes to the perceived harmony of an interval. Chords that have often been heard in musical contexts tend to sound more consonant. This principle explains the gradual historical increase in harmonic complexity of Western music. For example, around 1600 unprepared seventh chords gradually became familiar and were therefore gradually perceived as more consonant.

Individual characteristics such as age and musical experience also have an effect on harmony perception.

===Neural correlates of harmony===
The inferior colliculus is a mid-brain structure which is the first site of binaural auditory integration, processing auditory information from the left and right ears. Frequency following responses (FFRs) recorded from the mid-brain exhibit peaks in activity which correspond to the frequency components of a tonal stimulus. The extent to which FFRs accurately represent the harmonic information of a chord is called neural salience, and this value is correlated with behavioral ratings of the perceived pleasantness of chords.

In response to harmonic intervals, cortical activity also distinguishes chords by their consonance, responding more robustly to chords with greater consonance.

<text>Harthacnut (; &quot;Tough-knot&quot;;  – 8 June 1042), traditionally Hardicanute, sometimes referred to as Canute III, was King of Denmark from 1035 to 1042 and King of England from 1040 to 1042.

Harthacnut was the son of King Cnut the Great (who ruled Denmark, Norway, and England) and Emma of Normandy. When Cnut died in 1035, Harthacnut struggled to retain his father&#x27;s possessions. Magnus I took control of Norway, but Harthacnut succeeded as King of Denmark and became King of England in 1040 after the death of his half-brother Harold Harefoot, king of England. Harthacnut himself died suddenly in 1042 and was succeeded by Magnus in Denmark and Edward the Confessor in England. Harthacnut was the last Dane to rule England.

== Early life ==
Harthacnut was born shortly after the marriage of his parents in July or August 1017. Cnut had put aside his first wife Ælfgifu of Northampton to marry Emma, and according to the &quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot;, a book she inspired many years later, Cnut agreed that any sons of their marriage should take precedence over the sons of his first marriage. In 1023, Emma and Harthacnut played a leading role in the translation of the body of the martyr St Ælfheah from London to Canterbury, an occasion seen by Harthacnut&#x27;s biographer, Ian Howard, as recognition of his position as Cnut&#x27;s heir in England.

In the 1020s, Denmark was threatened by Norway and Sweden, and in 1026 Cnut decided to strengthen its defences by bringing over his eight-year-old son to be the future king under a council headed by his brother-in-law, Earl Ulf. Ulf alienated Cnut by getting the Danish provinces to acknowledge Harthacnut as king without reference to Cnut&#x27;s overall authority and by failing to take vigorous measures to meet Norwegian and Swedish invasions, instead waiting for Cnut&#x27;s assistance. In 1027, Cnut arrived with a fleet. He forgave Harthacnut his insubordination in view of his youth but had Ulf murdered. He drove the invaders out of Denmark and established his authority over Norway, returning to England in 1028 and leaving Denmark to be ruled by King Harthacnut.

Cnut had left Norway under the rule of Håkon Eiriksson, who drowned in a shipwreck in 1029 or 1030. Cnut then appointed his son Svein to rule Norway with the assistance of Ælfgifu, Cnut&#x27;s first wife and Svein&#x27;s mother. They made themselves unpopular by heavy taxation and favouring Danish advisers over the Norwegian nobles, and when King Magnus I of Norway, the son of the former King of Norway, Olaf, invaded in 1035, they were forced to flee to Harthacnut&#x27;s court. Harthacnut was a close ally of Svein, but he did not feel his resources were great enough to launch an invasion of Norway, and the half-brothers looked for help from their father, but instead they received news of his death in November 1035.

== Reign ==
=== Harold and Denmark ===
In 1035, Harthacnut succeeded his father on the throne of Denmark as Cnut III. He was unable to come to England in view of the situation in Denmark, and it was agreed that Svein&#x27;s full brother, Harold Harefoot, should act as regent, with Emma holding Wessex on Harthacnut&#x27;s behalf. In 1037, Harold was generally accepted as king, Harthacnut being, in the words of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, &quot;forsaken because he was too long in Denmark&quot;, while Emma fled to Bruges, in Flanders. In 1039, Harthacnut sailed with ten ships to meet his mother in Bruges but delayed an invasion as it was clear Harold was sick and would soon die, which he did in March 1040. Envoys soon crossed the channel to offer Harthacnut the throne.

While the general outline of events following Cnut&#x27;s death is clear, the details are obscure, and historians give differing interpretations. The historian M. K. Lawson states that it is unclear whether Harthacnut was to have England as well as Denmark, but it was probably a reflection of a formal arrangement that mints south of the Thames produced silver pennies in his name, while those to the north were almost all Harold&#x27;s. There might have been a division of the kingdom if Harthacnut had appeared straight away. He probably stayed in Denmark because of the threat from Magnus of Norway, but they eventually made a treaty by which if either died without an heir, his kingdom would go to the other, and this may have freed Harthacnut to pursue his claim to England.

According to Ian Howard, Harthacnut agreed to help Svein recover Norway and planned an invasion in 1036. Svein died shortly before it was to set out, but Harthacnut proceeded anyway. War was avoided by the treaty between Harthacnut and Magnus, which Harthacnut agreed to because he had no plausible candidate to rule Norway after Svein&#x27;s death, and he was in any case temperamentally inclined to avoid campaigns and wars. Howard dates the treaty to 1036, whereas other historians date it to 1039 and believe it freed Harthacnut to launch an invasion of England.

Exiled in Bruges, Emma plotted to gain the English throne for her son. She sponsored the &quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot;, which eulogised her and attacked Harold, especially for arranging the murder of Alfred Atheling (the younger of Emma&#x27;s two sons by Æthelred) in 1036. The work describes Harthacnut&#x27;s horror at hearing of his half brother&#x27;s murder, and in Howard&#x27;s view, was probably influential in finally persuading the cautious Harthacnut to invade England. According to a later edition of the &quot;Encomium&quot;, the English took the initiative in communicating with Harthacnut in 1039, possibly when they became aware that Harold had not long to live.

=== Return to England ===

Harthacnut travelled to England with his mother. The landing at Sandwich on 17 June 1040, &quot;seven days before Midsummer&quot;, was a peaceful one, though he had a fleet of 62 warships. Even though he had been invited to take the throne, he was taking no chances and came as a conqueror with an invasion force. The crews had to be rewarded for their service, and to pay them, he levied a geld of more than 21,000 pounds, a huge sum of money that made him unpopular, although it was only a quarter of the amount his father had raised in similar circumstances in 1017–1018.

Harthacnut had been horrified by Harold&#x27;s murder of Alfred, and his mother demanded vengeance. With the approval of Harold&#x27;s former councillors, his body was disinterred from its place of honour at Westminster and publicly beheaded. It was disposed of in a sewer, but then retrieved and thrown in the Thames, from which London shipmen rescued it and had it buried in a churchyard. Godwin, the powerful earl of Wessex, had been complicit in the crime as he had handed over Alfred to Harold, and Queen Emma charged him in a trial before Harthacnut and members of his council. The king allowed Godwin to escape punishment by bringing witnesses that he had acted on Harold&#x27;s orders, but Godwin then gave Harthacnut a ship so richly decorated that it amounted to the wergild that Godwin would have had to pay if he had been found guilty. Bishop Lyfing of Worcester was also charged with complicity in the crime and deprived of his see, but in 1041 he made his peace with Harthacnut and was restored to his position.

The English had become used to the king ruling in council, with the advice of his chief men, but Harthacnut had ruled autocratically in Denmark, and he was not willing to change, particularly as he did not fully trust the leading earls. At first he was successful intimidating his subjects, though less so later in his short reign. He doubled the size of the English fleet from sixteen to thirty-two ships, partly so that he had a force capable of dealing with trouble elsewhere in his empire, and to pay for it he severely increased the rate of taxation. The increase coincided with a poor harvest, causing severe hardship. In 1041, two of his tax gatherers were so harsh in dealing with people in and around Worcester that they rioted and killed the tax gatherers. Harthacnut reacted by imposing a then-legal but very unpopular punishment known as &quot;harrying&quot;. He ordered his earls to burn the town and kill the population. Few people were killed, as the people of Worcester had fled in advance of their arrival. Although the city was burnt and plundered, citizens of Worcester who had taken refuge on an island in the River Severn fought successfully against Harthacnut&#x27;s troops, and won the right to return to their homes without further punishment.

The earl of Northumbria was Siward, but Earl Eadwulf of Bamburgh ruled the northern part in semi-independence, a situation which did not please the autocratic Harthacnut. In 1041, Earl Eadwulf gave offence to the king for an unknown reason but then sought reconciliation. Harthacnut promised him safe conduct but then colluded in his murder by Siward, who became earl of the whole of Northumbria. The crime was widely condemned, and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; described it as &quot;a betrayal&quot; and the king as an &quot;oath-breaker&quot;.

Harthacnut was generous to the church. Very few contemporary documents survive, but a royal charter of his transferred land to Bishop Ælfwine of Winchester, and he made several grants to Ramsey Abbey. The 12th century &quot;Ramsey Chronicle&quot; speaks well of his generosity and of his character.

== Death ==
Harthacnut had suffered from bouts of illness even before he became King of England. He may have suffered from tuberculosis, and he probably knew that he had not long to live. In 1041, he invited his half-brother Edward the Confessor (his mother Emma&#x27;s son by Æthelred the Unready) back from exile in Normandy and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; says that Edward was sworn in as king. Lawson comments: &quot;This may mean that Edward was recognized as heir of Harthacnut, who had neither wife nor children, and who is said by the slightly later Norman historian William of Poitiers to have suffered from frequent illness. The likely truth of this is suggested not only by his sudden death the following year, but also because it is otherwise difficult to see why a man in his early twenties with a normal life expectancy should have acted so.&quot; He may well have been influenced by Emma, who hoped to keep her power by ensuring that one of her sons was succeeded by another. The historian John Maddicott comments that Harthacnut must have sanctioned Edward&#x27;s return and may have promoted it, but Tom Licence disagrees and suggests that Edward was summoned to England by the leading magnates because they had lost confidence in Harthacnut and forced Edward on him. Licence comments that no contemporary source says that Harthacnut was dying.

On 8 June 1042, Harthacnut attended a wedding in Lambeth. The groom was Tovi the Proud, and the bride was Gytha, daughter of Osgod Clapa. Both men had been close to Cnut. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Harthacnut died as he stood at his drink, and he suddenly fell to the earth with an awful convulsion; and those who were close by took hold of him, and he spoke no word afterwards&quot;. In Licence&#x27;s view, the death was not that of a sick man.

== Succession ==
The political agreement between Harthacnut and Magnus the Good included the appointment of the latter as heir to Harthacnut. At the time, the agreement would have only affected the throne of Denmark. The &quot;Heimskringla&quot; reports that when Harthacnut died, Magnus extended his claim to England. He reportedly sent a letter to Edward the Confessor, pressing his claim to the English throne and threatening invasion. His own heir, Harald Hardrada, would also press this claim. Both considered themselves legal heirs to Harthacnut. The &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; contains a scene where Magnus proclaims: &quot;I will take possession of all the Danish empire or else die in the attempt.&quot;

According to the &quot;Encomium&quot;, Edward the Confessor already served as co-ruler of England since 1041. There is an emphasis on Harthacnut, Edward, and Emma serving as a trinity of rulers, in emulation of the Holy Trinity. Edward, by surviving his co-ruler, would be king by default. The &quot;Heimskringla&quot; depicts Edward portraying himself as brother and legal heir to both Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut, while pointing out that he had already won the support &quot;of all the people of the country&quot;. Unstated in both is that the marriage of Edward to Edith of Wessex would also support his claim by earning him both the political support of her father Godwin and an additional connection to Cnut. She was a niece to the king. The &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; has Edward point out that he was the son of Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy, the half-brother to Edmund Ironside, the stepson of Cnut, the stepbrother of Harold Harefoot, and the half-brother of Harthacnut. In short, he had a much stronger family claim to the throne than Magnus. All the leaders of England had already acknowledged him as their king, and he was consecrated by an archbishop. England was his own heritage. Whether Magnus defeated him in war or not, he was told: &quot;You can never be called king in England, and you will never be granted any allegiance there before you put an end to my life.&quot; This was supposedly enough to cause Magnus to doubt the strength of his own claim.

The marriage agreement between Gunhilda of Denmark (sister of Harthacnut) and Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor was meant to allow descendants of the marriage to claim the throne of Denmark and potentially of England. From Henry&#x27;s perspective, it was probably orchestrated to allow the Holy Roman Empire to claim control of Denmark and the western areas of the Baltic Sea. She died in 1038 with no known sons. Her only daughter was Beatrice I, Abbess of Quedlinburg, who never married.

== Reputation ==
Apart from the &quot;Ramsey Chronicle&quot;, medieval sources are hostile to Harthacnut. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, he &quot;did nothing worthy of a king as long as he ruled&quot;. Modern historians are less dismissive. In the view of M. K. Lawson, he had at least two of the requisites of a successful medieval king: he was &quot;both ruthless and feared&quot;; had he not died young, the Norman Conquest might not have happened. Ian Howard praises Harthacnut for keeping peace throughout his empire, benefiting trade and merchants, and ensuring a peaceful succession by inviting Edward to his court as his heir. Had he lived longer, Howard believes, his character might have enabled him to become a successful king like his father.

Henry of Huntingdon (12th century) claimed that Harthacnut ordered for the dining tables of his court to be &quot;&quot;laid four times a day with royal sumptuousness&quot; which O&#x27;Brien says is likely a popular myth. Henry of Huntingdon viewed this detail in the context of the monarch sharing these meals with the members of his household, making Harthacnut more generous than his own contemporaries, who &quot;through avarice, or as they pretend through disgust, ... set but one meal a day before their dependents&quot;&quot;. His account produced the image of Harthacnut as a &quot;very generous &quot;. Ranulf Higden (14th century) viewed the same detail in a negative light. He claimed that Harthacnut insisted on having two dinners and two suppers per day. His example influenced the English people, who supposedly were to Higden&#x27;s day gluttonous and extravagant. Higden so claimed that Harthacnut had a lasting effect on the English national character. The association of Harthacnut with gluttony was well known enough to appear in the novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1819) by Walter Scott. The character Cedric comments on his friend Athelstane, whose main character trait is a love for food and drink: &quot;The soul of Hardicanute hath taken possession of him, and he hath no pleasure save to fill, to swill, and to call for more.&quot;

The &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot; treats the death of Harthacnut as the end of an ancient line of kings, and notes that he was the last Danish king to rule over England. But otherwise, Harthacnut is treated as a mere footnote in the line of monarchs, while there are many observations on Cnut. The &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; covers Harthacnut&#x27;s death in some detail, but records next to nothing about his life, suggesting a lack of memorable details on him, presumably due to his short reign.

The &quot;Brut&quot; Chronicle was an Anglo-Norman work, covering British and English monarchs from Brut (Brutus of Troy) to the death of Henry III in 1272. It was probably written during the reign of Edward I (reigned 1272–1307), though the oldest surviving manuscript dates to 1338. The text often includes notable errors. The original author remains unknown, but there were a number of continuations by different hands, continuing the story to the Battle of Halidon Hill (1333). The material on Harthacnut is largely positive. The author considered both Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut to have been sons of Cnut and Emma of Normandy. He portrays Harold as lacking in chivalry, courtesy or honour, and Harthacnut as &quot;a noble knight and stalwart of body, and he greatly loved knighthood and all virtues&quot;. He praises Harthacnut for his generosity with food and drink, writing that his table was open &quot;for all who wished to come to his court to be richly served with royal dishes&quot;. He concludes by portraying Harthacnut as a loyal son for accepting his mother, Emma, back to court.

<doc id="40261" wikidata="Q188627" url="?curid=40261" title="Harold Harefoot">
<text>Harold Harefoot or Harold I (died 17 March 1040) was regent of England from 1035 to 1037 and King of the English from 1037 to 1040. Harold&#x27;s nickname &quot;Harefoot&quot; is first recorded as &quot;Harefoh&quot; or &quot;Harefah&quot; in the twelfth century in the history of Ely Abbey, and according to some late medieval chroniclers it meant that he was &quot;fleet of foot&quot;.

The son of Cnut the Great and Ælfgifu of Northampton, Harold was elected regent of England following the death of his father in 1035. He initially ruled England in place of his brother Harthacnut, who was stuck in Denmark due to a rebellion in Norway which had ousted their brother Svein. Although Harold had wished to be crowned king since 1035, Æthelnoth, Archbishop of Canterbury, refused to do so. It was not until 1037 that Harold, supported by earl Leofric and many others, was officially proclaimed king. The same year, Harold&#x27;s two step-brothers Edward and Alfred returned to England with a considerable military force. Alfred was captured by Earl Godwin, who had him seized and delivered to an escort of men loyal to Harefoot. While en route to Ely, he was blinded and soon after died of his wounds.

Harold died in 1040, having ruled just five years; his half-brother Harthacnut soon returned and took hold of the kingdom peacefully. Harold was originally buried in Westminster, but Harthacnut had his body dragged up and thrown into a fen adjacent to the river Thames, from where it was reportedly recovered by a fisherman and eventually reburied in a Danish cemetery in London.

== Paternity ==
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports that Harold said that he was a son of Cnut the Great and Ælfgifu of Northampton, &quot;although it was not true&quot;. Florence of Worcester (12th century) elaborates on the subject. Claiming that Ælfgifu wanted to have a son by the king but was unable to, she secretly adopted the newborn children of strangers and pretended to have given birth to them. Harold was reportedly the son of a cobbler, while his brother Svein Knutsson was the illegitimate son of a priest. She deceived Cnut into recognizing both children as his own.

21st century author Harriet O&#x27;Brien doubts Cnut, the shrewd politician who &quot;masterminded the bloodless takeover of Norway&quot;, could have been deceived in such a way. She suspects the tale started out as a popular myth, or intentional defamation presumably tailored by Emma of Normandy, the other wife of Cnut and rival to Ælfgifu.

== Harthacnut&#x27;s reign ==
Upon the death of Cnut on 12 November 1035, Harold&#x27;s younger half-brother Harthacnut, the son of Cnut and his queen Emma of Normandy, was the legitimate heir to the thrones of both the Danes and the English. Harthacnut, however, was unable to travel to his coronation in England because his Danish kingdom was under threat of invasion by King Magnus I of Norway and King Anund Jacob of Sweden. England&#x27;s magnates favored the idea of installing Harold Harefoot temporarily as regent or joint monarch, due to the difficulty of Harthacnut&#x27;s absence, and despite the opposition of Godwin, the Earl of Wessex, and the Queen, he eventually wore the crown. There is some dispute in primary sources (the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;) about Harold&#x27;s initial role. Versions E and F mention him as regent, the others as co-ruler.

Ian Howard points out that Cnut had been survived by three sons: Svein, Harold, and Harthacnut. The &quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot; also describes Edward the Confessor and Alfred Aetheling as the sons of Canute, though the modern term would be step-sons. Harold could claim the regency or kingship because he was the only one of the five present in England in 1035. Harthacnut was reigning in Denmark, and Svein had joined him there following his deposition from the Norwegian throne, while Edward and Alfred were in Normandy. Harold could reign in the name of his absent brothers, with Emma rivaling him as a candidate for the regency.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; ignores the existence of Svein, or his claim to the throne, which Howard considers as evidence of the relative entries being unreliable, of failing to give a complete picture. The Heimskringla of Snorri Sturluson claims that Svein and Harthacnut had agreed to share the kingdom between them. This agreement would include Denmark and (probably) England. Snorri quotes older sources on the subject and could be preserving valuable details.

== Reign ==
=== Assumption of the throne ===

Harold reportedly sought coronation as early as 1035. According to the &quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot;, however, Æthelnoth, Archbishop of Canterbury, refused to crown Harold Harefoot. Coronation by the Archbishop would be a legal requirement to become a king. Æthelnoth reportedly placed the sceptre and crown on the altar of a temple, possibly that of the Canterbury Cathedral. Offering to consecrate Harold without using any of the royal regalia would have been an empty honour. He refused to remove the items from the altar and forbade any other bishop from doing so. The tale goes on that Harold failed to sway Æthelnoth, as both bribes and threats proved ineffectual. The despairing Harold reportedly rejected Christianity in protest. He refused to attend church services while uncrowned, preoccupying himself with hunting and trivial matters.

The &quot;Encomium&quot; stays silent on an event reported by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and other sources. Harold was accepted as monarch in a Witenagemot held at Oxford. His chief supporter in the council was Leofric, Earl of Mercia, while the opposition was led by Godwin, Earl of Wessex. There is evidence that Ælfgifu of Northampton was attempting to secure her son&#x27;s position through bribes to the nobles. In 1036, Gunhilda of Denmark, sister to Harthacnut and half-sister to Harold, married Henry III, King of Germany. On this occasion Immo, a priest serving at the court of the Holy Roman Empire, wrote a letter to Azecho, Bishop of Worms. It included information on the situation in England, with messengers from there reporting that Ælfgifu was gaining the support of the leading aristocrats through pleas and bribery, binding them to herself and Harold by oaths of loyalty.

Initially, the Kingdom of England was divided between the two half-brothers. Harold ruled the areas north of the River Thames, supported by the local nobility. The southern nobility under Godwin and Emma continued to be ruled in the name of the absent Harthacnut. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports that Godwin and the leading men of Wessex opposed the rule of Harold for &quot;...as long as they could, but they could not do anything against it.&quot; With the north at least on Harold&#x27;s side, in adherence to the terms of a deal, which Godwin was part of, Emma was settled in Winchester, with Harthacnut&#x27;s huscarls. Harold soon &quot;sent and had taken from her all the best treasures&quot; of Cnut the Great.

The situation could not last for long, and Godwin eventually switched sides. William of Malmesbury asserts that Godwin had been overwhelmed &quot;in power and in numbers&quot; by Harold. In 1037, Emma of Normandy fled to Bruges, Flanders, and Harold &quot;was everywhere chosen as king&quot;. The details behind the event are obscure. The account of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, version E, jumps from Harold being a mere regent to Harold being the sole king. Versions C and D do not even make a distinction between the two phases. Ian Howard theorises that the death of Svein Knutsson could have strengthened Harold&#x27;s position. He went from being the second surviving son of Cnut to being the eldest living, with Harthacnut still absent and unable to press his claim to the throne.

Harold himself is somewhat obscure; the historian Frank Stenton considered it probable that his mother Ælfgifu was &quot;the real ruler of England&quot; for part or all of his reign. Kelly DeVries points out that during the High Middle Ages, royal succession in Northern Europe was determined by military power. The eldest son of a king could have a superior right of inheritance but still lose the throne to a younger brother, or other junior claimant, possessing greater military support. Harold managed to win the throne against the superior claim of Harthacnut in this way. The 11th century provides other similar examples. Magnus I of Norway (reigned 1035–1047), who wasn&#x27;t a warlord, had reigned for more than a decade when his uncle Harald Hardrada (reigned 1047–1066) challenged his rule. With Harald being a famous military leader, his claim would end Magnus&#x27; reign early. Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders (reigned 1067–1070) was effectively succeeded by his brother Robert I (reigned 1071–1093), rather than his own sons. Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy (reigned 1087–1106) lost the throne of England to his younger brothers William II (reigned 1087–1100) and Henry I (reigned 1100–1135).

With the Kingdom of England practically owned by Harold, Harthacnut could not even approach without securing sufficient military strength. His decision to remain in Denmark probably points to him lacking sufficient support, though he would certainly wait for an opportunity to forcefully assert his claim and depose his half-brother. Harold reigned as sole king from 1037 to 1040. There are few surviving documents about events of his reign. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; mostly covers church matters, such as the deaths and appointments of bishops and archbishops. There is, however, a record of a skirmish between the Anglo-Saxons and the Welsh in 1039. The named casualties were Eadwine (Edwin), brother to Leofric, Earl of Mercia, Thurkil, and Ælfgeat, but there are no other details concerning this event. Also in 1039, there is mention of a great gale, again with no details.

=== Return of Ælfred and Edward ===
In 1036, Ælfred Ætheling, son of Emma by the long-dead Æthelred, returned to the kingdom from exile in the Duchy of Normandy with his brother Edward the Confessor, with some show of arms. Their motivation is uncertain. William of Poitiers claimed that they had come to claim the English throne for themselves. Frank Barlow suspected that Emma had invited them, possibly to use them against Harold. If so, it could mean that Emma had abandoned the cause of Harthacnut, probably to strengthen her own position, but that could have inspired Godwin to also abandon the lost cause.

The &quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot; claims that Harold himself had lured them to England, having sent them a forged letter, supposedly written by Emma. The letter reportedly both decried Harold&#x27;s behaviour against her and urged her estranged sons to come and protect her. Barlow and other modern historians suspect that this letter was genuine. Ian Howard argued that Emma not being involved in a major political manoeuvre would be &quot;&quot;out of character for her&quot;, and the Encomium was probably trying to mask her responsibility for a blunder. William of Jumièges reports that earlier in 1036, Edward had conducted a successful raid of Southampton, managing to win a victory against the troops defending the city and then sailing back to Normandy &quot;richly laden with booty&quot;&quot;, but the swift retreat confirms William&#x27;s assessment that Edward would need a larger army to seriously claim the throne.

With his bodyguard, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Ælfred intended to visit his mother, Emma, in Winchester, but he may have made this journey for reasons other than a family reunion. As the &quot;murmur was very much in favour of Harold&quot;, on the direction of Godwin (now apparently on the side of Harold Harefoot), Ælfred was captured. Godwin had him seized and delivered to an escort of men loyal to Harefoot. He was transported by ship to Ely, and blinded while on board. He died in Ely soon after due to the severity of the wounds, his bodyguard similarly treated. The event would later affect the relationship between Edward and Godwin, the Confessor holding Godwin responsible for the death of his brother.

The failed invasion shows that Harold Harefoot, as a son and successor to Cnut, had gained the support of Anglo-Danish nobility, which violently rejected the claims of Ælfred, Edward, and (by extension) the Aethelings. The House of Wessex had lost support among the nobility of the Kingdom. It might also have served as a turning point in the struggle between Harold and Emma that resulted in Emma&#x27;s exile.

=== Death ===
Harold died at Oxford on 17 March 1040, just as Harthacnut was preparing an invasion force of Danes, and was buried at Westminster Abbey. His body was subsequently exhumed, beheaded, and thrown into a fen bordering the Thames when Harthacnut assumed the throne in June 1040. The body was subsequently recovered by fishermen, and resident Danes reportedly had it reburied at their local cemetery in London. The body was eventually buried in a church in the City of Westminster, which was fittingly named St. Clement Danes. A contradictory account in the &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot; (13th century) reports Harold buried in the city of Morstr, alongside his half-brother Harthacnut and their father Cnut. While mentioned as a great city in the text, nothing else is known of Morstr. The &quot;Heimskringla&quot; by Snorri Sturluson reports Harold Harefoot to have been buried at Winchester, again alongside Cnut and Harthacnut.

The cause of Harold&#x27;s death is uncertain. Katherine Holman attributes the death to &quot;a mysterious illness&quot;. An Anglo-Saxon charter attributes the illness to divine judgment. Harold had reportedly claimed Sandwich for himself, thereby depriving the monks of Christchurch. Harold is described as lying ill and in despair at Oxford. When monks came to him to settle the dispute over Sandwich, he &quot;lay and grew black as they spoke&quot;. The context of the event was a dispute between Christchurch and St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, which took over the local toll in the name of the king. There is little attention paid to the illness of the king. Harriet O&#x27;Brien feels this is enough to indicate that Harold died of natural causes, but not to determine the nature of the disease. The Anglo-Saxons themselves would consider him elf-shot (attacked by elves), their term for any number of deadly diseases. Michael Evans points out that Harold was only one of several youthful kings of pre-Conquest England to die following short reigns. Others included Edmund I (reigned 939–946, murdered at age 25), Eadred (reigned 946–955, died at age 32), Eadwig (reigned 955–959, died at age 19), Edmund Ironside (reigned 1016, died at age 26), and Harthacnut (reigned 1040–1042, who would die at age 24). Evans wonders whether the role of king was dangerous in this era, more so than in the period after the Conquest, or whether hereditary diseases were in effect since most of these kings were members of the same lineage, the House of Wessex.

It is unclear why a king would have been buried at Westminster Abbey. The only previous royals reportedly buried there were Sæberht of Essex and his wife Æthelgoda. Emma Mason speculates that Cnut had built a royal residence in the vicinity of the Abbey, or that Westminster held some significance to the Danish Kings of England, which would also explain why Harthacnut would not allow a usurper to be buried there. The lack of detail in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; implies that, for its compilers, the main point of interest was not the burial site, but the exhumation of the body. Harriet O&#x27;Brien theorises that the choice of location might simply reflect the political affiliation of the area of Westminster and nearby London, being a power base for Harold.

A detailed account of the exhumation appears in the writings of John of Worcester (12th century). The group tasked with the mission was reportedly led by Ælfric Puttoc, Archbishop of York, and Godwin, Earl of Wessex. The involvement of such notable men would have had a significance of its own, giving the event an official nature and avoiding secrecy. Emma Mason suspects that this could also serve as a punishment for Godwin, who had served as a chief supporter of Harold, and was now charged with the gruesome task.

== Offspring ==
Harold may have had a wife, Ælfgifu, and a son, Ælfwine, who became a monk on the continent when he was older – his monastic name was Alboin. Ælfwine/Alboin is recorded in 1060 and 1062 in charters from the Abbey Church of Saint Foy in Conques, which mention him as son of &quot;Heroldus rex fuit Anglorum&quot; (Latin: Harold, who was king of the English People). Harold Harefoot is the most likely father as the only other king Harold was Harold Godwinson, who would not rise to the throne until 1066. Either way, an underage boy would be unable to claim the throne in 1040. His possible hereditary claims would not be enough to gain the support of the leading nobles against the adult Harthacnut.

Ælfgifu of Northampton disappears with no trace after 1040. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Harold Harefoot ruled for four years and sixteen weeks, by which calculation he would have begun ruling two weeks after the death of Cnut.

== Reputation ==
The &quot;Prose Brut chronicle&quot; was an Anglo-Norman work, covering British and English monarchs from Brut (Brutus of Troy) to the death of Henry III in 1272. It was probably written during the reign of Edward I (reigned 1272–1307), though the oldest surviving manuscript dates to 1338. The text often includes notable errors. The original author remains unknown, but there were a number of continuations by different hands, extending the story to the Battle of Halidon Hill (1333). The material on Harold Harefoot is rather unflattering. The author considered both Harold and Harthacnut to have been sons of Cnut and Emma of Normandy. He proceeds to portray Harold as follows: &quot;...He went astray from the qualities and conduct of his father King Cnut, for he cared not at all for knighthood, for courtesy, or for honour, but only for his own will...&quot;. He accuses Harold of driving his own mother Emma out of England, by the advice of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. He paints Harthacnut in a more favorable light.

The &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot; (13th century) considers Harold Harefoot to be the oldest son of Cnut and Emma of Normandy, though its author frequently misrepresents family relationships. Harthacnut and Gunhilda of Denmark are regarded in the text as his younger siblings. The narrative has Harold and Harthacnut dividing the realms of their father in an agreement. It also features Harold offering hospitality to his half-brother Edward the Confessor, but they were actually step-brothers, and Edward only settled in England following the death of Harold.

<doc id="40272" wikidata="Q1302156" url="?curid=40272" title="Industrial sociology">
<text>Industrial sociology, until recently a crucial research area within the field of sociology of work, examines
&quot;the direction and implications of trends in technological change, globalization, labour markets, work organization, managerial practices and employment relations&quot; to &quot;the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families&quot;, and &quot; the ways in which workers challenge, resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions&quot;.

== Labour process theory ==
One branch of industrial sociology is labour process theory (LPT). In 1974, Harry Braverman wrote &quot;Labor and Monopoly Capital&quot;, which provided a critical analysis of scientific management. This book analysed capitalist productive relations from a Marxist perspective. Following Marx, Braverman argued that work within capitalist organizations was exploitative and alienating, and therefore workers had to be coerced into servitude. For Braverman the pursuit of capitalist interests over time ultimately leads to deskilling and routinization of the worker. The Taylorist work design is the ultimate embodiment of this tendency.

Braverman demonstrated several mechanisms of control in both the factory blue-collar and clerical white-collar labour force.
His key contribution is his &quot;deskilling&quot; thesis. Braverman argued that capitalist owners and managers were incessantly driven to deskill the labour force to lower production costs and ensure higher productivity. Deskilled labour is cheap and above all easy to control due to the workers&#x27; lack of direct engagement in the production process. In turn work becomes intellectually or emotionally unfulfilling; the lack of capitalist reliance on human skill reduces the need of employers to reward workers in anything but a minimal economic way.

Braverman&#x27;s contribution to the sociology of work and industry (i.e., industrial sociology) has been important and his theories of the labour process continue to inform teaching and research. Braverman&#x27;s thesis has, however, been contested, by Andrew Freidman in his work &quot;Industry and Labour&quot; (1977). In it, Freidman suggests that whilst the direct control of labour is beneficial for the capitalist under certain circumstances, a degree of &quot;responsible autonomy&quot; can be granted to unionized or &quot;core&quot; workers, in order to harness their skill under controlled conditions. Also, Richard Edwards showed in 1979 that although hierarchy in organizations has remained constant, additional forms of control (such as technical control via email monitoring, call monitoring; bureaucratic control via procedures for leave, sickness etc.) have been added to gain the interests of the capitalist class versus the workers. Duncan Gallie has shown how important it is to approach the question of skill from a social class perspective. In his study, the majority of non-manual, intermediate and skilled manual workers believed that their work had come to demand a higher level of skill, but the majority of manual workers felt that the responsibility and skill needed in their work had either remained constant or declined. This implies that Braverman&#x27;s claims can&#x27;t be applied to all social classes.

The notion the particular type of technology workers were exposed to shapes their experience was most forcefully argued in a classic study by Robert Blauner. He argued that some work is alienating more than other types because of the different technologies workers use. Alienation, to Blauner, has four dimensions: powerlessness, meaninglessness, isolation, and self-estrangement. Individuals are powerless when they can&#x27;t control their own actions or conditions of work; work is meaningless when it gives employees little or no sense of value, interest or worth; work is isolating when workers cannot identify with their workplace; and work is self-estranging when, at the subjective level, the worker has no sense of involvement in the job.

Blauner&#x27;s claims however fail to recognize that the same technology can be experienced in a variety of ways. Studies have shown that cultural differences with regard to management–union relations, levels of hierarchical control, and reward and performance appraisal policies mean that the experience of the same kind of work can vary considerably between countries and firms. The individualization of work and the need for workers to have more flexible skills in order to respond to technological changes means that Blauner&#x27;s characterization of work experience is no longer valid. Additionally, workers today may work in teams to alleviate workers&#x27; sense of alienation, since they are involved in the entire process, rather than just a small part of it. In conclusion, automative technologies and computerized work systems have typically enhanced workers&#x27; job satisfaction and skill deployment in the better-paid, secure public and private sector jobs. But, in more non-skilled manual work, they have just perpetuated job dissatisfaction, especially for the many women involved in this type of work.

<doc id="40275" wikidata="Q2094083" url="?curid=40275" title="Kayaking">
<text>Kayaking is the use of a kayak for moving over water. It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.

==History==
Kayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the skeleton of whales, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, which literally translates to &quot;hunter&#x27;s boat&quot; was for hunting and fishing. The kayak&#x27;s stealth capabilities allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind animals on the shoreline and successfully catch their prey.

In the 1740s, Russian explorers led by the Danish-born Russian explorer Vitus Bering came in contact with the Aleutians, who had taken the basic kayak concept and developed multiple designs specifically for hunting, transportation, and environmental conditions. They soon recognized the Aleutians were very skillful at hunting sea otters by kayak. Because otters were a popular commodity in Europe and Asia, they would exploit and even kidnap Aleutians and keep them aboard their ships to work and hunt.

By the mid-1800s the kayak became increasingly popular and the Europeans became interested. German and French men began kayaking for sport. In 1931, Adolf Anderle was the first person to kayak down the Salzachöfen Gorge, which is believed to be the birthplace of modern-day white-water kayaking. In 1932, long-distance kayaker Fridel Meyer paddled from Bavaria to Westminster, England, and in 1933 she paddled from Westminster to Montrose, Scotland. Kayak races were introduced in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936.

In the 1950s, fiberglass kayaks were developed and commonly used, until the 1980s when polyester and polyethylene plastic kayaks were introduced. Kayaking progressed as a fringe sport in the U.S. until the 1970s, when it became a mainstream popular sport. Now, more than 10 white water kayaking events are featured in the Olympics. While kayaking represents a key international watersport, few academic studies have (to date) been conducted on the role kayaking plays in the lives and activities of the public 

==Design==
Kayaks can also be classified by their design and the materials from which they are made. Each design has its specific advantages, including performance, maneuverability, stability, and paddling style. Kayaks can be made of metal, fiberglass, wood, plastic, fabrics, and inflatable fabrics such as PVC or rubber, and more recently expensive but feather-light carbon fiber. Each material also has its specific advantages, including strength, durability, portability, flexibility, resistance to ultraviolet, and storage requirements. For example, wooden kayaks can be created from kits or built by hand. Stitch and glue, plywood kayaks can be lighter than any other material except skin-on frame. Inflatable kayaks, made from lightweight fabric, can be deflated and easily transported and stored, and are considered to be remarkably tough and durable compared to some hard-sided boats.

==Equipment==

There are many types of kayaks used in flat water and whitewater kayaking. The sizes and shapes vary drastically depending on what type of water to be paddled on and also what the paddler would like to do. The second set of essentials for kayaking is an off-set paddle where the paddle blades are tilted to help reduce wind resistance while the other blade is being used in the water. These vary in length and also shape depending on the intended use, the height of the paddler, and the paddler&#x27;s preference. Kayaks should be equipped with one or more buoyancy aid (also called flotation) which creates air space that helps prevent a kayak from sinking when filled with water. A life jacket should be worn at all times (also called a personal flotation device or PFD), and a helmet is also often required for most kayaking and is mandatory for white water kayaking. Various other pieces of safety gear include a whistle for signaling for help; throwing ropes to help rescue other kayakers; and, a diving knife and appropriate water shoes should be used depending upon the risks the water and terrain pose. Proper clothing such as a dry suit, wetsuit or spray top also help protect kayakers from cold water or air temperatures.

===Types of kayaks===
&quot;Sit on top&quot; kayaks place the paddler in an open, shallowly concave deck above the water level. This style is usually used for non-white water activities as most find it harder to stay inside the kayak while also preventing them from &quot;rolling&quot; which allows the user to upright themselves if they flip over. There are some benefits to sit on tops such as the ability for a &quot;dry hatch&quot; these are a compartment, that usually runs the length of the kayak, which in addition to providing more buoyancy allows for the kayaker to store various equipment. &quot;Sit on top&quot; kayaks often use &quot;through holes&quot; which allows any water that got in the boat to make it through the deck and dry hatch to drain. &quot;Cockpit style&quot; involves sitting with the legs and hips inside the kayak hull with a spray deck or &quot;spray skirt&quot; that creates a water-resistant seal around the waist. There is a wide range of &quot;cockpit style&quot; boats which usually allow for more user control of the boat as they are able to push against the walls of the boat to tip in order to complete maneuvers. A common variant of &quot;cockpit style&quot; kayaks are &quot;play boats&quot; these are usually very short kayaks in which the user does tricks and maneuvers: &quot;Inflatables&quot; are a hybrid of the two previous configurations; these boats have an open deck, but the paddler sits below the level of the deck. These boats are often subject to more instability due to the way the boat sits higher in the water. They are often used in a more commercial setting, they are often affectionately called &quot;Duckies&quot;. &quot;Tandems&quot; are configured for multiple paddlers, in contrast to the single person designs featured by most kayaks. Tandems can be used by two or even three paddlers.

==Activities==

Because of their range and adaptability, kayaks can be useful for other outdoor activities such as diving, fishing, wilderness exploration and search and rescue during floods.

===Diving===

Kayak diving is a type of recreational diving where the divers paddle to a diving site in a kayak carrying all their gear to the place they want to dive. The range can be up to several kilometres along the coastline from the launching point to a place where access would be difficult from the shore, although the sea is sheltered. It is a considerably cheaper alternative to using a powered boat, as well as combining the experience of sea kayaking at the same time. Kayak diving gives the diver independence from dive boat operators, while allowing dives at sites which are too far to comfortably swim, but are sufficiently sheltered.

===Fishing===

Kayak fishing is fishing from a kayak, long a means of transportation and stealthily approaching easily spooked fish, such as cobia and flounder. Kayak fishing has gained popularity in recent times due to its broad appeal as an environmentally friendly and healthy method of transportation, as well as its relatively low cost of entry compared to motorized boats. In addition, kayaks allow greater access by their ability to operate in shallow water, getting in and out along the shoreline, and having the ability to get away from the crowds to find a more solitary environment where boats may not have the ability to do so.

===Ecotourism===
Ecotourism based on kayak trips is gaining in popularity. In warm-water vacation destinations such as Sarasota Keys, guided kayak trips take kayakers on a tour of the local ecosystem. Kayakers can watch dolphins breach and manatees eat seagrass, in shallow bay water.

===Whitewater===

One of the most common uses of kayaks for hobbyists is whitewater kayaking. Whitewater kayaking is when a kayaker traverses down a series of rapids. The difficulty of these rapid ranges from Class I to Class VI. The difficulty of rapids often changes with water level and debris in the river. Debris that inhibits a kayaker&#x27;s path are often called &quot;strainers&quot; as they &quot;strain&quot; out the kayakers like a colander. There are often training camps as well as man-made structures to help train kayakers.

===Surf ski===

A surfski (or: &quot;surf ski&quot;, &quot;surf-ski&quot;) is generally the longest of all kayaks and is a performance oriented kayak designed for speed on open water, most commonly the ocean, although it is well suited to all bodies of water and recreational paddling.

===Winter kayaking===
Winter kayaking is inherently more dangerous than regular paddling, as cold water and air temperatures can quickly lead to hypothermia. The activity requires the use of clothing that negates the effects of the elements on the kayaker.

<text>Blackboard bold is a style of writing bold symbols on a blackboard by doubling certain strokes, commonly used in mathematical lectures, and the derived style of typeface used in printed mathematical texts. The style is most commonly used to represent the number sets formula_1 (natural numbers), formula_2 (integers), formula_3 (rational numbers), formula_4 (real numbers), and formula_5 (complex numbers).

To imitate a bold typeface on a typewriter, a character can be typed over itself (called &quot;double-striking&quot;); symbols thus produced are called double-struck, and this name is sometimes adopted for blackboard bold symbols, for instance in Unicode glyph names.

In typography, a typeface with characters that are not solid is called &quot;inline&quot;, &quot;handtooled&quot;, or &quot;open face&quot;.

==History==


Traditionally, various symbols were indicated by boldface in print but on blackboards and in manuscripts &quot;by wavy underscoring, or enclosure in a circle, or even by wavy overscoring&quot;.

Most typewriters have no dedicated bold characters at all. To produce a bold effect on a typewriter, a character can be &quot;double-struck&quot; with or without a small offset. By the mid 1960s, typewriter accessories such as the &quot;Doublebold&quot; could automatically double-strike every character while engaged. While this method makes a character bolder, and can effectively emphasize words or passages, in isolation a double-struck character is not always clearly different from its single-struck counterpart.

Blackboard bold originated from the attempt to write bold symbols on typewriters and blackboards that were legible but distinct, perhaps starting in the late 1950s in France, and then taking hold at the Princeton University mathematics department in the early 1960s. Mathematical authors began typing faux-bold letters by double-striking them with a significant offset or over-striking them with the letter &quot;I&quot;, creating new symbols such as

IR,
IN,
CC,
or ZZ;
at the blackboard, lecturers began writing bold symbols with certain doubled strokes. The notation caught on: blackboard bold spread from classroom to classroom and is now used around the world.

The style made its way into print starting in the mid 1960s. Early examples include Robert Gunning and Hugo Rossi&#x27;s &quot;Analytic Functions of Several Complex Variables&quot; (1965) and Lynn Loomis and Shlomo Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;Advanced Calculus&quot; (1968). Initial adoption was sporadic, however, and most publishers continued using boldface. In 1979, Wiley recommended its authors avoid &quot;double-backed shadow or outline letters, sometimes called blackboard bold&quot;, because they could not always be printed; in 1982, Wiley refused to include blackboard bold characters in mathematical books because the type was difficult and expensive to obtain.

Donald Knuth preferred boldface to blackboard bold and so did not include blackboard bold in the Computer Modern typeface that he created for the TeX mathematical typesetting system he first released in 1978. When Knuth&#x27;s 1984 &quot;The TeXbook&quot; needed an example of blackboard bold for the index, he produced formula_6 using the letters &quot;I&quot; and &quot;R&quot; with a negative space between; in 1988 Robert Messer extended this to a full set of &quot;poor person&#x27;s blackboard bold&quot; macros, overtyping each capital letter with carefully placed &quot;I&quot; characters or vertical lines.

Not all mathematical authors were satisfied with such workarounds. The American Mathematical Society created a simple chalk-style blackboard bold typeface in 1985 to go with the AMS-TeX package created by Michael Spivak, accessed using the codice_1 command (for &quot;blackboard bold&quot;); in 1990, the AMS released an update with a new inline-style blackboard bold font intended to better match Times. Since then, a variety of other blackboard bold typefaces have been created, some following the style of traditional inline typefaces and others closer in form to letters drawn with chalk.

Unicode included the most common blackboard bold letters among the &quot;Letterlike Symbols&quot; in version 1.0 (1991), inherited from the Xerox Character Code Standard. Later versions of Unicode extended this set to all uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and a variety of other symbols, among the &quot;Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols&quot;.

In professionally typeset books, publishers and authors have gradually adopted blackboard bold, and its use is now commonplace, but some still use ordinary bold symbols. Some authors use blackboard bold letters on the blackboard or in manuscripts, but prefer an ordinary bold typeface in print; for example, Jean-Pierre Serre has used blackboard bold in lectures, but has consistently used ordinary bold for the same symbols in his published works. The &quot;Chicago Manual of Style&quot;″s recommendation has evolved over time: In 1993, for the 14th edition, it advised that &quot;blackboard bold should be confined to the classroom&quot; (13.14); In 2003, for the 15th edition, it stated that &quot;open-faced (blackboard) symbols are reserved for familiar systems of numbers&quot; (14.12). The international standard ISO 80000-2:2019 lists as the symbol for the real numbers but notes &quot;the symbols and formula_4 are also used&quot;, and similarly for , , , , and (prime numbers).

== Encoding ==
TeX, the standard typesetting system for mathematical texts, does not contain direct support for blackboard bold symbols, but the American Mathematical Society distributes the AMSFonts collection, loaded from the codice_2 package, which includes a blackboard bold typeface for uppercase Latin letters accessed using codice_3 (e.g. codice_4 produces 

In Unicode, a few of the more common blackboard bold characters () are encoded in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) in the &quot;Letterlike Symbols&quot; (2100–214F) area, named DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL C etc. The rest, however, are encoded outside the BMP, in &quot;Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols&quot; (1D400–1D7FF), specifically from 1D538–1D550 (uppercase, excluding those encoded in the BMP), 1D552–1D56B (lowercase) and 1D7D8–1D7E1 (digits). Blackboard bold Arabic letters are encoded in Arabic Mathematical Alphabetic Symbols (1EE00–1EEFF), specifically 1EEA1–1EEBB.

== Usage ==
The following table shows all available Unicode blackboard bold characters.

The first column shows the letter as typically rendered by the LaTeX markup system. The second column shows the Unicode code point. The third column shows the Unicode symbol itself (which will only display correctly on browsers that support Unicode and have access to a suitable typeface). The fourth column describes some typical usage in mathematical texts. Some of the symbols (particularly formula_8 and formula_9) are nearly universal in their interpretation, while others are more varied in use. 

In addition, a blackboard-bold μ&quot;n&quot; (not found in Unicode or LaTeX) is sometimes used by number theorists and algebraic geometers to designate the group scheme of roots of unity.

Note: Only uppercase Roman letters are given LaTeX renderings because Wikipedia&#x27;s implementation uses the AMSFonts blackboard bold typeface, which does not support other characters.

<text>Corpus linguistics is an empirical method for the study of language by way of a text corpus (plural &quot;corpora&quot;). Corpora are balanced, often stratified collections of authentic, &quot;real world&quot;, text of speech or writing that aim to represent a given linguistic variety. Today, corpora are generally machine-readable data collections. 

Corpus linguistics proposes that a reliable analysis of a language is more feasible with corpora collected in the field—the natural context (&quot;realia&quot;) of that language—with minimal experimental interference. Large collections of text, though corpora may also be small in terms of running words, allow linguists to run quantitative analyses on linguistic concepts that may be difficult to test in a qualitative manner.

The text-corpus method uses the body of texts in any natural language to derive the set of abstract rules which govern that language. Those results can be used to explore the relationships between that subject language and other languages which have undergone a similar analysis. The first such corpora were manually derived from source texts, but now that work is automated.

Corpora have not only been used for linguistics research, they have since the 1969 been increasingly used to compile dictionaries (starting with &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot; in 1969) and reference grammars, with &quot;A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language&quot;, published in 1985, as a first.

Experts in the field have differing views about the annotation of a corpus. These views range from John McHardy Sinclair, who advocates minimal annotation so texts speak for themselves, to the Survey of English Usage team (University College, London), who advocate annotation as allowing greater linguistic understanding through rigorous recording.

== History ==

Some of the earliest efforts at grammatical description were based at least in part on corpora of particular religious or cultural significance. For example, Prātiśākhya literature described the sound patterns of Sanskrit as found in the Vedas, and 
Pāṇini&#x27;s grammar of classical Sanskrit was based at least in part on analysis of that same corpus. Similarly, the early Arabic grammarians paid particular attention to the language of the Quran. In the Western European tradition, scholars prepared concordances to allow detailed study of the language of the Bible and other canonical texts.

=== English corpora ===

A landmark in modern corpus linguistics was the publication of &quot;Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English&quot; in 1967. Written by Henry Kučera and W. Nelson Francis, the work was based on an analysis of the Brown Corpus, which is a structured and balanced corpus of one million words of American English from the year 1961. The corpus comprises 2000 text samples, from a variety of genres. The Brown Corpus was the first computerized corpus designed for linguistic research. Kučera and Francis subjected the Brown Corpus to a variety of computational analyses and then combined elements of linguistics, language teaching, psychology, statistics, and sociology to create a rich and variegated opus. A further key publication was Randolph Quirk&#x27;s &quot;Towards a description of English Usage&quot; in 1960 in which he introduced the Survey of English Usage. Quirk&#x27;s corpus was the first modern corpus to be built with the purpose of representing the whole language.

Shortly thereafter, Boston publisher Houghton-Mifflin approached Kučera to supply a million-word, three-line citation base for its new &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;, the first dictionary compiled using corpus linguistics. The &quot;AHD&quot; took the innovative step of combining prescriptive elements (how language &quot;should&quot; be used) with descriptive information (how it actually &quot;is&quot; used).

Other publishers followed suit. The British publisher Collins&#x27; COBUILD monolingual learner&#x27;s dictionary, designed for users learning English as a foreign language, was compiled using the Bank of English. The Survey of English Usage Corpus was used in the development of one of the most important Corpus-based Grammars, which was written by Quirk &quot;et al.&quot; and published in 1985 as &quot;A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language&quot;.

The Brown Corpus has also spawned a number of similarly structured corpora: the LOB Corpus (1960s British English), Kolhapur (Indian English), Wellington (New Zealand English), Australian Corpus of English (Australian English), the Frown Corpus (early 1990s American English), and the FLOB Corpus (1990s British English). Other corpora represent many languages, varieties and modes, and include the International Corpus of English, and the British National Corpus, a 100 million word collection of a range of spoken and written texts, created in the 1990s by a consortium of publishers, universities (Oxford and Lancaster) and the British Library. For contemporary American English, work has stalled on the American National Corpus, but the 400+ million word Corpus of Contemporary American English (1990–present) is now available through a web interface.

The first computerized corpus of transcribed spoken language was constructed in 1971 by the Montreal French Project, containing one million words, which inspired Shana Poplack&#x27;s much larger corpus of spoken French in the Ottawa-Hull area.

=== Multilingual corpora ===

In the 1990s, many of the notable early successes on statistical methods in natural-language programming (NLP) occurred in the field of machine translation, due especially to work at IBM Research. These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government.

There are corpora in non-European languages as well. For example, the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics in Japan has built a number of corpora of spoken and written Japanese. Sign language corpora have also been created using video data.

=== Ancient languages corpora ===

Besides these corpora of living languages, computerized corpora have also been made of collections of texts in ancient languages. An example is the Andersen-Forbes database of the Hebrew Bible, developed since the 1970s, in which every clause is parsed using graphs representing up to seven levels of syntax, and every segment tagged with seven fields of information. The Quranic Arabic Corpus is an annotated corpus for the Classical Arabic language of the Quran. This is a recent project with multiple layers of annotation including morphological segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis using dependency grammar. The Digital Corpus of Sanskrit (DCS) is a &quot;Sandhi-split corpus of Sanskrit texts with full morphological and lexical analysis... designed for text-historical research in Sanskrit linguistics and philology.&quot;

=== Corpora from specific fields ===

Besides pure linguistic inquiry, researchers had begun to apply corpus linguistics to other academic and professional fields, such as the emerging sub-discipline of Law and Corpus Linguistics, which seeks to understand legal texts using corpus data and tools. The DBLP Discovery Dataset concentrates on computer science, containing relevant computer science publications with sentient metadata such as author affiliations, citations, or study fields. A more focused dataset was introduced by NLP Scholar, a combination of papers of the ACL Anthology and Google Scholar metadata. Corpora can also aid in translation efforts or in teaching foreign languages.

== Methods ==
Corpus linguistics has generated a number of research methods, which attempt to trace a path from data to theory. Wallis and Nelson (2001) first introduced what they called the 3A perspective: Annotation, Abstraction and Analysis.

* Annotation consists of the application of a scheme to texts. Annotations may include structural markup, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and numerous other representations.
* Abstraction consists of the translation (mapping) of terms in the scheme to terms in a theoretically motivated model or dataset. Abstraction typically includes linguist-directed search but may include e.g., rule-learning for parsers.
* Analysis consists of statistically probing, manipulating and generalising from the dataset. Analysis might include statistical evaluations, optimisation of rule-bases or knowledge discovery methods.

Most lexical corpora today are part-of-speech-tagged (POS-tagged). However even corpus linguists who work with &#x27;unannotated plain text&#x27; inevitably apply some method to isolate salient terms. In such situations annotation and abstraction are combined in a lexical search.

The advantage of publishing an annotated corpus is that other users can then perform experiments on the corpus (through corpus managers). Linguists with other interests and differing perspectives than the originators&#x27; can exploit this work. By sharing data, corpus linguists are able to treat the corpus as a locus of linguistic debate and further study.
