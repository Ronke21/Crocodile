==Etymology==

The Maryland state legislature named Montgomery County after Richard Montgomery; the county was created from lands that had at one point or another been part of Frederick County. On September 6, 1776, Thomas Sprigg Wootton from Rockville, Maryland, introduced legislation, while serving at the Maryland Constitutional Convention, to create lower Frederick County as Montgomery County. The name, Montgomery County, along with the founding of Washington County, Maryland, after George Washington, was the first time in American history that counties and provinces in the Thirteen Colonies were not named after British referents. 

The name use of Montgomery and Washington County were seen as further defiance to Great Britain during the American Revolutionary War. The county&#x27;s nickname of &quot;MoCo&quot; is derived from &quot;Montgomery County&quot;, in use as early as 2001.

The county&#x27;s motto, adopted in 1976, is &quot;Gardez Bien&quot;, a French phrase meaning &quot;Watch Well&quot;. The county&#x27;s motto is also the motto of its namesake&#x27;s family.

==History==

Prior to 1688, the first tract of land in what is now Montgomery County was granted by Charles I in a charter to the first Lord Baltimore, the head of the Calvert family. The county&#x27;s creation was a focus of Thomas S. Wootton who, on August 31, 1776, introduced a measure to form a new county from Frederick County, Maryland to aid area residents in simplifying their business affairs. The measure passed, creating the new political entity of Montgomery County in what was then the colonial-era Province of Maryland.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.1%) is water. Montgomery County lies entirely inside the Piedmont plateau. The topography is generally rolling. Elevations range from a low of near sea level along the Potomac River to about 875 feet in the northernmost portion of the county north of Damascus. Relief between valley bottoms and hilltops is several hundred feet. Earthquakes are rare; the most recent one, on June 24, 2024, had a 1.8 magnitude and was centered near Spencerville, Maryland.

When Montgomery County was created in 1776, its boundaries were defined as &quot;beginning at the east side of the mouth of Rock Creek on Potomac river [sic], and running with the said river to the mouth of Monocacy, then with a straight line to Par&#x27;s spring, from thence with the lines of the county to the beginning&quot;.

The county&#x27;s boundary forms a sliver of land at the far northern tip of the county that is several miles long and averages less than 200 yards wide. In fact, a single house on Lakeview Drive and its yard is sectioned by this sliver into three portions, each separately contained within Montgomery, Frederick and Howard counties. These jurisdictions and Carroll County meet at a single point at Parr&#x27;s Spring on Parr&#x27;s Ridge.

==Demographics==
Since the 1970s, the county has had in place a Moderately Priced Dwelling Unit (MPDU) zoning plan that requires developers to include affordable housing in any new residential developments that they construct in the county. The goal is to create socioeconomically mixed neighborhoods and schools so the rich and poor are not isolated in separate parts of the county. Developers who provide for more than the minimum amount of MPDUs are rewarded with permission to increase the density of their developments, which allows them to build more housing and generate more revenue. Montgomery County was one of the first counties in the U.S. to adopt such a plan, and many other areas have since followed suit.

Montgomery County is by far one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse counties in the United States; four of the ten most culturally diverse cities and towns in the U.S. are in Montgomery County: Gaithersburg, ranking second; Germantown, ranking third; Silver Spring, ranking fourth; and Rockville, ranking ninth. Gaithersburg, Germantown, and Silver Spring all rank as more culturally diverse than New York City, San Jose, and Oakland. Maryland overall is one of six minority-majority states, and the only minority-majority state on the East Coast.

Poor transportation was a hindrance for Montgomery County&#x27;s farmers who wanted to transport their crops to market in the early 18th century. Montgomery County&#x27;s first roads, often barely adequate, were built by the 18th century.

One early road, Maryland Route 355, connected Frederick and Georgetown. There was a road, Maryland Route 190 that connected Georgetown and the mouth of the Monocacy River. Plans to continue the road to Cumberland did not come to fruition. Another road connected the Montgomery County Courthouse with Sandy Spring and Baltimore, and one other road connected the courthouse with Bladensburg and Annapolis.

The county&#x27;s first turnpike was chartered in 1806, but its construction began in 1817. In 1828, the turnpike was completed, running from Georgetown to Rockville. It was the first paved road in Montgomery County.

In 1849, the Seventh Street Turnpike (now called Georgia Avenue) was extended from Washington to Brookeville. The Colesville–Ashton Turnpike was built in 1870 (now parts of Colesville Road, Columbia Pike, and New Hampshire Avenue).

The United States Army Corps of Engineers built the Washington Aqueduct between 1853 and 1864, to supply water from Great Falls to Washington. The aqueduct was covered in 1875, and it became known as Conduit Road. The Union Arch Bridge, which carries the aqueduct across Cabin John Creek, was the longest single-arch bridge in the world at the time it was completed in 1864. The road is now named MacArthur Boulevard.

<text>Rockville is a city in and the county seat of Montgomery County, Maryland, United States, and is part of the Washington metropolitan area. The 2020 census tabulated Rockville&#x27;s population at 67,117, making it the fourth-largest incorporated city in Maryland.

Rockville, along with neighboring Gaithersburg and Bethesda, is at the core of the Interstate 270 Technology Corridor which is home to numerous software and biotechnology companies as well as several federal government institutions. The city, one of the major retail hubs in Montgomery County, has several upscale regional shopping centers.

==History==

===Early history===
Situated in the Piedmont region and crossed by three creeks (Rock Creek, Cabin John Creek, and Watts Branch), Rockville provided an excellent refuge for semi-nomadic Native Americans as early as 8000 BC. By the first millennium BC, a few of these groups had settled down into year-round agricultural communities that exploited the native flora, including sunflowers and marsh elder. By AD 1200, these early groups (dubbed &quot;Montgomery Indians&quot; by later archaeologists) were increasingly drawn into conflict with the Senecas and Susquehannocks who had migrated south from Pennsylvania and New York. Within the present-day boundaries of the city, six prehistoric sites have been uncovered and documented, along with numerous artifacts several thousand years old. By 1700, under pressure from European colonists, the majority of these original inhabitants had been driven away.

The indigenous population carved a path on the high ground, known as Sinequa Trail, which is now downtown Rockville. Later, the Maryland Assembly set the standard of 20 feet for main thoroughfares and designated the Rock Creek Main Road or Great Road to be built to this standard. In the mid-18th century, Lawrence Owen opened a small inn on the road. The place, known as Owen&#x27;s Ordinary, took on greater prominence when, on April 14, 1755, Major General Edward Braddock stopped at Owen&#x27;s Ordinary on a start of a mission from George Town (now Washington, D.C.) to press British claims of the western frontier. The location of the road, near the present Rockville Pike, was strategically located on higher ground, making it dry year-round.

===18th century===
The first land patents in the Rockville area were obtained by Arthur Nelson between 1717 and 1735. Within three decades, the first permanent buildings in what would become the center of Rockville were established on this land. Still a part of Prince George&#x27;s County at this time, the growth of Daniel Dulaney&#x27;s Frederick Town prompted the separation of the western portion of the county, including Rockville, into Frederick County in 1748.

Being a small, unincorporated town, early Rockville was known by a variety of names, including Owen&#x27;s Ordinary, Hungerford&#x27;s Tavern, and Daley&#x27;s Tavern. The first recorded mention of the settlement later known as Rockville dates to the Braddock Expedition in 1755. On April 14, one of the approximately 2,000 men who were accompanying General Braddock through wrote the following: &quot;we marched to larance Owings or Owings Oardianary, a Single House, it being 18 miles and very dirty.&quot; Owen&#x27;s Ordinary was a small rest stop on Rock Creek Main Road (later the Rockville Pike), which stretched from George Town to Frederick Town, and was then one of the largest thoroughfares in the colony of Maryland.

On September 6, 1776, the Maryland Constitutional Convention agreed to a proposal introduced by Thomas Sprigg Wootton wherein Frederick County, the largest and most populous county in Maryland, would be divided into three smaller subdivisions. The southern portion of the county, of which Rockville was a part, was named Montgomery County. The most populous and prosperous urban center in this new county was George Town, but its location at the far southern edge rendered it worthless as a seat of local government. Rockville, a small but centrally located and well-traveled town, was chosen as the seat. At the time, Rockville did not have a name; it was generally called Hungerford&#x27;s Tavern, after the well-known tavern in it. After being named the county seat, the village was referred to by all as Montgomery Court House. The tavern served as the county courthouse, and it held its first such proceedings on May 20, 1777.

In 1784, William Prather Williams, a local landowner, hired a surveyor to lay out much of the town. In his honor, many took to calling the town Williamsburg. In practice, however, Williamsburg and Montgomery Court House were used interchangeably. Rockville came to greater prominence when Montgomery County was created and later when George Town was ceded to the federal government to create the District of Columbia.

===19th century===


A proposal to name the town Wattsville, after the nearby Watts Branch, failed because the stream was later considered too small to give its name to the town. On July 16, 1803, when the area was officially entered into the county land records with the name &quot;Rockville&quot;, derived from Rock Creek. Nevertheless, the name Montgomery Court House continued to appear on maps and other documents through the 1820s.

By petition of Rockville&#x27;s citizens, the Maryland General Assembly incorporated the village on March 10, 1860. During the American Civil War, General George B. McClellan stayed at the Beall Dawson house in 1862. In addition, General J.E.B. Stuart and an army of 8,000 Confederate cavalrymen marched through and occupied Rockville on June 28, 1863, while on their way to Gettysburg and stayed at the Prettyman house. Jubal Anderson Early also crossed through Rockville on his way to and from his 1864 attack on Washington.

In 1913, on the birthday of Jefferson Davis, the United Daughters of the Confederacy erected a statue near the Rockville courthouse dedicated to Confederate soldiers from Montgomery County. The monument was removed in 2017 as part of a wave of removals of Confederate monuments and memorials in response to the 2015 Charleston church shooting, and is now located in White&#x27;s Ferry.

In 1873, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad arrived, making Rockville easily accessible from Washington, D.C. (&quot;See Metropolitan Branch.&quot;) In July 1891, the Tennallytown and Rockville Railway inaugurated Rockville&#x27;s first trolley service connecting to the Georgetown and Tennallytown Railway terminus at Western Avenue and Wisconsin Avenue.

===20th century to today===


The newly opened railroad provided service from Georgetown to Rockville, connecting Rockville to Washington, D.C., by trolley. Trolley service operated for four decades, until, eclipsed by the growing usage of the automobile, service was halted in August 1935. The Blue Ridge Transportation Company provided bus service for Rockville and Montgomery County from 1924 through 1955. After 1955, Rockville would not see a concerted effort to develop a public transportation infrastructure until the 1970s, when the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) began work to extend the Washington Metro into Rockville and extended Metrobus service into Montgomery County. The Rockville station of Washington Metro began service on July 25, 1984, and the Twinbrook station began service on December 15, 1984. Metrobus service was supplemented by Montgomery County&#x27;s own Ride On bus service starting in 1979. MARC, Maryland&#x27;s Rail Commuter service, serves Rockville with its Brunswick line. From Rockville MARC provides service to Washington Union Station in Washington D.C. (southbound), and Frederick and Martinsburg, West Virginia (northbound), as well as intermediate points. Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service from Rockville to Chicago and Washington D.C.

The mid-20th century saw substantial growth in Rockville, especially with the annexation of the Twinbrook subdivision in 1949, which added hundreds of new homes and thousands of new residents to the city. In 1954, Congressional Airport closed, and its land was sold to developers to build residences and a commercial shopping center. The shopping center, named Congressional Plaza, opened in 1958. These new areas provided affordable housing and grew quickly with young families eager to start their lives following World War II.

During the Cold War, it was considered safer to remain in Rockville than to evacuate during a hypothetical nuclear attack on Washington, D.C. Bomb shelters were built, including the largest one at Glenview Mansion and 15 other locations. The I-270 highway was designated as an emergency aircraft landing strip. Two Nike missile launcher sites were located on Muddy Branch and Snouffer School Roads until the mid-1970s.

From the 1960s, Rockville&#x27;s town center, formerly one of the area&#x27;s commercial centers, suffered from a period of decline. Rockville soon became the first city in Maryland to enter into a government funded urban renewal program. This resulted in the demolition of most of the original business district. Included in the plan was the unsuccessful Rockville Mall, which failed to attract either major retailers or customers and was demolished in 1994, various government buildings such as the new Montgomery County Judicial Center, and a reorganization of the road plan near the Courthouse. Unfortunately, the once-promising plan was for the most part a disappointment. Although efforts to restore the town center continue, the majority of the city&#x27;s economic activity has since relocated along Rockville Pike (MD Route 355/Wisconsin Avenue). In 2004, Rockville Mayor Larry Giammo announced plans to renovate the Rockville Town Square, including building new stores and housing and relocating the city&#x27;s library. In the past year, the new Rockville Town Center has been transformed and includes a number of boutique-like stores, restaurants, condominiums and apartments, as well as stages, fountains and the Rockville Library. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#x27;s headquarters is just south of the city&#x27;s corporate limits.

The city is closely associated with the neighboring towns of Kensington and the unincorporated census-designated place, North Bethesda. The Music Center at Strathmore, an arts and theater center, opened in February 2005 in the latter of these two areas and is presently the second home of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, and the Fitzgerald Theatre in Rockville Civic Center Park has provided diverse entertainment since 1960. In 1998, Regal Cinemas opened in Town Center and the city annexed 900 acres of land.

The city also has a brass band in the British style.

The R.E.M. song &quot;(Don&#x27;t Go Back To) Rockville&quot;, released in 1984, was written by Mike Mills about not wanting his girlfriend Ingrid Schorr to return to Rockville, Maryland.

In 1975, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald&#x27;s caskets were reinterred at St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church in Rockville, Maryland where his father, Edward, and a number of Key family members had been buried.

<text>Bethesda () is an unincorporated, census-designated place in southern Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. Located just northwest of Washington, D.C., it is a major business and government center of the Washington metropolitan region and a national center for medical research. According to the 2020 census, the community had a population of 68,056.

==Etymology==
It takes its name from a local church, the Bethesda Meeting House (1820, rebuilt 1849), which in turn took its name from Jerusalem&#x27;s Pool of Bethesda.

== History ==
Bethesda is located in the traditional territory of the indigenous Native Piscataway and Nacotchtank at the time of European colonization. Fur trader Henry Fleet became the first European to visit the area, reaching it by sailing up the Potomac River. He stayed with the Piscataway tribe from 1623 to 1627, either as a guest or prisoner (historical accounts differ). Fleet eventually secured funding for another expedition to the region and was later granted proprietary rights to 2,000 acres of land in the nascent colony and became a member of Maryland&#x27;s colonial legislature. Raids from the Senecas and Susquehannock resulted in the creation of the Maryland division of Rangers in 1694 to patrol the frontier.

Most settlers in colonial Maryland were tenant farmers who paid their rent in tobacco, and colonists continued to expand farther north in search of fertile land. Henry Darnall (1645–1711) surveyed a area in 1694 which became the first land grant in Bethesda. Tobacco farming was the primary way of life in Bethesda throughout the 1700s. The city avoided seeing action during the Revolutionary War, although it became a supply region for the fledgling Continental Navy. The establishment of Washington, D.C., in 1790 deprived Montgomery County of its economic center at Georgetown, although the event had little effect on the small farmers throughout Bethesda.

Between 1805 and 1821, Bethesda became a rural way station after the development of the Washington and Rockville Turnpike, which carried tobacco and other products between Georgetown and Rockville, and north to Frederick. The Bethesda Meeting House, a Presbyterian church, was built in 1820. The church burned in 1849 and was rebuilt the same year about south, and its former location became the Cemetery of the Bethesda Meeting House.

In 1852, the postmaster general established a post office in the area and appointed Rev. A. R. Smith its first postmaster. By 1862, a small settlement had grown around a store and tollhouse along the turnpike known as &quot;Darcy&#x27;s Store&quot; for the store&#x27;s owner, William E. Darcy. It consisted of a blacksmith shop, a church and school, and a few houses and stores. In 1871, postmaster Robert Franck renamed the settlement for the church.

A streetcar line was established in 1890 and suburbanization increased in the early 1900s, and Bethesda grew in population. Communities near railroad lines had grown the fastest during the 19th century. In 1910, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad completed its Georgetown Branch line from Silver Spring to Georgetown, including a storage yard there and multiple sidings serving industries in Bethesda. B&amp;O successor CSX ceased train service on the line in 1985, so the county transformed it into a trail in the rails-to-trails movement. The tracks were removed in 1994, and the first part of the trail was opened in 1998; it has become the most used rail-trail in the United States, averaging over one million users per year.

Subdivisions began to appear on old farmland in the late 19th century, becoming the neighborhoods of Drummond, Woodmont, Edgemoor, and Battery Park. Farther north, several wealthy men made Rockville Pike famous for its mansions. These included Brainard W. Parker (&quot;Cedarcroft&quot;, 1892), James Oyster (&quot;Strathmore&quot;, 1899), George E. Hamilton (&quot;Hamilton House&quot;, 1904; now the Stone Ridge School), Luke I. Wilson (&quot;Tree Tops&quot;, 1926), Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor (&quot;Wild Acres&quot;, 1928–29), and George Freeland Peter (&quot;Stone House&quot;, 1930). In 1930, Armistead Peter&#x27;s pioneering manor house &quot;Winona&quot; (1873) became the clubhouse of the Woodmont Country Club on land that is now part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) campus. Merle Thorpe&#x27;s mansion &quot;Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot; (1927, razed 1948) became the home-in-exile of the Norwegian royal family during World War II.

Before the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, restrictive covenants were used in Bethesda to exclude racial and ethnic minorities—primarily African-Americans, but also Asian-Americans and ethnic groups regarded as &quot;Semitic&quot;, including Armenians, Jews, Iranians, Greeks, Turks, and Syrians. One 1938 restrictive covenant in the Bradley Woods subdivision of Bethesda said, &quot;No part of the land hereby conveyed, shall ever be used, or occupied by or sold, demised, transferred, conveyed, unto, or in trust for, leased, or rented, or given to negroes, or any person or persons of negro blood or extraction or to any person of the Semitic Race, blood, or origin, which racial description shall be deemed to include Armenians, Jews, Hebrews, Persians, Syrians, Greeks and Turks, or to any person of the Mongolian Race, blood, or origin, which racial description shall be deemed to include Chinese, Japanese, and Mongolians, except that this paragraph shall not be held to exclude partial occupancy of the premises by domestic servants of the purchaser or purchasers.&quot; In practice, covenants excluding &quot;Semitic races&quot; were generally used to exclude Jews as Montgomery County did not have notable Armenian, Greek, Syrian, or Turkish populations at the time.

World War II and the subsequent expansion of government fed the rapid growth of Bethesda. Both the National Naval Medical Center (1940–42) and the NIH complex (1948) were built just to the north of the developing downtown, and this drew government contractors, medical professionals, and other businesses to the area. 

Bethesda became the major urban core and employment center of southwestern Montgomery County. This recent vigorous growth followed the 1984 expansion of Metrorail with a station in Bethesda. The Bethesda Metro Center was built over the Red Line metro rail, which opened up further commercial and residential development in the immediate vicinity. In the 2000s, the strict height limits on construction in the District of Columbia led to the development of mid-and high-rise office and residential towers around the Bethesda Metro station.

== Geography ==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (0.38%) is water. The main commercial corridor that passes through Bethesda is Maryland Route 355 (known as Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda and as Rockville Pike and Hungerford Drive in more northern communities), which, to the north, connects Bethesda with the communities of North Bethesda and Rockville, ending, after several name changes, in Frederick. Toward the South, Rockville Pike becomes Wisconsin Avenue near the NIH Campus and continues beyond Bethesda through Chevy Chase, Friendship Heights and into Washington, D.C., ending in Georgetown.

The area commonly known as Downtown Bethesda is centered at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue, Old Georgetown Road and East-West Highway. This intersection is about two and one-half miles from Washington, D.C.&#x27;s western boundary, making Bethesda a close-in suburb of the nation&#x27;s capital. Other focal points of downtown Bethesda include the Woodmont Triangle, bordered by Old Georgetown Road (Maryland Route 187), Woodmont and Rugby Avenues, and the Bethesda Row, centered at the intersection of Woodmont Avenue and Bethesda Avenue. Much of the dense construction in that area followed the opening of the Bethesda station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro rapid transit system, also located at this intersection and the centerpiece of the Bethesda Metro Center development. The Medical Center Metro stop lies about 0.7 miles north of the Bethesda stop, Medical Center, which serves the NIH Campus, the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.

<text>Silver Spring is a census-designated place (CDP) in southeastern Montgomery County, Maryland, United States, near Washington, D.C. Although officially unincorporated, it is an edge city with a population of 81,015 at the 2020 census, making it the fifth-most-populous place in Maryland after Baltimore, Columbia, Germantown, and Waldorf.

Downtown Silver Spring, located next to the northern tip of Washington, D.C., is the oldest and most urbanized area of Silver Spring, surrounded by several inner suburban residential neighborhoods inside the Capital Beltway. Many mixed-use developments combining retail, residential, and office space have been built since 2004.

Silver Spring takes its name from a mica-flecked spring discovered there in 1840 by Francis Preston Blair, who subsequently bought much of the area&#x27;s surrounding land. Acorn Park, south of downtown, is believed to be the site of the original spring.

==Geography==

As an unincorporated census-designated place, Silver Spring&#x27;s boundaries are not consistently defined. As of the 2010 census, the U.S. Census Bureau gives Silver Spring a total area of , which is all land; however, the CDP contains some creeks and small ponds. This definition is a 15% reduction from the used in previous years.

Silver Spring contains the following neighborhoods: Downtown Silver Spring, East Silver Spring, Woodside, Woodside Park, Lyttonsville, North Hills Sligo Park, Long Branch, Indian Spring, Goodacre Knolls, Franklin Knolls, Montgomery Knolls, Clifton Park Village, New Hampshire Estates, Oakview, and Woodmoor.

The U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Postal Service, Silver Spring Urban Planning District, and Greater Silver Spring Chamber of Commerce, each use their own slightly different definitions. The Postal Service in particular assigns Silver Spring mailing addresses to a large swath of eastern Montgomery County sometimes called &quot;Greater Silver Spring&quot;, including Four Corners, Woodmoor, Wheaton, Glenmont, Forest Glen, Forest Glen Park, Aspen Hill, Hillandale, White Oak, Colesville, Colesville Park, Cloverly, Calverton, Briggs Chaney, Greencastle, Northwood Park, Ashton, Sandy Spring, Sunset Terrace, Fairland, Lyttonsville, Kemp Mill, a portion of Langley Park, and a portion of Adelphi. The area that has a Silver Spring mailing address is larger in area than any city in Maryland except Baltimore.

Landmarks in the downtown area include the AFI Silver Theatre, the National Museum of Health and Medicine, a branch of The Fillmore, and the headquarters of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Greater Silver Spring includes the headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in the U.S.

===Parks and recreation===

Four major creeks run through Silver Spring: from west to east, they are Rock Creek, Sligo Creek, Long Branch, and Northwest Branch. Each is surrounded by parks offering hiking trails, playgrounds, picnic areas, and tennis courts. On weekends, roads are closed in the parks for bicycling and walking.

Northwest Branch Park also includes the Rachel Carson Greenway Trail, named after Rachel Carson, the author of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; and a former resident of the area. It continues north to Wheaton Regional Park, in Greater Silver Spring, which is home to the Brookside Gardens.

The Jessup Blair Park, south of downtown, has a soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts, and a picnic area. There are similar local parks throughout the residential parts of the community.

===2010===
&quot;Note: For the 2010 census, the boundaries of the Silver Spring CDP were changed, reducing the land area by approx. 15%. As a result, the population count for 2010 shows a 6.6% decrease, while the population density increased 11%.&quot;

==History==
Prior to European settlement, present-day Silver Spring was inhabited by various Indigenous peoples for approximately 10,000 years, including the Piscataway, an Algonquian-speaking people. The Piscataway may have established a few small villages along the banks of Sligo Creek and Rock Creek.

===19th century===
The Blair, Lee, Jalloh, and Barrie families, three politically active families of the time, are tied to Silver Spring&#x27;s history. In 1840, Francis Preston Blair, who later helped organize the modern Republican Party, along with his daughter, Elizabeth, discovered a spring flowing with chips of mica believed to be the now-dry spring visible at Acorn Park. Blair was looking for a site for his summer home to escape the summer heat of Washington, D.C. Two years later, Blair completed a 20-room mansion he dubbed &quot;Silver Spring&quot; on a country homestead. In 1854, Blair moved to the mansion permanently. The house stood until 1954.

By 1854, Blair&#x27;s son, Montgomery Blair, who became Postmaster General under Abraham Lincoln and represented Dred Scott before the U.S. Supreme Court, built the Falkland house in the area.

By the end of the decade, Elizabeth Blair married Samuel Phillips Lee, third cousin of future Confederate leader Robert E. Lee, and gave birth to a boy, Francis Preston Blair Lee, who went on to become the first popularly elected Senator in U.S. history.

During the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln visited the Silver Spring mansion several times, where he relaxed by playing town ball with Francis P. Blair&#x27;s grandchildren.

In 1864, Confederate States Army General Jubal Early occupied Silver Spring before the Battle of Fort Stevens. After the engagement, fleeing Confederate soldiers razed Montgomery Blair&#x27;s Falkland residence.

At the time, there was a community called Sligo located at the intersection of the Washington-Brookeville Turnpike and the Washington-Colesville-Ashton Turnpike, now named Georgia Avenue and Colesville Road. Sligo included a tollhouse, a store, a post office, and a few homes. The communities of Woodside, Forest Glen, and Linden were founded after the Civil War. These small towns largely lost their separate identities when a post office was established in Silver Spring in 1899.

By the end of the 19th century, the region began to develop into a town of size and importance. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s Metropolitan Branch opened on April 30, 1873, and ran through Silver Spring from Washington, D.C., to Point of Rocks, Maryland.

The first suburban development appeared in 1887 when Selina Wilson divided part of her farm on present-day Colesville Road (U.S. Route 29) and Brookeville Road into five- and ten-acre ( - and m2) plots. In 1892, Francis Preston Blair Lee and his wife, Anne Brooke Lee, gave birth to E. Brooke Lee, who is known as the father of modern Silver Spring for his visionary attitude toward developing the region.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, E. Brooke Lee and his brother, Blair Lee I, founded the Lee Development Company, whose Colesville Road office building remains a downtown fixture. Dale Drive, a winding roadway, was built to provide vehicular access to much of the family&#x27;s substantial real estate holdings. Suburban development continued in 1922 when Woodside Development Corporation created Woodside Park, a neighborhood of plot home sites built on the former Noyes estate in 1923. In 1924, Washington trolley service on Georgia Avenue (present-day Maryland Route 97) across B&amp;O&#x27;s Metropolitan Branch was suspended so that an underpass could be built. The underpass was completed two years later, but trolley service never resumed. It would be rebuilt again in 1948 with additional lanes for automobile traffic, opening the areas to the north for readily accessible suburban development.

Takoma-Silver Spring High School, built in 1924, was the first high school for Silver Spring. The community&#x27;s rapid growth led to the need for a larger school. In 1935, when a new high school building was erected at Wayne Avenue and Sligo Creek Parkway, the school was renamed Montgomery Blair High School. In 1998, the school was moved again, to a new, larger facility at the corner of Colesville Road (U.S. Route 29) and University Boulevard (Maryland Route 193). The former Blair building became a combined middle school and elementary school, housing Silver Spring International Middle School and Sligo Creek Elementary School.

The Silver Spring Shopping Center, built by developer Albert Small and Silver Theatre, designed by theater architect John Eberson, were completed in 1938 at the request of developer William Alexander Julian. The Silver Spring Shopping Center was one of the nation&#x27;s first retail spaces with a street-front parking lot, defying conventional wisdom that merchandise should be in windows closest to the street so that people could see it. The shopping center was purchased in 1944 by real estate developer Sam Eig, who helped attract large retailers to the city.

Before the 1950s, Silver Spring was known as a sundown town, in part because of influential land owners. The North Washington Real Estate Company designed 63 acres to be white-only, written in its deeds to prevent the sale of land to anyone else. The Fair Housing Act outlawed this practice in 1968, almost two decades after &quot;Shelley v. Kramer&quot; made racial covenants unenforceable. A 1939 deed for a property owned by Rozier J. Beech in the Sixteenth Street Village subdivision of Silver Spring said, &quot;No negro, or any person or persons of whose blood or extraction or to any person of the semitic race whose blood or origin of racial description will be deemed to include Armenians, Jews, Hebrews, Persians, Syrians, Greeks and Turks, shall use or occupy any building or any lot, except that this covenant shall not prevent occupancy by domestic servants of a different race domiciled with an owner or tenant.&quot; In practice, covenants excluding &quot;Semitic races&quot; were primarily used to discriminate against Jews, as Montgomery County did not have significant Armenian, Greek, Iranian, or Turkish populations at the time.

In all, housing in more than 10 square miles of greater Silver Spring was blocked off to Blacks, Jews, Armenians, Persians, Turks, and Greeks, who were considered non-white at the time.

By the 1950s, Silver Spring was the second-busiest retail market between Baltimore and Richmond; major retailers included the Hecht Company, J.C. Penney, and Sears, Roebuck and Company. In 1954, the 1842 Blair mansion &quot;Silver Spring&quot; was razed and replaced with the Blair Station post office. 1960 saw the opening of Wheaton Plaza, later called Westfield Wheaton, a shopping center several miles north of downtown Silver Spring. It captured much of the town&#x27;s business, and the downtown area began a long period of decline.

On December 19, 1961, a segment of the Capital Beltway (I-495) was opened to traffic between Georgia Avenue (MD 97) and University Boulevard East (MD 193). On August 17, 1964, the final segment of the Beltway was opened to traffic, and a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held near the New Hampshire Avenue interchange, with a speech by Gov. J. Millard Tawes, who called it a &quot;road of opportunity&quot; for Maryland and the nation.

Washington Metro rail service into Washington, D.C., helped breathe new life into the region starting with the 1978 opening of Silver Spring station. The Metro Red Line followed the right-of-way of the B&amp;O Metropolitan Branch, with the Metro tracks centered between the B&amp;O&#x27;s eastbound and westbound mains. The Red Line heads south to downtown DC from Silver Spring, running at grade before descending into Union Station. By the mid-1990s, the Red Line continued north from the downtown Silver Spring core, entering a tunnel just past the Silver Spring station and running underground to three more stations: Forest Glen, Wheaton, and Glenmont.

Nevertheless, Silver Spring&#x27;s downtown continued to decline in the 1980s. The Hecht Company closed its downtown location in 1987 and moved to Wheaton Plaza while forbidding another department store to rent its old spot. City Place, a multi-level mall, was established in the old Hecht Company building in 1992, but it had difficulty attracting quality anchor stores and gained a reputation as a budget mall. In the mid-1990s, developers considered building a mega-mall and entertainment complex called the American Dream, similar to the Mall of America, in downtown Silver Spring, but were unable to secure funding. A bright spot for the city in the late 1980s and early 1990s was the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) consolidating its headquarters to four new high-rise office buildings near the Silver Spring Metro station.

A February 16, 1996, train collision on the Silver Spring section of the Metropolitan line left 11 people dead. A MARC commuter train bound for Washington Union Station during the Friday evening rush hour collided with the Amtrak &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; train and erupted in flames on a snow-swept stretch of track.

The Maryland State Highway Administration started studies of improvements to the Capital Beltway in 1993, and have continued, off and on, examining a number of alternatives since then, including HOV lanes and high-occupancy toll lanes.

===21st century===

At the beginning of the 21st century, downtown Silver Spring began to see the results of redevelopment. Several city blocks near City Place Mall were rebuilt to accommodate a new outdoor shopping plaza called Downtown Silver Spring. As downtown Silver Spring revived, its 160-year history was celebrated in a 2002 PBS documentary entitled &quot;Silver Spring: Story of an American Suburb&quot;.

In 2003, Discovery Communications moved its headquarters from nearby Bethesda to a new building in downtown Silver Spring. In 2017, Discovery, Inc. CEO David Zaslav announced that the company was relocating to New York City to operate close to their &quot;ad partners on Madison Avenue&quot;, &quot;investors and analysts on Wall Street&quot;, and their &quot;creative and production community&quot;.) 2003 also brought the reopening of the Silver Theatre, as AFI Silver, under the auspices of the American Film Institute.

Beginning in 2004, the downtown redevelopment was marketed locally with the &quot;silver sprung&quot; advertising campaign, which declared on buses and in print ads that Silver Spring had &quot;sprung&quot; and was ready for business. In June 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that downtown was &quot;enjoying a renaissance, a result of public involvement and private investment that is turning it into an arts and entertainment center&quot;.

In 2005, downtown Silver Spring was awarded the silver medal of the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence

In 2007, the downtown Silver Spring area gained attention when an amateur photographer was prohibited from taking photographs in what appeared to be a public street. The land, leased to the Peterson Companies, a developer, for $1, was technically private property. The citizens argued that the Downtown Silver Spring development, partially built with public money, was still public property. After a protest on July 4, 2007, Peterson relented and allowed photography on their property under limited conditions. Peterson also claimed that it could revoke these rights at any time. The company further stated that other activities permitted in public spaces, such as organizing protests or distributing campaign literature, were still prohibited. In response, Montgomery County Attorney Leon Rodriguez said that the street in question, Ellsworth Drive, &quot;constitutes a public forum&quot; and that the First Amendment&#x27;s protection of free speech applies there. In an eight-page letter, Rodriguez wrote, &quot;Although the courts have not definitively resolved the issue of whether the taking, as opposed to the display, of photographs is a protected expressive act, we think it is likely that a court would consider the taking of the photograph to be part of the continuum of action that leads to the display of the photograph and thus also protected by the First Amendment.&quot; The incident was part of a trend in the United States regarding the blurring of public and private spaces in developments built with both public and private funds.

In 2008, construction began on the long-planned Intercounty Connector (ICC), which crosses the upper reaches of Silver Spring. The highway&#x27;s first section opened on February 21, 2011; the entire route was completed by 2012. In July 2010, the Silver Spring Civic Building and Veterans Plaza opened in downtown Silver Spring.

Between 2015 and 2016, the long-struggling City Place Mall was renovated and reopened as Ellsworth Place The old B&amp;O Passenger Station was restored between 2000 and 2002, as recorded in the documentary film &quot;Next Stop: Silver Spring&quot;.

In May 2019, Peterson announced a $10 million renovation of the Downtown Silver Spring development that will include public art and a new outdoor plaza, featuring green space.

==Culture==

Downtown Silver Spring hosts several entertainment, musical, and ethnic festivals, the most notable of which are the Silverdocs documentary film festival held each June and hosted by Discovery Communications and the American Film Institute, an annual Thanksgiving Day Parade (Saturday before Thanksgiving) for Montgomery County. The Silver Spring Jazz Festival is the largest annual event, drawing people to the free festival held on the second Saturday in September. Featuring local jazz artists and a battle of high school bands, the Silver Spring Jazz Festival has featured Wynton Marsalis, Arturo Sandoval, Sérgio Mendes, Aaron Neville, the Mingus Big Band, the Fred Wesley Group, and other jazz music artists.

The Fillmore is a live entertainment and music venue with a capacity of 2000 people. It opened in 2011 in the former JC Penney building on Colesville Road. The venue joins the American Film Institute and Discovery Communications as cornerstones of the downtown Silver Spring&#x27;s arts and entertainment district, and has featured performances by artists Prince Royce, Minus the Bear, Tyga, Wale, Schoolboy Q, Migos, and others. In August 2012 R&amp;B singer Reesa Renee launched her album &quot;Reelease&quot; at the Fillmore.

Downtown Silver Spring is home to the Cultural Arts Center at Montgomery College. The Cultural Arts Center offers a varied set of cultural performances, lectures, films, and conferences. It is a resource for improving cultural literacy, encouraging cross-cultural understanding, and to build bridges between the arts, cultural studies, and other disciplines concerned with the expression of culture.

Dining in Silver Spring is varied, including American, African, Burmese, Ethiopian, Guatemalan, Japanese, Moroccan, Italian, Mexican, Salvadoran, Jamaican, Vietnamese, Lebanese, Thai, Persian, Chinese, Indian, Greek, and fusion restaurants, and national and regional chains.

Silver Spring has several churches, synagogues, temples, and other religious institutions, including the World Headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Silver Spring serves as the primary urban area in Montgomery County and its revitalization has ushered in an eclectic mix of people and ideas, evident in the fact that the flagship high school, Montgomery Blair High School, has no majority group with each major racial and ethnic group claiming a significant percentage.

Silver Spring hosts the American Film Institute Silver Theatre and Culture Center, on Colesville Road. The theatre showcases American and foreign films. Gandhi Brigade, a youth development media project, began in Silver Spring out of the Long Branch neighborhood. Docs in Progress, a non-profit media arts center devoted to the promotion of documentary filmmaking is located at the &quot;Documentary House&quot; in downtown Silver Spring. Silver Spring Stage, an all-volunteer community theater, performs in Woodmoor, approximately north up Colesville Road from the downtown area. Downtown Silver Spring is also home to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce that includes the National Weather Service, the American Nurses Association, and several real estate development, biotechnology, and media and communications companies.

Stevie Nicks of the band Fleetwood Mac has credited Silver Spring as an inspiration for the title of the band&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;Silver Springs&quot;. In a 1998 interview, Nicks said, &quot;I wrote Silver Springs uh, about Lindsey [Buckingham]. And I ~ we were in Maryland somewhere driving under a freeway sign that said Silver Spring, Maryland. And I loved the name. ...Silver Springs sounded like a pretty fabulous place to me. And uh, &#x27;You could be my silver springs...&#x27; that&#x27;s just a whole symbolic thing of what you could have been to me.&quot;

==Transportation==

The major roads in Silver Spring are mostly three- to five-lane highways. The Capital Beltway can be accessed from Georgia Avenue (MD 97), Colesville Road (US 29), and New Hampshire Avenue (MD 650).

The long-planned Intercounty Connector (ICC) (MD-200) toll road opened in three segments between February 2011 and November 2014. ICC interchanges in the Silver Spring area include Georgia Avenue, Layhill Road (MD-182), New Hampshire Avenue, Columbia Pike (US-29) and Briggs Chaney Road.

The multilevel Paul Sarbanes Transit Center in downtown Silver Spring, named in honor of former U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes from Maryland, is served by the MARC Train on the Brunswick Line, Washington Metro on the Red Line at Silver Spring station, Metrobus, Ride On, the free VanGo, intercity Greyhound bus, and local taxi services. The bus terminal is the busiest in the Washington metropolitan area. This transit facility serves nearly passengers daily. The transit center is an expanded version of an older bus, train, and Metro terminal. Begun in October 2008, the expansion, planned to consume $91 million and four years, opened four years late and $50 million over budget on September 20, 2015.

The transit center will also be served by the Purple Line light rail. Under construction by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA), the line is expected to open in late 2027, and will connect Silver Spring with Bethesda to the west, the University of Maryland, College Park to the east, and the Washington Metro&#x27;s New Carrollton station to the southeast.

<doc id="43486" wikidata="Q151030" url="?curid=43486" title="Moulin Rouge">
<text>Moulin Rouge (, ; ) is a cabaret in Paris, on Boulevard de Clichy, at Place Blanche, the intersection of, and terminus of Rue Blanche.

In 1889, the Moulin Rouge was co-founded by Charles Zidler and Joseph Oller, who also owned the Paris Olympia. The original venue was destroyed by fire in 1915, reopening in 1925 after rebuilding. Moulin Rouge is southwest of Montmartre, in the Paris district of Pigalle on Boulevard de Clichy in the 18th &quot;arrondissement&quot;, and has a landmark red windmill on its roof. The closest métro station is Blanche.

Moulin Rouge is best known as the birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. Originally introduced as a seductive dance by the courtesans who operated from the site, the can-can dance revue evolved into a form of entertainment of its own and led to the introduction of cabarets across Europe. Today, the Moulin Rouge is a tourist attraction, offering predominantly musical dance entertainment for visitors from around the world. The club&#x27;s decor still contains much of the romance of &quot;fin de siècle&quot; France.

==History==

===Creation and early success===
On 6 October 1889, the Moulin Rouge opened as the Jardin de Paris, an outdoor garden café-concert, at the foot of the Montmartre hill. Its creator Joseph Oller and his Manager Charles Zidler were formidable businessmen who understood the public&#x27;s tastes. The aim was to attract wealthy individuals to experience the ambiance of the fashionable district of Montmartre, which was perceived as a form of slumming. The elaborate setting, featuring a garden adorned with a large elephant, provided an environment where individuals from various social strata could interact. This included workers, local residents, artists, the middle class, businessmen, stylish women, and tourists passing through Paris. Nicknamed &quot;The First Palace of Women&quot; by Oller and Zidler, the cabaret swiftly garnered significant acclaim. Key factors contributing to its success included:
* Revolutionary auditorium architecture enabling rapid changes of décor and fostering social interaction among all patrons.
* Champagne evenings characterized by lively entertainment and dancing, featuring regularly changing amusing acts like Le Pétomane.
* A new dance, inspired by the quadrille and gaining popularity, known as the Can-can. Dancers performed this energetic dance to a lively rhythm while wearing provocative costumes.
* Prominent dancers from the era included figures such as la Goulue, Jane Avril, la Môme Fromage, Grille d&#x27;Egout, Nini Pattes en l&#x27;Air, Yvette Guilbert, Valentin le désossé, and the clown Cha-U-Kao.
* A favored venue among artists, including Toulouse-Lautrec, whose posters and paintings contributed to the rapid and international renown of the Moulin Rouge.
===Greatest moments===
During its early years, the Moulin Rouge featured extravagant shows inspired by the circus, along with attractions that gained widespread fame, such as Pétomane. Concert-dances were organized daily at 10 pm. Between 1886 and 1910, the comic duo Footit and Chocolat, comprising a white authoritarian clown and a black long-suffering Auguste, gained popularity and were frequently featured on Moulin Rouge posters.
On 19 April 1890, the first revue, &quot;Circassiens et Circassiennes,&quot; debuted. On 26 October 1890, during a private visit to Paris, the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, reserved a table to witness a quadrille at the Moulin Rouge, where La Goulue famously greeted him with the exclamation, &quot;Hey, Wales, the champagne&#x27;s on you!&quot; In 1891, Toulouse-Lautrec created his first poster for the Moulin Rouge, featuring &quot;La Goulue&quot;.
In 1893, the &quot;Bal des Quat&#x27;z&#x27;Arts&quot; sparked scandal with its procession featuring a nude Cleopatra surrounded by young naked women. On 12 November 1897, the Moulin Rouge closed for the first time to mourn the passing of its manager and co-founder, Charles Zidler. Yvette Guilbert paid homage to him, saying, &quot;You have the knack of creating popular pleasure, in the finest sense of the word, of entertaining crowds with subtlety, according to the status of those to be entertained.&quot;
In 1900, the Universal Exhibition attracted visitors from around the world to the Moulin Rouge, solidifying Paris&#x27;s reputation as a city of decadent pleasure. This led to the establishment of imitation &quot;Moulin Rouges&quot; and &quot;Montmartres&quot; in many other countries.

===Operetta and grand shows===
In January 1903, the Moulin Rouge underwent renovation and improvement under the direction of Édouard Niermans, a prominent architect of the Belle Époque era, amongst other works he designed the brasserie Mollard, the Casino de Paris, the Folies Bergère in Paris, the Palace Hôtel in Ostend in Belgium, the rebuilding of the Hôtel du Palais in Biarritz, and the creation of the Hotel Negresco on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice. This included the addition of aperitif concerts, attracting the fashionable elite for dining and entertainment in a luxurious setting.
Until the outbreak of the First World War, the Moulin Rouge became renowned for its operetta performances. Successful shows during this period included Voluptata, La Feuille de Vigne, Le Rêve d&#x27;Egypte, Tais-toi tu m&#x27;affoles, among others, each with evocative titles.
On 3 January 1907, during the performance of Le Rêve d&#x27;Egypte, Colette exchanged scandalous kisses that revealed her connection to the Duchess of Morny, leading to the show being banned.
Mistinguett made her debut at the Moulin Rouge on 29 July 1907 in the Revue de la Femme, showcasing her undeniable talent. She quickly rose to fame, achieving immense success the following year with Max Dearly in La Valse chaloupée. Born into poverty, Mistinguett&#x27;s sharp wit and determination propelled her to become a successful businesswoman, touring extensively across Europe and the United States.
On 9 April 1910, a former lady-in-waiting to Empress Eugénie attended a showing of the Revue Amoureuse at the Moulin Rouge and was so captivated by the faithful recreation of a ceremony for the return of troops from Italy that she exclaimed, &quot;Long Live the Empress!&quot;
Tragically, on 27 February 1915, the Moulin Rouge was destroyed by fire during building works, resulting in a nine-year closure. In 1925, the rebuilt Moulin Rouge reopened its doors to the public.
===Mistinguett years===
Following World War I, Francis Salabert assumed management of the Moulin Rouge. As a businessman rather than a showman, he entrusted Jacques-Charles, a prominent impresario, with revitalizing the cabaret. The Moulin Rouge experienced a resurgence with the performances of stars such as Mistinguett, Jeanne Aubert, and Maurice Chevalier, as well as the introduction of American revues featuring the Hoffmann Girls.

In 1923, composer and conductor Raphaël Beretta proposed a reconstruction of the Moulin Rouge&#x27;s music hall on a larger scale. The iconic mill structure, supported by a central facade adorned with oval dormers, was designed by Gesmar, a 20-year-old set designer whose work became synonymous with the venue.

Jacques-Charles and Mistinguett collaborated on several acclaimed revues, including:

1925: &quot;Revue Mistinguett&quot;

1926: &quot;Ça c&#x27;est Paris&quot;

1928: &quot;Paris qui tourne&quot;

During a 1927 performance, an incident occurred when female dancers emerged from multi-tiered artificial cakes covered in real frosting. The slippery cake cream on their high heels caused them to repeatedly slip and fall on stage, resulting in disruptions to the show.

Mistinguett&#x27;s tenure at the Moulin Rouge produced enduring songs such as &quot;Valencia,&quot; &quot;Ça c&#x27;est Paris&quot; (both by Jose Padilla), &quot;Il m&#x27;a vue nue,&quot; &quot;On m&#x27; suit,&quot; and &quot;La Java de Doudoune,&quot; the latter performed with Jean Gabin.

===After Mistinguett===
In 1929, Mistinguett retired from the stage, leading to the transformation of the Moulin Rouge&#x27;s ballroom into an ultra-modern Night Club.

From June to August 1929, the revue &quot;Lew Leslie&#x27;s Blackbirds&quot;, featuring jazz singer and Broadway star Adelaide Hall, along with a troop of a hundred black artists accompanied by the Jazz Plantation Orchestra, became the hit of the season at the Moulin Rouge.

In 1937, the Cotton Club, renowned in New York, was showcased at the Moulin Rouge, alongside performances by Ray Ventura and his Collegians.

During the Second World War (1939–1945), the Moulin Rouge was highlighted in the German Occupation Guide as a must-visit attraction in Paris. Its stage shows continued for the occupation troops and were mentioned in autobiographies of German officers such as Ernst Jünger and Gerhard Heller. The Germans facilitated &quot;recreational visits&quot; in Paris for their troops, promoting the motto &quot;Jeder einmal in Paris&quot; (everyone once in Paris). The widespread prostitution during the occupation eventually led to the implementation of the Loi Marthe Richard in 1946, which closed bordellos and reduced stage shows to dancing events.

In 1944, shortly after the liberation of Paris, Edith Piaf, who had performed frequently at social gatherings for German forces during the war, returned to the stage at the Moulin Rouge. She was accompanied by Yves Montand, a newcomer chosen to perform with her.

===Renewal===

On 22 June 1951, Georges France, also known as Jo France, founder of the Balajo in Paris, acquired the Moulin Rouge and initiated extensive renovation efforts. Architects Pierre Devinoy, Bernard de La Tour d’Auvergne, and Marion Tournon-Branly were tasked with enhancing and outfitting the new auditorium. The envisioned décor by Jo France, largely executed by Henri Mahé, a prominent designer of the era, remains intact to this day.

The return of evening dances, acts, and the iconic French cancan marked a revival at the Moulin Rouge. On 19 May 1953, the 25th &quot;Bal des Petits Lits Blancs,&quot; organized by novelist Guy des Cars, attracted notable figures such as French President Vincent Auriol and featured Bing Crosby&#x27;s European stage debut. Between 1951 and 1960, the stage saw performances by renowned artists including Luis Mariano, Charles Trénet, and Josephine Baker.

In 1955, Jo France transferred ownership to brothers Joseph and Louis Clérico, proprietors of Le Lido, with Jean Bauchet assuming the managerial role. The tradition of the French cancan continued, choreographed by Ruggero Angeletti. Doris Haug established the &quot;Doris&#x27;s Girls&quot; troop in 1957, initially comprising four girls and later expanding to sixty.

Transformations in 1959 included renovations to the Moulin Rouge&#x27;s kitchens, while the introduction of &quot;The Revue Japonaise&quot; in 1960 showcased Japanese artists and popularized Kabuki in Montmartre. In 1962, Jacki Clérico, son of Joseph Clérico, assumed leadership, ushering in an era of expansion with the enlargement of the auditorium, installation of a giant aquarium, and the introduction of the first aquatic ballet. &quot;The Revue Cancan&quot;, devised by Doris Haug and Ruggero Angeletti, premiered the same year.

Since 1963, following the success of the Frou-Frou revue, Jacki Clérico adopted a tradition of naming revues with titles beginning with the letter F. Throughout these productions, the famed French cancan remained a staple feature:
:* 1963–1965: &quot;Frou-Frou&quot;
:* 1965–1967: &quot;Frisson&quot;
:* 1967–1970: &quot;Fascination&quot;
:* 1970–1973: &quot;Fantastic&quot;
:* 1973–1976: &quot;Festival&quot;
:* 1976–1978: &quot;Follement&quot;
:* 1978–1983: &quot;Frénésie&quot;
:* 1983–1988: &quot;Femmes, femmes, femmes&quot;
:* 1988–1999: &quot;Formidable&quot;
:* Since 1999: &quot;Féerie&quot;

On 7 September 1979, the Moulin Rouge marked its 90th anniversary, reaffirming its status as a prominent fixture in Parisian nightlife. The celebration featured an array of stars, including Ginger Rogers, Thierry Le Luron, Dalida, and Charles Aznavour, among others. Notable events followed, including a special presentation of the show to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on 23 November 1981. The venue hosted renowned performers such as Liza Minnelli in February 1982, followed by gala performances with Dean Martin in July 1984 and Frank Sinatra in September 1984. A milestone occurred on 1 December 1986, when world-renowned dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov premiered an original ballet by Maurice Béjart at the Moulin Rouge.

In February 1988, despite the original building&#x27;s destruction in 1915, the Moulin Rouge celebrated its centenary with the premiere of the revue &quot;Formidable,&quot; a prestigious event attended by Prince Edward. Subsequent events included performances in London and gala celebrations featuring an array of luminaries, including Charles Aznavour, Ella Fitzgerald, and Jerry Lewis. Over the years, the Moulin Rouge continued to host charitable events, such as the Cartier gala in support of the Artists&#x27; Foundation against AIDS in 1994, and the Lancôme gala in 1995. The centenary revue &quot;Formidable&quot; concluded in November 1999, paving the way for the debut of the new revue &quot;Féerie&quot; in December 1999.

In 2008, soloist dancer Aleksandar Josipović served as master of ceremonies at the 53rd Eurovision Song Contest. The venue&#x27;s global reach extended further in February 2009 when it was showcased as part of the Year of France in Brazil and the Rio Carnival on Copacabana Beach. However, on 13 January 2013, Moulin Rouge owner Jacki Clérico passed away, followed by the death of Doris Haug, founder of the Doris&#x27;s Girls, on 10 August 2014. Despite these losses, the Moulin Rouge celebrated its 125th anniversary on 6 October 2014.

On 25 April 2024, the cabaret&#x27;s windmill blades collapsed onto the street, resulting in damage to the facade. No injuries were reported. The windmill was restored on 5 July that year, in time for the Olympic torch relay that passed through the area on 15 July.

<doc id="43487" wikidata="Q207522" url="?curid=43487" title="Probability density function">
<text>In probability theory, a probability density function (PDF), density function, or density of an absolutely continuous random variable, is a function whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a &quot;relative likelihood&quot; that the value of the random variable would be equal to that sample. Probability density is the probability per unit length, in other words, while the &quot;absolute likelihood&quot; for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would be close to one sample compared to the other sample.

More precisely, the PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling &quot;within a particular range of values&quot;, as opposed to taking on any one value. This probability is given by the integral of this variable&#x27;s PDF over that range—that is, it is given by the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range. The probability density function is nonnegative everywhere, and the area under the entire curve is equal to 1.

The terms &quot;probability distribution function&quot; and &quot;probability function&quot; have also sometimes been used to denote the probability density function. However, this use is not standard among probabilists and statisticians. In other sources, &quot;probability distribution function&quot; may be used when the probability distribution is defined as a function over general sets of values or it may refer to the cumulative distribution function, or it may be a probability mass function (PMF) rather than the density. &quot;Density function&quot; itself is also used for the probability mass function, leading to further confusion. In general though, the PMF is used in the context of discrete random variables (random variables that take values on a countable set), while the PDF is used in the context of continuous random variables.

==Example==

Suppose bacteria of a certain species typically live 20 to 30 hours. The probability that a bacterium lives 5 hours is equal to zero. A lot of bacteria live for approximately 5 hours, but there is no chance that any given bacterium dies at exactly 5.00... hours. However, the probability that the bacterium dies between 5 hours and 5.01 hours is quantifiable. Suppose the answer is 0.02 (i.e., 2%). Then, the probability that the bacterium dies between 5 hours and 5.001 hours should be about 0.002, since this time interval is one-tenth as long as the previous. The probability that the bacterium dies between 5 hours and 5.0001 hours should be about 0.0002, and so on.

In this example, the ratio (probability of living during an interval) / (duration of the interval) is approximately constant, and equal to 2 per hour (or 2 hour−1). For example, there is 0.02 probability of dying in the 0.01-hour interval between 5 and 5.01 hours, and (0.02 probability / 0.01 hours) = 2 hour−1. This quantity 2 hour−1 is called the probability density for dying at around 5 hours. Therefore, the probability that the bacterium dies at 5 hours can be written as (2 hour−1) &quot;dt&quot;. This is the probability that the bacterium dies within an infinitesimal window of time around 5 hours, where &quot;dt&quot; is the duration of this window. For example, the probability that it lives longer than 5 hours, but shorter than (5 hours + 1 nanosecond), is (2 hour−1)×(1 nanosecond) ≈ (using the unit conversion nanoseconds = 1 hour).

There is a probability density function &quot;f&quot; with &quot;f&quot;(5 hours) = 2 hour−1. The integral of &quot;f&quot; over any window of time (not only infinitesimal windows but also large windows) is the probability that the bacterium dies in that window.

==Absolutely continuous univariate distributions==
A probability density function is most commonly associated with absolutely continuous univariate distributions. A random variable formula_1 has density formula_2, where formula_2 is a non-negative Lebesgue-integrable function, if:
formula_4

Hence, if formula_5 is the cumulative distribution function of formula_1, then:
formula_7
and (if formula_2 is continuous at formula_9)
formula_10

Intuitively, one can think of formula_11 as being the probability of formula_1 falling within the infinitesimal interval formula_13.

==Formal definition==
(&quot;This definition may be extended to any probability distribution using the measure-theoretic definition of probability.&quot;)

A random variable formula_1 with values in a measurable space formula_15 (usually formula_16 with the Borel sets as measurable subsets) has as probability distribution the pushforward measure &quot;X&quot;∗&quot;P&quot; on formula_15: the density of formula_1 with respect to a reference measure formula_19 on formula_15 is the Radon–Nikodym derivative:
formula_21

That is, &quot;f&quot; is any measurable function with the property that:
formula_22
for any measurable set formula_23

===Discussion===
In the continuous univariate case above, the reference measure is the Lebesgue measure. The probability mass function of a discrete random variable is the density with respect to the counting measure over the sample space (usually the set of integers, or some subset thereof).

It is not possible to define a density with reference to an arbitrary measure (e.g. one can not choose the counting measure as a reference for a continuous random variable). Furthermore, when it does exist, the density is almost unique, meaning that any two such densities coincide almost everywhere.

==Further details==
Unlike a probability, a probability density function can take on values greater than one; for example, the continuous uniform distribution on the interval has probability density for and elsewhere.

The standard normal distribution has probability density
formula_24

If a random variable is given and its distribution admits a probability density function , then the expected value of (if the expected value exists) can be calculated as
formula_25

Not every probability distribution has a density function: the distributions of discrete random variables do not; nor does the Cantor distribution, even though it has no discrete component, i.e., does not assign positive probability to any individual point.

A distribution has a density function if its cumulative distribution function is absolutely continuous. In this case: is almost everywhere differentiable, and its derivative can be used as probability density:
formula_26

If a probability distribution admits a density, then the probability of every one-point set is zero; the same holds for finite and countable sets.

Two probability densities and represent the same probability distribution precisely if they differ only on a set of Lebesgue measure zero.

In the field of statistical physics, a non-formal reformulation of the relation above between the derivative of the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function is generally used as the definition of the probability density function. This alternate definition is the following:

If is an infinitely small number, the probability that is included within the interval is equal to , or:
formula_27

==Link between discrete and continuous distributions==

It is possible to represent certain discrete random variables as well as random variables involving both a continuous and a discrete part with a generalized probability density function using the Dirac delta function. (This is not possible with a probability density function in the sense defined above, it may be done with a distribution.) For example, consider a binary discrete random variable having the Rademacher distribution—that is, taking −1 or 1 for values, with probability each. The density of probability associated with this variable is:
formula_28

More generally, if a discrete variable can take different values among real numbers, then the associated probability density function is:
formula_29
where formula_30 are the discrete values accessible to the variable and formula_31 are the probabilities associated with these values.

This substantially unifies the treatment of discrete and continuous probability distributions. The above expression allows for determining statistical characteristics of such a discrete variable (such as the mean, variance, and kurtosis), starting from the formulas given for a continuous distribution of the probability.

== Families of densities ==
It is common for probability density functions (and probability mass functions) to be parametrized—that is, to be characterized by unspecified parameters. For example, the normal distribution is parametrized in terms of the mean and the variance, denoted by formula_19 and formula_33 respectively, giving the family of densities
formula_34
Different values of the parameters describe different distributions of different random variables on the same sample space (the same set of all possible values of the variable); this sample space is the domain of the family of random variables that this family of distributions describes. A given set of parameters describes a single distribution within the family sharing the functional form of the density. From the perspective of a given distribution, the parameters are constants, and terms in a density function that contain only parameters, but not variables, are part of the normalization factor of a distribution (the multiplicative factor that ensures that the area under the density—the probability of &quot;something&quot; in the domain occurring— equals 1). This normalization factor is outside the kernel of the distribution.

Since the parameters are constants, reparametrizing a density in terms of different parameters to give a characterization of a different random variable in the family, means simply substituting the new parameter values into the formula in place of the old ones.

== Densities associated with multiple variables ==

For continuous random variables , it is also possible to define a probability density function associated to the set as a whole, often called joint probability density function. This density function is defined as a function of the variables, such that, for any domain in the -dimensional space of the values of the variables , the probability that a realisation of the set variables falls inside the domain is
formula_35

If is the cumulative distribution function of the vector , then the joint probability density function can be computed as a partial derivative
formula_36

===Marginal densities===
For , let be the probability density function associated with variable alone. This is called the marginal density function, and can be deduced from the probability density associated with the random variables by integrating over all values of the other variables:
formula_37

===Independence===

Continuous random variables admitting a joint density are all independent from each other if
formula_38

===Corollary===

If the joint probability density function of a vector of random variables can be factored into a product of functions of one variable
formula_39
(where each is not necessarily a density) then the variables in the set are all independent from each other, and the marginal probability density function of each of them is given by
formula_40

===Example===

This elementary example illustrates the above definition of multidimensional probability density functions in the simple case of a function of a set of two variables. Let us call formula_41 a 2-dimensional random vector of coordinates : the probability to obtain formula_41 in the quarter plane of positive and is
formula_43

==Function of random variables and change of variables in the probability density function==

If the probability density function of a random variable (or vector) is given as , it is possible (but often not necessary; see below) to calculate the probability density function of some variable . This is also called a &quot;change of variable&quot; and is in practice used to generate a random variable of arbitrary shape using a known (for instance, uniform) random number generator.

It is tempting to think that in order to find the expected value , one must first find the probability density of the new random variable . However, rather than computing
formula_44
one may find instead
formula_45

The values of the two integrals are the same in all cases in which both and actually have probability density functions. It is not necessary that be a one-to-one function. In some cases the latter integral is computed much more easily than the former. See Law of the unconscious statistician.

===Scalar to scalar===

Let formula_46 be a monotonic function, then the resulting density function is
formula_47

Here denotes the inverse function.

This follows from the fact that the probability contained in a differential area must be invariant under change of variables. That is,
formula_48
or
formula_49

For functions that are not monotonic, the probability density function for is
formula_50
where is the number of solutions in for the equation formula_51, and formula_52 are these solutions.

===Vector to vector===

Suppose is an -dimensional random variable with joint density . If , where is a bijective, differentiable function, then has density :
formula_53
with the differential regarded as the Jacobian of the inverse of , evaluated at .

For example, in the 2-dimensional case , suppose the transform is given as , with inverses , . The joint distribution for y = (&quot;y&quot;1, y2) has density
formula_54

===Vector to scalar===

Let formula_55 be a differentiable function and formula_56 be a random vector taking values in formula_57, formula_58 be the probability density function of formula_56 and formula_60 be the Dirac delta function. It is possible to use the formulas above to determine formula_61, the probability density function of formula_62, which will be given by
formula_63

This result leads to the law of the unconscious statistician:
formula_64
which is an upper triangular matrix with ones on the main diagonal, therefore its determinant is 1. Applying the change of variable theorem from the previous section we obtain that
formula_65
which if marginalized over formula_9 leads to the desired probability density function.

==Sums of independent random variables==
The probability density function of the sum of two independent random variables and , each of which has a probability density function, is the convolution of their separate density functions:
formula_67

It is possible to generalize the previous relation to a sum of N independent random variables, with densities :
formula_68

This can be derived from a two-way change of variables involving and , similarly to the example below for the quotient of independent random variables.

==Products and quotients of independent random variables==
Given two independent random variables and , each of which has a probability density function, the density of the product and quotient can be computed by a change of variables.

===Example: Quotient distribution===
To compute the quotient of two independent random variables and , define the following transformation:
formula_69

Then, the joint density can be computed by a change of variables from &quot;U&quot;,&quot;V&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;,&quot;Z&quot;, and can be derived by marginalizing out from the joint density.

The inverse transformation is
formula_70

The absolute value of the Jacobian matrix determinant formula_71 of this transformation is:
formula_72

Thus:
formula_73

And the distribution of can be computed by marginalizing out :
formula_74

This method crucially requires that the transformation from &quot;U&quot;,&quot;V&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;,&quot;Z&quot; be bijective. The above transformation meets this because can be mapped directly back to , and for a given the quotient is monotonic. This is similarly the case for the sum , difference and product .

Exactly the same method can be used to compute the distribution of other functions of multiple independent random variables.

===Example: Quotient of two standard normals===
Given two standard normal variables and , the quotient can be computed as follows. First, the variables have the following density functions:
formula_75

We transform as described above:
formula_69

This leads to:
formula_77

This is the density of a standard Cauchy distribution.

<doc id="43488" wikidata="Q645767" url="?curid=43488" title="Rave">
<text>A rave (from the verb: &quot;&quot;) is a dance party at a warehouse, club, or other public or private venue, typically featuring performances by DJs playing electronic dance music. The style is most associated with the early 1990s dance music scene when DJs played at illegal events in musical styles dominated by electronic dance music from a wide range of sub-genres, including drum and bass, dubstep, trap, break, happy hardcore, trance, techno, hardcore, house, and alternative dance. Occasionally live musicians have been known to perform at raves, in addition to other types of performance artists such as go-go dancers and fire dancers. The music is amplified with a large, powerful sound reinforcement system, typically with large subwoofers to produce a deep bass sound. The music is often accompanied by laser light shows, projected coloured images, visual effects and fog machines.

Fuelled by the emerging dance scene, and spearheaded by acid house music and underground bands such as The Prodigy, many of the &quot;acid house&quot; parties were held in squats during the late 80s. Well known locations such as the &quot;Dole House&quot; (Peckham), the abandoned bus station and the squatted children&#x27;s home in Camberwell known as Groove Park had crowds of over a thousand. Full Moon parties were organised at Groove Park by Pete Marland (who went on to start the dance scene in Western Ireland in the early 90s) and multiple events went on for over a year as an Art Collective sanctioned by locals. The Times&#x27; first colour supplement carried an article about the dance scene at Groove Park, though some of the organisers did not want to be photographed. While some raves may be small parties held at nightclubs or private homes, some raves have grown to immense size, such as the large festivals and events featuring multiple DJs and dance areas (e.g., the Castlemorton Common Festival in 1992).

Some electronic dance music festivals have features of raves, but on a larger, often commercial scale. Raves may last for a long time, with some events continuing for twenty-four hours, and lasting all through the night. Law enforcement raids and anti-rave laws have presented a challenge to the rave scene in many countries. This is due to the association of rave culture with illegal drugs such as MDMA (often referred to as a &quot;club drug&quot; or &quot;party drug&quot; along with MDA), amphetamine, LSD, GHB, ketamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, and cannabis. In addition to drugs, raves often make use of non-authorized, secret venues, such as squat parties at unoccupied homes, unused warehouses, or aircraft hangars. These concerns are often attributed to a type of moral panic surrounding rave culture.
==History==

===Origin (1950s–1970s)===
In the late 1950s in London, England, the term &quot;rave&quot; was used to describe the &quot;wild bohemian parties&quot; of the Soho beatnik set. Jazz musician Mick Mulligan, known for indulging in such excesses, had the nickname &quot;king of the ravers&quot;. In 1958, Buddy Holly recorded the hit &quot;Rave On&quot;, citing the madness and frenzy of a feeling and the desire for it never to end. The word &quot;rave&quot; was later used in the burgeoning mod youth culture of the early 1960s as the way to describe any wild party in general. People who were gregarious party animals were described as &quot;ravers&quot;. Pop musicians such as Steve Marriott of Small Faces and Keith Moon of the Who were self-described &quot;ravers&quot;.
Presaging the word&#x27;s subsequent 1980s association with electronic music, the word &quot;rave&quot; was a common term used regarding the music of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelia bands (most notably the Yardbirds, who released an album in the United States called &quot;Having a Rave Up&quot;). Along with being an alternative term for partying at such garage events in general, the &quot;rave-up&quot; referred to a specific crescendo moment near the end of a song where the music was played faster, more heavily and with intense soloing or elements of controlled feedback. It was later part of the title of an electronic music performance event held on 28 January 1967 at London&#x27;s Roundhouse titled the &quot;Million Volt Light and Sound Rave&quot;. The event featured the only known public airing of an experimental sound collage created for the occasion by Paul McCartney of the Beatles – the legendary &quot;Carnival of Light&quot; recording.

With the rapid change of British pop culture from the mod era of 1963–1966 to the hippie era of 1967 and beyond, the term fell out of popular usage. The Northern soul movement is cited by many as being a significant step towards the creation of contemporary club culture and of the superstar DJ culture of the 2000s. As in contemporary club culture, Northern soul DJs built up a following based on satisfying the crowd&#x27;s desires for music that they could not hear anywhere else. Many argue that Northern soul was instrumental in creating a network of clubs, DJs, record collectors and dealers in the UK, and was the first music scene to provide the British charts with records that sold entirely on the strength of club play. A technique employed by northern soul DJs in common with their later counterparts was the sequencing of records to create euphoric highs and lows for the crowd; DJ Laurence &#x27;Larry&#x27; Proxton was known for using this method. DJ personalities and their followers involved in the original Northern soul movement went on to become important figures in the house and dance music scenes. During the 1970s and early 1980s until its resurrection, the term was not in vogue, one notable exception being in the lyrics of the song &quot;Drive-In Saturday&quot; by David Bowie (from his 1973 album &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;) which includes the line, &quot;It&#x27;s a crash course for the ravers.&quot; Its use during that era would have been perceived as a quaint or ironic use of bygone slang: part of the dated 1960s lexicon along with words such as &quot;groovy&quot;.

The perception of the word &quot;rave&quot; changed again in the late 1980s when the term was revived and adopted by a new youth culture, possibly inspired by the use of the term in Jamaica.

===Acid house (1980s)===
In the mid to late 1980s, a wave of psychedelic and other electronic dance music, most notably acid house music, emerged from acid house music parties in the mid-to-late 1980s in the Chicago area in the United States. After Chicago acid house artists began experiencing overseas success, acid house quickly spread and caught on in the United Kingdom within clubs, warehouses and free-parties, first in Manchester in the mid-1980s and then later in London. In the late 1980s, the word &quot;rave&quot; was adopted to describe the subculture that grew out of the acid house movement. Activities were related to the party atmosphere of Ibiza, a Mediterranean island in Spain, frequented by British, Italian, Greek, Irish and German youth on vacation, who would hold raves and dance parties.

===Growth (1990s–present)===
By the 1990s, genres such as acid, breakbeat hardcore, hardcore, happy hardcore, gabber, drum and bass, post-industrial and electronica were all being featured at raves, both large and small. There were mainstream events which attracted thousands of people (up to 25,000 instead of the 4,000 that came to earlier warehouse parties). Acid house music parties were first re-branded &quot;rave parties&quot; in the media, during the summer of 1989 by Genesis P-Orridge during a television interview; however, the ambience of the rave was not fully formed until the early 1990s. In 1990, raves were held &quot;underground&quot; in several cities, such as Berlin, Milan and Patras, in basements, warehouses and forests.

British politicians responded with hostility to the emerging rave party trend. Politicians spoke out against raves and began to fine promoters who held unauthorised parties. Police crackdowns on these often unauthorised parties drove the rave scene into the countryside. The word &quot;rave&quot; somehow caught on in the UK to describe common semi-spontaneous weekend parties occurring at various locations linked by the brand new M25 London orbital motorway that ringed London and the Home Counties; it was this that gave the band Orbital their name. These ranged from former warehouses and industrial sites in London, to fields and country clubs in the countryside.

==Characteristics==

===Music===

Rave music may either refer to the late 1980s/early 1990s genres of house, new beat, breakbeat, acid house, techno and hardcore techno, which were the first genres of music to be played at rave parties, or to any other genre of electronic dance music (EDM) that may be played at a rave.

The genre &quot;rave&quot;, also known as hardcore (not to be confused with other &quot;hardcore&quot; music genres) by early ravers, first appeared amongst the UK &quot;acid&quot; movement during the late 1980s at warehouse parties and other underground venues, as well as on UK pirate radio stations. Another genre called &quot;rave&quot; during the early 1990s, was the Belgian hardcore techno music that emerged from new beat, when techno became the main style in the Belgian EDM scene.

The &quot;rave&quot; genre would develop into oldschool hardcore, which lead onto newer forms of rave music such as drum and bass, 2-step and happy hardcore as well as other hardcore techno genres, such as gabber and hardstyle.

Rave music is usually presented in a DJ mix set, although live performances are not uncommon.

Styles of music include:
*Breakbeat: Breakbeat music (or breaks for short) refers to any form of rave music with breakbeats, this may range from breakbeat hardcore to nu skool breaks, including genres such as hardstep and breakcore cross over into the hardcore techno sound. Fusions of house and trance also exist but the drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass still remains the most popular form of breakbeat played at rave parties.
*Drum and bass: Drum and bass music refers to a music genre with a very specific sound of four significant notes called breakbeat, that serves as a bassline for the song – that&#x27;s why most drum and bass songs use 170 – 176 BPM, most frequently specifically 174 BPM. Drum and bass includes multiple large subgenres, those who are frequently played at raves include liquid (known for harmonic vocals, less aggressive bass drops and emotional atmosphere), classic dancefloor (energetic and overall positive party music, sometimes even drum and bass remixes of popular songs), jump-up (a less complicated beat, sometimes using machine-like sounds, amplified for consumers of heavier music) and neurofunk (almost sci-fi like subgenre of a heavy and dark drum and bass, only rarely using well-known samples or even traditional music melodies).
*Electro: Electro and techno are two genres which largely featured psychedelic sounds and are largely considered the earliest forms of electronic dance music genres to use the term &quot;rave music&quot; in respect to its modern terminological use. Techno sometimes crosses boundaries with house music, hence the genres trance and acid techno. Miami bass and crunk is sometimes included as &quot;electro&quot;.
*Free tekno: This style of electronic music started in the early 1990s and was mostly played in illegal parties hosted by sound systems, such as Spiral Tribe, Desert Storm, Hekate, Heretik, in warehouse, dismissed buildings, or even illegal open-air festivals, called Teknivals. It takes inspiration from various other genres, and mainly focuses on quick beats, 170/200 bpm, acid bassline, mentals sounds, and often samples taken from movies, popular songs or many other different media sources.
*Gqom: Gqom music, heavily influenced by techno and broken beat, features diverse rhythmic patterns,subgenres and styles. It incorporates drone sounds to create a hypnotic or trance-like effect. Taxi kick is occasionally tailored by some record producers particularly for illegal raves.
*Hardcore techno: Any hard dance genre that was influenced by the rave genre, usually these genres have a distorted kick drum, and a 4/4 rhythm. Happy hardcore blended the Dutch hardcore sound with Eurodance and bubblegum pop, the genre (also known as &quot;happycore&quot; for short) featured pitched-up vocals and a less distorted 4/4 beat. Trancecore also exists and is a less vocal fusion of happy hardcore with trance music, however hardstyle is a more pure form of the trance/hardcore genre since it retains the hardcore sound.
*House music: House music, especially acid house, is the first genre of music to be played at the earliest raves, during the Second Summer of Love. House is a genre of electronic dance music that originated out of the 1980s African-American and Latino disco scene in Chicago. House music uses a constant bass drum on every beat, electronic drum machine hi-hats and synth basslines. There are many subgenres of house music (found below). Since house was originally club music, there are many forms of it, some more appropriate to be played at raves than others. In the UK, subgenres such as UK funky, speed garage and dubstep emerged from garage house. Many &quot;pop house&quot; club music producers branded themselves as &quot;house music&quot;, however, so in rave culture it is often disputed whether pop house should be considered as a subgenre of house. &quot;Rave house&quot; is a subgenre label of house music that originated from the styles of house that were typically played in the rave scene of the 1993–1999 period. It is a term used by the general population who do not follow the house or trance scene specifically, but identify certain house records as &quot;rave music&quot;. It is a loose term that generally identifies progressive house, hard house or trance house styles (often instrumental with no words) that one would imagine being played at a large rave.
*Industrial dance: Industrial is a goth/rock/punk related genre. While the genre is not usually considered rave music in itself, it is often fused with rave music genres. Industrial is the origin of many sounds found in rave music; it is one of the first genres that took the sounds that are now popular in rave music such as &quot;acid&quot; as its musical backdrop. Industrial music fans are usually considered rivetheads and do not tend to call themselves ravers.
*Trance music: Trance music in its most popular and modern form is an offshoot of house music that originated from the acid house movement and rave scene in the late 1980s. The history of trance music is complicated to refer to, as multiple generations of listeners and musicians have influenced the genre. The term &quot;trance&quot; was (and still to this day by many) used interchangeably with &quot;progressive house&quot; in the early rave years (1990–1994).
Downtempo and less dance-oriented styles which are sometimes called chill-out music, that might be heard in a rave &quot;chill-out&quot; room or at a rave that plays slower electronic music includes:
* Ambient, minimalist and computer music – Brian Eno, Mike Oldfield, Harold Budd, ATB, the Orb, Biosphere
* Dubstep and breakstep – Magnetic Man, Eskmo, and Burial
* Electro, glitch, techno, experimental hip hop and industrial hip hop – Flying Lotus, Juan Atkins, MARRS, Dopplereffekt, Egyptian Lover, Afrika Bambaataa, Techno Animal, Coldcut, the Glitch Mob and Kraftwerk
* Gqom tech, sgubhu and 3-step – DJ Tira, and Mr Thela
* IDM – Aphex Twin, Autechre and Boards of Canada
* UK garage and grime – Todd Edwards, Grant Nelson, Sunship, Wookie, So Solid Crew, Roll Deep, Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Plastician

===Location===
Raves have historically referred to grassroots organised, anti-establishment and unlicensed all‐night dance parties. Prior to the commercialisation of the rave scene, when large legal venues became the norm for these events, the location of the rave was kept secret until the night of the event, usually being communicated through answering machine messages, mobile messaging, secret flyers, and websites. This level of secrecy, necessary for avoiding any interference by the police, also on account of the illicit drug use, enabled the ravers to use locations they could stay in for ten hours at a time. It promoted the sense of deviance and removal from social control. In the 2000s, this level of secrecy still exists in the underground rave scene. However &quot;after-hours&quot; clubs, as well as large outdoor events, create a similar type of alternate atmosphere, but focus much more on vibrant visual effects, such as props and décor. In more recent years, large commercial events are held at the same locations year after year with similar reoccurring themes every year. Events like Electric Daisy Carnival and Tomorrowland are typically held at the same venue that holds mass numbers of people.

Some raves make use of pagan symbolism. Modern raving venues attempt to immerse the raver in a fantasy-like world. Indigenous imagery and spirituality can be characteristic in the Raving ethos. In both the New Moon and Gateway collectives, &quot;pagan altars are set up, sacred images from primitive cultures decorate the walls, and rituals of cleansing are performed over the turntables and the dance floor&quot; This type of spatial strategy is an integral part of the raving experience because it sets the initial &quot;vibe&quot; in which the ravers will immerse themselves. This said &quot;vibe&quot; is a concept in the raver ethos that represents the allure and receptiveness of an environment&#x27;s portrayed and or innate energy. The landscape is an integral feature in the composition of rave, much like it is in pagan rituals. For example, The Numic Ghost Dancers rituals were held on specific geographical sites, considered to hold powerful natural flows of energy. These sites were later represented in the rhythmic dances, to achieve a greater level of connectivity.

The Falls festival in Byron Bay features a rave party hidden behind a washing machine in a laundromat.

====Notable venues====
The following is an incomplete list of venues associated with the rave subculture:
===Dancing===
A sense of participation in a group event is among the chief appeals of rave music and dancing to pulsating beats is its immediate outlet. Raving in itself is a syllabus-free dance, whereby the movements are not predefined and the dance is performed randomly, dancers take immediate inspiration from the music, their mood and watching other people dancing. Thus, the electronic, rave and club dances, also known as Post-Internet Dances refer to the street dance styles that evolved alongside electronic music culture.

A common feature shared by all these dances, along with being originated at clubs, raves and music festivals around the world and in different years, is that when YouTube and other social media started to become popular (around 2006), these dances began to be popularised by videos of raves.

*Hakken
*Melbourne Shuffle 
*Gloving
*Glowsticking
*Jumpstyle
*Electro dance
*Rebolation

===Attire===

Since the late 1980s, rave fashion has undergone constant evolution with each new generation of ravers. Many of the rave fashion trends have appeared internationally, but there were also individual developments from region to region and from scene to scene.

At early rave parties, often costume-like clothes and garments with signal color look such as protective suits, safety vests, dust and gas masks were worn and combined with accessories such as vacuum cleaners or cyberpunk inspired goggles. Clothing with slogans such as &quot;Peace, Love, Unity&quot; and smiley-face T-shirts first appeared with the acid house movement of the 1980s. Further popular themes of the early rave scene were plastic aesthetics, various fetish styles, DIY, 1970s, second-hand optics, retro sportswear (such as Adidas tracksuits), sex (showing much skin and nudity, e.g. wearing transparent or crop tops), war (e.g. in the form of combat boots or camouflage trousers), and science fiction.

Common fashion styles of the 1990s include tight-fitting nylon shirts, tight nylon quilted vests, bell-bottoms, neoprene jackets, studded belts, platform shoes, jackets, scarves and bags made of flokati fur, fluffy boots and phat pants, often in bright and neon colours. Also gaudy coloured hair, dreadlocks, tattoos and piercings came into fashion with ravers. Widespread accessories included wristbands and collars, whistles, pacifiers, white gloves, glow sticks, feather boas, oversized sunglasses, and record bags made of truck tarpaulins. In the early 1990s the first commercial rave fashion trends developed from this, which were quickly taken up by the fashion industry and marketed under the term &quot;clubwear&quot;. Different dress codes also evolved in the various sub-scenes of the rave culture. For example, the typical gabber or psytrance raver dressed significantly different from &quot;normal&quot; ravers, but common basic features remained recognisable.

Since the 2000s, the clothing style of the rave culture remains heterogeneous, as do its followers. Particularly in North America, rave fashion continues to be characterised by colourful clothing and accessories, most notably the &quot;kandi&quot; jewellery that fluoresces under ultraviolet light. They contain words or phrases that are unique to the raver and that they can choose to trade with each other using &quot;PLUR&quot; (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect). This style of attire was again taken up by the fashion industry and marketed as &quot;rave fashion&quot; or &quot;festival fashion&quot;, now includling all kinds of accessories to create unique looks depending on event. In contrast to this and starting at Berlin techno clubs like Berghain in the 2000s, a strictly black style, partly borrowed from the dark scene, has established itself within parts of the techno scene. Certain rave events such as Sensation also have a strict minimalistic dress policy, either all white or black attire.

===Light shows===

Some ravers participate in one of four light-oriented dances, called &quot;glowsticking&quot;, &quot;glowstringing&quot;, &quot;gloving&quot;, and &quot;lightshows&quot;. Of the four types of light-orientated dances, gloving in particular has evolved far beyond the rave culture. Other types of light-related dancing include LED lights, flash-lights and blinking strobe lights. LEDs come in various colours with different settings.
Gloving has evolved into a separate dance form that has grown exponentially in the last couple of years early 2010. Glovers use their fingers and hands to move with the beat of the music. And they use the color to create patterns and have different speed settings for the lights on their gloves. These components give the glove artist different ways to fascinate spectators of their light shows. The use of lights can improve the way people react during the songs or throughout the concert itself. Since then the culture has extended to all ages, ranging from kids in their early teens to college students and more. The traditional Rave lights are limited now, but many stores have developed newer, brighter, and more advanced version of lights with a plethora of colours and modes—modes include solid, stribbon, strobe, dops, hyper flash, and other variations.

===Drug use===

Among the various elements of 1970s disco subculture that ravers drew on, in addition to basing their scene around dance music mixed by DJs, ravers also inherited the positive attitude towards using club drugs to &quot;enhanc[e]...the sensory experience&quot; of dancing to loud music. The state of mind referred to as &quot;ecstasy&quot; (not to be confused with the slang term for MDMA) sought by ravers has been described as &quot;a result of when various factors harmonise the ego with the other elements such as place and music and [one] enter[s] a &quot;one state&quot; where [they] cannot distinguish what is material or not, where things enter into syntony and constitute a unique moment, precisely the kind sought in medi[t]ation&quot;.

However, disco dancers and ravers preferred different drugs. Whereas 1970s disco scene members preferred cocaine and the depressant/sedative Quaaludes, ravers preferred MDMA, 2C-B, amphetamine, and other pills. According to the FBI, raves are one of the most popular venues where club drugs are distributed, and as such feature a prominent drug subculture. Club drugs include MDMA (more commonly known as &quot;ecstasy&quot;, &quot;E&quot; or &quot;molly&quot;), 2C-B (more commonly known as &quot;nexus&quot;), amphetamine (commonly referred to as &quot;speed&quot;), GHB (commonly referred to as &quot;fantasy&quot; or &quot;liquid E&quot;), cocaine (commonly referred to as &quot;coke&quot;), DMT, and LSD (commonly referred to as &quot;lucy&quot; or &quot;acid&quot;).

&quot;Poppers&quot; is the street name for alkyl nitrites (the most well-known being amyl nitrite), which are inhaled for their intoxicating effects, notably the &quot;rush&quot; or &quot;high&quot; they can provide. Nitrites originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open, which led to the nickname &quot;poppers.&quot; The drug became popular in the US first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s and then at dance and rave venues in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, synthetic phenethylamines such as 2C-I, 2C-B and DOB have been referred to as club drugs due to their stimulating and psychedelic nature (and their chemical relationship with MDMA). By late 2012, derivates of the psychedelic 2C-X drugs, the NBOMes and especially 25I-NBOMe, had become common at raves in Europe. In the U.S., some law enforcement agencies have branded the subculture as a drug-centric culture, as rave attendees have been known to use drugs such as cannabis, 2C-B, and DMT.

Since the early 2000s, medical professionals have acknowledged and addressed the problem of the increasing consumption of alcoholic drinks and club drugs (such as MDMA, cocaine, rohypnol, GHB, ketamine, PCP, LSD, and methamphetamine) associated with rave culture among adolescents and young adults in the Western world. Studies have shown that adolescents are more likely than young adults to use multiple drugs, and the consumption of club drugs is highly associated with the presence of criminal behaviors and recent alcohol abuse or dependence. In May 2007, Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, advocated drug testing on highways as a countermeasure against drug use at raves.
Much of the controversy, moral panic, and law enforcement attention directed at rave culture and its association with drug use may be due to reports of drug overdoses (particularly MDMA) at raves, concerts, and festivals.

==History by country==

=== Belgium ===
The Belgian rave scene and sound have their roots in the late 1980s Belgian EBM and New Beat scenes.

Originally created by DJs slowing down gay Hi-NRG 45rpm records to 33rpm to create a trance-dance groove, New Beat evolved into a native form of hardcore techno in the 1990s with the introduction of techno records played at their original speeds or even slightly accelerated. This brutal new hardcore style spread throughout the European rave circuit and penetrated the pop charts.

The musical contribution of Brooklyn&#x27;s DJ-producer Joey Beltram to R&amp;S Records, run by Renaat Vandepapeliere, was instrumental in the development of iconic Belgian techno sounds and anthems.

=== Canada ===
Exodus Productions was arguably the first production company in Canada to throw regular rave style events at the warehouse space known as 23 Hop, located at 318 Richmond Street West in Toronto&#x27;s Entertainment District. The first party was held on 31 August 1991. Multiple production companies would quickly follow suit, and the rave scene would soon explode into a massive scene, with 23 Hop as the initial launching pad, until its closure in 1995. The documentary film &quot;The Legend of 23 Hop&quot; highlighted the early stages of Exodus and similarly modelled production companies. Notable DJs that performed at 23 Hop included Moby, Mark Oliver, Dino &amp; Terry, Sean L., Dr. No, Malik X, DJ Ruffneck, Jungle PhD, Kenny Glasgow, Matt C, John E, Danny Henry and David Crooke.

In 2001 Calgary, Alberta became the first major municipality in Canada to pass a bylaw with respect to raves. The intent of the bylaw was to ensure that raves would be safe for participants, and also not unduly disruptive to adjacent neighbourhoods. The bylaw was created in consultation with representatives from the municipality, the province of Alberta, and the rave community.

===Germany===

In West Germany and West Berlin, a substantial acid house scene had established itself in the late 1980s. In the West Berlin club Ufo, an illegal party venue located in the basement of an old apartment building, the first acid house parties took place in 1988. In Munich at this time, the &quot;Negerhalle&quot; (1983–1989) and the &quot;ETA-Halle&quot; established themselves as the first acid house clubs in temporarily used, dilapidated industrial halls, marking the beginning of the so-called hall culture in Germany. In July 1989, the first Love Parade took place in West Berlin.

Immediately after the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November 1989, free underground techno parties mushroomed in East Berlin. According to East German DJ Paul van Dyk the techno-based rave scene was a major force in re-establishing social connections between East and West Germany during the unification period. Soon the first techno clubs emerged in East Berlin such as the Tresor (est. 1991), the &quot;Planet&quot; (1991–1993), and the Bunker (1992–1996). In Frankfurt, the Omen opened in 1988, which under its operator Sven Väth became the center of the scene in the Rhein-Main area in the following years. In 1990, the Babalu Club opened in Munich, introducing the concept of afterhours in Germany.

In the late 1990s, the venues &quot;Tresor&quot; and E-Werk (1993–1997) in Berlin, &quot;Omen&quot; (1988–1998) and Dorian Gray (1978–2000) in Frankfurt, Ultraschall (1994–2003), KW – Das Heizkraftwerk (1996–2003) and Natraj Temple (1996–2008) in Munich, as well as &quot;Stammheim&quot; (1994–2002) in Kassel, had established themselves as the most renowned techno clubs in Germany.

Parallel to the established club scene, illegal raves remained an integral part of the German rave scene throughout the 1990s. In urbanised Germany illegal raves and techno parties often preferred industrial sceneries such as decommissioned power stations, factories, the canalisation or former military properties of the cold war.

In the course of the 1990s, rave culture became part of a new youth movement in Germany and Europe. DJs and electronic-music producers such as WestBam proclaimed the existence of a &quot;raving society&quot; and promoted electronic music as legitimate competition for rock and roll. Indeed, electronic dance music and rave subculture became mass movements. Since the mid-1990s, raves had tens of thousands of attendees, youth magazines featured styling tips, and television networks launched music magazines on house and techno music. The annual Love Parade festivals in Berlin and later the Metropolitan Ruhr area repeatedly attracted more than one million party-goers between 1997 and 2010. Dozens of other annual technoparades took place in Germany and Central Europe in the 1990s and early 2000s, the largest ones being Union Move, Generation Move, Reincarnation and Vision Parade as well as Street Parade and Lake Parade in Switzerland. Large commercial raves since the nineties include Mayday, Nature One, Time Warp, SonneMondSterne and Melt!.

Since the late 2000s, Berlin is still called the capital of techno and rave, and techno clubs such as Berghain, Tresor, KitKatClub or &quot;Watergate&quot; and the way to party in barely renovated venues, ruins or wooden shacks such as, among many others, Club der Visionaere, &quot;Wilde Renate&quot;, or Bar 25, attracted international media attention. One movie that portraits the scene of the 2000s is Berlin Calling starring Paul Kalkbrenner. In the 2010s, there continued to be a vivid rave and techno scene throughout the country, including numerous festivals and world-class techno clubs also outside of Berlin, such as for example MMA Club and Blitz Club in Munich, &quot;Institut für Zukunft&quot; in Leipzig or &quot;Robert Johnson&quot; in Offenbach.

===United Kingdom===

====Birth of UK rave scene (1980s–1990s)====

The UK was finally recognised for its rave culture in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By 1991, organisations such as Fantazia and Raindance were holding massive legal raves in fields and warehouses around the country. The Fantazia party at Castle Donington, July 1992 was an open-air, all-night event. The Vision at Pophams airfield in August 1992 and Universe&#x27;s Tribal Gathering in 1993 had a more festival feel.

By the middle of 1992, the scene was slowly changing, with local councils passing by-laws and increasing fees in an effort to prevent or discourage rave organisations from acquiring necessary licences. This meant that the days of the large one-off parties were numbered. By the mid-1990s, the scene had also fragmented into many different styles of dance music, making large parties more expensive to set up and more difficult to promote. The sound driving the big raves of the early 1990s had by the end of 1993 split into two distinct and polarising styles, the darker jungle and the faster happy hardcore. Although many ravers left the scene due to the split, promoters such as ESP Dreamscape and Helter Skelter still enjoyed widespread popularity and capacity attendances with multi-arena events catering to the various genres. Notable events of this period included ESP&#x27;s outdoor Dreamscape 20 event on 9 September 1995 at Brafield aerodrome fields, Northants and Helter Skelter&#x27;s Energy 97 outdoor event on 9 August 1997 at Turweston Aerodrome, Northants.

====Free parties and outlawing of raves (1992–1994)====

The illegal free party scene also reached its zenith for that time after a particularly large festival, when many individual sound systems such as Bedlam, Circus Warp, DIY, and Spiral Tribe set up near Castlemorton Common. The government acted. Under the &quot;Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994&quot;, the definition of music played at a rave was given as:

Sections 63, 64 and 65 of the Act targeted electronic dance music played at raves. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when a hundred or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave. Section 65 allows any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a five-mile radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale (£1000). The Act was officially introduced because of the noise and disruption caused by all night parties to nearby residents, and to protect the countryside. However, some participants in the scene claimed it was an attempt to lure youth culture away from MDMA and back to taxable alcohol. In November 1994, the Zippies staged an act of electronic civil disobedience to protest against the CJB (i.e., Criminal Justice Bill).

====Legal and underground raves (1994–present)====
After 1993, the main outlet for raves in the UK were a number of licensed parties, amongst them Helter Skelter, Life at Bowlers (Trafford Park, Manchester), The Edge (formerly the Eclipse [Coventry]), The Sanctuary (Milton Keynes) and Club Kinetic. In London, itself, there were a few large clubs that staged raves on a regular basis, most notably &quot;The Laser Dome&quot;, &quot;The Fridge&quot;, &quot;The Hippodrome&quot;, &quot;Club U.K.&quot;, and &quot;Trade.&quot; &quot;The Laser Dome&quot; featured two separate dance areas, &quot;Hardcore&quot; and &quot;Garage&quot;, as well as over 20 video game machines, a silent-movie screening lounge, replicas of the &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Bridge&quot;, and a large glass maze. In Scotland, event promoters Rezerection held large-scale events across the country.

By 1997, the popularity of weekly Superclub nights had taken over from the old Rave format, with a raft of new club-based genres sweeping in (e.g. Trance, Hard House, Speed and UK garage) alongside the more traditional House sound that had regained popularity. Clubs like Gatecrasher and Cream rose to prominence with dress codes and door policies that were the polar opposite of their rave counterparts; stories of refused entry due to not wearing the right clothing were commonplace, but seemingly did nothing to deter Superclub attendance.

====Illegal lockdown gatherings====
In August 2020, following a proliferation of illegal gatherings, the British government introduced additional legislation allowing police to issue organisers of illegal gatherings with fines of £10,000.

===United States===
====Origins in disco and psychedelia (1970s)====

The American electronic dance music scene is one of the earliest, and rave culture has its roots in the &quot;circuit parties&quot; and disco clubs of the late 1970s. These were scattered in cities large and small throughout the United States, from Buffalo to Cleveland to Aspen, Colorado. Cities like Chicago, Detroit, Miami, and New York City soon saw the rise of electronic music genres foundational to rave culture, such as house music, techno, and breakbeat. American ravers, like their UK and European counterparts, have been compared to the hippies of the 1960s due to their shared interest in non-violence and psychedelia. Rave culture incorporated disco culture&#x27;s same love of dance music spun by DJs, drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and hedonism. Although disco culture had thrived in the mainstream, the rave culture would make an effort to stay underground to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The key motive for remaining underground in many parts of the US had to do with curfew and the standard 2:00 am closing of clubs. It was a desire to keep the party going past legal hours that created the underground direction. Because of the legality, they had to be secretive about time and place.

==== Growth in Chicago (1980s) ====
Within the early 1980s Chicago created &quot;House music&quot; and quickly grew with the city. This music scene has been one of the earliest and most influential scenes in dance music history. Frankie Knuckles also known as &quot;Godfather of House Music&quot; who was a dj-producer that was considered to have invented &quot;Chicago House Music&quot;. He would mix a range of disco classics, indie-label soul tunes, European synth-disco that is now considered to be &quot;House Music&quot;. Frankie played his house beats at The Warehouse (1977–1982) that was a club for members only, that attracted many black gay men but his music gained a wider crowd which then attracted straighter, whiter crowds. Leading its owner of the club, Robert Williams, to get rid of memberships entirely. Frankie left to create his own club called, &quot;Power Plant&quot; (1983–1985) which gained the attention of an entirely diverse crowd. He created his House music by using his own edits and extending the grooves within the tunes to keep the dance floor filled all-night. Ultimately, this phenomenon spread exponentially throughout Chicago during 1986–1987. Chicago house influenced music which is what created &quot;House Music&quot; in England during 1986 this is what grew into Electronic Dance Music today.

====New York Raves and Party Promoters (1980s)====
In the late 1980s, rave culture began to filter through into North America from English expatriates and from US DJs who would visit Europe. However, rave culture&#x27;s major expansion in North America is often credited to Frankie Bones, who after spinning a party in an aircraft hangar in England, helped organise some of the earliest American raves in the 1990s in New York City called &quot;Storm Raves&quot;. Storm Raves had a consistent core audience, fostered by zines by fellow Storm DJ (and co-founder, with Adam X and Frankie Bones, of the US techno record store, Groove Records). Heather Heart held Under One Sky. Simultaneously in NYC, events were introducing electronic dance music to this city&#x27;s dance scene. Between 1992 and 1994, promotional groups sprung up across the east coast.

====Southern California and Latin America (1990s)====
In the 1990s, San Diego held large raves with audiences of thousands. These festivals were held on Indian reservations and ski resorts during the summer months and were headlined by DJs such as Doc Martin, Daniel Moontribe, Dimitri of Deee-lite, Afrika Islam and the Hardkiss brothers from San Francisco. They helped to create the Right to Dance movement—a non-violent protest held in San Diego and later in Los Angeles.

Featuring local San Diego DJs Jon Bishop, Steve Pagan, Alien Tom, Jeff Skot, Jon-e Thin, Paolo, Merlyn, Gmaxim, Tony Fiore, Damon and Mark E. Quark performed at these events. The events used large props and themes. The fairy and pixie craze, with ravers getting fairy tattoos and wearing fairy wings to parties was associated with the region. The percussive group Crash Worship was active here.

In 1993 out of the Los Angeles underground rave movement came Moontribe the original Southern California Full Moon Gathering and featured Dj&#x27;s Daniel Moontribe (aka Daniel Chavez aka Dcomplex aka Dcomplexity) and more.

====Growth in California====
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a boom in rave culture in the San Francisco Bay Area. At first, small underground parties sprung up all over the SOMA district in vacant warehouses, loft spaces, and clubs. The no alcohol rule fuelled the ecstasy-driven parties. Small underground raves were just starting out and expanding beyond SF to include the East Bay, the South Bay area including San Jose, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz beaches.

In late 1991, raves started to expand across northern California, and cities like Sacramento, Oakland, Silicon Valley (Palo Alto, San Jose). The massive parties were taking place in outdoor fields, aeroplane hangars and hilltops that surround the valley. San Francisco&#x27;s early promoters and DJs were from the UK and Europe. Raves took place in some of the SOMA art museum event such as, &#x27;Where the wild things are&#x27; in the museum on top of the Sony Metreon, and in the Maritime hall (1998–2002).

By the end of 1994, a new generation of ravers were attracted by the new sounds. EDM began to become popular. Raves could be found in many different kinds of venues, as opposed to just basements and warehouses. Promoters started to take notice and put together the massives of the late 1990s with many music forms under one roof for 12-hour events. Until 2003, the raves scene continued to grow slow and stay stable until there was increasingly awareness and publicity about illicit drug usage at raves, particularly ecstasy. Parallel to the rave scene growth, was an increase in anti drug policies, which were directly aimed and indirectly influenced rave organizational management and event. On 30 April 2003, the US Congress passed the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, which has origins from a similarly purposed, but not passed, 2002 bill. That bill is notably named The RAVE Act. Consequentially, by mid 2000s and late 2000s larger raves appeared more sporadically. Nevertheless, and parallel to new city ordinances regarding curfews and drug enforcement, rave event promoter companies like Go ventures and Insomniac persisted and continued annual scheduled rave events like Monster Massive, Together as One, and Electric Daisy Carnival. From this base of routine and consistency scheduled events, the rave scene reemerged with in 2010 with even more attendance and dance locations. The overwhelming attendance, including from lack of underage attendance restrictions, reached a changing point with the 185,000 estimated in attendance 2010 Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC). That 2010 event gained widespread attention because of the death and overdose of a 15-year-old girl, Sasha Rodriguez. The death prompted an investigation of EDC&#x27;s Insomniac&#x27;s founder Pasquale Rotella. That investigation resulted in him being charged with bribery of public employee Todd DeStefano. At the time, DeStefano was the LA Coliseum event manager, which was the location of 2010&#x27;s EDC. This in turn lead to a reorganisation of Insomniac rave events. For EDC in particular, while free on bail, Pasquale Rotella moved 2011&#x27;s EDC from Los Angeles to Las Vegas from then on as well as increased the EDC scheduled locations. Rotella later reached a plea bargain and avoided jail time.

====Seattle====
Through the mid-1990s and into the 2000s the city of Seattle also shared in the tradition of West Coast rave culture. Though a smaller scene compared to San Francisco, Seattle also had many different rave crews, promoters, DJs, and fans. Candy Raver style, friendship and culture became popular in the West Coast rave scene, both in Seattle and San Francisco. At the peak of West Coast rave, Candy Raver, and massive rave popularity (1996–1999,) it was common to meet groups of ravers, promoters, and DJs who frequently travelled between Seattle and San Francisco, as well as Bellingham, Vancouver, Canada and Portland, Oregon. This spread the overall sense of West Coast rave culture and the phenomenon of West Coast &quot;massives&quot;.

====Recent years (2000s)====

By 2010, raves were becoming the equivalent of large-scale rock music festivals, but many times even bigger and more profitable. The Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas drew more than 300,000 fans over three days in the summer of 2012, making it the largest EDM music festival in North America. Ultra Music Festival in Miami drew 150,000 fans over three days in 2012 while other raves like Electric Zoo in New York, Beyond Wonderland in LA, Movement in Detroit, Electric Forest in Michigan, Spring Awakening Music Festival in Chicago, and dozens more now attract hundreds of thousands of &quot;ravers&quot; every year. These new EDM-based rave events (now simply referred generically to as &quot;music festivals&quot;) sell out. Festival attendance at the Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) increased by 39.1%, or 90,000 attendees from 2011 to 2012. In 2013, EDC had attendance of approximately 345,000 people, a record for the festival. The average ticket for EDC cost over $300 and the event contributed $278 million to the Clark County economy in 2013. This festival takes place at a 1,000-acre complex featuring a half dozen custom built stages, enormous interactive art installations, and hundreds of EDM artists. Insomniac, a US EDM event promoter, holds yearly EDC and other EDM events.

===Australia===
====1980s and 1990s: outdoor raves and the Sydney scene====
Rave parties began in Australia as early as the 1980s and continued well into the late 1990s. They were mobilised versions of the &#x27;warehouse parties&#x27;, across Britain. Similar to the United States and Britain, raves in Australia were unlicensed and held in spaces normally used for industrial and manufacturing purposes, such as warehouses, factories and carpet showrooms. In addition, suburban locations were also used: basketball gymnasiums, train stations and even circus tents were all common venues. In Sydney, common areas used for outdoor events included Sydney Park, a reclaimed garbage dump in the inner south west of the city, Cataract Park and various other natural, unused locations and bush lands. The raves placed a heavy emphasis on the connection between humans and the natural environment, thus many raves in Sydney were held outdoors, notably the &#x27;Happy Valley&#x27; parties (1991–1994), &#x27;Ecology&#x27; (1992) and &#x27;Field of Dreams 4&#x27; (6 July 1996). The mid-late 1990s saw a slight decline in rave attendance, attributed to the death of Anna Wood at a licensed inner-city Sydney venue, which was hosting a rave party known as &quot;Apache&quot;. Wood had taken ecstasy and died in hospital a few days later, leading to extensive media exposure on the correlation of drug culture and its links to the rave scene in Australia.

====2000s–present====
The tradition continued in Melbourne, with &#x27;Earthcore&#x27; parties. Raves also became less underground as they were in the 1990s, and many were held at licensed venues well into the 2000s. Despite this, rave parties of 1990s size became less common. Nonetheless, the rave scene in Australia experienced a resurgence during the 2010s. During this period the resurfacing of the &quot;Melbourne Shuffle&quot;, a Melbourne club/rave dance style, became a YouTube trend and videos were uploaded. The rave subculture in Melbourne was strengthened with the opening of clubs such as Bass Station and Hard Candy and the rise of free party groups such as Melbourne Underground. In Melbourne, warehouse squat party and outdoor raves were frequently held throughout the 2010s, with attendance occasionally entering the thousands.

<text>A windmill is a structure that converts wind power into rotational energy using vanes called sails or blades, by tradition specifically to mill grain (gristmills), but in some parts of the English-speaking world, the term has also been extended to encompass windpumps, wind turbines, and other applications. The term wind engine is also sometimes used to describe such devices.

Windmills were used throughout the high medieval and early modern periods; the horizontal or panemone windmill first appeared in Persia during the 9th century, and the vertical windmill first appeared in northwestern Europe in the 12th century. Regarded as an icon of Dutch culture, there are approximately 1,000 windmills in the Netherlands today.

== Forerunners ==

Wind-powered machines may have been known earlier, but there is no clear evidence of windmills before the 9th century. Hero of Alexandria (Heron) in first-century Roman Egypt described what appears to be a wind-driven wheel to power a machine. His description of a wind-powered organ is not a practical windmill but was either an early wind-powered toy or a design concept for a wind-powered machine that may or may not have been a working device, as there is ambiguity in the text and issues with the design. Another early example of a wind-driven wheel was the prayer wheel, which is believed to have been first used in Tibet and China, though there is uncertainty over the date of its first appearance, which could have been either , the 7th century, or after the 9th century.

One of the earliest recorded working windmill designs found was invented sometime around 700–900 AD in Persia. This design was the panemone, with vertical lightweight wooden sails attached by horizontal struts to a central vertical shaft. It was first built to pump water and subsequently modified to grind grain as well.

== Horizontal windmills ==


The first practical windmills were panemone windmills, using sails that rotated in a horizontal plane, around a vertical axis. Made of six to 12 sails covered in reed matting or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water. A medieval account reports that windmill technology was used in Persia and the Middle East during the reign of Rashidun caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (), based on the caliph&#x27;s conversation with a Persian builder slave. The authenticity of part of the anecdote involving the caliph Umar is questioned because it was recorded only in the 10th century. The Persian geographer Estakhri reported windmills being operated in Khorasan (Eastern Iran and Western Afghanistan) already in the 9th century.
Such windmills were in widespread use across the Middle East and Central Asia and later spread to Europe, China, and India from there. By the 11th century, the vertical-axle windmill had reached parts of Southern Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula (via Al-Andalus) and the Aegean Sea (in the Balkans). A similar type of horizontal windmill with rectangular blades, used for irrigation, can also be found in thirteenth-century China (during the Jurchen Jin dynasty in the north), introduced by the travels of Yelü Chucai to Turkestan in 1219.

Vertical-axle windmills were built, in small numbers, in Europe during the 18th and nineteenth centuries, for example Fowler&#x27;s Mill at Battersea in London, and Hooper&#x27;s Mill at Margate in Kent. These early modern examples seem not to have been directly influenced by the vertical-axle windmills of the medieval period, but to have been independent inventions by 18th-century engineers.

== Vertical windmills ==

The horizontal-axis or vertical windmill (so called due to the plane of the movement of its sails) is a development of the 12th century, first used in northwestern Europe, in the triangle of northern France, eastern England and Flanders.
It is unclear whether the vertical windmill was influenced by the introduction of the horizontal windmill from Persia-Middle East to Southern Europe in the preceding century.

The earliest certain reference to a windmill in Northern Europe (assumed to have been of the vertical type) dates from 1185, in the former village of Weedley in Yorkshire which was located at the southern tip of the Wold overlooking the Humber Estuary. Several earlier, but less certainly dated, 12th-century European sources referring to windmills have also been found.
These earliest mills were used to grind cereals.

=== Post mill ===
The evidence at present is that the earliest type of European windmill was the post mill, so named because of the large upright post on which the mill&#x27;s main structure (the &quot;body&quot; or &quot;buck&quot;) is balanced. By mounting the body this way, the mill can rotate to face the wind direction; an essential requirement for windmills to operate economically in north-western Europe, where wind directions are variable. The body contains all the milling machinery. The first post mills were of the sunken type, where the post was buried in an earth mound to support it. Later, a wooden support was developed called the trestle. This was often covered over or surrounded by a roundhouse to protect the trestle from the weather and to provide storage space. This type of windmill was the most common in Europe until the 19th century when more powerful tower and smock mills replaced them.

==== Hollow-post mill ====

In a hollow-post mill, the post on which the body is mounted is hollowed out, to accommodate the drive shaft.
This makes it possible to drive machinery below or outside the body while still being able to rotate the body into the wind. Hollow-post mills driving scoop wheels were used in the Netherlands to drain wetlands since the early 15th century onwards.

=== Tower mill ===


By the end of the 13th century, the masonry tower mill, on which only the cap is rotated rather than the whole body of the mill, had been introduced. The spread of tower mills came with a growing economy that called for larger and more stable sources of power, though they were more expensive to build. In contrast to the post mill, only the cap of the tower mill needs to be turned into the wind, so the main structure can be made much taller, allowing the sails to be made longer, which enables them to provide useful work even in low winds. The cap can be turned into the wind either by winches or gearing inside the cap or from a winch on the tail pole outside the mill. A method of keeping the cap and sails into the wind automatically is by using a fantail, a small windmill mounted at right angles to the sails, at the rear of the windmill. These are also fitted to tail poles of post mills and are common in Great Britain and English-speaking countries of the former British Empire, Denmark, and Germany but rare in other places. Around some parts of the Mediterranean Sea, tower mills with fixed caps were built because the wind&#x27;s direction varied little most of the time.

=== Smock mill ===


The smock mill is a later development of the tower mill, where the masonry tower is replaced by a wooden framework, called the &quot;smock&quot;, which is thatched, boarded, or covered by other materials, such as slate, sheet metal, or tar paper. The smock is commonly of octagonal plan, though there are examples with different numbers of sides.

Smock windmills were introduced by the Dutch in the 17th century to overcome the limitations of tower windmills, which were expensive to build and could not be erected on wet surfaces. The lower half of the smock windmill was made of brick, while the upper half was made of wood, with a sloping tower shape that added structural strength to the design. This made them lightweight and able to be erected on unstable ground.

The smock windmill design included a small turbine in the back that helped the main mill to face the direction of the wind.

== Mechanics ==

=== Sails ===


Common sails consist of a lattice framework on which the sailcloth is spread. The miller can adjust the amount of cloth spread according to the wind and the power needed. In medieval mills, the sailcloth was wound in and out of a ladder-type arrangement of sails. Later mill sails had a lattice framework over which the sailcloth was spread, while in colder climates, the cloth was replaced by wooden slats, which were easier to handle in freezing conditions. The jib sail is commonly found in Mediterranean countries and consists of a simple triangle of cloth wound round a spar.

In all cases, the mill needs to be stopped to adjust the sails. Inventions in Great Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries led to sails that automatically adjust to the wind speed without the need for the miller to intervene, culminating in patent sails invented by William Cubitt in 1807. In these sails, the cloth is replaced by a mechanism of connected shutters.

In France, Pierre-Théophile Berton invented a system consisting of longitudinal wooden slats connected by a mechanism that lets the miller open them while the mill is turning. In the twentieth century, increased knowledge of aerodynamics from the development of the airplane led to further improvements in efficiency by German engineer Bilau and several Dutch millwrights.
The majority of windmills have four sails. Multiple-sailed mills, with five, six, or eight sails, were built in Great Britain (especially in and around the counties of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire), Germany, and less commonly elsewhere. Earlier multiple-sailed mills are found in Spain, Portugal, Greece, parts of Romania, Bulgaria, and Russia. A mill with an even number of sails has the advantage of being able to run with a damaged sail by removing both the damaged sail and the one opposite, which does not unbalance the mill.

In the Netherlands, the stationary position of the sails, i.e. when the mill is not working, has long been used to give signals. If the blades are stopped in a &quot;+&quot; sign (3-6-9-12 o&#x27;clock), the windmill is open for business. When the blades are stopped in an &quot;X&quot; configuration, the windmill is closed or not functional. A slight tilt of the sails (top blade at 1 o&#x27;clock) signals joy, such as the birth of a healthy baby. A tilt of the blades to 11-2-5-8 o&#x27;clock signals mourning, or warning. It was used to signal the local region during Nazi operations in World War II, such as searches for Jews. Across the Netherlands, windmills were placed in mourning positions in honor of the Dutch victims of the 2014 Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 shootdown.

=== Machinery ===
Gears inside a windmill convey power from the rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, wood with a cast iron pole end (where the sails are mounted), or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between the front and rear bearings. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth in the side of the rim which drives the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.
The machinery differs if the windmill is used for other applications than milling grain. A drainage mill uses another set of gear wheels on the bottom end of the upright shaft to drive a scoop wheel or Archimedes&#x27; screw. Sawmills uses a crankshaft to provide a reciprocating motion to the saws. Windmills have been used to power many other industrial processes, including papermills, threshing mills, and to process oil seeds, wool, paints, and stone products.

== Spread and decline ==



In the 14th century, windmills became popular in Europe; the total number of wind-powered mills is estimated to have been around 200,000 at the peak in 1850, which is close to half of the some 500,000 water wheels. Windmills were applied in regions where there was too little water, where rivers freeze in winter and in flat lands where the flow of the river was too slow to provide the required power. With the coming of the Industrial Revolution, the importance of wind and water as primary industrial energy sources declined, and they were eventually replaced by steam (in steam mills) and internal combustion engines, although windmills continued to be built in large numbers until late in the nineteenth century. More recently, windmills have been preserved for their historic value, in some cases as static exhibits when the antique machinery is too fragile to be put in motion, and other cases as fully working mills.

Of the 10,000 windmills in use in the Netherlands around 1850, about 1,000 are still standing. Most of these are being run by volunteers, though some grist mills are still operating commercially. Many of the drainage mills have been appointed as a backup to the modern pumping stations. The Zaan district has been said to have been the first industrialized region of the world with around 600 operating wind-powered industries by the end of the eighteenth century. Economic fluctuations and the industrial revolution had a much greater impact on these industries than on grain and drainage mills, so only very few are left.

Construction of mills spread to the Cape Colony in the seventeenth century. The early tower mills did not survive the gales of the Cape Peninsula, so in 1717 the Heeren XVII sent carpenters, masons, and materials to construct a durable mill. The mill, completed in 1718, became known as the &quot;Oude Molen&quot; and was located between Pinelands Station and the Black River. Long since demolished, its name lives on as that of a Technical school in Pinelands. By 1863, Cape Town had 11 mills stretching from Paarden Eiland to Mowbray.

== Specialized windmills ==

=== Wind turbines ===


A wind turbine is a windmill-like structure specifically developed to generate electricity. They can be seen as the next step in the development of the windmill. The first wind turbines were built by the end of the nineteenth century by James Blyth in Scotland (1887), Charles F. Brush in Cleveland, Ohio (1887–1888) and Poul la Cour in Denmark (1890s). La Cour&#x27;s mill from 1896 later became the local power of the village of Askov. By 1908, there were 72 wind-driven electric generators in Denmark, ranging from 5 to 25 kW. By the 1930s, windmills were widely used to generate electricity on farms in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed, built by companies such as Jacobs Wind, Wincharger, Miller Airlite, Universal Aeroelectric, Paris-Dunn, Airline, and Winpower. The Dunlite Corporation produced turbines for similar locations in Australia.

Forerunners of modern horizontal-axis utility-scale wind generators were the WIME-3D in service in Balaklava, USSR, from 1931 until 1942, a 100 kW generator on a tower, the Smith–Putnam wind turbine built in 1941 on the mountain known as Grandpa&#x27;s Knob in Castleton, Vermont, United States, of 1.25 MW, and the NASA wind turbines developed from 1974 through the mid-1980s. The development of these 13 experimental wind turbines pioneered many of the wind turbine design technologies in use today, including steel tube towers, variable-speed generators, composite blade materials, and partial-span pitch control, as well as aerodynamic, structural, and acoustic engineering design capabilities. The modern wind power industry began in 1979 with the serial production of wind turbines by Danish manufacturers Kuriant, Vestas, Nordtank, and Bonus. These early turbines were small by today&#x27;s standards, with capacities of 20–30 kW each. Since then, commercial turbines have increased greatly in size, with the Enercon E-126 capable of delivering up to 7 MW, while wind turbine production has expanded to many countries.

As the 21st century began, rising concerns over energy security, global warming, and eventual fossil fuel depletion led to an expansion of interest in all available forms of renewable energy. Worldwide, many thousands of wind turbines are now operating, with a total nameplate capacity of 591 GW as of 2018.

==== Materials ====
In an attempt to make wind turbines more efficient and increase their energy output, they are being built bigger, with taller towers and longer blades, and being increasingly deployed in offshore locations. While such changes increase their power output, they subject the components of the windmills to stronger forces and consequently put them at a greater risk of failure. Taller towers and longer blades suffer from higher fatigue, and offshore windfarms are subject to greater forces due to higher wind speeds and accelerated corrosion due to the proximity to seawater.
To ensure a long enough lifetime to make the return on the investment viable, the materials for the components must be chosen appropriately.

The blade of a wind turbine consists of 4 main elements: the root, spar, aerodynamic fairing, and surfacing. The fairing is composed of two shells (one on the pressure side, and one on the suction side), connected by one or more webs linking the upper and lower shells. The webs connect to the spar laminates, which are enclosed within the skins (surfacing) of the blade, and together, the system of the webs and spars resist the flapwise loading. Flapwise loading, one of the two different types of loading that blades are subject to, is caused by the wind pressure, and edgewise loading (the second type of loading) is caused by the gravitational force and torque load. The former loading subjects the spar laminate on the pressure (upwind) side of the blade to cyclic tension-tension loading, while the suction (downwind) side of the blade is subject to cyclic compression-compression loading. Edgewise bending subjects the leading edge to a tensile load, and the trailing edge to a compressive load. The remainder of the shell, not supported by the spars or laminated at the leading and trailing edges, is designed as a sandwiched structure, consisting of multiple layers to prevent elastic buckling.

In addition to meeting the stiffness, strength, and toughness requirements determined by the loading, the blade needs to be lightweight, and the weight of the blade scales with the cube of its radius. To determine which materials fit the criteria described above, a parameter known as the beam merit index is defined: Mb = E^1/2 / rho, where E is Young&#x27;s modulus and rho is the density. The best blade materials are carbon fiber and glass fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP and GFRP). Currently, GFRP materials are chosen for their lower cost, despite the much greater figure of merit of CFRP.

==== Recycling and waste problems with polymers blades ====
When the Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm was taken down in Denmark in 2017, 99% of the not-degradable fiberglass from 33 wind turbine blades ended as cut up at the Rærup Controlled Landfill near Aalborg and in 2020, with considerably larger fiberglass quantities, even though it is the least environmentally friendly way of handling waste. Scrapped wind turbine blades are set to become a huge waste problem in Denmark and countries Denmark, to a greater and greater extent, export its many produced wind turbines.

&quot;The reason why many wings end up in landfill is that they are incredibly difficult to separate from each other, which you will have to do if you hope to be able to recycle the fiberglass&quot;, says Lykke Margot Ricard, Associate Professor in Innovation and Technological Foresight and education leader for civil engineering in Product Development and Innovation at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). According to Dakofa, the Danish Competence Center for Waste and Resources, there is nothing specific in the Danish waste order about how to handle discarded fiberglass.

Several scrap dealers tell Ingeniøren that they have handled wind turbine blades (wings) that have been pulverized after being taken to a recycling station. One of them is the recycling company H.J. Hansen, where the product manager informed, that they have transported approximately half of the wings they have received since 2012 to Reno Nord&#x27;s landfill in Aalborg. A total of around 1,000 wings have ended up there, he estimates - and today up to 99 percent of the wings the company receives end up in a landfill.

Since 1996, according to an estimate made by Lykke Margot Ricard (SDU) in 2020, at least 8,810 tonnes of the wing scrap have been disposed of in Denmark, and the waste problem will grow significantly in the coming years when more and more wind turbines have reached their end of life. According to the SDU lecturer&#x27;s calculations, the waste sector in Denmark will have to receive 46,400 tonnes of fiberglass from wind turbine blades over the next 20–25 years.

As so, at the island, Lolland, in Denmark, 250 tonnes of fiberglass from wind turbine waste also pours up on a landfill at Gerringe in the middle of Lolland in 2020.

In the United States, worn-out wind turbine blades made of fiberglass go to the handful of landfills that accept them (e.g., in Lake Mills, Iowa; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Casper).

=== Windpumps ===


Windpumps were used to pump water since at least the 9th century in what is now Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan. The use of windpumps became widespread across the Muslim world and later spread to East Asia (China) and South Asia (India). Windmills were later used extensively in Europe, particularly in the Netherlands and the East Anglia area of Great Britain, from the late Middle Ages onwards, to drain land for agricultural or building purposes.

The &quot;American windmill&quot;, or &quot;wind engine&quot;, was invented by Daniel Halladay in 1854 and was used mostly for lifting water from wells. Larger versions were also used for tasks such as sawing wood, chopping hay, and shelling and grinding grain. In early California and some other states, the windmill was part of a self-contained domestic water system which included a hand-dug well and a wooden water tower supporting a redwood tank enclosed by wooden siding known as a tankhouse. During the late 19th century, steel blades and towers replaced wooden construction. At their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use. Firms such as U.S. Wind Engine and Pump Company, Challenge Wind Mill and Feed Mill Company, Appleton Manufacturing Company, Star, Eclipse, Fairbanks-Morse, Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company, and Aermotor became the main suppliers in North and South America. These windpumps are used extensively on farms and ranches in the United States, Canada, Southern Africa, and Australia. They feature a large number of blades, so they turn slowly with considerable torque in low winds and are self-regulating in high winds. A tower-top gearbox and crankshaft convert the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Such mills pumped water and powered feed mills, sawmills, and agricultural machinery.

In Australia, the Griffiths Brothers at Toowoomba manufactured windmills of the American pattern from 1876, with the trade name Southern Cross Windmills in use from 1903. These became an icon of the Australian rural sector by utilizing the water of the Great Artesian Basin. Another well-known maker was Metters Ltd. of Adelaide, Perth and Sydney.

<text>A heuristic argument is an argument that reasons from the value of a method or principle that has been shown experimentally (especially through trial-and-error) to be useful or convincing in learning, discovery and problem-solving, but whose line of reasoning involves key oversimplifications that make it not entirely rigorous. A widely used and important example of a heuristic argument is Occam&#x27;s Razor.

It is a speculative, non-rigorous argument that relies on analogy or intuition, and that allows one to achieve a result or an approximation that is to be checked later with more rigor. Otherwise, the results are generally to be doubted. It is used as a hypothesis or a conjecture in an investigation, though it can also be used as a mnemonic as well.

<text>Ian Robins Dury (12 May 1942 27 March 2000) was an English singer, songwriter and actor who rose to fame in the late 1970s, during the punk and new wave era of rock music. He was the lead singer and lyricist of Kilburn and the High Roads, the Kilburns, Ian Dury and the Blockheads and Ian Dury and the Music Students.

==Early life and education==
Ian Dury was born at 43 Weald Rise in Harrow, then in Middlesex. His early years were spent in Harrow Weald (although it&#x27;s often misreported that he was born in Upminster, Essex, an impression he often encouraged) and in Mevagissey, Cornwall, during the Blitz. His father, William George Dury (born 23 September 1905 in Southborough, Kent, died 25 February 1968 in Victoria, London), was a former boxer, coach and bus driver, and chauffeur for Rolls-Royce. His mother, Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Cuthbertson Walker (born 17 April 1910, Rochdale, Lancashire, died 20 December 1994 in Hampstead, London), was a health visitor, a doctor&#x27;s daughter and the granddaughter of an East Donegal Ulster Protestant landowner. Bill and Peggy married in 1939 and set up home in Belsize Park, London.

Bill Dury was absent for work for long periods, so Peggy often took Ian to stay with her parents in Mevagissey. After the Second World War, the family moved briefly to Switzerland, where Ian&#x27;s father was chauffeuring for a millionaire and the Western European Union. In 1946, Peggy brought Ian back to England and they relocated to Cranham, near Upminster in Essex, to live with Peggy&#x27;s sisters. Although he saw his father on visits, they were never to live together again.
At age seven, Dury contracted polio, most likely, he believed, at Westcliff Swimming Pool in Southend-on-Sea during the 1949 polio epidemic. After six weeks of isolation in the Royal Cornwall Infirmary, Truro, Ian was moved by ambulance back to Essex, to Black Notley Hospital in Braintree, where he spent eighteen months regaining his strength and mobility. Polio caused paralysis on the left-hand side of his body which led to a permanent disability.

Ian attended Chailey Heritage Craft School, East Sussex, from 1951 till 1954. Chailey was a hospital school for disabled children that had an ethos of toughening up its students, often by leaving the less physically able to find their own way up off the floor. Arguably, this harsh approach contributed to the tough and determined person Dury became. Chailey taught trades such as cobbling and printing, but Dury&#x27;s mother wanted him to focus on academic studies, so Aunt Moll (Mary Walker), a Buckinghamshire Education Officer, arranged for him to attend the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe. Ian found this school a challenge and recounted being punished for misdemeanours by being forced by prefects to learn long tracts of poetry until a housemaster found him sobbing and put a stop to it:
 He left school at 16, having achieved GCE &#x27;O&#x27; levels in English Language, English Literature and Art to study art and design at Walthamstow College of Art, where he met lifelong friend, pop artist and teacher Peter Blake. In 1963 Ian began an MA in painting at the Royal College of Art, graduating in 1966.

==Art career==

In 1967 Dury took part in a group exhibition, &quot;Fantasy and Figuration&quot;, alongside Elizabeth Rathmell, Pat Douthwaite, Herbert Kitchen and Stass Paraskos at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.

Between 1966 and 1973 he was an art teacher at Luton College of Technology and at Canterbury College of Art. He also painted commercial illustrations for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in the early 1970s.

==Music career==
===Kilburn and the High Roads (1971–1975)===
Dury formed Kilburn and the High Roads (a reference to the road in North West London) in 1971, and they played their first gig at Croydon School of Art on 5 December 1971. Dury was vocalist and lyricist, co-writing with pianist Russell Hardy and later enrolling into the group a number of the students he was teaching at Canterbury College of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts), including guitarist Keith Lucas (who later became the guitarist for 999 under the name Nick Cash) and bassist Humphrey Ocean.

Managed first by Charlie Gillett and Gordon Nelki and latterly by fashion entrepreneur Tommy Roberts, the Kilburns were popular on London&#x27;s pub rock circuit and signed to Dawn Records in 1974 but, despite favourable press coverage and a tour opening for English rock band The Who, the group failed to rise above cult status and disbanded in 1975.

Kilburn and the High Roads recorded two albums, &quot;Handsome&quot; and &quot;Wotabunch!&quot;.

===Going solo (August – September 1977)===

The single &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, released 26 August 1977, marked Dury&#x27;s Stiff Records debut. Although it was banned by the BBC, it was named Single of the Week by &quot;NME&quot; on its release. The single issue was soon followed, at the end of September, by the album &quot;New Boots and Panties!!&quot; which achieved platinum status. &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot; was not listed on the album&#x27;s track list, yet it was nonetheless present as track 1 on side 2 of some later 1977 pressings).

===The Blockheads (October 1977 – present)===
Under the management of Andrew King and Peter Jenner, the original managers of Pink Floyd, Ian Dury and the Blockheads quickly gained a reputation as one of the top live acts of new wave music.

The Blockheads&#x27; sound drew from its members&#x27; diverse musical influences, which included jazz, rock and roll, funk, and reggae, and Dury&#x27;s love of music hall. The band was formed after Dury began writing songs with pianist and guitarist Chaz Jankel (the brother of music video, TV, commercial and film director Annabel Jankel). Jankel took Dury&#x27;s lyrics, fashioned a number of songs, and they began recording with members of Radio Caroline&#x27;s Loving Awareness Band drummer Charley Charles (born Hugh Glenn Mortimer Charles, Guyana 1945), bassist Norman Watt-Roy, keyboard player Mick Gallagher, guitarist John Turnbull and former Kilburns saxophonist Davey Payne.

In October 1977 Dury and his band started performing as Ian Dury and the Blockheads, when the band signed on for the Stiff &quot;Live Stiffs Tour&quot; alongside Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions, Nick Lowe, Wreckless Eric, and Larry Wallis. The tour was a success, and Stiff launched a concerted Ian Dury marketing campaign, resulting in the Top Ten hit &quot;What a Waste&quot; and the hit single &quot;Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick&quot;, which reached No. 1 in the UK at the beginning of 1979, selling just short of a million copies. Again, &quot;Hit Me&quot; was not included on the original release of the subsequent album &quot;Do It Yourself&quot;. With their hit singles, the band built up a dedicated following in the UK and other countries and their next single &quot;Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3&quot; made number three in the UK.
The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; was released in June 1979 in a Barney Bubbles-designed sleeve of which there were over a dozen variations, all based on samples from the Crown wallpaper catalogue. Bubbles also designed the Blockhead logo.

Jankel left the band temporarily and relocated to the US after the release of &quot;What a Waste&quot; (his organ part on that single was overdubbed later) but he subsequently returned to the UK and began touring sporadically with the Blockheads, eventually returning to the group full-time for the recording of &quot;Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick&quot;; according to Mickey Gallagher, the band recorded 28 takes of the song but eventually settled on the second take for the single release. Partly due to personality clashes with Dury, Jankel left the group again in 1980, after the recording of the &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; LP, and he returned to the US to concentrate on his solo career.

The group worked solidly over the 18 months between the release of &quot;Rhythm Stick&quot; and their next single, &quot;Reasons to Be Cheerful, Part 3&quot;, which returned them to the charts, making the UK Top 10. Jankel was replaced by former Dr. Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson, who also contributed to the next album &quot;Laughter&quot; (1980) and its two hit singles, although Gallagher recalls that the recording of the &quot;Laughter&quot; album was difficult and that Dury was drinking heavily in this period.

In 1980–81 Dury and Jankel teamed up again with Sly and Robbie and the Compass Point All Stars to record &quot;Lord Upminster&quot; (1981). The Blockheads toured the UK and Europe throughout 1981, sometimes augmented by jazz trumpeter Don Cherry, ending the year with their only tour of Australia.
The Blockheads disbanded in early 1982, after Dury secured a new recording deal with Polydor Records through A&amp;R man Frank Neilson. Choosing to work with a group of young musicians which he named the Music Students, he recorded the album &quot;Four Thousand Weeks&#x27; Holiday&quot;. This album marked a departure from his usual style and was not as well received by fans for its American jazz influence.

The Blockheads briefly reformed in June 1987 to play a short tour of Japan, and then disbanded again. In September 1990, following the death from cancer of drummer Charley Charles, they reunited for two benefit concerts in aid of Charles&#x27; family, held at The Forum, Camden Town, with Steven Monti on drums. In December 1990, augmented by Merlin Rhys-Jones on guitar and Will Parnell on percussion, they recorded the live album &quot;Warts &amp; Audience&quot; at the Brixton Academy.

The Blockheads (minus Jankel, who returned to California) toured Spain in January 1991, then disbanded again until August 1992 when, following Jankel&#x27;s return to England, they were invited to reform for the Madstock! Festival in Finsbury Park; this was followed by sporadic gigs in Europe, Ireland, the UK and Japan in late 1994 and 1995. In the early 1990s, Dury appeared with English band Curve on the benefit compilation album &quot;Peace Together&quot;. Dury and Curve singer Toni Halliday shared vocals on a cover of the Blockheads&#x27; track &quot;What a Waste&quot;.

In March 1996 Dury was diagnosed with cancer and, after recovering from an operation, he set about writing another album. In late 1996 he reunited with the Blockheads to record the album &quot;Mr. Love Pants&quot; (1997). Ian Dury and the Blockheads resumed touring, with Dylan Howe replacing Steven Monti on drums. Davey Payne left the group permanently in August and was replaced by Gilad Atzmon; this line-up gigged throughout 1999, culminating in their last performance with Ian Dury on 6 February 2000 at the London Palladium. Dury died six weeks later on 27 March 2000.

The Blockheads have continued after Dury&#x27;s death, and continue to play live gigs .

===Other solo work===

Dury continued to record other work without the Blockheads, including &quot;Lord Upminster&quot; (1981); &quot;Apples&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Bus Driver&#x27;s Prayer &amp; Other Stories&quot; (1992). He also released a single album with the Music Students, &quot;4,000 Weeks&#x27; Holiday&quot; (1984).
His 1981 song &quot;Spasticus Autisticus&quot; written to show his disdain for that year&#x27;s International Year of Disabled Persons, which he saw as patronising and counter-productive was banned by the BBC from being broadcast by the BBC before 6 pm. The lyrics were uncompromising:

&lt;poem&gt;
 So place your hard-earned peanuts in my tin
 And thank the Creator you&#x27;re not in the state I&#x27;m in
 So long have I been languished on the shelf
 I must give all proceedings to myself&lt;/poem&gt;
The song&#x27;s refrain, &quot;I&#x27;m spasticus, autisticus&quot;, was inspired by the response of the rebellious Roman gladiators in the film &quot;Spartacus&quot;, who, when instructed to identify their leader, all answered, &quot;I am Spartacus&quot;, to protect him. According to George McKay, in his 2009 article &quot;Crippled with nerves&quot; (an early Dury song title), for &quot;Popular Music&quot;:
Dury described the song as &quot;a war cry&quot; on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. The song was used at the opening of the London 2012 Paralympics.
In 1984, Dury was featured in the music video for the minor hit single &quot;Walking in My Sleep&quot; by Roger Daltrey of The Who.
==Musical influences and style==

Dury&#x27;s self-styling and chief musical influence was his hero since childhood, American rock and roll and rockabilly artist Gene Vincent. After hearing Vincent&#x27;s hit single &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot; in the 1956 musical comedy film &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;, he idolised him. Vincent also wore a leg brace, although Dury said he did not know this until later. Vincent is mentioned in one of Dury&#x27;s earliest songs, &quot;Upminster Kid&quot; (on the 1975 Kilburn and the High Roads album &quot;Handsome&quot;), with the words &quot;Well Gene Vincent Craddock remembered the love of an Upminster rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll teen&quot;. Vincent had died four years earlier.

More well-known is the single &quot;Sweet Gene Vincent&quot; from his first solo album, &quot;New Boots and Panties!!&quot; in 1977. He wrote the lyrics after spending six weeks of research on Vincent, which included reading two biographies. His songwriting partner Chas Jankel had to trim it considerably, after Dury&#x27;s original version, Jankel joked, &quot;would have taken around 15 minutes to perform&quot;. The opening lyrics to the song were:

Dury was a lover of music hall, another of his heroes being Max Wall. Dury developed a unique style that mixed music hall with punk and rock and roll, and crafted an on-stage persona that entertained his audiences.

Dury&#x27;s lyrics are a combination of lyrical poetry, word play, observation of British everyday life, character sketches, and sexual humour: &quot;This is what we find ... Home improvement expert Harold Hill of Harold Hill, Of do-it-yourself dexterity and double-glazing skill, Came home to find another gentleman&#x27;s kippers in the grill, So he sanded off his winkle with his Black &amp; Decker drill&quot;. The song &quot;Billericay Dickie&quot; rhymes &quot;I had a love affair with Nina, In the back of my Cortina&quot; with &quot;A seasoned-up hyena Could not have been more obscener&quot;.

==Acting and other activities==

Dury&#x27;s confident and unusual demeanour caught the eyes of producers and directors of drama. His first important and extensive role was in Farrukh Dhondy&#x27;s mini-series for the BBC &quot;King of the Ghetto&quot; (1986), a drama set in London&#x27;s multi-racial Brick Lane area with a cast led by a young Tim Roth.

Dury had small parts in several films, probably the best known of which was Peter Greenaway&#x27;s &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover&quot; (1989), as well as a cameo appearance in Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Pirates&quot; (1986). He also appeared in the Eduardo Guedes film &quot; Rocinante&quot; (1986), the German comedy (lead) &quot;Brennende Betten&quot; (Burning Beds) (1988), Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rainbow Thief&quot; (1990), and the Sylvester Stallone science fiction film &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; (1995). His other film appearances included roles in &quot;Number One&quot; (1985) starring Bob Geldof, the Bob Hoskins film &quot;The Raggedy Rawney&quot; (1988), and &quot;Split Second&quot; (1992) starring Rutger Hauer and Kim Cattrall. He also appeared alongside fellow lyricists Bob Dylan and Tom Waits, respectively, in the movies &quot;Hearts of Fire&quot; (1987) and &quot;Bearskin: An Urban Fairytale&quot; (1990), also by Eduardo Guedes. His later films included the comedy &quot;Different for Girls&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot; (1996), directed by Tim Pope, who had directed a few of Dury&#x27;s music videos.

Dury also wrote a musical, &quot;Apples&quot;, staged in London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre. In 1987 he appeared as the narrator (Scullery) in &quot;Road&quot;, also at the Royal Court. Among the cast was actress and singer Jane Horrocks, who cohabited with Dury until late in 1988, although the relationship was kept discreet.

Dury wrote and performed the theme song &quot;Profoundly in Love with Pandora&quot; for the television series &quot;The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾&quot; (1985), based on the book of the same name by Sue Townsend, as well as its follow-up, &quot;The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole&quot; (1987). Dury turned down an offer from Andrew Lloyd Webber to write the libretto for &quot;Cats&quot; (from which Richard Stilgoe reportedly earned millions). The reason, said Dury, &quot;I can&#x27;t stand his music.&quot;
When HIV/AIDS first came to prominence in the mid-1980s, Dury was among celebrities who appeared on UK television to promote safe sex, demonstrating how to put on a condom using a model of an erect penis. In the 1990s, he became an ambassador for UNICEF, recruiting stars such as Robbie Williams to publicise the cause. The two visited Sri Lanka in this capacity to promote polio vaccination. Dury appeared with Curve on the &quot;Peace Together&quot; concert and CD (1993), performing &quot;What a Waste&quot;, with benefits to the Youth of Northern Ireland. He also supported the charity Cancer BACUP.

Dury appeared in the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; episode that focused on Steely Dan&#x27;s album &quot;Aja&quot;. Dury commented that the album was one of the most &quot;upful&quot; he had ever heard, and that the album &quot;lifted [his] spirits up&quot; whenever he played it.

Dury also appeared at the end of the Carter USM track &quot;Skywest &amp; Crooked&quot; narrating from the musical &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;.

==Illness and death==
Dury was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 1996 and underwent surgery, but tumours were later found in his liver, and he was told that his condition was terminal.

In 1998, his death was incorrectly announced on XFM radio by Bob Geldof, possibly due to hoax information from a listener. In 1999, Dury collaborated with Madness on their first original album in fourteen years on the track &quot;Drip Fed Fred&quot;. It was one of his last recordings, though he also performed again with the Blockheads in mid-1999 at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s in Soho. This was a special performance recorded for LWT&#x27;s &quot;South Bank Show&quot; and the audience were invited fans and friends of the band and crew. His deteriorating condition was evident and he had to take rests between takes and be helped on and off stage.

Ian Dury and the Blockheads&#x27; last public performance was a charity concert in aid of Cancer BACUP on 6 February 2000 at the London Palladium, supported by Kirsty MacColl and Phill Jupitus. Dury was noticeably ill and again had to be helped on and off stage.

Dury died of metastatic colorectal cancer on 27 March 2000, aged 57, in Hampstead, London. He was cremated after a humanist funeral at Golders Green Crematorium with 250 mourners at the service, including fellow musicians Suggs and Jools Holland and other &quot;celebrity fans&quot; such as Member of Parliament (MP) Mo Mowlam.
An obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; called him &quot;one of few true originals of the English music scene&quot;. Suggs, the lead singer of Madness, called him &quot;possibly the finest lyricist we&#x27;ve seen&quot;. The Ian Dury website opened an online book of condolence shortly after his death, which was signed by hundreds of fans.

==Legacy==

Dury&#x27;s son, Baxter Dury, is also a singer. He sang a few of his father&#x27;s songs at the wake after the funeral, and has released six of his own albums, including &quot;It&#x27;s a Pleasure&quot; (2014), &quot;Prince of Tears&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Night Chancers&quot; (2020).

In 2002, Jemima Dury organised a &quot;musical bench&quot; designed by Mil Stricevic to be placed in a favourite viewing spot of Dury&#x27;s near Poets&#x27; Corner, in the gardens of Pembroke Lodge, in Richmond Park, south-west London. The back of the bench is inscribed with the words &quot;Reasons to Be Cheerful&quot;, the title of one of Dury&#x27;s songs. The QR codes on the arms of the bench allow visitors to listen to a track listing of his songs on one side and his appearance on Desert Island Discs on the other.

In 1999 the autobiographical documentary &quot;On My Life&quot;, directed by Mike Connolly, was released. The film, in which Dury recalled his life and career, intercut with concert footage, included contributions from painter Peter Blake, Jemima and Baxter Dury, and members of the Blockheads. The programme was first broadcast in 1999 and again in August 2009 on BBC Four.

Between 6 January and 14 February 2009 a musical about his life, entitled &quot;Hit Me! The Life &amp; Rhymes of Ian Dury&quot;, was premiered and ran at the Leicester Square Theatre in London.

A biopic entitled &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot; starring Andy Serkis as Dury was released on 8 January 2010, and was nominated for several awards. Ray Winstone and Naomie Harris also appeared. The title of the film is derived from Dury&#x27;s 1977 7&quot; single &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. Also in 2010 music journalist Will Birch published &quot;Ian Dury: The Definitive Biography&quot; which was well received.

A musical, &quot;Reasons to be Cheerful&quot;, was produced by the Graeae Theatre Company in association with Theatre Royal Stratford East and New Wolsey Theatre. Set in 1979 the musical featured Dury classics in a &quot;riotous coming-of-age tale&quot;. The 2010 production was supported by the Blockheads, while Sir Peter Blake donated a limited edition print of the &quot;Reasons to be Cheerful&quot; artwork.

Interviewed by the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in 2010, son Baxter said his father &quot;was like a &quot;Polaris missile&quot;... &quot;He would seek out someone&#x27;s weakness in seconds, and then lock onto it. That&#x27;s how he controlled his environment. It was very funny, in a gruesome kind of way ... if it wasn&#x27;t you he was picking on. But it was a strange obsession, too. Like, why do you want to be like that? He was never really physically violent he was a small disabled guy but there was a lot of mental violence.&quot;

Speaking to BBC Radio 2 in February 2021, English pop star Robbie Williams cited Dury as his biggest inspiration as a lyricist. Williams sings on the final track of the posthumously released album &quot;Ten More Turnips from the Tip&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Dury married Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Rathmell on 3 June 1967 in Barnstaple, Devon, and they had two children, Jemima and Baxter, in 1969 and 1971, respectively. In 1973 Dury left the family, who were living at the time in a Buckinghamshire village, and moved back to London to pursue his music career.

He lived with his partner Denise Roudette for six years after he moved back to London, renting 40 Oval Mansions in Kennington, which &quot;The Guardian&quot; referred to as &quot;one of London&#x27;s most notorious squatted buildings&quot; and Dury himself dubbed &quot;Catshit Mansions&quot;.

Dury and Rathmell divorced in 1985 but remained close. Starting in 1986 he had a year-long relationship with actor Jane Horrocks, whom he met while they both performed in Jim Cartright&#x27;s play &quot;Road&quot; and they remained friends until his death.

Dury married sculptor Sophy Tilson in 1998, with whom he had two children.

<text>A fairy tale (alternative names include fairytale, fairy story, household tale, magic tale, or wonder tale) is a short story that belongs to the folklore genre. Such stories typically feature magic, enchantments, and mythical or fanciful beings. In most cultures, there is no clear line separating myth from folk or fairy tale; all these together form the literature of preliterate societies. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicit moral tales, including beast fables. Prevalent elements include dragons, dwarfs, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, griffins, merfolk, monsters, monarchy, pixies, talking animals, trolls, unicorns, witches, wizards, magic, and enchantments.

In less technical contexts, the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness, as in &quot;fairy-tale ending&quot; (a happy ending) or &quot;fairy-tale romance&quot;. Colloquially, the term &quot;fairy tale&quot; or &quot;fairy story&quot; can also mean any far-fetched story or tall tale; it is used especially to describe any story that not only not true, but also could not possibly be true. Legends are perceived as real within their culture; fairy tales may merge into legends, where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth. However, unlike legends and epics, fairy tales usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and to actual places, people, and events; they take place &quot;once upon a time&quot; rather than in actual times.

Fairy tales occur both in oral and in literary form (literary fairy tale); the name &quot;fairy tale&quot; (&quot;&quot; in French) was first ascribed to them by Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy in the late 17th century. Many of today&#x27;s fairy tales have evolved from centuries-old stories that have appeared, with variations, in multiple cultures around the world.

The history of the fairy tale is particularly difficult to trace because often only the literary forms survive. Still, according to researchers at universities in Durham and Lisbon, such stories may date back thousands of years, some to the Bronze Age. Fairy tales, and works derived from fairy tales, are still written today.

Folklorists have classified fairy tales in various ways. The Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index and the morphological analysis of Vladimir Propp are among the most notable. Other folklorists have interpreted the tales&#x27; significance, but no school has been definitively established for the meaning of the tales.

==Terminology==
Some folklorists prefer to use the German term or &quot;wonder tale&quot; to refer to the genre rather than &quot;fairy tale&quot;, a practice given weight by the definition of Thompson in his 1977 [1946] edition of &quot;The Folktale&quot;:
The characters and motifs of fairy tales are simple and archetypal: princesses and goose-girls; youngest sons and gallant princes; ogres, giants, dragons, and trolls; wicked stepmothers and false heroes; fairy godmothers and other magical helpers, often talking horses, or foxes, or birds; glass mountains; and prohibitions and breaking of prohibitions.

==Definition==

Although the fairy tale is a distinct genre within the larger category of folktale, the definition that marks a work as a fairy tale is a source of considerable dispute. The term itself comes from the translation of Madame D&#x27;Aulnoy&#x27;s &quot;Conte de fées&quot;, first used in her collection in 1697. Common parlance conflates fairy tales with beast fables and other folktales, and scholars differ on the degree to which the presence of fairies and/or similarly mythical beings (e.g., elves, goblins, trolls, giants, huge monsters, or mermaids) should be taken as a differentiator. Vladimir Propp, in his &quot;Morphology of the Folktale&quot;, criticized the common distinction between &quot;fairy tales&quot; and &quot;animal tales&quot; on the grounds that many tales contained both fantastic elements and animals. Nevertheless, to select works for his analysis, Propp used all Russian folktales classified as a folklore, Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index 300–749,in a cataloguing system that made such a distinctionto gain a clear set of tales. His own analysis identified fairy tales by their plot elements, but that in itself has been criticized, as the analysis does not lend itself easily to tales that do not involve a quest, and furthermore, the same plot elements are found in non-fairy tale works.

As Stith Thompson points out, talking animals and the presence of magic seem to be more common to the fairy tale than fairies themselves. However, the mere presence of animals that talk does not make a tale a fairy tale, especially when the animal is clearly a mask on a human face, as in fables.

In his essay &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot;, J.R.R.Tolkien agreed with the exclusion of &quot;fairies&quot; from the definition, defining fairy tales as stories about the adventures of men in &quot;Faërie&quot;, the land of fairies, fairytale princes and princesses, dwarves, elves, and not only other magical species but many other marvels. However, the same essay excludes tales that are often considered fairy tales, citing as an example &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Heart&quot;, which Andrew Lang included in &quot;The Lilac Fairy Book&quot;.

Steven Swann Jones identified the presence of magic as the feature by which fairy tales can be distinguished from other sorts of folktales. Davidson and Chaudri identify &quot;transformation&quot; as the key feature of the genre. From a psychological point of view, Jean Chiriac argued for the necessity of the fantastic in these narratives.

In terms of aesthetic values, Italo Calvino cited the fairy tale as a prime example of &quot;quickness&quot; in literature, because of the economy and concision of the tales.

===History of the genre===

Originally, stories that would contemporarily be considered fairy tales were not marked out as a separate genre. The German term &quot; stems from the old German word &quot;, which means news or tale. The word &quot; is the diminutive of the word &quot;, therefore it means a &quot;little story&quot;. Together with the common beginning &quot;once upon a time&quot;, this tells us that a fairy tale or a märchen was originally a little story from a long time ago when the world was still magic. (Indeed, one less regular German opening is &quot;In the old times when wishing was still effective&quot;.)

The French writers and adaptors of the &quot;conte&quot; &quot;de fées&quot; genre often included fairies in their stories; the genre name became &quot;fairy tale&quot; in English translation and &quot;gradually eclipsed the more general term &quot;folk&quot; tale that covered a wide variety of oral tales&quot;. Jack Zipes also attributes this shift to changing sociopolitical conditions in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that led to the trivialization of these stories by the upper classes.

Roots of the genre come from different oral stories passed down in European cultures. The genre was first marked out by writers of the Renaissance, such as Giovanni Francesco Straparola and Giambattista Basile, and stabilized through the works of later collectors such as Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm. In this evolution, the name was coined when the &quot;précieuses&quot; took up writing literary stories; Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy invented the term &quot;Conte de fée&quot;, or fairy tale, in the late 17th century.

Before the definition of the genre of fantasy, many works that would now be classified as fantasy were termed &quot;fairy tales&quot;, including Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, and L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. Indeed, Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; includes discussions of world-building and is considered a vital part of fantasy criticism. Although fantasy, particularly the subgenre of fairytale fantasy, draws heavily on fairy tale motifs, the genres are now regarded as distinct.

===Folk and literary===
The fairy tale, told orally, is a sub-class of the folktale. Many writers have written in the form of the fairy tale. These are the literary fairy tales, or . The oldest forms, from &quot;Panchatantra&quot; to the &quot;Pentamerone&quot;, show considerable reworking from the oral form. The Grimm brothers were among the first to try to preserve the features of oral tales. Yet the stories printed under the Grimm name have been considerably reworked to fit the written form.

Literary fairy tales and oral fairy tales freely exchanged plots, motifs, and elements with one another and with the tales of foreign lands. The literary fairy tale came into fashion during the 17th century, developed by aristocratic women as a parlour game. This, in turn, helped to maintain the oral tradition. According to Jack Zipes, &quot;The subject matter of the conversations consisted of literature, mores, taste, and etiquette, whereby the speakers all endeavoured to portray ideal situations in the most effective oratorical style that would gradually have a major effect on literary forms.&quot; Many 18th-century folklorists attempted to recover the &quot;pure&quot; folktale, uncontaminated by literary versions. Yet while oral fairy tales likely existed for thousands of years before the literary forms, there is no pure folktale, and each literary fairy tale draws on folk traditions, if only in parody. This makes it impossible to trace forms of transmission of a fairy tale. Oral story-tellers have been known to read literary fairy tales to increase their own stock of stories and treatments.

==History==
The oral tradition of the fairy tale came long before the written page. Tales were told or enacted dramatically, rather than written down, and handed down from generation to generation. Because of this, the history of their development is necessarily obscure and blurred. Fairy tales appear, now and again, in written literature throughout literate cultures, as in &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, which includes &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; (Roman, 100–200 AD), or the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; (India 3rd century BC), but it is unknown to what extent these reflect the actual folk tales even of their own time. The stylistic evidence indicates that these, and many later collections, reworked folk tales into literary forms. What they do show is that the fairy tale has ancient roots, older than the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; collection of magical tales (compiled &quot;circa&quot; 1500 AD), such as &quot;Vikram and the Vampire&quot;, and &quot;Bel and the Dragon&quot;. Besides such collections and individual tales, in China Taoist philosophers such as Liezi and Zhuangzi recounted fairy tales in their philosophical works. In the broader definition of the genre, the first famous Western fairy tales are those of Aesop (6th century BC) in ancient Greece.

Scholarship points out that Medieval literature contains early versions or predecessors of later known tales and motifs, such as the grateful dead, The Bird Lover or the quest for the lost wife. Recognizable folktales have also been reworked as the plot of folk literature and oral epics.

Jack Zipes writes in &quot;When Dreams Came True&quot;, &quot;There are fairy tale elements in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, and in many of William Shakespeare plays.&quot; &quot;King Lear&quot; can be considered a literary variant of fairy tales such as &quot;Water and Salt&quot; and &quot;Cap O&#x27; Rushes&quot;. The tale itself resurfaced in Western literature in the 16th and 17th centuries, with &quot;The Facetious Nights of Straparola&quot; by Giovanni Francesco Straparola (Italy, 1550 and 1553), which contains many fairy tales in its inset tales, and the Neapolitan tales of Giambattista Basile (Naples, 1634–36), which are all fairy tales. Carlo Gozzi made use of many fairy tale motifs among his Commedia dell&#x27;Arte scenarios, including among them one based on &quot;The Love For Three Oranges&quot; (1761). Simultaneously, Pu Songling, in China, included many fairy tales in his collection, &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot; (published posthumously, 1766), which has been described by Yuken Fujita of Keio University as having &quot;a reputation as the most outstanding short story collection.&quot; The fairy tale itself became popular among the &quot;précieuses&quot; of upper-class France (1690–1710), and among the tales told in that time were the ones of La Fontaine and the &quot;Contes&quot; of Charles Perrault (1697), who fixed the forms of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Although Straparola&#x27;s, Basile&#x27;s and Perrault&#x27;s collections contain the oldest known forms of various fairy tales, on the stylistic evidence, all the writers rewrote the tales for literary effect.

===The Salon Era===

In the mid-17th century, a vogue for magical tales emerged among the intellectuals who frequented the salons of Paris. These salons were regular gatherings hosted by prominent aristocratic women, where women and men could gather together to discuss the issues of the day.

In the 1630s, aristocratic women began to gather in their own living rooms, salons, to discuss the topics of their choice: arts and letters, politics, and social matters of immediate concern to the women of their class: marriage, love, financial and physical independence, and access to education. This was a time when women were barred from receiving a formal education. Some of the most gifted women writers of the period came out of these early salons (such as Madeleine de Scudéry and Madame de Lafayette), which encouraged women&#x27;s independence and pushed against the gender barriers that defined their lives. The salonnières argued particularly for love and intellectual compatibility between the sexes, opposing the system of arranged marriages.

Sometime in the middle of the 17th century, a passion for the conversational parlour game based on the plots of old folk tales swept through the salons. Each salonnière was called upon to retell an old tale or rework an old theme, spinning clever new stories that not only showcased verbal agility and imagination but also slyly commented on the conditions of aristocratic life. Great emphasis was placed on a mode of delivery that seemed natural and spontaneous. The decorative language of the fairy tales served an important function: disguising the rebellious subtext of the stories and sliding them past the court censors. Critiques of court life (and even of the king) were embedded in extravagant tales and in dark, sharply dystopian ones. Not surprisingly, the tales by women often featured young (but clever) aristocratic girls whose lives were controlled by the arbitrary whims of fathers, kings, and elderly wicked fairies, as well as tales in which groups of wise fairies (i.e., intelligent, independent women) stepped in and put all to rights.

The salon tales as they were originally written and published have been preserved in a monumental work called &quot;Le Cabinet des Fées&quot;, an enormous collection of stories from the 17th and 18th centuries.

===Later works===
The first collectors to attempt to preserve not only the plot and characters of the tale, but also the style in which they were told, was the Brothers Grimm, collecting German fairy tales; ironically, this meant although their first edition (1812 &amp; 1815) remains a treasure for folklorists, they rewrote the tales in later editions to make them more acceptable, which ensured their sales and the later popularity of their work.

Such literary forms did not merely draw from the folktale, but also influenced folktales in turn. The Brothers Grimm rejected several tales for their collection, though told orally to them by Germans, because the tales derived from Perrault, and they concluded they were thereby French and not German tales; an oral version of &quot;Bluebeard&quot; was thus rejected, and the tale of &quot;Little Briar Rose&quot;, clearly related to Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, was included only because Jacob Grimm convinced his brother that the figure of Brynhildr, from much earlier Norse mythology, proved that the sleeping princess was authentically Germanic folklore.

This consideration of whether to keep &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; reflected a belief common among folklorists of the 19th century: that the folk tradition preserved fairy tales in forms from pre-history except when &quot;contaminated&quot; by such literary forms, leading people to tell inauthentic tales. The rural, illiterate, and uneducated peasants, if suitably isolated, were the &quot;folk&quot; and would tell pure &quot;folk&quot; tales. Sometimes they regarded fairy tales as a form of fossil, the remnants of a once-perfect tale. However, further research has concluded that fairy tales never had a fixed form, and regardless of literary influence, the tellers constantly altered them for their own purposes.

The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of romantic nationalism, that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. Among those influenced were the Russian Alexander Afanasyev (first published in 1866), the Norwegians Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe (first published in 1845), the Romanian Petre Ispirescu (first published in 1874), the English Joseph Jacobs (first published in 1890), and Jeremiah Curtin, an American who collected Irish tales (first published in 1890). Ethnographers collected fairy tales throughout the world, finding similar tales in Africa, the Americas, and Australia; Andrew Lang was able to draw on not only the written tales of Europe and Asia, but those collected by ethnographers, to fill his &quot;coloured&quot; fairy books series. They also encouraged other collectors of fairy tales, as when Yei Theodora Ozaki created a collection, &quot;Japanese Fairy Tales&quot; (1908), after encouragement from Lang. Simultaneously, writers such as Hans Christian Andersen and George MacDonald continued the tradition of literary fairy tales. Andersen&#x27;s work sometimes drew on old folktales, but more often deployed fairytale motifs and plots in new tales. MacDonald incorporated fairytale motifs both in new literary fairy tales, such as &quot;The Light Princess&quot;, and in works of the genre that would become fantasy, as in &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; or &quot;Lilith&quot;.

==Cross-cultural transmission==

Two theories of origins have attempted to explain the common elements in fairy tales found spread over continents. One is that a single point of origin generated any given tale, which then spread over the centuries; the other is that such fairy tales stem from common human experience and therefore can appear separately in many different origins.

Fairy tales with very similar plots, characters, and motifs are found spread across many different cultures. Many researchers hold this to be caused by the spread of such tales, as people repeat tales they have heard in foreign lands, although the oral nature makes it impossible to trace the route except by inference. Folklorists have attempted to determine the origin by internal evidence, which can not always be clear; Joseph Jacobs, comparing the Scottish tale &quot;The Ridere of Riddles&quot; with the version collected by the Brothers Grimm, &quot;The Riddle&quot;, noted that in &quot;The Ridere of Riddles&quot; one hero ends up polygamously married, which might point to an ancient custom, but in &quot;The Riddle&quot;, the simpler riddle might argue greater antiquity.

Folklorists of the &quot;Finnish&quot; (or historical-geographical) school attempted to place fairy tales to their origin, with inconclusive results. Sometimes influence, especially within a limited area and time, is clearer, as when considering the influence of Perrault&#x27;s tales on those collected by the Brothers Grimm. &quot;Little Briar-Rose&quot; appears to stem from Perrault&#x27;s &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, as the Grimms&#x27; tale appears to be the only independent German variant. Similarly, the close agreement between the opening of the Grimms&#x27; version of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; and Perrault&#x27;s tale points to an influence, although the Grimms&#x27; version adds a different ending (perhaps derived from &quot;The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids&quot;).
Fairy tales tend to take on the color of their location, through the choice of motifs, the style in which they are told, and the depiction of character and local color.

The Brothers Grimm believed that European fairy tales derived from the cultural history shared by all Indo-European peoples and were therefore ancient, far older than written records. This view is supported by research by the anthropologist Jamie Tehrani and the folklorist Sara Graca Da Silva using phylogenetic analysis, a technique developed by evolutionary biologists to trace the relatedness of living and fossil species. Among the tales analysed were &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, traced to the time of splitting of Eastern and Western Indo-European, over 5000 years ago. Both &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot; appear to have been created some 4000 years ago. The story of &quot;The Smith and the Devil&quot; (Deal with the Devil) appears to date from the Bronze Age, some 6000 years ago. Various other studies converge to suggest that some fairy tales, for example the swan maiden, could go back to the Upper Palaeolithic.

==Association with children==
Originally, adults were the audience of a fairy tale just as often as children. Literary fairy tales appeared in works intended for adults, but in the 19th and 20th centuries the fairy tale became associated with children&#x27;s literature.

The &quot;précieuses&quot;, including Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy, intended their works for adults, but regarded their source as the tales that servants, or other women of lower class, would tell to children. Indeed, a novel of that time, depicting a countess&#x27;s suitor offering to tell such a tale, has the countess exclaim that she loves fairy tales as if she were still a child. Among the late &quot;précieuses&quot;, Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont redacted a version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; for children, and it is her tale that is best known today. The Brothers Grimm titled their collection &quot;Children&#x27;s and Household Tales&quot; and rewrote their tales after complaints that they were not suitable for children.

In the modern era, fairy tales were altered so that they could be read to children. The Brothers Grimm concentrated mostly on sexual references; Rapunzel, in the first edition, revealed the prince&#x27;s visits by asking why her clothing had grown tight, thus letting the witch deduce that she was pregnant, but in subsequent editions carelessly revealed that it was easier to pull up the prince than the witch. On the other hand, in many respects, violenceparticularly when punishing villainswas increased. Other, later, revisions cut out violence; J.R.R.Tolkien noted that &quot;The Juniper Tree&quot; often had its cannibalistic stew cut out in a version intended for children. The moralizing strain in the Victorian era altered the classical tales to teach lessons, as when George Cruikshank rewrote &quot;Cinderella&quot; in 1854 to contain temperance themes. His acquaintance Charles Dickens protested, &quot;In an utilitarian age, of all other times, it is a matter of grave importance that fairy tales should be respected.&quot;

Psychoanalysts such as Bruno Bettelheim, who regarded the cruelty of older fairy tales as indicative of psychological conflicts, strongly criticized this expurgation, because it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues. Fairy tales do teach children how to deal with difficult times. To quote Rebecca Walters (2017, ) &quot;Fairytales and folktales are part of the cultural conserve that can be used to address children&#x27;s fears…. and give them some role training in an approach that honors the children&#x27;s window of tolerance&quot;. These fairy tales teach children how to deal with certain social situations and helps them to find their place in society. Fairy tales teach children other important lessons too. For example, Tsitsani et al. carried out a study on children to determine the benefits of fairy tales. Parents of the children who took part in the study found that fairy tales, especially the color in them, triggered their child&#x27;s imagination as they read them. Jungian Analyst and fairy tale scholar Marie Louise Von Franz interprets fairy tales based on Jung&#x27;s view of fairy tales as a spontaneous and naive product of soul, which can only express what soul is. That means, she looks at fairy tales as images of different phases of experiencing the reality of the soul. They are the &quot;purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes&quot; and &quot;they represent the archetypes in their simplest, barest and most concise form&quot; because they are less overlaid with conscious material than myths and legends. &quot;In this pure form, the archetypal images afford us the best clues to the understanding of the processes going on in the collective psyche&quot;. &quot;The fairy tale itself is its own best explanation; that is, its meaning is contained in the totality of its motifs connected by the thread of the story. [...] Every fairy tale is a relatively closed system compounding one essential psychological meaning which is expressed in a series of symbolical pictures and events and is discoverable in these&quot;. &quot;I have come to the conclusion that all fairy tales endeavour to describe one and the same psychic fact, but a fact so complex and far-reaching and so difficult for us to realize in all its different aspects that hundreds of tales and thousands of repetitions with a musician&#x27;s variation are needed until this unknown fact is delivered into consciousness; and even then the theme is not exhausted. This unknown fact is what Jung calls the Self, which is the psychic reality of the collective unconscious. [...] Every archetype is in its essence only one aspect of the collective unconscious as well as always representing also the whole collective unconscious.

Other famous people commented on the importance of fairy tales, especially for children. For example, G. K. Chesterton argued that &quot;Fairy tales, then, are not responsible for producing in children fear, or any of the shapes of fear; fairy tales do not give the child the idea of the evil or the ugly; that is in the child already, because it is in the world already. Fairy tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What fairy tales give the child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of bogey. The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the dragon.&quot; Albert Einstein once showed how important he believed fairy tales were for children&#x27;s intelligence in the quote &quot;If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairytales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairytales.&quot;

The adaptation of fairy tales for children continues. Walt Disney&#x27;s influential &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was largely (although certainly not solely) intended for the children&#x27;s market. The anime &quot;Magical Princess Minky Momo&quot; draws on the fairy tale &quot;Momotarō&quot;. Jack Zipes has spent many years working to make the older traditional stories accessible to modern readers and their children.

==Motherhood==
Many fairy tales feature an absentee mother, as an example &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; and &quot;Donkeyskin&quot;, where the mother is deceased or absent and unable to help the heroines. Mothers are depicted as absent or wicked in the most popular contemporary versions of tales like &quot;Rapunzel&quot;, &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, however,
some lesser known tales or variants such as those found in volumes edited by Angela Carter and Jane Yolen depict mothers in a more positive light.

Carter&#x27;s protagonist in &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; is an impoverished piano student married to a Marquis who was much older than herself to &quot;banish the spectre of poverty&quot;. The story is a variant on Bluebeard, a tale about a wealthy man who murders numerous young women. Carter&#x27;s protagonist, who is unnamed, describes her mother as &quot;eagle-featured&quot; and &quot;indomitable&quot;. Her mother is depicted as a woman who is prepared for violence, instead of hiding from it or sacrificing herself to it. The protagonist recalls how her mother kept an &quot;antique service revolver&quot; and once &quot;shot a man-eating tiger with her own hand.&quot;

==Contemporary tales==

===Literary===

In contemporary literature, many authors have used the form of fairy tales for various reasons, such as examining the human condition from the simple framework a fairytale provides. Some authors seek to recreate a sense of the fantastic in a contemporary discourse. Some writers use fairy tale forms for modern issues; this can include using the psychological dramas implicit in the story, as when Robin McKinley retold &quot;Donkeyskin&quot; as the novel &quot;Deerskin&quot;, with emphasis on the abusive treatment the father of the tale dealt to his daughter. Sometimes, especially in children&#x27;s literature, fairy tales are retold with a twist simply for comic effect, such as &quot;The Stinky Cheese Man&quot; by Jon Scieszka and &quot;The ASBO Fairy Tales&quot; by Chris Pilbeam. A common comic motif is a world where all the fairy tales take place, and the characters are aware of their role in the story, such as in the film series &quot;Shrek&quot;.

Other authors may have specific motives, such as multicultural or feminist reevaluations of predominantly Eurocentric masculine-dominated fairy tales, implying critique of older narratives. The figure of the damsel in distress has been particularly attacked by many feminist critics. Examples of narrative reversal rejecting this figure include &quot;The Paperbag Princess&quot; by Robert Munsch, a picture book aimed at children in which a princess rescues a prince, Angela Carter&#x27;s &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;, which retells a number of fairy tales from a female point of view and Simon Hood&#x27;s contemporary interpretation of various popular classics.

There are also many contemporary erotic retellings of fairy tales, which explicitly draw upon the original spirit of the tales, and are specifically for adults. Modern retellings focus on exploring the tale through use of the erotic, explicit sexuality, dark and/or comic themes, female empowerment, fetish and BDSM, multicultural, and heterosexual characters. Cleis Press has released several fairy tale-themed erotic anthologies, including &quot;Fairy Tale Lust&quot;, &quot;Lustfully Ever After&quot;, and &quot;A Princess Bound&quot;.

It may be hard to lay down the rule between fairy tales and fantasies that use fairy tale motifs, or even whole plots, but the distinction is commonly made, even within the works of a single author: George MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;Lilith&quot; and &quot;Phantastes&quot; are regarded as fantasies, while his &quot;The Light Princess&quot;, &quot;The Golden Key&quot;, and &quot;The Wise Woman&quot; are commonly called fairy tales. The most notable distinction is that fairytale fantasies, like other fantasies, make use of novelistic writing conventions of prose, characterization, or setting.

===Film===

Fairy tales have been enacted dramatically; records exist of this in commedia dell&#x27;arte, and later in pantomime. Unlike oral and literacy form, fairy tales in film is considered one of the most effective way to convey the story to the audience. The advent of cinema has meant that such stories could be presented in a more plausible manner, with the use of special effects and animation. The Walt Disney Company has had a significant impact on the evolution of the fairy tale film. Some of the earliest short silent films from the Disney studio were based on fairy tales, and some fairy tales were adapted into shorts in the musical comedy series &quot;Silly Symphony&quot;, such as &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;. Walt Disney&#x27;s first feature-length film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, released in 1937, was a ground-breaking film for fairy tales and, indeed, fantasy in general. With the cost of over 400 percent of the budget and more than 300 artists, assistants and animators, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was arguably one of the highest work force demanded film at that time. The studio even hired Don Graham to open animation training programs for more than 700 staffs. As for the motion capture and personality expression, the studio used a dancer, Marjorie Celeste, from the beginning to the end for the best results. Disney and his creative successors have returned to traditional and literary fairy tales numerous times with films such as &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950), &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959), &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989) and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991). Disney&#x27;s influence helped establish the fairy tale genre as a genre for children, and has been accused by some of bowdlerizing the gritty naturalism – and sometimes unhappy endings – of many folk fairy tales. However, others note that the softening of fairy tales occurred long before Disney, some of which was even done by the Grimm brothers themselves.

Many filmed fairy tales have been made primarily for children, from Disney&#x27;s later works to Aleksandr Rou&#x27;s retelling of &quot;Vasilissa the Beautiful&quot;, the first Soviet film to use Russian folk tales in a big-budget feature. Others have used the conventions of fairy tales to create new stories with sentiments more relevant to contemporary life, as in &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, &quot;Happily N&#x27;Ever After&quot;, and the films of Michel Ocelot.

Other works have retold familiar fairy tales in a darker, more horrific or psychological variant aimed primarily at adults. Notable examples are Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot;, based on Angela Carter&#x27;s retelling of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;. Likewise, &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;, &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;Suspiria&quot;, and &quot;Spike&quot; create new stories in this genre from fairy tale and folklore motifs.

In comics and animated TV series, &quot;The Sandman&quot;, &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot;, &quot;Princess Tutu&quot;, &quot;Fables&quot; and &quot;MÄR&quot; all make use of standard fairy tale elements to various extents but are more accurately categorised as fairytale fantasy due to the definite locations and characters which a longer narrative requires.

A more modern cinematic fairy tale would be Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;Le Notti Bianche&quot;, starring Marcello Mastroianni before he became a superstar. It involves many of the romantic conventions of fairy tales, yet it takes place in post-World War II Italy, and it ends realistically.

In recent years, Disney has been dominating the fairy tale film industry by remaking their animated fairy tale films into live action. Examples include &quot;Maleficent&quot; (2014), &quot;Cinderella&quot; (2015), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (2017) and so on.

==Motifs==

Any comparison of fairy tales quickly discovers that many fairy tales have features in common with each other. Two of the most influential classifications are those of Antti Aarne, as revised by Stith Thompson into the Aarne-Thompson classification system, and Vladimir Propp&#x27;s &quot;Morphology of the Folk Tale&quot;.

===Aarne-Thompson===
This system groups fairy and folk tales according to their overall plot. Common, identifying features are picked out to decide which tales are grouped together. Much therefore depends on what features are regarded as decisive.

For instance, tales like &quot;Cinderella&quot;in which a persecuted heroine, with the help of the fairy godmother or similar magical helper, attends an event (or three) in which she wins the love of a prince and is identified as his true brideare classified as type 510, the persecuted heroine. Some such tales are &quot;The Wonderful Birch&quot;; &quot;Aschenputtel&quot;; &quot;Katie Woodencloak&quot;; &quot;The Story of Tam and Cam&quot;; &quot;Ye Xian&quot;; &quot;Cap O&#x27; Rushes&quot;; &quot;Catskin&quot;; &quot;Fair, Brown and Trembling&quot;; &quot;Finette Cendron&quot;; &quot;Allerleirauh&quot;.

Further analysis of the tales shows that in &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;The Wonderful Birch&quot;, &quot;The Story of Tam and Cam&quot;, &quot;Ye Xian&quot;, and &quot;Aschenputtel&quot;, the heroine is persecuted by her stepmother and refused permission to go to the ball or other event, and in &quot;Fair, Brown and Trembling&quot; and &quot;Finette Cendron&quot; by her sisters and other female figures, and these are grouped as 510A; while in &quot;Cap O&#x27; Rushes&quot;, &quot;Catskin&quot;, and &quot;Allerleirauh&quot;, the heroine is driven from home by her father&#x27;s persecutions, and must take work in a kitchen elsewhere, and these are grouped as 510B. But in &quot;Katie Woodencloak&quot;, she is driven from home by her stepmother&#x27;s persecutions and must take service in a kitchen elsewhere, and in &quot;Tattercoats&quot;, she is refused permission to go to the ball by her grandfather. Given these features common with both types of 510, &quot;Katie Woodencloak&quot; is classified as 510A because the villain is the stepmother, and &quot;Tattercoats&quot; as 510B because the grandfather fills the father&#x27;s role.

This system has its weaknesses in the difficulty of having no way to classify subportions of a tale as motifs. &quot;Rapunzel&quot; is type 310 (The Maiden in the Tower), but it opens with a child being demanded in return for stolen food, as does &quot;Puddocky&quot;; but &quot;Puddocky&quot; is not a Maiden in the Tower tale, while &quot;The Canary Prince&quot;, which opens with a jealous stepmother, is.

It also lends itself to emphasis on the common elements, to the extent that the folklorist describes &quot;The Black Bull of Norroway&quot; as the same story as &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. This can be useful as a shorthand but can also erase the coloring and details of a story.

===Morphology===

Vladimir Propp specifically studied a collection of Russian fairy tales, but his analysis has been found useful for the tales of other countries. Having criticized Aarne-Thompson type analysis for ignoring what motifs &quot;did&quot; in stories, and because the motifs used were not clearly distinct, he analyzed the tales for the &quot;function&quot; each character and action fulfilled and concluded that a tale was composed of thirty-one elements (&#x27;functions&#x27;) and seven characters or &#x27;spheres of action&#x27; (&#x27;the princess and her father&#x27; are a single sphere). While the elements were not all required for all tales, when they appeared they did so in an invariant order – except that each individual element might be negated twice, so that it would appear three times, as when, in &quot;Brother and Sister&quot;, the brother resists drinking from enchanted streams twice, so that it is the third that enchants him. Propp&#x27;s 31 functions also fall within six &#x27;stages&#x27; (preparation, complication, transference, struggle, return, recognition), and a stage can also be repeated, which can affect the perceived order of elements.

One such element is the &quot;donor&quot; who gives the hero magical assistance, often after testing him. In &quot;The Golden Bird&quot;, the talking fox tests the hero by warning him against entering an inn and, after he succeeds, helps him find the object of his quest; in &quot;The Boy Who Drew Cats&quot;, the priest advised the hero to stay in small places at night, which protects him from an evil spirit; in &quot;Cinderella&quot;, the fairy godmother gives Cinderella the dresses she needs to attend the ball, as their mothers&#x27; spirits do in &quot;Bawang Putih Bawang Merah&quot; and &quot;The Wonderful Birch&quot;; in &quot;The Fox Sister&quot;, a Buddhist monk gives the brothers magical bottles to protect against the fox spirit. The roles can be more complicated. In &quot;The Red Ettin&quot;, the role is split into the motherwho offers the hero the whole of a journey cake with her curse or half with her blessingand when he takes the half, a fairy who gives him advice; in &quot;Mr Simigdáli&quot;, the sun, the moon, and the stars all give the heroine a magical gift. Characters who are not always the donor can act like the donor. In &quot;Kallo and the Goblins&quot;, the villain goblins also give the heroine gifts, because they are tricked; in &quot;Schippeitaro&quot;, the evil cats betray their secret to the hero, giving him the means to defeat them. Other fairy tales, such as &quot;The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was&quot;, do not feature the donor.

Analogies have been drawn between this and the analysis of myths into the hero&#x27;s journey.

==Interpretations==

Many fairy tales have been interpreted for their (purported) significance. One mythological interpretation saw many fairy tales, including &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and &quot;The Frog King&quot;, as solar myths; this mode of interpretation subsequently became rather less popular. Freudian, Jungian, and other psychological analyses have also explicated many tales, but no mode of interpretation has established itself definitively.

Specific analyses have often been criticized for lending great importance to motifs that are not, in fact, integral to the tale; this has often stemmed from treating one instance of a fairy tale as the definitive text, where the tale has been told and retold in many variations. In variants of &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, the wife&#x27;s curiosity is betrayed by a blood-stained key, by an egg&#x27;s breaking, or by the singing of a rose she wore, without affecting the tale, but interpretations of specific variants have claimed that the precise object is integral to the tale.

Other folklorists have interpreted tales as historical documents. Many German folklorists, believing the tales to have preserved details from ancient times, have used the Grimms&#x27; tales to explain ancient customs.

One approach sees the topography of European Märchen as echoing the period immediately following the last Ice Age.
Other folklorists have explained the figure of the wicked stepmother in a historical/sociological context: many women did die in childbirth, their husbands remarried, and the new stepmothers competed with the children of the first marriage for resources.

In a 2012 lecture, Jack Zipes reads fairy tales as examples of what he calls &quot;childism&quot;. He suggests that there are terrible aspects to the tales, which (among other things) have conditioned children to accept mistreatment and even abuse.

== Fairy tales in music ==
Fairy tales have inspired music, namely opera, such as the French Opéra féerie and the German Märchenoper. French examples include Gretry&#x27;s &quot;Zémire et Azor&quot;, and Auber&#x27;s &quot;Le cheval de bronze&quot;, German operas are Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot;, Siegfried Wagner&#x27;s &quot;An allem ist Hütchen schuld!&quot;, which is based on many fairy tales, and Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Die Kluge&quot;.

Ballet, too, is fertile ground for bringing fairy tales to life. Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s first ballet, The Firebird uses elements from various classic Russian tales in that work.

Even contemporary fairy tales have been written for the purpose of inspiration in the music world. &quot;Raven Girl&quot; by Audrey Niffenegger was written to inspire a new dance for the Royal Ballet in London. The song &quot;Singring and the Glass Guitar&quot; by the American band Utopia, recorded for their album &quot;Ra&quot;, is called &quot;An Electrified Fairytale&quot;. Composed by the four members of the band, Roger Powell, Kasim Sulton, Willie Wilcox and Todd Rundgren, it tells the story of the theft of the Glass Guitar by Evil Forces, which has to be recovered by the four heroes.

<doc id="43496" wikidata="Q1317158" url="?curid=43496" title="Frank Robinson">
<text>Frank Robinson (August 31, 1935 – February 7, 2019), nicknamed &quot;the Judge&quot;, was an American professional baseball outfielder and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for five teams over 21 seasons: the Cincinnati Reds (1956–1965), Baltimore Orioles (1966–1971), Los Angeles Dodgers (1972), California Angels (1973–1974), and Cleveland Indians (1974–1976). In 1975, Robinson became the first Black manager in big-league history, as the player-manager of the Indians.

The first player to be named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), Robinson was named the NL MVP after leading the Cincinnati Reds to the pennant in and was named the AL MVP in with the Baltimore Orioles after winning the Triple Crown; Robinson&#x27;s 49 home runs (HR) that year tied for the most by any AL player between and , and stood as a franchise record for 30 years. He helped lead the Orioles to the first two World Series titles in franchise history in 1966 and 1970, and was named the Series MVP in 1966 after leading the Orioles to a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

A 14-time All-Star, Robinson batted .300 nine times, hit 30 home runs 11 times, and led his league in slugging four times and in runs scored three times. His 586 career home runs ranked fourth in major league history at the time of his retirement, and he ranked sixth in total bases (5,373) and extra-base hits (1,186), eighth in games played (2,808), and ninth in runs scored (1,829). His 2,943 career hits are the most since by any player who fell short of the 3,000-hit mark. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1982.

After managing the Indians, Robinson went on to manage the San Francisco Giants, Baltimore Orioles, and Montreal Expos / Washington Nationals. For most of the last two decades of his life, Robinson served in various executive positions for Major League Baseball concluding his career as honorary president of the American League.

==Early life==
Robinson was born in Beaumont, Texas. He was the youngest of Ruth Shaw&#x27;s ten children and the only child of her marriage to Frank Robinson. His parents divorced when he was an infant, and his mother moved with her children to Alameda, California, and then to the West Oakland neighborhood of nearby Oakland. He attended McClymonds High School in Oakland where he was a basketball teammate of Bill Russell. He was a baseball teammate of Vada Pinson and Curt Flood. He also played American Legion Baseball.

==Playing career==
===Minor leagues===
In 1953, Bobby Mattick, a scout for the Cincinnati Reds, signed Robinson to a contract worth $3,500 ($ in current dollar terms). He made his professional debut for the Ogden Reds of the Class C Pioneer League. He batted .348 with 17 home runs and 83 runs batted in (RBI) in 72 games played. He was promoted to the Tulsa Oilers of the Class AA Texas League in 1954, but was demoted to the Columbia Reds of the Class A South Atlantic League. He returned to Columbia in 1955.

===Major Leagues===
====Cincinnati Redlegs / Reds (1956–1965)====
Robinson made his major league debut on April 17, 1956 at the age of 20. After posting 11 consecutive losing seasons, the Reds surprised their opposition by jumping to first place at the mid-point of the 1956 season. Robinson led the team with 18 home runs at mid-season, earning him the role as starting left fielder for the National League in the 1956 All-Star Game. The Reds stayed in the pennant race until the last day of the season, ending up with a 91–63 record, two games behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Robinson ended the 1956 season with a .290 batting average and 83 RBI, and his 38 home runs tied the Major League Baseball record for home runs hit by a Rookie player previously set by Wally Berger in . His rookie home run record stood for 31 years when it was broken by Mark McGwire&#x27;s 49 home runs in . His impressive power hitting display earned him the National League Rookie of the Year Award.

In 1957, the Reds were once again in first place at mid-season when, Robinson and six of his Redleg teammates—Ed Bailey, Johnny Temple, Don Hoak, Gus Bell, Wally Post and Roy McMillan—were voted into the National League starting lineup for the 1957 All-Star Game. An investigation launched by Commissioner Ford C. Frick found that the majority of the ballots cast had come from Cincinnati as the result of a ballot stuffing campaign by Reds fans.

Frick allowed Robinson to remain on the team while Bell and Post were replaced on the NL starting roster by outfielders Hank Aaron and Willie Mays. Bell remained as a reserve player, but Post was removed from the roster altogether. Subsequently, Frick suspended fans&#x27; All-Star game voting rights until they were eventually restored in 1970. The Reds faltered after the All-Star break and dropped to fourth place in the season final standings.

Robinson earned the 1957 &quot;Associated Press&quot; National League Sophomore-of-the-Year award by improving his batting average to .322, tying him with Hank Aaron for third place in the 1957 NL batting championship race behind future Hall of Fame members Stan Musial (.366) and Willie Mays (.333). He credited manager, Birdie Tebbetts for his performance saying, &quot;He kept after me all year and that&#x27;s what a young ball player needs.&quot; In 1958, Robinson would win the only Gold Glove Award of his career however, his batting average dropped to .269 as the Reds fell to last place in the National League, prompting Tebbetts to announce his resignation on August 14. In 1959, Robinson improved to a .311 batting average along with 36 home runs and 125 RBI in 146 games. He also enjoyed a productive 1960, batting .297 with 31 home runs and 83 RBI in 139 games. That year, Robinson led the major leagues in slugging percentage (.595) and on-base plus slugging (1.002), and also ranked first in the NL in hit by pitches (nine).

In 1961, Robinson moved to right field and produced another strong offensive season. In July he batted .409, hit 13 home runs, and drove in 34 runs to win NL Player of the Month Award, and finished the season with a .323 batting average with 37 home runs and 124 RBI in 153 games, helping to propel the Reds to the National League pennant. His performance earned him the 1961 National League Most Valuable Player Award. In the 1961 World Series against the New York Yankees, Robinson had a lackluster performance, producing only three hits as the Reds fell to the Yankees in five games.

Robinson hit a career-high .342 in 1962, just four points behind the NL batting champion, Tommy Davis. He also led the league in runs scored (134), doubles (51), on-base percentage (.421), slugging percentage (.624) and on-base plus slugging (1.045). Robinson&#x27;s season totals for runs scored, doubles, RBI (136) and on-base percentage were also career-highs.

Robinson was noted as a fiercely aggressive player. He spiked Johnny Logan in 1957, causing Logan to miss six weeks. In a game against the Milwaukee Braves on August 15, 1960, Robinson slid hard into third base, prompting a fistfight with Milwaukee&#x27;s future Hall of Fame third baseman, Eddie Mathews.

====Baltimore Orioles (1966–1971)====
On December 9, 1965, Reds owner Bill DeWitt traded Robinson to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for pitcher Milt Pappas, pitcher Jack Baldschun, and outfielder Dick Simpson. The trade turned out to be very lopsided. DeWitt, who had a slew of successful trades including his time as general manager in Detroit and the early 1960s rebuilding the Reds, famously referred to Robinson as &quot;not a young 30&quot; after the trade. The Reds led the NL in offense in 1965 and needed pitching. Pappas, who was a consistent performer in Baltimore was a major disappointment in Cincinnati while Robinson had continued success in Baltimore. In Robinson&#x27;s first year in Baltimore, he won the Triple Crown, leading the American League with a .316 batting average (then the lowest ever by a Triple Crown winner), 49 home runs (the most ever by a right-handed Triple crown winner) and 122 RBI in 155 games. On May 8, 1966, Robinson became the only player ever to hit a home run completely out of Memorial Stadium. The shot came off of Luis Tiant in the second game of a doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians, and the home run measured . Until the Orioles&#x27; move to Camden Yards in 1992, a flag labeled &quot;HERE&quot; was flown at the spot where the ball left the stadium.

The Orioles won the 1966 World Series, and Robinson was named World Series Most Valuable Player. In the Orioles&#x27; four-game sweep of the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers, Robinson hit two home runs—one in Game 1 (which Baltimore won 5–2), and one in Game 4 (the only run of the game in a 1–0 series-clinching victory). Robinson hit both home runs off of Don Drysdale.

During the 1969 season, Robinson brought some humor to the Orioles&#x27; clubhouse by presiding over their kangaroo court, held after every Oriole win. As the judge, he would hear arguments from both sides and give out fines for minor infractions (such as one dollar per lady talked to during a game) and &quot;awards&quot;, named after people notoriously bad at a certain skill and involving a prop the &quot;winner&quot; had to display until the next court session. For instance, Jim Palmer once won the John Mason Baserunning Award, a smelly, decrepit baseball cleat presented for baserunning gaffes. Palmer credited the kangaroo court for helping the Orioles bond as a team.

On June 26, 1970, Robinson hit back-to-back grand slams in the fifth and sixth innings in the Orioles&#x27; 12–2 victory over the Washington Senators. The same runners were on base both times: Dave McNally was on third base, Don Buford was on second, and Paul Blair was on first.

The Orioles won three consecutive American League pennants between 1969 and 1971. Before the 1969 World Series, Robinson said, &quot;Bring on the Mets and Ron Gaspar!&quot; He was told by his teammate Merv Rettenmund, &quot;It&#x27;s Rod, stupid.&quot; He then retorted by saying, &quot;OK. Bring on Rod Stupid!&quot; Baltimore won the 1970 World Series over the Reds.

====Final years as a player (1972–1976)====

Robinson was traded along with Pete Richert from the Orioles to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Doyle Alexander, Bob O&#x27;Brien, Sergio Robles and Royle Stillman at the Winter Meetings on December 2, 1971. When the 1972 Major League Baseball strike occurred, Robinson was one of three Dodgers out of thirty who voted against it. When the vote was announced, he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in the strike, and I voted against it. But I was voted down, so now I&#x27;m on your side. I&#x27;m with you guys.&quot; The 1972 season was his first season in the National League since playing with the 1965 Reds. He played 103 games while compiling a .251 batting average, 59 RBI, 86 hits, and 19 home runs. Teammate Tommy John said, &quot;Frank didn&#x27;t have a great year in 1972, but he played hard all year...He set a positive role model for the team.&quot;

Robinson&#x27;s only season with the Dodgers ended when he was dealt along with Bill Singer, Bobby Valentine, Billy Grabarkewitz and Mike Strahler to the California Angels for Andy Messersmith and Ken McMullen at the Winter Meetings on November 28, 1972. The transaction was the result of Robinson&#x27;s request for regular playing time, something Dodgers general manager Al Campanis wanted for the team&#x27;s younger prospects. It also reunited him with Angels general manager Harry Dalton who had worked in a similar capacity when both were with the Orioles. In his time with the Angels, he became their first designated hitter while also being teammates again with Vada Pinson. He played 147 games in 1973 and 129 in 1974. In his tenure with the Angels, he hit for a .259 average while posting 50 home runs, 249 hits, and 160 RBI in 276 games.

On September 12, 1974, the Angels traded Robinson to the Cleveland Indians for Ken Suarez, cash and a player to be named later (Rusty Torres). Three weeks later, the Indians named him their manager and persuaded him to continue playing. In his first at-bat as a player/manager for Cleveland in 1975, he hit a home run off of Doc Medich of the Yankees. He injured his shoulder in 1975 and did not play often. He retired from playing after the 1976 season, after batting .226 with 14 home runs in 235 at-bats for Cleveland from 1974 through 1976. His final at-bat in the majors came against Baltimore on September 18, where he pinch-hit in the eighth inning and collected an RBI base hit in a 3–2 loss.

===Career statistics===
During a 21-year baseball career, he batted .294 with 586 home runs, 1,812 runs batted in, and 2,943 hits. At his retirement, his 586 career home runs were the fourth most in history (behind only the records of Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays). He is third on Cincinnati&#x27;s all-time home run leaders list (324, behind Johnny Bench and Joey Votto) and is the Reds&#x27; all-time leader in slugging percentage (.554).

In his career, Robinson held several major league records. In his rookie season, he tied Wally Berger&#x27;s record for home runs by a rookie (38). (The current record would be set by Pete Alonso in 2019.) Robinson still holds the record for home runs on Opening Day (8), which includes a home run in his first at bat as a player-manager.

Robinson won the 1966 American League Triple Crown (.316 batting average, 49 home runs, 122 RBI). Only two players (Carl Yastrzemski and Miguel Cabrera) have since won the award in either league and the two MVP awards, which made him the first player in baseball history to earn the title in both leagues.

==Manager==

===Managing career===
Robinson managed in the winter leagues late in his playing career. By the early 1970s, he had his heart set on becoming the first black manager in the majors; the Angels traded him to the Cleveland Indians midway through the 1974 season due to his open campaigning for the manager&#x27;s job. He was appointed player-manager by the Indians on October 2, 1974, giving him the distinction of being the first black manager in the Majors. Robinson had a rocky time in Cleveland, as general manager Phil Seghi generally liked to second guess his manager along with trying to push for him to play alongside managing (the result was that he played roughly 80 games as manager). Disagreements with players such as Gaylord Perry did not help matters (he went to the press saying he wanted to be paid a dollar more than Robinson&#x27;s $173,500 salary). The Indians had a 79–80 record, and had an 81–78 record in 1976, their first winning record in eight years. Cleveland started the 1977 season 26–31 and fired Robinson on June 19, 1977.

Robinson managed the San Francisco Giants from 1981 through 106 games of the 1984 season, when he was fired. He finished the 1984 season as the hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers on a contract worth $1. In 1985, he joined the Orioles&#x27; front office. On April 12, 1988, Robinson was named manager of the Orioles, replacing Cal Ripken Sr. after an 0–6 start to the season. He was awarded the American League Manager of the Year Award in 1989 for leading the Orioles to an 87–75 record, a turnaround from their previous season in which they went 54–107, and the division title came down to the final three-game series between Baltimore and the Toronto Blue Jays, but the Jays would win the first two games to clinch the division. It would be the closest Robinson ever came to managing a team to the postseason.
Robinson was fired by the Orioles in May 1991. After he had spent some years known in baseball as the Director of Discipline, Robinson was chosen by Major League Baseball to manage the Montreal Expos in February 2002, which MLB owned at that time. The Expos, who had losing records in the five previous seasons, finished the 2002 and 2003 seasons with 83–79 records. The Expos then next slumped to a 67–95 record in 2004, their final season before relocation to Washington, D.C.

In a June 2005 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; poll of 450 MLB players, Robinson was selected as the worst manager in baseball, along with Buck Showalter, then manager of the Texas Rangers. In the August 2006 poll, he again was voted worst manager with 17% of the vote and 37.7% of the NL East vote.

On April 20, 2006, with the Nationals&#x27; 10–4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, Robinson got his 1,000th win, becoming the 53rd manager to reach that milestone. He had earned his 1,000th loss two seasons earlier.

During a game against the Houston Astros on May 25, 2006, Robinson pulled Nationals catcher Matt LeCroy during the middle of the seventh inning, violating an unwritten rule that managers do not remove position players in the middle of an inning. Instead, managers are supposed to discreetly switch position players in between innings. However, LeCroy, the third-string catcher, had allowed Astros baserunners to steal seven bases over seven innings and had committed two throwing errors. Although the Nationals won the game 8–5, Robinson found the decision so difficult to make on a player he respected so much, he broke down crying during post-game interviews.

On September 30, 2006, the Nationals&#x27; management declined to renew Robinson&#x27;s contract for the 2007 season, though they stated he was welcome to come to spring training in an unspecified role. Robinson, who wanted either a front office job or a consultancy, declined. On October 1, 2006, he managed his final game, a 6–2 loss to the Mets, and prior to the game addressed the fans at RFK Stadium. Robinson&#x27;s record as a manager stood at 1,065 wins and 1,176 losses. He is one of just seven managers to have won 1,000 games without having made the postseason once, and he is the only one to do it since the Expansion Era began in 1961 (incidentally, five of those managers won pennants in the 19th century, while the sixth was Jimmy Dykes who retired as a manager in 1961).

===Managerial record===

==Honors==

In addition to his two Most Valuable Player awards (1961 and 1966) and his World Series Most Valuable Player award (1966), Robinson was honored in 1966 with the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year in any sport.

In 1982, Robinson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a Baltimore Oriole. Robinson is also a charter member of the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame (along with Brooks Robinson), and a member of the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame, being inducted into both in 1978. He was named to the Washington Nationals Ring of Honor for his &quot;significant contribution to the game of baseball in Washington, D.C.&quot; on May 9, 2015. He was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame in 2016. The Reds, Orioles, and Indians have retired his uniform number 20. He is one of only two major-league players, the other being Nolan Ryan, to have his number retired by three different organizations.

In 1999, Robinson ranked 22nd on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. He was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Robinson at number 20 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

Three teams have honored Robinson with statues: 
*In 2003, the Reds dedicated a bronze statue of Robinson at Great American Ball Park.
*In 2012, the Orioles unveiled a bronze statue of Robinson at Oriole Park at Camden Yards as part of the Orioles Legends Celebration Series.
*In 2017, the Indians unveiled a bronze statue of Robinson in front of Progressive Field.

===Awards===

President George W. Bush awarded Robinson the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 9, 2005.

The citation on the award read:

On April 13, 2007, Robinson was awarded the first Jackie Robinson Society Community Recognition Award at George Washington University.

==Front office and media career==

Robinson served as an assistant general manager for the Orioles through 1995 when he was fired. He worked for MLB as vice president of on-field operations from 1999 to 2002. He was responsible for player discipline, uniform policy, stadium configuration, and other on-field issues.

Robinson served as an analyst for ESPN during spring training in 2007. The Nationals offered to honor Robinson during a May 20 game against his former club, the Baltimore Orioles, but he refused.

In 2007 Robinson rejoined the MLB front office serving as a special advisor for baseball operations from 2007 to 2009. He then served as special assistant to Bud Selig from 2009 to 2010 and was named senior vice president for major league operations from 2010 to 2011. In June 2012, he became executive vice president of baseball development. In February 2015, Robinson left that position and was named senior advisor to the Commissioner of Baseball and honorary American League president.

==Personal life==
While playing for the Reds in the late 1950s, Robinson attended Xavier University in Cincinnati during the off-season. While in Baltimore, he became active in the civil rights movement. He originally declined membership in the NAACP unless the organization promised not to make him do public appearances. However, after witnessing Baltimore&#x27;s segregated housing and discriminatory real estate practices, he reconsidered and became an enthusiastic speaker on racial issues.

On February 9, 1961, Robinson pulled a .25 caliber pistol during an argument in a Cincinnati restaurant. He pleaded guilty on March 20 to a charge of carrying a concealed weapon and was sentenced to pay a $250 fine ().

Robinson met Barbara Ann Cole in 1961; they married that year and lived in Los Angeles where Barbara sold real estate. They had two children. In 2003, he guest starred on an episode of &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; as himself, along with Ernie Banks and Johnny Bench.

On February 7, 2019, Robinson died of bone cancer in Los Angeles at the age of 83.

<doc id="43498" wikidata="Q12858131" url="?curid=43498" title="Dord">
<text>The word dord is a dictionary error in lexicography. It was accidentally created, as a ghost word, by the staff of G. and C. Merriam Company (now part of Merriam-Webster) in the &quot;New International Dictionary&quot;, second edition (1934). That dictionary defined the term as a synonym for density used in physics and chemistry in the following way:
dord (dôrd), &quot;n. Physics &amp; Chem.&quot; Density.

Philip Babcock Gove, an editor at Merriam-Webster who became editor-in-chief of &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot;, wrote a letter to the journal &quot;American Speech&quot;, fifteen years after the error was caught, in which he explained how the &quot;dord&quot; error was introduced and corrected.

On 31 July 1931, Austin M. Patterson, the dictionary&#x27;s chemistry editor, sent in a slip reading &quot;D or d, cont./density.&quot; This was intended to add &quot;density&quot; to the existing list of words that the letter &quot;D&quot; can abbreviate. The phrase &quot;D or d&quot; was misinterpreted as a single, word: &quot;Dord&quot;. This was a plausible mistake because headwords on slips were typed with spaces between the letters, so &quot;D or d&quot; looked very much like &quot;D o r d&quot;. The original slip went missing, so a new slip was prepared for the printer, which assigned a part of speech (noun) and a pronunciation. The would-be word was not questioned or corrected by proofreaders. The entry appeared on page 771 of the dictionary around 1934, between the entries for &quot;Dorcopsis&quot; (a type of small kangaroo) and doré (golden in color).

On 28 February 1939, an editor noticed &quot;dord&quot; lacked an etymology and investigated, discovering the error. An order was sent to the printer marked &quot;plate change/imperative/urgent&quot;. The non-word &quot;dord&quot; was excised; &quot;density&quot; was added as an additional meaning for the abbreviation &quot;D or d&quot; as originally intended, and the definition of the adjacent entry &quot;Doré furnace&quot; was expanded from &quot;A furnace for refining Doré bullion&quot; to &quot;a furnace in which Doré bullion is refined&quot; to close up the space. Gove wrote that this was &quot;probably too bad, for why shouldn&#x27;t &quot;dord&quot; mean &#x27;density&#x27;?&quot; In 1940, bound books began appearing without the ghost word, although inspection of printed copies well into the 1940s shows &quot;dord&quot; still present. The entry &quot;dord&quot; was not completely removed until 1947.

<doc id="43500" wikidata="Q63392517" url="?curid=43500" title="Ganja">
<text>Ganja (, ; ) is one of the oldest and most commonly used synonyms for cannabis. Its usage in English dates to before 1689.

==Etymology==

&quot;Ganja&quot; is borrowed from Hindi (, IPA: ), a name for cannabis in the Indo-Aryan language that descended from an early form of Vedic Sanskrit. The Sanskrit refers to a &quot;powerful preparation from &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot;&quot;. But the word only refers to a certain product derived from cannabis plants. &quot;Gāñjā&quot; is the title given to the flowers, whereas “&quot;charas&quot;” refers to the resin, and “&quot;bhang&quot;” the seeds and leaves.

The word ganja reached the Western world through victims of slavery. Victims of the Atlantic slave trade were brought from Africa to Jamaica in 1513. In 1845, the British Empire started to call for indentured Indians to come to the Caribbean to strengthen the workforce on sugar plantations. They brought with them elements of their culture, including ganja.

One academic source places the date of introduction of ganja in Jamaica at 1845. The term came with 19th century workers whose descendants are now known as Indo-Jamaicans. 

The word was used in Europe as early as 1856, when the British enacted a tax on the &quot;ganja&quot; trade.

In 1913, Jamaica banned cannabis with the Ganja Law.

==Contemporary use of the term &quot;ganja&quot;==

===English use===
&quot;Ganja&quot; is the most common term for marijuana in West Indies.

=== In popular culture ===
Cultural figureheads such as Bob Marley popularized Rastafari and ganja through reggae music. In 1976, Peter Tosh defended the use of ganja in the song &quot;Legalize It&quot;. The hip hop group Cypress Hill revived the term in the United States in 2004 in a song titled &quot;Ganja Bus&quot;, followed by other artists, including rapper Eminem, in the 2009 song &quot;Must Be the Ganja&quot;.

==In other languages==
Derivatives of the term are used as generic words for marijuana in several languages, such as Indonesian/Malay (), Khmer (, ), Lao (, ), Thai (, ), Tiwi (), and Vietnamese ().

<doc id="43501" wikidata="Q76749" url="?curid=43501" title="Edith Stein">
<text>Edith Stein (; ; in religion Teresa Benedicta of the Cross; 12 October 1891 – 9 August 1942) was a German philosopher who converted to Catholicism and became a Discalced Carmelite nun. Edith Stein was murdered in the gas chamber at the concentration camp Auschwitz II-Birkenau on 9 August 1942, and is canonized as a martyr and saint of the Catholic Church; she is also one of six patron saints of Europe.

Stein was born into an observant German Jewish family, but had become an agnostic by her teenage years. Moved by the tragedies of World War I, in 1915, she took lessons to become a nursing assistant and worked in an infectious diseases hospital. After completing her doctoral thesis at the University of Freiburg in 1916, she obtained an assistantship there to Edmund Husserl.

From reading the life of the reformer of the Carmelites, Teresa of Ávila, Stein was drawn to the Christian faith. She was baptized on 1 January 1922 into the Catholic Church. At that point, she wanted to become a Discalced Carmelite nun but was dissuaded by her spiritual mentor, the archabbot of Beuron, Raphael Walzer OSB. She then taught at a Jewish school of education in Speyer. As a result of the requirement of an &quot;Aryan certificate&quot; for civil servants promulgated by the Nazi government in April 1933 as part of its Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, she had to quit her teaching position.
Edith Stein was admitted as a student to the study of religion to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in Cologne on 25 November, on the first vespers of the feast of Saint Teresa of Ávila, and received the religious habit as a novice in April 1934, taking the religious name &quot;Teresia Benedicta a Cruce&quot; (Teresia in remembrance of Teresa of Ávila, Benedicta in honour of Benedict of Nursia). She made her temporary vows on 21 April 1935, and her perpetual vows on 21 April 1938.

The same year, Teresa Benedicta a Cruce and her biological sister Rosa, by then also a convert and an extern (tertiary of the order, who would handle the community&#x27;s needs outside the monastery), were sent to the Carmelite monastery in Echt, Netherlands, for their safety. In response to the pastoral letter from the Dutch bishops on 26 July 1942, in which they made the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis a central theme, all baptized Catholics of Jewish origin (according to police reports, 244 people) were arrested by the Gestapo on the following Sunday, 2 August 1942. They were sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, and were murdered in the Birkenau gas chambers on 9 August 1942.

==Early life==

Edith Stein was born in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), Lower Silesia, into an observant Jewish family. She was the youngest of 11 children and was born on Yom Kippur, that important Jewish festival of the Hebrew calendar; these facts combined to make her a favorite of her mother. She was a very gifted child who enjoyed learning, in a home where her mother encouraged critical thinking, and she greatly admired her mother&#x27;s unwavering religious faith. By her teenage years, however, Stein had become an agnostic.

Though her father died while she was young, her widowed mother was determined to give her children a thorough education and consequently sent Edith to study at the Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Breslau. At age 19, Stein moved with her family to Breslau to a house bought by her mother, which she later described in her &quot;Autobiography&quot;. Today, Edith Stein House hosts a museum dedicated to the history of the Stein family.

==Academic career==
In April 1913, Stein arrived at the University of Göttingen in order to study for the summer semester with Edmund Husserl. By the end of the summer, she had decided to pursue her doctoral degree in philosophy under Husserl and chose empathy as her thesis topic. Her studies were interrupted in July 1914 because of the outbreak of World War I. She then served as a volunteer wartime Red Cross nurse in an uninfectious diseases hospital at Mährisch Weißkirchen from 7 April to 1 September 1915. In 1916, Stein moved to the University of Freiburg in order to complete her dissertation on Empathy. Shortly before receiving her degree from Freiburg she agreed to become Husserl&#x27;s assistant there. In this role, she differed with Husserl on important issues and made dependent contributions to phenomenology as a whole. Her dissertation entitled &quot;Das Einfühlungsproblem in seiner historischen Entwicklung und in phänomenologischer Betrachtung&quot; (&quot;The Empathy Problem as it Developed Historically and Considered Phenomenologically&quot;) was awarded a doctorate in philosophy with the &quot;summa cum laude&quot; honor. Stein then became a member of the faculty at Freiburg, where she worked until 1918 as a teaching assistant to Husserl, who had transferred to that institution. The University of Göttingen rejected her habilitation thesis in 1919. Although Stein passed her doctoral examination with distinction, her attempts to habilitate failed due to the fact that Stein was a woman.

Her rejected habilitation thesis, &quot;Beiträge zur philosophischen Begründung der Psychologie und der Geisteswissenschaften&quot; (&quot;Contributions to the Philosophical Foundations of Psychology and the Human Sciences&quot;), was published in the &quot;Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische Forschung&quot; in 1922. She is categorized as a realistic phenomenologist.

While Stein had earlier contacts with Catholicism, it was her reading of the autobiography of the mystic Teresa of Ávila during summer holidays in Bad Bergzabern in 1921 that prompted her conversion and eventually the desire to seek the life of a Discalced Carmelite. Baptized on 1 January 1922, and dissuaded by her spiritual advisers from immediately seeking entry to the enclosed and hidden life of a Carmelite nun, Stein obtained a position to teach at the Dominican nuns&#x27; school in Speyer from 1923 to 1931. While there, Stein translated Thomas Aquinas&#x27; &quot;De Veritate&quot; (&quot;Of Truth&quot;) into German, familiarized herself with Catholic philosophy in general and tried to bridge the phenomenology of her former teacher, Husserl, to Thomism. She visited Husserl and Heidegger at Freiburg in April 1929, the same month that Heidegger gave a speech to Husserl on his 70th birthday. In 1932 she became a lecturer at the Catholic Church-affiliated Institute for Scientific Pedagogy in Münster, but antisemitic legislation passed by the Nazi government forced her to resign the post in 1933. In a letter to Pope Pius XI, she denounced the Nazi regime and asked the Pope to openly denounce the regime &quot;to put a stop to this abuse of Christ&#x27;s name.&quot;

Her letter received no answer, and it is not known for certain whether the Pope ever saw it. However, in 1937 the Pope issued an encyclical written in German, &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; (according to its German first words, lit. &quot;With deep anxiety&quot;), in which he criticized Nazism, listed violations of the Concordat between Germany and the Church of 1933, and condemned antisemitism.

==Discalced Carmelite nun and martyr==
Stein entered the Discalced Carmelite monastery St. Maria vom Frieden (Our Lady of Peace) in Cologne-Lindenthal in October 1933 and took the religious name &quot;Teresia Benedicta a Cruce&quot; (Teresa Benedicta of the Cross). In Cologne she wrote her metaphysical book &quot;Endliches und ewiges Sein&quot; (&quot;Finite and Eternal Being&quot;), which attempted to combine the philosophies of Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus and Husserl.

To avoid the growing Nazi threat, the order transferred Edith and her sister, Rosa, who was also a convert and an extern sister of the Carmel, to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in Echt, Netherlands. There she wrote &quot;Studie über Joannes a Cruce: Kreuzeswissenschaft&quot; (&quot;Studies on John of the Cross: The Science of the Cross&quot;). In her testament of 9 June 1939 she wrote: 

Stein&#x27;s move to Echt prompted her to be more devout and even more observant of the Carmelite rule. After having her teaching position revoked by the implementation of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, Stein quickly eased back into the role of instructor at the convent in Echt, teaching both fellow sisters and students within the community Latin and philosophy.

Even prior to the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Stein believed she would not survive the war, going so far as to write to the prioress to request her permission to &quot;allow [Stein] to offer [her]self to the heart of Jesus as a sacrifice of atonement for true peace&quot; and made a will. Her fellow sisters would later recount how Stein began &quot;quietly training herself for life in a concentration camp, by enduring cold and hunger&quot; after the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940.

Ultimately, she would not be safe in the Netherlands. The Dutch Bishops&#x27; Conference had a public statement read in all churches across the nation on 20 July 1942 condemning Nazi racism. In a retaliatory response on 26 July 1942 the Reichskommissar of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, ordered the arrest of all Jewish converts who had previously been spared. Along with two hundred and forty-three baptized Jews living in the Netherlands Teresa Benedicta a Cruce was arrested by the SS on 2 August 1942. She and her sister Rosa were imprisoned at the concentration camps of Amersfoort and Westerbork before being deported to Auschwitz. A Dutch official at Westerbork was so impressed by her sense of faith and calm he offered her an escape plan. Stein vehemently refused his assistance, stating: &quot;If somebody intervened at this point and took away [her] chance to share in the fate of [her] brothers and sisters, that would be utter annihilation.&quot;

On 7 August 1942, early in the morning, 987 Jews were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. It was probably on 9 August that Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, her sister Rosa, and many more Jewish people were killed in a gas chamber at Birkenau.

==Philosophy==

Stein&#x27;s development as a philosopher is frequently divided into three periods: an early, phenomenological (1916–25), a middle, comparative (1925–33) and a late, Christian (1935–42). In reality the same factors work themselves out throughout her work and propels it forward: 1. a profound understanding of and commitment to the phenomenological method as taught by Husserl and Reinach; 2. a deep sense of responsibility to the other for what we believe and 3. an acceptance of my own inability to form a complete, meaningful worldview without divine assistance. The three periods are best understood as stages of integration of these three factors, with Stein&#x27;s baptism New Year&#x27;s Day 1922, marking a decisive step on the way and her entering Carmel 14 October 1933 marking another.

=== The early phenomenological period (1916–25) ===
Stein&#x27;s dissertation on empathy was according to her own account an attempt to fill a gap in Husserl&#x27;s work. In her autobiographical &quot;Life in a Jewish Family&quot;, she recalled that he took empathy to be the crucial act in which intersubjectivity was established, but nowhere detailed exactly what was meant by it. She therefore wanted to undertake this task and thereby clarify this crucial idea for the development of the phenomenological movement. While working as Husserl&#x27;s assistant (1916–18) she edited Husserl&#x27;s manuscripts of what was later to be published as &quot;Ideas II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;, and in the process came to understand the extraordinary importance this act has for our constitution of the intersubjective world, and in particular for the objects studied by psychology and the humanities. When she resigned from her position as Husserl&#x27;s assistant, the first work she undertook was on the phenomenological constitution of those objects: the psyche and the spirit. The result was the two treatises of &quot;Philosophy of Psychology and the Humanities&quot;, published in Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Jahrbuch&quot; 1922: &quot;Psychic Causality&quot; and &quot;Individual and Community&quot;. From this period also dates &quot;Introduction to Philosophy,&quot; &quot;An Investigation Concerning the State,&quot; and very importantly &quot;Freedom and Grace&quot;.

=== The middle comparative period (1925–33) ===
Encouraged to study and compare Thomas Aquinas&#x27; philosophy with that of the phenomenological movement, Stein embarked on a translation project of Aquinas&#x27; &quot;De Veritate&quot;, which was to be published in two volumes in 1932. The work, which translates Aquinas&#x27; way of thinking into a modern German idiom and restyles it as a contemporary academic treatise, occasioned that Stein engaged with Aquinas&#x27; thought as a phenomenologist, i.e. as someone interested in the matters discussed by Aquinas, as distinct from providing an interpretation of Aquinas&#x27; thought or writing in prolongation of it as a thomist. The most important works from this period are &#x27;Husserl and Aquinas: A Comparison&#x27;, in which she discusses the differing methodologies of Husserl and Aquinas and accounts for their differences, &quot;Potency and Act&quot;, in which she attempts a phenomenological investigation of &#x27;potency&#x27; and &#x27;act&#x27; and the twin work of anthropology: The &quot;Structure of the Human Person&quot;. &quot;Philosophical Anthropology&quot; and &quot;What is the Human Being?&quot; &quot;Theological Anthropology&quot; (the second volume remains a highly developed draft rather than a completed work, since Stein&#x27;s lectures were canceled in 1933). During this period she also lectures on women&#x27;s education and vocation and on education in general to very large audiences and to great acclaim. In these lectures, published in ESGA 13 and ESGA 16, she works out for herself the important questions concerning social type and essence, which find a fuller development in &quot;The Structure of the Human Person&quot;.

=== The later Christian period (1934–42) ===
Her first literal assignment in Carmel was to prepare &quot;Potency and Act&quot; for publication, a task she accomplished by writing a new book: &quot;Finite and Eternal Being – An Ascent to the Meaning of Being&quot;. This work proposed a phenomenological doctrine of being &quot;(Seinslehre)&quot;, which knows itself to be Christian, i.e. as taking Christian Revelation to contribute towards the view of the world in which it looks for and finds the meaning of being in being&#x27;s unfolding. Stein also worked on Dionysius the Areopagite, translating his works into German and writing (for him) a work supposed to be lost on symbolic theology. Stein&#x27;s final work, the &quot;Science of the Cross&quot;, was a commentary on John of the Cross, which developed the specifically Carmelite understanding of the depths of the soul, already of interest to Stein in her early work.

==Legacy and veneration==


Teresa Benedicta of the Cross was beatified as a martyr on 1 May 1987 in Cologne, Germany, by Pope John Paul II and then canonized by him 11 years later on 11 October 1998 in Rome. The miracle that was the basis for her canonization is the cure of Benedicta McCarthy, a little girl who had swallowed a large amount of paracetamol (acetaminophen), which causes hepatic necrosis. The young girl&#x27;s father, Emmanuel Charles McCarthy, a priest of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, immediately called together relatives and prayed for Teresa&#x27;s intercession. Shortly thereafter, the nurses in the intensive care unit saw her sit up, completely healthy. Ronald Kleinman, a pediatric specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who treated the girl, testified about her recovery to church tribunals, stating: &quot;I was willing to say that it was miraculous.&quot; McCarthy would later attend Sr. Teresa Benedicta&#x27;s canonization.

Teresa Benedicta of the Cross is one of the six patron saints of Europe, together with Benedict of Nursia, Cyril and Methodius, Bridget of Sweden, and Catherine of Siena.

Today there are many schools named in tribute to her, for example in her hometown, Lubliniec, Poland Darmstadt, Germany, Hengelo, Netherlands, and Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Also named for her are a women&#x27;s dormitory at the University of Tübingen and a classroom building at The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.

Lubliniec in Poland hosts the Edith Stein Museum (Muzeum Pro Memoria Edith Stein) localised on the first floor of the Courant family house (Edith Stein&#x27;s grandparents&#x27; family home). Wrocław hosts a museum called Edith Stein House localised in the house Edith&#x27;s mother bought for the family in 1919 on the street then called Michaelisstrasse 38 (today Nowowiejska 38).

In Vienna, the Edith-Stein-Haus at Ebendorferstraße 8 is the main location of the Catholic University Chaplaincy and the university pastoral care of the Archdiocese of Vienna. In the spirit of Karl Strobl&#x27;s model of the &quot;Catholic Student House&quot;, the house is also home to a chapel consecrated to Edith Stein as well as a dormitory for about 90 students.

The philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre published a book in 2006 titled &quot;Edith Stein: A Philosophical Prologue, 1913–1922&quot;, in which he contrasted her living of her own personal philosophy with Martin Heidegger, whose actions during the Nazi era, according to MacIntyre, suggested a &quot;bifurcation of personality.&quot;

Playwright Arthur Giron wrote &quot;Edith Stein&quot;, a play that was inspired by Stein&#x27;s life. It was produced at the Pittsburgh Public Theater in 1988.

In 1988, Edith Stein was pictured on a German postage stamp with Rupert Mayer SJ in honor of their beatification.

In 1991, the Italian musician Juri Camisasca released a song inspired by the life of Edith Stein, &quot;Il carmelo di Echt&quot; (The carmelite convent of Echt) on the album of the same name. The song was later recorded by Giuni Russo and Franco Battiato.

In 1995, Hungarian film director Márta Mészáros made a movie about the life and death of Edith Stein with the title &quot;A hetedik szoba&quot; (The Seventh Room/Chamber), starring Maia Morgenstern.

In 1999, a memorial statue by German sculptor Bert Gerresheim was dedicated in Cologne, Germany. The statue comprises three different views of Stein reflecting her Jewish and Christian faith, and a pile of empty shoes representing the victims of the holocaust.

In 2007, Stein&#x27;s life and work was dramatised in the novel &quot;Winter Under Water&quot; (Picador, London) by author James Hopkin.

In 2008, the first &quot;Stolperstein&quot; () that was ever laid in Poland was placed near Edith Stein&#x27;s childhood home at 38 ul. Nowowiejska (formerly the Michaelisstraße) in Wrocław. Other &quot;Stolpersteine&quot; for her are in Cologne (several) and Freiburg.

In 2009, her bust was installed at the Walhalla Memorial near Regensburg, Germany. In June 2009, the International Association for the Study of the Philosophy of Edith Stein (IASPES) was founded, and held its first international conference at Maynooth University, Ireland, in order to advance the philosophical writings of Stein.

On 6 June 2014, the 70th anniversary of D-Day, a bell dedicated to her was named by Prince Charles at Bayeux Cathedral.

Also in 2014, the book &quot;Edith Stein and Regina Jonas: Religious Visionaries in the Time of the Death Camps&quot;, by Emily Leah Silverman, was published.

In 2018, American film director Joshua Sinclair made a movie about the life and death of Edith Stein with the title &quot;A Rose in Winter&quot;, starring Zana Marjanovic.

In April 2024, during a private audience Pope Francis received a formal request from the superior general of the Discalced Carmelites, Miguel Márquez Calle, to declare Stein a Doctor of the Church. The Discalced Carmelites first launched an international commission to gather the necessary documentation required for the declaration in 2022, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Stein&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism and the 80th anniversary of her martyrdom.

==Controversy as to the cause of her murder==
The beatification of Teresa Benedicta as a martyr generated criticism. Critics argued that she was murdered because she was Jewish by birth, rather than for her Christian faith, and that, in the words of Daniel Polish, the beatification seemed to &quot;carry the tacit message encouraging conversionary activities&quot; because &quot;official discussion of the beatification seemed to make a point of conjoining Stein&#x27;s Catholic faith with her death with &#x27;fellow Jews&#x27; in Auschwitz.&quot; The position of the Catholic Church is that Teresa Benedicta also died because of the Dutch episcopacy&#x27;s public condemnation of Nazi racism in 1942; in other words, that she died because of the moral teaching of the Church and is thus a true martyr.

<text>Henry Ross Perot Sr. ( ; June 27, 1930 – July 9, 2019) was an American businessman, politician, and philanthropist. He was the founder and chief executive officer of Electronic Data Systems and Perot Systems. He ran an independent campaign in the 1992 U.S. presidential election and a third-party campaign in the 1996 U.S. presidential election as the nominee of the Reform Party, which was formed by grassroots supporters of Perot&#x27;s 1992 campaign. Although he failed to carry a single state in either election, both campaigns were among the strongest presidential showings by a third party or independent candidate in U.S. history.

Born and raised in Texarkana, Texas, Perot became a salesman for IBM after serving in the United States Navy. In 1962, he founded Electronic Data Systems, a data processing service company. In 1984, General Motors bought a controlling interest in the company for $2.4 billion ($ billion in ). Perot established Perot Systems in 1988 and was an angel investor for NeXT, a computer company founded by Steve Jobs after he left Apple. Perot also became heavily involved in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, arguing that hundreds of American servicemen were left behind in Southeast Asia after the Vietnam War. During the presidency of George H. W. Bush, Perot became increasingly active in politics and strongly opposed the Gulf War and ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

In 1992, Perot announced his intention to run for president and advocated a balanced budget, an end to the outsourcing of jobs, and the enactment of electronic direct democracy. A June 1992 Gallup poll showed Perot leading a three-way race against President Bush and presumptive Democratic nominee Bill Clinton. Perot withdrew from the race in July, but re-entered the race in early October after he qualified for all 50 state ballots. He chose Admiral James Stockdale as his running mate and appeared in the 1992 debates with Bush and Clinton. In the election, Perot did not win any electoral votes, but won over 19.7 million votes for an 18.9% share of the popular vote. He won support from across the ideological and partisan spectrum, but performed best among self-described moderates. Perot ran for president again in 1996, establishing the Reform Party as a vehicle for his campaign. He won 8.4 percent of the popular vote against President Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole.

Perot did not seek public office again after 1996. He endorsed Republican George W. Bush over Reform nominee Pat Buchanan in the 2000 election and supported Republican Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012. In 2009, Dell acquired Perot Systems for $3.9 billion ($ billion in ). According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Perot was the 167th richest person in the United States as of 2016. Perot died from leukemia in Dallas, Texas, on July 9, 2019.

== Early life, education, and military career ==
Ross Perot was born in Texarkana, Texas in 1930, the son of Lula May (née Ray) and Gabriel Ross Perot, a commodity broker specializing in cotton contracts. He had an older brother, Gabriel Perot Jr., who died as a toddler. His patrilineal line traces back to a French-Canadian immigrant to the colony of Louisiana in the 1740s.

Perot attended a local private school, Patty Hill, before graduating from Texas High School in Texarkana in 1947. His first job, at eight years old, was helping to distribute the &quot;Texarkana Gazette&quot; as a paperboy. He joined the Boy Scouts of America and made Eagle Scout in 1942, after 13 months in the program, and was a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. One of Perot&#x27;s childhood friends was Hayes McClerkin, who later became the Speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives and a prominent lawyer in Texarkana, Arkansas.

From 1947 to 1949, he attended Texarkana Junior College, then entered the United States Naval Academy in 1949 and helped establish its honor system. Perot claimed his appointment notice to the academy—sent by telegram—was sent by W. Lee &quot;Pappy&quot; O&#x27;Daniel, Texas&#x27;s 34th governor and former senator. Perot served as a junior officer on a destroyer, and later, an aircraft carrier from 1953 to 1957. Perot, who had only ever owned one pair of shoes at a time, was shocked to find that he was issued multiple pairs of shoes in the navy, which he would later point to as &quot;possibly my first example of government waste&quot;. Perot then went to the Naval Reserve, which he left on June 30, 1961, with the rank of lieutenant. His father died when Perot was 25 years old.

In 1956, Perot married Margot Birmingham, whom he met on a blind date as a midshipman docked in Baltimore.

==Business==
After he left the Navy in 1957, Perot became a salesman for IBM. He quickly became a top employee (one year, he fulfilled his annual sales quota in two weeks) and tried to pitch his ideas to supervisors, who largely ignored him. He left IBM in 1962 to found Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in Dallas, Texas, and courted large corporations for his data processing services. Perot was denied bids for contracts 77 times before receiving his first contract. EDS received lucrative contracts from the US government in the 1960s, computerizing Medicare records. EDS went public in 1968, and the stock price rose from $16 a share to $160 within days. &quot;Fortune&quot; called Perot the &quot;fastest, richest Texan&quot; in a 1968 cover story. In December 1969, his shares in EDS were briefly worth $1 billion. Perot gained some press attention for being &quot;the biggest individual loser ever on the New York Stock Exchange&quot; when his EDS shares dropped $445 million ($ billion in today&#x27;s money) in value in a single day in April 1970. While EDS boasted strong earnings in 1970, its exceptionally high price-to-earnings ratio, reaching 118 times earnings at its initial public offering in 1968, made it a prime target for a bear raid. The stock&#x27;s vulnerability was compounded by the fact that a significant portion of the publicly traded shares were &quot;weakly held&quot; by fast-performance mutual funds prone to rapid selling at the first sign of trouble. When the stock price began to decline on April 22nd, likely due to large-scale short selling, these institutional investors quickly unloaded their holdings, triggering a panic sell-off and a precipitous drop in the share price. This dramatic single-day decline in EDS stock was part of a broader collapse in the technology sector during the second quarter of 1970. The average computer stock plummeted 80% from its peak in late 1968. University Computing, for instance, suffered a devastating 93% loss in value. The overall market downturn, reflected in a 19% drop in the S&amp;P 500 during that quarter, was further fueled by a recessionary environment, growing sociopolitical unrest related to the Vietnam War and events like the Kent State shootings, and a general loss of confidence in the market after a period of exuberant speculation. Coincidentally, the EDS crash occurred on the first Earth Day, adding to the symbolic significance of the event.

In 1984, General Motors bought a controlling interest in EDS for $2.4 billion ($ billion). In 1985, Perot sold EDS to General Motors with the idea that he and EDS would have a leadership role within the company. However, Perot&#x27;s plan was ignored by the management of General Motors, prompting Perot to leave and later found Perot Systems. Perot&#x27;s experience with GM contributed to him becoming an outspoken critic of corporate America. 
In the same year, Perot became the second-richest man in the United States, only behind Sam Moore Walton, with a fortune estimated at $1.8 billion ($ billion), according to the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people in the United States.
Just before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the government of Iran imprisoned two EDS employees in a contract dispute. Perot organized and sponsored their rescue. The rescue team was led by retired United States Army Special Forces Colonel Arthur D. &quot;Bull&quot; Simons. When the team was unable to find a way to extract the two prisoners, they decided to wait for a group of revolutionaries to storm the jail and free all 10,000 inmates, many of whom were political prisoners. The two prisoners then connected with the rescue team, which led them out of Iran through a border crossing into Turkey. The exploit was recounted in the book &quot;On Wings of Eagles&quot; by Ken Follett. In 1986 this was turned into a two-part television mini-series (alternatively titled &quot;Teheran&quot;) with the actor Burt Lancaster playing the role of Colonel Simons and Richard Crenna as Perot.

In 1984, Perot&#x27;s Perot Foundation bought a very early copy of Magna Carta, one of only a few to leave the United Kingdom. The foundation lent it to the National Archives in Washington, D.C., where it was displayed alongside the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. In 2007, the foundation sold it to David Rubenstein, managing director of The Carlyle Group for $21.3 million ($ million) to be used &quot;for medical research, for improving public education and for assisting wounded soldiers and their families&quot;. It remains on display at the National Archives.

After Steve Jobs lost the power struggle at Apple and left to found NeXT, his angel investor was Perot, who invested over $20 million. Perot believed in Jobs and did not want to miss out, as he had with his chance to invest in Bill Gates&#x27;s fledgling Microsoft.

In 1988, he founded Perot Systems in Plano, Texas. His son, Ross Perot Jr., eventually succeeded him as CEO. In September 2009, Perot Systems was acquired by Dell for $3.9 billion ($ billion).

==Political activities==
=== Early political activities ===
After a visit to Laos in 1969, made at the request of the White House, in which he met with senior North Vietnamese officials, Perot became heavily involved in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. He believed that hundreds of American servicemen were left behind in Southeast Asia at the end of the U.S. involvement in the war, and that government officials were covering up POW/MIA investigations to avoid revealing a drug-smuggling operation used to finance a secret war in Laos. Perot engaged in unauthorized back-channel discussions with Vietnamese officials in the late 1980s, which led to fractured relations between Perot and the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations. In 1990, Perot reached an agreement with Vietnam&#x27;s Foreign Ministry to become its business agent if diplomatic relations were normalized. Perot also launched private investigations of, and attacks upon, United States Department of Defense official Richard Armitage.

In Florida in 1990, retired financial planner Jack Gargan, employing a famous quotation from the 1976 movie &quot;Network&quot;, funded a series of &quot;I&#x27;m mad as hell and I&#x27;m not going to take it anymore&quot; newspaper advertisements denouncing Congress for voting to give legislators pay raises at a time when average wages nationwide were not increasing. Gargan later founded &quot;Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out&quot; (THRO), which Perot supported.

Perot did not support President George H. W. Bush, and vigorously opposed the United States&#x27; involvement in the 1990–1991 Persian Gulf War. He unsuccessfully urged Senators to vote against the war resolution, and began to consider a presidential run.

=== 1992 presidential campaign ===
On February 20, 1992, Perot appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and announced his intention to run as an independent if his supporters could get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. With such declared policies as balancing the federal budget, favoring certain types of gun control, ending the outsourcing of jobs and enacting electronic direct democracy via &quot;electronic town halls&quot;, he became a potential candidate and soon polled roughly even with the two major-party candidates.

Perot denounced Congress for its inaction in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on March 18, 1992; he said:
Perot&#x27;s candidacy received increasing media attention when the competitive phase of the primary season ended for the two major parties. With the insurgent candidacies of Republican Pat Buchanan and Democrat Jerry Brown winding down, Perot was the natural beneficiary of populist resentment toward establishment politicians. On May 25, 1992, he was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; with the title &quot;Waiting for Perot&quot;, an allusion to Samuel Beckett&#x27;s play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;.

Several months before the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of election news, as his supporters began petition drives to get him on the ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat Hamilton Jordan and Republican Ed Rollins. While Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization United We Stand America. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he did call for was intended to reduce the deficit, such as a fuel tax increase and cutbacks to Social Security. In June, Perot led a Gallup poll with 39% of the vote.

In July, the Perot campaign fell into disarray and his polls fell sharply. The 1992 Democratic National Convention was held on Monday, July 13 through Thursday, July 16, during which time there was increased media coverage of the general election. &quot;The Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; reported that Perot&#x27;s campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by Perot&#x27;s unwillingness to follow their advice to be more specific on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations. The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; reported such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign loyalty oaths. Perot&#x27;s poll numbers had slipped to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Hamilton Jordan (a high-ranking manager in the Perot campaign) allegedly threatened to quit, but senior campaign officials denied this.

On July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist Hal Riney, who had worked with Rollins on the Reagan campaign. Rollins would later claim that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the Central Intelligence Agency. Amid the chaos, Perot&#x27;s support fell to 20%. The next day, Perot announced on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; that he would not seek the presidency. He explained that he did not want the House of Representatives to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. Perot eventually stated the reason was that he received threats that digitally altered photographs would be released by the Bush campaign to sabotage his daughter&#x27;s wedding. Whatever his reasons for withdrawing, his reputation was badly damaged. Many of his supporters felt betrayed, and public opinion polls subsequently showed a largely negative view of Perot that was absent before his decision to end the campaign.

In September, he qualified for all 50 state ballots. On October 1, he announced his intention to re-enter the presidential race. He campaigned in 16 states and spent an estimated $12.3 million of his own money. Perot employed the innovative strategy of purchasing half-hour blocks of time on major networks for infomercial-type campaign advertisements; this advertising garnered more viewership than many sitcoms, with one Friday night program in October attracting 10.5 million viewers.

At one point in June, Perot led the polls with 39% (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton). Just prior to the debates, Perot received 7–9% support in nationwide polls. The debates likely played a significant role in his ultimate receipt of almost 19% of the popular vote. Although his answers during the debates were often general, Frank Newport of Gallup concluded that Perot &quot;convincingly won the first debate, coming in significantly ahead of both the Democratic challenger Clinton and incumbent President George H.W. Bush&quot;. In the debate, he remarked:
In the 1992 election, he received 18.9% of the popular vote, about 19,741,065 votes, but no electoral college votes, making him the most successful non-major-party presidential candidate in terms of share of the popular vote since Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election. Unlike Perot, however, multiple third-party candidates since Roosevelt had won electoral college votes: Robert La Follette in 1924, Strom Thurmond in 1948, and George Wallace in 1968. Compared with Thurmond and Wallace, who polled very strongly in a small number of states, Perot&#x27;s vote was more evenly spread across the country. Perot managed to finish second in two states: in Maine, Perot received 30.44% of the vote—ahead of part-time resident Bush&#x27;s 30.39% (Clinton won Maine with 38.77%); and in Utah, Perot received 27.34% of the vote—ahead of Clinton&#x27;s 24.65% (Bush won Utah with 43.36%). Although Perot did not win a state, he received a plurality of votes in some counties. His popular vote total is still by far the most ever garnered for a non-major-party candidate, almost double the previous record set by Wallace in 1968.

A detailed analysis of voting demographics revealed that Perot&#x27;s support drew heavily from across the political spectrum, with 20% of his votes coming from self-described liberals, 27% from self-described conservatives, and 53% coming from self-described moderates. Economically, however, the majority of Perot voters (57%) were middle class, earning between $15,000 and $49,000 annually, with the bulk of the remainder drawing from the upper-middle class (29% earning more than $50,000 annually). Exit polls also showed that 38% of Perot voters would have otherwise voted for Bush, and 38% would have voted for Clinton. Though there were widespread claims that Perot acted as a &quot;spoiler&quot;, post-election analysis suggested that his presence in the race likely did not affect the outcome. According to Seymour Martin Lipset, the 1992 election had several unique characteristics. Voters felt that economic conditions were worse than they actually were, which harmed Bush. A strong third-party candidate was a rare event. Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House. The chief factor was Clinton&#x27;s uniting his party, and winning over a number of heterogeneous groups. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight described the theory that Perot was a spoiler as &quot;unlikely&quot;.

Based on his performance in the popular vote in 1992, Perot was entitled to receive federal election funding for 1996. Perot remained in the public eye after the election and championed opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). During the campaign, he had urged voters to listen for the &quot;giant sucking sound&quot; of American jobs heading south to Mexico should NAFTA be ratified.

=== Reform Party and 1996 presidential campaign ===
=== 1996 presidential campaign ===
Perot tried to keep his movement alive through the mid-1990s, continuing to speak about the increasing national debt. He was a prominent campaigner against NAFTA, and frequently claimed that American manufacturing jobs would go to Mexico. On November 10, 1993, Perot debated with then-Vice President Al Gore on the issue on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; with an audience of 16 million viewers. Perot&#x27;s behavior during the debate was a source of mirth thereafter, including his repeated pleas to &quot;let me finish&quot; in his southern drawl. The debate was seen by many as effectively ending Perot&#x27;s political career. Support for NAFTA went from 34% to 57%.

In 1995, he founded the Reform Party and won their presidential nomination for the 1996 United States presidential election. His vice presidential running mate was Pat Choate. Because of the ballot access laws, he had to run as an independent on many state ballots. Perot received 8% of the popular vote in 1996, lower than in the 1992 race, but still an unusually successful third-party showing by U.S. standards. He spent much less of his own money in this race than he had four years prior, and he also allowed other people to contribute to his campaign, unlike his prior race. One common explanation for the decline was Perot&#x27;s exclusion from the presidential debates, based on the preferences of the Democratic and Republican party candidates. Law professor Jamie Raskin filed a lawsuit over Perot&#x27;s exclusion years later.

=== Later activities ===

In the 2000 presidential election, Perot refused to become openly involved with the internal Reform Party dispute between supporters of Pat Buchanan and John Hagelin. Perot was reportedly unhappy with what he saw as the disintegration of the party, as well as his own portrayal in the press; thus, he chose to remain quiet. He appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; four days before the election and endorsed George W. Bush for president. Despite his earlier opposition to NAFTA, Perot remained largely silent about expanded use of guest-worker visas in the United States, with Buchanan supporters attributing this silence to his corporate reliance on foreign workers.

In 2005, Perot was asked to testify before the Texas Legislature in support of proposals to extend access to technology to students, including making laptops available to them. He supported changing the process of buying textbooks by making e-books available and by allowing schools to purchase books at the local level instead of going through the state. In an April 2005 interview, Perot expressed concern about the state of progress on issues that he had raised in his presidential runs.

In January 2008, Perot publicly came out against Republican candidate John McCain and endorsed Mitt Romney for president. He also announced that he would soon be launching a new website with updated economic graphs and charts. In June 2008, his blog launched, focusing on entitlements (Medicare, Medicaid, Social security), the U.S. national debt, and related issues. In 2012, Perot endorsed Romney for president again. Perot did not give any endorsements for the 2016 election.

==Political views==
Perot did not fit the usual political stereotypes; his views were seen as either pragmatic or populist, depending on the observer, and usually focused on his economic policy, such as balancing the budget, to gain support from both Democratic and Republican voters. Perot supported stricter gun control such as an assault weapons ban and supported increased research in AIDS. Perot was hesitant on covering the issue of gay rights during his 1992 campaign, but openly supported gay rights in 1996. 

Perot spoke in favor of &quot;comprehensive national health care plan — one that would be akin to Medicare but for all Americans, not just the needy&quot;. He also became known for his opposition to NAFTA; Perot believed that the power of corporations must be curbed, and saw the transfer of jobs to other countries as a symbol of corruption and inequality. He argued that such trade agreements only benefited the companies while robbing the US of its tax base and blue-collar jobs. Perot famously stated during the October 15 debate that NAFTA would create a &quot;giant sucking sound&quot; on American jobs.

The populism of Ross Perot is hard to define and is a contested topic amongst political scientists. Perot was described as a &quot;classical populist&quot;, liberal populist, &quot;telepopulist&quot; and also a &quot;third way&quot; populist. Neal Allen and Brian J. Brox argue that Perot was neither left nor right-wing ideologically, and focused first and foremost on promoting reforms of the political process and grassroots democracy; despite this, they also found some notable similarities between Perot and the left-wing populism of Ralph Nader, and an average Perot voter had liberal leanings. 

Anton Pelinka described Perot&#x27;s ideology as the &quot;populism of the centre&quot;, presenting a distinct form of populism that significantly differed from left-wing and right-wing populist movements that appeared in the USA. Matthijs Rooduijn argues that Perot was an example of a liberal populist with centre-left leanings, noting his hostility to Reaganomics - in the 1992 election, Perot stated that USA was in crisis caused by &quot;the decade of greed, the era of trickle-down economics&quot;. In his famous &quot;The Populist Explosion: How the Great Recession Transformed American and European Politics&quot; publication, John Judis wrote that &quot;Perot represented a left and center-left populism&quot;, in tradition of the Populist Party and Huey Long. According to Judis, Perot &quot;represented the first clear repudiation of the neoliberal agenda.&quot;

Regarding foreign policy, Perot was an outspoken opponent of the Gulf War and condemned Bush for the military intervention against Iraq. He instead promoted a more isolationist foreign policy, arguing that USA should focus on rebuilding its economy. In his 1992 presidential campaign, Perot stated that his &quot;highest foreign policy priority is to get our house in order and make America work again&quot;. He attacked Bush for his ties to Saddam Hussein prior to the invasion of Kuwait - according to Perot, the Bush administration covertly aided Hussein&#x27;s chemical weapons programs and turned a blind eye to Iraqi plans against Kuwait, instructing April Glaspie to greenlight Hussein&#x27;s invasion on assumption that he would only seize Kuwait&#x27;s northern oil fields. Perot claimed that Bush invaded Iraq because its actions threatened Bush&#x27;s &quot;manhood&quot;, and stated: &quot;off we go into the wild blue yonder with the lives of our servicemen at risk because of 10 years of stupid mistakes&quot;.

Perot also focused on anti-lobbying and political reform proposals - he favored a presidential line item veto against &quot;pork barrel spending and waste&quot;, elimination of political action committees (PACs) to curb the influence of special interest groups, replacement of the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act with a different balanced budget apparatus that would focus on limiting &quot;tricks, loopholes, and improper accounting procedures&quot; and a ban on exit polling during elections. He also postulated a ban on lobbying.

From 1992, Perot was a pro-choice activist, and a strong supporter of Planned Parenthood. He stated that poorer women in particular should have access to abortions via federal funding. From 2000, he was pro-choice reluctantly.
===Economic policy===
Perot believed taxes should be increased on the wealthy, while spending should be cut to help pay off the national debt. Perot also believed the capital gains tax should be increased, while giving tax breaks to those starting new businesses.
Together with increased taxes on the wealthy, Perot also supported curbing entitlement payments and tax rebates to the affluent, and spoke in favor of eliminating the government&#x27;s air fleet and other Washington perks for legislators, mocking the privileges that the US legislators enjoyed. He also argued that the government should protect the job base through intervention in the market. He spoke in support of creating a national industrial ministry based on the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which would increase state control over large businesses and direct their investment. Perot stressed that the government should ensure that both public and private investments would target the &quot;industries of the future&quot;. When asked about objections to his plans from free-market advocates, Perot said: &quot;Don’t they realize that the biogenetics industry is the result
of our federally funded research universities and the National Institutes of Health?&quot;

Perot was strongly opposed to neoliberalism, and was credited with marking the &quot;first clear repudiation&quot; of the neoliberal economic policies pursued by Ronald Reagan: 
In his 1993 book &quot;Not For Sale at Any Price&quot;, Perot expressed support for giving tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, as opposed to larger corporations. Additionally, Perot supported a balanced budget amendment, stating, &quot;spending should not exceed revenue for 27 consecutive years.&quot; On trade, Perot stated that NAFTA caused the trade deficit between Mexico and the United States and a loss of manufacturing jobs. His position on free trade and NAFTA became his defining campaign principle of both the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections. Perot argued: &quot;We have got to stop sending jobs overseas. It&#x27;s pretty simple: If you&#x27;re paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor, ... have no health care—that&#x27;s the most expensive single element in making a car—have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement, and you don&#x27;t care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.&quot;
For the 1992 election, Perot unveiled an ambitious budget program that would balance the budget through redistributive policies. The most prominent element of the plan was Perot&#x27;s proposal to raise the income tax bracket of 4% wealthiest households from 31 to 33 percent, and to raise it further to 35 percent in the future. Other points included increasing the taxable portion of Social Security benefits from 50 to 85 percent for recipients with income of $25,000 or more, as well as implementing a tax on hitherto tax-free employer-paid health insurance, with Perot arguing that a tax-free workplace insurance creates an unfair advantage for those who receive health insurance through their job. The plan also called for doubling cigarette tax and increasing gasoline tax by 50 cents a gallon; Perot explained that higher gasoline tax would help conserve energy and reduce pollution, but also advocated the creation of a special allowance for the workers disproportionately affected by the higher gasoline price. The plan also included massive cuts in military spending and scrapping the proposed space station project, which Perot derided as &quot;a vacation home in space&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

Perot and his wife Margot (née Birmingham; born November 15, 1933), a graduate of Goucher College, had five children (Ross Jr., Nancy, Suzanne, Carolyn, and Katherine) and 19 grandchildren.

Perot was raised in the Methodist faith, but he converted to Presbyterianism and became a member of the Highland Park Presbyterian Church in late 1960s. He was described as very faithful in church attendance.

Perot died from leukemia in Dallas, Texas, on July 9, 2019, less than two weeks after his 89th birthday. At the time of his death, he had an estimated net worth of about $4.1 billion ($ billion in ), and was ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the 167th-richest person in the United States. He was buried at the Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery and a memorial service was held at Highland Park United Methodist Church, with 1,300 invited guests.

<text>The phrase &quot;axis of evil&quot; was first used by U.S. President George W. Bush and originally referred to Iran, Ba&#x27;athist Iraq, and North Korea. It was used in Bush&#x27;s State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, less than five months after the September 11 attacks and almost a year before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and often repeated throughout his presidency. He used it to describe foreign governments that, during his administration, allegedly sponsored terrorism and sought weapons of mass destruction.

The notion of such an axis was used to pinpoint these common enemies of the United States and to rally the American population in support of the War on Terror. The countries originally covered by the term were Iran, Ba&#x27;athist Iraq, and North Korea. In response, Iran formed a political alliance that it called the &quot;Axis of Resistance&quot; comprising Iran, Ba&#x27;athist Syria and Hezbollah.

Later, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea were referred to as the &quot;new axis of evil&quot; by US politicians and commentators. The term &quot;axis of evil&quot; is a reference to the Axis powers of WWII (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Empire of Japan).

==Origins==

===David Frum===
The phrase was attributed to former Bush pro-Israel speechwriter David Frum, originally as the &quot;axis of hatred&quot; and then &quot;evil&quot;. Information about his authorship first came out when emails of Frum&#x27;s wife to friends were picked up by the media. Frum explained his rationale for creating the phrase &quot;axis of evil&quot; in his 2003 book &quot;The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush.&quot; According to Frum, in late December 2001 head speechwriter Michael Gerson gave him the assignment of articulating the case for dislodging the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in only a few sentences for the upcoming State of the Union address. Frum says he began by rereading President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;date which will live in infamy&quot; speech given on December 8, 1941, after the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. While Americans needed no convincing about going to war with Japan, Roosevelt saw the greater threat to the United States coming from Nazi Germany, and he had to make the case for fighting a two-ocean war.

Frum points in his book to a now often-overlooked sentence in Roosevelt&#x27;s speech which reads in part, &quot;...we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger us again.&quot; Frum interprets Roosevelt&#x27;s oratory like this: &quot;For FDR, Pearl Harbor was not only an attack—it was a warning of future and worse attacks from another, even more dangerous enemy.&quot; Japan, a country with one-tenth of America&#x27;s industrial capacity, a dependence on imports for its food, and already engaged in a war with China, was extremely reckless to attack the United States, a recklessness &quot;that made the Axis such a menace to world peace&quot;, Frum says. Saddam Hussein&#x27;s two wars, against Iran and Kuwait, were just as reckless, Frum decided, and therefore presented the same threat to world peace.

In his book Frum relates that the more he compared the Axis powers of World War II to modern &quot;terror states&quot;, the more similarities he saw. &quot;The Axis powers disliked and distrusted one another&quot;, Frum writes. &quot;Had the Axis somehow won the war, its members would quickly have turned on one another.&quot; Iran, Iraq, al-Qaeda, and Hezbollah, despite quarreling among themselves, &quot;all resented power of the West and Israel, and they all despised the humane values of democracy.&quot; There, Frum saw the connection: &quot;Together, the terror states and the terror organizations formed an axis of hatred against the United States.&quot;

Frum tells that he then sent off a memo with the above arguments and also cited some of the atrocities perpetrated by the Iraqi government. He expected his words to be chopped apart and altered beyond recognition, as is the fate of much presidential speechwriting, but his words were ultimately read by Bush nearly verbatim, though Bush changed the term &quot;axis of hatred&quot; to &quot;axis of evil&quot;. North Korea was added to the list, he says, because it was attempting to develop nuclear weapons, had a history of reckless aggression, and &quot;needed to feel a stronger hand&quot;.

===Yossef Bodansky===
A decade before the 2002 State of the Union address, in August 1992, the Israeli-American political scientist Yossef Bodansky wrote a paper entitled &quot;Tehran, Baghdad &amp; Damascus: The New Axis Pact&quot; while serving as the Director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare of the US House of Representatives. Although he did not explicitly apply the epithet &quot;evil&quot; to his New Axis, Bodansky&#x27;s axis was otherwise very reminiscent of Frum&#x27;s axis. Bodansky felt that this new Axis was a very dangerous development. The gist of Bodansky&#x27;s argument was that Iran, Iraq and Syria had formed a &quot;tripartite alliance&quot; in the wake of the First Gulf War, and that this alliance posed an imminent threat that could only be dealt with by invading Iraq a second time and overthrowing Saddam Hussein.

==2002 State of the Union Address==
In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush called North Korea &quot;A regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.&quot; He also stated Iran &quot;aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people&#x27;s hope for freedom.&quot; Bush gave the most criticism to Iraq, stating &quot;Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.&quot; Afterwards, Bush said, &quot;States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world.&quot;

==Bolton: &quot;Beyond the Axis of Evil&quot;==

On May 6, 2002, then-Undersecretary of State John Bolton gave a speech entitled &quot;Beyond the Axis of Evil&quot;. In it he added three more nations to be grouped with the already mentioned rogue states: Cuba, Libya, and Syria. The criteria for inclusion in this grouping were: &quot;state sponsors of terrorism that are pursuing or who have the potential to pursue weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or have the capability to do so in violation of their treaty obligations.&quot;

==China, Russia, Iran, North Korea new axis ==
In 2024, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and his predecessor, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, cautioned about the formation of a new axis of autocracies led by China, but joined by Russia, Iran and North Korea. The same states have been recognized as a new axis of evil by several American politicians, including Christopher Cavoli, Mike Johnson, and Mitch McConnell.

==Criticism==
Iran and Iraq fought the long Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s under basically the same leadership as that which existed at the time of Bush&#x27;s speech, leading some to believe that the linking of the nations under the same banner was misguided. Others argued that each of the three nations in the &quot;axis of evil&quot; had some special characteristics which were obscured by grouping them together. Anne Applebaum wrote about the debate over North Korea&#x27;s inclusion in the group.

In the days after the September 11 attacks, Ryan Crocker — who would later become the United States ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009 — and other senior U.S. State Department officials flew to Geneva to meet secretly with representatives of the government of Iran. For several months, Crocker and his Iranian counterparts cooperated on capturing Al Qaeda operatives in the region and fighting the Taliban government in Afghanistan. These meetings stopped after the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; speech hardened Iranian attitudes toward cooperating with the U.S.

Also, immediately after the attacks, the Iranian President Mohammad Khatami—in a message to the American people—showed sympathy with the victims and the Iranian people took to mosques and streets to pray and show their condolences.

None of the terrorists involved in 9/11 were citizens of the three nations Bush cited.

On the third anniversary of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, at the United Nations General Assembly meeting the USA joined axis of evil nations Russia and North Korea to vote against the UN motion condemning the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, and affirming support for Ukraine&#x27;s territorial integrity. Against the USA wishes, the measure was nevertheless adopted by the UN in an overwhelming majority, with 93 member states voting to condemn Russia’s 2022 invasion and demand it return territories occupied by its forces over the course of the ongoing war. Alongside the USA and Russia, opponents of the resolution included North Korea, Hungary, Israel and 13 others. Iran, China, and the United Arab Emirates were among the 65 that abstained.

==Other axes==
In January 2006, Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz implicated &quot;the axis of terror that operates between Iran and Syria&quot; following a suicide bomb in Tel Aviv.

In April 2006 the phrase &quot;axis of terror&quot; earned more publicity. Israel&#x27;s UN Ambassador, Dan Gillerman, cautioned of a new &quot;axis of terror&quot;—Iran, Syria and the Hamas-run Palestinian government; Gillerman repeated the term before the UN over the crisis in Lebanon. Some three months later Israeli senior foreign ministry official Gideon Meir branded the alleged alliance an &quot;axis of terror and hate&quot;.

In 2006, Isaias Afewerki, the president of Eritrea, had declared in response to the deteriorating relations with the neighboring countries of Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen by accusing them of being an &quot;Axis of Belligerence.&quot;

In 2006, the former president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, described the so-called New Latin Left as an &quot;axis of good&quot; which comprised Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela but described &quot;Washington and its allies&quot; as an &quot;axis of evil&quot;.

In 2007, the commander of Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps declared that the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel were part of an &quot;axis of evil&quot; alleging mass violence against the Islamic world, crimes against humanity and attempting to divide Shi&#x27;ites and Sunnis.

In 2008, &quot;The Economist&quot; featured an article about the &quot;Axis of Diesel&quot; in reference to a burgeoning alliance of Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. They cite the billions of dollars in arms sales to Venezuela and the construction of Iranian nuclear facilities as well as the rejection of added sanctions on Iran. They did conclude that the benefits of the arrangement were exaggerated, however.

From 2010 onward, the term &quot;Axis of Resistance&quot; has been used to describe an anti-Western and anti-Israeli alliance between Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, Iraqi Shia militias, and the Houthis.

In 2012, author William C. Martel, in a short essay for &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, wrote of an &quot;Authoritarian Axis&quot;, comprising China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela. Following the death of Venezuela&#x27;s Hugo Chávez in 2013, Martel removed Venezuela from the assigned list of countries, in his subsequent writings about the &quot;axis&quot;. Martel&#x27;s thesis drew criticism from &quot;The American Conservative&quot; and &quot;Muslim Village&quot;, with the main arguments cited in opposition to his idea being the lack of cohesion and generally low levels of cooperation shown between the cited countries.

Several environmental non-governmental organizations, including Greenpeace and the Green Party of Canada, have dubbed Australia, Canada and United States, the &quot;Axis of Environmental Evil&quot; because of their lack of support for international environmental agreements, particularly those related to climate change.

During a March 2018 interview with the Egyptian media, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman referred Iran, Turkey and Islamist organizations such as the Islamic State and the Muslim Brotherhood as the &quot;triangle of evil&quot;, to describe their current policies in the Middle East. Those remarks were later dismissed by Iran, describing it as &quot;childish&quot; and said that Saudi Arabia&#x27;s intervention in Yemen has &quot;caused instability and extremism and stuck in a quagmire&quot; in Yemen.

In October 2018, the economist Paul Krugman argued &quot;[t]here&#x27;s a new axis of evil: Russia, Saudi Arabia—and the United States&quot;, the three countries that declined to endorse the United Nation&#x27;s latest climate study at the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference.

In February 2022, American conservative political commentator Danielle Pletka called China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as the &quot;new&quot; axis of evil in an article for the &quot;National Review&quot;. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the &quot;Taipei Times&quot; published an editorial calling the alliance between the Russia and China &quot;the real axis of evil&quot;.

In October 2023, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told CBS&#x27; &quot;Face The Nation&quot; that Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China are the new &quot;axis of evil. The Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson echoed a very similar comment on Fox News&#x27; &quot;Hannity&quot;.

In October 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described an axis of evil involving Hamas and Iran in an op-ed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

On April 17, 2024, GOP U.S. speaker of the house Mike Johnson referred to China as part of &quot;the axis of evil&quot; that includes Iran, and Russia. Johnson based his statement on the belief that the countries pose threats the western-aligned countries of Taiwan, Israel, and Ukraine. This preceded a change of tact, where the speaker decided to support $95 billion of defence aid for the combined countries, despite the opposition of the more conservative members of his caucus.

In July 2024, British Army General Sir Patrick Sanders said that Russia, China and Iran were the &quot;new axis powers&quot; in an interview with The Times. He argued they posed more of a threat than Nazi Germany in 1939, stating &quot;They are more interdependent and more aligned than the original axis powers were&quot; and that the world is facing &quot;as dangerous a moment as any time that we&#x27;ve had since 1945&quot;. On July 23, newly appointed Army chief General Sir Roland Walker said in a speech that the UK faced danger from an &quot;axis of upheaval&quot; with threats from an angered Russia, that China was intent on retaking Taiwan, and that Iran was likely to pursue nuclear weapons.

==Media&#x27;s use of the term==
===Parodies===
Various related pun phrases include:
* &quot;Axis of weasels&quot; – mocking certain countries that did not support the 2003 invasion of Iraq
* &quot;Axis of Eve&quot; – a women&#x27;s political action group that opposed Bush through satirical expression
* &quot;Asses of evil&quot; – a mocking insult against George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and John Ashcroft

* &quot;Axes of Evil&quot; – the title of a song by the Canadian heavy metal band 3 Inches of Blood and the title of a book about Billy the Axeman
* The Axis of Awesome – an Australian musical comedy act

The term has also lent itself to various parodies, including the following:
* In a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit with host Jonny Moseley, George W. Bush played by Will Ferrell expands the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; (although he doesn&#x27;t mention North Korea, instead saying &quot;one of the Koreas&quot;) to include things with &quot;evil&quot; in it or things he does not understand (including Enron, Tom Daschle, the economy, France, those who &quot;mess with Texas&quot;, the &quot;original Axis of Evil&quot;, mathematics, Dick Cheney (for now), and Evel Knievel, with the exception of Dr. Evil). Ferrell mispronounces &quot;axis&quot; so it sound like &quot;Access of Evil&quot;.
* Serj Tankian, lead singer for the group System of a Down and Tom Morello, guitarist and former guitarist for Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave (respectively) founded a political action group called the &quot;Axis of Justice&quot;.
* Andrew Marlatt wrote an extensive parody for SatireWire, where Libya, China, and Syria formed the &quot;Axis of Just as Evil&quot; and other countries &quot;rushed to gain triumvirate status&quot; in a &quot;game of geopolitical chairs&quot;.
* &quot;The Economist&quot; ran a 2006 (May 13–19) cover headline titled &quot;Axis of Feeble&quot; about the end of the George Bush–Tony Blair partnership.
* King Dedede, a character from the Kirby series, refers to the titular character as an &quot;axis of evil&quot; in an episode of the Japanese version of the anime.

* In &quot;Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race&quot;, Sanders refers to the super-team composed of the Ice Dancers, the Police Cadets and the Haters as an &quot;axis of evil&quot;. Don laters coins them as such (to the displeasure of Ryan) and liking the sound of it, they form an alliance with the intent of backstabbing each other, though it later falls apart.

===Comedy tour===
In response to the problems which Americans of Middle-Eastern descent have in the current climate, a group of comedians have banded together to form the &quot;Axis of Evil Comedy Tour&quot;. The comedians, Ahmed Ahmed (from Egypt), Maz Jobrani (from Iran), and Aron Kader (whose father is Palestinian), have created a show which aired on Comedy Central. They have also included half-Palestinian, half-Italian Dean Obeidallah in some of their acts.

The group took the comedy tour around the Middle East (November–December 2007), performing in the UAE, Egypt, Kuwait, Jordan, and Lebanon to sell-out crowds.

===Lullabies===
In 2003 the Norwegian record label Kirkelig Kulturverksted published the CD &quot;Lullabies from the Axis of Evil&quot; containing 14 lullabies from Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Palestine, Syria, Afghanistan and Cuba. Every lullaby is presented in its original form sung by women from these countries, and then a western version with interpretations in English.
