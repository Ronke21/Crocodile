<text>The Illuminatus! Trilogy is a series of three novels by American writers Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, first published in 1975. The trilogy is a satirical, postmodern, science fiction–influenced adventure story; a drug-, sex-, and magic-laden trek through a number of conspiracy theories, both historical and imaginary, related to the authors&#x27; version of the Illuminati. The narrative often switches between third- and first-person perspectives in a nonlinear narrative. It is thematically dense, covering topics like counterculture, numerology, and Discordianism.

The trilogy comprises three parts which contain five books and appendices: The Eye in the Pyramid (first two books), The Golden Apple (third and part of fourth book), Leviathan (part of fourth and all of fifth book, and the appendices). The parts were first published as three separate volumes starting in September 1975. In 1984 they were published as an omnibus edition and are now more commonly reprinted in the latter form. In 1986 the trilogy won the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award. The authors further dealt with its themes in fiction and non-fiction works.

&quot;Illuminatus!&quot; has been adapted for the stage and as an audio book, and has influenced several modern writers, artists, musicians, and game-makers. The popularity of the word &quot;fnord&quot; and the 23 enigma can both be attributed to the trilogy.

== Narrative ==
The plot meanders between the thoughts, hallucinations and inner voices, real and imagined, of its many characters—ranging from a squirrel to a New York City detective to an artificial intelligence—as well as through time (past, present, and future), and sometimes in mid-sentence. Much of the back story is explained via dialogue between characters, who recount unreliable, often mutually contradictory, versions of their supposed histories. There are even parts in the book in which the narrative reviews and jokingly deconstructs the work itself.

=== Plot summary ===
The trilogy&#x27;s story begins with an investigation by two New York City police detectives (Saul Goodman and Barney Muldoon) into the bombing of &quot;Confrontation&quot;, a leftist magazine, and the disappearance of its editor, Joe Malik. Discovering the magazine&#x27;s investigation into the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr., the two follow a trail of memos that suggest the involvement of powerful secret societies. They slowly become drawn into a web of conspiracy theories. Meanwhile, the magazine&#x27;s reporter, George Dorn—having been turned loose without support deep in right-wing Mad Dog, Texas—is arrested for drug possession. He is jailed and physically threatened, at one point hallucinating about his own execution. The prison is bombed and he is rescued by the Discordians, led by the enigmatic Hagbard Celine, captain of a golden submarine. Hagbard represents the Discordians in their eternal battle against the Illuminati, the conspiratorial organization that secretly controls the world. He finances his operations by smuggling illicit substances.

The plot meanders around the globe to such locations as Las Vegas (where a potentially deadly, secret U.S. government-developed mutated anthrax epidemic has been accidentally unleashed); Atlantis (where Howard, the talking porpoise, and his porpoise aides help Hagbard battle the Illuminati); Chicago (where someone resembling John Dillinger was killed many years ago); and to the island of Fernando Poo (the location of the next great Cold War standoff between the Soviet Union, China and the United States).

The evil scheme uncovered late in the tale is an attempt to &quot;immanentize the eschaton&quot;, a secret scheme of the &quot;American Medical Association&quot;, an evil rock band, to bring about a mass human sacrifice, the purpose of which is the release of enough &quot;life-energy&quot; to give eternal life to a select group of initiates, including Adolf Hitler. The AMA are revealed to be four siblings (last name Saure) who comprise four of the five mysterious Illuminati Primi. The identity of the fifth remains unknown for much of the trilogy. The first European &quot;Woodstock&quot; festival, held at Ingolstadt, Bavaria (place of origin of the &quot;real&quot; historical Illuminati, also known as Bavarian Illuminati), is the chosen location for the sacrifice of the unwary victims, via the reawakening of hibernating Nazi battalions from the bottom of nearby (fictitious) Lake Totenkopf (a literal translation of contemporary American English &quot;dead head&quot;). The plot is foiled when, with the help of a 50-foot-tall incarnation of the goddess Eris, the four members of the AMA are killed: Wilhelm is killed by the monstrous alien being Yog-Sothoth, Wolfgang is shot by John Dillinger, Winifred is drowned by porpoises, and Werner is trapped in a sinking car.

The major protagonists, now gathered together on board the submarine, are menaced by the Leviathan, a giant, pyramid-shaped single-cell sea monster that has been growing in size for hundreds of millions of years. The over-the-top nature of this encounter leads some of the characters to question whether they are merely characters in a book. This metafictional note is swiftly rejected (or ignored) as they turn their attention to the monster again. The threat is neutralized by offering up their onboard computer as something for the creature to communicate with to ease its loneliness. Finally Hagbard manages to defeat the Illuminati Primi and travels to Alpha Centauri in 1999.

== Titles ==
The titles of the three volumes or parts (the front covers were titled &quot;Illuminatus! Part I The Eye in the Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Illuminatus! Part II The Golden Apple&quot; and &quot;Illuminatus! Part III Leviathan&quot;) refer to recurring symbols of elements of the plot.

&quot;The Eye in the Pyramid&quot; refers to the Eye of Providence, which in the novel represents particularly the Bavarian Illuminati, and makes a number of appearances (for example, as an altar and a tattoo).

&quot;The Golden Apple&quot; refers to the golden apple of discord, from the Greek myth of the Judgement of Paris. In the trilogy it is used as the symbol of the Legion of Dynamic Discord, a Discordian group; the golden apple makes a number of appearances, for example, on the cover, on a black flag, and as an emblem on a uniform.

&quot;Leviathan&quot; refers to the Biblical sea monster Leviathan, which is a potential danger to Hagbard&#x27;s submarine &quot;Leif Erickson&quot; (from the name of the Icelandic discoverer of America). It also refers to Thomas Hobbes&#x27; seminal work of political philosophy, &quot;Leviathan&quot;, as a metaphor for an all-encompassing, authoritarian state – a common metaphor used in libertarian discourse.

== Publishing history ==
The trilogy was originally written between 1969 and 1971 while Wilson and Shea were both associate editors for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. As part of the role, they dealt with correspondence from the general public on the subject of civil liberties, much of which involved paranoid rants about imagined conspiracies. The pair began to write a novel with the premise that &quot;all these nuts are right, and every single conspiracy they complain about really exists&quot;. In a 1980 interview given to the science fiction magazine &quot;Starship&quot;, Wilson suggested the novel was also an attempt to build a myth around Discordianism:

There was no specific division of labor in the collaborative writing process, although Shea&#x27;s writing tended towards melodrama, while Wilson&#x27;s parts tended towards satire. Wilson states in a 1976 interview conducted by Neal Wilgus:

According to Ken Campbell, who created a stage adaptation of &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; with Chris Langham, the writing process was treated as a game of one-upmanship between the two co-authors, and was an enjoyable experience for both:

The unusual end product did not appeal to publishers, and it took several years before anybody agreed to take it on. According to Wilson, the division of &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; into three parts was a commercial decision of the publisher, not the authors, who had conceived it as a single continuous volume. Shea and Wilson were required to cut 500 pages to reduce printing costs on what was seen as a risky venture, although Wilson states that most of the ideas contained therein made it into his later works. The idea that the top secrets of the Illuminati were cut from the books because the printer decided to trim the number of pages is a joke typical of the trilogy.

Dell Publishing first released these individual editions (with covers illustrated by Carlos Victor Ochagavia) in the United States in 1975, to favorable reviews and some commercial success. It became a cult favorite but did not cross over into large mainstream sales. In Britain, Sphere Books released the individual editions (with different cover art by Tony Roberts) in 1976. The individual editions sold steadily until 1984, when the trilogy was republished in a single omnibus volume for the first time. This collected edition lost the &quot;what has gone before&quot; introduction to &quot;The Golden Apple&quot; and the &quot;Prologue&quot; to &quot;Leviathan&quot;. Some of the material in that foreword, such as the self-destruct mynah birds (taught to say &quot;Here, kitty-kitty-kitty!&quot;), appears nowhere else in the trilogy, likely a result of the 500 pages of cuts demanded by Dell. The omnibus edition gave a new lease on life to flagging sales, and became the most commonly available form of the trilogy from then on.

The trilogy was translated and published in German, again both as separate volumes (the three covers of which formed a triptych) and an omnibus. The face of J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs was split across the first two volumes, despite the Church of the SubGenius not being featured in the novel (although Wilson had become a member). The Church was founded by &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; fans, and the image of &quot;Bob&quot; is widely considered to be a representation of Wilson himself.

== Themes ==
&quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; covers a wide range of subjects throughout the book. These include discussions about mythology, current events, conspiracy theories and counterculture.

=== Conspiracies ===
Although the many conspiracy theories in the book are imaginary, these are mixed in with enough truth to make them seem plausible. For example, the title of the first book, &quot;The Eye in the Pyramid&quot;, refers to the Eye of Providence, a mystical symbol which derives from the ancient Egyptian Eye of Horus and is erroneously claimed to be the symbol of the Bavarian Illuminati. Some of America&#x27;s founding fathers are alleged by conspiracy theorists to have been members of this sect.

The books are loaded with references to the Illuminati, the Argenteum Astrum, many and various world domination plans, conspiracy theories and pieces of gnostic knowledge. Many of the odder conspiracies in the book are taken from unpublished letters to &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, where the authors were working as associate editors while they wrote the novels. Among the oddest was the suggestion that Adam Weishaupt, founder of the Bavarian Illuminati, killed George Washington and took on his identity as President of the United States. This is often noted in Illuminati-conspiracy discussion. Proponents of this theory point to Washington&#x27;s portrait on the United States one-dollar bill, which they suggest closely resembles the face of Weishaupt.

=== Fnord ===
The nonsense word &quot;fnord&quot;, invented by the writers of &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, is given a specific and sinister meaning in the trilogy. It is a subliminal message technique, a word that the majority of the population since early childhood has been trained to ignore (and trained to forget both the training and that they are ignoring it), but which they associate with a vague sense of unease. Upon seeing the word, readers experience a panic reaction. They then subconsciously suppress all memories of having seen the word, but the sense of panic remains. They therefore associate the unease with the news story they are reading. Fnords are scattered liberally in the text of newspapers and magazines, causing fear and anxiety in those following current events. There are no fnords in the advertisements, thus encouraging a consumerist society. &quot;Fnord&quot; magazine equated the fnords with a generalized effort to control and brainwash the populace. To &quot;see the fnords&quot; would imply an attempt to wrestle back individual autonomy, similar to the idea of , especially since the word fnord was actually said to appear between regular lines of text.

The word makes its first appearance in &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; without any explanation during an acid trip by Dr. Ignotum Per Ignotius and Joe Malik: &quot;The only good fnord is a dead fnord&quot;. Several other unexplained appearances follow. Only much later in the story is the secret revealed, when Malik is hypnotized by Hagbard Celine to recall suppressed memories of his first-grade teacher conditioning his class to ignore the fnords: &quot;If you don&#x27;t see the fnord it can&#x27;t eat you, don&#x27;t see the fnord, don&#x27;t see the fnord...&quot;

=== Numerology ===
Numerology is given great credence by many of the characters, with the Law of Fives in particular being frequently mentioned. Hagbard Celine states the Law of Fives in Appendix Gimmel: &quot;All phenomena are directly or indirectly related to the number five.&quot; He gives away the secret when he adds, &quot;given enough ingenuity on the part of the demonstrator. That&#x27;s the very model of what a scientific law must always be: a statement about how the human mind relates to the cosmos.&quot; (Late in the work, Celine demonstrates the meaninglessness of the Law of Fives by showing another character a picture of a young girl with six fingers on each hand and saying, &quot;If we were all like her, there&#x27;d be a Law of Sixes.&quot;) Another character, Simon Moon, identifies what he calls the &quot;23 synchronicity principle&quot;, which he credits William S. Burroughs as having discovered. Both laws involve finding significance in the appearance of the number, and in its &quot;presen[ce] esoterically because of its conspicuous exoteric absence.&quot; One of the reasons Moon finds 23 significant is because &quot;All the great anarchists died on the 23rd day of some month or other.&quot; He also identifies a &quot;23/17 phenomenon.&quot; They are both tied to the Law of Fives, he explains, because 2 + 3 = 5, and 1 + 7 = 8 = 2³. Robert Anton Wilson claimed in a 1988 interview that &quot;23 is a part of the cosmic code. It&#x27;s connected with so many synchronicities and weird coincidences that it must mean something, I just haven&#x27;t figured out yet what it means!&quot;.

=== Counterculture ===
The books were written at the height of the late 1960s, and are infused with the popular counterculture ideas of that time. For instance, the New Age slogan &quot;flower power&quot; is referenced via its German form, &quot;Ewige Blumenkraft&quot; (literally &quot;eternal flower power&quot;), described by Shea and Wilson as a slogan of the Illuminati, the enemies of the hippie ideal. The book&#x27;s attitude to New Age philosophies and beliefs are ambiguous. Wilson explained in a later interview: &quot;I&#x27;m some kind of antibody in the New Age movement. on the rewrite we deliberately threw in a couple of references to it, but we had worked out the structure on our own, mostly on the basis of the nut mail that Playboy gets&quot;.

The prevalence of kinky sex in the story reflects the hippie ideal of &quot;free love&quot;; characters are both liberal-minded and promiscuous. The authors are well aware that it also provides an excuse for mere titillation: in a typically self-referential joke, a character in the story suggests the scenes exist: &quot;only to sell a bad book filled with shallow characters pushing a nonsense conspiracy&quot;. Similarly, the books espouse the use of mind-altering substances to achieve higher states of consciousness, in line with the beliefs of key counterculture figures like Timothy Leary, who is mentioned throughout the three novels. Leary himself called the trilogy &quot;more important than &quot;Ulysses&quot; or &quot;Finnegans Wake,&quot;&quot; two novels by author James Joyce—who appears as a character in &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; and is a favorite author of Robert Anton Wilson. This quote is blurbed on the covers or front page of its various printings.

=== Cognitive dissonance ===
Every view of reality that is introduced in the story is later derided in some way, whether that view is traditional or iconoclastic. The trilogy is an exercise in cognitive dissonance, with an absurdist plot built of seemingly plausible, if unprovable, components. Ultimately, readers are left to form their own interpretations as to which, if any, of the numerous contradictory viewpoints presented by the characters are valid or plausible, and which are simply satirical gags and shaggy dog jokes. This style of building up a viable belief system, then tearing it down to replace it with another one, was described by Wilson as &quot;guerrilla ontology&quot;.

This postmodern lack of belief in consensus reality is a cornerstone of the semi-humorous Chaos-based religion of Discordianism. Extracts from its sacred text, the &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; by Malaclypse the Younger, are extensively quoted throughout the trilogy. It incorporates and shares many themes and contexts from &quot;Illuminatus&quot;. Shea and Wilson dedicated the first part &quot;To Gregory Hill and Kerry Thornley&quot;, the founders of the religion. The key Discordian practice known as &quot;Operation Mindfuck&quot; is exemplified in the character of Markoff Chaney (a play on the mathematical random process called Markov chain). He is an anti-social dwarf who engages in subtle practical joking in a deliberate attempt to cause social confusion. One such joke involves the forging and placing of signs that are signed by &quot;The Mgt.&quot; (leading people to believe they are from &quot;The Management&quot; instead of &quot;The Midget&quot;) that contain absurdities like &quot;Slippery when wet. Maintain 50mph.&quot;

=== Self-reference ===
There are several parts in the book where it reviews and jokingly deconstructs itself. The fictional journalist Epicene Wildeblood at one point is required to critique a book uncannily similar to &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;:

Several protagonists come to the realization that they are merely fictional characters, or at least begin to question the reality of their situation. George Dorn wonders early on if he &quot;was in some crazy surrealist movie, wandering from telepathic sheriffs to homosexual assassins, to nympho lady Masons, to psychotic pirates, according to a script written in advance by two acid-heads and a Martian humorist&quot;. Hagbard Celine claims towards the climax that the entire story is a computer-generated synthesis of random conspiracies: &quot;I can fool the rest of you, but I can&#x27;t fool the reader. FUCKUP has been working all morning, correlating all the data on this caper and its historical roots, and I programmed him to put it in the form of a novel for easy reading. Considering what a lousy job he does at poetry, I suppose it will be a high-camp novel, intentionally or unintentionally.&quot;

=== Allusions to other works ===
For a work of fiction, &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; contains a lot of references to songs, films, articles, novels and other media. This is partly because the characters themselves are involved in doing research, but it is also a trademark of Wilson&#x27;s writing.

The novel &quot;Telemachus Sneezed&quot; by the character Atlanta Hope with its catchphrase &quot;What is John Guilt?&quot; is a spoof of Ayn Rand&#x27;s &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, the origin of the character John Galt. Ayn Rand is mentioned by name a few times in &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;, and her novel is alluded to by Hagbard who says, &quot;If Atlas can Shrug and Telemachus can Sneeze, why can&#x27;t Satan Repent?&quot; Rand is also disparaged in one of the appendices concerning property, ostensibly written by Hagbard, which serves as an explanation of anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&#x27;s views on the subject. There are also references to Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; and his &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, an equally enormous experimental novel concerning liberty and paranoia that was published two years prior to &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; Wilson claims his book was already complete by the time he and Shea read Pynchon&#x27;s novel (which went on to win several awards), but they then went back and made some modifications to the text before its final publication to allude to Pynchon&#x27;s work. The phrase &quot;So it goes&quot; is repeatedly used in reference to death, a deliberate echoing of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;.

Author H. P. Lovecraft is alluded to often, with many mentions of characters (e.g., Robert Harrison Blake, Henry Armitage, Klarkash-Ton), monsters (e.g., Tsathoggua, Yog-Sothoth, Cthulhu), books (&quot;Necronomicon&quot;, &quot;Unaussprechlichen Kulten&quot;) and places (Miskatonic University) from his Cthulhu Mythos. He even appears himself as a character, as does his aunt Annie Gamwell and one of his acquaintances, Hart Crane. Interest in Lovecraft reached new heights in 1975, with two full-length biographies published in the same year as &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;.

== Reviews and reputation ==
The books have received laudatory reviews and comments from &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, the American Library Association&#x27;s &quot;Booklist&quot; magazine, &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;, &quot;Berkeley Barb&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Limit&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;The ultimate conspiracy book ... the biggest sci-fi-cult novel to come along since &quot;Dune&quot; ... hilariously raunchy!&quot; John White of the &quot;New Age Journal&quot; described it as:

&quot;The Fortean Times&quot; was also enthusiastic, whilst acknowledging the difficulties many readers would have attempting to follow the convoluted plot threads:

&quot;Illuminatus!&quot; even garnered some attention outside literary criticism, having several pages devoted to it in a chapter on the American New Right in &quot;Architects of Fear: Conspiracy Theories and Paranoia in American Politics&quot; by George Johnson (1983).

In more recent years, it was complimented in the bibliography to the &quot;New Hackers Dictionary&quot; as a book that can help readers &quot;understand the hacker mindset.&quot; The Dictionary described it as:

It was also included in the &quot;Slack Syllabus&quot; in &quot;The Official Slacker Handbook&quot; by Sarah Dunn (1994), a satirical guide aimed at Generation X.

== Follow-ups ==
Wilson and Robert Shea went on to become prolific authors. While Shea concentrated mainly on historical novels, Wilson produced over 30 works, mixing fictional novels with nonfiction. Although both authors&#x27; later work often elaborated on concepts first discussed in &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;, the pair never collaborated again. The trilogy inspired a number of direct adaptations, including a stage play and a comic book series, and numerous indirect adaptations that borrowed from its themes.

=== Shea and Wilson ===
Wilson subsequently wrote a number of prequels, sequels and spin-offs based upon the &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; concept, including an incomplete pentalogy called &quot;The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles&quot;, a standalone work entitled &quot;Masks of the Illuminati&quot; and &quot;The Illuminati Papers&quot;, in which several chapters are attributed to the trilogy&#x27;s characters. Many of Wilson&#x27;s other works, fictional and nonfictional, also make reference to the Illuminati or the &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; books. Several of the characters from &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;, for example, Markoff Chaney (&quot;The Midget&quot;) and Epicene Wildeblood, return in Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat Trilogy&quot;, which also carries on some of its themes. The third book of the &quot;Cat&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Homing Pigeons&quot;, is actually mentioned as a sequel to &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; in &quot;Appendix Mem&quot;. In 1998, Wilson published an encyclopedia of conspiracy theories called &quot;Everything is Under Control&quot;, which explains the origins of many of the theories mentioned in &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;.

Wilson and Shea planned to recollaborate on a true sequel, &quot;Bride of Illuminatus&quot;, taking place in 2026. It was rumored that it would feature a resurrected Winifred Saure (the only female member of the American Medical Association) exerting her influence through virtual reality. Shea died in 1994 before this project came to fruition. An excerpt was published in Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Trajectories Newsletter: The Journal of Futurism and Heresy&quot; in spring 1995. In a 1994 interview for &quot;FringeWare Review&quot;, Wilson suggested he may even &quot;do a Son of Illuminatus later&quot;. In &quot;Intelligence Agents&quot; by Timothy Leary (1996) he was credited with having already authored &quot;Son of Illuminatus&quot; in the 1980s.

Shea never wrote another &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;-related book, although many of his later novels include references to the themes of that work. &quot;Locus&quot; called his Saracen novels &quot;deep background for the &quot;Illuminatus&quot; trilogy&quot;.

=== Adaptations ===
An audacious proposal by the English experimental theater director Ken Campbell to stage &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; in its entirety at The National Theatre in London was met with surprisingly open arms, particularly given its inordinate length: a cycle of five plays—&quot;The Eye of the Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Swift Kick Inc.&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Murdered God&quot;, &quot;Walpurgisnacht Rock&quot; and &quot;Leviathan&quot;—each consisting of five 23-minute acts. Sir Peter Hall, director of the National at the time, wrote of Campbell in his &quot;Diaries&quot;, &quot;He is a total anarchist and impossible to pin down. He more or less said it was a crime to be serious.&quot;

The adaptation became the very first production at the National&#x27;s Cottesloe Theatre space, running from 4 March to 27 March 1977. It had first opened in Liverpool on 23 November 1976. The first night of the London version featured Robert Anton Wilson, accompanied by Shea, as a naked extra in the witches&#x27; sabbat scene. Wilson was delighted with the adaptation, saying: &quot;I was thunderstruck at what a magnificent job they did in capturing the exact tone and mixture of fantasy and reality in the book. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this isn&#x27;t literature. It&#x27;s too late in the day for literature. This is magic!&quot;

The 23-strong cast featured several actors, such as Jim Broadbent, David Rappaport and Chris Langham, who went on to successful film, stage and television careers. Broadbent alone played more than a dozen characters in the play. Bill Drummond designed sets for the show, and it was eventually seen (when it moved to London, with Bill Nighy then joining the cast) by the young Jimmy Cauty. Drummond and Cauty went on to form the &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;-inspired electronica band The KLF.

In thanks, Wilson dedicated his &quot;Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati&quot; (1977) to &quot;Ken Campbell and the Science-Fiction Theatre Of Liverpool, England.&quot; The play was later staged in Seattle, Washington in 1978.

No film or video exists of the performances at The National Theatre. A full audio recording is available as a limited edition perk in the crowdfunding for the 2014 stage play of Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati&quot;, adapted by Daisy Eris Campbell (Ken Campbell&#x27;s daughter).

An attempt was made to adapt the trilogy in comic book form beginning in the 1980s, by &quot;Eye-n-Apple Productions&quot; headed by Icarus! Icarus! met with Wilson in 1984 and subsequently obtained permission from Wilson&#x27;s agent to adapt the trilogy. &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; #1 was issued in July 1987, then reissued in substantially revised form later that year by Rip Off Press (who had published the original 4th edition of the &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; in 1970).

A second issue followed in 1990, and a third in March 1991, after which the venture stalled (although several ashcans of the as yet unpublished Fourth Trip were distributed at comic book conventions in the Detroit and Chicago areas between 1991 and 2006).

=== Influence ===
The infamous 1980s computer hacker Karl Koch was heavily influenced by &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;. Besides adopting the pseudonym &quot;Hagbard&quot; from the character Hagbard Celine, he also named his computer &quot;FUCKUP&quot;, after a computer designed and built by that character. He was addicted to cocaine and became extremely paranoid, convinced he was fighting the Illuminati like his literary namesake. In 1987 he wrote a rambling seven-page &quot;hacking manifesto of sorts, complete with his theories on Hagbard Celine and the Illuminati&quot;. The 1998 German motion picture &quot;23&quot; told a dramatized version of his story; Robert Anton Wilson appeared as himself.

A card game, &quot;Illuminati&quot;, inspired by the trilogy, was created by Steve Jackson Games. Using the &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; books as &quot;spiritual guides but not as actual source material&quot;, it incorporated competing conspiracies of the Bavarian Illuminati and Discordians and others, though no characters or groups specific to the novels. A trading card game () and role-playing game supplement (&quot;GURPS Illuminati&quot;) followed. The instruction booklets&#x27; bibliographies praise the novel and Wilson particularly, calling &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; in part &quot;required reading for any conspiracy buff&quot;. Robert Shea provided a four-paragraph introduction to the rulebook for the Illuminati Expansion Set 1 (1983), in which he wrote, &quot;Maybe the Illuminati are behind &quot;this game&quot;. They must be—they are, by definition, behind &quot;everything&quot;.&quot; Despite this initial involvement, Wilson later criticized some of these products for exploiting the &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; name without paying royalties (taking advantage of what he viewed as a legal loophole).

&quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; is steeped with references to the 1960s popular music scene (at one point a list of 200 fictional bands performing at the Walpurgisnacht rock festival is reeled off (including a handful of actual bands of the &#x27;60s), and there are numerous references to the famous rock and roll song &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;), and has influenced many bands and musicians. One of the aliases of anarchic British band The KLF was named after a secret society from the trilogy. They released much of their early material under the name &quot;The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu&quot;/&quot;The JAMMs&quot;, cf. &quot;The Justified Ancients of Mummu&quot;/&quot;The JAMs&quot; from the trilogy, and much of their work was Discordian in nature. They mirrored the fictional JAMs&#x27; gleeful political tactics of causing chaos and confusion by bringing a direct, humorous but nevertheless revolutionary approach to making records. The American band Machines of Loving Grace took the name of a sex act performed by one of the main characters during a Black Mass for the title of their song &quot;Rite of Shiva&quot; on their eponymous album. UK chillout maestro Mixmaster Morris also named his band The Irresistible Force after one that appears at the festival in the last part of the trilogy. Together with Coldcut he organised a huge Robert Anton Wilson Memorial Show at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London on 18 March 2007.

In general, &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; can be credited with popularizing the genre of conspiracy fiction, a field later mined by authors like Umberto Eco (&quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot;), Charles Cecil (Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars) and Dan Brown (&quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot;), comic book writers like Alan Moore (&quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, &quot;From Hell&quot;), Dave Sim (&quot;Cerebus&quot;) and Grant Morrison (&quot;The Invisibles&quot;), and screenwriters like Chris Carter (&quot;The X-Files&quot;) and Damon Lindelof (&quot;Lost&quot;). In particular, the regular use of the Illuminati in popular culture as shadowy central puppet masters in this type of fiction can be traced back to their exposure via &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;.

<doc id="38217" wikidata="Q8582" url="?curid=38217" title="Fnord">
<text>&quot;Fnord&quot; () is a word coined in 1965 by Kerry Thornley and Greg Hill in the Discordian religious text &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;. It entered into popular culture after appearing in &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; (1975) of novels written by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. Here, the interjection &quot;fnord&quot; is given hypnotic power over the unenlightened, and children in grade school are taught to be unable to see the word consciously. For the rest of their lives, every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of unease and confusion which prevents rational consideration of the text in which it appears.

==Other uses== 
The word has been used in newsgroup and hacker culture to indicate irony, humor, or Surrealism. Placement at the end of a statement in brackets (&quot;fnord&quot;) explicitly tags the intent, and may be so applied to any random or surreal sentence, coercive subtext, or anything jarringly out of context, intentional or not. It is sometimes used as a metasyntactic variable in programming. Fnord appears in the Church of the SubGenius recruitment film &quot;Arise!&quot; and has been used in the SubGenius newsgroup alt.slack.

==Origins==
The word was coined as a nonsensical term with religious undertones in the Discordian parody of religious texts &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; (1965), by Kerry Thornley and Greg Hill, but was popularized by &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; (1975) of satirical conspiracy fiction novels, by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; was produced, in the United Kingdom, as a cycle of plays by anarchic theatre director Ken Campbell and his Jungian Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool. The plays further popularized the term.

In the novel trilogy (and the plays), the interjection &quot;fnord&quot; is given hypnotic power over the unenlightened. Under the Illuminati program, children in grade school are taught to be unable to consciously see the word &quot;fnord&quot;. For the rest of their lives, every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of unease and confusion, preventing rational consideration of the text it appears in. The uneasiness and confusion create a perpetual low-level state of fear in the populace. The government acts on the premise that a fearful populace keeps them in power.

In the Shea/Wilson construct, fnords—occurrences of the word &quot;fnord&quot;—are scattered liberally in the text of newspapers and magazines, causing fear and anxiety in those following current events. However, there are no fnords in the advertisements, encouraging a consumerist society. The exclusion of the text from rational consciousness also enables the Illuminati to publish messages to each other in newspapers, etc., without fear that other people will be aware of them. It is implied in the books that &quot;fnord&quot; is not the actual word used for this task, but merely a substitute, since most readers would be unable to see the actual word.

To &quot;see the fnords&quot; means to be unaffected by the supposed hypnotic power of the word or, more loosely, of other fighting words. The term may also be used to refer to the experience of becoming aware of a phenomenon&#x27;s ubiquity after first observing it. The phrase &quot;I have seen the fnords&quot; was graffitied on a British railway bridge throughout the 1980s and 1990s, until the bridge was upgraded. The bridge, located between Earlsdon and Coventry city centre, is known locally as &quot;Anarchy Bridge&quot;. The bridge and the phrase were mentioned in the novel &quot;A Touch of Love&quot; by Jonathan Coe.

==Usage==

The lack of a clear definition of the word, and its popularity among certain groups on the internet, allowed it to be appropriated as a placeholder word (a metasyntactic variable) in computer programming, particularly by those with ties to Discordianism or the Church of the SubGenius. It has also been found useful as the name for a &quot;techno cultural&quot; conference, computer programs, and as a general placeholder word in computing literature.

Fnord! is the name of a (now defunct) freeware NT web server created by Brian Morin in 1995 and transferred to the care of Stephen Kazmierczak in 1997 when Morin was initiated into the summer Internet Server group at Microsoft. In his final transmission, Morin cites concern for potential legal backlash from the established tech giant as the reason for abandoning development of the free Fnord! server solution. Microsoft released Windows 95 and the accompanying Microsoft Network in the same time frame, which was seen as a play by the tech giant to monopolize the emerging online experience of dial-up users by introducing a toll road style business plan for accessing the world&#x27;s information.

Paulo Goode, a typeface designer from West Cork, Ireland, created a serif font named Fnord in 2016 which contains 23 fonts in five weights. The geometry of the upper case &#x27;O&#x27; is drawn on an axis of 23 degrees while the lower case &#x27;o&#x27; falls on a 17-degree axis. The 23 / 17 numerology is reflective of similar numerical themes from The Illuminatus! Trilogy.

<doc id="38218" wikidata="Q15948" url="?curid=38218" title="Émile Durkheim">
<text>David Émile Durkheim (; or ; 15 April 1858 – 15 November 1917) was a French sociologist. Durkheim formally established the academic discipline of sociology and is commonly cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science, along with both Karl Marx and Max Weber.

Much of Durkheim&#x27;s work was concerned with how societies can maintain their integrity and coherence in modernity, an era in which traditional social and religious ties are much less universal, and in which new social institutions have come into being. Durkheim&#x27;s conception of the scientific study of society laid the groundwork for modern sociology, and he used such scientific tools as statistics, surveys, and historical observation in his analysis of suicides in Catholic and Protestant groups.

Durkheim&#x27;s first major sociological work was (1893; &quot;The Division of Labour in Society&quot;), followed in 1895 by (&quot;The Rules of Sociological Method&quot;). Also in 1895 Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology and became France&#x27;s first professor of sociology. Durkheim&#x27;s seminal monograph, &quot;Le Suicide&quot; (1897), a study of suicide rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern social research, serving to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy. In 1898, he established the journal &quot;L&#x27;Année sociologique&quot;. (1912; &quot;The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life&quot;) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.

Durkheim was preoccupied with the acceptance of sociology as a legitimate science. Refining the positivism originally set forth by Auguste Comte (1798-1857), he promoted what could be considered as a form of epistemological realism, as well as the use of the hypothetico-deductive model in social science. For Durkheim, sociology was the science of &quot;institutions&quot;, understanding the term in its broader meaning as the &quot;beliefs and modes of behaviour instituted by the collectivity,&quot; with its aim being to discover structural social facts. As such, Durkheim was a major proponent of structural functionalism, a foundational perspective in both sociology and anthropology. In his view, social science should be purely holistic in the sense that sociology should study phenomena attributed to society at large, rather than being limited to the study of specific actions of individuals.

He remained a dominant force in French intellectual life until his death in 1917, presenting numerous lectures and publishing works on a variety of topics, including the sociology of knowledge, morality, social stratification, religion, law, education, and deviance. Some terms that he coined, such as &quot;collective consciousness&quot;, are now also used by laypeople.

==Early life and education==
David Émile Durkheim was born 15 April 1858 in Épinal, Lorraine, France, to Mélanie (Isidor) and Moïse Durkheim, coming into a long lineage of devout French Jews. His parents had four other children: Israël (1845-1846), Rosine (1848-1930), Félix (1850-1889) and Céline (1851-1931). Durkheim came from a long line of rabbis, stretching back eight generations, including his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather and began his education in a rabbinical school. However at an early age he switched schools, deciding not to follow in his family&#x27;s footsteps. In fact Durkheim led a completely secular life, whereby much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. Nevertheless Durkheim did not sever ties with his family nor with the Jewish community. In fact many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, some even being blood relatives. For instance Marcel Mauss, a notable social anthropologist of the prewar era, was his nephew.

A precocious student, Durkheim entered the École normale supérieure (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt. The entering class that year was one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century, as many of his classmates, such as Jean Jaurès and Henri Bergson, went on to become major figures in France&#x27;s intellectual history as well. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a classicist with a social-scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin dissertation on Montesquieu. At the same time, he read Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer, whereby Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society early on in his career. This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no social science curriculum at the time. Durkheim found humanistic studies uninteresting, turning his attention from psychology and philosophy to ethics and, eventually, sociology. He obtained his &quot;agrégation&quot; in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.

The opportunity for Durkheim to receive a major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by his approach to society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools. In the 1885-6 school year he visited Germany, where he travelled and studied sociology at the universities of Marburg, Berlin and Leipzig. As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of empiricism and its language of concrete, complex things, in sharp contrast to the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the Cartesian method. By 1886, as part of his doctoral dissertation, he had completed the draft of his &quot;The Division of Labour in Society&quot;, and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.

==Academic career==
Durkheim&#x27;s period in Germany resulted in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed by the work of Wilhelm Wundt. Durkheim&#x27;s articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the University of Bordeaux in 1887, where he was to teach the university&#x27;s first social science course. His official title was , thus he taught both pedagogy and sociology (the latter having never been taught in France before). The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of changing times and the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences. From this position Durkheim helped reform the French school system, introducing the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.

Also in 1887, Durkheim married Louise Dreyfus. They had two children, Marie and André.

The 1890s were a period of remarkable creative output for Durkheim. In 1893, he published &quot;The Division of Labour in Society&quot;, his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement of the nature of human society and its development. Durkheim&#x27;s interest in social phenomena was spurred on by politics. France&#x27;s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the fall of the regime of Napoleon III, which was then replaced by the Third Republic. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France&#x27;s fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The Dreyfus affair of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.

In 1895, he published &quot;The Rules of Sociological Method&quot;, a manifesto stating what sociology is and how it ought to be done, and founded the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux. In 1898, he founded &quot;L&#x27;Année sociologique&quot;, the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, he published &quot;Suicide&quot;, a case study that provided an example of what a sociological monograph might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of quantitative methods in criminology, which he used in his study of suicide.

By 1902, Durkheim had finally achieved his goal of attaining a prominent position in Paris when he became the chair of education at the Sorbonne. Durkheim had aimed for the position earlier, but the Parisian faculty took longer to accept what some called &quot;sociological imperialism&quot; and admit social science to their curriculum. He became a full professor (specifically, Professor of the Science of Education) there in 1906, and in 1913 he was named chair in &quot;Education and Sociology&quot;. Because French universities are technically institutions for training secondary school teachers, this position gave Durkheim considerable influence—his lectures were the only ones that were mandatory for the entire student body. Durkheim had much influence over the new generation of teachers; around that time he also served as an advisor to the Ministry of Education. In 1912, he published his last major work, &quot;The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life&quot;.

==Death==
The outbreak of World War I was to have a tragic effect on Durkheim&#x27;s life. His leftism was always patriotic rather than internationalist, in that he sought a secular, rational form of French life. However, the onset of the war, and the inevitable nationalist propaganda that followed, made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position. While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war, his reluctance to give in to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant French Right. Even more seriously, the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army, many of them perishing in the trenches.

Finally, Durkheim&#x27;s own son, André, died on the war front in December 1915—a loss from which Durkheim never recovered. Emotionally devastated, Durkheim collapsed of a stroke in Paris two years later, on 15 November 1917. He was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.

==Methodology==

In &quot;The Rules of Sociological Method&quot; (1895), Durkheim expressed his desire to establish a method that would guarantee sociology&#x27;s truly scientific character. One of the questions raised concerns the objectivity of the sociologist: how may one study an object that, from the very beginning, conditions and relates to the observer? According to Durkheim, observation must be as impartial and impersonal as possible, even though a &quot;perfectly objective observation&quot; in this sense may never be attained. A social fact must always be studied according to its relation with other social facts, never according to the individual who studies it. Sociology should therefore privilege comparison rather than the study of singular independent facts.

Durkheim sought to create one of the first rigorous scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with Herbert Spencer, he was one of the first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society through referencing what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society &quot;work&quot;). He also agreed with Spencer&#x27;s organic analogy, comparing society to a living organism. As a result, his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to functionalism. Durkheim also insisted that society was more than the sum of its parts.

Unlike his contemporaries Ferdinand Tönnies and Max Weber, he did not focus on what motivates individuals&#x27; actions (an approach associated with methodological individualism), but rather on the study of &quot;social facts&quot;.

==Inspirations==
During his university studies at the ENS, Durkheim was influenced by two neo-Kantian scholars: Charles Renouvier and Émile Boutroux. The principles Durkheim absorbed from them included rationalism, scientific study of morality, anti-utilitarianism, and secular education. His methodology was influenced by Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a supporter of the scientific method.

=== Comte ===
A fundamental influence on Durkheim&#x27;s thought was the sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the scientific method found in the natural sciences to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis:

* First, he accepted that the study of society was to be founded on an examination of facts. 
* Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. 
* Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions.

=== Realism ===
A second influence on Durkheim&#x27;s view of society beyond Comte&#x27;s positivism was the epistemological outlook called &quot;social realism&quot;. Although he never explicitly espoused it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective in order to demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed in the form of the objective relations of society. As an epistemology of science, &quot;realism&quot; can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the individual&#x27;s perception of them.

This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as empiricism and positivism. Empiricists, like David Hume, had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception, thus all realities are merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves. Comte&#x27;s positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover &quot;apparent&quot; laws, but would be able to discover the &quot;inherent nature&quot; of society.

=== Judaism ===
Scholars also debate the exact influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim&#x27;s work. The answer remains uncertain; some scholars have argued that Durkheim&#x27;s thought is a form of secularized Jewish thought, while others argue that proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim&#x27;s achievements is difficult or impossible.

==Durkheim and theory==
Throughout his career, Durkheim was concerned primarily with three goals. First, to establish sociology as a new academic discipline. Second, to analyse how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in the modern era, when things such as shared religious and ethnic background could no longer be assumed. To that end he wrote much about the effect of laws, religion, education and similar forces on society and social integration. Lastly, Durkheim was concerned with the practical implications of scientific knowledge. The importance of social integration is expressed throughout Durkheim&#x27;s work:

===Establishing sociology===
Durkheim authored some of the most programmatic statements on what sociology is and how it should be practiced. His concern was to establish sociology as a science. Arguing for a place for sociology among other sciences, he wrote, &quot;sociology is, then, not an auxiliary of any other science; it is itself a distinct and autonomous science.&quot;

To give sociology a place in the academic world and to ensure that it is a legitimate science, it must have an object that is clear and distinct from philosophy or psychology, and its own methodology. He argued that &quot;there is in every society a certain group of phenomena which may be differentiated from those studied by the other natural sciences.&quot;

In the Tarde-Durkheim debate of 1903, the &quot;anthropological view&quot; of Gabriel Tarde was ridiculed and hastily dismissed.

A fundamental aim of sociology is to discover structural &quot;social facts&quot;. The establishment of sociology as an independent, recognized academic discipline is among Durkheim&#x27;s largest and most lasting legacies. Within sociology, his work has significantly influenced structuralism or structural functionalism.

===Social facts===


Durkheim&#x27;s work revolved around the study of social facts, a term he coined to describe phenomena that have an existence in and of themselves, are not bound to the actions of individuals, but have a coercive influence upon them. Durkheim argued that social facts have, &quot;sui generis&quot;, an independent existence greater and more objective than the actions of the individuals that compose society. Only such social facts can explain the observed social phenomena. Being exterior to the individual person, social facts may thus also exercise coercive power on the various people composing society, as it can sometimes be observed in the case of formal laws and regulations, but also in situations implying the presence of informal rules, such as religious rituals or family norms. Unlike the facts studied in natural sciences, a &quot;social&quot; fact thus refers to a specific category of phenomena: &quot;the determining cause of a social fact must be sought among the antecedent social facts and not among the states of the individual consciousness.&quot;

Such facts are endowed with a power of coercion, by reason of which they may control individual behaviors. According to Durkheim, these phenomena cannot be reduced to biological or psychological grounds. Social facts can be material (i.e. physical objects ) or immaterial (i.e. meanings, sentiments, etc.). Though the latter cannot be seen or touched, they are external and coercive, thus becoming real and gaining &quot;facticity&quot;. Physical objects, too, can represent both material and immaterial social facts. For example, a flag is a physical social fact that is often ingrained with various immaterial social facts (e.g. its meaning and importance).

Many social facts, however, have no material form. Even the most &quot;individualistic&quot; or &quot;subjective&quot; phenomena, such as love, freedom, or suicide, were regarded by Durkheim as &quot;objective&quot; social facts. Individuals composing society do not directly cause suicide: suicide, as a social fact, exists independently in society, and is caused by other social facts—such as rules governing behavior and group attachment—whether an individual likes it or not. Whether a person &quot;leaves&quot; a society does not alter the &quot;fact&quot; that this society will &quot;still contain&quot; suicides. Suicide, like other immaterial social facts, exists independently of the will of an individual, cannot be eliminated, and is as influential—coercive—as physical laws like gravity. Sociology&#x27;s task therefore consists of discovering the qualities and characteristics of such social facts, which can be discovered through a quantitative or experimental approach (Durkheim extensively relied on statistics).

===Society, collective consciousness, and culture===
Regarding the society itself, like social institutions in general, Durkheim saw it as a set of social facts. Even more than &quot;what society is,&quot; Durkheim was interested in answering &quot;how is a society created&quot; and &quot;what holds a society together.&quot; In &quot;The Division of Labour in Society&quot;, Durkheim attempts to answer the latter question.

==== Collective consciousness ====
Durkheim assumes that humans are inherently egoistic, while &quot;collective consciousness&quot; (i.e. norms, beliefs, and values) forms the moral basis of the society, resulting in social integration. &quot;Collective consciousness&quot; is therefore of key importance to the society; its requisite function without which the society cannot survive. This consciousness produces the society and holds it together, while, at the same time, individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions. Through collective consciousness human beings become aware of one another as social beings, not just animals.The totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members of a society forms a determinate system with a life of its own. It can be termed the collective or common consciousness.In particular, the emotional part of the collective consciousness overrides our egoism: as we are emotionally bound to culture, we act socially because we recognize it is the responsible, moral way to act. A key to forming society is social interaction, and Durkheim believes that human beings, when in a group, will inevitably act in such a way that a society is formed.

==== Culture ====
Groups, when interacting, create their own culture and attach powerful emotions to it, thus making &quot;culture&quot; another key social fact. Durkheim was one of the first scholars to consider the question of culture so intensely. Durkheim was interested in cultural diversity, and how the existence of diversity nonetheless fails to destroy a society. To that, Durkheim answered that any apparent cultural diversity is overridden by a larger, common, and more generalized cultural system, and the law.

In a socio-evolutionary approach, Durkheim described the evolution of societies from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity (one rising from mutual need). As societies become more complex, evolving from mechanical to organic solidarity, the division of labour is counteracting and replacing to collective consciousness. In the simpler societies, people are connected to others due to personal ties and traditions; in the larger, modern society they are connected due to increased reliance on others with regard to them performing their specialized tasks needed for the modern, highly complex society to survive. In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration, and thus there is the need for use of force and repression to keep society together. Also, in such societies, people have much fewer options in life. In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent, and specialization and cooperation are extensive. Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on population growth and increasing population density, second on increasing &quot;morality density&quot; (development of more complex social interactions) and thirdly, on the increasing specialization in workplace. One of the ways mechanical and organic societies differ is the function of law: in mechanical society the law is focused on its punitive aspect, and aims to reinforce the cohesion of the community, often by making the punishment public and extreme; whereas in the organic society the law focuses on repairing the damage done and is more focused on individuals than the community.

One of the main features of the modern, organic society is the importance, sacredness even, given to the concept—social fact—of the individual. The individual, rather than the collective, becomes the focus of rights and responsibilities, the center of public and private rituals holding the society together—a function once performed by the religion. To stress the importance of this concept, Durkheim talked of the &quot;cult of the individual&quot;:Thus very far from there being the antagonism between the individual and society which is often claimed, moral individualism, the cult of the individual, is in fact the product of society itself. It is society that instituted it and made of man the god whose servant it is.Durkheim saw the population density and growth as key factors in the evolution of the societies and advent of modernity. As the number of people in a given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour. In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.

In another example of evolution of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between lower classes and upper classes, but because lower classes want to look like the upper classes, they will eventually adapt the upper class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the upper class to adopt a new fashion.

===Social pathology and crime===

As the society, Durkheim noted there are several possible pathologies that could lead to a breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are &quot;anomie&quot; and &quot;forced division of labour&quot;; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide. To Durkheim, &quot;anomie&quot; refers to a lack of social norms; where too rapid of population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (i.e. norms, values, etc.). &quot;Forced division of labour&quot;, on the other hand, refers to a situation in which those who hold power, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing work that they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.

Durkheim&#x27;s views on crime were a departure from conventional notions. He believed that crime is &quot;bound up with the fundamental conditions of all social life&quot; and serves a social function. He states that crime implies &quot;not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes.&quot; Examining the trial of Socrates, he argues that &quot;his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country&quot; as &quot;it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed.&quot; As such, his crime &quot;was a useful prelude to reforms.&quot; In this sense, he saw crime as being able to release certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society. 

The authority which the moral conscience enjoys must not be excessive; otherwise, no-one would dare to criticize it, and it would too easily congeal into an immutable form. To make progress, individual originality must be able to express itself…[even] the originality of the criminal…shall also be possible. 

==== Deviance ====
Durkheim thought deviance to be an essential component of a functional society. He believed that deviance had three possible effects on society:

# Deviance challenges the perspective and thoughts of the general population, leading to social change by pointing out a flaw in society.
# Deviant acts may support existing social norms and beliefs by evoking the population to discipline the actors.
# Reactions to deviant activity could increase camaraderie and social support among the population affected by the activity.

Durkheim&#x27;s thoughts on deviance contributed to Robert Merton&#x27;s Strain Theory.

====Suicide====
In &quot;Suicide&quot; (1897), Durkheim explores the differing suicide rates among Protestants and Catholics, arguing that stronger social control among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of integration while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated suicide as a social fact, explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals&#x27; feelings and motivations.

Durkheim believed there was more to suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances such as loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, Durkheim explained suicide as a symptom of collective social deviance, like alcoholism or homicide.

He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. Proposing four different types of suicide, which include &quot;egoistic&quot;, &quot;altruistic&quot;, &quot;anomic&quot;, and &quot;fatalistic&quot;, Durkheim began his theory by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis:

* &quot;Egoistic suicide&quot; corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that they have not made a difference in anyone&#x27;s lives. 
* &quot;Altruistic suicide&quot; corresponds to too much social integration. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. 
* &quot;Anomic suicide&quot; occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term &quot;anomie&quot;, meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. 
* &quot;Fatalistic suicide&quot; results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to a belief that there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.

This study has been extensively discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably Adolph Wagner and Henry Morselli, who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant–Catholic differences in suicide seemed to be limited to German-speaking Europe and thus may have always been the spurious reflection of other factors. Durkheim&#x27;s study of suicide has been criticized as an example of the logical error termed the ecological fallacy. However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim&#x27;s work really contained an ecological fallacy. More recent authors such as Berk (2006) have also questioned the micro–macro relations underlying Durkheim&#x27;s work. Some, such as Inkeles (1959), Johnson (1965), and Gibbs (1968), have claimed that Durkheim&#x27;s only intent was to explain suicide &quot;sociologically&quot; within a holistic perspective, emphasizing that &quot;he intended his theory to explain variation among social environments in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals.&quot;

Despite its limitations, Durkheim&#x27;s work on suicide has influenced proponents of control theory, and is often mentioned as a classic sociological study. The book pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy.

===Religion===
In &quot;The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life&quot; (1912), Durkheim&#x27;s first purpose was to identify the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion was a source of camaraderie and solidarity. His second purpose was to identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of spirituality and God.

Durkheim defined &quot;religion&quot; as: &quot;a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, i.e., things set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite in one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them.&quot;In this definition, Durkheim avoids references to supernatural or God. Durkheim rejected earlier definitions by Tylor that religion was &quot;belief in supernatural beings,&quot; finding that primitive societies such as the Australian aborigines (following the ethnologies of Spencer and Gillen, largely discredited later) did not divide reality into &quot;natural&quot; vs. &quot;supernatural&quot; realms, but rather into realms of the &quot;sacred&quot; and the &quot;profane,&quot; which were not moral categories, since both could include what was good or evil. Durkheim argues we are left with the following three concepts:

* The sacred: ideas and sentiments kindled by the spectacle of society and which inspire awe, spiritual devotion or respect;
* The beliefs &amp; practices: creating an emotional state of &quot;collective effervescence&quot;, investing symbols with sacred importance;
* The moral community: a group of people sharing a common moral philosophy.

Out of those three concepts, Durkheim focused on the sacred, noting that it is at the very core of a religion:They are only collective forces hypostasized, that is to say, moral forces; they are made up of the ideas and sentiments awakened in us by the spectacle of society, and not of sensations coming from the physical world.Durkheim saw religion as the most fundamental social institution of humankind, and one that gave rise to other social forms. It was religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of collective consciousness. Durkheim saw religion as a force that emerged in the early hunter-gatherer societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them. Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.Thus there is something eternal in religion which is destined to survive all the particular symbols in which religious thought has successively enveloped itself.However, even if the religion was losing its importance for Durkheim, it still laid the foundation of modern society and the interactions that governed it. And despite the advent of alternative forces, Durkheim argued that no replacement for the force of religion had yet been created. He expressed his doubt about modernity, seeing the modern times as &quot;a period of transition and moral mediocrity.&quot;

Durkheim also argued that our primary categories for understanding the world have their origins in religion. It is religion, Durkheim writes, that gave rise to most if not all other social constructs, including the larger society. Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations. Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual&#x27;s experience. In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing categories as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience. Our understanding of the world is shaped by social facts; for example the notion of time is defined by being measured through a calendar, which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion. In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion. Durkheim states that, &quot;Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.&quot;

In his work, Durkheim focused on &quot;totemism&quot;, the religion of the Aboriginal Australians and Native Americans. Durkheim saw this religion as the most ancient religion, and focused on it as he believed its simplicity would ease the discussion of the essential elements of religion. As such, he wrote:Now the totem is the flag of the clan. It is therefore natural that the impressions aroused by the clan in individual minds—impressions of dependence and of increased vitality—should fix themselves to the idea of the totem rather than that of the clan: for the clan is too complex a reality to be represented clearly in all its complex unity by such rudimentary intelligences.Durkheim&#x27;s work on religion was criticized on both empirical and theoretical grounds by specialists in the field. The most important critique came from Durkheim&#x27;s contemporary, Arnold van Gennep, an expert on religion and ritual, and also on Australian belief systems. Van Gennep argued that Durkheim&#x27;s views of primitive peoples and simple societies were &quot;entirely erroneous&quot;. Van Gennep further argued that Durkheim demonstrated a lack of critical stance towards his sources, collected by traders and priests, naively accepting their veracity, and that Durkheim interpreted freely from dubious data. At the conceptual level, van Gennep pointed out Durkheim&#x27;s tendency to press ethnography into a prefabricated theoretical scheme.

Despite such critiques, Durkheim&#x27;s work on religion has been widely praised for its theoretical insight and whose arguments and propositions, according to Robert Alun Jones, &quot;have stimulated the interest and excitement of several generations of sociologists irrespective of theoretical &#x27;school&#x27; or field of specialization.&quot;

===Sociology of knowledge===

While Durkheim&#x27;s work deals with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, social structures, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge.

While publishing short articles on the subject earlier in his career, Durkheim&#x27;s definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;The Elementary Forms of Religious Life&quot;. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how the concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not &quot;a priori&quot;. Rather, the category of space depends on a society&#x27;s social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group&#x27;s social rhythm that determines our understanding of time. In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of rationalism and empiricism, arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the &quot;tabula rasa&quot; empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal &quot;a&quot; &quot;prioris&quot; (as Kant argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.

==== Collective representations ====
Another key elements to Durkheim&#x27;s theory of knowledge outlined in &quot;Elementary Forms&quot; is the concept of (&quot;collective representations&quot;). &#x27; are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, &#x27; are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such, these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual—since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole—yet, simultaneously within each individual of the society, by virtue of that individual&#x27;s participation within society.

Arguably the most important &quot;&quot; is language, which according to Durkheim is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating on their own:If concepts were only general ideas, they would not enrich knowledge a great deal, for, as we have already pointed out, the general contains nothing more than the particular. But if before all else they are collective representations, they add to that which we can learn by our own personal experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and transforms it.As such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality. This discursive approach to language and society was developed by later French philosophers, such as Michel Foucault.

=== Morality ===
Durkheim defines morality as &quot;a system of rules for conduct&quot;. His analysis of morality is influenced by Immanuel Kant and his notion of duty. While Durkheim was influenced by Kant, he was critical of aspects of the latter&#x27;s moral theory and developed his own positions.

Durkheim agrees with Kant that within morality, there is an element of obligation, &quot;a moral authority which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts particularly important to it, confers upon [moral rules] an obligatory character.&quot; Morality tells us how to act from a position of superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to which we must conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the categorical imperative. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but is also something that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common Good, and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.

However, in order to accomplish its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.

==Influence and legacy==

Durkheim has had an important impact on the development of anthropology and sociology as disciplines. The establishment of sociology as an independent, recognized academic discipline, in particular, is among Durkheim&#x27;s largest and most lasting legacies. Within sociology, his work has significantly influenced structuralism, or structural functionalism. Scholars inspired by Durkheim include Jonathan Haidt, Marcel Mauss, Maurice Halbwachs, Célestin Bouglé, Gustave Belot, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Talcott Parsons, Robert K. Merton, Jean Piaget, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Ferdinand de Saussure, Michel Foucault, Clifford Geertz, Peter Berger, social reformer Patrick Hunout, and others.

More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as Steven Lukes, Robert N. Bellah, and Pierre Bourdieu. His description of &quot;collective consciousness&quot; also influenced Ziya Gökalp, the founder of Turkish sociology who replaced Durkheim&#x27;s concept of society with nation. An ideologue who provided the intellectual justification for the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s wars of aggression and massive demographic engineering—including the Armenian genocide—he could be considered to pervert Durkheim&#x27;s ideas. Randall Collins has developed a theory of what he calls &quot;interaction ritual chains&quot;, a synthesis of Durkheim&#x27;s work on religion with that of Erving Goffman&#x27;s micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also influenced by Durkheim in his development of the &quot;interaction order&quot;.

Outside of sociology, Durkheim has influenced philosophers, including Henri Bergson and Emmanuel Levinas, and his ideas can be identified, inexplicitly, in the work of certain structuralist theorists of the 1960s, such as Alain Badiou, Louis Althusser, and Michel Foucault.

===Durkheim contra Searle===
Much of Durkheim&#x27;s work remains unacknowledged in philosophy, despite its direct relevance. As proof, one can look to John Searle, whose book, &quot;The Construction of Social Reality&quot;, elaborates a theory of social facts and collective representations that Searle believed to be a landmark work that would bridge the gap between analytic and continental philosophy. Neil Gross, however, demonstrates how Searle&#x27;s views on society are more or less a reconstitution of Durkheim&#x27;s theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations, and the like. Searle&#x27;s ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim&#x27;s. Searle responded by arguing that Durkheim&#x27;s work was worse than he had originally believed, and, admitting that he had not read much of Durkheim&#x27;s work: &quot;Because Durkheim&#x27;s account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work.&quot; Stephen Lukes, however, responded to Searle&#x27;s reply to Gross, refuting, point by point, the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding the argument of Gross, that Searle&#x27;s work bears great resemblance to that of Durkheim. Lukes attributes Searle&#x27;s miscomprehension of Durkheim&#x27;s work to the fact that Searle, quite simply, never read Durkheim.

===Gilbert pro Durkheim===
Margaret Gilbert, a contemporary British philosopher of social phenomena, has offered a close, sympathetic reading of Durkheim&#x27;s discussion of social facts in the first chapter and the prefaces of &quot;The Rules of Sociological Method&quot;. In her 1989 book, &quot;On Social Facts&quot;—the title of which may represent an homage to Durkheim, alluding to his &quot;&quot;—Gilbert argues that some of his statements that may seem to be philosophically untenable are important and fruitful.

<doc id="38219" wikidata="Q2284331" url="?curid=38219" title="Toilet humour">
<text>Toilet humour, potty humour or scatological humour (compare scatology), is a type of off-colour humour dealing with defecation (including diarrhea and constipation), urination and flatulence, and to a lesser extent vomiting and other bodily functions. 

Toilet humour is commonly an interest of toddlers and young children, for whom cultural taboos related to acknowledgement of waste excretion still have a degree of novelty. The humour comes from the rejection of such taboos, and is a part of modern culture.

==Music==
Toilet humour is sometimes found in song and rhyme, particularly schoolboy songs. Examples of this are found in Mozart and scatology, and variants of the German folk schoolboys&#x27; song known as the &quot;Scheiße-Lied&quot; (English: &quot;Shit-Song&quot;) which is indexed in the German &quot;Volksliederarchiv&quot;. A children&#x27;s Spanish musical duo, Enrique y Ana, made a song called &quot;Caca Culo Pedo Pis&quot;, which literally translates to &quot;Poop Butt Fart Pee&quot;.

American musician Matt Farley is known for writing and performing a multitude of songs related to urine, feces, vomit and various other bodily fluids under the pseudonym &quot;The Toilet Bowl Cleaners&quot;, including one of his most popular songs, entitled &quot;Poop in My Fingernails&quot;. Farley has another pseudonym, &quot;The Odd Man Who Sings About Poop, Puke, and Pee&quot;. Many of his songs are just a person&#x27;s name alternating with the word &quot;poop&quot;. Other songs include &quot;I Need a Lot of Toilet Paper to Clean the Poop in My Butt&quot;.

Detroit rapper Eminem famously utilises crude humour throughout his discography. His most notorious example of toilet humour was featured on the 2017 album &quot;Revival&quot;, where he raps &quot;Your booty is heavy duty, like diarrhea&quot;, a line which received extensive lament from critics. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; comments: &quot;If Hannibal Lecter could have recorded a rap album, this would have been it. Brilliant, sinister, scatological and a parent&#x27;s nightmare.&quot;

==Performance==
Paul Oldfield, who performed under the name Mr. Methane, performed a stage act that included him farting the notes of music. Joseph Pujol, who performed under the name Le Pétomane (French for &quot;fart maniac&quot;), performed a similar stage act for the Paris music hall scene.

The American comedy duo Tim &amp; Eric have made numerous comedy sketches based around toilet humour. For example, they have made fake commercials for non-existent products such as the &quot;Poop Tube&quot; (a device that lets people release liquefied faecal matter into a urinal while standing up), the &quot;fla&#x27;Hat&quot; (a hat that is connected to the wearer&#x27;s anus which expands when storing flatulence), and &quot;D-Pants&quot; (an undergarment invented by &quot;Diah Riha-Jones&quot; that captures &quot;uncontrollable diarrhea&quot;).

In the series &quot;South Park&quot;, the Canadian comedy duo Terrance and Phillip are noted for toilet humor and often make comedic use of their flatulence e.g. in the song ‘Unclefucker’.

English actor Adrian Edmondson, who appeared in many shows utilising toilet humour, is quoted as saying, &quot;Toilet humour is like jazz: everybody has an idea what it is, and most people don&#x27;t like it. But the people who do like it are fervent about it and like it until they die.&quot;

==Books==
In 1929 comedian Charles &quot;Chic&quot; Sale published a small book, &quot;The Specialist&quot;, which was a large &quot;underground&quot; success. Its entire premise centered on sales of outhouses, touting the advantages of one kind or another, and labeling them in &quot;technical&quot; terms such as &quot;one-holers&quot;, &quot;two-holers&quot;, etc. Over a million copies were sold. In 1931 his monologue &quot;I&#x27;m a Specialist&quot; was made into a hit record (Victor 22859) by recording artist Frank Crumit (music by Nels Bitterman). As memorialized in the &quot;Outhouse Wall of Fame&quot;, the term &quot;Chic Sale&quot; became a rural slang synonym for privies, an appropriation of Mr. Sale&#x27;s name that he personally considered unfortunate.

More recently, one of the most popular books about defecation, diarrhea and accidents in toilets is by straight-talking physician Jane Wilson-Howarth, a guide that began as &quot;Shitting Pretty&quot; and then was relaunched as &quot;How to Shit around the World&quot;.

The children&#x27;s book series &quot;Captain Underpants&quot; makes copious use of toilet humor. &quot;Doctor Diaper&quot;, &quot;The Bionic Booger Boy&quot;, and &quot;Professor Pippy Pee-Pee Poopypants&quot; are among the villains in the series.

==Video games==
A game notorious for its juvenile humour, &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; contains a plentiful amount of scatological jokes. One of the landmark areas is a &quot;Poo Mountain&quot; and some of its missions involve getting cows to drink a laxative prune juice to produce &quot;pooballs&quot;, or fighting The Great Mighty Poo, a giant opera-singing pile of feces as a boss. In a later mission, the game&#x27;s protagonist also has urination as an attack, after drinking a lot of beer and getting drunk.

Toilet humour is also versatile in the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; franchise. Solid Snake can protect himself from wolf attacks by having one urinate on him. In &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, Solid Snake can spot soldiers relieving themselves several times and also stand under them. In &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;, Raiden is instructed in order to use a terminal, he first needs to &quot;take a DOOMP&quot;, which is an abbreviation for &quot;digital-optical output mounted proxy&quot;.

A trait of Wario from the eponymous spin-off franchise is a powerful flatulence attack extensively used in his &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; appearance.

==Toys==
The Moose Toys franchise Little Live &quot;Gotta Go&quot; Pets is a toy line of interactive plush animals that &quot;poop&quot; when fed colourful sand. The toys make graphic noises of passing gas, panic and say the words &quot;uh-oh! Gotta go!&quot; and have scatological names including &quot;turdle&quot; (turtle). The internet critic Doug Walker called the toys &quot;disgusting&quot; and found them immature and inappropriate. Parenting blogs praised the toy line for its crude humour approach to potty training.

Mattel fashion doll Barbie has a plastic golden retriever, named Tanner, which has been an available toy in different variations since the 1990s. Tanner the dog eats brown bean-like beads and then poops them out when its tail is pressed. Barbie can then pick up the plastic poop with a scooper that comes with the playsets.

Infant dolls, typically targeted towards little girls, have existed for decades that urinate and defecate (into diapers or potties) as a play feature. Variants include &quot;Magic Potty Baby&quot; (a 1990s Tyco brand doll) and &quot;Baby Alive&quot; (and Amazon knock-off counterfeit variants) that pee, poop and release glitter from their rear ends. The trend of scatological dolls for girls was mocked on the 1970s British comedy TV series &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; in the episode &quot;A Change Is as Good as a Rest&quot;; salesman Mr. Lucas fills Ms. Brahms&#x27;s peeing dollies with fizzy carbonated lemonade; another gag features character Mrs. Slocombe displaying two doll variants to a customer: the one manufactured in Britain is blonde-haired and says &quot;I want to go to the potty&quot; when a string on its back is pulled, while a similar doll with sandy hair manufactured in India says &quot;my name is Yasmin, and I have just &quot;been&quot; to the potty&quot; when its string is pulled.

<doc id="38221" wikidata="Q519" url="?curid=38221" title="Shit">
<text>Shit is an English-language profanity. As a noun, it refers to fecal matter, and as a verb it means to defecate; in the plural (&quot;the shits&quot;), it means diarrhea. Shite is a common variant in British and Irish English. As a slang term, &quot;shit&quot; has many meanings, including: nonsense, foolishness, something of little value or quality, trivial and usually boastful or inaccurate talk or a contemptible person. It could also be used to refer to any other noun in general or as an expression of annoyance, surprise or anger.

==Etymology==
The word is likely derived from Old English, having the nouns &quot;scite&quot; (dung, attested only in place names) and &quot;scitte&quot; (diarrhoea) and the verb &quot;scītan&quot; (to defecate, attested only in &quot;bescītan&quot;, to cover with excrement); eventually it morphed into Middle English &quot;schītte&quot; (excrement), &quot;schyt&quot; (diarrhoea) and &quot;shiten&quot; (to defecate), and it is virtually certain that it was used in some form by preliterate Germanic tribes at the time of the Roman Empire. The word may be further traced to Proto-Germanic *&quot;skit&quot;-, and ultimately to Proto-Indo-European *&quot;skheid&quot;- &quot;cut, separate&quot;, the same root believed to have become the word &quot;&quot;. The word has several cognates in modern Germanic languages, such as German &quot;Scheiße&quot;, Dutch &quot;schijt&quot;, Swedish &quot;skit&quot;, Icelandic &quot;skítur&quot;, Norwegian &quot;skitt&quot; etc. Ancient Greek had &#x27;skōr&#x27; (gen. &#x27;skatos&#x27; hence &#x27;scato-&#x27;), from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;sker&quot;-, which is likely unrelated.

==Usage==
The word &quot;shit&quot; (also &quot;shite&quot; in British and Hiberno-English) is considered profanity and is usually avoided in formal speech. Minced oath substitutes for the word &quot;shit&quot; in English include &quot;shoot&quot;, &quot;shucks&quot;, &quot;sugar&quot;, and the euphemistic backronym, &quot;Sugar, Honey, Ice(d) Tea&quot;.

In the word&#x27;s literal sense, it has a rather small range of common usages. An unspecified or collective occurrence of feces is generally &quot;shit&quot; or &quot;some shit&quot;; a single deposit of feces is sometimes &quot;a shit&quot; or &quot;a piece of shit&quot;; and to defecate is &quot;to shit&quot; or &quot;to take a shit&quot;. While it is common to speak of shit as existing in &quot;a pile&quot;, &quot;a load&quot;, &quot;a hunk&quot;, and other quantities and configurations, such expressions flourish most strongly in the figurative.

When uttered as an exclamation or interjection, &quot;shit&quot; may convey astonishment or a feeling of being favorably impressed or disgusted. Similar utterances might be &quot;damn!&quot;, &quot;wow!&quot; or &quot;yuck!&quot;.

&quot;Piece of shit&quot; may also be used figuratively to describe a particularly loathsome individual, or an object that is of poor quality (&quot;this car is a &quot;piece of shit&quot;&quot;, often abbreviated to &quot;P.O.S.&quot;).

One study published in 2017 argued that &quot;shit studies&quot; is a cross-disciplinary meta-field of rhetorical inquiry about human communication and reasoning. The authors explained, &quot;rhetorical studies has theorized &#x27;shit&#x27; in terms of the communication of transformation, style, and textual relations,&quot; particularly in relation to claims of expertise to topics such as &quot;anti-semitism&quot; and &quot;wine-tasting.&quot; They conclude that bullshit speech is one-sided discourse that is difficult to penetrate because it contains &quot;ideological barriers to the expectation of mutuality,&quot; working to deflect critical responses.

===Vague noun===
&quot;Shit&quot; can be used as a generic mass noun similar to &quot;stuff&quot;; for instance, &quot;This show is funny (as) shit&quot; or &quot;This test is hard (as) shit&quot;, or &quot;That was stupid shit&quot;. These three usages (with &quot;funny&quot;, &quot;hard&quot;, and &quot;stupid&quot; or another synonym of &quot;stupid&quot;) are heard most commonly in the United States. Using &quot;as&quot; denotes a subtle change in the meaning of the expression; however, the overall intent is basically the same.

In the expression &quot;Get your shit together!&quot;, the word &quot;shit&quot; can refer either to one&#x27;s wits or composure or to one&#x27;s things, gear, etc. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t have his shit together&quot; means that his affairs are disordered, reflecting not bad luck or forces beyond his control, but his personal shortcomings.

To &quot;shoot the shit&quot; is to have a friendly but pointless conversation, as in &quot;Come by my place some time and we&#x27;ll shoot the shit.&quot;

A &quot;shithole&quot; is any unpleasant place to be, much like a hellhole. This usage originates from a reference to a pit toilet.

A &quot;&quot; is something (a situation, explanation, argument, etc.) that is nonsense or fabricated as a deception or evasion; i.e. bullshit. Often abbreviated simply as &quot;crock&quot;. Example: &quot;You expect me to believe that ?? What a crock!&quot;

The phrase &quot;built like a brick shithouse&quot; is used in the United States to compliment a curvaceous woman, but in other English-speaking countries to compliment men with athletic physiques. This meaning originates from the observation that most shithouses are rather ramshackle affairs constructed of plywood or scrap sheets of steel.

&quot;The shitter&quot; is a slang term for a toilet, and can be used like the phrase &quot;...down the toilet&quot; to suggest that something has been wasted. Example: &quot;This CD player quit working one friggin&#x27; week after I bought it, and I lost the receipt! Twenty bucks right down the shitter!&quot;

&quot;Shit on a shingle&quot; is U.S. military slang for creamed chipped beef on toast. In polite company, this can be abbreviated as &quot;SOS&quot;.

===Trouble===
&quot;Shit&quot; can be used to denote trouble, by saying one is in &quot;a lot of shit&quot; or &quot;deep shit&quot; (a common euphemism is &quot;deep doo-doo&quot;). A &quot;shitstorm&quot; would be quite a lot of trouble happening all in one place at one time. It&#x27;s common for someone to refer to an unpleasant thing as &quot;hard shit&quot; (&quot;You got a speeding ticket? Man, that&#x27;s some hard shit&quot;), but the phrase &quot;tough shit&quot; is used as an unsympathetic way of saying &quot;too bad&quot; to whoever is having problems (&quot;You got arrested? Tough shit, man!&quot;) or as a way of expressing to someone that they need to stop complaining about something and cope with it instead (Billy: &quot;I got arrested because of you!&quot; Tommy: &quot;Tough shit, dude, you knew you might get arrested when you chose to come with me.&quot;) Note that in this case, as in many cases with the term, &quot;tough shit&quot; is often said as a way of pointing out someone&#x27;s fault in his/her own current problem. It&#x27;s also common to express annoyance by simply saying &quot;Shit&quot;.

A &quot;&quot; of something is a large quantity, especially something unpleasant or disgusting. &quot;The boss dumped a shitload of extra work for me this week.&quot; A &quot;&quot; is something (like a situation or state of affairs) unpleasant made triflingly more palatable by packaging it in things less unpleasant, as rotten meat sandwiched in bread. The term shit sandwich originates from an old joke that goes: &quot;Life is a shit sandwich. The more bread (money) you got, the less shit you have to eat.&quot;

&quot;Up shit creek&quot; or especially &quot;Up shit creek without a paddle&quot; describes a situation in which one is in severe difficulties with no apparent means of solution (this is simply a profane version of the older saying &quot;up the creek without a paddle&quot;, profanity added for emphasis or humor).

&quot;Shit happens&quot; means that bad happenings in life are inevitable. This is usually spoken with a sigh or a shrug, but can be spoken derisively to someone who complains too often about his ill fortunes, or in an irritating manner.

&quot;When the shit hits the fan&quot; is usually used to refer to a specific time of confrontation or trouble, which requires decisive action. This is often used in reference to combat situations and the action scenes in movies, but can also be used for everyday instances that one might be apprehensive about. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be here when the shit hits the fan!&quot; indicates that the speaker is dreading this moment (which can be anything from an enemy attack to confronting an angry parent or friend). In polite society, it is often reduced to &quot;when it hits the fan&quot;. &quot;He&#x27;s the one to turn to when the shit hits the fan&quot; is an indication that the person being talked about is dependable and will not run from trouble or abandon their allies in tough situations. The concept of this phrase is simple enough, as the actual substance striking the rotating blades of a fan would cause a messy and unpleasant situation (much like being in the presence of a manure spreader). Whether or not this has actually happened, or if the concept is simply feasible enough for most people to imagine the result without needing it to be demonstrated, is unknown. Another example might be the saying &quot;shit rolls downhill&quot;, a metaphor suggesting that trouble for a manager may be transferred to the subordinates. There are a number of anecdotes and jokes about such situations, as the imagery of these situations is considered to be funny. This is generally tied-in with the concept that disgusting and messy substances spilled onto someone else are humorous.

For someone to be described as &quot;shitfaced&quot; means that person is essentially incapacitated by alcoholic intoxication (i.e. in a thoroughly drunken state).

===Displeasure===
&quot;Shit&quot; can comfortably stand in for the terms &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;anything&quot; in many instances (&quot;Dinner was good, but the movie was shit.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re all mad at me, but I didn&#x27;t do shit!&quot;). A comparison can also be used, as in &quot;Those pants look like shit&quot;, or &quot;This stuff tastes like shit&quot;. Many usages are idiomatic. &quot;I&#x27;m shit out of luck&quot; usually refers to someone who is at the end of their wits or who has no remaining viable options. In polite company the acronym &quot;SOL&quot; is commonly substituted for this. &quot;That little shit shot me in the ass&quot;, suggests a mischievous or contemptuous person. Euphemisms such as &quot;crap&quot; are not usually used in this context.

The exclamations &quot;oh shit!&quot; and &quot;aw shit!&quot; are used to express displeasure or embarrassment (sometimes facetiously) with oneself when one makes a mistake, especially a stupid or avoidable mistake. When used to comment on the actions of someone else, they can take on a more humorous quality if the mistake does not result in serious consequences. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; is also a reflexive expression of horror or terror, as when witnessing or being involved in a life-threatening situation (for example, a vehicle accident).

The term &quot;piece of shit&quot; is generally used to classify a product or service as being sufficiently below the writer&#x27;s understanding of generally accepted quality standards to be of negligible and perhaps even negative value. The term &quot;piece of shit&quot; has greater precision than &quot;shit&quot; or &quot;shitty&quot; in that &quot;piece of shit&quot; identifies the low quality of a specific component or output of a process without applying a derogatory slant to the entire process. For example, if one said &quot;The youth orchestra has been a remarkably successful initiative. The fact that the orchestra&#x27;s recent rendition of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Manfred Symphony in B minor was pretty much a piece of shit should not in any way detract from this.&quot; The substitution of &quot;shit&quot; or &quot;shitty&quot; for &quot;pretty much a piece of shit&quot; would imply irony and would therefore undermine the strength of the statement.

The phrase &quot;(I don&#x27;t) give a shit&quot; can be used when one does not care about something, or has a passive attitude toward said thing, as it denotes indifference. In context, one can say: &quot;You&#x27;re offended? Well, I don&#x27;t give a shit!&quot; or &quot;You&#x27;re telling me? Go find somebody who gives a shit.&quot; President Richard Nixon said to aide H.R. Haldeman while being tape recorded in the Oval Office, &quot;I don&#x27;t give a shit about the lira.&quot; He meant he was too busy managing the Watergate affair to consider a crisis in the Italian monetary system.

The &quot;shit list&quot; is a category of people who are in ill favor with some individual or group of people, perhaps as the managers of a company, and likely to be the targets of special treatment.

The phrase &quot;take shit&quot; means to receive bad or frivolous treatment from someone. Such an abused person might say &quot;I&#x27;m not taking any more of your shit!&quot; to indicate that they will no longer tolerate such treatment.

&quot;Whale shit&quot; is sometimes used to describe a person who inspires displeasure or disgust, as in: &quot;You&#x27;re lower than whale shit at the bottom of the ocean!&quot;

“You can’t polish shit” is a popular aphorism roughly equivalent to &quot;putting Lipstick on a pig&quot; (although &quot;a turd&quot; is more commonly used). However, the TV show &quot;Mythbusters&quot; showed that a person can, in fact, polish a turd.

===Dominance===
&quot;Shit&quot; can also be used to establish social superiority over someone else. The most common gibe is &quot;eat shit!&quot; (cf &quot;coprophagy&quot;) expressing contempt. Some other personal word may be added such as &quot;eat my shit&quot; implying truly personal connotations. As an aside, the above is actually a contraction of the phrase &quot;eat shit and die!&quot;. It is often said without commas as a curse; they command the other party to perform exactly those actions in that order. However, the term was originally &quot;Eat, Shit, and Die&quot; naming the three most basic things humans have to do, and it is common among soldiers.

The phrase &quot;You ain&#x27;t shit&quot;, expresses an air of intimidation over the addressee, expressing that they mean nothing or are worthless.

&quot;Hot shit&quot; can be a reference to a matter or thing of supreme importance or urgency (&quot;This report is really hot shit!&quot;). It can be used in adjectival form: &quot;This memo&#x27;s shit-hot!&quot;. &quot;Hot shit&quot; can also refer to a person who either overestimates his own worth or ability, or is highly estimated by others (&quot;He thinks he&#x27;s some hot shit!&quot; or &quot;He&#x27;s one hot shit!&quot;). In polite company the euphemism &quot;hotshot&quot; may be substituted when referring to a person.

A speaker may show dominance through arrogance using the phrase &quot;His shit don&#x27;t stink&quot;. Its grammatical incorrectness highlights the self-importance of the referent relative to the speaker; though &quot;His shit does not stink&quot; may come across as being more emphatic due to the mixed diction between its grammatical correctness and the vulgarity of &quot;shit&quot;. This phrase conveys the haughtiness of the referent and that he considers himself beyond reproach. For example: &quot;Those pompous assholes in Finance are the ones who ruined the company – their shit don&#x27;t even stink!&quot; A variation on this theme might be: &quot;Everything he shits smells just like roses!&quot;

The expression &quot;&quot; can be used as a pejorative for a menial worker or other low class person. `within the world of (ii) a performer or fan of country-and-western music. The term shitkicker may be substituted with the less vulgar &quot;chipkicker&quot;, as in Lyle Lovett&#x27;s song &quot;Give back my heart&quot; on &quot;Pontiac&quot;, where a girl in a &quot;cowboy-looking bar&quot; is described as a &quot;chipkicker-redneck woman&quot;.

The word &quot;&quot; is a commonly heard insult. A shithead may also be referred to as a &quot;shit-for-brains&quot;. Another word for a spectacularly stupid (or contemptible) person is &quot;&quot;. Shithead is also the name of a card game.

===Positive attitude===
In North American slang, prefixing the article &quot;the&quot; to &quot;shit&quot; gives it a completely opposite definition, meaning &quot;the best&quot;, as in, for example &quot;Altered Beast is the shit&quot;. Other slang words of the same meaning, such as &quot;crap&quot;, are not used in such locutions.

To wear a &quot;&quot; means the person wearing it may be displaying self-satisfaction, smugness, embarrassment, or mischief. It may also be a playful evasion, as a response to the query &quot;I&#x27;ll bet you drank the whole bottle of booze yourself, didn&#x27;t you?&quot;

===Shortening of &quot;bullshit&quot;===

The expression &quot;no shit?&quot; (a contraction of &quot;no bullshit?&quot;) is used in response to a statement that is extraordinary or hard to believe. Alternatively the maker of the hard-to-believe statement may add &quot;no shit&quot; to reinforce the sincerity or truthfulness of their statement, particularly in response to someone expressing disbelief at their statement. &quot;No shit&quot; is also used sarcastically in response to a statement of the obvious, as in &quot;no shit, Sherlock&quot;.

In this form the word can also be used in phrases such as &quot;don&#x27;t give me that shit&quot; or &quot;you&#x27;re full of shit&quot;. The term &quot;full of shit&quot; is often used as an exclamation to charge someone who is believed to be prone to dishonesty, exaggeration or is thought to be &quot;phoney&quot; with an accusation. For example:

# &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m sorry I forgot to invite you to the party, it was a complete accident... but you really didn&#x27;t miss anything anyway.&quot;
# &quot;You&#x27;re full of shit! You had dozens of opportunities to invite me. If you have a problem with me, why not just say it!&quot;

The word &quot;bullshit&quot; also denotes false or insincere discourse. (&quot;Horseshit&quot; is roughly equivalent, while &quot;chickenshit&quot; means &quot;cowardly&quot;, &quot;batshit&quot; indicates a person is crazy, and &quot;going apeshit&quot; indicates a person is entering a state of high excitement or unbridled rage.) &quot;Are you shitting me?!&quot; is a question sometimes given in response to an incredible assertion. An answer that reasserts the veracity of the claim is, &quot;I shit you not&quot;.

===Emphasis===
Perhaps the only constant connotation that &quot;shit&quot; reliably carries is that its referent holds some degree of emotional intensity for the speaker. Whether offense is taken at hearing the word varies greatly according to listener and situation, and is related to age and social class: elderly speakers and those of (or aspiring to) higher socioeconomic strata tend to use it more privately and selectively than younger and more blue-collar speakers.

Like the word &quot;fuck&quot;, &quot;shit&quot; is often used to add emphasis more than to add meaning, for example, &quot;shit! I was so shit-scared of that shithead that I shit-talked him into dropping out of the karate match!&quot; The term &quot;to shit-talk&quot; connotes bragging or exaggeration (whereas &quot;to talk shit&quot; primarily means &quot;to gossip [about someone in a damaging way]&quot; or to talk in a boastful way about things which are erroneous in nature), but in such constructions as the above, the word &quot;shit&quot; often functions as an interjection.

The exclamation &quot;holy shit&quot; derives its force from the juxtaposition of the sacred with the profane.

Unlike the word &quot;fuck&quot;, &quot;shit&quot; is not used emphatically with &quot;-ing&quot; or as an infix. For example; &quot;I lost the shitting karate match&quot; would be replaced with &quot;...thefucking karate match&quot;. Similarly, while &quot;in-fucking-credible&quot; is generally acceptable, &quot;in-shitting-credible&quot; is not.

===The verb &quot;to shit&quot;===
The preterite and past participle of &quot;shit&quot; are attested as &quot;shat&quot;, &quot;shit&quot;, or &quot;shitted&quot;, depending on dialect and, sometimes, the rhythm of the sentence. In the prologue of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, &quot;shitten&quot; is used as the past participle; however this form is not used in modern English. In American English &quot;shit&quot; as a past participle is often correct, while &quot;shat&quot; is generally acceptable and &quot;shitted&quot; is uncommon and missing from the &quot;Random House&quot; and &quot;American Heritage&quot; dictionaries.

====&quot;to shitcan&quot;====
To someone or something is to dismiss or dispose of casually or unceremoniously, as into a waste basket. Shitcan can also be used as a noun: &quot;Don&#x27;t bother; a report like this is gonna go directly into the shitcan.&quot; It can also refer to being fired from a job: &quot;The boss is gonna shitcan you if you keep showing up late.&quot;

===Backronyms===
The backronym form &quot;S.H.I.T.&quot; often figures into jokes, like &quot;Special High Intensity Training&quot; (a well-known joke used in job applications), &quot;Special Hot Interdiction Team&quot; (a mockery on SWAT), any college name that begins with an S-H (like &quot;South Harmon Institute of Technology&quot; in the film &quot;Accepted&quot; (2006), and &quot;Ship High In Transit&quot; (or the variant &quot;Store High In Transit&quot; in the film &quot;Kenny&quot; (2006)). &quot;South Hudson Institute of Technology&quot; has sometimes been used to describe the United States Military Academy at West Point.

In polite company, sometimes backronyms such as &quot;Sugar Honey in Tea&quot; or &quot;Sugar Honey Ice(d) Tea&quot; are used.

==Usage in classical poetry==
Satirist Jonathan Swift wrote a controversial poem &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Dressing Room&quot; containing the following lines (115 through 118):

==Usage on television==
===Canada===
In Canada, &quot;shit&quot; is one of the words considered by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council to be &quot;coarse, offensive language intended for adults&quot;, acceptable for broadcast only after 9:00 p.m.

On the Canadian Showcase television show &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;, characters frequently use the term &quot;shit&quot;. For example, the fictional trailer park supervisor James &quot;Jim&quot; Lahey employs many metaphors with the negative slang &quot;shit&quot; bizarrely worked in; in one episode, Mr. Lahey likens Ricky&#x27;s growing ignorance to that of a &quot;shit tsunami&quot;, while in another episode, Mr. Lahey tells Bubbles the &quot;shit hawks are swooping in low&quot; due to his deplorable behavior and company. The term &quot;shit&quot; is also used in the titles of that show&#x27;s episodes, themselves, e.g., &quot;The Winds of Shit&quot;, &quot;A Shit Leopard Can&#x27;t Change Its Spots&quot;, and &quot;Never Cry Shitwolf&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
The first person to say &quot;shit&quot; on British TV was John Cleese of the &quot;Monty Python&quot; comedy troupe, in the late 1960s, according to his own eulogy for Graham Chapman. However, this is not independently verified. The phrase &quot;thick as pigshit&quot; is used in the 1969 BBC play &quot;The Big Flame&quot;. The word &quot;shit&quot; also appears in the British film &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot; (1966), which might pre-date John Cleese&#x27;s use.

===United States===
The word has become increasingly acceptable on American cable television and satellite radio, which are not subject to FCC regulation. In other English-speaking countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, the word is allowed to be used in broadcast television by the regulative councils of each area, as long as it is used in late hours when young people are not expected to be watching. It has appeared on ABC News&#x27; &quot;20/20&quot;.

&quot;Shit&quot; was one of the original &quot;Seven Words You Can Never Say On TV&quot;, a comedy routine by the American comedian George Carlin. In the United States, although the use of the word is censored on broadcast network television (while its synonym &quot;&quot; is not usually subject to censorship), the FCC permitted some exceptions. For example:

* The 14 October 1999 episode of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; is the first show (excluding documentaries) on U.S. network television to contain the word &quot;shit&quot; in uncensored form. 
* The word also is used in a later &quot;ER&quot; episode, &quot;On the Beach&quot; by Dr. Mark Greene, while experiencing the final stages of a deadly brain tumor. Although the episode was originally aired uncensored, the &quot;shit&quot; utterance has since been edited out in syndicated reruns.

An episode of &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;It Hits the Fan&quot; (original airdate 20 June 2001), parodied the hype over the &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; episode. In it, &quot;shit&quot; is used 162 times, and a counter in the corner of the screen tallies the repetitions (excluding the 38 instances of the word&#x27;s use in written forms, the raising the total to an even 200). &quot;South Park&quot; airs on American cable networks, which are outside the FCC&#x27;s regulatory jurisdiction and whose censorship of vulgar dialogue is at the discretion of the cable operators.

Since that episode, the word (as well as many on-screen depictions of feces, as well as defecation) has become a mainstay of &quot;South Park&quot;. Various episodes also feature a character, Mr. Hankey, who is a sentient piece of excrement. Other Comedy Central series, along with programming on other cable networks including FX, TBS, and as of March 2014, Adult Swim, also regularly employ the word shit. Episodes of &quot;Graceland&quot;, on the USA Network, do also.

==Usage in radio==
===United States===
Unlike satellite radio, American terrestrial radio stations must abide by FCC guidelines on obscenity to avoid punitive fines. These guidelines do not define exactly what constitutes obscenity, but it has been interpreted by some commissioners as including any form of words like &quot;shit&quot; and &quot;fuck&quot;, for whatever use.

Despite this, the word has been featured in popular songs that have appeared on broadcast radio in cases where the usage of the word is not audibly clear to the casual listener, or on live television. For example:
*In the song &quot;Man in the Box&quot; by Alice in Chains, the line &quot;Buried in my shit&quot; was played unedited over most rock radio stations. 
*The 1973 Pink Floyd song &quot;Money&quot; from the album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; contains the line &quot;Don&#x27;t give me that do goody good bullshit&quot;, and has frequently been broadcast unedited on US radio. 
*The 1980 hit album &quot;Hi Infidelity&quot; by REO Speedwagon contained the song &quot;Tough Guys&quot; which had the line &quot;she thinks they&#x27;re full of shit&quot;, that was played on broadcast radio.
*On 3 December 1994, Green Day performed &quot;Geek Stink Breath&quot;, on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;shit&quot; was not edited from tape delay live broadcast. The band did not appear on the show again until 9 April 2005.

Some notable instances of censorship of the word from broadcast television and radio include:
* Steve Miller&#x27;s &quot;Jet Airliner&quot;. Although radio stations have sometimes played an unedited version containing the line &quot;funky shit going down in the city.&quot; The song was also released with a &quot;radio edit&quot; version, replacing the &quot;funky shit&quot; with &quot;funky kicks&quot;. Another version of &quot;Jet Airliner&quot; exists in which the word &quot;shit&quot; is faded out. 
* Likewise, the Bob Dylan song &quot;Hurricane&quot; has a line about having no idea &quot;what kind of shit was about to go down,&quot; and has a radio edit version without the word.
* Gwen Stefani&#x27;s &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; video had the original album&#x27;s use of the word censored in its video.
* The music video title &quot;...on the Radio (Remember the Days)&quot; by Nelly Furtado replaced the original title &quot;Shit on the Radio (Remember the Days)&quot;.
* This also happened to &quot;That&#x27;s That Shit&quot; by Snoop Dogg featuring R. Kelly, which became &quot;That&#x27;s That&quot;.
* In Avril Lavigne&#x27;s song &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;, the Radio Disney edit of the song replaces &quot;all the shit that you do&quot; with &quot;all the stuff that you do&quot;.
*Likewise, in the song &quot;London Bridge&quot; by the Black Eyed Peas member Fergie, the phrase &quot;Oh Shit&quot; is repeatedly used as a background line. A radio edit of this song replaced &quot;Oh Shit&quot; with &quot;Oh Snap&quot;.
*Maroon 5&#x27;s &quot;Payphone&quot; replaces the line &quot;All these fairy tales are full of shit&quot; with &quot;All these fairy tales are full of it&quot;.
*Likewise, Icona Pop&#x27;s &quot;I Love It (I Don&#x27;t Care)&quot; uses &quot;I threw your stuff into the bag...&quot; in place of &quot;I threw your shit into the bag...&quot;.

==Usage in campaigns==
===Sanitation promotion===
Using the term &quot;shit&quot; (or other locally used crude words) – rather than feces or excreta – during campaigns and triggering events is a deliberate aspect of the community-led total sanitation approach which aims to stop open defecation, a massive public health problem in developing countries.

<text>Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost. The word &quot;engineer&quot; (Latin , the origin of the Ir. in the title of engineer in countries like Belgium, The Netherlands, and Indonesia) is derived from the Latin words (&quot;to contrive, devise&quot;) and (&quot;cleverness&quot;). The foundational qualifications of a licensed professional engineer typically include a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master&#x27;s degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) and passage of engineering board examinations.

The work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.

==Definition==
In 1961, the Conference of Engineering Societies of Western Europe and the United States of America defined &quot;professional engineer&quot; as follows:

==Roles and expertise==

===Design===
Engineers develop new technological solutions. During the engineering design process, the responsibilities of the engineer may include defining problems, conducting and narrowing research, analyzing criteria, finding and analyzing solutions, and making decisions. Much of an engineer&#x27;s time is spent on researching, locating, applying, and transferring information. Indeed, research suggests engineers spend 56% of their time engaged in various information behaviours, including 14% actively searching for information.

Engineers must weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements and needs. Their crucial and unique task is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result. Good problem solving skills are an important asset for engineers.

===Analysis===
Engineers apply techniques of engineering analysis in testing, production, or maintenance. Analytical engineers may supervise production in factories and elsewhere, determine the causes of a process failure, and test output to maintain quality. They also estimate the time and cost required to complete projects. Supervisory engineers are responsible for major components or entire projects. Engineering analysis involves the application of scientific analytic principles and processes to reveal the properties and state of the system, device or mechanism under study. Engineering analysis proceeds by separating the engineering design into the mechanisms of operation or failure, analyzing or estimating each component of the operation or failure mechanism in isolation, and recombining the components. They may analyze risk.

Many engineers use computers to produce and analyze designs, to simulate and test how a machine, structure, or system operates, to generate specifications for parts, to monitor the quality of products, and to control the efficiency of processes.
===Specialization and management===

Most engineers specialize in one or more engineering disciplines. Numerous specialties are recognized by professional societies, and each of the major branches of engineering has numerous subdivisions. Civil engineering, for example, includes structural engineering, along with transportation engineering, geotechnical engineering, and materials engineering, including ceramic, metallurgical, and polymer engineering. Mechanical engineering cuts across most disciplines since its core essence is applied physics. Engineers also may specialize in one industry, such as motor vehicles, or in one type of technology, such as turbines or semiconductor materials.

Several recent studies have investigated how engineers spend their time; that is, the work tasks they perform and how their time is distributed among these. Research suggests that there are several key themes present in engineers&#x27; work: technical work (i.e., the application of science to product development), social work (i.e., interactive communication between people), computer-based work and information behaviors. Among other more detailed findings, a 2012 work sampling study found that engineers spend 62.92% of their time engaged in technical work, 40.37% in social work, and 49.66% in computer-based work. Furthermore, there was considerable overlap between these different types of work, with engineers spending 24.96% of their time engaged in technical and social work, 37.97% in technical and non-social, 15.42% in non-technical and social, and 21.66% in non-technical and non-social.

Engineering is also an information-intensive field, with research finding that engineers spend 55.8% of their time engaged in various different information behaviors, including 14.2% actively seeking information from other people (7.8%) and information repositories such as documents and databases (6.4%).

The time engineers spend engaged in such activities is also reflected in the competencies required in engineering roles. In addition to engineers&#x27; core technical competence, research has also demonstrated the critical nature of their personal attributes, project management skills, and cognitive abilities to success in the role.

==Types of engineers==
There are many branches of engineering, each of which specializes in specific technologies and products. Typically, engineers will have deep knowledge in one area and basic knowledge in related areas. For example, mechanical engineering curricula typically include introductory courses in electrical engineering, computer science, materials science, metallurgy, mathematics, and software engineering.

An engineer may either be hired for a firm that requires engineers on a continuous basis, or may belong to an engineering firm that provides engineering consulting services to other firms.

When developing a product, engineers typically work in interdisciplinary teams. For example, when building robots an engineering team will typically have at least three types of engineers. A mechanical engineer would design the body and actuators. An electrical engineer would design the power systems, sensors, electronics, embedded software in electronics, and control circuitry. Finally, a software engineer would develop the software that makes the robot behave properly. Engineers that aspire to management engage in further study in business administration, project management and organizational or business psychology. Often engineers move up the management hierarchy from managing projects, functional departments, and divisions, and some eventually become CEOs of multi-national corporations.

==Ethics==
Engineers have obligations to the public, their clients, employers, and the profession. Many engineering societies have established codes of practice and codes of ethics to guide members and inform the public at large. Each engineering discipline and professional society maintains a code of ethics, which the members pledge to uphold. Depending on their specializations, engineers may also be governed by specific statute, whistleblowing, product liability laws, and often the principles of business ethics.

Some graduates of engineering programs in North America may be recognized by the iron ring or Engineer&#x27;s Ring, a ring made of iron or stainless steel that is worn on the little finger of the dominant hand. This tradition began in 1925 in Canada with The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer, where the ring serves as a symbol and reminder of the engineer&#x27;s obligations to the engineering profession. In 1972, the practice was adopted by several colleges in the United States including members of the Order of the Engineer.

==Education==
Most engineering programs involve a concentration of study in an engineering specialty, along with courses in both mathematics and the physical and life sciences. Many programs also include courses in general engineering and applied accounting. A design course, often accompanied by a computer or laboratory class or both, is part of the curriculum of most programs. Often, general courses not directly related to engineering, such as those in the social sciences or humanities, also are required.

Accreditation is the process by which engineering programs are evaluated by an external body to determine if applicable standards are met. The Washington Accord serves as an international accreditation agreement for academic engineering degrees, recognizing the substantial equivalency in the standards set by many major national engineering bodies. In the United States, post-secondary degree programs in engineering are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.

==Regulation==

In many countries, engineering tasks such as the design of bridges, electric power plants, industrial equipment, machine design and chemical plants, must be approved by a licensed professional engineer. Most commonly titled professional engineer is a license to practice and is indicated with the use of post-nominal letters; PE or P.Eng. These are common in North America, as is European engineer (EUR ING) in Europe.
In the United States, engineering is a regulated profession whose practice and practitioners are licensed and governed by law. Licensure is generally attainable through combination of education, pre-examination (Fundamentals of Engineering exam), examination (professional engineering exam), and engineering experience (typically in the area of 5+ years). Each state tests and licenses professional engineers. Currently, most states do not license by specific engineering discipline, but rather provide generalized licensure, and trust engineers to use professional judgment regarding their individual competencies; this is the favoured approach of the professional societies. Despite this, at least one of the examinations required by most states is actually focused on a particular discipline; candidates for licensure typically choose the category of examination which comes closest to their respective expertise. In the United States, an &quot;industrial exemption&quot; allows businesses to employ employees and call them an &quot;engineer&quot;, as long as such individuals are under the direct supervision and control of the business entity and function internally related to manufacturing (manufactured parts) related to the business entity, or work internally within an exempt organization. Such person does not have the final authority to approve, or the ultimate responsibility for, engineering designs, plans, or specifications that are to be incorporated into fixed works, systems, or facilities on the property of others or made available to the public. These individuals are prohibited from offering engineering services directly to the public or other businesses, or engage in practice of engineering unless the business entity is registered with the state&#x27;s board of engineering, and the practice is carried on or supervised directly only by engineers licensed to engage in the practice of engineering. In some instances, some positions, such as a &quot;sanitation engineer&quot;, does not have any basis in engineering sciences. Although some states require a BS degree in engineering accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) with no exceptions, about two thirds of the states accept BS degrees in engineering technology accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of ABET to become licensed as professional engineers. Each state has different requirements on years of experience to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) and Professional Engineering (PE) exams. A few states require a graduate MS in engineering to sit for the exams as further learning. After seven years of working after graduation, two years of responsibility for significant engineering work, continuous professional development, some highly qualified PEs are able to become International Professional Engineers Int(PE). These engineers must meet the highest level of professional competencies and this is a peer-reviewed process. Once the IntPE title is awarded, the engineer can gain easier admission to national registers of a number of members jurisdictions for international practice.

In Canada, engineering is a self-regulated profession. The profession in each province is governed by its own engineering association. For instance, in the Province of British Columbia an engineering graduate with four or more years of post graduate experience in an engineering-related field and passing exams in ethics and law will need to be registered by the Association for Professional Engineers and Geoscientists (APEGBC) in order to become a Professional Engineer and be granted the professional designation of P.Eng allowing one to practice engineering.

In Continental Europe, Latin America, Turkey, and elsewhere the title is limited by law to people with an engineering degree and the use of the title by others is illegal. In Italy, the title is limited to people who hold an engineering degree, have passed a professional qualification examination (&quot;Esame di Stato&quot;) and are enrolled in the register of the local branch of National Associations of Engineers (a public body). In Portugal, professional engineer titles and accredited engineering degrees are regulated and certified by the &quot;Ordem dos Engenheiros&quot;. In the Czech Republic, the title &quot;engineer&quot; (Ing.) is given to people with a (master&#x27;s) degree in chemistry, technology or economics for historical and traditional reasons. In Greece, the academic title of &quot;Diploma Engineer&quot; is awarded after completion of the five-year engineering study course and the title of &quot;Certified Engineer&quot; is awarded after completion of the four-year course of engineering studies at a Technological Educational Institute (TEI).

==Definition by country==
The definition of the term &quot;engineer&quot; varies across countries and continents.

=== Asia and Africa ===
In the Indian subcontinent, Russia, Middle East, Africa, and China, engineering is one of the most sought-after undergraduate courses, for which entrance examinations are highly competitive.

In Egypt, the educational system makes engineering the second-most respected profession in the country (after medicine); engineering colleges at Egyptian universities require extremely high marks on the General Certificate of Secondary Education ( &quot;al-Thānawiyyah al-`Āmmah&quot;) – in the order of 97 or 98 per cent – and are thus considered (along with the colleges of medicine, natural science, and pharmacy) to be among the &quot;pinnacle colleges&quot; ( &quot;kullīyāt al-qimmah&quot;).

In the Philippines and Filipino communities overseas, engineers who are either Filipino or not, especially those who also profess other jobs at the same time, are addressed and introduced as &quot;Engineer&quot;, rather than &quot;Sir/Madam&quot; in speech or &quot;Mr./Mrs./Ms.&quot; (&quot;G./Gng./Bb.&quot; in Filipino) before surnames. That word is used either in itself or before the given name or surname.

=== Europe ===
, thirty two countries in Europe (including nearly all 27 countries of the EU) now recognise the title of &quot;European Engineer&quot; which permits the use of the pre-nominal title of &quot;EUR ING&quot; (always fully capitalised). Each country sets its own precise qualification requirement for the use of the title (though they are all broadly equivalent). Holding the requisite qualification does not afford automatic entitlement. The title has to be applied for (and the appropriate fee paid). The holder is entitled to use the title in their passport. EUR INGs are allowed to describe themselves as professionally qualified engineers and practise as such in any of the 32 participating countries including those where the title of engineer is regulated by law.

==== France ====

In France, the term (engineer) is not a protected title and can be used by anyone who practices this profession.

However, the title (graduate engineer) is an official academic title that is protected by the government and is associated with the &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot;, which is a renowned academic degree in France. Anyone misusing this title in France can be fined a large sum and jailed, as it is usually reserved for graduates of French engineering &quot;grandes écoles&quot;. Engineering schools which were created during the French revolution have a special reputation among the French people, as they helped to make the transition from a mostly agricultural country of late 18th century to the industrially developed France of the 19th century. A great part of 19th-century France&#x27;s economic wealth and industrial prowess was created by engineers that have graduated from École Centrale Paris, École des Mines de Paris, École polytechnique or Télécom Paris. This was also the case after WWII when France had to be rebuilt. Before the &quot;réforme René Haby&quot; in the 1970s, it was very difficult to be admitted to such schools, and the French were commonly perceived as the nation&#x27;s élite. However, after the Haby reform and a series of further reforms (Modernization plans of French universities), several engineering schools were created which can be accessed with relatively lower competition.

Engineering positions in France are now shared between the graduating from engineering and the holders of a master&#x27;s degree in science from public universities.

==== Italy ====

In Italy, only people who hold a formal engineering qualification of at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree are permitted to describe themselves as an engineer. So much so that people holding such qualifications are entitled to use the pre-nominal title of &quot; (or &quot; if female - in both cases often abbreviated to &quot;Ing.&quot;) in lieu of &quot;Signore&quot;, &quot;Signorina&quot; or &quot;Signora&quot; (Mr, Miss and Mrs respectively) in the same manner as someone holding a doctorate would use the pre-nominal title &quot;Doctor&quot;.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the UK, the practice of engineering is not a regulated profession but control of the titles of chartered engineer (CEng) and incorporated engineer (IEng) is regulated. These titles are protected by law and are subject to strict requirements defined by the Engineering Council. The title CEng is in use in nations of the Commonwealth of Nations that follow or adapt British professional codes.

Many skilled and semi-skilled tradespeople in the UK, including, for example, engineering technicians who service domestic appliances or telephone systems, call themselves engineers, and the term in that context is commonly used by the public. Proposals such as a 2015 petition to the UK parliament to legally protect the title &quot;engineer&quot; so that only professional engineers could use it have been unsuccessful ()

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====
In Canada, engineering is a regulated profession whose practice and practitioners are licensed and governed by law. Licensed professional engineers are referred to as P.Eng. Many Canadian engineers wear an Iron Ring.

In all Canadian provinces, the title &quot;Professional Engineer&quot; is protected by law and any non-licensed individual or company using the title is committing a legal offence and is subject to fines and restraining orders. Contrary to insistence from the Professional Engineers Ontario (&quot;PEO&quot;) and Engineers Canada, use of the title &quot;Engineer&quot; itself has been found by Canadian law to be acceptable by those not holding P.Eng. titles.

The title of engineer is not exclusive to P.Eng titles. The title of Engineer is commonly held by &quot;Software Engineer&quot;, the Canadian Military as various ranks and positions, railway locomotive engineers, Stationary engineer and Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (AME), all of which do not commonly hold a P.Eng. designation.

==== United States ====
In the United States, the practice of professional engineering is highly regulated and the title &quot;professional engineer&quot; is legally protected, meaning that it is unlawful to use it to offer engineering services to the public unless permission, certification or other official endorsement is specifically granted by that state through a professional engineering license.

=== Spanish-speaking countries ===
Certain Spanish-speaking countries follow the Italian convention of engineers using the pre-nominal title, in this case &quot; (or &quot; if female). Like in Italy, it is usually abbreviated to &quot;Ing.&quot; In Spain this practice is not followed.

The engineering profession enjoys high prestige in Spain, ranking close to medical doctors, scientists and professors, and above judges, journalists or entrepreneurs, according to a 2014 study.

<doc id="38226" wikidata="Q7835200" url="?curid=38226" title="Transportation in Boston">
<text>Transportation in Boston includes roadway, subway, regional rail, air, and sea options for passenger and freight transit in Boston, Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) operates the Port of Boston, which includes a container shipping facility in South Boston, and Logan International Airport, in East Boston. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) operates bus, subway, short-distance rail, and water ferry passenger services throughout the city and region. Amtrak operates passenger rail service to and from major Northeastern cities, and a major bus terminal at South Station is served by varied intercity bus companies. The city is bisected by major highways I-90 and I-93, the intersection of which has undergone a major renovation, nicknamed the Big Dig.

== Road transportation ==

=== Road infrastructure ===

Except for the Back Bay and part of the South Boston neighborhoods, Boston has no street grid. The City of Boston, composed of many smaller towns annexed over the years, retained most of the pre-existing street names, resulting in many duplicates throughout the city.

Expressways and freeways in and around Greater Boston are laid out with two circumferential expressways: Interstate 495 and Route 128. The circumferential routes are intersected by several radial highways, including:

* Interstate 93 (the Northern/Southeast Expressway), which extends north of the city into New Hampshire, and southward to the Braintree Split,
* Interstate 90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike), connecting Boston with Worcester and Springfield,
* United States Route 1 (the Northeast Expressway/Newburyport Turnpike), crossing the Tobin Bridge and eventually serving Newburyport,
* Storrow Drive, an unnumbered high-speed parkway along the Charles River connecting downtown Boston with the Route 2 corridor,
* U.S. Route 20, a route running from Kenmore Square to Newport, Oregon — although it is not an expressway.
* Massachusetts Route 2 (the Concord Turnpike/Alewife Brook Parkway), serving the northwestern suburbs including Lexington, Concord and Fitchburg,
* Massachusetts Route 3 (the Pilgrims Highway), connecting Boston with Cape Cod,
* United States Route 3 (the Northwest Expressway), a functionally separate highway serving Lowell, Burlington and other suburbs in between Route 2 and I-93,
* Massachusetts Route 24, serving the interior southern suburbs, including Brockton, Taunton and Fall River 
* and Interstate 95, indirectly connecting Boston with Rhode Island via I-93.

By the early 1990s, traffic on the elevated downtown portions of I-93 and Route 1 (the Central Artery) was 190,000 vehicles per day, with an accident rate four times the national average for urban interstates. Traffic was bumper-to-bumper for six to eight hours per day, with projections of traffic jams doubling by 2010. Also, the elevated structure itself was decaying, after more than a half century of continuous use. For most of the 1990s and early 2000s, driving in Boston was disrupted by the Big Dig, the most expensive (roughly $14 billion) road project in the history of the US.

After more than 15 years of disruption, The Big Dig, along with other highway projects, provided less than 10 years of relief before congestion returned to the levels seen in &quot;prerecession 2005, when the Big Dig was almost complete and marketed as the solution to gridlock for commuters ... analyses would conclude that the added capacity attracted more drivers, and pushed the traffic bottlenecks farther into the suburbs.&quot; However even without the big dig the raised road was structurally deficient and needed rebuilding or replacement.

Boston remains one of the most congested metropolitan areas in the US. The complex and still-changing road network, with many one-way streets and time-based traffic restrictions, has led many Boston travelers to consider an up-to-date GPS navigation map system a necessity.

=== Walking and bicycling ===
Boston is known to travel agents as &quot;America&#x27;s Walking City&quot;, has been rated as the third most walkable city in the US by Walk Score, and also has a high Transit Score.

Boston is a compact city, sized right for walking or bicycling. According to a &quot;Prevention&quot; magazine report in 2003, the city has the highest percentage of on-foot commuters of any city in the United States. In 2000, 13.36% of Boston commuters walked to work according to the US Census. This was the highest of any major US city, bested only by college towns such as nearby Cambridge. Most of the area&#x27;s cities and towns have standing committees devoted to improvements to the bicycle and pedestrian environment. The first pedestrian advocacy organization in the United States, WalkBoston, was started in Boston in 1990, and helped start the national pedestrian advocacy organization America Walks.

Cycling is popular in Boston, for both recreation and commuting. Some bicycle paths are marked on some roadways, but very few completely separated paths are available to cyclists. The Minuteman Bikeway (which runs through several suburbs northwest of Boston) and the Charles River bike paths are popular with recreational cyclists and tourists. The Emerald Necklace system of parklands and parkways, pioneered by Frederick Law Olmsted and his sons, provides some more pleasant alternative routes for cyclists. The Southwest Corridor also provides cycling infrastructure, as does the East Boston Greenway. Many MBTA riders use a bicycle to get to a nearby station, and the number of bicycle racks and lockers has been increased.

However &quot;Bicycling&quot; magazine, in its March 2006 issue, named the city as one of its three worst cities in the United States for cycling. The distinction was earned for &quot;lousy roads, scarce and unconnected bike lanes and bike-friendly gestures from City Hall that go nowhere—such as hiring a bike coordinator in 2001, only to cut the position two years later&quot;. Neighboring Cambridge earned an honorable mention as one of the best cities for cycling with a population of 75,000-200,000.

Since September 2007, when Mayor Thomas Menino started a bicycle program called Boston Bikes with a goal of improving bicycling conditions by adding bike lanes and racks and offering bikeshare programs, the city has improved accommodations for bicyclists in a number of ways. The least visible improvement is zoning and building code changes to encourage showering and locker facilities in major office buildings. Better signage and lane markings for bicyclists are starting to appear. More visible enforcement of traffic regulations on motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians has commenced.

Boston has an active Critical Mass ride group, and MassBike is a bike advocacy group active in supporting cyclists in the area. The LivableStreets Alliance, headquartered in Cambridge, is an advocacy group for bicyclists, pedestrians, and walkable neighborhoods.

====Maps and guides====
The Boston regional Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) publishes a large and detailed &quot;Greater Boston Cycling &amp; Walking Map&quot;, which it distributes free of charge. The map is also available online and in downloadable form, and revisions are solicited from the general public.

In addition, a small private company called Rubel BikeMaps has for many years published and distributed an extensive lineup of books and maps covering Boston, the state of Massachusetts, and nearby areas of New England. These publications are for sale at many bicycle shops, and online. Because of recent expansion of bike lanes and other facilities, plus increased input from the public, it is important to use the most recent editions of these maps and guides.

Rubel BikeMaps also publishes &quot;Car-Free in Boston:a Guide for Locals and Visitors&quot;, still in its 10th edition . Prepared by the Association for Public Transportation (APT), this book contains extensive information useful to bicyclists and pedestrians alike, including coverage of intermodal travel and handicapped accessibility. Although the general overview and travel tips are largely still relevant, this classic book has not been updated since 2003, and must be supplemented by current online information.

With widespread use of smartphones and tablet computers, online mapping services such as Google Maps have become popular aids for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists. The MBTA was one of the earliest large transit agencies to embrace the Open Data philosophy, making route, scheduling, and real-time vehicle location information publicly available in the standard GTFS format. As a result, many third-party apps are available on a number of hardware platforms, allowing riders a wide range of choices in obtaining travel information. Google Maps has started to present maps of the interiors of underground subway stations, and this information is available on Android and iOS smartphones, as well as web browsers.

=== Buses ===

162 MBTA bus routes operate within the Greater Boston area, with a combined ridership of approximately 375,000 one-way trips per day, making it the seventh-busiest local bus agency in the country. The bus fare is $1.70 with a CharlieCard, or $2 with a CharlieTicket or cash; monthly commuter passes are available, as are reduced fare transfers between most bus lines and the subway.

In an effort to provide service intermediate in speed and capacity between subways and buses, the MBTA has begun projects using bus rapid transit (BRT) technology. The MBTA has one BRT line, the Silver Line, although this operates in two discontinuous sections. The Silver Line operates in part via dedicated trolleybus tunnel, in part via on-street reserved bus lanes, and in part mixed with general street traffic. Service through the trolleybus tunnel is by dual-mode buses, which operate electrically in the tunnel and within a short section on the surface, and which use diesel power for the rest of the route.

Massport operates the Logan Express, an express bus service between Logan International Airport and suburban park-and-ride lots.

Several privately owned commuter bus services take passengers between the city and suburbs. Transportation Management Associations also run public shuttles to specific employment centers, such as the EZ Ride for Kendall Square; and the Route 128 Business Council shuttles around Alewife, Needham, and Waltham; Partners HealthCare runs public shuttles among its locations. The MASCO TMA operates six commuter shuttles for the use of Longwood Medical Area employees and students run by the MASCO TMA for the Longwood Medical Area. The MASCO M2 shuttle between Harvard Square and the LMA via Massachusetts Avenue is available for public use, though tickets or cash card must be purchased in advance. Many colleges and universities also run private shuttles for students and employees.

In June 2014, the Cambridge-based startup Bridj began running &quot;data driven&quot; bus service in core neighborhoods. It uses a mixture of fixed and dynamic routes and pricing, depending on where and when registered members say they want to go.

===Parking===
Since automobiles did not exist in 1630, when Boston was first settled, parking was not a consideration. The city that sprung up around and away from the original North End neighborhood accommodates cars only awkwardly; parking comes at a premium throughout the city. Off-street parking spaces have sold for more than $160,000 on Beacon Hill. On-street parking is the norm in many sections, and the city created a resident permit parking program to reserve street space for permanent residents in certain neighborhoods. The parking permits are free to Boston residents, however, and the program is overused; permitted spaces remain scarce. Meters citywide are priced at $1.25 per hour, and metered spaces are also often difficult to find.

The number of public parking spaces downtown has been capped since the mid-1970s. The number of parking spaces in East and South Boston, and the hours that they may be used, also is restricted by state regulation. This is part of the state Department of Environmental Protection&#x27;s plan, approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to address the non-compliance of the region with the mandatory National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone.

The MBTA operates several large park and ride facilities on its subway and commuter rail lines, close to major highways, providing access to downtown. While most of these tend to fill up with commuters on weekday mornings, they provide a good place for visitors to leave their cars and see the city without parking hassles on evenings and weekends.

== Rail transportation ==
Boston has two discrete rail networks. One of these, the MBTA, widely nicknamed &quot;the T&quot;, includes elements of light rail/streetcar operation as well as traditional subway technology. (The Red, Orange, Blue, and Green Lines have no physical rail interconnections with each other, though they are all operated by the MBTA and exchange passengers in shared stations.) The second network forms the Boston area portion of the North American rail network, and provides commuter rail, intercity passenger rail and freight rail services.

Although the two networks are essentially unconnected, they do in some places run alongside each other in the same right of way. Interchange stations allow interchange of passengers, but not trains, between subway and commuter rail services. Parts of the subway network also use former common user rail rights of way.

=== Subway network ===

Boston has the oldest subway system in North America, with the first underground streetcar traffic dating back to 1897. Today the whole subway network is owned and operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).

In the early 1960s, the then-newly-formed MBTA hired Cambridge Seven Associates to help develop a new brand identity. Cambridge Seven came up with a circled T to represent such concepts as &quot;transit&quot;, &quot;transportation&quot; and &quot;tunnel.&quot; Today, Bostonians call their rapid transit network &quot;the T&quot;, and it is the fourth busiest in the country, with daily ridership of 273,000 trips on its heavy rail and 90,700 on its light rail. This compares with the Washington Metro&#x27;s heavy rail daily ridership of 326,300, the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27;&#x27;s 334,200, and Los Angeles&#x27;s 76,800, but is overshadowed by New York City&#x27;s 6.335 million average daily weekday trips.

The one-way fare is $2.40. Monthly commuter passes, and day and week visitor&#x27;s passes are also available for purchase. There are four subway lines in the metropolitan Boston area: the Red Line, Green Line, Orange Line, and Blue Line. The colors of each line have a symbolic meaning: the Blue Line runs under Boston Harbor; the Red Line used to terminate at Harvard University (whose school color is crimson); the Orange Line used to run along Washington Street, which was once called Orange Street; and the Green Line runs along parts of the Emerald Necklace into the leafy suburbs of Brookline and Newton.

The Green Line is actually four different lines; it starts as one trunk line but then splits into four different branches, the B (Boston College), C (Cleveland Circle), D (Riverside) and E (Heath Street) trains. Because the split is only relevant on the outbound direction of travel, one may take any train inbound, but when going outbound one must be careful to board the correct train. The Red Line splits as well, with southbound trains going either to Braintree or Ashmont.

Though most of Boston&#x27;s rapid transit network is powered via third rail, the outermost portions of the Blue Line, as well as all of the Green Line and Mattapan Line, are powered via overhead lines. The name &quot;subway&quot; is something of a misnomer; as with other systems, large segments run above ground when far from the city&#x27;s downtown. Additionally, the Green and Mattapan Lines are technically light-rail services, using LRVs and streetcars rather than typical multiple unit heavy railcar equipment. The Ashmont–Mattapan line uses refurbished classic pre-war &quot;PCC&quot; trolleys on an exclusive right of way; the Green Line relies on modern high-capacity LRV cars from Japan and Italy.

Like the New York City Subway, Boston&#x27;s subway system in theory does keep to an exact fixed schedule. Starting around 2011, the MBTA introduced overhead displays at the train platform level which indicate estimated arrival times for the next two trains in each direction. In addition, real-time information about train location (and bus location) is available via an Open Data protocol on the Internet, enabling a large number of third-party smartphone apps and web sites to display expected arrival times throughout the MBTA system. The Green Line relies more on operators than its signal system compared to other lines, especially where trams are driven across or even in automobile lanes on surface rails. Due to a sparsity of data collected by the existing system, real-time Green Line arrival predictions are not expected until tracking infrastructure upgrades are completed in 2015.

====Elevated sections====
Despite the first rapid transit segment being built underground, many later parts were built as elevated railways. A century later, most of these elevated railway sections have been replaced by cut or tunnel routing. The only remaining classic elevated structures are the Green Line&#x27;s Lechmere Viaduct, including the Science Park and Lechmere stations, and a short segment of the Red Line at Charles-MGH, connecting the tunnel under Beacon Hill to the Longfellow Bridge.

The Boston Elevated Railway was the company that owned all the elevateds and subways. The following Els once existed:
*Causeway Street Elevated (closed 2004), from the Haymarket Incline to the Lechmere Viaduct
*Washington Street Elevated (closed 1987), from Forest Hills to an incline north of the Masspike
*Charlestown Elevated (closed April 4, 1975), from the Haymarket Incline to Everett
*Atlantic Avenue Elevated (closed 1938), from the Washington Street El at the Castle Street Wye at Herald Street (Tower &#x27;D&#x27;) to the Charlestown El and Causeway Street El at North Station (Tower &#x27;C&#x27;)

=== Common user rail network ===
Unlike the subway, which is owned and operated by the MBTA, the common user network is owned and operated by a mixture of various public and private sector bodies. In the Boston area, trackage is owned by a mixture of the MBTA and several freight railroads. Commuter rail services are operated by the Keolis Commuter Services (KCS) under contract to the MBTA, intercity passenger services are operated by Amtrak, and freight services are operated by the various freight railroads. Trackage rights allow trains of one operator to make use of tracks owned by another.

==== Commuter rail ====

The MBTA commuter rail system brings people from as far away as Worcester and Providence (Rhode Island) into Boston. There are approximately 125,000 one-way trips on the commuter rail each day, making it the fifth-busiest commuter rail system in the country, outranked only by the various systems serving New York and Chicago suburbs.

There are two major rail terminals in Boston: North Station and South Station. Commuter rail lines from the North Shore and northwestern suburbs begin and terminate at North Station; lines from the South Shore and the west start and end at South Station. There is no direct rail connection between North Station and South Station, so that interchange between the two stations generally requires the use of two different subway lines (Red/Orange or Red/Green). However, passengers on commuter lines serving Back Bay Station can interchange directly from there to North Station using the Orange Line, and passengers on the Fitchburg Line can interchange directly from Porter to South Station using the Red Line.

==== Intercity rail ====

Boston is served by four intercity rail services, all operated by Amtrak. The &quot;Acela&quot; and &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; services both operate on the Northeast Corridor to and from Washington, D.C., with stops in places such as New York City and Philadelphia. A branch of the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; service operates to and from Chicago. The &quot;Downeaster&quot; service operates to and from Brunswick, Maine.

The Northeast Corridor services terminate at South Station, as does the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;. The &quot;Downeaster&quot; service terminates at North Station, primarily because the &quot;Downeaster&quot; Amtrak line is intended for points north of downtown. The Northeast Corridor and &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; services also stop at Back Bay station. The lack of a direct rail connection between North Station and South Station means that passengers transferring to and from the &quot;Downeaster&quot; are faced with a transfer between stations. Although most such transfers can be achieved using the Orange Line between Back Bay and North Station, Amtrak recommends passengers with luggage to use a taxi.

Within the Boston area, most Amtrak services operate over commuter rail track owned by the MBTA, who also own the Northeast Corridor track as far as the Rhode Island state line.

=== Major transit hubs ===
There are several major transit terminals in the Boston metropolitan area.

Major rail stations include:
* South Station, which is served by Amtrak and MBTA commuter trains and subways, and intercity buses via the adjacent bus terminal 
* North Station, which is served by Amtrak and MBTA commuter trains and subways

==== Freight rail ====
CSX is the only class I railroad serving the Boston area, which it reaches by its Boston Subdivision line to Springfield, and by trackage rights over the Northeast Corridor. CSX also has trackage rights over much of the southern half of the MBTA&#x27;s commuter rail network. In February 2013, CSX moved freight operations from its Beacon Park Yard in Allston to a newly refurbished double stack intermodal yard in Worcester and a new transload facility in Westborough.

The other significant freight railroad in the Boston area is Pan Am Railways (PAR; formerly known as the Guilford Rail System). PAR is a class II railroad that operates lines to the north and west of Boston, reaching destinations in New Hampshire, Maine and New York as well as Massachusetts. It also has trackage rights over much of the northern half of the MBTA&#x27;s commuter rail network. In May 2008, PAR announced a venture with Norfolk Southern Railway to create a jointly owned freight corridor, branded the Patriot Corridor, linking Boston to a newly refurbished intermodal yard in Mechanicville, New York, just north of Albany.

Only a few rail freight customers remain in or near Boston, including a chemical packager in Allston, and food distribution facilities and a scrap metal processor in Everett. The Class III Fore River Railroad serves two major customers in Quincy. A plan to ship ethanol by rail to a gasoline mixing plant in Revere was reviewed in 2013. In the face of community opposition and pressure from the state legislature, the company withdrew its proposal on July 2, days before the Lac-Mégantic derailment.

== Water transportation ==

=== Port of Boston ===
The Port of Boston is a major seaport and the largest port in Massachusetts. It was historically important for the growth of the city, and was originally located in what is now the downtown area of the city. Land reclamation and conversion to other uses means that downtown area no longer handles commercial traffic, although the US Coast Guard maintains a major base there, and there is still considerable ferry and leisure usage.

Today the principal cargo handling facilities are located in the Boston neighborhoods of Charlestown, East Boston, and South Boston, and in the neighbouring city of Everett. In 2011, the port handled over 11.5 million metric tons of cargo, including 192,000 container TEUs. Other major forms of cargo processed at the port include petroleum, liquefied natural gas (LNG), automobiles, cement, gypsum, and salt.

The &quot;Black Falcon Cruise Terminal&quot; situated in South Boston, was renovated and expanded in 2010. 
 During 2012, it served 117 ships and more than 380,000 passengers.

=== Passenger boat services ===

The MBTA Boat system comprises several ferry routes on Boston Harbor. One of these is an inner harbor service, linking the downtown waterfront with Boston Navy Yard in Charlestown. The other routes are commuter routes, linking downtown to Hingham, Hull and Quincy. Some commuter services connect via Logan International Airport. All services are operated by private sector companies under contract to the MBTA.

Outside the MBTA system, seasonal passenger ferry services operate to the Boston Harbor Islands, to the city of Salem north of Boston, and to the town of Provincetown on Cape Cod. Water taxis provide on-demand service from various points on the downtown waterfront and from Logan Airport, and in particular between the airport and downtown.

Several companies operate tourist oriented cruise boats on the harbor and on the Charles River. Other companies operate duck tours that use amphibious vehicles (mostly derived from World War II era DUKWs), and encompass both the city&#x27;s streets and its waterways. On a much smaller scale, but perhaps more iconic of Boston, are the human-powered Swan Boats on the lake of the city&#x27;s Public Garden.

==Commuting statistics==
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Boston, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 83 min. 29% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 15 minutes, while 24% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km, while 12% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

In 2013, the Boston-Cambridge-Newton metropolitan statistical area (Boston MSA) had the seventh-lowest percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (75.6 percent), with 6.2 percent of area workers traveling via rail transit. During the period starting in 2006 and ending in 2013, the Boston MSA had the greatest percentage decline of workers commuting by automobile (3.3 percent) among MSAs with more than a half-million residents.

In 2019, a yearly ranking of time wasted in traffic listed Boston area drivers lost approximately 164 hours a year in lost productivity due to the area&#x27;s traffic congestion. This amounted to $2,300 a year per driver in costs.

==Aviation==
Boston&#x27;s principal airport is Logan International Airport (BOS), situated in East Boston just across inner Boston Harbor from downtown Boston. Logan Airport is operated by the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) and has extensive domestic and international airline service. The airport is linked to downtown by several highway tunnels. The Silver Line bus rapid transit uses these tunnels to connect Logan&#x27;s terminals with South Station. There are also shuttle buses between the terminals and the Blue Line Airport station.

To help address overcrowding at Logan Airport, Massport operates two other airports in eastern Massachusetts:
* L.G. Hanscom Field
* Worcester Regional Airport: formerly owned by the city of Worcester until ownership transfer to Massport was mandated by law in 2009, and subsequently completed on June 22, 2010.

In addition, MassPort has designated two out of state regional airports (which are administered independently) as reliever airports:
* T. F. Green Airport near Providence, Rhode Island
* Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in Manchester, New Hampshire

There are also several general aviation facilities for private planes in the Boston area, including Beverly Regional Airport and Lawrence Municipal Airport to the north, Hanscom Field to the west, and Norwood Memorial Airport to the south. 

Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, strict security has been implemented at all of Boston&#x27;s airports. Because of this and its location as the closest American port to Europe, Boston is an emergency destination for airliners that experience security or mechanical problems while en route to the US, although they may also be diverted to Halifax, Nova Scotia, or other Canadian airports.

==Boston Vision Zero Plan==

In 2015, mayor Marty Walsh announced that the city of Boston would become part of a worldwide program known as Vision Zero. Vision Zero is a plan self described as “a new standard for safety on our streets.” The plan aims to eliminate deaths caused by transportation, whether that be pedestrians, personal vehicle riders, or cyclists.

Since 2015, the city of Boston has adopted several different policies aimed to help bring down the number of fatalities caused by Transportation in Boston. These policies include the creation of a 25-mile per hour speed limit law citywide, and the implementation of Neighborhood Slow Streets, a tool of Traffic calming designed to make personal vehicles slow down in residential areas. Pedestrian deaths have fallen to 57 in 2019, down from the 2017 total of 82. Cyclist deaths have also fallen from 10 in 2017 to just 3 in 2019.

Boston now seeks to expand this plan by committing more funds to the program, as they currently spend roughly five dollars per person annually on the Vision Zero plan, whereas cities like San Francisco spend upwards of seventy five dollars per person annually. Boston aims to eliminate vehicle crash fatalities by 2030, while planning for more Neighborhood Slow Streets, speed humps, and curb extensions to help bring vehicle fatalities down to zero. One area that the Boston Transportation Department specifically wants to focus on are the numerous Boston public schools, stating in their 2017/2018 vision zero report, that “We will be upgrading school zone flashers throughout the City and focusing on schools as we select locations for future safety improvements.”

<text>Lanford Wilson (April 13, 1937March 24, 2011) was an American playwright. His work, as described by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was &quot;earthy, realist, greatly admired [and] widely performed&quot;. Wilson helped to advance the off-off-Broadway theater movement with his earliest plays, which were first produced at the Caffe Cino beginning in 1964. He was one of the first playwrights to move from off-off-Broadway to off-Broadway, then Broadway and beyond.

Wilson was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Drama &amp; Performance Art in 1972. He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1980 and was elected in 2001 to the American Theater Hall of Fame. In 2004, Wilson was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and received the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award as a Master American Dramatist. He was nominated for three Tony Awards and has won a Drama Desk Award and five Obie Awards.

Wilson&#x27;s 1964 short play &quot;The Madness of Lady Bright&quot; was his first major success and led to further works throughout the 1960s that expressed a variety of social and romantic themes. In 1969, he co-founded the Circle Repertory Company with theatre director Marshall W. Mason. He wrote many plays for the Circle Repertory in the 1970s. His 1973 play &quot;The Hot l Baltimore&quot; was the company&#x27;s first major success with both audiences and critics. The off-Broadway production exceeded 1,000 performances.

His play &quot;Fifth of July&quot; was first produced at Circle Repertory in 1978. He received a Tony Award nomination for its Broadway production, which opened in 1980. A prequel to &quot;Fifth of July&quot; called &quot;Talley&#x27;s Folly&quot; (opened 1979 at Circle Repertory) opened on Broadway before &quot;Fifth of July&quot; and won Wilson the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and his first Tony nomination. &quot;Burn This&quot; (1987) was another Broadway success. Wilson also wrote the libretti for several operas.

==Childhood and education==
Wilson was born to Ralph Eugene and Violetta Tate Wilson in Lebanon, Missouri. After his parents divorced when he was 5, he moved with his mother to Springfield, Missouri, where they lived until she remarried. When he was 11, his mother married Walt E. Lenhard, a farmer from Ozark, Missouri, and they both moved in with him. He had two half-brothers, John and Jim, and one stepsister, Judy. He attended high school in Ozark and developed a love for film and art. As a child, Wilson enjoyed writing short stories and going to see plays performed at Southwest Missouri State College (now Missouri State University). A production of &quot;Brigadoon&quot; had a particularly resounding effect on Wilson, saying that &quot;after that town came back to life on stage, movies didn&#x27;t stand a chance&quot;. He developed an interest in acting and performed in his high school plays, including the role of Tom in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; by Tennessee Williams.

After graduating from Ozark High School in 1955, Wilson began his collegiate studies at Southwest Missouri State College. In 1956, he moved to San Diego, where his father had relocated after his parents&#x27; divorce. He studied art and art history at San Diego State College as well as worked as a riveter at the Ryan Aircraft Plant. His reunion with his father was difficult, but the relationship improved in later years, and Wilson based his play &quot;Lemon Sky&quot; on their relationship. Wilson left college and moved to Chicago in 1957, where he worked as a graphic artist for an advertising firm. During this time, Wilson realized that the short stories he had always enjoyed writing would be more effective as plays, and began to study playwriting at the University of Chicago extension program.

==Early work (1962–1968)==
In 1962, Wilson moved to Greenwich Village in New York City. He worked in odd jobs, such as a temporary typist, a reservations clerk at Americana Hotel, at the complaint desk of a furniture store, and at a dishwashing job where a co-worker incorrectly called him &quot;Lance&quot;. After that, Wilson&#x27;s friends all called him by that name. Wilson eventually worked for the subscription office of the New York Shakespeare Festival.

Wilson first encountered the Caffe Cino when he went to see Eugène Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;The Lesson&quot;. The experience left him thinking that theatre &quot;could be both dangerous and funny in that way at the same time&quot;. After the show, Wilson introduced himself to Cino co-founder and producer Joe Cino, a pioneer of the off-off-Broadway movement. Cino encouraged Wilson to submit a play to the Cino. In Cino, Wilson found a mentor who would not only critique his plays, but also stage them.

Wilson&#x27;s first play to premiere at Cino was &quot;So Long at the Fair&quot;, in August 1963. His works for Caffe Cino include &quot;Ludlow Fair&quot; (originally titled &quot;Nail Polish and Tampons&quot;), &quot;Home Free!&quot;, and &quot;The Madness of Lady Bright&quot;. He continued working odd jobs to support himself during these early years. &quot;The Madness of Lady Bright&quot; premiered at Caffe Cino in May 1964. The play concerns &quot;Lady&quot; Bright, who is a forty-year-old &quot;screaming preening queen&quot;. On a sultry summer day in the 1960s, while in his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, &quot;Lady&quot; Bright slowly loses his mind. It is a complex and comic tragedy of striking originality, and one of Wilson&#x27;s most notable and finest works. At its heart, the work is a penetrating study of loneliness and isolation. It was one of off-off-Broadway&#x27;s first significant successes, running for over 200 performances. &quot;The Madness of Lady Bright&quot; set a record as the longest-running play at Caffe Cino.

In 1965, Wilson began writing plays for Ellen Stewart&#x27;s La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village. His first full-length plays premiered at La MaMa, including &quot;Balm in Gilead&quot;, which depicted a doomed romance in an urban greasy spoon diner inhabited by junkies, prostitutes and thieves. &quot;Balm in Gilead&quot; premiered at La MaMa in 1965, directed by Marshall W. Mason. The play was revived in 1984 by Circle Repertory Company and the Steppenwolf Theatre Company, and directed by John Malkovich. Later in 1965, Wilson wrote and directed &quot;Miss Williams&quot; for a benefit performance at La MaMa called &quot;BbAaNnGg!&quot;.

In 1965, Wilson&#x27;s plays &quot;Home Free!&quot; and &quot;No Trespassing&quot; were produced for La MaMa Repertory Troupe&#x27;s first European tour. His play &quot;This is the Rill Speaking&quot; was produced alongside Jean-Claude van Itallie&#x27;s &quot;War&quot; and Rochelle Owens&#x27; &quot;Homo&quot; for La MaMa Repertory Troupe&#x27;s second European tour, in 1966. His play &quot;Untitled&quot; was produced with work by Sam Shepard, Tom Eyen, Leonard Melfi, Paul Foster, and Owens, all directed by Tom O&#x27;Horgan, for La MaMa Repertory Troupe&#x27;s third European tour, in 1967. In addition to writing his own plays at La MaMa, Wilson did set design for work by other playwrights. In 1966, he designed the set for Foster&#x27;s &quot;The Madonna in the Orchard&quot;, directed by O&#x27;Horgan at La MaMa. He then designed the set for Donald Julian&#x27;s &quot;In Praise of Folly&quot;, directed by Mason at La MaMa in 1969.

Wilson&#x27;s play &quot;The Sand Castle&quot; was first produced at La MaMa in 1965, as directed by Mason, and was again directed by Mason at La MaMa in 1967. Wilson participated in the inaugural National Playwrights Conference in 1965 at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center along with Sam Shepard, Edward Albee, and John Guare. His 1966 play &quot;The Rimers of Eldritch&quot; addressed hypocrisy and narrow-mindedness in a small town in the rural Midwest and won the 1966/1967 Drama Desk Vernon Rice Award for contribution to off-Broadway theatre. It was first produced at La MaMa in 1966, under Wilson&#x27;s direction. Wilson directed a revival of &quot;The Rimers of Eldritch&quot; at La MaMa in 1981 in celebration of the theater&#x27;s 20-year anniversary.

&quot;The Rimers of Eldritch&quot; was followed by &quot;The Gingham Dog&quot; (1968) about the breakup of an interracial couple. He returned to the O&#x27;Neill Theater Center to develop &quot;Lemon Sky&quot; in 1968. Wilson described &quot;Lemon Sky&quot; (1968) as &quot;directly autobiographical&quot;. The play&#x27;s narrator Alan, Wilson&#x27;s representation of himself, describes his attempt to reconcile with his long-absent father. They fail to meet each other&#x27;s expectations, and Alan leaves disillusioned by his father&#x27;s authoritarianism and narrow-mindedness.

==Circle Repertory Company and later work (1969–2011) ==

In 1969, Wilson co-founded the Circle Repertory Company with Marshall W. Mason, Tanya Berezin, and Rob Thirkield. Many of Wilson&#x27;s plays were first produced at the Circle Repertory and directed by Mason. Also in 1969, Wilson was hired for $5,000 to adapt Tennessee Williams&#x27; short story &quot;One Arm&quot;, about a male hustler, into a screenplay. The day after he finished the screenplay, he was invited to a preview of &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, and after seeing the film thought &quot;there went that idea down the drain&quot;.

His first plays at Circle Repertory, &quot;The Great Nebula in Orion&quot;, &quot;Ikke, Ikke, Nye, Nye, Nye&quot;, and &quot;The Family Continues&quot;, premiered in 1972. &quot;The Hot l Baltimore&quot;, about lowlifes who face eviction when the decaying hotel in which they live is to be demolished, opened in 1973 and was Circle Repertory&#x27;s first commercial success. The play also won the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award and an Obie Award. It then transferred off-Broadway to the Circle in the Square Theatre and ran for 1,166 performances. &quot;The Hot l Baltimore&quot; was adapted into a short-lived television series by ABC in 1975, which Wilson pronounced &quot;a disaster&quot;.

In 1974, Wilson acted in Circle Repertory&#x27;s production of E. E. Cummings&#x27; &quot;Him&quot; under the direction of Marshal Oglesby. In 1975, Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Mound Builders&quot;, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as Wilson&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious work&quot;, premiered at Circle Rep. The play concerned an ill-fated archeological dig in the Midwest, and, thematically, contemplated the futility of man&#x27;s achievements. Circle Repertory then produced Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Serenading Louie&quot; in 1976. The play had been unsuccessfully performed in 1970 by the Washington Theater Club, and Wilson revised it for Circle Repertory&#x27;s production, which is generally regarded as its official premiere.

Sexual identity is among the themes that Wilson explored in his plays. The theme appears in &quot;The Madness of Lady Bright&quot;, &quot;Lemon Sky&quot;, &quot;Fifth of July&quot;, and &quot;Burn This&quot;. In &quot;Fifth of July&quot;, a Broadway hit in 1980–1982, members of the Talley family decide whether to sell the family farmhouse in Missouri. The story centers on Ken Talley, a disabled Vietnam veteran, and his lover Jed, who are living in the house. Wilson was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play for &quot;Fifth of July&quot;. After &quot;Fifth of July&quot;, Wilson wrote &quot;Talley&#x27;s Folly&quot; (1979), a two-person play depicting the Midwesterner Sally Talley and Jewish Matt Friedman falling in love and become engaged despite the objections of Sally&#x27;s narrow-minded family. &quot;Talley &amp; Son&quot; premiered as &quot;A Tale Told&quot; in 1981 but was rewritten and renamed when it opened in 1985. Both are prequels set 30 years prior to &quot;Fifth of July&quot;. &quot;Talley&#x27;s Folly&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1980 and received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Play. Around this time, Norman Mailer asked Wilson to adapt &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot; for a television movie, but Wilson declined.

&quot;Angels Fall&quot; opened on Broadway in 1983, earning Wilson his third nomination for the Tony Award for Best Play. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review said, &quot;Mr. Wilson is one of the few artists in our theater who can truly make America sing.&quot; In &quot;Burn This&quot;, a young gay dancer named Robbie and his lover Dom have died in a boating accident before the play begins. Robbie&#x27;s roommates, his dance partner Anna and the gay, confident Larry, must come to terms with Robbie&#x27;s death. Anna learns to be independent and self-confident, pursuing her interest in choreography, beginning a relationship with Robbie&#x27;s grieving brother Pale, and ending her dispassionate relationship with her longtime boyfriend.

In addition to writing plays, Wilson wrote the libretti for several operas. He collaborated with composer Lee Hoiby for &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; (1971) and adapted his own play, &quot;This is the Rill Speaking&quot;, in 1992. &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; is an adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27; play of the same name. Williams gave Hoiby permission to compose an opera based on the play, and Hoiby asked Wilson to adapt the play into a libretto. &quot;This is the Rill Speaking&quot; is a one-act chamber opera that Wilson adapted from his own play of the same name. In 1984, Wilson wrote a new translation of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; for the Hartford Stage Company. Wilson attempted to make his translation sound like everyday speech, as he believed that existing translations were linguistically accurate but not inherently theatrical. Reviews of the Hartford production and a subsequent production by the Steppenwolf Theater Company praised Wilson&#x27;s idiomatic dialogue.

He also became active with the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, where some of his new short plays were produced, including the 1996 world premiere of his comedy &quot;Virgil Is Still the Frogboy&quot;, commissioned by the Bay Street Theatre and underwritten by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine. The title refers to a famous graffiti spray-painted on a railroad bridge that had puzzled people in the Hamptons for years. Directed by Marshall W. Mason, the production starred Arija Bareiikis, Bobby Cannavale, Jennifer Dundas, Thomas McCarthy, and Josh Pais, running from August 14 to September 9, 1996.

==Personal life and death==
Wilson was openly gay. After moving to New York City in 1962, he settled in an apartment on Sheridan Square in Greenwich Village, where he lived for many years. In the 1970s, he bought a house in Sag Harbor, Long Island. He lived in both places, using his Manhattan apartment primarily when he had a play in production there. When living in Manhattan, he worked with Playwrights Laboratory at the Circle Repertory Company, often attending readings, rehearsals, and productions.

Around 1998, Wilson gave up his apartment in New York to live full-time in Sag Harbor.

Wilson died on March 24, 2011, aged 73, from complications of pneumonia.

==Awards, recognition, and legacy==
In 1995, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2004, Wilson received the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award for a Master American Dramatist. Also in 2004, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

In 2009, he shared insights about his friendship with Tennessee Williams at a theatre festival in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

In 2010, Debra Monk presented Wilson with the Artistic Achievement Award from the New York Innovative Theatre Awards. This honor was awarded by the off-off-Broadway community &quot;in recognition of his brave and unique works that helped establish the off-off-Broadway community and propel the independent theatre voice as an important contributor to the American stage.&quot;

Ben Brantley, theatre critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, has said that Wilson&#x27;s plays reflect &quot;disenchantment with the state of the nation...A couple plays, at least, featured embittered Vietnam veterans. At the same time, he harked back to the era of more sentimental plays – of portraits of losers on the margins of life.&quot; Wilson and Marshall W. Mason encouraged method acting and often used Constantin Stanislavski&#x27;s technique. In addition to John Malkovich, Judd Hirsch, Swoosie Kurtz, William Hurt, Jeff Daniels, David Morse, and Christopher Reeve were among the actors who starred in Wilson and Mason&#x27;s productions.

<doc id="38233" wikidata="Q810443" url="?curid=38233" title="Tannhäuser">
<text>Tannhäuser (; ), often stylized &quot;The Tannhäuser&quot;, was a German Minnesinger and traveling poet. Historically, his biography, including the dates he lived, is obscure beyond the poetry, which suggests he lived between 1245 and 1265.

His name becomes associated with a &quot;fairy queen&quot;–type folk ballad in German folklore of the 16th century.

==Historical Tannhäuser== 
The most common tradition has him as a descent from the &quot;Tanhusen&quot; family of Imperial &quot;ministeriales&quot;, documented in various 13th century sources, with their residence in the area of Neumarkt in the Bavarian Nordgau. These sources identify him as being descended of an Old Styrian noble family.

The illustrated &quot;Codex Manesse&quot; manuscript (about 1300–1340) depicts him clad in the Teutonic Order habit, suggesting he might have fought in the Sixth Crusade led by Emperor Frederick II in 1228/29. 
For a while, Tannhäuser was an active courtier at the court of the Austrian duke Frederick the Warlike, who ruled from 1230 to 1246. Frederick was the last of the Babenberg dukes; upon his death in the Battle of the Leitha River, Tannhäuser left the Vienna court.

Tannhäuser was a proponent of the &quot;leich&quot; (&quot;lai&quot;) style of minnesang and dance-song poetry. As literature, his poems parody the traditional genre with irony and hyperbole, somewhat similar to later commercium songs. However, his &quot;Bußlied&quot; (Poem on Atonement) is unusual, given the eroticism of the remaining &quot;Codex Manesse&quot;.

==Tannhäuser legend==

Based on his &quot;Bußlied&quot;, Tannhäuser became the subject of a legendary account. It makes Tannhäuser a knight and poet who found the Venusberg, the subterranean home of Venus, and spent a year there worshipping the goddess. After leaving the Venusberg, Tannhäuser is filled with remorse, and travels to Rome to ask Pope Urban IV (reigned 1261–1264) if it is possible to be absolved of his sins. Urban replies that forgiveness is impossible, as much as it would be for his papal staff to blossom. Three days after Tannhäuser&#x27;s departure, Urban&#x27;s staff bloomed with flowers; messengers are sent to retrieve the knight, but he has already returned to Venusberg, never to be seen again.

The earliest version of the narrative of the legend, not yet associated with name of Tannhäuser, is first recorded by the Provençal writer Antoine de la Sale (c. 1440) in his book La Salade. Here he narrates his visit to the town of Montemonaco in the Sibillini Mountains, Italy, and reports on the local legend of a fairy court hidden in a cave on the local mountains. La Sale personally visited the cave but did not delve into it past the entrance. He also reports the legend of an unnamed german knight who would have descended in the cave and lived there as one of the fairies&#x27; spouse, before coming back to seek forgiveness from the Pope. Despairing of not being forgiven for his sins, he would have returned to the fairies&#x27; cave to live eternally among them.

The association of this narrative with the name of Tannhäuser, appears to take place in the early 16th century. A German &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; folk ballad is recorded in numerous versions beginning around 1510.

The popularity of the ballad continues unabated well into the 17th century. 

The motif became most popular as the principal source for Richard Wagner&#x27;s large three-act opera &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; (1845), which changes a few story elements and is known for including a scandalous depiction of the revels of Venus&#x27;s court in its first scene. The plot of the opera covers both the &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; legend and the epic of the &quot;Sängerkrieg&quot; at Wartburg Castle.

<doc id="38234" wikidata="Q236829" url="?curid=38234" title="Diana Wynne Jones">
<text>Diana Wynne Jones (16 August 1934 – 26 March 2011) was a British novelist, poet, academic, literary critic, and short story writer. She principally wrote fantasy and speculative fiction novels for children and young adults. Although usually described as fantasy, some of her work also incorporates science fiction themes and elements of realism. Jones&#x27;s work often explores themes of time travel and parallel or multiple universes. Some of her better-known works are the &quot;Chrestomanci&quot; series, the &quot;Dalemark&quot; series, the three &quot;Moving Castle&quot; novels, &quot;Dark Lord of Derkholm&quot;, and &quot;The Tough Guide to Fantasyland&quot;.

Jones has been cited as an inspiration and muse for several fantasy and science fiction authors including Philip Pullman, Terry Pratchett, Penelope Lively, Robin McKinley, Dina Rabinovitch, Megan Whalen Turner, J.K. Rowling and Neil Gaiman, with Gaiman describing her as &quot;quite simply the best writer for children of her generation&quot;. Her work has been nominated for several awards. She was twice a finalist for the Hugo Award, nominated fourteen times for the Locus Award, seven times for the Mythopoeic Award (which she won twice), twice for a British Fantasy Award (won in 1999), and twice for a World Fantasy Award, which she won in 2007.

== Early life and marriage ==

Jones was born in London, the daughter of Marjorie (née Jackson) and Richard Aneurin Jones, both of whom were teachers. When war was announced, shortly after her fifth birthday, she was evacuated to Pontarddulais in Wales where her grandfather was a minister at a chapel. She did not live long in Wales due to a family dispute, and thereafter moved several times, including periods in the Lake District, in York, and back to London. In 1943 her family finally settled in Thaxted, Essex, where her parents worked running an educational conference centre. There, Jones and her two younger sisters Isobel (later Professor Isobel Armstrong, the literary critic) and Ursula (later an actress and a children&#x27;s writer) spent a childhood left chiefly to their own devices.

After attending Friends&#x27; School, Saffron Walden, she studied English at St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she attended lectures by both C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien before graduating in 1956. In the same year she married John Burrow, a prominent scholar of medieval literature, with whom she had three sons, Richard, Michael and Colin. After a brief period in London, in 1957 the couple returned to Oxford, where they stayed until moving to Bristol in 1976.

== Career ==

Jones started writing during the mid-1960s &quot;mostly to keep [her] sanity&quot;, when the youngest of her three children was about two years old and the family lived in a house owned by an Oxford college. Besides the children, she felt harried by the crises of adults in the household: a sick husband, a mother-in-law, a sister, and a friend with daughter. Her first book was a novel for adults published by Macmillan in 1970, entitled &quot;Changeover&quot;. It originated as the British Empire was divesting colonies; she recalled in 2004 that it had &quot;seemed like every month, we would hear that yet another small island or tiny country had been granted independence.&quot; &quot;Changeover&quot; is set in a fictional African colony during transition, and what begins as a memo about the problem of how to &quot;mark changeover&quot; ceremonially is misunderstood to be about the threat of a terrorist named Mark Changeover. It is a farce with a large cast of characters, featuring government, police, and army bureaucracies; sex, politics, and news. In 1965, when Rhodesia declared independence unilaterally (one of the last colonies and not tiny), &quot;I felt as if the book were coming true as I wrote it.&quot;

The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books are frequently compared to the works of Diana Wynne Jones. Many of her earlier children&#x27;s books were out of print in recent years, but have now been re-issued for the young audience whose interest in fantasy and reading was spurred by &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.

Jones&#x27;s works are also compared to those of Robin McKinley and Neil Gaiman. She was friends with both McKinley and Gaiman, and Jones and Gaiman were fans of each other&#x27;s work; she dedicated her 1993 novel &quot;Hexwood&quot; to him after something he said in conversation inspired a key part of the plot. Gaiman had already dedicated his 1991 four-part comic book mini-series &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; to &quot;four witches&quot;, of whom Jones was one.

For &quot;Charmed Life&quot;, the first Chrestomanci novel, Jones won the 1978 Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime award by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper that is judged by a panel of children&#x27;s writers. Three times she was a commended runner-up for the Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book: for &quot;Dogsbody&quot; (1975), &quot;Charmed Life&quot; (1977), and the fourth Chrestomanci book &quot;The Lives of Christopher Chant&quot; (1988). She won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, children&#x27;s section, in 1996 for &quot;The Crown of Dalemark&quot; (concluding that series) and in 1999 for &quot;Dark Lord of Derkholm&quot;; in four other years she was a finalist for the annual literary award by the Mythopoeic Society.

The 1986 novel &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; was inspired by a boy at a school she was visiting, who asked her to write a book called The Moving Castle. It was published first by Greenwillow in the U.S., where it was a runner-up for the annual Boston Globe–Horn Book Award in children&#x27;s fiction. In 2004, Hayao Miyazaki made the Japanese-language animated movie &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot;, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. A version dubbed in English was released in the UK and US in 2005, with the voice of Howl performed by Christian Bale. Next year Jones and the novel won the annual Phoenix Award from the Children&#x27;s Literature Association, recognising the best children&#x27;s book published twenty years earlier that did not win a major award (named for mythical bird phoenix to suggest the book&#x27;s rise from obscurity).

&quot;Fire and Hemlock&quot; had been the 2005 Phoenix runner-up. It is a novel based on Scottish ballads, and was a Mythopoeic Fantasy finalist in its own time.

&quot;Archer&#x27;s Goon&quot; (1984) was a runner-up for that year&#x27;s Horn Book Award. It was adapted for television in 1992. One Jones fansite believes it to be &quot;the only tv adaptation (so far) of one of Diana&#x27;s books&quot;.

Jones&#x27;s book on clichés in fantasy fiction, &quot;The Tough Guide To Fantasyland&quot; (nonfiction), has a cult following among writers and critics, despite initially being difficult to find due to an erratic printing history. It was reissued in the UK, and has been reissued in the United States in 2006 by Firebird Books. The Firebird edition has additional material and a completely new design, including a new map.

The British Fantasy Society recognised her significant impact on fantasy with its Karl Edward Wagner Award in 1999. She received an honorary D.Litt from the University of Bristol in July 2006 and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2007.

In August 2014, Google commemorated Jones with a Google Doodle created by Google artist Sophie Diao.

== Illness and death ==

Jones was diagnosed with lung cancer in the early summer of 2009. She underwent surgery in July and reported to friends that the procedure had been successful. However, in June 2010 she announced that she would be discontinuing chemotherapy because it only made her feel ill. In mid-2010 she was halfway through a new book with plans for another to follow. She died on 26 March 2011 from the disease. 

The story in progress when she became too ill to write, &quot;The Islands of Chaldea&quot;, was completed by her sister Ursula Jones in 2014.
Interviewed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in June 2013 after she finished the Chaldea story, Ursula Jones said that &quot;other things were coming to light ... She left behind a mass of stuff.&quot; In 2013 another book was published posthumously, &quot;Vile Visitors.&quot;

<doc id="38235" wikidata="Q220340" url="?curid=38235" title="Parsifal">
<text>Parsifal (WWV 111) is a music drama in three acts by the German composer Richard Wagner and his last composition. Wagner&#x27;s own libretto for the work is freely based on the 13th-century Middle High German chivalric romance &quot;Parzival&quot; of the &quot;Minnesänger&quot; Wolfram von Eschenbach and the Old French chivalric romance &quot;Perceval ou le Conte du Graal&quot; by the 12th-century &quot;trouvère&quot; Chrétien de Troyes, recounting different accounts of the story of the Arthurian knight Parzival (Percival) and his spiritual quest for the Holy Grail.

Wagner conceived the work in April 1857, but did not finish it until 25 years later. In composing it he took advantage of the particular acoustics of his newly built Bayreuth Festspielhaus. &quot;Parsifal&quot; was first produced at the second Bayreuth Festival in 1882. The Bayreuth Festival maintained a monopoly on &quot;Parsifal&quot; productions until 1903, when the opera was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.

Wagner described &quot;Parsifal&quot; not as an opera, but as (a sacred festival stage play). At Bayreuth a tradition has arisen that audiences do not applaud at the end of the first act. The autograph manuscript of the work is preserved in the Richard Wagner Foundation.

==Composition==
Wagner read von Eschenbach&#x27;s poem &quot;Parzival&quot; while taking the waters at Marienbad in 1845. After encountering Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s writings in 1854, Wagner became interested in Indian philosophies, especially Buddhism. Out of this interest came &quot;Die Sieger&quot; (&quot;The Victors&quot;, 1856), a sketch Wagner wrote for an opera based on a story from the life of Buddha. The themes of self-renunciation, rebirth, compassion, and even exclusive social groups (castes in , the knights of the Grail in Parsifal) which were later explored in &quot;Parsifal&quot; were first introduced in .

According to his autobiography , Wagner conceived &quot;Parsifal&quot; on Good Friday morning, April 1857, in the (German: &quot;Asylum&quot;), the small cottage on Otto Wesendonck&#x27;s estate in the Zürich suburb of Enge, which Wesendonck – a wealthy silk merchant and generous patron of the arts – had placed at Wagner&#x27;s disposal, through the good offices of his wife Mathilde Wesendonck. The composer and his wife Minna had moved into the cottage on 28 April:

However, as his second wife Cosima Wagner later reported on 22 April 1879, this account had been colored by a certain amount of poetic licence:
The work may indeed have been conceived at Wesendonck&#x27;s cottage in the last week of April 1857, but Good Friday that year fell on 10 April, when the Wagners were still living at Zeltweg 13 in Zürich. If the prose sketch which Wagner mentions in was accurately dated (and most of Wagner&#x27;s surviving papers are dated), it could settle the issue once and for all, but unfortunately it has not survived.

Wagner did not resume work on &quot;Parsifal&quot; for eight years, during which time he completed &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and began &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. Then, between 27 and 30 August 1865, he took up &quot;Parsifal&quot; again and made a prose draft of the work; this contains a fairly brief outline of the plot and a considerable amount of detailed commentary on the characters and themes of the drama. But once again the work was dropped and set aside for another eleven and a half years. During this time most of Wagner&#x27;s creative energy was devoted to the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, which was finally completed in 1874 and given its first full performance at Bayreuth in August 1876. Only when this gargantuan task had been accomplished did Wagner find the time to concentrate on &quot;Parsifal&quot;. By 23 February 1877 he had completed a second and more extensive prose draft of the work, and by 19 April of the same year he had transformed this into a verse libretto (or &quot;poem&quot;, as Wagner liked to call his libretti).

In September 1877 he began the music by making two complete drafts of the score from beginning to end. The first of these (known in German as the and in English as either the &quot;preliminary draft&quot; or the &quot;first complete draft&quot;) was made in pencil on three staves, one for the voices and two for the instruments. The second complete draft (, &quot;orchestral draft&quot;, &quot;short score&quot; or &quot;particell&quot;) was made in ink and on at least three, but sometimes as many as five, staves. This draft was much more detailed than the first and contained a considerable degree of instrumental elaboration.

The second draft was begun on 25 September 1877, just a few days after the first; at this point in his career Wagner liked to work on both drafts simultaneously, switching back and forth between the two so as not to allow too much time to elapse between his initial setting of the text and the final elaboration of the music. The of act 3 was completed on 16 April 1879 and the on the 26th of the same month.

The full score () was the final stage in the compositional process. It was made in ink and consisted of a fair copy of the entire opera, with all the voices and instruments properly notated according to standard practice. Wagner composed &quot;Parsifal&quot; one act at a time, completing the and of each act before beginning the &quot;Gesamtentwurf&quot; of the next act; but because the already embodied all the compositional details of the full score, the actual drafting of the was regarded by Wagner as little more than a routine task which could be done whenever he found the time. The prelude of act 1 was scored in August 1878. The rest of the opera was scored between August 1879 and 13 January 1882.

==Performance history==
===Premiere===
On 12 November 1880, Wagner conducted a private performance of the prelude for his patron Ludwig II of Bavaria at the Court Theatre in Munich. The premiere of the entire work was given in the Bayreuth Festspielhaus on 26 July 1882 conducted by the Jewish-German conductor Hermann Levi. Stage designs were by Max Brückner and Paul von Joukowsky, who took their lead from Wagner himself. The Grail hall was based on the interior of Siena Cathedral which Wagner had visited in 1880, while Klingsor&#x27;s magic garden was modelled on those at the Palazzo Rufolo in Ravello. In July and August 1882 sixteen performances of the work were given in Bayreuth conducted by Levi and Franz Fischer. The production boasted an orchestra of 107, a chorus of 135 and 23 soloists (with the main parts being double cast). At the last of these performances, Wagner took the baton from Levi and conducted the final scene of act 3 from the orchestral interlude to the end.

At the first performances of &quot;Parsifal&quot;, problems with the moving scenery (the ) during the transition from scene 1 to scene 2 in act 1 meant that Wagner&#x27;s existing orchestral interlude finished before Parsifal and Gurnemanz arrived at the hall of the Grail. Engelbert Humperdinck, who was assisting the production, provided a few extra bars of music to cover this gap. In subsequent years this problem was solved and Humperdinck&#x27;s additions were not used.

===Ban outside Bayreuth===

For the first twenty years of its existence, the only staged performances of &quot;Parsifal&quot; took place in the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, the venue for which Wagner conceived the work (except eight private performances for Ludwig II at Munich in 1884 and 1885). Wagner had two reasons for wanting to keep &quot;Parsifal&quot; exclusively for the Bayreuth stage. First, he wanted to prevent it from degenerating into &#x27;mere amusement&#x27; for an opera-going public. Only at Bayreuth could his last work be presented in the way envisaged by him—a tradition maintained by his wife, Cosima, long after his death. Second, he thought that the opera would provide an income for his family after his death if Bayreuth had the monopoly on its performance.

The Bayreuth authorities allowed unstaged performances to take place in various countries after Wagner&#x27;s death (London in 1884, New York City in 1886, and Amsterdam in 1894) but they maintained an embargo on stage performances outside Bayreuth. On 24 December 1903, after receiving a court ruling that performances in the United States could not be prevented by Bayreuth, the New York Metropolitan Opera staged the complete opera, using many Bayreuth-trained singers. Cosima barred anyone involved in the New York production from working at Bayreuth in future performances. Unauthorized stage performances were also undertaken in Amsterdam in 1905, 1906 and 1908. There was a performance in Buenos Aires, in the Teatro Coliseo, on June 20, 1913, under Gino Marinuzzi.

Bayreuth lifted its monopoly on &quot;Parsifal&quot; on 1 January 1914 in the Teatro Comunale di Bologna in Bologna with Giuseppe Borgatti. Some opera houses began their performances at midnight between 31 December 1913 and 1 January. The first authorized performance was staged at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona: it began at 10:30pm Barcelona time, which was an hour behind Bayreuth. Such was the demand for &quot;Parsifal&quot; that it was presented in more than 50 European opera houses between 1 January and 1 August 1914.

===Applause===
At Bayreuth performances audiences do not applaud at the end of the first act. This tradition is the result of a misunderstanding arising from Wagner&#x27;s desire at the premiere to maintain the serious mood of the opera. After much applause following the first and second acts, Wagner spoke to the audience and said that the cast would take no curtain calls until the end of the performance. This confused the audience, who remained silent at the end of the opera until Wagner addressed them again, saying that he did not mean that they could not applaud. After the performance Wagner complained, &quot;Now I don&#x27;t know. Did the audience like it or not?&quot; At subsequent performances some believed that Wagner had wanted no applause until the very end, and there was silence after the first two acts. Eventually it became a Bayreuth tradition that no applause would be heard after the first act, but this was certainly not Wagner&#x27;s idea. In fact, during the first Bayreuth performances, Wagner himself cried &quot;Bravo!&quot; as the flowermaidens made their exit in the second act, only to be hissed by other members of the audience. At some theatres other than Bayreuth, applause and curtain calls are normal practice after every act. Program notes until 2013 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York asked the audience not to applaud after act 1.

===Post-war performances===
&quot;Parsifal&quot; is one of the Wagner operas regularly presented at the Bayreuth Festival to this day. Among the more significant post-war productions was that directed in 1951 by Wieland Wagner, the composer&#x27;s grandson. At the first Bayreuth Festival after World War II he presented a radical move away from literal representation of the hall of the Grail or the flowermaiden&#x27;s bower. Instead, lighting effects and the bare minimum of scenery were used to complement Wagner&#x27;s music. This production was heavily influenced by the ideas of the Swiss stage designer Adolphe Appia. The reaction to this production was extreme: Ernest Newman, Richard Wagner&#x27;s biographer described it as &quot;not only the best &quot;Parsifal&quot; I have ever seen and heard, but one of the three or four most moving spiritual experiences of my life&quot;. Others were appalled that Wagner&#x27;s stage directions were being flouted. The conductor of the 1951 production, Hans Knappertsbusch, on being asked how he could conduct such a disgraceful travesty, declared that right up until the dress rehearsal he imagined that the stage decorations were still to come. Knappertsbusch was particularly upset by the omission of the dove that appears over Parsifal&#x27;s head at the end of the opera, which he claimed inspired him to give better performances. To placate his conductor Wieland arranged to reinstate the dove, which descended on a string. What Knappertsbusch did not realise was that Wieland had made the length of the string long enough for the conductor to see the dove, but not for the audience. Wieland continued to modify and refine his Bayreuth production of Parsifal until his death in 1966. Martha Mödl created a &quot;complex, tortured Kundry in Wieland Wagner&#x27;s revolutionary production of Parsifal during the festival&#x27;s first postwar season&quot;, and would remain the company&#x27;s exclusive Kundry for the remainder of the decade.

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===

Prelude to act 1

Musical introduction to the work with a duration of c. 12–16 minutes.

&quot;Scene 1&quot;

In a forest near the seat of the Grail and its knights, Gurnemanz, an elder knight of the Grail, wakes his young squires and leads them in morning prayer (&quot;He! Ho! Waldhüter ihr&quot;). Their king, Amfortas, has been stabbed by the Holy Spear, once bequeathed to him into his guardianship, and the wound will not heal.

Kundry arrives in a frenzy, with soothing balsam from Arabia. The squires eye Kundry with mistrust and question her. They believe Kundry to be an evil pagan witch. Gurnemanz restrains them and defends her. He relates history of Amfortas and the spear; it was stolen from him by the failed knight Klingsor.

Gurnemanz&#x27;s squires ask how it is that he knew Klingsor. Gurnemanz tells them that Klingsor was once a respected knight, but, unable to cleanse himself of sin, castrated himself in an effort to attain purity, but instead became an evil monstrosity.

Parsifal enters, carrying a swan which he has killed. Shocked, Gurnemanz speaks sternly to the lad, saying that this land is a holy place, not to be defiled by murder. Remorsefully the young man breaks his bow in agitation and casts it aside. Kundry tells him that she has seen that his mother has died. Parsifal, who cannot remember much of his past, is crestfallen.

Gurnemanz wonders if Parsifal might be the predicted &quot;pure fool&quot;; he invites Parsifal to witness the Ceremony of the Uncovering of the Grail, which renews the knights&#x27; immortality.

Orchestral interlude – &quot;Verwandlungsmusik&quot; (&quot;Transformation music&quot;)

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

The voice of the retired king Titurel resounds from a vaulted crypt in the background, demanding that his son Amfortas uncover the Grail and serve his kingly office (&quot;Mein Sohn Amfortas, bist du am Amt?&quot;). Only through the immortality-conferring power of the sacred chalice and the Saviour&#x27;s blood contained therein may Titurel himself, now aged and very feeble, live on. Amfortas is overcome with shame and suffering (&quot;Wehvolles Erbe, dem ich verfallen&quot;). He, the chosen guardian of the holiest of relics, has succumbed to sin and lost the Holy Spear, suffering an ever-bleeding wound in the process; uncovering the Grail causes him great pain. The young man appears to suffer with him, clutching convulsively at his heart. The knights and Titurel urge Amfortas to reveal the Grail (&quot;Enthüllet den Gral!&quot;), and he finally does. The dark hall is illuminated by its radiant light and the round table of the knights is miraculously filled with wine and bread. Slowly all the knights and squires disappear, leaving Gurnemanz and the youth alone. Gurnemanz asks the youth if he has understood what he has seen. As the boy is unable to answer the question, Gurnemanz dismisses him as just an ordinary fool after all and angrily exiles him from the realm with a warning to let the swans in the Grail Kingdom live in peace.

===Act 2===

Prelude to act 2 – &quot;Klingsors Zauberschloss&quot; (&quot;Klingsor&#x27;s Magic Castle&quot;)

Musical introduction of c. 2–3 minutes.

&quot;Scene 1&quot;

Klingsor&#x27;s castle and enchanted garden. Waking her from her sleep, Klingsor conjures up Kundry, now transformed into an incredibly alluring woman. He calls her by many names: First Sorceress (), Hell&#x27;s Rose (), Herodias, Gundryggia and, lastly, Kundry. She mocks his self-castrated condition but cannot resist his power. He resolves to send her to seduce Parsifal and ruin him as she ruined Amfortas before.

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

The youth walks into a wondrous garden, surrounded by beautiful and seductive flowermaidens. They call to him and entwine themselves about him while chiding him for wounding their lovers (), yet the boy in his childlike innocent naïveté doesn&#x27;t comprehend their temptations and shows only little interest in them. The flowermaidens soon fight and bicker among themselves to win his devotion, to the point that he is about to flee, but a different voice suddenly calls out &quot;Parsifal!&quot;. The youth finally recalls this name is what his mother called him when she appeared in his dreams. The flowermaidens back away from him and call him a fool as they leave him and Kundry alone.

Parsifal wonders if the whole Garden is but a dream and asks how it is that Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father&#x27;s fate, the mother he had abandoned and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal&#x27;s history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother&#x27;s death. Kundry tells him that this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand the love that had once united his parents, wanting thus to awake in Parsifal the first pangs of desire. However, as she kisses Parsifal, the youth suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas&#x27; name: having just felt for the first time material desire with Kundry&#x27;s kiss, Parsifal finds himself in the same position in which Amfortas had been seduced and he feels the wounded king&#x27;s pain and suffering of evil and sin burning in his own soul. Only now does Parsifal understand Amfortas&#x27; passion during the Grail Ceremony ().

Furious that her ploy has failed, Kundry tells Parsifal that if he can feel compassion for Amfortas, then he should also be able to feel it for her. In a distant past, she saw the Redeemer and mockingly laughed at His pains in malice. As a punishment for this sin she has been cursed and bound by Klingsor and has fallen under his yoke. The curse condemns her to never be able to die and find peace and redemption. She cannot weep, only jeer diabolically. Longing for deliverance, she has been waiting for ages for a man to free her from her curse and yearns to once more meet the Saviour&#x27;s forgiving gaze, but her search for her redeemer in the end only ever turns into a desire to find her salvation in earthly desire with those who fall for her charms. All her penitent endeavours eventually transform into a renewed life of sin and a continued unredeemed existence in bondage to Klingsor. When Parsifal still resists her, Kundry curses him through the power of her own accursed being to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail again, and finally calls on her master Klingsor to help her.

Klingsor appears on the castle rampart and hurls the Holy Spear at Parsifal to destroy him. He seizes the spear in his hand and makes with it the sign of the Cross, banishing Klingsor&#x27;s dark sorcery. The whole castle with Klingsor himself suddenly sinks as if by terrible earthquake and the enchanted garden withers. As Parsifal leaves, he tells Kundry that she knows where she can find him.

===Act 3===

Prelude to act 3 – &quot;Parsifals Irrfahrt&quot; (&quot;Parsifal&#x27;s Wandering&quot;)

Musical introduction of c. 4–6 minutes.

&quot;Scene 1&quot;

The scene takes place many years later. Gurnemanz is now aged and bent, living alone as a hermit. It is Good Friday. He hears moaning near his hut and finds Kundry lying unconscious in the brush, similarly as he had many years before (&quot;Sie! Wieder da!&quot;). He revives her using water from the Holy Spring, but she will only speak the word &quot;serve&quot; (&quot;Dienen&quot;). Looking into the forest, Gurnemanz sees a figure approaching, armed and in full armour. The stranger removes his helmet and Gurnemanz recognizes the lad who shot the swan; to his amazement the knight also bears the Holy Spear.

Kundry washes Parsifal&#x27;s feet and Gurnemanz anoints him with water from the Holy Spring, recognizing him as the pure fool, now enlightened by compassion and freed from guilt through purifying suffering, and proclaims him the foretold new king of the knights of the Grail.

Parsifal looks about and comments on the beauty of the meadow. Gurnemanz explains that today is Good Friday, when all the world is purified and renewed.

A dark orchestral interlude leads into the solemn gathering of the knights.

Orchestral interlude – &quot;Verwandlungsmusik&quot; (&quot;Transformation music&quot;) – &quot;Titurels Totenfeier&quot; (&quot;Titurel&#x27;s Funeral March&quot;)

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

Within the Castle of the Grail, Titurel&#x27;s funeral is to take place. Mourning processions of knights bring the deceased Titurel in a coffin and the Grail in its shrine, as well as Amfortas on his litter, to the Grail hall (). The knights desperately urge Amfortas to keep his promise and at least once more, for the very last time uncover the Grail again, but Amfortas, in a frenzy, says he will never again show the Grail, as doing so would just prolong his unbearable torment. Instead, he commands the knights to kill him and end with his suffering also the shame he has brought on the brotherhood. At this moment, Parsifal appears and declares only one weapon can help here: only the same spear that inflicted the wound can now close it (). He touches Amfortas&#x27; side with the Holy Spear and both heals the wound and absolves him from sin. The spear, now reunited with the Holy Grail, starts to bleed with the same divine blood that is contained within the sacred chalice. Extolling the virtue of compassion and blessing Amfortas&#x27; suffering for making a pure fool knowing, Parsifal replaces Amfortas in his kingly office and orders to unveil the Grail, which is never to be hidden again. As the Grail glows ever brighter with light and a white dove descends from the top of the dome and hovers over Parsifal&#x27;s head, a &quot;chorus mysticus&quot; of all the knights praises the miracle of salvation () and proclaims the redemption of the Redeemer (). Kundry, also at the very last released from her curse and redeemed, slowly sinks lifeless to the ground with her gaze resting on Parsifal, who raises the Grail in blessing over the worshipping knighthood.

==Reactions==
Since &quot;Parsifal&quot; could initially only be seen at the Bayreuth Festival, the first presentation in 1882 was attended by many notable figures. Reaction was varied. Some thought that &quot;Parsifal&quot; marked a weakening of Wagner&#x27;s abilities, many others saw the work as a crowning achievement. The famous critic and Wagner&#x27;s theoretical opponent Eduard Hanslick gave his opinion that &quot;The Third act may be counted the most unified and the most atmospheric. It is not the richest musically,&quot; going on to note: &quot;And Wagner&#x27;s creative powers? For a man of his age and his method they are astounding&quot;. But &quot;It would be foolishness to declare that Wagner&#x27;s fantasy, and specifically his musical invention, has retained the freshness and facility of yore. One cannot help but discern sterility and prosaicism, together with increasing longwindedness.&quot;

The conductor Felix Weingartner found that: &quot;The flowermaidens&#x27; costumes showed extraordinary lack of taste, but the singing was incomparable… When the curtain had been rung down on the final scene and we were walking down the hill, I seemed to hear the words of Goethe &#x27;and you can say you were present&#x27;. The &quot;Parsifal&quot; performances of 1882 were artistic events of supreme interest and it is my pride and joy that I participated in them.&quot; Many contemporary composers shared Weingartner&#x27;s opinion. Hugo Wolf was a student at the time of the 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see &quot;Parsifal&quot; twice. He emerged overwhelmed: &quot;Colossal – Wagner&#x27;s most inspired, sublimest creation.&quot; He reiterated this view in a postcard from Bayreuth in 1883: &quot;&quot;Parsifal&quot; is without doubt by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of Art.&quot;

Gustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend: &quot;I can hardly describe my present state to you. When I came out of the Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to me, and that I would carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life.&quot; Max Reger, in a later account, simply noted that &quot;When I first heard &quot;Parsifal&quot; at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician.&quot; That was in 1888. Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894, said: &quot;Nothing in the world has made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed… I cannot begin to tell you how &quot;Parsifal&quot; has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side. is really something.&quot; 

Claude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was: &quot;Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. &quot;Parsifal&quot; is one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music.&quot; He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera &quot;Pelléas et Melisande&quot; because he had discovered in the music for it &quot;the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner&quot;. Alban Berg described &quot;Parsifal&quot; in 1909 as &quot;magnificent, overwhelming&quot;. 

However, some notable guests of the Festival took a more acerbic view of the experience. Mark Twain visited Bayreuth in 1891: &quot;I was not able to detect in the vocal parts of &quot;Parsifal&quot; anything that might with confidence be called rhythm or tune or melody… Singing! It does seem the wrong name to apply to it… In &quot;Parsifal&quot; there is a hermit named Gurnemanz who stands on the stage in one spot and practices by the hour, while first one and then another of the cast endures what he can of it and then retires to die.&quot; Performance standards may have contributed to such reactions; George Bernard Shaw, a committed Wagnerite, commented in 1894 that: &quot;The opening performance of &quot;Parsifal&quot; this season was, from the purely musical point of view, as far as the principal singers were concerned, simply an abomination. The bass howled, the tenor bawled, the baritone sang flat and the soprano, when she condescended to sing at all and did not merely shout her words, screamed…&quot;

During a break from composing &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, Igor Stravinsky traveled to the Bayreuth Festival at the invitation of Sergei Diaghilev to see the work. Stravinsky was repulsed by the &quot;quasi-religious atmosphere&quot; of the festival. Stravinsky&#x27;s repulsion is speculated to be due to his agnosticism, of which he recanted later in life.

==Interpretation and influence==
Wagner&#x27;s last work, &quot;Parsifal&quot; has been both influential and controversial. The use of Christian symbols in &quot;Parsifal&quot; (the Grail, the spear, references to the Redeemer) together with its restriction to Bayreuth for almost 30 years sometimes led to performances being regarded almost as a religious rite. However, Wagner never actually refers to Jesus Christ by name in the opera, only to &quot;The Redeemer&quot;. In his essay &quot;Religion and Art&quot;, Wagner described the use of Christian imagery thus:

The critic Eduard Hanslick objected to the religious air surrounding &quot;Parsifal&quot; even at the premiere: &quot;The question of whether &quot;Parsifal&quot; should really be withheld from all theatres and limited to... Bayreuth was naturally on all tongues... I must state here that the church scenes in &quot;Parsifal&quot; did not make the offensive impression on me that others and I had been led to expect from reading the libretto. They are religious situations – but for all their earnest dignity they are not in the style of the church, but completely in the style of the opera. &quot;Parsifal&quot; is an opera, call it a &#x27;stage festival&#x27; or &#x27;consecrational stage festival&#x27; if you will.&quot;

===Schopenhauer===
Wagner had been greatly impressed with his reading of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected his thoughts and practice on music and art. Most writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see &quot;Parsifal&quot; as Wagner&#x27;s last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest manifestation of human morality. Moreover, Parsifal displays compassion in the face of sexual temptation (act 2, scene 2); Schopenhauerian philosophy suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of human life is through negation of the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation of the Will. Schopenhauer also claims that compassion should be extended to non-human sentient beings as well, supporting this claim by the lives of Christian saints and mystics and the Indian religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. This worldview finds in &quot;Parsifal&quot; its expression in the holy status of animals within the Kingdom of the Grail, in the shocked response to Parsifal&#x27;s &quot;murder&quot; of the swan (act 1, scene 1), which awakens in the youth the first unaware throb of compassion, or in Gurnemanz&#x27;s &quot;sermon&quot; about the &quot;Good Friday Spell&quot; affecting nature and humanity&#x27;s relation towards nature (act 3, scene 1). Wagner himself in his older age became an advocate of vegetarianism and an opponent of vivisection, participating in an anti-vivisectionist petition to the Reichstag in 1879; he also professed what might be called early environmentalist sentiments. As the exact opposite of compassion and therefore as the ultimate moral evil Schopenhauer sees the act of &quot;Schadenfreude&quot;, the enjoying of the suffering of another living being; it is precisely this sin of which Kundry is guilty when she maliciously laughs in mocking pride at the sufferings of the Redeemer and as a result of which she falls under Klingsor&#x27;s curse (recounted in act 2, scene 2), broken only at the moment when she is again capable to weep and thus express compassion during the &quot;Good Friday Spell&quot; (act 3, scene 1). When viewed in this light, &quot;Parsifal&quot;, with its emphasis on &quot;Mitleid&quot; (&quot;compassion&quot;) is a natural follow-on to &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, where Schopenhauer&#x27;s influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on &quot;Sehnen&quot; (&quot;yearning&quot;). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of &quot;Tristan&quot;, but later rejected the idea.

===Nietzsche===
Friedrich Nietzsche, who was originally a champion of Wagner and Schopenhauer, chose later to use &quot;Parsifal&quot; as the ground for his breach with Wagner. Nietzsche took the work as an exemplar of the self-denying, life-denying, and otherworldly Christian slave morality motivated by the &quot;will to nothingness,&quot; as opposed to the self-affirming and earthly master morality of pre-Christian ruling classes and the strong motivated by the &quot;will to power.&quot; An extended critique of &quot;Parsifal&quot; opens the third essay (&quot;What Is the Meaning of Ascetic Ideals?&quot;) of &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot;. In &quot;Nietzsche contra Wagner&quot; he wrote: 
Despite this attack on the subject matter, he also admitted that the music was sublime: &quot;Moreover, apart from all irrelevant questions (as to what the use of this music can or ought to be) and on purely aesthetic grounds; has Wagner ever done anything better?&quot; (Letter to Peter Gast, 1887).

===Racism debate===

Some writers see in the opera a promotion of racism or antisemitism. One line of argument suggests that &quot;Parsifal&quot; was written in support of the ideas of the French diplomat and racial theorist Count Arthur de Gobineau, expressed most extensively in his &quot;Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot;. Parsifal is proposed as the &quot;pure-blooded&quot; (i.e. Aryan) hero who overcomes Klingsor, who is perceived as a Jewish stereotype, particularly since he opposes the quasi-Christian knights of the Grail. Such claims remain heavily debated, since there is nothing explicit in the libretto to support them. Wagner never mentions such ideas in his many writings, and Cosima Wagner&#x27;s diaries, which relate in great detail Wagner&#x27;s thoughts over the last 14 years of his life (including the period covering the composition and first performance of &quot;Parsifal&quot;) never mention any such intention. Having met Gobineau for the first time very briefly in 1876, it was nonetheless only in 1880 that Wagner read Gobineau&#x27;s essay. However, the libretto for &quot;Parsifal&quot; had already been completed by 1877, and the original drafts of the story even date back to 1857. Besides the question of chronology, an eventual meeting in person between Wagner and Gobineau was also accompanied by mutual disagreements and quarrels; e.g., on 3 June 1881 Wagner is reported to have &quot;exploded in favour of Christian theories in contrast to racial ones&quot;. Despite this, Gobineau is sometimes cited as an inspiration for &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

The related question of whether the opera contains a specifically antisemitic message is also debated. Some of Wagner&#x27;s contemporaries and commentators (e.g. Hans von Wolzogen and Ernest Newman) who analysed &quot;Parsifal&quot; at length, make no mention of any antisemitic interpretations. However the critics Paul Lindau and Max Nordbeck, present at the world premiere, noted in their reviews how the work accorded with Wagner&#x27;s anti-Jewish sentiments. Similar interpretive conflict continues even today; some of the more recent commentators continue to highlight the perceived antisemitic or anti-Judaic nature of the opera, and find correspondences with antisemitic passages found in Wagner&#x27;s writings and articles of the period, while others deny such claims, seeing for example the opposition between the realm of the Grail and Klingsor&#x27;s domain as portraying a conflict between the sphere embodying the world-view of Wagner&#x27;s Schopenhauerian Christianity and a pagan sphere more generally.

The conductor of the premiere was Hermann Levi, the court conductor at the Munich Opera. Since King Ludwig was sponsoring the production, much of the orchestra was drawn from the ranks of the Munich Opera, including the conductor. Wagner objected to &quot;Parsifal&quot; being conducted by a Jew (Levi&#x27;s father was in fact a rabbi). Wagner first suggested that Levi should convert to Christianity, which Levi declined to do. Wagner then wrote to King Ludwig that he had decided to accept Levi despite the fact that (he alleged) he had received complaints that &quot;of all pieces, this most Christian of works&quot; should be conducted by a Jew. When the King expressed his satisfaction at this, replying that &quot;human beings are basically all brothers&quot;, Wagner wrote to the king angrily: &quot;If I have friendly and sympathetic dealings with many of these people, it is only because I consider the Jewish race as the born enemy of pure humanity and all that is noble about it (sic)&quot;. Seventy-one years later, the Jewish bass-baritone George London performed in the role of Amfortas at &quot;Neu Bayreuth&quot;, causing some controversy.

It has been claimed that &quot;Parsifal&quot; was denounced as being &quot;ideologically unacceptable&quot; in Nazi Germany and that the Nazis placed a de facto ban on &quot;Parsifal&quot; because of what many scholars see as the presence of themes such as compassion, Schopenhauerian negation of the will, renunciation of desires, asceticism and even non-violence and anti-militarism in the work&#x27;s libretto. Some of the Nazi officials and leaders may have had certain doubts about the work. In his 1930 book &quot;The Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot; the Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg expressed the view that &quot;&quot;Parsifal&quot; represents a church-influenced enfeeblement in favour of the value of renunciation&quot;. According to Joseph Goebbels&#x27; diaries, Adolf Hitler too had apparently some reservations about &quot;Parsifal&quot;, particularly about what he called its &quot;Christian mystical style&quot;. Despite this, there were in fact 26 performances at the Bayreuth Festival between 1934 and 1939 and 23 performances at the Deutsche Oper Berlin between 1939 and 1942. However, &quot;Parsifal&quot; was not performed at Bayreuth during World War II, a significant omission since the work, with the exception of one year, had been an annual fixture of the Festival since 1882.

==Music==
===Leitmotifs===
A &quot;leitmotif&quot; is a recurring musical theme within a particular piece of music, associated with a particular character, object, event or emotion. Wagner is the composer most often associated with leitmotifs, and &quot;Parsifal&quot; makes liberal use of them. Wagner did not specifically identify or name leitmotifs in the score of &quot;Parsifal&quot; (any more than he did in any other of his scores), although his wife Cosima mentions statements he made about some of them in her diary. However, Wagner&#x27;s followers (notably Hans von Wolzogen whose guide to &quot;Parsifal&quot; was published in 1882) named, wrote about and made references to these motifs, and they were highlighted in piano arrangements of the score. Wagner&#x27;s own reaction to such naming of motifs in the score was one of disgust: &quot;In the end people believe that such nonsense happens by my suggestion.&quot;

The opening prelude introduces two important leitmotifs, generally referred to as the &quot;Communion&quot; theme and the theme of the &quot;Grail&quot;. These two, and Parsifal&#x27;s own motif, are repeated during the course of the opera. Other characters, especially Klingsor, Amfortas, and &quot;The Voice&quot;, which sings the so-called &quot;Tormotif&quot; (&quot;Fool&#x27;s motive&quot;), have their own particular leitmotifs. Wagner uses the Dresden amen to represent the Grail, this motif being a sequence of notes he would have known since his childhood in Dresden.

===Chromaticism===
Many music theorists have used &quot;Parsifal&quot; to explore difficulties in analyzing the chromaticism of late 19th century music. Theorists such as David Lewin and Richard Cohn have explored the importance of certain pitches and harmonic progressions both in structuring and symbolizing the work. The unusual harmonic progressions in the leitmotifs which structure the piece, as well as the heavy chromaticism of act 2, make it a difficult work to parse musically.

===Notable excerpts===
As is common in mature Wagner operas, &quot;Parsifal&quot; was composed such that each act was a continuous flow of music; hence there are no free-standing arias in the work. However, a number of orchestral excerpts from the opera were arranged by Wagner himself, and remain in the concert repertory. The prelude to act 1 is frequently performed either alone or in conjunction with an arrangement of the &quot;Good Friday&quot; music which accompanies the second half of act 3, scene 1. Kundry&#x27;s long solo in act 2 (&quot;) is occasionally performed in concert, as is Amfortas&#x27; lament from act 1 (&quot;).

===Instrumentation===
The score for &quot;Parsifal&quot; calls for three flutes, three oboes, one English horn, three clarinets in B-flat and A, one bass clarinet in B-flat and A, three bassoons, one contrabassoon; four horns in F, three trumpets in F, three trombones, one tuba, 6 onstage trumpets in F, 6 onstage trombones; a percussion section that includes four timpani (requiring two players), tenor drums, 4 onstage church bells, one onstage thunder machine; two harps and strings. &quot;Parsifal&quot; is one of only two works by Wagner in which he used the contrabassoon. (The other is the &quot;Symphony in C&quot;.)

The bells that draw the knights to the Grail ceremony at Monsalvat in acts 1 and 3 have often proved problematic to stage. For the earlier performances of &quot;Parsifal&quot; in Bayreuth, Wagner had the Parsifal bell, a piano frame with four strings, constructed as a substitute for church bells. For the first performances, the bells were combined with tam-tam and gongs. However, the bell was used with the tuba, four tam-tams tuned to the pitch of the four chime notes and another tam-tam on which a roll is executed by using a drumstick. In modern-day performances, the Parsifal bell has been replaced with tubular bells or synthesizers to produce the desired notes. The thunder machine is used in the moment of the destruction of Klingsor&#x27;s castle.

===Recordings===

&quot;Parsifal&quot; was expressly composed for the stage at Bayreuth and many of the most famous recordings of the opera come from live performances on that stage. In the pre-LP era, Karl Muck conducted excerpts from the opera at Bayreuth. These are still considered some of the best performances of the opera on disc. They also contain the only sound evidence of the bells constructed for the work&#x27;s premiere, which were melted down for scrap during World War II.

Hans Knappertsbusch was the conductor most closely associated with &quot;Parsifal&quot; at Bayreuth in the post-war years, and the performances under his baton in 1951 marked the re-opening of the Bayreuth Festival after World War II. These historic performances were recorded and are available on the Teldec label in mono sound. Knappertsbusch recorded the opera again for Philips in 1962 in stereo, and this release is often considered to be the classic &quot;Parsifal&quot; recording. There are also many &quot;unofficial&quot; live recordings from Bayreuth, capturing virtually every &quot;Parsifal&quot; cast ever conducted by Knappertsbusch. Pierre Boulez (1971) and James Levine (1985) have also made recordings of the opera at Bayreuth that were released on Deutsche Grammophon and Philips. The Boulez recording is one of the fastest on record, and the Levine one of the slowest.

Amongst other recordings, those conducted by Georg Solti, James Levine (with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra), Herbert von Karajan, and Daniel Barenboim (the latter two both conducting the Berlin Philharmonic) have been widely praised. The Karajan recording was voted &quot;Record of the Year&quot; in the 1981 Gramophone Awards. Also highly regarded is a recording of &quot;Parsifal&quot; under the baton of Rafael Kubelík originally made for Deutsche Grammophon, now reissued on Arts &amp; Archives.

On the 14 December 2013 broadcast of BBC Radio 3&#x27;s CD Review – Building a Library, music critic David Nice surveyed recordings of &quot;Parsifal&quot; and recommended the recording by the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, Rafael Kubelik (conductor), as the best available choice.

===Filmed versions===
In addition to a number of staged performances available on DVD, &quot;Parsifal&quot; was adapted for the screen by Daniel Mangrané in 1951 and Hans-Jürgen Syberberg in 1982. There is also a 1998 documentary directed by Tony Palmer titled: &quot;Parsifal – The Search for the Grail&quot;. It was recorded in various European theaters, including the Mariinsky Theatre, the Ravello Festival in Siena, and the Bayreuth Festival. It contains extracts from Palmer&#x27;s stage production of &quot;Parsifal&quot; starring Plácido Domingo, Violeta Urmana, Matti Salminen, , and Anna Netrebko. In also includes interviews with Domingo, Wolfgang Wagner, writers Robert Gutman and Karen Armstrong. The film exists in two versions: (1) a complete version running 116 minutes and officially approved by Domingo, and (2) an 88-minute version, with cuts of passages regarded by the German distributor as being too &quot;political&quot;, &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, and &quot;irrelevant&quot;.

<text>A uniform is a variety of costume worn by members of an organization while usually participating in that organization&#x27;s activity. Modern uniforms are most often worn by armed forces and paramilitary organizations such as police, emergency services, security guards, in some workplaces and schools, and by inmates in prisons. In some countries, some other officials also wear uniforms in their duties; such is the case of the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service or the French prefects. For some organizations, such as police, it may be illegal for non-members to wear the uniform.

==Etymology==
From the Latin &quot;unus&quot; (meaning one), and &quot;forma&quot; (meaning form).

== Variants ==

=== Corporate and work uniforms ===

Workers sometimes wear uniforms or corporate clothing of one nature or another. Workers required to wear a uniform may include retail workers, bank and post-office workers, public-security and health-care workers, blue-collar employees, personal trainers in health clubs, instructors in summer camps, lifeguards, janitors, public-transit employees, towing- and truck-drivers, airline employees and holiday operators, and bar, restaurant and hotel employees. The use of uniforms in commercial or public-service organizations often reflects an effort in branding and in developing a standard corporate image; it also has important effects on the employees required to wear uniforms.

The term &quot;uniform&quot; may be misleading because employees are not always fully uniform in appearance and may not always wear attire provided by the organization, while still representing the organization in their attire. Academic work on organizational dress by Rafaeli &amp; Pratt (1993) referred to uniformity (homogeneity) of dress as one dimension, and conspicuousness as a second. Employees all wearing black, for example, may appear conspicuous and thus represent the organization even though their attire is uniform only in the color of their clothing, not in its features. Pratt &amp; Rafaeli, (1997) described struggles between employees and management about organizational dress as struggles about deeper meanings and identities that dress represents. And Pratt &amp; Rafaeli (2001) described dress as one of the larger set of symbols and artifacts in organizations, which coalesce into a communication grammar.

=== Armed forces and security ===
Military uniform is the standardised costume worn by members of the armed forces and paramilitaries of various nations. Military dress and military styles have gone through great changes over the centuries from colourful and elaborate to utilitarian camouflage uniforms for field and battle purposes. Military uniforms in the form of standardised and distinctive dress, intended for identification and display, are typically a sign of organised military forces equipped by a central authority. Most military forces have developed several different uniform types.

Military personnel in most armed forces and some civilian officials may wear some or all of the following: combat uniform, service dress, dress uniform, full dress uniform, mess dress.

=== Medical workers ===
Uniforms can distinguish various categories of staff in medical institutions: doctors, surgeons, nurses, ancillary staff and volunteers.

Traditional female nurses&#x27; uniforms resemble uniforms (habits) worn by religious orders.

Equipment - notably stethoscopes - worn like a badge of office, may accompany or replace medical uniforms.

=== Educational ===
Uniforms are required for students in many schools in different countries. School uniforms vary from a standard issue T-shirt to rigorous requirements for many items of formal wear at private schools. School uniforms are in place in many public schools as well.

Countries where mandatory school uniforms are common include Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand, India, Australia, UAE, Singapore, Albania, Philippines, some schools in Taiwan, New Zealand, South Africa, Indonesia and the United Kingdom, among many other places. In some countries, uniform types vary from school to school, in the United Kingdom, many pupils between 11 and 16 of age wear a blazer, tie and trousers for boys and blouse, tie and trousers, skirt, or culottes for girls. The ties tend to have a set pattern or a logo embroidered representing the school, and jackets will usually carry a badge on the breast pocket with the school&#x27;s name, coat of arms, and motto or emblem. Children in many British state primary schools will have a uniform jumper and/or polo shirt with the school name and logo.

Some universities in the DPRK require students to wear uniforms.

=== Diplomats ===

From about 1800 to after the Second World War, diplomats from most countries (and often senior non-military officials generally) wore official uniforms at public occasions. Such uniforms are now retained by only a few diplomatic services, and are seldom worn.

=== Police ===
Members of the police in every country have a uniform for identification as law-enforcement personnel or agents. They are distinguished from the public by the uniform the police wear during overt policing activity. Usually each country has its own different police uniform.

Contrast plainclothes law enforcement and undercover operations.

=== Sports ===

Most, if not all, sports teams also wear uniforms, made in the team&#x27;s distinctive colors. In individual sports like tennis and golf, players may choose any clothing design allowed by the competition rules.

To prevent the confusion (for officials, players, and fans) that might result from two opposing teams wearing uniforms (kits) with similar colors, teams have different variations for &quot;home&quot; and &quot;away&quot; games, where typically one is dark and the other is light. In the four major North American sports leagues, one of the two uniforms is almost always predominantly white, and each league except for the National Basketball Association (NBA) has a rule to determine which team should normally wear its white uniform. Customarily, National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League (NHL) teams wear their &quot;color&quot; uniforms for home games. By contrast, Major League Baseball (MLB) teams wear their &quot;white&quot; uniforms for home games. The NBA traditionally required home teams to wear white, or at least a light color, but as of the allows home teams to wear any uniform color, mandating only that away teams wear a color that sufficiently contrasts with the home team&#x27;s choice. These rules are not strictly enforced, however, for any of the four major professional sports leagues in North America. Some NFL teams, most notably the Dallas Cowboys, prefer to wear their white jerseys for home games. When Joe Gibbs was the head coach of the Washington Redskins — first from 1981 to 1992, and again from 2004 to 2007 — the Redskins exclusively wore white jerseys at home games. In the United Kingdom, especially in football, the terms &quot;kit&quot; or &quot;strip&quot; (as in &#x27;football kit&#x27;) are more common (instead of uniform).
=== Domestic workers ===
Domestic workers are often required by their employers-managers to wear a uniform.

=== Prison ===
A prison uniform is any uniform worn by individuals incarcerated in a prison, jail or similar facility of detention.

=== Beautician ===
The beauticians use uniforms to protect their skin from harmful chemicals and acid. These chemical resistant and water proof uniforms are not only safe to work in but also provide a professional, polished appearance throughout the day.

=== Scouting ===
The Scout uniform is a specific characteristic of the Scouting movement, in the words of Baden-Powell at the 1937 World Jamboree, &quot;it covers the differences of country and race and make all feel that they are members one with another of one World Brotherhood&quot;. The original uniform, which has created a familiar image in the public eye, consisted of a khaki button-up shirt, shorts and a broad-brimmed campaign hat. Baden-Powell himself wore shorts since being dressed like the youth contributed to reducing perceived &quot;distance&quot; between the adult and the young person. Nowadays, uniforms are frequently blue, orange, red, or green, and shorts are replaced by long pants in areas where the culture calls for modesty, and in winter weather. The campaign hats have also been dropped in some Scouting organisations.

==Buttons==
Some uniforms have specially-manufactured buttons, which, in the case of antiques, often outlast the fabric components of the uniform, and become highly collectable items. Nowadays, buttons come in different materials, shapes sizes and colors.

==Hygiene==
In some countries or regions such as the UK, Australia or Hong Kong, the cost of cleaning one&#x27;s uniform or work clothing can be partially deducted or rebated from the personal income tax, if the organization for which the person works does not have a laundry department or an outsourced commercial laundry.

<text>Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is &quot;acute&quot; if it resolves within six months, and &quot;chronic&quot; if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer.

Hepatitis is most commonly caused by the virus &quot;hepatovirus A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, and &quot;E&quot;. Other viruses can also cause liver inflammation, including cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and yellow fever virus. Other common causes of hepatitis include heavy alcohol use, certain medications, toxins, other infections, autoimmune diseases, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Hepatitis A and E are mainly spread by contaminated food and water. Hepatitis B is mainly sexually transmitted, but may also be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth and spread through infected blood. Hepatitis C is commonly spread through infected blood such as may occur during needle sharing by intravenous drug users. Hepatitis D can only infect people already infected with hepatitis B.

Hepatitis A, B, and D are preventable with immunization. Medications may be used to treat chronic viral hepatitis. Antiviral medications are recommended in all with chronic hepatitis C, except those with conditions that limit their life expectancy. There is no specific treatment for NASH; physical activity, a healthy diet, and weight loss are recommended. Autoimmune hepatitis may be treated with medications to suppress the immune system. A liver transplant may be an option in both acute and chronic liver failure.

Worldwide in 2015, hepatitis A occurred in about 114 million people, chronic hepatitis B affected about 343 million people and chronic hepatitis C about 142 million people. In the United States, NASH affects about 11 million people and alcoholic hepatitis affects about 5 million people. Hepatitis results in more than a million deaths a year, most of which occur indirectly from liver scarring or liver cancer. In the United States, hepatitis A is estimated to occur in about 2,500 people a year and results in about 75 deaths. The word is derived from the Greek &quot;hêpar&quot; (), meaning &quot;liver&quot;, and &quot;&quot; (), meaning &quot;inflammation&quot;.
== Signs and symptoms ==

Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure. The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting. Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.

=== Acute hepatitis ===
Acute viral hepatitis follows three distinct phases:
# The initial prodromal phase (preceding symptoms) involves non-specific and flu-like symptoms common to many acute viral infections. These include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, joint pain, and headaches. Fever, when present, is most common in cases of hepatitis A and E. Late in this phase, people can experience liver-specific symptoms, including choluria (dark urine) and clay-colored stools.
# Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes follow the prodrome after about 1–2 weeks and can last for up to 4 weeks. The non-specific symptoms seen in the prodromal typically resolve by this time, but people will develop an enlarged liver and right upper abdominal pain or discomfort. 10–20% of people will also experience an enlarged spleen, while some people will also experience a mild unintentional weight loss.
# The recovery phase is characterized by resolution of the clinical symptoms of hepatitis with persistent elevations in liver lab values and potentially a persistently enlarged liver. All cases of hepatitis A and E are expected to fully resolve after 1–2 months. Most hepatitis B cases are also self-limiting and will resolve in 3–4 months. Few cases of hepatitis C will resolve completely.

Occasionally, however, acute hepatitis can cause liver failure. Liver failure can be life threatening and may lead to a coma or even death.

Both drug-induced hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis can present very similarly to acute viral hepatitis, with slight variations in symptoms depending on the cause. Cases of drug-induced hepatitis can manifest with systemic signs of an allergic reaction including rash, fever, serositis (inflammation of membranes lining certain organs), elevated eosinophils (a type of white blood cell), and suppression of bone marrow activity.

=== Fulminant hepatitis ===
Fulminant hepatitis, or massive hepatic cell death, is a rare and life-threatening complication of acute hepatitis that can occur in cases of hepatitis B, D, and E, in addition to drug-induced and autoimmune hepatitis. The complication more frequently occurs in instances of hepatitis B and D co-infection at a rate of 2–20% and in pregnant women with hepatitis E at rate of 15–20% of cases. In addition to the signs of acute hepatitis, people can also demonstrate signs of coagulopathy (abnormal coagulation studies with easy bruising and bleeding) and encephalopathy (confusion, disorientation, and sleepiness). Mortality due to fulminant hepatitis is typically the result of various complications including cerebral edema, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, respiratory failure, or kidney failure.

=== Chronic hepatitis ===
Acute cases of hepatitis are seen to be resolved well within a six-month period. When hepatitis is continued for more than six months it is termed chronic hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis is often asymptomatic early in its course and is detected only by liver laboratory studies for screening purposes or to evaluate non-specific symptoms. As the inflammation progresses, patients can develop constitutional symptoms similar to acute hepatitis, including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, and joint pain. Jaundice can occur as well, but much later in the disease process and is typically a sign of advanced disease. Chronic hepatitis interferes with hormonal functions of the liver which can result in acne, hirsutism (abnormal hair growth), and amenorrhea (lack of menstrual period) in women. Extensive damage and scarring of the liver over time defines cirrhosis, a condition in which the liver&#x27;s ability to function is permanently impeded. This results in jaundice, weight loss, coagulopathy, ascites (abdominal fluid collection), and peripheral edema (leg swelling). Cirrhosis can lead to other life-threatening complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, hepatorenal syndrome, and liver cancer.

== Causes ==
Causes of hepatitis can be divided into the following major categories: infectious, metabolic, ischemic, autoimmune, genetic, and other. Infectious agents include viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Metabolic causes include prescription medications, toxins (most notably alcohol), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Autoimmune and genetic causes of hepatitis involve genetic predispositions and tend to affect characteristic populations.

=== Infectious ===

==== Viral hepatitis ====

Viral hepatitis is the most common type of hepatitis worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa. Viral hepatitis is caused by five different viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E). Hepatitis A and hepatitis E behave similarly: they are both transmitted by the fecal–oral route, are more common in developing countries, and are self-limiting illnesses that do not lead to chronic hepatitis.

Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis D are transmitted when blood or mucous membranes are exposed to infected blood and body fluids, such as semen and vaginal secretions. Viral particles have also been found in saliva and breastmilk. Kissing, sharing utensils, and breastfeeding do not lead to transmission unless these fluids are introduced into open sores or cuts. Many families who do not have safe drinking water or live in unhygienic homes have contracted hepatitis because saliva and blood droplets are often carried through the water and blood-borne illnesses spread quickly in unsanitary settings.

Hepatitis B and C can present either acutely or chronically. Hepatitis D is a defective virus that requires hepatitis B to replicate and is only found with hepatitis B co-infection. In adults, hepatitis B infection is most commonly self-limiting, with less than 5% progressing to chronic state, and 20 to 30% of those chronically infected developing cirrhosis or liver cancer. Infection in infants and children frequently leads to chronic infection.

Unlike hepatitis B, most cases of hepatitis C lead to chronic infection. Hepatitis C is the second most common cause of cirrhosis in the US (second to alcoholic hepatitis). In the 1970s and 1980s, blood transfusions were a major factor in spreading hepatitis C virus. Since widespread screening of blood products for hepatitis C began in 1992, the risk of acquiring hepatitis C from a blood transfusion has decreased from approximately 10% in the 1970s to 1 in 2 million currently.

==== Parasitic hepatitis ====

Parasites can also infect the liver and activate the immune response, resulting in symptoms of acute hepatitis with increased serum IgE (though chronic hepatitis is possible with chronic infections). Of the protozoans, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania species, and the malaria-causing Plasmodium species all can cause liver inflammation. Another protozoan, Entamoeba histolytica, causes hepatitis with distinct liver abscesses.

Of the worms, the cestode Echinococcus granulosus, also known as the dog tapeworm, infects the liver and forms characteristic hepatic hydatid cysts. The liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Clonorchis sinensis live in the bile ducts and cause progressive hepatitis and liver fibrosis.

==== Bacterial hepatitis ====
Bacterial infection of the liver commonly results in pyogenic liver abscesses, acute hepatitis, or granulomatous (or chronic) liver disease. Pyogenic abscesses commonly involve enteric bacteria such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; and are composed of multiple bacteria up to 50% of the time. Acute hepatitis is caused by &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;, &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, &quot;Bartonella henselae&quot;, &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot;, salmonella species, brucella species and campylobacter species. Chronic or granulomatous hepatitis is seen with infection from mycobacteria species, &quot;Tropheryma whipplei&quot;, &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot;, &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot;, and rickettsia species.

=== Metabolic ===

==== Alcoholic hepatitis ====

Excessive alcohol consumption is a significant cause of hepatitis and is the most common cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. Alcoholic hepatitis is within the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease. This ranges in order of severity and reversibility from alcoholic steatosis (least severe, most reversible), alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer (most severe, least reversible). Hepatitis usually develops over years-long exposure to alcohol, occurring in 10 to 20% of alcoholics. The most important risk factors for the development of alcoholic hepatitis are quantity and duration of alcohol intake. Long-term alcohol intake in excess of 80 grams of alcohol a day in men and 40 grams a day in women is associated with development of alcoholic hepatitis (1 beer or 4 ounces of wine is equivalent to 12g of alcohol). Alcoholic hepatitis can vary from asymptomatic hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) to symptoms of acute or chronic hepatitis to liver failure.

==== Toxic and drug-induced hepatitis ====
Many chemical agents, including medications, industrial toxins, and herbal and dietary supplements, can cause hepatitis. The spectrum of drug-induced liver injury varies from acute hepatitis to chronic hepatitis to acute liver failure. Toxins and medications can cause liver injury through a variety of mechanisms, including direct cell damage, disruption of cell metabolism, and causing structural changes. Some drugs such as paracetamol exhibit predictable dose-dependent liver damage while others such as isoniazid cause idiosyncratic and unpredictable reactions that vary by person. There are wide variations in the mechanisms of liver injury and latency period from exposure to development of clinical illness.

Many types of drugs can cause liver injury, including the analgesic paracetamol; antibiotics such as isoniazid, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; anticonvulsants such as valproate and phenytoin; cholesterol-lowering statins; steroids such as oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids; and highly active anti-retroviral therapy used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Of these, amoxicillin-clavulanate is the most common cause of drug-induced liver injury, and paracetamol toxicity the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States and Europe.

Herbal remedies and dietary supplements are another important cause of hepatitis; these are the most common causes of drug-induced hepatitis in Korea. The United States–based Drug Induced Liver Injury Network linked more than 16% of cases of hepatotoxicity to herbal and dietary supplements. In the United States, herbal and dietary supplements – unlike pharmaceutical drugs – are unregulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The National Institutes of Health maintains the LiverTox database for consumers to track all known prescription and non-prescription compounds associated with liver injury.

Exposure to other hepatotoxins can occur accidentally or intentionally through ingestion, inhalation, and skin absorption. The industrial toxin carbon tetrachloride and the wild mushroom Amanita phalloides are other known hepatotoxins.

==== Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ====
Non-alcoholic hepatitis is within the spectrum of non-alcoholic liver disease (NALD), which ranges in severity and reversibility from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to cirrhosis to liver cancer, similar to the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease.

Non-alcoholic liver disease occurs in people with little or no history of alcohol use, and is instead strongly associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. Over time, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which additionally involves liver cell death, liver inflammation and possible fibrosis. Factors accelerating progression from NAFLD to NASH are obesity, older age, non-African American ethnicity, female gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, higher ALT or AST level, higher AST/ALT ratio, low platelet count, and an ultrasound steatosis score.

In the early stages (as with NAFLD and early NASH), most patients are asymptomatic or have mild right upper quadrant pain, and diagnosis is suspected on the basis of abnormal liver function tests. As the disease progresses, symptoms typical of chronic hepatitis may develop. While imaging can show fatty liver, only liver biopsy can demonstrate inflammation and fibrosis characteristic of NASH. 9 to 25% of patients with NASH develop cirrhosis. NASH is recognized as the third most common cause of liver disease in the United States.

=== Autoimmune ===
Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disease caused by an abnormal immune response against liver cells. The disease is thought to have a genetic predisposition as it is associated with certain human leukocyte antigens involved in the immune response. As in other autoimmune diseases, circulating auto-antibodies may be present and are helpful in diagnosis. Auto-antibodies found in patients with autoimmune hepatitis include the sensitive but less specific anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA). Other autoantibodies that are less common but more specific to autoimmune hepatitis are the antibodies against liver kidney microsome 1 (LKM1) and soluble liver antigen (SLA). Autoimmune hepatitis can also be triggered by drugs (such as nitrofurantoin, hydralazine, and methyldopa), after liver transplant, or by viruses (such as hepatitis A, Epstein-Barr virus, or measles).

Autoimmune hepatitis can present anywhere within the spectrum from asymptomatic to acute or chronic hepatitis to fulminant liver failure. Patients are asymptomatic 25–34% of the time, and the diagnosis is suspected on the basis of abnormal liver function tests. Some studies show between 25% and 75% of cases present with signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis. As with other autoimmune diseases, autoimmune hepatitis usually affects young females (though it can affect patients of either sex of any age), and patients can exhibit classic signs and symptoms of autoimmunity such as fatigue, anemia, anorexia, amenorrhea, acne, arthritis, pleurisy, thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis, nephritis, and maculopapular rash. Autoimmune hepatitis increases the risk for cirrhosis, and the risk for liver cancer is increased by about 1% for each year of the disease.

Many people with autoimmune hepatitis have other autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune hepatitis is distinct from the other autoimmune diseases of the liver, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, both of which can also lead to scarring, fibrosis, and cirrhosis of the liver.

=== Genetic ===
Genetic causes of hepatitis include alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, and Wilson&#x27;s disease. In alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, a co-dominant mutation in the gene for alpha-1-antitrypsin results in the abnormal accumulation of the mutant AAT protein within liver cells, leading to liver disease. Hemochromatosis and Wilson&#x27;s disease are both autosomal recessive diseases involving abnormal storage of minerals. In hemochromatosis, excess amounts of iron accumulate in multiple body sites, including the liver, which can lead to cirrhosis. In Wilson&#x27;s disease, excess amounts of copper accumulate in the liver and brain, causing cirrhosis and dementia.

When the liver is involved, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and Wilson&#x27;s disease tend to present as hepatitis in the neonatal period or in childhood. Hemochromatosis typically presents in adulthood, with the onset of clinical disease usually after age 50.

=== Ischemic hepatitis ===

Ischemic hepatitis (also known as shock liver) results from reduced blood flow to the liver as in shock, heart failure, or vascular insufficiency. The condition is most often associated with heart failure but can also be caused by shock or sepsis. Blood testing of a person with ischemic hepatitis will show very high levels of transaminase enzymes (AST and ALT). The condition usually resolves if the underlying cause is treated successfully. Ischemic hepatitis rarely causes permanent liver damage.

=== Other ===

Hepatitis can also occur in neonates and is attributable to a variety of causes, some of which are not typically seen in adults. Congenital or perinatal infection with the hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and syphilis can cause neonatal hepatitis. Structural abnormalities such as biliary atresia and choledochal cysts can lead to cholestatic liver injury leading to neonatal hepatitis. Metabolic diseases such as glycogen storage disorders and lysosomal storage disorders are also implicated. Neonatal hepatitis can be idiopathic, and in such cases, biopsy often shows large multinucleated cells in the liver tissue. This disease is termed giant cell hepatitis and may be associated with viral infection, autoimmune disorders, and drug toxicity.

== Mechanism ==

The specific mechanism varies and depends on the underlying cause of the hepatitis. Generally, there is an initial insult that causes liver injury and activation of an inflammatory response, which can become chronic, leading to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis.

=== Viral hepatitis ===
The pathway by which hepatic viruses cause viral hepatitis is best understood in the case of hepatitis B and C. The viruses do not directly activate apoptosis (cell death). Rather, infection of liver cells activates the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system leading to an inflammatory response which causes cellular damage and death, including viral-induced apoptosis via the induction of the death receptor-mediated signaling pathway. Depending on the strength of the immune response, the types of immune cells involved and the ability of the virus to evade the body&#x27;s defense, infection can either lead to clearance (acute disease) or persistence (chronic disease) of the virus. The chronic presence of the virus within liver cells results in multiple waves of inflammation, injury and wound healing that over time lead to scarring or fibrosis and culminate in hepatocellular carcinoma. People with impaired immune response are at greater risk of developing chronic infection. Natural killer cells are the primary drivers of the initial innate response and create a cytokine environment that results in the recruitment of CD4 T-helper and CD8 cytotoxic T-cells. Type I interferons are the cytokines that drive the antiviral response. In chronic Hepatitis B and C, natural killer cell function is impaired.

=== Steatohepatitis ===

Steatohepatitis is seen in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease and is the culmination of a cascade of events that began with injury. In the case of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, this cascade is initiated by changes in metabolism associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation. In alcoholic hepatitis, chronic excess alcohol use is the culprit. Though the inciting event may differ, the progression of events is similar and begins with accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA) and their breakdown products in the liver cells in a process called steatosis. This initially reversible process overwhelms the hepatocyte&#x27;s ability to maintain lipid homeostasis leading to a toxic effect as fat molecules accumulate and are broken down in the setting of an oxidative stress response. Over time, this abnormal lipid deposition triggers the immune system via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF that cause liver cell injury and death. These events mark the transition to steatohepatitis and in the setting of chronic injury, fibrosis eventually develops setting up events that lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Microscopically, changes that can be seen include steatosis with large and swollen hepatocytes (ballooning), evidence of cellular injury and cell death (apoptosis, necrosis), evidence of inflammation in particular in zone 3 of the liver, variable degrees of fibrosis and Mallory bodies.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person&#x27;s signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy. In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person&#x27;s blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis. For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful. In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis. Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.

Blood testing includes liver enzymes, serology (i.e. for autoantibodies), nucleic acid testing (i.e. for hepatitis virus DNA/RNA), blood chemistry, and complete blood count. Characteristic patterns of liver enzyme abnormalities can point to certain causes or stages of hepatitis. Generally, AST and ALT are elevated in most cases of hepatitis regardless of whether the person shows any symptoms. The degree of elevation (i.e. levels in the hundreds vs. in the thousands), the predominance for AST vs. ALT elevation, and the ratio between AST and ALT are informative of the diagnosis.

Ultrasound, CT, and MRI can all identify steatosis (fatty changes) of the liver tissue and nodularity of the liver surface suggestive of cirrhosis. CT and especially MRI are able to provide a higher level of detail, allowing visualization and characterize such structures as vessels and tumors within the liver. Unlike steatosis and cirrhosis, no imaging test is able to detect liver inflammation (i.e. hepatitis) or fibrosis. Liver biopsy is the only definitive diagnostic test that is able to assess inflammation and fibrosis of the liver.

=== Viral hepatitis ===
Viral hepatitis is primarily diagnosed through blood tests for levels of viral antigens (such as the hepatitis B surface or core antigen), anti-viral antibodies (such as the anti-hepatitis B surface antibody or anti-hepatitis A antibody), or viral DNA/RNA. In early infection (i.e. within 1 week), IgM antibodies are found in the blood. In late infection and after recovery, IgG antibodies are present and remain in the body for up to years. Therefore, when a patient is positive for IgG antibody but negative for IgM antibody, he is considered immune from the virus via either prior infection and recovery or prior vaccination.

In the case of hepatitis B, blood tests exist for multiple virus antigens (which are different components of the virion particle) and antibodies. The combination of antigen and antibody positivity can provide information about the stage of infection (acute or chronic), the degree of viral replication, and the infectivity of the virus.

=== Alcoholic versus non-alcoholic ===
The most apparent distinguishing factor between alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a history of excessive alcohol use. Thus, in patients who have no or negligible alcohol use, the diagnosis is unlikely to be alcoholic hepatitis. In those who drink alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis especially if there is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic steatohepatitis AST&gt;ALT with ratio of AST:ALT&gt;2:1 while in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ALT&gt;AST with ratio of ALT:AST&gt;1.5:1.

Liver biopsies show identical findings in patients with ASH and NASH, specifically, the presence of polymorphonuclear infiltration, hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis in the form of ballooning degeneration, Mallory bodies, and fibrosis around veins and sinuses.

== Virus screening ==
The purpose of screening for viral hepatitis is to identify people infected with the disease as early as possible, even before symptoms and transaminase elevations may be present. This allows for early treatment, which can both prevent disease progression and decrease the likelihood of transmission to others.

=== Hepatitis A ===
Hepatitis A causes an acute illness that does not progress to chronic liver disease. Therefore, the role of screening is to assess immune status in people who are at high risk of contracting the virus, as well as in people with known liver disease for whom hepatitis A infection could lead to liver failure. People in these groups who are not already immune can receive the hepatitis A vaccine.

Those at high risk and in need of screening include:
* People in close contact (either living with or having sexual contact) with someone who has hepatitis A
* People traveling to an area with endemic hepatitis A
* People who do not have access to clean water
* People who use illicit drugs
* People with liver disease
* People with poor sanitary habits such as not washing hands after using the restroom or changing diapers

The presence of anti-hepatitis A IgG in the blood indicates past infection with the virus or prior vaccination.

=== Hepatitis B ===

The CDC, WHO, USPSTF, and ACOG recommend routine hepatitis B screening for certain high-risk populations. Specifically, these populations include people who are:
* Beginning immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy
* Blood, organ, or tissue donors
* Born in countries where the prevalence of hepatitis B is high (defined as ≥2% of the population), whether or not they have been vaccinated
* Born in the United States whose parents are from countries where the prevalence of hepatitis B is very high (defined as ≥8% of the population), and who were not vaccinated
* Found to have elevated liver enzymes without a known cause
* HIV positive
* In close contact with (i.e. live or have sex with) people known to have hepatitis B
* Incarcerated
* Intravenous drug users
* Men who have sex with men
* On hemodialysis
* Pregnant
Screening consists of a blood test that detects hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). If HBsAg is present, a second test – usually done on the same blood sample – that detects the antibody for the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBcAg) can differentiate between acute and chronic infection. People who are high-risk whose blood tests negative for HBsAg can receive the hepatitis B vaccine to prevent future infection.

=== Hepatitis C ===
The CDC, WHO, USPSTF, AASLD, and ACOG recommend screening people at high risk for hepatitis C infection. These populations include people who are:
* Adults in the United States born between 1945 and 1965
* Blood or organ donors.
* Born to HCV-positive mothers
* HIV-positive
* Incarcerated, or who have been in the past
* Intranasal illicit drug users
* Intravenous drug users (past or current)
* Men who have sex with men
* On long-term hemodialysis, or who have been in the past
* Pregnant, and engaging in high-risk behaviors
* Recipients of blood products or organs prior to 1992 in the United States
* Recipients of tattoos in an &quot;unregulated setting&quot;
* Sex workers
* Workers in a healthcare setting who have had a needlestick injury
For people in the groups above whose exposure is ongoing, screening should be periodic, though there is no set optimal screening interval. The AASLD recommends screening men who have sex with men who are HIV-positive annually. People born in the US between 1945 and 1965 should be screened once (unless they have other exposure risks).

Screening consists of a blood test that detects anti-hepatitis C virus antibody. If anti-hepatitis C virus antibody is present, a confirmatory test to detect HCV RNA indicates chronic disease.

=== Hepatitis D ===
The CDC, WHO, USPSTF, AASLD, and ACOG recommend screening people at high risk for hepatitis D infection. These populations include people who are:
* Blood or organ donors.
* Incarcerated, or who have been in the past
* Intranasal illicit drug users
* Intravenous drug users (past or current)
* Sex workers
* Workers in a healthcare setting who have had a needlestick injury

Hepatitis D is extremely rare. Symptoms include chronic diarrhea, anal and intestinal blisters, purple urine, and burnt popcorn scented breath.

Screening consists of a blood test that detects the anti-hepitits D virus antibbody. If anti-hepitits D virus antibody is present, a confirmatory test to detect HDV RNA DNA indicates chronic disease.

== Prevention ==

=== Vaccines ===
==== Hepatitis A ====

The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.

For children 12 months of age or older, the vaccination is given as a shot into the muscle in two doses 6–18 months apart and should be started before the age 24 months.  The dosing is slightly different for adults depending on the type of the vaccine.  If the vaccine is for hepatitis A only, two doses are given 6–18 months apart depending on the manufacturer.  If the vaccine is combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B, up to 4 doses may be required.

==== Hepatitis B ====
The CDC recommends the routine vaccination of all children under the age of 19 with the hepatitis B vaccine. They also recommend it for those who desire it or are at high risk.

Routine vaccination for hepatitis B starts with the first dose administered as  a shot into the muscle before the newborn is discharged from the hospital. An additional two doses should be administered before the child is 18 months.

For babies born to a mother with hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, the first dose is unique – in addition to the vaccine, the hepatitis immune globulin should also be administered, both within 12 hours of birth.  These newborns should also be regularly tested for infection for at least the first year of life.

There is also a combination formulation that includes both hepatitis A and B vaccines.

==== Other ====

There are currently no vaccines available in the United States for hepatitis C or E. In 2015, a group in China published an article regarding the development of a vaccine for hepatitis E. As of March 2016, the United States government was in the process of recruiting participants for the phase IV trial of the hepatitis E vaccine.

=== Behavioral changes ===

==== Hepatitis A ====
Because hepatitis A is transmitted primarily through the oral-fecal route, the mainstay of prevention aside from vaccination is good hygiene, access to clean water and proper handling of sewage.

==== Hepatitis B and C ====
As hepatitis B and C are transmitted through blood and multiple bodily fluids, prevention is aimed at screening blood prior to transfusion, abstaining from the use of injection drugs, safe needle and sharps practices in healthcare settings, and safe sex practices.

====Hepatitis D====

The hepatitis D virus requires that a person first be infected with hepatitis B virus, so prevention efforts should focus on limiting the spread of hepatitis B. In people who have chronic hepatitis B infection and are at risk for superinfection with the hepatitis D virus, the preventive strategies are the same as for hepatitis B.

====Hepatitis E====

Hepatitis E is spread primarily through the oral-fecal route but may also be spread by blood and from mother to fetus. The mainstay of hepatitis E prevention is similar to that for hepatitis A (namely, good hygiene and clean water practices).

====Alcoholic and metabolic hepatitis====

As excessive alcohol consumption can lead to hepatitis and cirrhosis, the following are maximal recommendations for alcohol consumption:
* Men – ≤ 4 drinks on any given day and ≤ 14 drinks per week
* Women – ≤ 3 drinks on any given day and ≤ 7 drinks per week
To prevent MAFLD it is recommended to maintain a normal weight, eat a healthy diet, avoid added sugar, and exercise regularly.

=== Successes ===

====Hepatitis A====

In the United States, universal immunization has led to a two-thirds decrease in hospital admissions and medical expenses due to hepatitis A.

====Hepatitis B====

In the United States new cases of hepatitis B decreased 75% from 1990 to 2004.  The group that saw the greatest decrease was children and adolescents, likely reflecting the implementation of the 1999 guidelines.

====Hepatitis C====

Hepatitis C infections each year had been declining since the 1980s, but began to increase again in 2006. The data are unclear as to whether the decline can be attributed to needle exchange programmes.

====Alcoholic hepatitis====
Because people with alcoholic hepatitis may have no symptoms, it can be difficult to diagnose and the number of people with the disease is probably higher than many estimates. Programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous have been successful in decreasing death due to cirrhosis, but it is difficult to evaluate their success in decreasing the incidence of alcoholic hepatitis.

== Treatment ==
The treatment of hepatitis varies according to the type, whether it is acute or chronic, and the severity of the disease.
* Activity: Many people with hepatitis prefer bed rest, though it is not necessary to avoid all physical activity while recovering.
* Diet: A high-calorie diet is recommended. Many people develop nausea and cannot tolerate food later in the day, so the bulk of intake may be concentrated in the earlier part of the day. In the acute phase of the disease, intravenous feeding may be needed if patients cannot tolerate food and have poor oral intake subsequent to nausea and vomiting.
* Drugs: People with hepatitis should avoid taking drugs metabolized by the liver. Glucocorticoids are not recommended as a treatment option for acute viral hepatitis and may even cause harm, such as development of chronic hepatitis.
* Precautions: Universal precautions should be observed. Isolation is usually not needed, except in cases of hepatitis A and E who have fecal incontinence, and in cases of hepatitis B and C who have uncontrolled bleeding.

=== Hepatitis A ===
Hepatitis A usually does not progress to a chronic state, and rarely requires hospitalization. Treatment is supportive and includes such measures as providing intravenous (IV) hydration and maintaining adequate nutrition.

Rarely, people with the hepatitis A virus can rapidly develop liver failure, termed &quot;fulminant hepatic failure&quot;, especially the elderly and those who had a pre-existing liver disease, especially hepatitis C. Mortality risk factors include greater age and chronic hepatitis C. In these cases, more aggressive supportive therapy and liver transplant may be necessary.

=== Hepatitis B ===
==== Acute ====
In healthy patients, 95–99% recover with no long-lasting effects, and antiviral treatment is not warranted. Age and comorbid conditions can result in a more prolonged and severe illness. Certain patients warrant hospitalization, especially those who present with clinical signs of ascites, peripheral edema, and hepatic encephalopathy, and laboratory signs of hypoglycemia, prolonged prothrombin time, low serum albumin, and very high serum bilirubin.

In these rare, more severe acute cases, patients have been successfully treated with antiviral therapy similar to that used in cases of chronic hepatitis B, with nucleoside analogues such as entecavir or tenofovir. As there is a dearth of clinical trial data and the drugs used to treat are prone to developing resistance, experts recommend reserving treatment for severe acute cases, not mild to moderate.

==== Chronic ====
Chronic hepatitis B management aims to control viral replication, which is correlated with progression of disease. Seven drugs are approved in the United States:
* Adefovir dipivoxil, a nucleotide analogue, has been used to supplement lamivudine in patients who develop resistance, but is no longer recommended as first-line therapy.
* Entecavir is safe, well tolerated, less prone to developing resistance, and the most potent of the existing hepatitis B antivirals; it is thus a first-line treatment choice. It is not recommended for lamivudine-resistant patients or as monotherapy in patients who are HIV positive.
* Injectable interferon alpha was the first therapy approved for chronic hepatitis B. It has several side effects, most of which are reversible with removal of therapy, but it has been supplanted by newer treatments for this indication. These include long-acting interferon bound to polyethylene glycol (pegylated interferon) and the oral nucleoside analogues.
* Lamivudine was the first approved oral nucleoside analogue. While effective and potent, lamivudine has been replaced by newer, more potent treatments in the Western world and is no longer recommended as first-line treatment. It is still used in areas where newer agents either have not been approved or are too costly. Generally, the course of treatment is a minimum of one year with a minimum of six additional months of &quot;consolidation therapy.&quot; Based on viral response, longer therapy may be required, and certain patients require indefinite long-term therapy. Due to a less robust response in Asian patients, consolidation therapy is recommended to be extended to at least a year. All patients should be monitored for viral reactivation, which if identified, requires restarting treatment. Lamivudine is generally safe and well tolerated. Many patients develop resistance, which is correlated with longer treatment duration. If this occurs, an additional antiviral is added. Lamivudine as a single treatment is contraindicated in patients coinfected with HIV, as resistance develops rapidly, but it can be used as part of a multidrug regimen.
* Pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) is dosed just once a week as a subcutaneous injection and is both more convenient and effective than standard interferon. Although it does not develop resistance as do many of the oral antivirals, it is poorly tolerated and requires close monitoring. PEG IFN is estimated to cost about $18,000 per year in the United States, compared to $2,500–8,700 for the oral medications. Its treatment duration is 48 weeks, unlike oral antivirals which require indefinite treatment for most patients (minimum one year). PEG IFN is not effective in patients with high levels of viral activity and cannot be used in immunosuppressed patients or those with cirrhosis.
* Telbivudine is effective but not recommended as first-line treatment; as compared to entecavir, it is both less potent and more resistance prone.
* Tenofovir is a nucleotide analogue and an antiretroviral drug that is also used to treat HIV infection. It is preferred to adefovir both in lamivudine-resistant patients and as initial treatment since it is both more potent and less likely to develop resistance.
First-line treatments currently used include PEG IFN, entecavir, and tenofovir, subject to patient and physician preference. Treatment initiation is guided by recommendations issued by The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and is based on detectable viral levels, HBeAg positive or negative status, ALT levels, and in certain cases, family history of HCC and liver biopsy. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, treatment is recommended regardless of HBeAg status or ALT level, but recommendations differ regarding HBV DNA levels; AASLD recommends treating at DNA levels detectable above 2x103 IU/mL; EASL and WHO recommend treating when HBV DNA levels are detectable at any level. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, treatment and evaluation for liver transplantation are recommended in all cases if HBV DNA is detectable. Currently, multidrug treatment is not recommended in treatment of chronic HBV as it is no more effective in the long term than individual treatment with entecavir or tenofovir.

=== Hepatitis C ===

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (AASLD-IDSA) recommend antiviral treatment for all patients with chronic hepatitis C infection except for those with additional chronic medical conditions that limit their life expectancy.

Once it is acquired, persistence of the hepatitis C virus is the rule, resulting in chronic hepatitis C. The goal of treatment is prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The best way to reduce the long-term risk of HCC is to achieve sustained virological response (SVR). SVR is defined as an undetectable viral load at 12 weeks after treatment completion and indicates a cure. Currently available treatments include indirect and direct acting antiviral drugs. The indirect acting antivirals include pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), which in combination have historically been the basis of therapy for HCV. Duration of and response to these treatments varies based on genotype. These agents are poorly tolerated but are still used in some resource-poor areas. In high-resource countries, they have been supplanted by direct acting antiviral agents, which first appeared in 2011; these agents target proteins responsible for viral replication and include the following three classes:
* NS3 and NS4A protease inhibitors, including telaprevir, boceprevir, simeprevir, and others
* NS5A inhibitors, including ledipasvir, daclatasvir, and others
* NS5B inhibitors, including sofosbuvir, dasabuvir, and others
These drugs are used in various combinations, sometimes combined with ribavirin, based on the patient&#x27;s genotype, delineated as genotypes 1–6. Genotype 1 (GT1), which is the most prevalent genotype in the United States and around the world, can now be cured with a direct acting antiviral regimen. First-line therapy for GT1 is a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) for 12 weeks for most patients, including those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Certain patients with early disease need only 8 weeks of treatment while those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who have not responded to prior treatment require 24 weeks. Cost remains a major factor limiting access to these drugs, particularly in low-resource nations; the cost of the 12-week GT1 regimen (SOF/LDV) has been estimated at US$94,500.

=== Hepatitis D ===

Hepatitis D is difficult to treat, and effective treatments are lacking. Interferon alpha has proven effective at inhibiting viral activity but only on a temporary basis.

=== Hepatitis E ===
Similar to hepatitis A, treatment of hepatitis E is supportive and includes rest and ensuring adequate nutrition and hydration. Hospitalization may be required for particularly severe cases or for pregnant women.

=== Alcoholic hepatitis ===
First-line treatment of alcoholic hepatitis is treatment of alcoholism. For those who abstain completely from alcohol (teetotal), reversal of liver disease and a longer life are possible; patients at every disease stage have been shown to benefit by prevention of additional liver injury. In addition to referral to psychotherapy and other treatment programs, treatment should include nutritional and psychosocial evaluation and treatment. Patients should also be treated appropriately for related signs and symptoms, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and infection.

Severe alcoholic hepatitis has a poor prognosis and is notoriously difficult to treat. Without any treatment, 20–50% of patients may die within a month, but evidence shows treatment may extend life beyond one month (i.e., reduce short-term mortality). Available treatment options include pentoxifylline (PTX), which is a nonspecific TNF inhibitor, corticosteroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone (CS), corticosteroids with &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine (CS with NAC), and corticosteroids with pentoxifylline (CS with PTX). Data suggest that CS alone or CS with NAC are most effective at reducing short-term mortality. Unfortunately, corticosteroids are contraindicated in some patients, such as those who have active gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, kidney failure, or pancreatitis. In these cases PTX may be considered on a case-by-case basis in lieu of CS; some evidence shows PTX is better than no treatment at all and may be comparable to CS while other data show no evidence of benefit over placebo. Unfortunately, there are currently no drug treatments that decrease these patients&#x27; risk of dying in the longer term, at 3–12 months and beyond.

Weak evidence suggests milk thistle extracts may improve survival in alcoholic liver disease and improve certain liver tests (serum bilirubin and GGT) without causing side effects, but a firm recommendation cannot be made for or against milk thistle without further study. 

The modified Maddrey&#x27;s discriminant function may be used to evaluate the severity and prognosis in alcoholic hepatitis and evaluates the efficacy of using alcoholic hepatitis corticosteroid treatment.

=== Metabolic hepatitis===

The main treatment of NASH is gradual weight loss and increased physical activity. In the United States, no medications have been approved to treat this disease.
=== Autoimmune hepatitis ===

Autoimmune hepatitis is commonly treated by immunosuppressants such as the corticosteroids prednisone or prednisolone, the active version of prednisolone that does not require liver synthesis, either alone or in combination with azathioprine, and some have suggested the combination therapy is preferred to allow for lower doses of corticosteroids to reduce associated side effects, although the result of treatment efficacy is comparative.

Treatment of autoimmune hepatitis consists of two phases; an initial and maintenance phase. The initial phase consists of higher doses of corticosteroids which are tapered down over a number of weeks to a lower dose. If used in combination, azathioprine is given during the initial phase as well. Once the initial phase has been completed, a maintenance phase that consists of lower dose corticosteroids, and in combination therapy, azathioprine until liver blood markers are normalized. Treatment results in 66–91% of patients achieving normal liver test values in two years, with the average being 22 months.

== Prognosis ==

=== Acute hepatitis ===
Nearly all patients with hepatitis A infections recover completely without complications if they were healthy prior to the infection. Similarly, acute hepatitis B infections have a favorable course towards complete recovery in 95–99% of patients. Certain factors may portend a poorer outcome, such as co-morbid medical conditions or initial presenting symptoms of ascites, edema, or encephalopathy. Overall, the mortality rate for acute hepatitis is low: ~0.1% in total for cases of hepatitis A and B, but rates can be higher in certain populations (super infection with both hepatitis B and D, pregnant women, etc.).

In contrast to hepatitis A &amp; B, hepatitis C carries a much higher risk of progressing to chronic hepatitis, approaching 85–90%. Cirrhosis has been reported to develop in 20–50% of patients with chronic hepatitis C.

Other rare complications of acute hepatitis include pancreatitis, aplastic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and myocarditis.

==== Fulminant hepatitis ====
Despite the relatively benign course of most viral cases of hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis represents a rare but feared complication. Fulminant hepatitis most commonly occurs in hepatitis B, D, and E. About 1–2% of cases of hepatitis E can lead to fulminant hepatitis, but pregnant women are particularly susceptible, occurring in up to 20% of cases. Mortality rates in cases of fulminant hepatitis rise over 80%, but those patients that do survive often make a complete recovery. Liver transplantation can be life-saving in patients with fulminant liver failure.

Hepatitis D infections can transform benign cases of hepatitis B into severe, progressive hepatitis, a phenomenon known as superinfection.

=== Chronic hepatitis ===
Acute hepatitis B infections become less likely to progress to chronic forms as the age of the patient increases, with rates of progression approaching 90% in vertically transmitted cases of infants compared to 1% risk in young adults. Overall, the five-year survival rate for chronic hepatitis B ranges from 97% in mild cases to 55% in severe cases with cirrhosis.

Most patients who acquire hepatitis D at the same time as hepatitis B (co-infection) recover without developing a chronic infection. In people with hepatitis B who later acquire hepatitis D (superinfection), chronic infection is much more common at 80–90%, and liver disease progression is accelerated.

Chronic hepatitis C progresses towards cirrhosis, with estimates of cirrhosis prevalence of 16% at 20 years after infection. While the major causes of mortality in hepatitis C is end stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma is an important additional long term complication and cause of death in chronic hepatitis.

Rates of mortality increase with progression of the underlying liver disease. Series of patients with compensated cirrhosis due to HCV have shown 3,5, and 10-year survival rates of 96, 91, and 79% respectively. The 5-year survival rate drops to 50% upon if the cirrhosis becomes decompensated.

== Epidemiology ==

=== Viral hepatitis ===

==== Hepatitis A ====
Hepatitis A is found throughout the world and manifests as large outbreaks and epidemics associated with fecal contamination of water and food sources. Hepatitis A viral infection is predominant in children ages 5–14 with rare infection of infants. Infected children have little to no apparent clinical illness, in contrast to adults in whom greater than 80% are symptomatic if infected. Infection rates are highest in low resource countries with inadequate public sanitation and large concentrated populations. In such regions, as much as 90% of children younger than 10 years old have been infected and are immune, corresponding both to lower rates of clinically symptomatic disease and outbreaks. The availability of a childhood vaccine has significantly reduced infections in the United States, with incidence declining by more than 95% as of 2013. Paradoxically, the highest rates of new infection now occur in young adults and adults who present with worse clinical illness. Specific populations at greatest risk include: travelers to endemic regions, men who have sex with men, those with occupational exposure to non-human primates, people with clotting disorders who have received clotting factors, people with history of chronic liver disease in whom co-infection with hepatitis A can lead to fulminant hepatitis, and intravenous drug users (rare).

==== Hepatitis B ====
Hepatitis B is the most common cause of viral hepatitis in the world with more than 240 million chronic carriers of the virus, 1 million of whom are in the United States. In approximately two-thirds of patients who develop acute hepatitis B infection, no identifiable exposure is evident. Of those acutely infected, 25% become lifetime carriers of the virus. Risk of infection is highest among intravenous drug users, people with high-risk sexual behaviors, healthcare workers, people who had multiple transfusions, organ transplant patients, dialysis patients and newborns infected during the birthing process. Close to 780,000 deaths in the world are attributed to hepatitis B. The most endemic regions are in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, where as many as 10% of adults are chronic carriers. Carrier rates in developed nations are significantly lower, encompassing less than 1% of the population. In endemic regions, transmission is thought to be associated with exposure during birth and close contact between young infants.

==== Hepatitis C ====
Chronic hepatitis C is a major cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is a common medical reason for liver transplantation due to its severe complications. It is estimated that 130–180 million people in the world are affected by this disease representing a little more than 3% of the world population. In the developing regions of Africa, Asia and South America, prevalence can be as high as 10% of the population. In Egypt, rates of hepatitis C infection as high as 20% have been documented and are associated with iatrogenic contamination related to schistosomiasis treatment in the 1950s–1980s. Currently in the United States, approximately 3.5 million adults are estimated to be infected. Hepatitis C is particularly prevalent among people born between 1945 and 1965, a group of about 800,000 people, with prevalence as high as 3.2% versus 1.6% in the general U.S. population. Most chronic carriers of hepatitis C are unaware of their infection status. The most common mode of transmission of hepatitis C virus is exposure to blood products via blood transfusions (prior to 1992) and intravenous drug injection. A history of intravenous drug injection is the most important risk factor for chronic hepatitis C. Other susceptible populations include those engaged in high-risk sexual behavior, infants of infected mothers, and healthcare workers.

==== Hepatitis D ====

The hepatitis D virus causes chronic and fulminant hepatitis in the context of co-infection with the hepatitis B virus. It is primarily transmitted via non-sexual contact and via needles. Susceptibility to hepatitis D differs by geographic region. In the United States and Northern Europe, populations at risk are intravenous drug users and people who receive multiple transfusions. In the Mediterranean, hepatitis D is predominant among hepatitis B virus co-infected people.

==== Hepatitis E ====

Similar to Hepatitis A, hepatitis E manifests as large outbreaks and epidemics associated with fecal contamination of water sources. It accounts for more than 55,000 deaths annually with approximately 20 million people worldwide thought to be infected with the virus. It affects predominantly young adults, causing acute hepatitis. In infected pregnant women, Hepatitis E infection can lead to fulminant hepatitis with third trimester mortality rates as high as 30%. Those with weakened immune systems, such as organ transplant recipients, are also susceptible. Infection is rare in the United States but rates are high in the developing world (Africa, Asia, Central America, Middle East). Many genotypes exist and are differentially distributed around the world. There is some evidence of hepatitis E infection of animals, serving as a reservoir for human infection.

=== Alcoholic hepatitis ===
Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) in its severe form has a one-month mortality as high as 50%. Most people who develop AH are men but women are at higher risk of developing AH and its complications likely secondary to high body fat and differences in alcohol metabolism. Other contributing factors include younger age &lt;60, binge pattern drinking, poor nutritional status, obesity and hepatitis C co-infection. It is estimated that as much as 20% of people with AH are also infected with hepatitis C. In this population, the presence of hepatitis C virus leads to more severe disease with faster progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and increased mortality. Obesity increases the likelihood of progression to cirrhosis in cases of alcoholic hepatitis. It is estimated that 70% of people who have AH will progress to cirrhosis.

=== Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ===
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is projected to become the top reason for liver transplantation in the United States by 2020, supplanting chronic liver disease due to hepatitis C. About 20–45% of the U.S. population have NAFLD and 6% have NASH. The estimated prevalence of NASH in the world is 3–5%. Of NASH patients who develop cirrhosis, about 2% per year will likely progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. Worldwide, the estimated prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma related to NAFLD is 15–30%. NASH is thought to be the primary cause of cirrhosis in approximately 25% of patients in the United States, representing 1–2% of the general population.

== History ==
=== Early observations ===
Initial accounts of a syndrome that we now think is likely to be hepatitis begin to occur around 3000 B.C. Clay tablets that served as medical handbooks for the ancient Sumerians described the first observations of jaundice. The Sumerians believed that the liver was the home of the soul, and attributed the findings of jaundice to the attack of the liver by a devil named Ahhazu.

Around 400 B.C., Hippocrates recorded the first documentation of an epidemic jaundice, in particular noting the uniquely fulminant course of a cohort of patients who all died within two weeks. He wrote, &quot;The bile contained in the liver is full of phlegm and blood, and erupts...After such an eruption, the patient soon raves, becomes angry, talks nonsense and barks like a dog.&quot;

Given the poor sanitary conditions of war, infectious jaundice played a large role as a major cause of mortality among troops in the Napoleonic Wars, the American Revolutionary War, and both World Wars. During World War II, estimates of soldiers affected by hepatitis were upwards of 10 million.

During World War II, soldiers received vaccines against diseases such as yellow fever, but these vaccines were stabilized with human serum, presumably contaminated with hepatitis viruses, which often created epidemics of hepatitis. It was suspected these epidemics were due to a separate infectious agent, and not due to the yellow fever virus itself, after noting 89 cases of jaundice in the months after vaccination out of a total 3,100 patients that were vaccinated. After changing the seed virus strain, no cases of jaundice were observed in the subsequent 8,000 vaccinations.

=== Willowbrook State School experiments ===
A New York University researcher named Saul Krugman continued this research into the 1950s and 1960s, most infamously with his experiments on mentally disabled children at the Willowbrook State School in New York, a crowded urban facility where hepatitis infections were highly endemic to the student body. Krugman injected students with gamma globulin, a type of antibody. After observing the temporary protection against infection this antibody provided, he then tried injected live hepatitis virus into students. Krugman also controversially took feces from infected students, blended it into milkshakes, and fed it to newly admitted children.

His research was received with much controversy, as people protested the questionable ethics surrounding the chosen target population. Henry Beecher was one of the foremost critics in an article in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; in 1966, arguing that parents were unaware to the risks of consent and that the research was done to benefit others at the expense of children. Moreover, he argued that poor families with mentally disabled children often felt pressured to join the research project to gain admission to the school, with all of the educational and support resources that would come along with it. Others in the medical community spoke out in support of Krugman&#x27;s research in terms of its widespread benefits and understanding of the hepatitis virus, and Willowbrook continues to be a commonly cited example in debates about medical ethics.

=== Australia antigen ===
The next insight regarding hepatitis B was a serendipitous one by Dr. Baruch Blumberg, a researcher at the NIH who did not set out to research hepatitis, but rather studied lipoprotein genetics. He travelled across the globe collecting blood samples, investigating the interplay between disease, environment, and genetics with the goal of designing targeted interventions for at-risk people that could prevent them from getting sick. He noticed an unexpected interaction between the blood of a patient with hemophilia that had received multiple transfusions and a protein found in the blood of an indigenous Australian person. He named the protein the &quot;Australia antigen&quot; and made it the focus of his research. He found a higher prevalence of the protein in the blood of patients from developing countries, compared to those from developed ones, and noted associations of the antigen with other diseases like leukemia and Down Syndrome. Eventually, he came to the unifying conclusion that the Australia antigen was associated with viral hepatitis.

In 1970, David Dane first isolated the hepatitis B virion at London&#x27;s Middlesex Hospital, and named the virion the 42-nm &quot;Dane particle&quot;. Based on its association with the surface of the hepatitis B virus, the Australia antigen was renamed to &quot;hepatitis B surface antigen&quot; or HBsAg.

Blumberg continued to study the antigen, and eventually developed the first hepatitis B vaccine using plasma rich in HBsAg, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1976.

== Society and culture ==

=== Economic burden ===
Overall, hepatitis accounts for a significant portion of healthcare expenditures in both developing and developed nations, and is expected to rise in several developing countries. While hepatitis A infections are self-limited events, they are associated with significant costs in the United States. It has been estimated that direct and indirect costs are approximately $1817 and $2459 respectively per case, and that an average of 27 work days is lost per infected adult. A 1997 report demonstrated that a single hospitalization related to hepatitis A cost an average of $6,900 and resulted in around $500 million in total annual healthcare costs. Cost effectiveness studies have found widespread vaccination of adults to not be feasible, but have stated that a combination hepatitis A and B vaccination of children and at risk groups (people from endemic areas, healthcare workers) may be.

Hepatitis B accounts for a much larger percentage of health care spending in endemic regions like Asia. In 1997 it accounted for 3.2% of South Korea&#x27;s total health care expenditures and resulted in $696 million in direct costs. A large majority of that sum was spent on treating disease symptoms and complications. Chronic hepatitis B infections are not as endemic in the United States, but accounted for $357 million in hospitalization costs in the year 1990. That number grew to $1.5 billion in 2003, but remained stable as of 2006, which may be attributable to the introduction of effective drug therapies and vaccination campaigns.

People infected with chronic hepatitis C tend to be frequent users of the health care system globally. It has been estimated that a person infected with hepatitis C in the United States will result in a monthly cost of $691. That number nearly doubles to $1,227 for people with compensated (stable) cirrhosis, while the monthly cost of people with decompensated (worsening) cirrhosis is almost five times as large at $3,682. The wide-ranging effects of hepatitis make it difficult to estimate indirect costs, but studies have speculated that the total cost is $6.5 billion annually in the United States. In Canada, 56% of HCV related costs are attributable to cirrhosis and total expenditures related to the virus are expected to peak at CAD$396 million in the year 2032.

=== 2003 Monaca outbreak ===
The largest outbreak of hepatitis A virus in United States history occurred among people who ate at a now-defunct Mexican food restaurant located in Monaca, Pennsylvania in late 2003. Over 550 people who visited the restaurant between September and October 2003 were infected with the virus, three of whom died as a direct result. The outbreak was brought to the attention of health officials when local emergency medicine physicians noticed a significant increase in cases of hepatitis A in the county. After conducting its investigation, the CDC attributed the source of the outbreak to the use of contaminated raw green onion. The restaurant was purchasing its green onion stock from farms in Mexico at the time. It is believed that the green onions may have been contaminated through the use of contaminated water for crop irrigation, rinsing, or icing or by handling of the vegetables by infected people. Green onion had caused similar outbreaks of hepatitis A in the southern United States prior to this, but not to the same magnitude. The CDC believes that the restaurant&#x27;s use of a large communal bucket for chopped raw green onion allowed non-contaminated plants to be mixed with contaminated ones, increasing the number of vectors of infection and amplifying the outbreak. The restaurant was closed once it was discovered to be the source, and over 9,000 people were given hepatitis A immune globulin because they had either eaten at the restaurant or had been in close contact with someone who had.

== Special populations ==

=== HIV co-infection ===
Persons infected with HIV have a particularly high burden of HIV-HCV co-infection. In a recent study by the WHO, the likelihood of being infected with hepatitis C virus was six times greater in those who also had HIV. The prevalence of HIV-HCV co-infection worldwide was estimated to be 6.2% representing more than 2.2 million people. Intravenous drug use was an independent risk factor for HCV infection. In the WHO study, the prevalence of HIV-HCV co-infection was markedly higher at 82.4% in those who injected drugs compared to the general population (2.4%). In a study of HIV-HCV co-infection among HIV positive men who have sex with men (MSM), the overall prevalence of anti-hepatitis C antibodies was estimated to be 8.1% and increased to 40% among HIV positive MSM who also injected drugs.

=== Pregnancy ===

==== Hepatitis B ====
Vertical transmission is a significant contributor of new HBV cases each year, with 35–50% of transmission from mother to neonate in endemic countries. Vertical transmission occurs largely via a neonate&#x27;s exposure to maternal blood and vaginal secretions during birth. While the risk of progression to chronic infection is approximately 5% among adults who contract the virus, it is as high as 95% among neonates subject to vertical transmission. The risk of viral transmission is approximately 10–20% when maternal blood is positive for HBsAg, and up to 90% when also positive for HBeAg.

Given the high risk of perinatal transmission, the CDC recommends screening all pregnant women for HBV at their first prenatal visit. It is safe for non-immune pregnant women to receive the HBV vaccine. Based on the limited available evidence, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends antiviral therapy in pregnant women whose viral load exceeds 200,000 IU/mL. A growing body of evidence shows that antiviral therapy initiated in the third trimester significantly reduces transmission to the neonate. A systematic review of the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry database found that there was no increased risk of congenital anomalies with Tenofovir; for this reason, along with its potency and low risk of resistance, the AASLD recommends this drug. A 2010 systematic review and meta-analysis found that Lamivudine initiated early in the third trimester also significantly reduced mother-to-child transmission of HBV, without any known adverse effects.

The ACOG states that the evidence available does not suggest any particular mode of delivery (i.e. vaginal vs. cesarean) is better at reducing vertical transmission in mothers with HBV.

The WHO and CDC recommend that neonates born to mothers with HBV should receive hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) as well as the HBV vaccine within 12 hours of birth. For infants who have received HBIG and the HBV vaccine, breastfeeding is safe.

==== Hepatitis C ====
Estimates of the rate of HCV vertical transmission range from 2–8%; a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found the risk to be 5.8% in HCV-positive, HIV-negative women. The same study found the risk of vertical transmission to be 10.8% in HCV-positive, HIV-positive women. Other studies have found the risk of vertical transmission to be as high as 44% among HIV-positive women. The risk of vertical transmission is higher when the virus is detectable in the mother&#x27;s blood.

Evidence does not indicate that mode of delivery (i.e. vaginal vs. cesarean) has an effect on vertical transmission.

For women who are HCV-positive and HIV-negative, breastfeeding is safe. CDC guidelines suggest avoiding it if a woman&#x27;s nipples are cracked or bleeding to reduce the risk of transmission.

==== Hepatitis E ====
Pregnant women who contract HEV are at significant risk of developing fulminant hepatitis with maternal mortality rates as high as 20–30%, most commonly in the third trimester . A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of 47 studies that included 3968 people found maternal case-fatality rates (CFR) of 20.8% and fetal CFR of 34.2%; among women who developed fulminant hepatic failure, CFR was 61.2%.

== Vaccine ==
An essential defense against hepatitis infections, especially those caused by Hepatitis A and B, is the hepatitis vaccination. The Hepatitis B vaccination is quite effective and frequently used. The frequency of hepatitis-related liver illnesses and fatalities has been considerably decreased by the immunization campaigns.

<text>Hugh John Lofting (14 January 1886 – 26 September 1947) was an English-American writer, trained as a civil engineer, who created the classic children&#x27;s literature character Doctor Dolittle. The fictional physician to talking animals, based in an English village, first appeared in illustrated letters to his children which Lofting sent from British Army trenches in the First World War. Lofting settled in the United States soon after the war and before his first book was published.

==Personal life==
Lofting was born on 14 January 1886 in Maidenhead, Berkshire, to Elizabeth Agnes (Gannon) and John Brien Lofting, was of English and Irish ancestry. His eldest brother, Hilary Lofting, later became a novelist in Australia, having emigrated there in 1915.

Lofting was educated at Mount St Mary&#x27;s College in Spinkhill, Derbyshire. From 1905 to 1906, he studied civil engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Lofting travelled widely as a civil engineer before enlisting in the Irish Guards regiment of the British Army in the First World War. Not wishing to write to his children about the brutal war, he wrote imaginative letters, which later became the foundation of the successful &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; novels for children. Seriously wounded in the war, he emigrated with his family to Killingworth, Connecticut, in 1919. He was married three times and had three children, one of whom, his son Christopher, became the executor of his literary estate.

Lofting died on 26 September 1947, at his home in Topanga, California from cirrhosis of the liver. He is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Killingworth, Middlesex County, Connecticut.

==Doctor Dolittle==

Hugh Lofting&#x27;s character, Doctor John Dolittle, an English physician from &quot;Puddleby-on-the-Marsh&quot; in the West Country, who could speak to animals, first saw light in illustrated letters written to his children from the trenches, when actual news, he later said, was too horrible or too dull. The stories are set in early Victorian England in the 1820s–1840s – &quot;The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle&quot; gives a date of 1839.

&quot;The Story of Doctor Dolittle: Being the History of His Peculiar Life at Home and Astonishing Adventures in Foreign Parts Never Before Printed&quot; (1920) began the series and won a posthumous Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958. Its first sequel, &quot;The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1922) won a Newbery Medal. Eight novels completed by Lofting followed and two more books were edited after his death.

==Other works for children==

&quot;The Story of Mrs Tubbs&quot; (1923) and &quot;Tommy, Tilly, and Mrs. Tubbs&quot; (1936) are picture books aimed at a younger audience than the Doctor Dolittle books. They tell of the old woman and her pets, with whom she can speak, and the animals who help her out of trouble.

&quot;Porridge Poetry&quot; (1924) is the only non-Dolittle work by Lofting still in print. It is a lighthearted, colourfully illustrated book of poems for children. &quot;Noisy Nora&quot; (1929) is a cautionary tale about a girl who is a noisy eater. The book is printed as if hand-written, and the many illustrations often merge with the text.

&quot;The Twilight of Magic&quot; (1930) is aimed at older readers. It is set in an age when magic is dying and science beginning. This work is the only one of Lofting&#x27;s books to be illustrated by another person: Lois Lenski.

==&quot;Victory for the Slain&quot;==

&quot;Victory for the Slain&quot; (1942), Lofting&#x27;s only work for adults, consists of a single long poem in seven parts about the futility of war, permeated by the refrain &quot;In war the only victors are the slain&quot;. It appeared only in the United Kingdom.

== Published books ==
Lofting commented: &quot;For years it was a constant source of shock to me to find my writings amongst &#x27;juveniles&#x27;. It does not bother me any more now, but I still feel there should be a category of &#x27;seniles&#x27; to offset the epithet&quot;.

<doc id="38241" wikidata="Q1324254" url="?curid=38241" title="Tristan und Isolde">
<text>Tristan und Isolde (&quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;), WWV 90, is a music drama in three acts by Richard Wagner set to a German libretto by the composer, loosely based on the medieval 12th-century romance &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot; by Gottfried von Strassburg. First conceived in 1854, the music was composed between 1857 and 1859 and premiered at the Königliches Hoftheater und Nationaltheater in Munich on 10 June 1865 with Hans von Bülow conducting. While performed by opera companies, Wagner preferred the term &quot;Handlung&quot; (German for &quot;plot&quot; or &quot;action&quot;) for &quot;Tristan&quot; to distinguish its structure of continuous narrative flow (&quot;endless melody&quot;) as distinct from that of conventional opera at the time which was constructed of mundane recitatives punctuated by showpiece arias, which Wagner had come to regard with great disdain.

Wagner&#x27;s composition of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; was inspired in part by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, as well as by his relationship with his muse Mathilde Wesendonck. The opera, which explores existential themes such as that of mankind&#x27;s insatiable striving and the transcendental nature of a love beyond death, incorporates spirituality from Christian mysticism as well as Vedantic and Buddhist metaphysics, subjects that also interested Schopenhauer. As such, Wagner was one of the earliest Western artists to introduce concepts from the Dharmic religions into their works.

&quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest achievements of Western art music, intriguing audiences with philosophical depths not usually associated with opera, and the &quot;terrible and sweet infinity&quot; of its musical-poetic language. Its advanced harmony, immediately announced by the famous opening &quot;Tristan chord&quot; of its prelude, marks a defining moment in the evolution of modern music, characterized by unprecedented use of chromaticism, tonal ambiguity, orchestral colour, and prolonged harmonic suspension. While these innovations divided audiences initially, the opera grew in popularity and became enormously influential among Western classical composers, providing direct inspiration to Anton Bruckner, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, and Benjamin Britten. Other composers such as Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Igor Stravinsky formulated their styles in contrast to Wagner&#x27;s musical legacy.

==Composition history==

Wagner was forced to abandon his position as conductor of the Dresden Opera in 1849, as there was a warrant posted for his arrest for his participation in the unsuccessful May Revolution. He left his wife, Minna, in Dresden, and fled to Zürich. There, in 1852, he met the wealthy silk trader Otto Wesendonck. Wesendonck became a supporter of Wagner and bankrolled the composer for several years. Wesendonck&#x27;s wife, Mathilde, became enamoured of the composer. Though Wagner was working on his epic &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, he found himself intrigued by the legend of Tristan and Isolde.

The re-discovery of medieval Germanic poetry, including Gottfried von Strassburg&#x27;s version of , the and Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot;, left a large impact on the German Romantic movements during the mid-19th century. The story of Tristan and Isolde is a quintessential romance of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Several versions of the story exist, the earliest dating to the middle of the 12th century. Gottfried&#x27;s version, part of the &quot;courtly&quot; branch of the legend, had a huge influence on later German literature.

According to his autobiography, &quot;Mein Leben&quot;, Wagner decided to dramatise the Tristan legend after his friend, Karl Ritter, attempted to do so, writing that:

He had, in fact, made a point of giving prominence to the lighter phases of the romance, whereas it was its all-pervading tragedy that impressed me so deeply that I felt convinced it should stand out in bold relief, regardless of minor details.

This influence, together with his discovery of the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer in October 1854, led Wagner to find himself in a &quot;serious mood created by Schopenhauer, which was trying to find ecstatic expression. It was some such mood that inspired the conception of a &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;.&quot;

Wagner wrote of his preoccupations with Schopenhauer and &quot;Tristan&quot; in a letter to Franz Liszt (16 December 1854): Never in my life having enjoyed the true happiness of love I shall erect a memorial to this loveliest of all dreams in which, from the first to the last, love shall, for once, find utter repletion. I have devised in my mind a &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, the simplest, yet most full-blooded musical conception imaginable, and with the &#x27;black flag&#x27; that waves at the end I shall cover myself over – to die.
By the end of 1854, Wagner had sketched out all three acts of an opera on the Tristan theme, based on Gottfried von Strassburg&#x27;s telling of the story. While the earliest extant sketches date from December 1856, it was not until August 1857 that Wagner began devoting his attention entirely to the opera, putting aside the composition of &quot;Siegfried&quot; to do so. On 20 August he began the prose sketch for the opera, and the libretto (or &quot;poem&quot;, as Wagner preferred to call it) was completed by 18 September. Wagner, at this time, had moved into a cottage built in the grounds of Wesendonck&#x27;s villa, where, during his work on &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, he became passionately involved with Mathilde Wesendonck. Whether or not this relationship was platonic remains uncertain. One evening in September of that year, Wagner read the finished poem of &quot;Tristan&quot; to an audience including his wife, Minna, his current muse, Mathilde, and his future mistress (and later wife), Cosima von Bülow.

By October 1857, Wagner had begun the composition sketch of the first act. During November, however, he set five of Mathilde&#x27;s poems to music known today as the &quot;Wesendonck Lieder&quot;. This was an unusual move by Wagner, who almost never set to music poetic texts other than his own. Wagner described two of the songs – &quot;Im Treibhaus&quot; and &quot;Träume&quot; – as &quot;Studies for Tristan und Isolde&quot;: &quot;Träume&quot; uses a motif that forms the love duet in Act II of &quot;Tristan&quot;, while &quot;Im Treibhaus&quot; introduces a theme that later became the prelude to Act III. But Wagner resolved to write &quot;Tristan&quot; only after he had secured a publishing deal with the Leipzig-based firm Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, in January 1858. From this point on, Wagner finished each act and sent it off for engraving before he started on the next – a remarkable feat given the unprecedented length and complexity of the score.

In April 1858 Wagner&#x27;s wife Minna intercepted a note from Wagner to Mathilde and, despite Wagner&#x27;s protests that she was putting a &quot;vulgar interpretation&quot; on the note, she accused first Wagner and then Mathilde of unfaithfulness. After enduring much misery, Wagner persuaded Minna, who had a heart condition, to rest at a spa while Otto Wesendonck took Mathilde to Italy. It was during the absence of the two women that Wagner began the composition sketch of the second act of &quot;Tristan&quot;. However, Minna&#x27;s return in July 1858 did not clear the air, and on 17 August, Wagner was forced to leave both Minna and Mathilde and move to Venice.

Wagner would later describe his last days in Zurich as &quot;a veritable Hell&quot;. Minna wrote to Mathilde before departing for Dresden: I must tell you with a bleeding heart that you have succeeded in separating my husband from me after nearly twenty-two years of marriage. May this noble deed contribute to your peace of mind, to your happiness.

Wagner finished the second act of &quot;Tristan&quot; during his eight-month exile in Venice, where he lived in the Palazzo Giustinian. In March 1859, fearing extradition to Saxony, where he was still considered a fugitive, Wagner moved to Lucerne where he composed the last act, completing it in August 1859.

===Premiere===
&quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; proved to be a difficult opera to stage, and Wagner considered various possibilities for the venue. In 1857 he was invited by a representative of Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil, to stage his operas in Rio de Janeiro (in Italian, the language of the Imperial Opera); he told Liszt he was considering settling in Rio, and that that city would be given the honour of premiering &quot;Tristan&quot;. Wagner sent the Emperor bound copies of his earlier operas in expression of his interest, but nothing more came of the plan. He then proposed that the premiere take place in Strasbourg, following interest in the project shown by the Grand Duchess of Baden. Again, the project failed to eventuate. His thoughts then turned to Paris, the centre of the operatic world in the middle of the 19th century. However, after a disastrous staging of &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; at the Paris Opéra, Wagner offered the work to the Karlsruhe opera in 1861.
When Wagner visited the Vienna Court Opera to rehearse possible singers for this production, the management at Vienna suggested staging the opera there. Originally, the tenor Alois Ander was employed to sing the part of Tristan, but later proved incapable of learning the role. Parallel attempts to stage the opera in Dresden, Weimar and Prague failed. Despite over 70 rehearsals between 1862 and 1864, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; was unable to be staged in Vienna, winning the opera a reputation as unperformable.

It was only after King Ludwig II of Bavaria became a sponsor of Wagner (he granted the composer a generous stipend and supported Wagner&#x27;s artistic endeavours in other ways) that enough resources could be found to mount the premiere of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. Hans von Bülow was chosen to conduct the production at the Nationaltheater in Munich, despite the fact that Wagner was having an affair with his wife, Cosima von Bülow. Even then, the planned premiere on 15 May 1865 had to be postponed until the Isolde, Malvina Schnorr von Carolsfeld, had recovered from hoarseness. The work finally premiered on 10 June 1865, with Malvina&#x27;s husband Ludwig partnering her as Tristan.

On 21 July 1865, having sung the role only four times, Ludwig died suddenly – prompting speculation that the exertion involved in singing the part of Tristan had killed him. (The stress of performing &quot;Tristan&quot; has also claimed the lives of conductors Felix Mottl in 1911 and Joseph Keilberth in 1968. Both men died after collapsing while conducting the second act of the opera.) Malvina sank into a deep depression over her husband&#x27;s death, and never sang again, although she lived for another 38 years.

For some years thereafter, the only performers of the roles were another husband–wife team, Heinrich Vogl and Therese Vogl.

==Performance history==

The next production of &quot;Tristan&quot; was in Weimar in 1874. Wagner himself supervised another production of &quot;Tristan&quot; in Berlin in March 1876, but the opera was only performed in his own theatre at the Bayreuth Festival after his death; Cosima Wagner, his widow, oversaw this in 1886, a production that was widely acclaimed.

The first production outside of Germany was given at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London in 1882; Tristan was performed by Hermann Winkelmann, who later that year sang the title role of &quot;Parsifal&quot; at Bayreuth. It was conducted by Hans Richter, who also conducted the first Covent Garden production two years later. Winkelmann was also the first Vienna Tristan, in 1883. The first American performance was held at the Metropolitan Opera in December 1886, conducted by Anton Seidl.

==Significance in the development of Western music==
The score of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; has often been cited as a landmark in the development of Western music. Throughout the opera, Wagner uses a remarkable range of orchestral colour, harmony, and polyphony, doing so with a freedom rarely found in his earlier operas. The first chord in the piece, the &quot;Tristan chord&quot;, is of great significance in the move away from traditional tonal harmony as it resolves to another dissonant chord:

&lt;/score&gt;
The opera is noted for its numerous expansions of harmonic practice; for instance, one significant innovation is the frequent use of two consecutive chords containing tritones (diminished fifth or augmented fourth), neither of which is a diminished seventh chord (F–B, bar 2; E–A, bar 3). &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; is also notable for its use of harmonic suspension – a device used by a composer to create musical tension by exposing the listener to a series of prolonged unfinished cadences, thereby inspiring a desire and expectation on the part of the listener for musical resolution. While suspension is a common compositional device (in use since before the Renaissance), Wagner was one of the first composers to employ harmonic suspension over the course of an entire work. The cadences first introduced in the prelude are not resolved until the finale of Act III, and, on a number of occasions throughout the opera, Wagner primes the audience for a musical climax with a series of chords building in tension – only to deliberately defer the anticipated resolution. One particular example of this technique occurs at the end of the love duet in Act II (&quot;Wie sie fassen, wie sie lassen...&quot;) where Tristan and Isolde gradually build up to a musical climax, only to have the expected resolution destroyed by the dissonant interruption of Kurwenal (&quot;Rette Dich, Tristan!&quot;). Resolution of the music does not occur until the very end of the opera, after Isolde sings the closing excerpt commonly referred to as the &quot;Liebestod&quot; (&quot;Love-Death&quot;), after which she sinks down, &quot;as if transfigured&quot;, dead onto Tristan&#x27;s body.

The tonality of &quot;Tristan&quot; was to prove immensely influential in western Classical music. Wagner&#x27;s use of musical colour also influenced the development of film music. Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s classic, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, is heavily reminiscent of the &quot;Liebestod&quot;, most evidently in the resurrection scene. The Liebestod was incorporated in Luis Buñuel&#x27;s Surrealist film &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot;. Not all composers, however, reacted favourably: Claude Debussy&#x27;s piano piece &quot;Golliwog&#x27;s Cakewalk&quot; mockingly quotes the opening of the opera in a distorted form, instructing the passage to be played &quot;. However, Debussy was highly influenced by Wagner and was particularly fond of &quot;Tristan.&quot; Frequent moments of &quot;Tristan&quot;-inspired tonality mark Debussy&#x27;s early compositions.

==Synopsis==
===Act 1===

Isolde, promised to King Marke in marriage, and her handmaid, Brangäne, are quartered aboard Tristan&#x27;s ship being transported to the king&#x27;s lands in Cornwall. The opera opens with the voice of a young sailor singing of a &quot;wild Irish maid&quot; (&quot;Westwärts schweift der Blick&quot;), which Isolde construes to be a mocking reference to herself. In a furious outburst, she wishes the seas to rise up and sink the ship, killing herself and all on board (&quot;Erwache mir wieder, kühne Gewalt&quot;). Her scorn and rage are directed particularly at Tristan, the knight responsible for taking her to Marke, and Isolde sends Brangäne to command Tristan to appear before her (&quot;Befehlen liess&#x27; dem Eigenholde&quot;). Tristan, however, refuses Brangäne&#x27;s request, claiming that his place is at the helm. His henchman, Kurwenal, answers more brusquely, saying that Isolde is in no position to command Tristan and reminds Brangäne that Isolde&#x27;s previous fiancé, Morold, was killed by Tristan (&quot;Herr Morold zog zu Meere her&quot;).

Brangäne returns to Isolde to relate these events, and Isolde, in what is termed the &quot;narrative and curse&quot;, sadly tells her of how, following the death of Morold, she happened upon a stranger who called himself Tantris. Tantris was found mortally wounded in a barge (&quot;von einem Kahn, der klein und arm&quot;) and Isolde used her healing powers to restore him to health. She discovered during Tantris&#x27; recovery, however, that he was actually Tristan, the murderer of her fiancé. Isolde attempted to kill the man with his own sword as he lay helpless before her. However, Tristan looked not at the sword that would kill him or the hand that wielded the sword, but into her eyes (&quot;Er sah&#x27; mir in die Augen&quot;). His gaze pierced her heart and she was unable to slay him. Tristan was allowed to leave with the promise never to come back, but he later returned with the intention of marrying Isolde to his uncle, King Marke. Isolde, furious at Tristan&#x27;s betrayal, insists that he drink atonement to her, and from her medicine chest produces a vial to make the drink. Brangäne is shocked to see that it is a lethal poison.

Kurwenal appears in the women&#x27;s quarters (&quot;Auf auf! Ihr Frauen!&quot;) and announces that the voyage is coming to an end. Isolde warns Kurwenal that she will not appear before the King if Tristan does not come before her as she had previously ordered and drink atonement to her. When Tristan arrives, Isolde reproaches him about his conduct and tells him that he owes her his life and how his actions have undermined her honour, since she blessed Morold&#x27;s weapons before battle and therefore she swore revenge. Tristan first offers his sword but Isolde refuses; they must drink atonement. Brangäne brings in the potion that will seal their pardon; Tristan knows that it may kill him, since he knows Isolde&#x27;s magic powers (&quot;Wohl kenn&#x27; ich Irlands Königin&quot;). The journey almost at its end, Tristan drinks and Isolde takes half the potion for herself. The potion seems to work, but instead of death, it brings relentless love (&quot;Tristan!&quot; &quot;Isolde!&quot;). Kurwenal, who announces the imminent arrival on board of King Marke, interrupts their rapture. Isolde asks Brangäne which potion she prepared and Brangäne replies, as the sailors hail the arrival of King Marke, that it was not poison; rather, she has substituted a love potion in order to save Isolde from herself.

===Act 2===
King Marke leads a hunting party out into the night, leaving Isolde and Brangäne alone in the castle. A torch is burning at the open door of Isolde&#x27;s apartments. Isolde, listening to the hunting horns, believes several times that the hunting party is far enough away to warrant extinguishing the torch – the prearranged signal for Tristan to join her (&quot;Nicht Hörnerschall tönt so hold&quot;). Brangäne warns Isolde that Melot, one of King Marke&#x27;s knights, has seen the amorous looks exchanged between Tristan and Isolde and suspects their passion (&quot;Ein Einz&#x27;ger war&#x27;s, ich achtet&#x27; es wohl&quot;). Isolde, however, believes Melot to be Tristan&#x27;s most loyal friend, and, in a frenzy of desire, extinguishes the flame. Brangäne retires to the ramparts to keep watch as Tristan arrives.

The lovers, at last alone and freed from the constraints of courtly life, declare their passion for each other. Tristan decries the realm of daylight which is false, unreal, and keeps them apart. It is only in night, he claims, that they can truly be together and only in the long night of death can they be eternally united (&quot;O sink&#x27; hernieder, Nacht der Liebe&quot;). During their long tryst, Brangäne calls a warning several times that the night is ending (&quot;Einsam wachend in der Nacht&quot;), but her cries fall upon deaf ears. The day breaks in on the lovers as Melot leads King Marke and his men to find Tristan and Isolde in each other&#x27;s arms. Marke is heartbroken, not only because of his nephew&#x27;s betrayal but also because Melot chose to betray his friend Tristan to Marke and because of Isolde&#x27;s betrayal as well (&quot;Mir – dies? Dies, Tristan – mir?&quot;).

When questioned, Tristan explains that he cannot reveal the reason for his betrayal to the King, as he believes the King wouldn&#x27;t understand. He then turns to Isolde, who agrees to accompany him once again into the realm of night. Tristan further reveals that Melot has also fallen in love with Isolde. A fight ensues between Melot and Tristan, but at a critical moment, Tristan deliberately throws his sword aside, allowing Melot to stab him.

===Act 3===

Kurwenal has brought Tristan home to his castle at Kareol in Brittany. A shepherd pipes a mournful tune and asks if Tristan is awake. Kurwenal replies that only Isolde&#x27;s arrival can save Tristan, and the shepherd offers to keep watch and claims that he will pipe a joyful tune to mark the arrival of any ship. Tristan awakes (&quot;Die alte Weise – was weckt sie mich?&quot;) and laments his fate – to be, once again, in the false realm of daylight, once more driven by unceasing unquenchable yearning (&quot;Wo ich erwacht&#x27; weilt ich nicht&quot;). Tristan&#x27;s sorrow ends when Kurwenal tells him that Isolde is on her way. Tristan, overjoyed, asks if her ship is in sight, but only a sorrowful tune from the shepherd&#x27;s pipe is heard.

Tristan relapses and recalls that the shepherd&#x27;s mournful tune is the same as was played when he was told of the deaths of his father and mother (&quot;Muss ich dich so versteh&#x27;n, du alte, ernst Weise&quot;). He rails once again against his desires and against the fateful love potion (&quot;verflucht sei, furchtbarer Trank!&quot;) until, exhausted, he collapses in delirium. After his collapse, the shepherd is heard piping the arrival of Isolde&#x27;s ship, and, as Kurwenal rushes to meet her, Tristan tears the bandages from his wounds in his excitement (&quot;Hahei! Mein Blut, lustig nun fliesse!&quot;). As Isolde arrives at his side, Tristan dies with her name on his lips.

Isolde collapses beside her deceased lover just as the appearance of another ship is announced. Kurwenal spies Melot, Marke and Brangäne arriving (&quot;Tod und Hölle! Alles zur Hand!&quot;). He believes they have come to kill Tristan and, in an attempt to avenge him, furiously attacks Melot. Marke tries to stop the fight to no avail. Both Melot and Kurwenal are killed in the fight. Marke and Brangäne finally reach Tristan and Isolde. Marke, grieving over the body of his &quot;truest friend&quot; (&quot;Tot denn alles!&quot;), explains that Brangäne revealed the secret of the love potion and that he had come not to part the lovers, but to unite them (&quot;Warum Isolde, warum mir das?&quot;). Isolde appears to wake at this and in a final aria describing her vision of Tristan risen again (the &quot;Liebestod&quot;, &quot;love death&quot;), dies (&quot;Mild und leise wie er lächelt&quot;).

==Influences==
===Schopenhauer===
Reading &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; by German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854 profoundly impacted Wagner and triggered in him a spiritual and artistic reassessment. Schopenhauer&#x27;s pessimistic worldview, his emphasis on the primacy of &quot;Will&quot; as the fundamental force of existence, and his notion that music is the highest of the arts because it directly expresses the Will resonated deeply with Wagner. In response, Wagner composed works such as &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot; and &quot;Parsifal&quot; whose libretti are pervaded with Schopenhauer&#x27;s ideas and whose music dominates the opera. This is in contrast to Wagner’s earlier theorizing in &quot;The Artwork of the Future&quot; (1849) that music, poetry, and drama should be balanced and serve as equal partners in the Gesamtkunstwerk.

Wagner gives heightened importance to music in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, often regarded as his most symphonically rich work. Unlike his other operas, Wagner wrote some music material for &quot;Tristan&quot; prior to completing the libretto. The music itself embodies Schopenhauer&#x27;s concept of the Will, a force that is inherently restless and never fully satisfied that drives all human urges and desires, leading to a cycle of longing and suffering. Wagner captures this in the musical structure of the opera through his use of unresolved harmonic tension and extreme chromaticism, creating a sense of perpetual yearning and lack of resolution. Only at the very end of the opera, when Isolde undergoes transfiguration and &quot;Love-Death&quot;, does the musical tension finally resolve. The passion of the music is often referred to as being &quot;sensual&quot; and &quot;erotic&quot;, this not only reflects the desires of the illicit lovers but is consistent with Schopenhauer&#x27;s position that the sexual urge is the most powerful manifestation of the Will.

Wagner uses the metaphors of &quot;Day&quot; and &quot;Night&quot; in the second act to designate the realms inhabited by Tristan and Isolde. The Day represents the external world of social obligations, duties, and constraints—embodied by King Marke&#x27;s court, where Tristan and Isolde must suppress their love and live according to the norms and expectations of society. This is a world of falsehood and deception because it requires them to deny their true feelings. The Night, by contrast, represents the inner world of truth, love, and authentic existence, where Tristan and Isolde can express their love freely and fully. It is a realm where the constraints of the external world are suspended, and their deepest desires can be realized. However, this realm is also linked to death, as true fulfillment and unity can only be achieved beyond the physical world.

Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy distinguishes between the world as &quot;Phenomenon&quot;—the world of appearances shaped by our perceptions and intellect—and the &quot;Noumenon&quot;, which refers to the underlying reality that is not directly accessible to us but is the true essence of existence. Wagner implicitly equates the realm of Day with Schopenhauer&#x27;s concept of Phenomenon and the realm of Night with the concept of Noumenon.

===Mysticism and Spirituality===
In the years leading up to 1857, when Wagner would set aside his work on &quot;The Ring&quot; to instead focus on &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, Wagner’s interests were dominated by spiritual matters. In 1855 his attention turned to Indian religion, reading Eugène Burnouf’s &quot;Introduction to the History of Indian Buddhism&quot;, and Hindu texts published in Adolf Holtzmann’s &quot;Indian Sagas&quot;. In addition to &quot;Tristan&quot;, this culminated in the conception of two additional operas at this time, &quot;Die Sieger&quot;, based on the life of the Buddhist monk Ānanda, and &quot;Parsifal&quot;, a Holy Grail quest based on the medieval poem &quot;Parzival&quot; by Wolfram von Eschenbach.

Wagner was interested in the Orient and already acquainted with Islamic mysticism prior to reading Schopenhauer in 1854, having written to his friend August Röckel in September 1852 declaring the Persian Sufi poet Hafez to be the &quot;greatest of all poets&quot;. Schopenhauer’s discussion of German Christian mystics, such as Meister Eckhart, further piqued Wagner’s interest in mysticism.

When Tristan and Isolde willingly drink the potion at the end of Act I but do not die, their eyes are opened to the illusions of material Day and to the higher spiritual insight of Night. Tristan celebrates the enlightenment brought about by the potion in Act II:

&lt;poem style=&quot;font-style:italic;margin-left:3em;&quot;&gt;
Oh hail the potion! Hail to the draft!
Hail to its magic&#x27;s magnificent craft!
Through the gates of Death, to me it flowed,
wide and open, for me it showed,
that which I&#x27;ve only dreamed to have sight,
the wondrous realm of Night!
&lt;/poem&gt;

Mythologist Joseph Campbell described this moment of drinking the potion as follows:

Māyā is a concept in the Indian religions that refers to the appearance of the material world, connoting a &quot;magic show, an illusion where things appear to be present but are not what they seem&quot;, and &quot;conceals the true character of spiritual reality&quot;; it finds its parallel in Schopenhauer’s &quot;Phenomenon&quot;. Tristan denounces the lying &quot;disguise&quot; of Day and resolves to yearn for and seek out only the &quot;Holy Night&quot;:

&lt;poem style=&quot;font-style:italic;margin-left:3em;&quot;&gt;
Oh, now we are with Night anointed!
The treacherous Day, with envy pointed,
could part us with its disguise,
but no longer cheat us with lies!
Amid the Day&#x27;s deluded churning,
remains one single yearning—
the yearning for the Holy Night,
where all-eternal&#x27;s solely true
Love does laugh with delight!
&lt;/poem&gt;

After expressing this sentiment, the famous Act II love duet, the &quot;Liebesnacht&quot; (&quot;O sink hernieder, Nacht der Liebe&quot;), begins. Here, Tristan and Isolde dedicate themselves to eternal Night and wish that Day would never come again, instead dying a transcendental &quot;Love-Death&quot; together as the ultimate consummation of their love. The music builds to ecstatic, mystically-elated climaxes, where they imagine the dissolution of their individual egos and merging into unity with each other and &quot;supreme love&quot;:

&lt;poem style=&quot;font-style:italic;margin-left:3em;&quot;&gt;
Tristan you, I Isolde, no longer Tristan!
You Isolde, Tristan I, no longer Isolde!
Without naming, without separating,
newly perceiving, newly igniting;
endless, eternal, one-consciousness:
a heart fervently burning with supreme love’s joy!
&lt;/poem&gt;

The themes of spiritual yearning in &quot;Tristan&quot; resonate with the introspective and passionate elements found in Christian mysticism, particularly the concept of &quot;unio mystica&quot;—the soul&#x27;s union with the divine. The character’s relentless pursuit of an idealized love that transcends earthly bounds and the notion of love leading to a metaphysical union can be seen as parallel to the Sufi pursuit of &quot;fana&quot;, the annihilation of the self in the universal presence of the divine.

The closing Liebestod, Isolde&#x27;s &quot;transfiguration&quot; sung before she dies, invokes Hindu and Buddhist sentiments. The German word for breath, Atem, is related etymologically to the Sanskrit word Ātman, meaning soul or eternal Self. Isolde sinking &quot;unconscious&quot; into a state of bliss is associated with the Buddhist concept of Nirvana, although Schopenhauer and Wagner at the time misunderstood this concept to imply a state of non-being:

&lt;poem style=&quot;font-style:italic;margin-left:3em;&quot;&gt;
In the unbounded swell,
in the resounding call,
in the world&#x27;s breath, flowing in all!
To drown...
to sink...
unconscious...
supreme bliss!
&lt;/poem&gt;

Wagner scholar John Pohanka has written on the spiritual influences in Wagner&#x27;s works, commenting that they not only contribute material to the libretto but how the power of the Wagnerian music and drama can itself invoke a transformative, ineffable experience in some audience members comparable to a mystical experience.

Given the influence of Schopenhauer and the apparent framing of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; as a tragedy, many have remarked on the opera’s &quot;pessimism.&quot; On this, British scholar George Ainslie Hight wrote in 1912:

==Reactions==
Although &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; is now widely performed in major opera houses around the world, critical opinion of the opera was initially unfavourable. The 5 July 1865 edition of the &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot; reported:
Eduard Hanslick&#x27;s reaction in 1868 to the prelude to &quot;Tristan&quot; was that it &quot;reminds one of the old Italian painting of a martyr whose intestines are slowly unwound from his body on a reel.&quot; The first performance in London&#x27;s Drury Lane Theatre drew the following response from &quot;The Era&quot; in 1882:
Mark Twain, on a visit to Germany, heard &quot;Tristan&quot; at Bayreuth and commented: &quot;I know of some, and have heard of many, who could not sleep after it, but cried the night away. I feel strongly out of place here. Sometimes I feel like the one sane person in the community of the mad; sometimes I feel like the one blind man where all others see; the one groping savage in the college of the learned, and always, during service, I feel like a heretic in heaven.&quot;

Clara Schumann wrote that &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; was &quot;the most repugnant thing I have ever seen or heard in all my life&quot;.

With the passage of time, &quot;Tristan&quot; became more favourably regarded. In an interview shortly before his death, Giuseppe Verdi said that he &quot;stood in wonder and terror&quot; before Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan&quot;. In &quot;The Perfect Wagnerite&quot;, the writer and satirist George Bernard Shaw writes that &quot;Tristan&quot; was &quot;an astonishingly intense and faithful translation into music of the emotions which accompany the union of a pair of lovers&quot; and described it as &quot;a poem of destruction and death&quot;. Richard Strauss, initially dismissive of &quot;Tristan,&quot; claimed that Wagner&#x27;s music &quot;would kill a cat and would turn rocks into scrambled eggs from fear of [its] hideous discords.&quot; Later, however, Strauss became part of the Bayreuth coterie and writing to Cosima Wagner in 1892 declared: &quot;I have conducted my first &quot;Tristan&quot;. It was the most wonderful day of my life.&quot; In 1935 he wrote to Joseph Gregor, one of his librettists, that &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; was &quot;the end of all romanticism, as it brings into focus the longing of the entire 19th century.&quot;

The conductor Bruno Walter heard his first &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; in 1889 as a student:
Arnold Schoenberg referred to Wagner&#x27;s technique of shifting chords in &quot;Tristan&quot; as &quot;phenomena of incredible adaptability and nonindependence roaming, homeless, among the spheres of keys; spies reconnoitering weaknesses; to exploit them in order to create confusion, deserters for whom surrender of their own personality is an end in itself&quot;.

Friedrich Nietzsche, who in his younger years was one of Wagner&#x27;s staunchest allies, wrote that, for him, &quot;&quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot; is the real &quot;opus metaphysicum&quot; of all art ... insatiable and sweet craving for the secrets of night and death ... it is overpowering in its simple grandeur&quot;. In a letter to his friend Erwin Rohde in October 1868, Nietzsche described his reaction to &quot;Tristan&#x27;s&quot; prelude: &quot;I simply cannot bring myself to remain critically aloof from this music; every nerve in me is atwitch, and it has been a long time since I had such a lasting sense of ecstasy as with this overture&quot;. Even after his break with Wagner, Nietzsche continued to consider &quot;Tristan&quot; a masterpiece: &quot;Even now I am still in search of a work which exercises such a dangerous fascination, such a spine-tingling and blissful infinity as &quot;Tristan&quot; – I have sought in vain, in every art.&quot;

Marcel Proust, greatly influenced by Wagner, refers to &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and its &quot;inexhaustible repetitions&quot; throughout his novel &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. He describes the prelude theme as &quot;linked to the future, to the reality of the human soul, of which it was one of the most special and distinctive ornaments.&quot;

==Recordings==
&quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; has a long recorded history and most of the major Wagner conductors since the end of the First World War have had their interpretations captured on disc. The limitations of recording technology meant that until the 1930s it was difficult to record the entire opera, however recordings of excerpts or single acts exist going back to 1901, when excerpts of Tristan were captured on the Mapleson Cylinders recorded during performances at the Metropolitan Opera.

In the years before World War II, Kirsten Flagstad and Lauritz Melchior were considered to be the prime interpreters of the lead roles, and mono recordings exist of this pair in a number of live performances led by conductors such as Thomas Beecham, Fritz Reiner, Artur Bodanzky and Erich Leinsdorf. Flagstad recorded the part commercially only near the end of her career in 1952, under Wilhelm Furtwängler for EMI, producing a set which is considered a classic recording.

Following the war, another classic recording is the 1952 performance at the Bayreuth Festival with Martha Mödl and Ramón Vinay under Herbert von Karajan, which is noted for its strong, vivid characterizations and is now available as a live recording. In the 1960s, the soprano Birgit Nilsson was considered the major Isolde interpreter, and she was often partnered with the Tristan of Wolfgang Windgassen. Their performance at Bayreuth in 1966 under the baton of Karl Böhm was captured by Deutsche Grammophon – a performance often hailed as one of the best &quot;Tristan&quot; recordings.

Karajan did not record the opera officially until 1971–72. Karajan&#x27;s selection of a lighter soprano voice (Helga Dernesch) as Isolde, paired with an extremely intense Jon Vickers and the unusual balance between orchestra and singers favoured by Karajan was controversial. In the 1980s recordings by conductors such as Carlos Kleiber, Reginald Goodall, and Leonard Bernstein were mostly considered to be important for the interpretation of the conductor, rather than that of the lead performers. The set by Kleiber is notable as Isolde was sung by the famous Mozartian soprano Margaret Price, who never sang the role of Isolde on stage. The same is true for Plácido Domingo, who sang the role of Tristan to critical acclaim in the 2005 EMI release under the baton of Antonio Pappano despite never having sung the role on stage. In the last ten years acclaimed sets include a studio recording with the Berlin Philharmonic by Daniel Barenboim and a live set from the Vienna Staatsoper led by Christian Thielemann.

There are several DVD productions of the opera including Götz Friedrich&#x27;s production at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin featuring the seasoned Wagnerians René Kollo and Dame Gwyneth Jones in the title roles. Deutsche Grammophon released a DVD of a Metropolitan Opera performance featuring Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner, conducted by James Levine, in a production staged by Dieter Dorn and a DVD of the 1993 Bayreuth Festival production with conductor Daniel Barenboim and featuring Waltraud Meier as Isolde and Siegfried Jerusalem as Tristan, staged by Heiner Müller. More recently Barenboim&#x27;s production at La Scala, Milan, in the production by Patrice Chéreau has also been issued on DVD. There is also a technically flawed, but historically important video recording with Birgit Nilsson and Jon Vickers from a 1973 live performance at the Théâtre antique d&#x27;Orange, conducted by Karl Böhm.

In a world first, the British opera house Glyndebourne made a full digital video download of the opera available for purchase online in 2009. The performance stars Robert Gambill as Tristan, Nina Stemme as Isolde, Katarina Karnéus as Brangäne, Bo Skovhus as Kurwenal, René Pape as King Marke, and Stephen Gadd as Melot, with Jiří Bělohlávek as the conductor, and was recorded on 1 and 6 August 2007.

A performance typically lasts approximately 3 hours and 50 minutes.

==Concert extracts and arrangements==
The &quot;Prelude and Liebestod&quot; is a concert version of the overture and Isolde&#x27;s Act III aria, &quot;Mild und leise&quot;. The arrangement was by Wagner himself, and it was first performed in 1862, several years before the premiere of the complete opera in 1865. The &quot;Liebestod&quot; can be performed either in a purely orchestral version, or with a soprano singing Isolde&#x27;s vision of Tristan resurrected.

However, the first time the prelude and its opening &quot;Tristan chord&quot; was heard publicly was on 12 March 1859, when it was performed at the Sophieninselsaal in Prague, in a charity concert in aid of poor medical students, conducted by Hans von Bülow, who provided his own concert ending for the occasion. Wagner had authorised such an ending, but did not like what Bülow had done with it and later wrote his own. Wagner then included the prelude in his own three concerts at the Paris Théâtre-Italien in January–February 1860.

Wagner called the prelude the &quot;Liebestod&quot; (Love-death) while Isolde&#x27;s final aria &quot;Mild und leise&quot; he called the &quot;Verklärung&quot; (). In 1867 his father-in-law Franz Liszt made a piano transcription of &quot;Mild und leise&quot;, which he called &quot;Liebestod&quot; (S.447); he prefaced his score with a four-bar motto from the love duet from Act II, which in the opera is sung to the words &quot;sehnend verlangter Liebestod&quot;. Liszt&#x27;s transcription became well known throughout Europe well before Wagner&#x27;s opera reached most places, and it is Liszt&#x27;s title for the final scene that persists. The transcription was revised in 1875.

Wagner wrote a concert ending for the Act II Love Duet for a planned 1862 concert performance that did not eventuate. The music was lost until 1950, then passed into private hands, before coming to the attention of Daniel Barenboim, who passed it on to Sir Antonio Pappano. The first recording of the Love Duet with the concert ending was made in 2000, with Plácido Domingo, Deborah Voigt and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House under Pappano.

Another composer to rework material from &quot;Tristan&quot; was Emmanuel Chabrier in his humorous &quot;Souvenirs de Munich – quadrilles on themes from Wagner&#x27;s Tristan und Isolde&quot;. These were augmented and orchestrated by Markus Lehmann in 1988. Leopold Stokowski made a series of purely orchestral &quot;Symphonic Syntheses&quot; of Wagner&#x27;s operas during his time as conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, bringing to concert audiences of the 1920s and &#x27;30s music they might not otherwise have heard. He made a &#x27;long version&#x27; of music from &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot; which consisted mainly of the Act I prelude, the from Act II and the from Act III. A shorter version of music from the 2nd and 3rd acts was called &quot;Love Music from &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;&quot;. He made recordings of both versions on 78s and again on LP.

The British composer Ronald Stevenson has made two arrangements based on the opera. The first is &quot;The Fugue on the Shepherd&#x27;s Air from Tristan und Isolde&quot; from 1999. Its composition was inspired by a lecture given by the Wagner biographer and chair of the Wagner Society of Scotland, Derek Watson, to whom the piece is dedicated. In a contrapuntal climax, Stevenson combines both the Shepherd&#x27;s Air and Isolde&#x27;s Liebestod. The second is a setting, for voices and organ, of lines from Tom Hubbard&#x27;s 1998 narrative poem in Scots, &#x27;Isolde&#x27;s Luve-Daith&#x27;, the premiere of which took place in Greyfriars Kirk, Edinburgh in March 2003.

Other works based on the opera include:
* Luis Buñuel, &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot;, 1929 film score, Opera Frankfurt, director Carl Bamberger
* Clément Doucet&#x27;s piano rags &quot;Isoldina&quot; and &quot;Wagneria&quot;.
* Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s &quot;Tristan: Préludes für Klavier, Tonbänder und Orchester&quot; (1973);
* a &#x27;symphonic compilation&#x27; &quot;Tristan und Isolde: an orchestral passion&quot; (1994) by Henk de Vlieger;
* a six-minute paraphrase by Enjott Schneider, &quot;Der Minuten-Tristan&quot; (1996), originally written for 12 pianists at six pianos;
* An arrangement of &quot;Prelude und Liebestod&quot; for string quartet and accordion, written for the Dudok Quartet Amsterdam (2021) by Max Knigge
* the &quot;Nachtstück&quot; (1980–83) for viola and chamber orchestra by Volker David Kirchner
* Franz Waxman, Fantasy based on themes from the opera, for violin and orchestra

==In popular culture==

Aubrey Beardsley&#x27;s pen and ink drawing &quot;The Wagnerites&quot; shows highly coiffured men and women attending a performance of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. The drawing was first published in the Yellow Book, vol III [October 1894]. According to Stephen Calloway, &#x27;Beardsley had an obsessive interest in Wagner, and avidly attended the London performances of the works. This depiction of the Wagnerian audience rather than the action of the opera identified by the fallen programme as Tristan and Isolde, is one of the greatest masterpieces of Beardsley&#x27;s manière noire. Sickert claimed to have warned him that the drawings in which the area of black exceeded that of white paper were bound to fail artistically, and to have &#x27;convinced him&#x27; of the truth of this aesthetic rule. Fortunately Beardsley seems to have ignored the advice.&#x27; The drawing is in the collection of The Victoria and Albert Museum.
The following year Beardsley produced a print depicting a stylised image of a woman, standing in front of a half length yellow curtain, wearing an ornate flowered hat and holding a large drinking vessel to her mouth. In the bottom right-hand corner is the word ISOLDE. &quot;Isolde&quot; was first reproduced in colour lithography (red, green, grey and black) as a supplement to The Studio, October 1895. The drawing (in yellow, black and white) is in the collection of The Victoria and Albert Museum.

The opera forms the backdrop of Horacio Quiroga&#x27;s tale of love lost, (The Death of Isolde) from his collection &quot;&quot; (1917).

In Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;The Birds&quot;, a recording of &quot;Tristan&quot; is prominently displayed in the scene in which Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) resignedly reveals to Melanie (Tippi Hedren) her unrequited love for Mitch. For Camille Paglia, the visual inclusion of the LP cover, with the opera&#x27;s &#x27;theme of self-immolation through doomed love&#x27; signifies that Annie is a forlorn romantic.

Dalit Warshaw&#x27;s concerto for piano and orchestra, &quot;Conjuring Tristan&quot;, draws on the opera&#x27;s leitmotifs to recast the narrative and dramatic events of Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;Tristan&quot; through Wagner&#x27;s music. Warshaw was inspired by developments in Mann&#x27;s mediation of the Tristan legend which see a former pianist&#x27;s love for music rekindled by the opera&#x27;s score.

Lars von Trier&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Melancholia&quot; prominently features music from the prelude.

The famous Liebestod is used in the soundtrack of the third episode of the first season of The Crown.

<doc id="38243" wikidata="Q951982" url="?curid=38243" title="Suspension of disbelief">
<text>Suspension of disbelief is the avoidance—often described as willing—of critical thinking and logic in understanding something that is unreal or impossible in reality, such as something in a work of speculative fiction, in order to believe it for the sake of enjoying its narrative. Historically, the concept originates in the Greco-Roman principles of theatre, wherein the audience ignores the unreality of fiction to experience catharsis from the actions and experiences of characters. 

The phrase was coined and elaborated upon by the English poet and philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge in his 1817 work &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;: &quot;that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic
faith&quot;.

== Origin ==
The phrase first appeared in English poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;, where he suggested that if an author could infuse a &quot;human interest and a semblance of truth&quot; into a story with implausible elements, the reader would willingly suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Coleridge was interested in returning fantastic elements to poetry and developed the concept to support how a modern, enlightened audience would continue to enjoy such types of literature. Coleridge suggested that his work, such as &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, his collaboration with William Wordsworth, essentially involved attempting to explain supernatural characters and events in plausible terms so that implausible characters and events of the imagination can seem to be truthful and present a greater contrast between fiction and reality. Coleridge also referred to this concept as &quot;poetic faith&quot;, citing the concept as a feeling analogous to the supernatural, which stimulates the mind&#x27;s faculties regardless of the irrationality of what is being understood.

Coleridge recalled:

This concept had previously been understood in antiquity, particularly in the Roman theoretical concerns of Horace and Cicero who wrote in a time of increasing skepticism about the supernatural. In Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ars Poetica&quot;, he used the quotation &quot;Ut pictura poesis&quot;, meaning &quot;as is painting so is poetry&quot;. According to David Chandler, Coleridge also originally drew his notion from Johann Jakob Brucker&#x27;s &quot;Historia Critica Philosophiae&quot; which cited the phrase &quot;assensus suspensione&quot; (&quot;suspension of assent&quot;); Brucker&#x27;s phrase was itself a modernization of the phrase &quot;adsensionis retentio&quot; (&quot;a holding back of assent&quot;) used by Cicero in his &quot;Academica&quot;.

== Concept ==
The traditional concept of the suspension of disbelief as proposed by Coleridge is not about suspending disbelief in the reality of fictional characters or events, but the suspension of disbelief in phenomena that is regarded as implausible. This can be demonstrated in the way a reader suspends disbelief in supernatural phenomena itself—simulating the feelings of a character that is experiencing the phenomena in the narrative of a story—rather than simply the implausibility of the phenomena in a story.

The phrase &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; came to be used more loosely in the later 20th century, often used to imply that the burden was on the reader, rather than the writer, to achieve it. This might be used to refer to the willingness of the audience to overlook the limitations of a medium, so that these do not interfere with the acceptance of those premises. These premises may also lend to the engagement of the mind and perhaps proposition of thoughts, ideas, art and theories. With a film, for instance, the viewer has to ignore the reality that they are viewing a staged performance and temporarily accept it as their reality in order to be entertained. Early black-and-white films are an example of visual media that require the audience to suspend their disbelief for this reason. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person&#x27;s ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.

== Examples in literature ==

Suspension of disbelief is sometimes said to be an essential component of live theater, where it was recognized by Shakespeare, who refers to it in the Prologue to &quot;Henry V&quot;: &quot;make imaginary [...] &#x27;tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings [...] turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass&quot;. Poetry and fiction involving the supernatural had gone out of fashion to a large extent in the 18th century, in part due to the declining belief in witches and other supernatural agents among the educated classes, who embraced the rational approach to the world offered by the new science. Alexander Pope, notably, felt the need to explain and justify his use of elemental spirits in &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;, one of the few English poems of the century that invoked the supernatural.

== Psychology ==
American psychological critic Norman N. Holland provided a neuroscientific theory of suspension of disbelief. Neurally, when a person engages with a narrative in a work of fiction, the brain goes wholly into a perceiving mode, engaging less intensely with the faculties for acting or planning to act; &quot;poetic faith&quot; is a willing act that is supported by the value of a narrative that is being engaged with. When the person stops perceiving to think about what has been seen or heard, its &quot;truth-value&quot; is assessed.

== Criticisms ==
Aesthetic philosophers generally reject claims that a &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; can accurately characterize the relationship between people and &quot;fictions&quot;. American philosopher Kendall Walton noted that if viewers were to &quot;truly&quot; suspend disbelief when viewing a horror movie and accept its images as absolute fact, they would have a true-to-life set of reactions that are impractical and contradict the safety of the leisure of viewing the movie. For instance, if this logic generally applied, then audience members would try to help endangered on-screen characters, or call authorities when witnessing on-screen murders.

Not all authors believe that &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; adequately characterizes the audience&#x27;s relationship to imaginative works of art. challenged this concept in &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot;, choosing instead the paradigm of &quot;secondary belief&quot; based on inner consistency of reality: in order for the narrative to work, the reader must believe that what they read is true &quot;within&quot; the secondary reality of the fictional world. By focusing on creating an internally consistent fictional world, the author makes secondary belief possible. Tolkien argued that suspension of disbelief is only necessary when the work has failed to create secondary belief, saying that from that point on, the reader ceases to be immersed in the story and so must make a conscious effort to suspend their disbelief or else give up on it entirely.

<doc id="38245" wikidata="Q192941" url="?curid=38245" title="Tosca">
<text>Tosca is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou&#x27;s 1887 French-language dramatic play, &quot;La Tosca&quot;, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples&#x27;s control of Rome threatened by Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder, and suicide, as well as some of Puccini&#x27;s best-known lyrical arias.

Puccini saw Sardou&#x27;s play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. &quot;Tosca&quot; premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public.

Musically, &quot;Tosca&quot; is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot—musicologist Joseph Kerman famously called it a &quot;shabby little shocker&quot;—the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of &quot;Tosca&quot; and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances.

== Background ==
The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, &quot;La Tosca&quot;, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.

Puccini had seen &quot;La Tosca&quot; at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou&#x27;s permission for the work to be made into an opera: &quot;I see in this &quot;Tosca&quot; the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.&quot;

Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception &quot;La Tosca&quot; had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.

In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment.

When Puccini once again became interested in &quot;Tosca&quot;, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand gesture, saying, &quot;He has more talent than I do.&quot; American scholar Deborah Burton contends that Franchetti gave it up simply because he saw little merit in it and could not feel the music in the play. Whatever the reason, Franchetti surrendered the rights in May 1895, and in August Puccini signed a contract to resume control of the project.

== Roles ==
== Synopsis ==

=== Historical context ===
According to the libretto, the action of &quot;Tosca&quot; occurs in Rome in June 1800. Sardou, in his play, dates it more precisely; &quot;La Tosca&quot; takes place in the afternoon, evening, and early morning of 17 and 18 June 1800.

Italy had long been divided into a number of small states, with the Pope in Rome ruling the Papal States in Central Italy. Following the French Revolution, a French army under Napoleon invaded Italy in 1796, entering Rome almost unopposed on 11 February 1798 and establishing a republic there. Pope Pius VI was taken prisoner, and was sent into exile on February 20, 1798. (Pius VI would die in exile in 1799, and his successor, Pius VII, who was elected in Venice on 14 March 1800, would not enter Rome until 3 July. There is thus neither a Pope nor papal government in Rome during the days depicted in the opera). The new republic was ruled by seven consuls; in the opera this is the office formerly held by Angelotti, whose character may be based on the real-life consul Liborio Angelucci. In September 1799 the French, who had protected the republic, withdrew from Rome. As they left, troops of the Kingdom of Naples occupied the city.

In May 1800 Napoleon, by then the undisputed leader of France, brought his troops across the Alps to Italy once again. On 14 June his army met the Austrian forces at the Battle of Marengo (near Alessandria). Austrian troops were initially successful; by mid-morning they were in control of the field of battle. Their commander, Michael von Melas, sent this news south towards Rome. However, fresh French troops arrived in the late afternoon, and Napoleon attacked the tired Austrians. As Melas retreated in disarray with the remains of his army, he sent a second courier south with the revised message. The Neapolitans abandoned Rome, and the city spent the next fourteen years under French domination.

=== Act 1 ===
&quot;Inside the church of Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle&quot;

Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds.

The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti&#x27;s sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the &quot;hidden harmony&quot; (&quot;Recondita armonia&quot;) in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving.

Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca&#x27;s voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place.

Tosca enters and suspiciously asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing – she thinks that he has been talking to another woman. After Cavaradossi reassures her, Tosca tries to persuade him to take her to his villa that evening: &quot;Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta&quot; (&quot;Do you not long for our little cottage&quot;). She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she recognises as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the church. He reassures Tosca of his fidelity and asks her what eyes could be more beautiful than her own: &quot;Qual&#x27;occhio al mondo&quot; (&quot;What eyes in the world&quot;).

After Tosca has left, Angelotti reappears and discusses with the painter his plan to flee disguised as a woman, using clothes left in the chapel by his sister. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti a key to his villa, suggesting that he hide in a disused well in the garden. The sound of a cannon signals that Angelotti&#x27;s escape has been discovered. He and Cavaradossi hasten out of the church.
The Sacristan re-enters with choristers, celebrating the news that Napoleon has apparently been defeated at Marengo. The celebrations cease abruptly with the entry of Scarpia, his henchman Spoletta and several police agents. They have heard that Angelotti has sought refuge in the church. Scarpia orders a search, and the empty food basket and a fan bearing the Attavanti coat of arms are found in the chapel. Scarpia questions the Sacristan, and his suspicions are aroused further when he learns that Cavaradossi has been in the church; Scarpia mistrusts the painter, and believes him complicit in Angelotti&#x27;s escape.

When Tosca arrives looking for her lover, Scarpia artfully arouses her jealous instincts by implying a relationship between the painter and the Marchesa Attavanti. He draws Tosca&#x27;s attention to the fan and suggests that someone must have surprised the lovers in the chapel. Tosca falls for his deceit; enraged, she rushes off to confront Cavaradossi. Scarpia orders Spoletta and his agents to follow her, assuming she will lead them to Cavaradossi and Angelotti. He privately gloats as he reveals his intentions to possess Tosca and execute Cavaradossi. A procession enters the church singing the Te Deum; exclaiming &#x27;Tosca, you make me forget even God!&#x27;, Scarpia joins the chorus in the prayer.

=== Act 2 ===
&quot;Scarpia&#x27;s apartment in the Palazzo Farnese, that evening&quot;

Scarpia, at supper, sends a note to Tosca asking her to come to his apartment, anticipating that two of his goals will soon be fulfilled at once. His agent, Spoletta, arrives to report that Angelotti remains at large, but Cavaradossi has been arrested for questioning. He is brought in, and an interrogation ensues. As the painter steadfastly denies knowing anything about Angelotti&#x27;s escape, Tosca&#x27;s voice is heard singing a celebratory cantata elsewhere in the Palace.

She enters the apartment in time to see Cavaradossi being escorted to an antechamber. All he has time to say is that she mustn&#x27;t tell them anything. Scarpia then claims she can save her lover from indescribable pain if she reveals Angelotti&#x27;s hiding place. She resists, but the sound of screams coming through the door eventually breaks her down, and she tells Scarpia to search the well in the garden of Cavaradossi&#x27;s villa.

Scarpia orders his torturers to cease, and the bloodied painter is dragged back in. He is devastated to discover that Tosca has betrayed his friend. Sciarrone, another agent, then enters with news: there was an unexpected turn on the battlefield at Marengo, and the French are marching on Rome. Cavaradossi, unable to contain himself, gloats to Scarpia that his rule of terror will soon be at an end. This is enough for the police to consider him guilty, and they haul him away to be executed.

Scarpia, now alone with Tosca, proposes a bargain: if she gives herself to him, Cavaradossi will be freed. She is revolted, and repeatedly rejects his advances, but she hears the drums outside announcing an execution. As Scarpia awaits her decision, she prays, asking why God has abandoned her in her hour of need: &quot;Vissi d&#x27;arte&quot; (&quot;I lived for art&quot;). She tries to offer money, but Scarpia is not interested in that kind of bribe: he wants Tosca herself.
Spoletta returns with the news that Angelotti has killed himself upon discovery, and that everything is in place for Cavaradossi&#x27;s execution. Scarpia hesitates to give the order, looking to Tosca, and despairingly she agrees to submit to him. He tells Spoletta to arrange a mock execution, both men repeating that it will be &quot;as we did with Count Palmieri&quot;, and Spoletta exits.

Tosca insists that Scarpia must provide safe-conduct out of Rome for herself and Cavaradossi. He easily agrees to this and heads to his desk. While he&#x27;s drafting the document, she quietly takes a knife from the supper table. Scarpia triumphantly strides toward Tosca. When he begins to embrace her, she stabs him, crying &quot;this is Tosca&#x27;s kiss!&quot; Once she&#x27;s certain he&#x27;s dead, she ruefully says &quot;now I forgive him.&quot; She removes the safe-conduct from his pocket, lights candles in a gesture of piety, and places a crucifix on the body before leaving.

=== Act 3 ===
&quot;The upper parts of the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo, early the following morning&quot;

A shepherd boy is heard offstage singing (in Romanesco dialect) &quot;Io de&#x27; sospiri&quot; (&quot;I give you sighs&quot;) as church bells sound for matins. The guards lead Cavaradossi in and a jailer informs him that he has one hour to live. He declines to see a priest, but asks permission to write a letter to Tosca. He begins to write, but is soon overwhelmed by memories: &quot;E lucevan le stelle&quot; (&quot;And the stars shone&quot;).

Tosca enters and shows him the safe-conduct pass she has obtained, adding that she has killed Scarpia and that the imminent execution is a sham. Cavaradossi must feign death, after which they can flee together before Scarpia&#x27;s body is discovered. Cavaradossi is awestruck by his gentle lover&#x27;s courage: &quot;O dolci mani&quot; (&quot;Oh sweet hands&quot;). The pair ecstatically imagine the life they will share, far from Rome. Tosca then anxiously coaches Cavaradossi on how to play dead when the firing squad shoots at him with blanks. He promises he will fall &quot;like Tosca in the theatre&quot;.

Cavaradossi is led away, and Tosca watches with increasing impatience as the firing squad prepares. The men fire, and Tosca praises the realism of his fall, &quot;Ecco un artista!&quot; (&quot;What an actor!&quot;). Once the soldiers have left, she hurries towards Cavaradossi, urging him, &quot;Mario, su presto!&quot; (&quot;Mario, up quickly!&quot;), only to find that Scarpia betrayed her: the bullets were real. Heartbroken, she clasps her lover&#x27;s lifeless body and weeps.

The voices of Spoletta, Sciarrone, and the soldiers are heard, shouting that Scarpia is dead and Tosca has killed him. As the men rush in, Tosca rises, evades their clutches, and runs to the parapet. Crying &quot;O Scarpia, avanti a Dio!&quot; (&quot;O Scarpia, we meet before God!&quot;), she flings herself over the edge to her death.

== Adaptation and writing ==
Sardou&#x27;s five-act play &quot;La Tosca&quot; contains a large amount of dialogue and exposition. While the broad details of the play are present in the opera&#x27;s plot, the original work contains many more characters and much detail not present in the opera. In the play the lovers are portrayed as though they were French: the character Floria Tosca is closely modelled on Bernhardt&#x27;s personality, while her lover Cavaradossi, of Roman descent, is born in Paris. Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, the playwright who joined the project to polish the verses, needed not only to cut back the play drastically, but to make the characters&#x27; motivations and actions suitable for Italian opera. Giacosa and Puccini repeatedly clashed over the condensation, with Giacosa feeling that Puccini did not really want to complete the project.

The first draft libretto that Illica produced for Puccini resurfaced in 2000 after being lost for many years. It contains considerable differences from the final libretto, relatively minor in the first two acts but much more appreciable in the third, where the description of the Roman dawn that opens the third act is much longer, and Cavaradossi&#x27;s tragic aria, the eventual &quot;E lucevan le stelle&quot;, has different words. The 1896 libretto also offers a different ending, in which Tosca does not die but instead goes mad. In the final scene, she cradles her lover&#x27;s head in her lap and hallucinates that she and her Mario are on a gondola, and that she is asking the gondolier for silence. Sardou refused to consider this change, insisting that as in the play, Tosca must throw herself from the parapet to her death. Puccini agreed with Sardou, telling him that the mad scene would have the audiences anticipate the ending and start moving towards the cloakrooms. Puccini pressed his librettists hard, and Giacosa issued a series of melodramatic threats to abandon the work. The two librettists were finally able to give Puccini what they hoped was a final version of the libretto in 1898.

Little work was done on the score during 1897, which Puccini devoted mostly to performances of &quot;La bohème&quot;. The opening page of the autograph &quot;Tosca&quot; score, containing the motif that would be associated with Scarpia, is dated January 1898. At Puccini&#x27;s request, Giacosa irritably provided new lyrics for the act 1 love duet. In August, Puccini removed several numbers from the opera, according to his biographer, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz, &quot;cut[ting] &quot;Tosca&quot; to the bone, leaving three strong characters trapped in an airless, violent, tightly wound melodrama that had little room for lyricism&quot;. At the end of the year, Puccini wrote that he was &quot;busting his balls&quot; on the opera.

Puccini asked clerical friends for words for the congregation to mutter at the start of the act 1 Te Deum; when nothing they provided satisfied him, he supplied the words himself. For the Te Deum music, he investigated the melodies to which the hymn was set in Roman churches, and sought to reproduce the cardinal&#x27;s procession authentically, even to the uniforms of the Swiss Guards. He adapted the music to the exact pitch of the great bell of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, and was equally diligent when writing the music that opens act 3, in which Rome awakens to the sounds of church bells. He journeyed to Rome and went to the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo to measure the sound of matins bells there, as they would be heard from its ramparts. Puccini had bells for the Roman dawn cast to order by four different foundries. This apparently did not have its desired effect, as Illica wrote to Ricordi on the day after the premiere, &quot;the great fuss and the large amount of money for the bells have constituted an additional folly, because it passes completely unnoticed&quot;. Nevertheless, the bells provide a source of trouble and expense to opera companies performing &quot;Tosca&quot; to this day.

In act 2, when Tosca sings offstage the cantata that celebrates the supposed defeat of Napoleon, Puccini was tempted to follow the text of Sardou&#x27;s play and use the music of Giovanni Paisiello, before finally writing his own imitation of Paisello&#x27;s style. It was not until 29 September 1899 that Puccini was able to mark the final page of the score as completed. Despite the notation, there was additional work to be done, such as the shepherd boy&#x27;s song at the start of act 3. Puccini, who always sought to put local colour in his works, wanted that song to be in Roman dialect. The composer asked a friend to have a &quot;good romanesco poet&quot; write some words; eventually the poet and folklorist wrote the verse which, after slight modification, was placed in the opera.

In October 1899, Ricordi realized that some of the music for Cavaradossi&#x27;s act 3 aria, &quot;O dolci mani&quot; was borrowed from music Puccini had cut from his early opera, &quot;Edgar&quot; and demanded changes. Puccini defended his music as expressive of what Cavaradossi must be feeling at that point, and offered to come to Milan to play and sing act 3 for the publisher. Ricordi was overwhelmed by the completed act 3 prelude, which he received in early November, and softened his views, though he was still not completely happy with the music for &quot;O dolci mani&quot;. In any event time was too short before the scheduled January 1900 premiere to make any further changes.

== Reception and performance history ==

=== Premiere ===

By December 1899, &quot;Tosca&quot; was in rehearsal at the Teatro Costanzi. Because of the Roman setting, Ricordi arranged a Roman premiere for the opera, even though this meant that Arturo Toscanini could not conduct it as Puccini had planned—Toscanini was fully engaged at La Scala in Milan. Leopoldo Mugnone was appointed to conduct. The accomplished (but temperamental) soprano Hariclea Darclée was selected for the title role; Eugenio Giraldoni, whose father had originated many Verdi roles, became the first Scarpia. The young Enrico Caruso had hoped to create the role of Cavaradossi, but was passed over in favour of the more experienced Emilio De Marchi. The performance was to be directed by Nino Vignuzzi, with stage designs by Adolfo Hohenstein.

At the time of the premiere, Italy had experienced political and social unrest for several years. The start of the Holy Year in December 1899 attracted the religious to the city, but also brought threats from anarchists and other anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist bombing of the theatre, and instructed Mugnone (who had survived a theatre bombing in Barcelona), that in an emergency he was to strike up the royal march. The unrest caused the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14 January.

By 1900, the premiere of a Puccini opera was a national event. Many Roman dignitaries attended, as did Queen Margherita, though she arrived late, after the first act. The Prime Minister of Italy, Luigi Pelloux was present, with several members of his cabinet. A number of Puccini&#x27;s operatic rivals were there, including Franchetti, Pietro Mascagni, Francesco Cilea and Ildebrando Pizzetti. Shortly after the curtain was raised there was a disturbance in the back of the theatre, caused by latecomers attempting to enter the auditorium, and a shout of &quot;Bring down the curtain!&quot;, at which Mugnone stopped the orchestra. A few moments later the opera began again, and proceeded without further disruption.

The performance, while not quite the triumph that Puccini had hoped for, was generally successful, with numerous encores. Much of the critical and press reaction was lukewarm, often blaming Illica&#x27;s libretto. In response, Illica condemned Puccini for treating his librettists &quot;like stagehands&quot; and reducing the text to a shadow of its original form. Nevertheless, any public doubts about &quot;Tosca&quot; soon vanished; the premiere was followed by twenty performances, all given to packed houses.

=== Subsequent productions ===
The Milan premiere at La Scala took place under Toscanini on 17 March 1900. Darclée and Giraldoni reprised their roles; the prominent tenor Giuseppe Borgatti replaced De Marchi as Cavaradossi. The opera was a great success at La Scala, and played to full houses.

The first known performance of &quot;Tosca&quot; outside Italy was in Buenos Aires. The opera was produced at the Teatro de la Opera on 16 June 1900.

Puccini travelled to London for the British premiere at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 12 July, with Milka Ternina and Fernando De Lucia as the doomed lovers and Antonio Scotti as Scarpia. Puccini wrote that &quot;Tosca&quot; was &quot;[a] complete triumph&quot;, and Ricordi&#x27;s London representative quickly signed a contract to take &quot;Tosca&quot; to New York. The premiere at the Metropolitan Opera was on 4 February 1901, with De Lucia&#x27;s replacement by Giuseppe Cremonini the only change from the London cast. For its French premiere at the Opéra-Comique on 13 October 1903, the 72-year-old Sardou took charge of all the action on the stage. Puccini was delighted with the public&#x27;s reception of the work in Paris, despite adverse comments from critics. The opera was subsequently premiered at venues throughout Europe, the Americas, Australia and the Far East; by the outbreak of war in 1914 it had been performed in more than 50 cities worldwide.

Among the prominent early Toscas was Emmy Destinn, who sang the role regularly in a long-standing partnership with the tenor Enrico Caruso. Maria Jeritza, over many years at the Met and in Vienna, brought her own distinctive style to the role, and was said to be Puccini&#x27;s favorite Tosca. Jeritza was the first to deliver &quot;Vissi d&#x27;arte&quot; from a prone position, having fallen to the stage while eluding the grasp of Scarpia. This was a great success, and Jeritza sang the aria while on the floor thereafter. Of her successors, opera enthusiasts tend to consider Maria Callas as the supreme interpreter of the role, largely on the basis of her performances at the Royal Opera House in 1964, with Tito Gobbi as Scarpia. This production, by Franco Zeffirelli, remained in continuous use at Covent Garden for more than 40 years until replaced in 2006 by a new staging, which premiered with Angela Gheorghiu. Callas had first sung Tosca at age 18 in a performance given in Greek, in the Greek National Opera in Athens on 27 August 1942. Tosca was also her last on-stage operatic role, in a special charity performance at the Royal Opera House on 7 May 1965.

Among non-traditional productions, Luca Ronconi, in 1996 at La Scala, used distorted and fractured scenery to represent the twists of fate reflected in the plot. Jonathan Miller, in a 1986 production for the 49th &quot;Maggio Musicale Fiorentino&quot;, transferred the action to Nazi-occupied Rome in 1944, with Scarpia as head of the fascist police. In production on the Lake Stage at the Bregenz Festival in 2007 the act 1 set, designed by Johannes Leiacker, was dominated by a huge Orwellian &quot;Big Brother&quot; eye. The iris opens and closes to reveal surreal scenes beyond the action. This production updates the story to a modern Mafia scenario, with special effects &quot;worthy of a Bond film&quot;.

In 1992 a television version of the opera was filmed at the locations prescribed by Puccini, at the times of day at which each act takes place. Featuring Catherine Malfitano, Plácido Domingo and Ruggero Raimondi, the performance was broadcast live throughout Europe. Luciano Pavarotti, who sang Cavaradossi from the late 1970s, appeared in a special performance in Rome, with Plácido Domingo as conductor, on 14 January 2000, to celebrate the opera&#x27;s centenary. Pavarotti&#x27;s last stage performance was as Cavaradossi at the Met, on 13 March 2004.

Early Cavaradossis played the part as if the painter believed that he was reprieved, and would survive the &quot;mock&quot; execution. Beniamino Gigli, who performed the role many times in his forty-year operatic career, was one of the first to assume that the painter knows, or strongly suspects, that he will be shot. Gigli wrote in his autobiography: &quot;he is certain that these are their last moments together on earth, and that he is about to die&quot;. Domingo, the dominant Cavaradossi of the 1970s and 1980s, concurred, stating in a 1985 interview that he had long played the part that way. Gobbi, who in his later years often directed the opera, commented, &quot;Unlike Floria, Cavaradossi knows that Scarpia never yields, though he pretends to believe in order to delay the pain for Tosca.&quot;

=== Critical reception ===
The enduring popularity of &quot;Tosca&quot; has not been matched by consistent critical enthusiasm. After the premiere, Ippolito Valetta of &quot;Nuova antologia&quot; wrote, &quot;[Puccini] finds in his palette all colours, all shades; in his hands, the instrumental texture becomes completely supple, the gradations of sonority are innumerable, the blend unfailingly grateful to the ear.&quot; However, one critic described act 2 as overly long and wordy; another echoed Illica and Giacosa in stating that the rush of action did not permit enough lyricism, to the great detriment of the music. A third called the opera &quot;three hours of noise&quot;.

The critics gave the work a generally kinder reception in London, where &quot;The Times&quot; called Puccini &quot;a master in the art of poignant expression&quot;, and praised the &quot;wonderful skill and sustained power&quot; of the music. In &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, Puccini&#x27;s score was admired for its sincerity and &quot;strength of utterance.&quot; After the 1903 Paris opening, the composer Paul Dukas thought the work lacked cohesion and style, while Gabriel Fauré was offended by &quot;disconcerting vulgarities&quot;. In the 1950s, the young musicologist Joseph Kerman described &quot;Tosca&quot; as a &quot;shabby little shocker.&quot;; in response the conductor Thomas Beecham remarked that anything Kerman says about Puccini &quot;can safely be ignored&quot;. Writing half a century after the premiere, the veteran critic Ernest Newman, while acknowledging the &quot;enormously difficult business of boiling [Sardou&#x27;s] play down for operatic purposes&quot;, thought that the subtleties of Sardou&#x27;s original plot are handled &quot;very lamely&quot;, so that &quot;much of what happens, and why, is unintelligible to the spectator&quot;. Overall, however, Newman delivered a more positive judgement: &quot;[Puccini&#x27;s] operas are to some extent a mere bundle of tricks, but no one else has performed the same tricks nearly as well&quot;. Opera scholar Julian Budden remarks on Puccini&#x27;s &quot;inept handling of the political element&quot;, but still hails the work as &quot;a triumph of pure theatre&quot;. Music critic Charles Osborne ascribes &quot;Tosca&quot;&#x27;s immense popularity with audiences to the taut effectiveness of its melodramatic plot, the opportunities given to its three leading characters to shine vocally and dramatically, and the presence of two great arias in &quot;Vissi d&#x27;arte&quot; and &quot;E lucevan le stelle&quot;. The work remains popular today: according to Operabase, it ranks as fifth in the world with 540 performances given in the five seasons 2009–10 to 2013–14.

== Music ==
=== General style ===
By the end of the 19th century the classic form of opera structure, in which arias, duets and other set-piece vocal numbers are interspersed with passages of recitative or dialogue, had been largely abandoned, even in Italy. Operas were &quot;through-composed&quot;, with a continuous stream of music which in some cases eliminated all identifiable set-pieces. In what critic Edward Greenfield calls the &quot;Grand Tune&quot; concept, Puccini retains a limited number of set-pieces, distinguished from their musical surroundings by their memorable melodies. Even in the passages linking these &quot;Grand Tunes&quot;, Puccini maintains a strong degree of lyricism and only rarely resorts to recitative.

Budden describes &quot;Tosca&quot; as the most Wagnerian of Puccini&#x27;s scores, in its use of musical leitmotifs. Unlike Wagner, Puccini does not develop or modify his motifs, nor weave them into the music symphonically, but uses them to refer to characters, objects and ideas, and as reminders within the narrative. The most potent of these motifs is the sequence of three very loud and strident chords which open the opera and which represent the evil character of Scarpia—or perhaps, Charles Osborne proposes, the violent atmosphere that pervades the entire opera. Budden has suggested that Scarpia&#x27;s tyranny, lechery and lust form &quot;the dynamic engine that ignites the drama&quot;. Other motifs identify Tosca herself, the love of Tosca and Cavaradossi, the fugitive Angelotti, the semi-comical character of the sacristan in act 1 and the theme of torture in act 2.

=== Act 1 ===
The opera begins without any prelude; the opening chords of the Scarpia motif lead immediately to the agitated appearance of Angelotti and the enunciation of the &quot;fugitive&quot; motif. The sacristan&#x27;s entry, accompanied by his sprightly buffo theme, lifts the mood, as does the generally light-hearted colloquy with Cavaradossi which follows after the latter&#x27;s entrance. This leads to the first of the &quot;Grand Tunes&quot;, Cavaradossi&#x27;s &quot;Recondita armonia&quot; with its sustained high B flat, accompanied by the sacristan&#x27;s grumbling counter-melody. The domination, in that aria, of themes which will be repeated in the love duet make it clear that though the painting may incorporate the Marchesa&#x27;s features, Tosca is the ultimate inspiration of his work. Cavaradossi&#x27;s dialogue with Angelotti is interrupted by Tosca&#x27;s arrival, signalled by her motif which incorporates, in Newman&#x27;s words, &quot;the feline, caressing cadence so characteristic of her.&quot; Though Tosca enters violently and suspiciously, the music paints her devotion and serenity. According to Budden, there is no contradiction: Tosca&#x27;s jealousy is largely a matter of habit, which her lover does not take too seriously.

After Tosca&#x27;s &quot;Non la sospiri&quot; and the subsequent argument inspired by her jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet &quot;Qual&#x27;occhio&quot; provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as &quot;an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony&quot;. The brief scene in which the sacristan returns with the choristers to celebrate Napoleon&#x27;s supposed defeat provides almost the last carefree moments in the opera; after the entrance of Scarpia to his menacing theme, the mood becomes sombre, then steadily darker. As the police chief interrogates the sacristan, the &quot;fugitive&quot; motif recurs three more times, each time more emphatically, signalling Scarpia&#x27;s success in his investigation. In Scarpia&#x27;s exchanges with Tosca the sound of tolling bells, interwoven with the orchestra, creates an almost religious atmosphere, for which Puccini draws on music from his then unpublished Mass of 1880. The final scene in the act is a juxtaposition of the sacred and the profane, as Scarpia&#x27;s lustful reverie is sung alongside the swelling Te Deum chorus. He joins with the chorus in the final statement &quot;Te aeternum Patrem omnis terra veneratur&quot; (&quot;Everlasting Father, all the earth worships thee&quot;), before the act ends with a thunderous restatement of the Scarpia motif.

=== Act 2 ===

In the second act of &quot;Tosca&quot;, according to Newman, Puccini rises to his greatest height as a master of the musical macabre. The act begins quietly, with Scarpia musing on the forthcoming downfall of Angelotti and Cavaradossi, while in the background a gavotte is played in a distant quarter of the Farnese Palace. For this music Puccini adapted a fifteen-year-old student exercise by his late brother, Michele, stating that in this way his brother could live again through him. In the dialogue with Spoletta, the &quot;torture&quot; motif—an &quot;ideogram of suffering&quot;, according to Budden—is heard for the first time as a foretaste of what is to come. As Cavaradossi is brought in for interrogation, Tosca&#x27;s voice is heard with the offstage chorus singing a cantata, &quot;[its] suave strains contrast[ing] dramatically with the increasing tension and ever-darkening colour of the stage action&quot;. The cantata is most likely the &quot;Cantata a Giove&quot;, in the literature referred to as a lost work of Puccini&#x27;s from 1897.

Osborne describes the scenes that follow—Cavaradossi&#x27;s interrogation, his torture, Scarpia&#x27;s sadistic tormenting of Tosca—as Puccini&#x27;s musical equivalent of &quot;grand guignol&quot; to which Cavaradossi&#x27;s brief &quot;Vittoria! Vittoria!&quot; on the news of Napoleon&#x27;s victory gives only partial relief. Scarpia&#x27;s aria &quot;Già, mi dicon venal&quot; (&quot;Yes, they say I am venal&quot;) is closely followed by Tosca&#x27;s &quot;Vissi d&#x27;arte&quot;. A lyrical andante based on Tosca&#x27;s act 1 motif, this is perhaps the opera&#x27;s best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake; he considered eliminating it since it held up the action. Fisher calls it &quot;a Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing a woman who has lived unselfishly and righteously&quot;. In the act&#x27;s finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil which follows Tosca&#x27;s stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. After Tosca&#x27;s contemptuous &quot;E avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!&quot; (&quot;All Rome trembled before him&quot;), sung on a middle C monotone (sometimes spoken), the music gradually fades, ending what Newman calls &quot;the most impressively macabre scene in all opera.&quot; The final notes in the act are those of the Scarpia motif, softly, in a minor key.

=== Act 3 ===

The third act&#x27;s tranquil beginning provides a brief respite from the drama. An introductory 16-bar theme for the horns will later be sung by Cavaradossi and Tosca in their final duet. The orchestral prelude which follows portrays the Roman dawn; the pastoral aura is accentuated by the shepherd boy&#x27;s song, and the sounds of sheep bells and church bells, the authenticity of the latter validated by Puccini&#x27;s early morning visits to Rome. Themes reminiscent of Scarpia, Tosca and Cavaradossi emerge in the music, which changes tone as the drama resumes with Cavaradossi&#x27;s entrance, to an orchestral statement of what becomes the melody of his aria &quot;E lucevan le stelle&quot;.

This is a farewell to love and life, &quot;an anguished lament and grief built around the words &#x27;muoio disperato&#x27; (I die in despair)&quot;. Puccini insisted on the inclusion of these words, and later stated that admirers of the aria had treble cause to be grateful to him: for composing the music, for having the lyrics written, and &quot;for declining expert advice to throw the result in the waste-paper basket&quot;. The lovers&#x27; final duet &quot;Amaro sol per te&quot;, which concludes with the act&#x27;s opening horn music, did not equate with Ricordi&#x27;s idea of a transcendental love duet which would be a fitting climax to the opera. Puccini justified his musical treatment by citing Tosca&#x27;s preoccupation with teaching Cavaradossi to feign death.
In the execution scene which follows, a theme emerges, the incessant repetition of which reminded Newman of the Transformation Music which separates the two parts of act 1 in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;. In the final bars, as Tosca evades Spoletta and leaps to her death, the theme of &quot;E lucevan le stelle&quot; is played &quot;tutta forze&quot; (as loudly as possible). This choice of ending has been strongly criticised by analysts, mainly because of its specific association with Cavaradossi rather than Tosca. Kerman mocked the final music, &quot;Tosca leaps, and the orchestra screams the first thing that comes into its head.&quot; Budden, however, argues that it is entirely logical to end this dark opera on its blackest theme. According to historian and former opera singer Susan Vandiver Nicassio: &quot;The conflict between the verbal and the musical clues gives the end of the opera a twist of controversy that, barring some unexpected discovery among Puccini&#x27;s papers, can never truly be resolved.&quot;

== Instrumentation ==
&quot;Tosca&quot; is scored for three flutes (the second and third doubling piccolo); two oboes; one English horn; two clarinets in B-flat; one bass clarinet in B-flat; two bassoons; one contrabassoon; four French horns in F and E; three trumpets in F; three tenor trombones; one bass trombone; a percussion section with timpani, cymbals, cannon, one triangle, one bass drum, one glockenspiel, and six church bells; one celesta, one pipe organ; one harp; and strings.

== List of arias and set numbers ==

== Recordings ==

The first complete &quot;Tosca&quot; recording was made in 1918, using the acoustic process. The conductor, Carlo Sabajno, had been the Gramophone Company&#x27;s house conductor since 1904; he had made early complete recordings of several operas, including Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; and &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, before tackling &quot;Tosca&quot; with a largely unknown cast, featuring the Italian soprano Lya Remondini in the title role. The next year, in 1919, Sabajno recorded &quot;Tosca&quot; again, this time with more well-known singers, including Valentina Bartolomasi and Attilio Salvaneschi as Tosca and Cavaradossi. Ten years later, in 1929, Sabajno returned to the opera for the third time, recording it, by the electrical process, with the orchestra and chorus of the Teatro alla Scala and with stars Carmen Melis and Apollo Granforte in the roles of Tosca and Scarpia. In 1938 HMV secured the services of the renowned tenor Beniamino Gigli, together with the soprano Maria Caniglia as Tosca and conductor Oliviero De Fabritiis, for a &quot;practically complete&quot; recording that extended over 14 double-sided shellac discs.

In the post-war period, following the invention of long-playing records, &quot;Tosca&quot; recordings were dominated by Maria Callas. In 1953, with conductor Victor de Sabata and the La Scala forces, she made the recording for EMI which for decades has been considered the best of all the recorded performances of the opera. She recorded the role again for EMI in stereo in 1964. A number of Callas&#x27;s live stage performances of &quot;Tosca&quot; were also preserved. The earliest were two performances in Mexico City, in 1950 and 1952, and the last was in London in 1965. The first stereo recording of the opera was made in 1957 by RCA Victor. Erich Leinsdorf conducted the Rome Opera House orchestra and chorus with Zinka Milanov as Tosca, Jussi Björling as Cavaradossi and Leonard Warren as Scarpia. Herbert von Karajan&#x27;s acclaimed performance with the Vienna State Opera was in 1963, with Leontyne Price, Giuseppe Di Stefano and Giuseppe Taddei in the leading roles.

The 1970s and 1980s saw a proliferation of &quot;Tosca&quot; recordings of both studio and live performances. Plácido Domingo made his first recording of Cavaradossi for RCA in 1972, and he continued to record other versions at regular intervals until 1994. In 1976, he was joined by his son, Plácido Domingo Jr., who sang the shepherd boy&#x27;s song in a filmed version with the New Philharmonia Orchestra. More recent commended recordings have included Antonio Pappano&#x27;s 2000 Royal Opera House version with Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna and Ruggero Raimondi. Recordings of &quot;Tosca&quot; in languages other than Italian are rare but not unknown; over the years versions in French, German, Spanish, Hungarian and Russian have been issued. An admired English language version was released in 1995 in which David Parry led the Philharmonia Orchestra and a largely British cast. Since the late 1990s numerous video recordings of the opera have been issued on DVD and Blu-ray disc (BD). These include recent productions and remastered versions of historic performances.

== Editions and amendments ==
The orchestral score of &quot;Tosca&quot; was published in late 1899 by Casa Ricordi. Despite some dissatisfaction expressed by Ricordi concerning the final act, the score remained relatively unchanged in the 1909 edition. An unamended edition was published by Dover Press in 1991.

The 1909 score contains a number of minor changes from the autograph score. Some are changes of phrase: Cavaradossi&#x27;s reply to the sacristan when he asks if the painter is doing penance is changed from &quot;Pranzai&quot; (&quot;I have eaten.&quot;) to &quot;Fame non ho&quot; (&quot;I am not hungry.&quot;), which William Ashbrook states, in his study of Puccini&#x27;s operas, accentuates the class distinction between the two. When Tosca comforts Cavaradossi after the torture scene, she now tells him, &quot;Ma il giusto Iddio lo punirá&quot; (&quot;But a just God will punish him&quot; [Scarpia]); formerly she stated, &quot;Ma il sozzo sbirro lo pagherà&quot; (&quot;But the filthy cop will pay for it.&quot;). Other changes are in the music; when Tosca demands the price for Cavaradossi&#x27;s freedom (&quot;Il prezzo!&quot;), her music is changed to eliminate an octave leap, allowing her more opportunity to express her contempt and loathing of Scarpia in a passage which is now near the middle of the soprano vocal range. A remnant of a &quot;Latin Hymn&quot; sung by Tosca and Cavaradossi in act 3 survived into the first published score and libretto, but is not in later versions. According to Ashbrook, the most surprising change is where, after Tosca discovers the truth about the &quot;mock&quot; execution and exclaims &quot;Finire così? Finire così?&quot; (&quot;To end like this? To end like this?&quot;), she was to sing a five-bar fragment to the melody of &quot;E lucevan le stelle&quot;. Ashbrook applauds Puccini for deleting the section from a point in the work where delay is almost unendurable as events rush to their conclusion, but points out that the orchestra&#x27;s recalling &quot;E lucevan le stelle&quot; in the final notes would seem less incongruous if it was meant to underscore Tosca&#x27;s and Cavaradossi&#x27;s love for each other, rather than being simply a melody which Tosca never hears.

<text>Madama Butterfly (; &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;) is an opera in three acts (originally two) by Giacomo Puccini, with an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa.

It is based on the short story &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; (1898) by John Luther Long, which in turn was based on stories told to Long by his sister Jennie Correll and on the semi-autobiographical 1887 French novel &quot;Madame Chrysanthème&quot; by Pierre Loti. Long&#x27;s version was dramatized by David Belasco as the one-act play &quot;Madame Butterfly: A Tragedy of Japan&quot;, which, after premiering in New York in 1900, moved to London, where Puccini saw it in the summer of that year.

The original version of the opera, in two acts, had its premiere on 17 February 1904 at La Scala in Milan. It was poorly received, despite having such notable singers as soprano Rosina Storchio, tenor Giovanni Zenatello and baritone Giuseppe De Luca in lead roles. This was due in part to a late completion by Puccini, which gave inadequate time for rehearsals. Puccini revised the opera, splitting the second act in two, with the Humming Chorus as a bridge to what became Act III, and making other changes. Success ensued, starting with the first performance on 28 May 1904 in Brescia.

== Versions ==

Puccini wrote five versions of the opera. The original two-act version, which was presented at the world premiere at La Scala on 17 February 1904, was withdrawn after the disastrous premiere. Puccini then substantially rewrote it, this time in three acts. This second version was performed on 28 May 1904 in Brescia, where it was a great success, with Solomiya Krushelnytska as Cio-Cio-san. It was this second version that premiered in the United States in 1906, first in Washington, D.C., in October, and then in New York in November, performed by Henry Savage&#x27;s New English Opera Company (so named because it performed in English-language translations).

In 1906, Puccini wrote a third version, which was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 11 February 1907. Later that year, Puccini made several changes in the orchestral and vocal scores, and this became the fourth version.

Again in 1907, Puccini made his final revisions to the opera in a fifth version, which has become known as the &quot;Standard Version&quot; and is the one which is most often performed today. However, the original 1904 version is occasionally performed, such as for the opening of La Scala&#x27;s 2016–17 season, on 7 December 2016, with Riccardo Chailly conducting.

==Performance history==
Premieres of versions of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; in major opera houses throughout the world include the Teatro de la Opera de Buenos Aires on 7 July 1904, under Arturo Toscanini, this being the first performance in the world outside Italy. As in the world premiere in Milan a few months earlier, the protagonist was Rosina Storchio. Its first performance in Britain was in London on 10 July 1905 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, while the first US performance was presented in English on 15 October 1906, in Washington, D.C., at the Columbia Theater. The first performance in New York took place on 12 November of the same year at the Garden Theatre. The Metropolitan Opera first performed the opera on 11 February 1907 under the supervision of the composer with Geraldine Farrar as Cio-Cio-San, Enrico Caruso as Pinkerton, Louise Homer as Suzuki, Antonio Scotti as Sharpless, with Arturo Vigna conducting; &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; has since been heard virtually every season at the Met except for a hiatus during World War II from 1942 through 1945 due to the hostilities between the United States and Japan. The first Australian performance was presented at the Theatre Royal in Sydney on 26 March 1910, starring Amy Eliza Castles.

Between 1915 and 1920, Japan&#x27;s best-known opera singer Tamaki Miura won international fame for her performances as Cio-Cio-San. A memorial to this singer, along with one to Puccini, can be found in the Glover Garden in the port city of Nagasaki, where the opera is set.

== Roles ==
==Synopsis==

===Act 1===
In 1904, a U.S. naval officer named Pinkerton rents a house on a hill in Nagasaki, Japan, for himself and his soon-to-be wife, &quot;Butterfly&quot;. Her real name is Cio-Cio-San (from the Japanese word for ; &quot;-san&quot; is a plain honorific). She is a 15-year-old Japanese girl whom he is marrying for convenience, and he intends to leave her once he finds a proper American wife, since Japanese divorce laws are very lenient. The wedding is to take place at the house. Butterfly had been so excited to marry an American that she had earlier secretly converted to Christianity. After the wedding ceremony, her uninvited uncle, a &quot;bonze&quot;, who has found out about her conversion, comes to the house, curses her and orders all the guests to leave, which they do while renouncing her. Pinkerton and Butterfly sing a love duet and prepare to spend their first night together.

=== Act 2 ===
Pinkerton left shortly after the wedding, and three years later, Butterfly is still waiting for him to return. Her maid Suzuki keeps trying to convince her that he is not coming back, but Butterfly does not believe her. Goro, the marriage broker who arranged her marriage, keeps trying to marry her off again, but she does not listen to him either. The American consul, Sharpless, comes to the house with a letter which he has received from Pinkerton which asks him to break some news to Butterfly: that Pinkerton is not coming back to Japan, but Sharpless cannot bring himself to finish it. Sharpless asks Butterfly what she would do if Pinkerton were not to return. She then reveals that she gave birth to Pinkerton&#x27;s son after he had left and asks Sharpless to tell him.

From the hill house, Butterfly sees Pinkerton&#x27;s ship arriving in the harbour. She and Suzuki prepare for his arrival, and then they wait. Suzuki and the child fall asleep, but Butterfly stays up all night waiting for him to arrive.

=== Act 3 ===
Suzuki wakes up in the morning and Butterfly finally falls asleep. Sharpless and Pinkerton arrive at the house, along with Pinkerton&#x27;s new American wife, Kate. They have come because Kate has agreed to raise the child. But, as Pinkerton sees how Butterfly has decorated the house for his return, he realizes he has made a huge mistake. He admits that he is a coward and cannot face her, leaving Suzuki, Sharpless, and Kate to break the news to Butterfly. Agreeing to give up her child if Pinkerton comes himself to see her, Butterfly prays to statues of her ancestral gods, says goodbye to her son, and blindfolds him. She places a small American flag in his hands and goes behind a screen, stabbing herself with her father&#x27;s seppukuknife. Pinkerton rushes in, but he is too late, and Butterfly dies.

== Reception ==
The premiere in Milan was a fiasco, as Puccini&#x27;s sister, Ramelde, wrote in a letter to her husband:

Called &quot;one of the most terrible flops in Italian opera history&quot;, the premiere was beset by several bad staging decisions, including the lack of an intermission during the second act. Worst of all was the idea to give audience plants nightingale whistles to deepen the sense of sunrise in the final scene. The audience took the noise as a cue to make their own animal noises.

&quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; has been criticized by some American individuals for orientalism. Despite these opinions, &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; has been successfully performed in Japan in various adaptions from 1914. 

Today &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; is the sixth most performed opera in the world and considered a masterpiece, with Puccini&#x27;s orchestration praised as limpid, fluent and refined.

<text>A wind tunnel is &quot;an apparatus for producing a controlled stream of air for conducting aerodynamic experiments&quot;. The experiment is conducted in the test section of the wind tunnel and a complete tunnel configuration includes air ducting to and from the test section and a device for keeping the air in motion, such as a fan. Wind tunnel uses include assessing the effects of air on an aircraft in flight or a ground vehicle moving on land, and measuring the effect of wind on buildings and bridges. Wind tunnel test sections range in size from less than a foot across, to over , and with air speeds from a light breeze to hypersonic.

The earliest wind tunnels were invented towards the end of the 19th century, in the early days of aeronautical research, as part of the effort to develop heavier-than-air flying machines. The wind tunnel reversed the usual situation. Instead of the air standing still and an aircraft moving, an object would be held still and the air moved around it. In this way, a stationary observer could study the flying object in action, and could measure the aerodynamic forces acting on it.

The development of wind tunnels accompanied the development of the airplane. Large wind tunnels were built during World War II, and as supersonic aircraft were developed, supersonic wind tunnels were constructed to test them. Wind tunnel testing was considered of strategic importance during the Cold War for development of aircraft and missiles.

Advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have reduced the demand for wind tunnel testing, but have not completely eliminated it. Many real-world problems can still not be modeled accurately enough by CFD to eliminate the need for wind tunnel testing. Moreover, confidence in a numerical simulation tool depends on comparing its results with experimental data, and these can be obtained, for example, from wind tunnel tests.

==How it works==
A wind tunnel creates an outdoor environment in a controlled indoor setting which enables measurements of wind forces on a moving object to be taken while the object is stationary. This is much cheaper and more convenient than getting measurements while the object is moving.

The object being tested, such as a scale model of an aircraft, is placed in the test section and restrained from moving. Air is flowed around the object and the forces on the model are measured. The measurements taken from the reduced-scale model are applicable to the full-size aircraft. Testing of scale models of a new aircraft design before it flies is done to ensure the first flight will be safe with the aircraft behaving in a predictable manner. Research in wind tunnels produces accurate results and is done rapidly and economically compared to flight testing of full-scale aircraft.

Few people see a wind tunnel or are aware of their existence but work done in their test sections affects every-day life. For example, streamlining investigates ways to reduce the air drag on airliners, cars, and racing cyclists. The requirement for streamlining is not always the same, for airliners and cars it is to reduce fuel consumption, for racing cyclists it is to increase speed.

Car fuel consumption is of secondary importance to drivers when starting and driving in extreme cold and wind-driven snow. This condition is investigated in a different kind of wind tunnel, the climatic wind tunnel. The test section subjects cars to a range of extreme environmental conditions to make sure the air conditioning can make the car comfortable on very hot and very cold days and can keep windows clear of condensation in very humid and cool weather.

==History==

===Origins===

English military engineer and mathematician Benjamin Robins (1707–1751) invented a whirling arm apparatus to determine drag and did some of the first experiments in aerodynamics.

Sir George Cayley (1773–1857) also used a whirling arm to measure the drag and lift of various airfoils. His whirling arm was long and attained speeds between 10 and 20 feet per second (3 to 6 m/s).

Otto Lilienthal used a rotating arm to make measurements on wing airfoils with varying angles of attack, establishing their lift-to-drag ratio polar diagrams, but was lacking the notions of induced drag and Reynolds numbers.

Drawbacks of whirling arm tests are that they do not produce a reliable flow of air. Centrifugal forces and the fact that the object is moving in its own wake also mean that detailed examination of the airflow is difficult. Francis Herbert Wenham (1824–1908), a Council Member of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, addressed these issues by inventing, designing, and operating the first enclosed wind tunnel in 1871. Once this breakthrough had been achieved, detailed technical data was rapidly extracted by the use of this tool. Wenham and his colleague John Browning are credited with many fundamental discoveries, including the measurement of l/d ratios, and the revelation of the beneficial effects of a high aspect ratio.

Konstantin Tsiolkovsky built an open-section wind tunnel with a centrifugal blower in 1897, and determined the drag coefficients of flat plates, cylinders, and spheres.

Danish inventor Poul la Cour used wind tunnels to develop wind turbines in the early 1890s.
Carl Rickard Nyberg used a wind tunnel to design his &quot;Flugan&quot; starting in 1897.

The Englishman Osborne Reynolds (1842–1912) of the University of Manchester demonstrated that the airflow pattern over a scale model would be the same for the full-scale vehicle if a certain flow parameter were the same in both cases. This parameter, now known as the Reynolds number, is used in the description of all fluid-flow situations, including the shape of flow patterns, the effectiveness of heat transfers, and the onset of turbulence. This comprises the central scientific justification for the use of models in wind tunnels to simulate real-life phenomena.

The Wright brothers&#x27; use of a simple wind tunnel in 1901 to study the effects of airflow over various shapes while developing their Wright Flyer was in some ways revolutionary. However, they were using the accepted technology of the day, though this was not yet a common technology in America.

In France, Gustave Eiffel (1832–1923) built his first open-return wind tunnel in 1909, powered by a electric motor, at Champs-de-Mars, near the foot of the tower that bears his name.

Between 1909 and 1912 Eiffel ran about 4,000 tests in his wind tunnel, and his systematic experimentation set new standards for aeronautical research.
In 1912 Eiffel&#x27;s laboratory was moved to Auteuil, a suburb of Paris, where his wind tunnel with a test section is still operational today. Eiffel significantly improved the efficiency of the open-return wind tunnel by enclosing the test section in a chamber, designing a flared inlet with a honeycomb flow straightener, and adding a diffuser between the test section and the fan located at the downstream end of the diffuser; this was an arrangement followed by a number of wind tunnels later built; in fact the open-return low-speed wind tunnel is often called the Eiffel-type wind tunnel.

=== Widespread usage ===
Subsequent use of wind tunnels proliferated as the science of aerodynamics and discipline of aeronautical engineering were established and air travel and power were developed.

The US Navy in 1916 built one of the largest wind tunnels in the world at that time at the Washington Navy Yard. The inlet was almost in diameter and the discharge part was in diameter. A electric motor drove the paddle type fan blades.

In 1931 the NACA built a full-scale wind tunnel at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The tunnel was powered by a pair of fans driven by electric motors. The layout was a double-return, closed-loop format and could accommodate many full-size real aircraft as well as scale models. The tunnel was eventually closed and, even though it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1995, demolition began in 2010.

Until World War II, the world&#x27;s largest wind tunnel, built in 1932–1934, was located in a suburb of Paris, Chalais-Meudon, France. It was designed to test full-size aircraft and had six large fans driven by high powered electric motors. The Chalais-Meudon wind tunnel was used by ONERA under the name S1Ch until 1976 in the development of, e.g., the Caravelle and Concorde airplanes. Today, this wind tunnel is preserved as a national monument.

Ludwig Prandtl was Theodore von Kármán&#x27;s teacher at Göttingen University and suggested the construction of a wind tunnel for tests of airships they were designing. The vortex street of turbulence downstream of a cylinder was tested in the tunnel. When he later moved to Aachen University he recalled use of this facility:

I remembered the wind tunnel in Göttingen was started as a tool for studies of Zeppelin behavior, but that it had proven to be valuable for everything else from determining the direction of smoke from a ship&#x27;s stack, to whether a given airplane would fly. Progress at Aachen, I felt, would be virtually impossible without a good wind tunnel.

When von Kármán began to consult with Caltech he worked with Clark Millikan and Arthur L. Klein. He objected to their design and insisted on a return flow making the device &quot;independent of the fluctuations of the outside atmosphere&quot;. It was completed in 1930 and used for Northrop Alpha testing.

In 1939 General Arnold asked what was required to advance the USAF, and von Kármán answered, &quot;The first step is to build the right wind tunnel.&quot; On the other hand, after the successes of the Bell X-2 and prospect of more advanced research, he wrote, &quot;I was in favor of constructing such a plane because I have never believed that you can get all the answers out of a wind tunnel.&quot;

===World War II===
In 1941 the US constructed one of the largest wind tunnels at that time at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. This wind tunnel starts at and narrows to in diameter. Two fans were driven by a electric motor. Large scale aircraft models could be tested at air speeds of .

During WWII, Germany developed different designs of large wind tunnels to further their knowledge of aeronautics. For example, the wind tunnel at Peenemünde was a novel wind tunnel design that allowed for high-speed airflow research, but brought several design challenges regarding constructing a high-speed wind tunnel at scale. However, it successfully used some large natural caves which were increased in size by excavation and then sealed to store large volumes of air which could then be routed through the wind tunnels. By the end of the war, Germany had at least three different supersonic wind tunnels, with one capable of Mach 4.4 heated airflows.

A large wind tunnel under construction near Oetztal, Austria would have had two fans directly driven by two hydraulic turbines. The installation was not completed by the end of the war and the dismantled equipment was shipped to Modane, France in 1946 where it was re-erected and is still operated there by the ONERA. With its test section and airspeed up to Mach 1, it is the largest transonic wind tunnel facility in the world. Frank Wattendorf reported on this wind tunnel for a US response.

On 22 June 1942, Curtiss-Wright financed construction of one of the nation&#x27;s largest subsonic wind tunnels in Buffalo, New York. The first concrete for building was poured on 22 June 1942 on a site that eventually would become Calspan, where the wind tunnel still operates.

By the end of World War II, the US had built eight new wind tunnels, including the largest one in the world at Moffett Field near Sunnyvale, California, which was designed to test full size aircraft at speeds of less than and a vertical wind tunnel at Wright Field, Ohio, where the wind stream is upwards for the testing of models in spin situations and the concepts and engineering designs for the first primitive helicopters flown in the US.

===After World War II===

Later research into airflows near or above the speed of sound used a related approach. Metal pressure chambers were used to store high-pressure air which was then accelerated through a nozzle designed to provide supersonic flow. The observation or instrumentation chamber (&quot;test section&quot;) was then placed at the proper location in the throat or nozzle for the desired airspeed.

In the United States, concern over the lagging of American research facilities compared to those built by the Germans led to the Unitary Wind Tunnel Plan Act of 1949, which authorized expenditure to construct new wind tunnels at universities and at government sites. Some German war-time wind tunnels were dismantled for shipment to the United States as part of the plan to exploit German technology developments.

In the United States, many wind tunnels have been decommissioned from 1990 to 2010, including some historic facilities. Pressure is brought to bear on remaining wind tunnels due to declining or erratic usage, high electricity costs, and in some cases the high value of the real estate upon which the facility sits. On the other hand, CFD validation still requires wind-tunnel data, and this is likely to be the case for the foreseeable future. Studies have been done and others are underway to assess future military and commercial wind tunnel needs, but the outcome remains uncertain. More recently an increasing use of jet-powered, instrumented unmanned vehicles, or research drones, have replaced some of the traditional uses of wind tunnels. The world&#x27;s fastest wind tunnel as of 2019 is the LENS-X wind tunnel, located in Buffalo, New York.

==Measurement of aerodynamic forces and moments==

Air speed, direction and pressures are measured in several ways in wind tunnels.

Air speed through the test section is determined by Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. The direction of airflow around a model is shown by fluttering tufts of yarn attached to the aerodynamic surfaces. The direction of airflow approaching and leaving a surface can be seen by mounting tufts in the airflow in front of and behind the model. Smoke or bubbles of liquid can be introduced into the airflow upstream of the model, and their paths around the model recorded using photography (see particle image velocimetry).

Aerodynamic forces on the test model are measured with beam balances.

The pressure distribution on a test model has historically been measured by drilling small holes on the surface, and connecting them to manometers to measure the pressure at each hole. Pressure distributions can be measured more conveniently using pressure-sensitive paint, in which pressure is indicated by the fluorescence of the paint. They can also be measured with very small electronic pressure sensors mounted on a flexible strip which is attached to the model.

The aerodynamic properties of an object can vary for a scaled model. However, by observing certain similarity rules, a very satisfactory correspondence between the aerodynamic properties of a scaled model and a full-size object can be achieved. The choice of similarity parameters depends on the purpose of the test, but the most important conditions to satisfy are usually:

* Geometric similarity: all dimensions of the object must be proportionally scaled.
* Mach number: the ratio of the airspeed to the speed of sound should be identical for the scaled model and the actual object (having identical Mach number in a wind tunnel and around the actual object is not equal to having identical airspeeds).
* Reynolds number: the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces should be kept. This parameter is difficult to satisfy with a scaled model and has led to development of pressurized and cryogenic wind tunnels in which the viscosity of the working fluid can be greatly changed to compensate for the reduced scale of the model.

In certain particular test cases, other similarity parameters must be satisfied, such as the Froude number.

===Force and moment measurements===
The model is mounted on a balance which measures forces and moments. Lift, drag, and lateral forces, as well as yaw, roll, and pitching moments are measured over a range of angle of attack. Common curves such as lift coefficient versus angle of attack are produced.

The model must be held stationary, and these external supports create drag and potential turbulence that will affect the measurements. The supporting structures are kept as small as possible and aerodynamically shaped to minimize turbulence.

==Flow visualization==
Because air is transparent, it is difficult to directly observe the air movement itself. Instead, multiple methods of both quantitative and qualitative flow visualization methods have been developed for testing in a wind tunnel.

===Qualitative methods===

* Smoke
* Carbon dioxide injection
* Tufts, mini-tufts, or flow cones can be applied to a model and remain attached during testing. Tufts can be used to gauge air flow patterns and flow separation. Tufts are sometimes made of fluorescent material and are illuminated under black light to aid in visualization. Tufts are also used on aircraft in flight. During flight-testing of the experimental rocket plane SpaceShipOne tufts were attached to the surface of the wings. No wind tunnel testing was done on the aircraft.
*Evaporating suspensions are simply a mixture of some sort or fine powder, talc, or clay mixed into a liquid with a low latent heat of evaporation. When the wind is turned on the liquid quickly evaporates, leaving behind the clay in a pattern characteristic of the air flow.
* Oil: When oil is applied to the model surface it can clearly show the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as well as flow separation.
* Tempera paint: Similar to oil, it can be applied to the surface of the model by initially applying the paint in spaced out dots. After running the wind tunnel, the flow direction and separation can be identified. An additional strategy in the use of tempera paint is to use blacklights to create a luminous flow pattern with the tempera paint.
* Fog (usually from water particles) is created with an ultrasonic piezoelectric nebulizer. The fog is transported inside the wind tunnel (preferably of the closed circuit and closed test section type). An electrically heated grid is inserted before the test section, which evaporates the water particles at its vicinity, thus forming fog sheets. The fog sheets function as streamlines over the test model when illuminated by a light sheet.
* Sublimation: If the air movement in the tunnel is sufficiently non-turbulent, a particle stream released into the airflow will not break up as the air moves along, but stay together as a sharp thin line. Multiple particle streams released from a grid of many nozzles can provide a dynamic three-dimensional shape of the airflow around a body. As with the force balance, these injection pipes and nozzles need to be shaped in a manner that minimizes the introduction of turbulent airflow into the airstream.
* Sublimation (alternate definition): A flow visualization technique is to coat the model in a sublimatable material where once the wind is turned on in regions where the airflow is laminar, the material will remain attached to the model, while conversely in turbulent areas the material will evaporate off of the model. This technique is primarily employed to verify that trip dots placed at the leading edge in order to force a transition are successfully achieving the intended goal.

High-speed turbulence and vortices can be difficult to see directly, but strobe lights and film cameras or high-speed digital cameras can help to capture events that are a blur to the naked eye.

High-speed cameras are also required when the subject of the test is itself moving at high speed, such as an airplane propeller. The camera can capture stop-motion images of how the blade cuts through the particulate streams and how vortices are generated along the trailing edges of the moving blade.

===Quantitative methods===
* Pressure-sensitive paint (PSP): the air pressure on a surface is measured with paint coatings which reacts to variations in pressure by changing color.
* Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and laser Doppler velocimetry: air velocity is measured with lasers.
* Model Deformation Measurement (MDM): measures how much a model bends and twists.

==Classification==
There are many different kinds of wind tunnels. They are typically classified by the range of speeds that are achieved in the test section, as follows:

* Low-speed wind tunnel
* Subsonic and transonic wind tunnel
* Supersonic wind tunnel
* Hypersonic wind tunnel
* High enthalpy wind tunnel

Wind tunnels are also classified by the orientation of air flow in the test section with respect to gravity. Typically they are oriented horizontally, as happens during level flight. A different class of wind tunnels are oriented vertically so that gravity can be balanced by drag instead of lift, and these have become a popular form of recreation for simulating sky-diving:

* Vertical wind tunnel
Wind tunnels are also classified based on their main use. For those used with land vehicles such as cars and trucks the type of floor aerodynamics is also important. These vary from stationary floors through to full moving floors, with smaller moving floors and some attempt at boundary level control also being important.

===Aeronautical wind tunnels===
The main subcategories in the aeronautical wind tunnels are:

====High Reynolds number tunnels====
Reynolds number is one of the governing similarity parameters for the simulation of flow in a wind tunnel. For mach number less than 0.3, it is the primary parameter that governs the flow characteristics. There are three main ways to simulate high Reynolds number, since it is not practical to obtain full scale Reynolds number by use of a full scale vehicle.
* Pressurised tunnels: Test gases are pressurised to increase the Reynolds number.
* Heavy gas tunnels: Heavier gases like freon and R-134a are used as test gases. The transonic dynamics tunnel at NASA Langley is an example of such a tunnel.
* Cryogenic tunnels: Test gas is cooled down to increase the Reynolds number. The European transonic wind tunnel uses this technique.
* High-altitude tunnels: These are designed to test the effects of shock waves against various aircraft shapes in near vacuum. In 1952 the University of California constructed the first two high-altitude wind tunnels: one for testing objects at above the earth and the second for tests at above the earth.

====V/STOL tunnels====
V/STOL tunnels require large cross section area, but only small velocities. Since power varies with the cube of velocity, the power required for the operation is also less. An example of a V/STOL tunnel is the NASA Langley tunnel.

====Tunnels with vertical airflow====
Vertical wind tunnels have a test section with air flowing upwards. Photography is used to record free-flight spin characteristics of aircraft models. Nets are installed above and below the test section to prevent the model from moving too high and to catch it when the air stops flowing.

===Automotive tunnels===
Automotive wind tunnels fall into two categories:
* those which are used to determine the aerodynamic coefficients of the vehicle,
* climatic tunnels that evaluate vehicle operability under a wide range of simulated environmental conditions including extreme cold, snow, solar loading and humidity.

Wind tunnel testing of automobiles began in the 1920s, on cars such as the Rumpler Tropfenwagen, and the Chrysler Airflow. Initially, scale models were tested, then larger wind tunnels were built to test full-scale cars with the capability to measure aerodynamic drag which enables improvements to be made for reducing fuel consumption. Wunibald Kamm built the first full-scale wind tunnel for motor vehicles.

===Low speed tunnels===
Wind tunnels have been used to test sporting equipment including golf clubs, golf balls, bobsleds, cyclists, and race car helmets. Helmet aerodynamics are particularly important in open cockpit race cars such as Indycar and Formula One. Aerodynamic forces on the helmet at high speeds can cause considerable neck strain on the driver; and flow separation on the back side of the helmet can cause turbulent buffeting and thus blurred vision for the driver.

Other problems are also studied with wind tunnels. The effects of wind on man-made structures need to be studied when buildings became tall enough to be significantly affected by the wind. Very tall buildings present large surfaces to the wind, and the resulting forces have to be resisted by the building&#x27;s internal structure or else the building will collapse. Determining such forces was required before building codes could specify the required strength of such buildings and these tests continue to be used for large or unusual buildings.

===Aeroacoustic tunnels===
These tunnels are used in the studies of noise generated by flow and its suppression.

===High enthalpy===
A high enthalpy wind tunnel is intended to study flow of air around objects moving at speeds much faster than the local speed of sound (hypersonic speeds). &quot;Enthalpy&quot; is the total energy of a gas stream, composed of internal energy due to temperature, the product of pressure and volume, and the velocity of flow. Duplication of the conditions of hypersonic flight requires large volumes of high-pressure, heated air; large pressurized hot reservoirs, and electric arcs, are two techniques used.

===Aquadynamic flume===
The aerodynamic principles of the wind tunnel work equally on watercraft, except the water is more viscous and so sets greater forces on the object being tested. A looping flume is typically used for underwater aquadynamic testing. The interaction between two different types of fluids means that pure wind tunnel testing is only partly relevant. However, a similar sort of research is done in a towing tank.

===Low-speed oversize liquid testing===
Air is not always the best test medium for studying small-scale aerodynamic principles, due to the speed of the air flow and airfoil movement. A study of fruit fly wings designed to understand how the wings produce lift was performed using a large tank of mineral oil and wings 100 times larger than actual size, in order to slow down the wing beats and make the vortices generated by the insect wings easier to see and understand.

===Environmental wind tunnels===

Wind tunnel tests are used to determine wind velocities around buildings and bridges, and the wind forces on them.

Environmental wind tunnels are used to simulate the boundary layer of the atmosphere in windy conditions near the earth&#x27;s surface. The wind near the ground is highly turbulent. Whereas vehicle wind tunnels have features to produce steady, straight-line air approaching the test model environmental tunnels need spires followed by small cubes on the floor to make the air represent the atmosphere boundary layer as it approaches the test object. The forces caused by wind on high-rise buildings and bridges have to be understood so they can be built using a minimum of construction materials while still being safe in very high winds. Another significant application for boundary layer wind tunnel modeling is for understanding exhaust gas dispersion patterns for hospitals, laboratories, and other emitting sources. Other examples of boundary layer wind tunnel applications are assessments of pedestrian comfort and snow drifting. Wind tunnel modeling is accepted as a method for aiding in green building design. For instance, the use of boundary layer wind tunnel modeling can be used as a credit for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification through the US Green Building Council.

<doc id="38248" wikidata="Q207990" url="?curid=38248" title="Turandot">
<text>Turandot ( ; ) is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to a libretto in Italian by Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. Puccini left the opera unfinished at the time of his death in 1924; it premiered in 1926 after the music was posthumously completed by Franco Alfano.

The opera is set in China and follows the Prince Calaf, who falls in love with the cold Princess Turandot. In order to win her hand in marriage, a suitor must solve three riddles, with a wrong answer resulting in his execution. Calaf passes the test, but Turandot refuses to marry him. He offers her a way out: if she is able to guess his name before dawn the next day, he will accept death.

==Origin and pronunciation of the name==

The title of the opera is derived from the Persian term &quot;Turandokht&quot; (, &#x27;daughter of Turan&#x27;), a name frequently given to Central Asian princesses in Persian poetry. Turan is a region of Central Asia that was once part of the Persian Empire. It also applies to the Mongols who were emperors of China during the Yuan dynasty. &quot;Dokht&quot; is a contraction of &quot;dokhtar&quot; (daughter); the &quot;kh&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are both pronounced.

Italian pronunciation dictionaries recommend pronouncing the final &quot;t&quot;. However, according to Puccini scholar Patrick Vincent Casali, the &quot;t&quot; is silent in the name of the opera and of its title character. Soprano Rosa Raisa, who created the title role, said that neither Puccini nor Arturo Toscanini, who conducted the first performances, ever pronounced the final &quot;t&quot;. Similarly, prominent Turandot Eva Turner did not pronounce the final &quot;t&quot; in television interviews. Casali maintains that the musical setting of many of Calaf&#x27;s utterances of the name makes sounding the final &quot;t&quot; all but impossible.

==Composition history==
The beginnings of &quot;Turandot&quot; can likely be found in &quot;Haft Peykar&quot;, a twelfth-century epic by the Persian poet Nizami. One of the stories in &quot;Haft Peykar&quot; features a Russian princess. In 1722, François Pétis de la Croix published his &quot;Les Mille et un jours&quot; (The Thousand and One Days), a collection of stories which were purportedly taken from Middle Eastern folklore and mythologies. One of these stories, believed to be inspired by Nizami, features a cold princess named Turandokht. However, it has been speculated that many of de la Croix&#x27;s &#x27;translated&#x27; stories were his own original creations, with no actual basis in Middle Eastern cultures. De la Croix&#x27;s story was adapted into a play, &quot;Turandot&quot;, by the Italian playwright Carlo Gozzi in 1762, which was then adapted by Friedrich Schiller into another play in 1801. It was Schiller&#x27;s version that inspired Puccini to write the opera.
Puccini began working on &quot;Turandot&quot; in March 1920 after meeting with librettists Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. In his impatience, he began composition in January 1921, before Adami and Simoni had produced the text for the libretto. As with &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, Puccini strove for a semblance of authenticity by using music from the region, even commissioning a set of thirteen custom-made gongs. Baron Edoardo Fassini-Camossi, the former Italian diplomat to China, gave Puccini a music box that played 4 Chinese melodies. Puccini incorporated three of these melodies into his opera, the most memorable of which is the folk melody &quot;Mò Li Hūa (茉莉花)&quot; (&#x27;Jasmine Flower&#x27;). &quot;Mò Li Hūa&quot; serves as a leitmotif for Princess Turandot&#x27;s splendor. In total, eight of the themes from &quot;Turandot&quot; appear to be based on traditional Chinese music and anthems.

By March 1924, Puccini had completed the opera up to the final duet. However, he was dissatisfied with the text of the final duet, and did not continue until 8 October, when he chose Adami&#x27;s fourth version of the duet text. Two days later, he was diagnosed with throat cancer. Puccini seems to have had some inkling of the seriousness of his condition: before leaving for Brussels for treatment, he visited Arturo Toscanini and begged him, &quot;Don&#x27;t let my Turandot die.&quot; He died of a heart attack on 29 November 1924.

===Completion of the score after Puccini&#x27;s death===
When Puccini died, the first two of the three acts were fully composed, including the orchestration. Puccini had composed and fully orchestrated Act Three up until Liù&#x27;s death and funeral cortege. In the sense of finished music, this was the last music composed by Puccini. He left behind 36 pages of sketches on 23 sheets for the end of &quot;Turandot&quot;. Some sketches were in the form of &quot;piano-vocal&quot; or &quot;short score&quot;, including vocal lines with &quot;two to four staves of accompaniment with occasional notes on orchestration.&quot; These sketches provided music for some, but not all, of the final portion of the libretto.

Puccini left instructions that Riccardo Zandonai should finish the opera. Puccini&#x27;s son Tonio objected, and eventually Franco Alfano was chosen to flesh out the sketches after Vincenzo Tommasini (who had completed Boito&#x27;s &quot;Nerone&quot; after the composer&#x27;s death) and Pietro Mascagni were rejected. Puccini&#x27;s publisher Tito Ricordi II decided on Alfano because his opera &quot;La leggenda di Sakùntala&quot; resembled &quot;Turandot&quot; in its setting and heavy orchestration. Alfano provided a first version of the ending with a few passages of his own, and even a few sentences added to the libretto, which was not considered complete even by Puccini. After the severe criticisms by Ricordi and the conductor Arturo Toscanini, he was forced to write a second, strictly censored version that followed Puccini&#x27;s sketches more closely, to the point where he did not set some of Adami&#x27;s text to music because Puccini had not indicated how he wanted it to sound. Ricordi&#x27;s real concern was not the quality of Alfano&#x27;s work; he wanted the end of &quot;Turandot&quot; to sound as if it had been written by Puccini. Of this version, about three minutes were cut for performance by Toscanini, and it is this shortened version that is usually performed today.

==Performance history==

&quot;Turandot&quot; premiered at the La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, on 25 April 1926, a year and five months after Puccini&#x27;s death. Rosa Raisa played Turandot. Tenors Miguel Fleta and Franco Lo Giudice alternated in the role of Prince Calaf, with Fleta singing the role on opening night. It was conducted by Arturo Toscanini. In the middle of Act III, the orchestra stopped playing. Toscanini turned to the audience and announced, &quot;Qui finisce l&#x27;opera, perché a questo punto il maestro è morto&quot; (&quot;Here the opera ends, because at this point the maestro died&quot;). The curtain was then lowered. A reporter for &quot;La Stampa&quot; recorded the words slightly differently: &quot;Qui finisce l&#x27;opera, rimasta incompiuta per la morte del povero Puccini&quot; (&quot;Here the opera ends, left incomplete by the death of the poor Puccini&quot;). Others have reported that Toscanini said &quot;Here, the Maestro laid down his pen.&quot; A newspaper report from 1926 states that Puccini asked Toscanini to stop the opera performance in the middle of Act III. The second and subsequent performances of the 1926 La Scala season included Alfano&#x27;s ending.

Soon after its premiere in Milan, &quot;Turandot&quot; spread to other cities.

For many years, the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China forbade performance of &quot;Turandot&quot; because they said it portrayed China and the Chinese unfavorably. Instead of a single nationwide decree against it, any attempts to produce it were not approved. In the late 1990s they relented, and in September 1998 the opera was performed for eight nights as &quot;Turandot at the Forbidden City&quot;, complete with opulent sets and soldiers from the People&#x27;s Liberation Army as extras. It was an international collaboration, with director Zhang Yimou as choreographer and Zubin Mehta as conductor. The singing roles saw Giovanna Casolla, Audrey Stottler, and Sharon Sweet as Princess Turandot; Sergej Larin and Lando Bartolini as Calaf; and Barbara Frittoli, Cristina Gallardo-Domâs, and Barbara Hendricks as Liù.

The aria &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; has long been a staple of operatic recitals. Luciano Pavarotti popularized the piece beyond the opera world in the 1990s with his performance of it for the 1990 World Cup, which received a global audience. Both Pavarotti and Plácido Domingo released singles of the aria, with Pavarotti&#x27;s reaching number 2 in the UK. The Three Tenors performed the aria at three subsequent World Cup Finals, in 1994 in Los Angeles, 1998 in Paris, and 2002 in Yokohama. Many crossover and pop artists have performed and recorded it and the aria has been used in the soundtracks of numerous films. &quot;Turandot&quot; is a staple of the standard operatic repertoire and it appears as number 17 on the Operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide.

===Alfano&#x27;s and other versions===
The debate over which version of the ending is better is still open. Alfano&#x27;s original ending to the opera was first recorded (as part of an album with Josephine Barstow singing final scenes of several operas) by John Mauceri and Scottish Opera (with Josephine Barstow and Lando Bartolini as soloists) for Decca Records in 1990 to great acclaim. However, it may have been staged in Germany in the early years, since Ricordi had commissioned a German translation of the text and a number of scores were printed in Germany with the full final scene included. Alfano&#x27;s second ending has been further redacted as well: Turandot&#x27;s aria &quot;Del primo pianto&quot; was performed at the premiere but cut from the first complete recording; it was eventually restored to most performances of the opera.

From 1976 to 1988, the American composer Janet Maguire, convinced that the whole ending is coded in the sketches left by Puccini, composed a new ending, but this has never been performed. In 2001, Luciano Berio made a new completion sanctioned by Casa Ricordi and the Puccini estate, using Puccini&#x27;s sketches but also expanding the musical language. It was subsequently performed in the Canary Islands and Amsterdam conducted by Riccardo Chailly, Los Angeles conducted by Kent Nagano, at the Salzburg Festival conducted by Valery Gergiev in August 2002. However, its reception was mixed.

In late 2007, Chinese composer Hao Weiya made another completion before the opening of National Centre for the Performing Arts, also resulting in a mixed reception.

In 2022, Deborah Burton &quot;realized&quot; a finale to Turandot that utilized several of Puccini&#x27;s autograph sketches that had not been previously studied. Based on decades of analyzing Puccini&#x27;s compositional style, her finale has not yet been produced, although some possible venues are in the offing. A description of her finale can be found in her article, &quot;Puccini&#x27;s Last Act: Finishing &quot;Turandot&quot;&quot; (The Opera Journal, Vol. 55, No. 2, pp. 1–60) and in her book &quot;The Finales of Turandot: Puccini&#x27;s Last Act&quot; (Routledge, 2025).

In 2024, Washington National Opera premiered a newly commissioned ending by composer Christopher Tin and librettist Susan Soon He Stanton to very positive reviews. Michael Andor Brodeur of The Washington Post called the production &#x27;refreshing&#x27; and declared &quot;Even without the new ending — and Tin’s splendid musical additions, which draw sensibly from Puccini’s score while applying an entirely new emotional finish — Francesca Zambello’s &quot;Turandot&quot; crackles with fresh energy&quot;. Heidi Waleson of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the new ending &quot;fits the opera neatly. Its sound and attitude, while contemporary, grow organically from Puccini’s original, like a savvy modern addition on a historic building.&quot;

In 2024, Opera Delaware premiered a newly commissioned completion by composer Derrick Wang, which was praised as &quot;adept,&quot; &quot;respectful,&quot; and &quot;seamless.&quot;

Daniela Kerck made another version for the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden in 2024, using exclusively music by Puccini, the unfinished opera followed by his 1905 &quot;Requiem&quot; antiphone. She identified Calaf with Puccini, and other characters with people from his life, beginning and ending the story in Puccini&#x27;s library with a grand piano. In this version, when Liú has taken her life and the music by Puccini ends, the Puccini on stage receives a kiss of death from Turandot and dies.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
:Place: Peking, China
:Time: Legendary times

===Act 1===

&quot;In front of the imperial palace&quot;

In China, the beautiful Princess Turandot will marry only a suitor who can answer three riddles. A Mandarin announces the law of the land (Aria – &quot;Popolo di Pechino!&quot; – &quot;People of Peking!&quot;). The Prince of Persia has failed to answer the three riddles, and he is to be beheaded at the next rising moon. As the crowd surges towards the gates of the palace, the imperial guards brutally repulse them, causing a blind old man to be knocked to the ground. The old man&#x27;s slave-girl, Liù, cries out for help. A young man hears her cry and recognizes that the old man is his long-lost father, Timur, the deposed king of Tartary. The young Prince of Tartary is overjoyed at seeing Timur alive, but still urges Timur not to speak his name because he is afraid that the Chinese rulers, who have conquered Tartary, may kill or harm them. Timur then tells his son that, of all his servants, only Liù has remained faithful to him. When the Prince asks her why, she tells him that once, long ago in the palace, the Prince had smiled at her (Trio with chorus – The crowd, Liù, Prince of Tartary, Timur: &quot;Indietro, cani!&quot; – &quot;Back, dogs!&quot;).

The moon rises, and the crowd&#x27;s cries for blood dissolve into silence. The doomed Prince of Persia, who is on his way to be executed, is led before the crowd. The young Prince is so handsome and kind that the crowd and the Prince of Tartary decide that they want Turandot to act compassionately, and they beg Turandot to appear and spare his life (Aria – The crowd, Prince of Tartary: &quot;O giovinetto!&quot; – &quot;O youth!&quot;). She then appears, and with a single imperious gesture, orders the execution to continue. The Prince of Tartary, who has never seen Turandot before, falls immediately in love with her, and joyfully cries out Turandot&#x27;s name three times, foreshadowing the riddles to come. Then the Prince of Persia cries out Turandot&#x27;s name one final time, mirroring the Prince of Tartary. The crowd, horrified, screams out one final time and the Prince of Persia is beheaded.
The Prince of Tartary is dazzled by Turandot&#x27;s beauty. He is about to rush towards the gong and to strike it three times – the symbolic gesture of whoever wishes to attempt to solve the riddles so that he can marry Turandot – when the ministers Ping, Pang, and Pong appear. They urge him cynically not to lose his head for Turandot and instead to go back to his own country (&quot;Fermo, che fai?&quot; &quot;Stop, what are you doing?&quot;). Timur urges his son to desist, and Liù, who is secretly in love with the Prince, pleads with him not to attempt to solve the riddles (&quot;Signore, ascolta!&quot; – &quot;Lord, hear!&quot;). Liù&#x27;s words touch the Prince&#x27;s heart. He begs Liù to make Timur&#x27;s exile more bearable by not abandoning Timur if the Prince fails to answer the riddles (&quot;Non piangere, Liù&quot; – &quot;Do not cry, Liù&quot;). The three ministers, Timur, and Liù then try one last time to stop the Prince (&quot;Ah! Per l&#x27;ultima volta!&quot; – &quot;Ah! For the last time!&quot;) from attempting to answer the riddles, but he refuses to heed their advice.

He calls Turandot&#x27;s name three times, and each time Liù, Timur, and the ministers reply, &quot;Death!&quot; and the crowd declares, &quot;We&#x27;re already digging your grave!&quot; Rushing to the gong that hangs in front of the palace, the Prince strikes it three times, declaring himself to be a suitor. From the palace balcony, Turandot accepts his challenge, as Ping, Pang, and Pong laugh at the Prince&#x27;s foolishness.

===Act 2===

&quot;Scene 1: A pavilion in the imperial palace. Before sunrise&quot;

Ping, Pang, and Pong lament their place as ministers, poring over palace documents and presiding over endless rituals. They prepare themselves for either a wedding or a funeral (Trio – Ping, Pang, Pong: &quot;Ola, Pang!&quot;). Ping suddenly longs for his country house in Honan, with its small lake surrounded by bamboo. Pong remembers his grove of forests near Tsiang, and Pang recalls his gardens near Kiu. The three share their fond memories of their lives away from the palace (Trio – Ping, Pang, Pong: &quot;Ho una casa nell&#x27;Honan&quot; – &quot;I have a house in Honan&quot;). They turn their thoughts back to how they have been accompanying young princes to their deaths. As the palace trumpet sounds, the ministers ready themselves for another spectacle as they await the entrance of their Emperor.

&quot;Scene 2: The courtyard of the palace. Sunrise&quot;

The Emperor Altoum, father of Turandot, sits on his grand throne in his palace. Weary of having to judge his isolated daughter&#x27;s sport, he urges the Prince to withdraw his challenge, but the Prince refuses (Aria – Altoum, the Prince: &quot;Un giuramento atroce&quot; – &quot;An atrocious oath&quot;). Turandot enters and explains (&quot;In questa reggia&quot; – &quot;In this palace&quot;) that her ancestress of millennia past, Princess Lo-u-Ling, reigned over her kingdom &quot;in silence and joy, resisting the harsh domination of men&quot; until she was raped and murdered by an invading foreign prince. Turandot claims that Lo-u-Ling now lives in her and, out of revenge, Turandot has sworn never to let any man wed her. She warns the Prince to withdraw but again he refuses. The Princess presents her first riddle: &quot;Straniero, ascolta!&quot; – &quot;What is born each night and dies each dawn?&quot; The Prince correctly replies, &quot;Speranza&quot; – &quot;Hope&quot;. The Princess, unnerved, presents her second riddle (&quot;Guizza al pari di fiamma&quot; – &quot;What flickers red and warm like a flame, but is not fire?&quot;) The Prince thinks for a moment before replying, &quot;Sangue&quot; – &quot;Blood&quot;. Turandot is shaken. The crowd cheers the Prince, provoking Turandot&#x27;s anger. She presents her third riddle (&quot;Gelo che ti da foco&quot; – &quot;What is ice which gives you fire and which your fire freezes still more?&quot;). He proclaims, &quot;It is Turandot! Turandot!&quot;

The crowd cheers for the triumphant Prince. Turandot throws herself at her father&#x27;s feet and pleads with him not to leave her to the Prince&#x27;s mercy. The Emperor insists that an oath is sacred and that it is Turandot&#x27;s duty to wed the Prince (Duet – Turandot, Altoum, the Prince: &quot;Figlio del cielo&quot;). She cries out in despair, &quot;Will you take me by force? (&quot;Mi porterai con la forza?&quot;) The Prince stops her, saying that he has a riddle for her: &quot;You do not know my name. Tell me my name before sunrise, and at dawn, I will die.&quot; Turandot accepts. The Emperor then declares that he hopes that he will be able to call the Prince his son when the sun next rises.

===Act 3===
&quot;Scene 1: The palace gardens. Night&quot;

In the distance, heralds call out Turandot&#x27;s command: &quot;Cosi comanda Turandot&quot; – &quot;This night, none shall sleep in Peking! The penalty for all will be death if the Prince&#x27;s name is not discovered by morning.&quot; The Prince waits for dawn and anticipates his victory: &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; – &quot;Let no one sleep!&quot;

Ping, Pong, and Pang appear and offer the Prince women and riches if he will only give up Turandot (&quot;Tu che guardi le stelle&quot;), but he refuses. A group of soldiers then drag in Timur and Liù. They have been seen speaking to the Prince, so they must know his name. Turandot enters and orders Timur and Liù to speak. The Prince feigns ignorance, saying they know nothing. But when the guards begin to treat Timur harshly, Liù declares that she alone knows the Prince&#x27;s name, but she will not reveal it.

Ping demands the Prince&#x27;s name, and when Liù refuses to say it, she is tortured. Turandot is clearly taken aback by Liù&#x27;s resolve and asks Liù who or what gave her such a strong resolve. Liù answers, &quot;Princess, love!&quot; (&quot;Principessa, amore!&quot;). Turandot demands that Ping tear the Prince&#x27;s name from Liù, and Ping orders Liù to be tortured even more. Liù counters Turandot (&quot;Tu che di gel sei cinta&quot; – &quot;You who are encircled by ice&quot;), saying that Turandot too will learn the exquisite joy of being guided by caring and compassionate love. Having spoken, Liù seizes a dagger from a soldier&#x27;s belt and stabs herself. As she staggers towards the Prince and falls dead, the crowd screams for her to speak the Prince&#x27;s name. Since Timur is blind, he must be told about Liù&#x27;s death, and he cries out in anguish.

When Timur warns that the gods will be offended by Liù&#x27;s death, the crowd becomes subdued, very afraid and ashamed. The grieving Timur and the crowd follow Liù&#x27;s body as it is carried away. Everybody departs, leaving the Prince and Turandot alone. He reproaches Turandot for her cruelty (Duet – The Prince, Turandot: &quot;Principessa di morte&quot; – &quot;Princess of death&quot;), then takes her in his arms and kisses her in spite of her resistance.

The Prince tries to persuade Turandot to love him. At first, she feels disgusted, but after he kisses her, she feels herself becoming more ardently desiring to be held and compassionately loved by him. She admits that ever since she met the Prince, she realized she both hated and loved him. She tells him to ask for nothing more and to leave, taking his mystery with him. The Prince, however, then reveals his name: &quot;Calaf, son of Timur – Calaf, figlio di Timur&quot;, thereby placing his life in Turandot&#x27;s hands. She can now destroy him if she wants (Duet – Turandot, Calaf: &quot;Del primo pianto&quot;).

&quot;Scene 2: The courtyard of the palace. Dawn&quot;

Turandot and Calaf approach the Emperor&#x27;s throne. She declares that she knows the Prince&#x27;s name: (&quot;Diecimila anni al nostro Imperatore!&quot;) – &quot;It is ... love!&quot; The crowd sings and acclaims the two lovers (&quot;O sole! Vita! Eternità&quot;).

==Critical response==
While long recognised as the most tonally adventurous of Puccini&#x27;s operas, &quot;Turandot&quot; has also been considered a flawed masterpiece, and some critics have been hostile. Joseph Kerman states that &quot;Nobody would deny that dramatic potential can be found in this tale. Puccini, however, did not find it; his music does nothing to rationalize the legend or illuminate the characters.&quot; Kerman also wrote that while &quot;Turandot&quot; is more &quot;suave&quot; musically than Puccini&#x27;s earlier opera, &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;dramatically it is a good deal more depraved.&quot; However, Sir Thomas Beecham once remarked that anything that Joseph Kerman said about Puccini &quot;can safely be ignored&quot;.

Some of this criticism is possibly due to the standard Alfano ending (Alfano II), in which Liù&#x27;s death is followed almost immediately by Calaf&#x27;s &quot;rough wooing&quot; of Turandot, and the &quot;bombastic&quot; end to the opera. A later attempt at completing the opera was made, with the co-operation of the publishers, Ricordi, in 2002 by Luciano Berio. The Berio version is considered to overcome some of these criticisms, but critics such as Michael Tanner have failed to be wholly convinced by the new ending, noting that the criticism by the Puccini advocate Julian Budden still applies: &quot;Nothing in the text of the final duet suggests that Calaf&#x27;s love for Turandot amounts to anything more than a physical obsession: nor can the ingenuities of Simoni and Adami&#x27;s text for &#x27;Del primo pianto&#x27; convince us that the Princess&#x27;s submission is any less hormonal.&quot;

Ashbrook and Powers consider it was an awareness of this problem – an inadequate buildup for Turandot&#x27;s change of heart, combined with an overly successful treatment of the secondary character (Liù) – which contributed to Puccini&#x27;s inability to complete the opera. Another alternative ending, written by Chinese composer Hao Wei Ya, has Calaf pursue Turandot but kiss her tenderly, not forcefully; and the lines beginning &quot;Del primo pianto&quot; (Of the first tears) are expanded into an aria where Turandot tells Calaf more fully about her change of heart.

Concerning the compelling believability of the self-sacrificial Liù character in contrast to the two mythic protagonists, biographers note echoes in Puccini&#x27;s own life. He had had a servant named Doria, whom his wife accused of sexual relations with Puccini. The accusations escalated until Doria killed herself. In &quot;Turandot&quot;, Puccini lavished his attention on the familiar sufferings of Liù, as he had on his many previous suffering heroines. However, in the opinion of Father Owen Lee, Puccini was out of his element when it came to resolving the tale of his two allegorical protagonists. Finding himself completely outside his normal genre of &quot;verismo&quot;, he was incapable of completely grasping and resolving the necessary elements of the mythic, unable to &quot;feel his way into the new, forbidding areas the myth opened up to him&quot; – and thus unable to finish the opera in the two years before his unexpected death.

<text>The Story of the Chevalier des Grieux and Manon Lescaut ( ) is a novel by Antoine François Prévost. Most commonly referred to as simply &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, the novel is a tragic love story about a nobleman (known only as the Chevalier des Grieux) and a common woman (Manon Lescaut). Defying conventional morality, they run away together and commit an escalating series of crimes to fund a lifestyle of pleasure. The narrative is presented as a long speech by des Grieux nine months after Manon&#x27;s death, and is often interrupted by his retrospective emotions. The novel is regarded as a classic, and is the most reprinted novel in French literature, with over 250 editions.

The story was first published in 1731 in Amsterdam as the seventh and final volume of Prévost&#x27;s serial novel &quot;Memoirs and Adventures of a Man of Quality&quot; (). In 1733, all copies for sale in Paris were seized due to the volume&#x27;s morally questionable content. This effective ban contributed to an increase in popularity, and several unauthorized reprints of &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; without the rest of the &quot;Memoirs and Adventures&quot;. In 1753, Prévost published a revised version of the standalone &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, which is now the most commonly reprinted version.

On the novel&#x27;s first publication, the characters&#x27; choices were seen as shockingly immoral: their decision to live together without marriage is the start of a moral decline that also leads to gambling, fraud, theft, and murder. The novel was unusual for depicting Paris&#x27;s &quot;low life&quot; and for discussing the lovers&#x27; money problems in numerical detail: both choices contribute to its realism and its aura of scandal. 

The story is remembered for its tragic lovers, with des Grieux and Manon often compared to Romeo and Juliet or Tristan and Iseult. Over the centuries, audiences have judged Manon&#x27;s morals and personality differently. Eighteenth-century audiences saw her as an unworthy figure who nonetheless inspired affection and pity due to the sincerity of her love for des Grieux. Nineteenth-century responses saw her as a nearly mythological temptress, either a &quot;femme fatale&quot; who corrupts des Grieux or a hooker with a heart of gold who is redeemed through her death. More recent scholarly analyses see Manon as a victim of broader social forces, who is misunderstood and misrepresented by des Grieux&#x27;s narration of her experience.

&quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; has had dozens of adaptations into plays, ballets, operas, and films. The most renowned stage adaptations are three operas: &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; (1856) by Daniel Auber, &quot;Manon&quot; (1884) by Jules Massenet, and &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; (1893) by Giacomo Puccini. &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; also heavily inspired Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;La traviata&quot; (1853), through its influence on the play and novel &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot; by Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot;&quot;.&quot; Notable film adaptations include the Hollywood silent film &quot;When A Man Loves&quot; (1927), and &quot;Manon 70&quot; (1968), starring Catherine Deneuve as Manon.

==Plot summary==
The seventeen-year-old Chevalier des Grieux, a seminary student and the younger son of a noble family, falls in love at first sight with Manon, a common woman on her way to a convent. He persuades her to run away with him, disappointing his father and forfeiting his hereditary wealth. In Paris, the young lovers enjoy a blissful cohabitation, while des Grieux struggles to satisfy Manon&#x27;s taste for luxury. He acquires money by increasingly desperate means: borrowing from his unwaveringly loyal friend Tiberge, cheating gamblers, stealing, and murder. On three occasions, des Grieux&#x27;s wealth evaporates (by theft, in a house fire, etc.), prompting Manon to have sex with a richer man for money because she cannot stand living in penury.
Manon is deported to New Orleans as a prostitute and des Grieux travels with her. They pretend to be married and live in idyllic peace for a while. Des Grieux reveals their unmarried state to the Governor, Étienne Perier, and asks to be wed to Manon. Perier&#x27;s nephew, Synnelet, sets his sights on winning Manon&#x27;s hand. In despair, des Grieux challenges Synnelet to a duel and knocks him unconscious. Thinking he has killed the man and fearing retribution, the couple flee New Orleans. They venture into the wilderness of Louisiana, hoping to reach an English settlement. Manon dies of exposure and exhaustion and des Grieux buries her, in the tragic climax of the tale. Heartbroken, he is taken back to France by Tiberge.

== Composition and publication ==

Prévost likely composed &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; in March and April 1731. At the time, he was in Amsterdam, and was writing quickly to satisfy his contract with The Compagnie des Libraires d&#x27;Amsterdam. The story was first published as volume VII of his successful novel &quot;Mémoires et aventures d&#x27;un homme de Qualité&quot;, and was released with volumes V and VI in May 1731.

The narrative of Manon Lescaut is set apart from the main events of &quot;Mémoires et aventures&quot; with a preface and a preamble. The preface, titled &quot;Avis de l&#x27;Auteur&quot; (&quot;Note from the author&quot;), explains that the story seemed too large to include within the main narrative. It also says the story will be a morally-instructive example for readers, who will learn not to imitate des Grieux. The preamble is narrated by the unnamed &quot;man of quality&quot; () who is the protagonist of the main novel. He witnesses a group of prostitutes being deported. Curious about a particularly beautiful one (Manon), he speaks with the lover travelling with her (des Grieux). Two years later, he encounters des Grieux again, and asks to hear the full story of his experience in America.

A substantially revised edition appeared as a standalone publication in 1753. The standalone volume was titled &quot;Histoire du Chevalier des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut&quot;,&quot;&quot; which was the subtitle of volume VII of &quot;Mémoires et aventures d&#x27;un homme de qualité.&quot; This edition claimed on its title page to be published in Amsterdam by the Compagnie des Libraires, but was actually published in Paris by François Didot. In this edition, Prévost modified some of his most sensationalist language, added a new scene where Manon resists the seduction of an Italian prince, and rewrote the ending to replace des Grieux&#x27;s religious conversion with a more secular morality. The 1753 edition also added eight illustrations and an allegorical vignette on the first page.

==Style==
The story is delivered as a long speech to the protagonist of Prévost&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires et aventures&quot;, who is known only as &quot;the man of quality&quot; (), narrated by des Grieux nine months after Manon&#x27;s death. As such, it is an early example of the French genre of the confessional &quot;récit&quot;&quot;.&quot; All events are recounted in the first person, and shaped by des Grieux&#x27;s retrospective self-justifications. The novel does not use quotation marks, even when des Grieux relates what other characters have said. This blurs the boundaries between characters&#x27; speech and free indirect speech. Des Grieux&#x27;s telling frequently interrupts the narrative with apostrophes to absent figures and expressions of intense emotion. When he describes Manon, he often stutters or struggles to find words.

== Major themes ==

===Tragic love===
The story is particularly remembered for its tragic lovers, with des Grieux and Manon being compared to Romeo and Juliet and Tristan and Iseult. The scholar Jean Sgard argues that all of Prévost&#x27;s writing, including &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, is ultimately about &quot;the impossibility of happiness, the pervasiveness of evil and the misfortune attaching to the passions,&quot; all of which lead to &quot;mourning without end&quot;. Although the book depicts its protagonists as suffering due to their poverty, it is not a populist novel that advocates for social reform. Instead, the novel responds to their struggles with sadness and resignation. It is an early example of the emerging sentimental novel, in which love can justify anything, and important moral value is placed on strong emotion.

=== Scandalizing immorality ===
On the novel&#x27;s first publication, the characters and their choices were seen as shockingly immoral. Des Grieux&#x27;s rejection of the priesthood in favor of a sexual relationship without marriage, and his crimes of fraud and murder, challenged readers&#x27; expectations of acceptable actions for the hero of a novel. Manon&#x27;s willingness to have sex for money, and her general taste for pleasure and luxury, also seemed irreconcilable with her narrative role as a sympathetic love object. Both were sometimes seen as corrupted characters, and the novel&#x27;s realistic depiction of Paris&#x27;s &quot;low life&quot; was unusual and potentially threatening. Although the preface claims to disavow the characters&#x27; misbehavior, this is usually seen as an insincere pretense. The scandal was intensified by the historical setting of the novel: the story is set fifteen years before the year Prévost wrote it, so it takes place during the during the final years of Louis XIV&#x27;s conservative and orderly reign, rather than during the regency of King Louis XV when stories of corruption would be less surprising.

=== Social rank and money ===

The novel is unusual in the French tradition for its detailed depiction of lower-class locations and activities, especially the criminal world. Manon is considered &quot;the first commoner heroine in French fiction&quot;, and the gulf in social rank between her and the noble des Grieux is an obstacle to their love. Des Grieux and Manon sometimes struggle to understand each other due to their different backgrounds. For example, she does not understand why des Grieux is surprised and upset after she acquires money from other lovers; her different background leads her to see these as practical affairs, which do not threaten her love for des Grieux. Their difference in rank is also apparent in the different punishments they receive for their transgressions. When both lovers are imprisoned for some of their crimes, des Grieux&#x27;s aristocratic status shields him from the worst consequences while Manon ends up deported. Des Grieux often assumes — correctly — that even complete strangers will be willing to help him, if they share his aristocratic background. The novel thus highlights how justice is enforced unequally for different ranks of society.
A distinct, and even greater challenge is their lack of money. As an aristocrat, des Grieux is barred from ordinary employment; he could earn a professional income in the church, the military, or the law, but only if he still had his father&#x27;s support. The literary scholar Haydn Mason describes the novel&#x27;s setting as &quot;a harsh and sordid world, motivated almost universally by money.&quot; &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; is often highlighted as the first French novel to treat money as a major theme. Exact numbers are provided throughout the novel, an unusual choice which contributes to the novel&#x27;s realism. Manon begins the novel with a dowry of 300 &quot;livres&quot;, which is less than a tenth of an ordinary dowry for a woman entering a convent. The annual salary for a servant (Manon and de Grieux each keep one) was 100 &quot;livres&quot;, while Manon and de Grieux consider a &quot;respectable but simple&quot; annual income to be 6,000 &quot;livres&quot; per year. The financial gap between the lovers and their servants is large, but the gap between them and their patrons is even larger: two of Manon&#x27;s lovers offer her 20,000 and 30,000 &quot;livres&quot; as annual spending money.

=== The character of Manon ===
Since the novel&#x27;s first publication, substantial critical analysis has focused on the interpretation of Manon&#x27;s character. Because Manon&#x27;s words and actions are always related through the filter of des Grieux&#x27;s restrospective storytelling, readers can speculate about her real thoughts, feelings, and intentions. 

The earliest reviews in 1733 saw Manon as sympathetic but unexpectedly so, a &quot;catin&quot; (whore) who was unworthy and yet appealing due to the sincerity of her love for des Grieux. She was both blamed and forgiven for des Grieux&#x27;s corruption. The 1753 illustrations reinforced the image of Manon as someone to be loved, pitied, and forgiven for her mistakes. Eighteenth-century readers also saw Manon and des Grieux as helpless, fated to a tragic ending. The crimes of both were equally justified by their love and their financial need.

Manon&#x27;s reputation began to change in the nineteenth century, as she became a near-mythological figure. Rather than being a simple, lighthearted girl of common birth, she was depicted as either a &quot;femme fatale&quot; who corrupts des Grieux, or as a hooker with a heart of gold who is redeemed through her death. Adaptations like the popular opera &quot;Manon&quot; (1884) characterized Manon as powerfully seductive. Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot;, whose novel &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot; (1848) was heavily inspired by &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, wrote of Manon: &quot;you are sensuality, you are instinct, you are pleasure, the eternal temptation of man.&quot; The literary historian Naomi Segal summarizes this period as one in which most critics &quot;tend to view Manon as if she were a real woman and to heap upon her all the myths which operate within sexual politics in the non-fictional world&quot;.

Twentieth-century scholarly interpretations tended to see Manon as the victim, not of her own weakness, but of various social systems. For these readers, des Grieux&#x27;s version of events is considered suspect, and it is important to imagine how Manon might have narrated her story differently. Feminist theorists like Nancy K. Miller and Segal see Manon as a narrative victim of patriarchy. Cultural-historical theorists see the novel as a conflict between aristocratic and bourgeois ideologies; Manon is marginalized by her class, but makes savvy decisions to strategically ensure her survival. Outside of academia, modern readers sometimes find Manon underdeveloped as a character. Twenty-first century adaptations reinforced a sociological interpretation of Manon&#x27;s character. Several adaptations translate the story to more recent time periods in French history, in which Manon is always a non-conformist who boldly pursues love despite disadvantaged circumstances.

== Reception ==
&quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; gained popularity gradually. When first published in 1731 as part of &quot;Mémoires et aventures&quot;, it was not discussed separately from the rest of the novel. Over the next few years, it was increasingly seen as a highlight of that novel. Reviewers universally praised the novel, especially for its success inducing tears. &quot;Mémoires et aventures&quot; sold well in Holland and England on its first release, and a 1732 German translation was also successful, but it was largely ignored in France until 1733.In July 1733, the release of a new edition in Paris prompted a review in the clandestine &quot;Journal de la Cour ed de Paris&quot;, which brought enough attention to the book that the famous author Voltaire learned of it. On October 5, the French censors (who needed to approve all new publications) seized the copies currently for sale due to the book&#x27;s morally questionable content. This effective ban led to a sudden increase in popularity. As part of this new popularity, &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; was printed separately from &quot;Mémoires et aventures&quot; several times in 1733 and 1734, though these were unauthorized reprints. In 1753, Prévost responded with a high-quality revised edition of the standalone narrative. This volume was published with the title , which is typically shortened to &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;. Both &quot;Mémoires et aventures&quot; and the standalone &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; were reprinted frequently, with twenty editions of the first and eight of the latter appearing between 1731 and Prévost&#x27;s death in 1763.

Interest in the novel waned at the start of the nineteenth century, followed by another dramatic increase in popularity in 1830, when it was adapted as a ballet. Many further adaptations followed, with new reprints of &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; each year. In the late nineteenth century, editions were released with prefaces written by the famous French authors Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot; in 1875 and Anatole France in 1878. Over time, the novel came to be regarded as a historical classic. It became the most reprinted novel in French literature, with over 250 editions published between 1731 and 1981.

==Adaptations==

=== Stage adaptations ===
The first theatrical adaptation of &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; was in 1772. This was a comedy titled &quot;La Courtisane verteuse&quot; (&quot;The Virtuous Courtesan&quot;), which ends with Manon surviving. It attempted to mix a sensitive and emotional portrayal of the lovers with some humour, but reviewers found it far inferior to the novel. There were a few dramas in the eighteenth century and the Romantic period, followed by a larger number in the early twentieth century. Relatively few of the early theatrical adaptations of &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; have survived. Although ballets and operas of &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; became popular, only three theatrical dramas had even a modest success: &quot;La Courtisane verteuse&quot; (1772), &quot;Manon Lescaut et le chevalier Desgrieux&quot; (1820), and &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; (1851). All three include some incidental music, and the 1820 melodrama is also accompanied by a ballet. These adaptations dramatize the narrative in similar ways. Key scenes which are consistently included are the reconciliation at Saint-Sulpice, the scene at G. M.&#x27;s, the scene with the Italian prince, and des Grieux&#x27;s desperate burial of Manon in Louisiana.

Operatic adaptations of the novel are, in the words of the literary historian Jean Sgard, &quot;both numerous and late&quot; (). Sgard argues that operatic adaptations came late in the legacy of the novel because the story&#x27;s mixture of genres was incompatible with the dominant genre of serious opera characterized by Handel and Rameau. The first operatic adaptation, in 1836, was not a success. An important change in operatic precedent came after Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s highly successful 1853 opera, &quot;La traviata&quot; (&quot;The Fallen Woman&quot;). &quot;La traviata&quot; is based on the play and novel &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot; (The Lady of the Camellias) by Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot;, which are themselves heavily inspired by &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;. After 1853, six operas based on &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; were produced. These operas varied widely in how they adapted the story: it was divided into differing numbers of sections (from three to seven acts), and adaptations existed in the different operatic genres of comic opera, opera, and lyric drama. The most renowned adaptations of &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; are the operas by Daniel Auber (1856), Jules Massenet (1884), and Giacomo Puccini (1893).

In the theatrical and operatic adaptations, Manon&#x27;s three lovers are combined into just one. Theatrical adaptations simplify the plot to one instance of infidelity, a reconciliation, and then the final tragedy, and operatic adaptations forgo the novel&#x27;s long decline to dramatically juxtapose young love and tragic death. The literary scholar Jean Sgard argues that, by reducing the complexity of the narrative, the theatrical adaptations present the lovers as being disproportionately punished for a single mistake, rather than capturing the novel&#x27;s feeling of a gradual descent into immorality. He further argues that operatic adaptations are forced to focus on a one-note characterization of Manon, and each opera&#x27;s evaluation of her moral character is expressed in its depiction of her death.

=== Film adaptations ===

&quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; was adapted several times after the invention of film. These include a series of silent films, the most prominent of which is the 1927 Hollywood adaptation titled &quot;When A Man Loves&quot;. Early adaptations were period films, set in the early eighteenth century Later film adaptations translate the novel&#x27;s story to a contemporary setting. The 1949 film &quot;Manon&quot; by Henri-Georges Clouzot depicts des Grieux as a member of the French Resistance and Manon as a Nazi collaborator; he and Manon enter the black market and eventually stowaway to Palestine with a group of Jewish refugees. In &quot;Manon 70&quot; by Jean Aurel, released in 1968 and set in the near-future of 1970, des Grieux is a globetrotting radio journalist who tags along with Manon&#x27;s sugar baby lifestyle; instead of ending with Manon&#x27;s tragic death, this film concludes with both Manon and des Grieux hitchhiking. A pair of television miniseries directed by Jean-Xavier de Lestrade in 2014 and 2017 presents Manon as a contemporary young woman in a youth detention center who is failed by social systems and lives precariously.

==Translations==
The 1753 version of the novel is more common in modern editions. English translations of the original 1731 version of the novel include Helen Waddell&#x27;s 1931 translation with a foreword by George Saintsbury. For the 1753 revision there are translations by, among others, L. W. Tancock (Penguin, 1949—which divides the 2-part novel into a number of chapters), Donald M. Frame (Signet, 1961—which notes differences between the 1731 and 1753 editions), Angela Scholar (Oxford, 2004—with extensive notes and commentary), and Andrew Brown (Hesperus, 2004—with a foreword by Germaine Greer).

Henri Valienne (1854–1908), a physician and author of the first novel in the constructed language Esperanto, translated &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; into that language. His translation was published in Paris in 1908, and reissued by the British Esperanto Association in 1926.

<text>Radiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. They comprise Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O&#x27;Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead&#x27;s experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.

Radiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, in 1993. Their debut single, &quot;Creep&quot;, was a worldwide hit, and their popularity and critical standing rose with &quot;The Bends&quot; in 1995. Their third album, &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the greatest albums in popular music, with complex production and themes of modern alienation. Their fourth album, &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though &quot;Kid A&quot; divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Radiohead&#x27;s final album for EMI, &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; (2003), blended rock and electronic music, with lyrics addressing the war on terror.

Radiohead self-released their seventh album, &quot;In Rainbows&quot; (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and commercial success. Their eighth album, &quot;The King of Limbs&quot; (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot; (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood&#x27;s orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway and O&#x27;Brien have released solo albums. In 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.

By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK singles chart: &quot;Creep&quot; (1992), &quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out)&quot; (1996), &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; (1997), &quot;Karma Police&quot; (1997), &quot;No Surprises&quot; (1998), &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; (2001), and &quot;There There&quot; (2003). &quot;Creep&quot; and &quot;Nude&quot; (2008) reached the top 40 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and included five of their albums in its lists of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. Radiohead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.

==History==

===1985–1992: formation and first years===

The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, a private school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. The guitarist and singer Thom Yorke and the bassist Colin Greenwood were in the same year; the guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien was one year above, and the drummer Philip Selway was in the year above O&#x27;Brien. Colin&#x27;s brother, the multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, was three years below Colin and Yorke and the last to join. 

In 1985, the group formed On a Friday, the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school&#x27;s music room. The band disliked the school&#x27;s strict atmosphere—the headmaster once charged them for using a rehearsal room on a Sunday—and found solace in the music department. They credited their music teacher for introducing them to jazz, film scores, postwar avant-garde music, and 20th-century classical music.

While each member contributed songs in the band&#x27;s early period, Yorke emerged as the main songwriter. According to Colin, the band members picked their instruments because they wanted to play together, rather than through any particular interest: &quot;It was more of a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool.&quot; They played few gigs, and focused on rehearsing in village halls. Oxford had an active independent music scene in the late 1980s, but it centred on shoegazing bands such as Ride and Slowdive. On a Friday played their first gig in 1986 at Oxford&#x27;s Jericho Tavern. 

On the strength of an early demo, On a Friday were offered a record deal by Island Records, but they decided they were not ready and wanted to go to university first. They continued to rehearse on weekends and holidays, but did not perform for four years. At the University of Exeter, Yorke played with the band Headless Chickens, performing songs including future Radiohead material. He also met Stanley Donwood, who later became Radiohead&#x27;s cover artist.

In 1991, the band regrouped in Oxford, sharing a house on the corner of Magdalen Road and Ridgefield Road. They recorded another demo, which attracted the attention of Chris Hufford, Slowdive&#x27;s producer and the co-owner of Oxford&#x27;s Courtyard Studios. Hufford and his business partner, Bryce Edge, attended a concert at the Jericho Tavern; impressed, they became On a Friday&#x27;s managers. According to Hufford, at this point the band had &quot;all of the elements of Radiohead&quot;, but with a rougher, punkier sound and faster tempos. At Courtyard Studios, On a Friday recorded the &quot;Manic Hedgehog&quot; demo tape, named after an Oxford record shop.

In late 1991, Colin happened to meet the EMI A&amp;R representative Keith Wozencroft at a record shop and handed him a copy of the demo. Wozencroft was impressed and attended a performance. That November, On a Friday performed at the Jericho Tavern to an audience that included several A&amp;R representatives. It was only their eighth gig, but they had attracted interest from several record companies. On 21 December, On a Friday signed a six-album recording contract with EMI. At EMI&#x27;s request, they changed their name; &quot;Radiohead&quot; was taken from the song &quot;Radio Head&quot; on the Talking Heads album &quot;True Stories&quot; (1986). Yorke said the name &quot;sums up all these things about receiving stuff ... It&#x27;s about the way you take information in, the way you respond to the environment you&#x27;re put in.&quot;

===1992–1994: &quot;Creep&quot;, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and early success===
Radiohead recorded their debut EP, &quot;Drill&quot;, with Hufford and Edge at Courtyard Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was poor. As it was difficult for major labels such as EMI to promote bands in the UK, where independent labels dominated the indie charts, Radiohead&#x27;s managers planned to have Radiohead use American producers and tour aggressively in America, then return to build a following in the UK. Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, who had worked with the US bands Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., were enlisted to produce Radiohead&#x27;s debut album, recorded quickly in Oxford in 1992. With the release of their debut single, &quot;Creep&quot;, that September, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, not all of it favourable; &quot;NME&quot; described them as &quot;a lily-livered excuse for a rock band&quot;, and &quot;Creep&quot; was blacklisted by BBC Radio 1 as &quot;too depressing&quot;.
Radiohead released their debut album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, in February 1993. It reached number 22 in the UK charts. &quot;Creep&quot; and its follow-up singles &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot; and &quot;Stop Whispering&quot; failed to become hits, and &quot;Pop Is Dead&quot;, a non-album single, also sold poorly. O&#x27;Brien later called it &quot;a hideous mistake&quot;. Some critics compared Radiohead to the wave of grunge music popular in the early 1990s, dubbing them &quot;Nirvana-lite&quot;, and &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; initially failed to make a critical or a commercial impact. The members of Radiohead expressed dissatisfaction with the album in later years.

In early 1993, Radiohead began to attract listeners elsewhere. &quot;Creep&quot; had been played frequently on Israeli radio by the influential DJ Yoav Kutner, and in March, after the song became a hit there, Radiohead were invited to Tel Aviv for their first show overseas. Around the same time, &quot;Creep&quot; became a hit in America, a &quot;slacker anthem&quot; in the vein of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; by Nirvana and &quot;Loser&quot; by Beck. It reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock chart, number 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and number seven on the UK singles chart when EMI rereleased it in September. To build on the success, Radiohead embarked on a US tour supporting Belly and PJ Harvey, followed by a European tour supporting James and Tears for Fears.

===1994–1995: &quot;The Bends&quot;, critical recognition and growing fanbase===

Radiohead began work on their second album in 1994 with the veteran Abbey Road Studios producer John Leckie. Tensions were high, with mounting expectations to match the success of &quot;Creep&quot;. To break a deadlock, Radiohead toured Asia, Australasia and Mexico and found greater confidence performing their new music live. However, troubled by his new fame, Yorke became disillusioned with being &quot;at the sharp end of the sexy, sassy, MTV eye-candy lifestyle&quot; he felt he was helping to sell to the world.

The &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; EP and single, released in 1994, was Radiohead&#x27;s reaction, marking a transition towards the greater depth they aimed for on their second album. It was Radiohead&#x27;s first collaboration with their future producer, Nigel Godrich, then working under Leckie as an audio engineer, and the artist Stanley Donwood. Both have worked on every Radiohead album since. Though sales of &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; were low, it boosted Radiohead&#x27;s credibility in alternative circles, creating commercial opportunity for their next album.

Having introduced more new songs on tour, Radiohead finished recording their second album, &quot;The Bends&quot;, by 1995, and released it that March. It was driven by dense riffs and ethereal atmospheres, with greater use of keyboards. It received stronger reviews for its songwriting and performances. While Radiohead were seen as outsiders to the Britpop scene that dominated music media at the time, they were finally successful in the UK, as the singles &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;, &quot;High and Dry&quot;, &quot;Just&quot;, and &quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out)&quot; became chart successes. &quot;High and Dry&quot; became a modest hit, but Radiohead&#x27;s growing fanbase was insufficient to repeat the worldwide success of &quot;Creep&quot;. &quot;The Bends&quot; reached number 88 on the US album charts, and remains Radiohead&#x27;s lowest showing there. Jonny Greenwood later said &quot;The Bends&quot; was turning point for Radiohead: &quot;It started appearing in people&#x27;s [best-of] polls for the end of the year. That&#x27;s when it started to feel like we made the right choice about being a band.&quot; In later years, &quot;The Bends&quot; appeared in many publications&#x27; lists of the best albums of all time, including &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; 2012 edition of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; at No. 111.

In 1995, Radiohead again toured North America and Europe, this time in support of R.E.M., one of their formative influences and at the time one of the biggest rock bands in the world. Attention from famous fans such as the R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe, along with distinctive music videos for &quot;Just&quot; and &quot;Street Spirit&quot;, helped sustain Radiohead&#x27;s popularity outside the UK. The night before a performance in Denver, Colorado, Radiohead&#x27;s tour van was stolen, and with it their musical equipment. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a stripped-down acoustic set with rented instruments and several shows were cancelled. Their first live video, &quot;Live at the Astoria&quot;, was released in 1995.

===1995–1998: &quot;OK Computer&quot; and acclaim===

By late 1995, Radiohead had already recorded one song that would appear on their next record. &quot;Lucky&quot;, released as a single to promote the War Child charity&#x27;s &quot;The Help Album&quot;, was recorded in a brief session with Nigel Godrich, the young audio engineer who had assisted on &quot;The Bends&quot;. Radiohead decided to self-produce their next album with Godrich, and began work in early 1996. By July they had recorded four songs at their rehearsal studio, Canned Applause, a converted apple shed in the countryside near Didcot, Oxfordshire. In August 1996, Radiohead toured as the opening act for Alanis Morissette. They resumed recording not at a studio but at St. Catherine&#x27;s Court, a 15th-century mansion near Bath. The sessions were relaxed, with the band playing at all hours of the day, recording in different rooms, and listening to the Beatles, DJ Shadow, Ennio Morricone and Miles Davis for inspiration.&quot;

Radiohead released their third album, &quot;OK Computer&quot;, in May 1997. It found the band experimenting with song structures and incorporating ambient, avant-garde and electronic influences, prompting &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to call the album a &quot;stunning art-rock tour de force&quot;. Radiohead denied being part of the progressive rock genre, but critics began to compare their work to Pink Floyd. Some compared &quot;OK Computer&quot; thematically to the 1973 Pink Floyd album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, although Yorke said the lyrics were inspired by observing the &quot;speed&quot; of the world in the 1990s. Yorke&#x27;s lyrics, embodying different characters, had expressed what one magazine called &quot;end-of-the-millennium blues&quot; in contrast to the more personal songs of &quot;The Bends&quot;. According to the journalist Alex Ross, Radiohead had become &quot;the poster boys for a certain kind of knowing alienation&quot; as Talking Heads and R.E.M. had been before. &quot;OK Computer&quot; received acclaim. Yorke said he was &quot;amazed it got the reaction it did. None of us fucking knew any more whether it was good or bad. What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create.&quot;
&quot;OK Computer&quot; was Radiohead&#x27;s first number-one UK chart debut, and brought them commercial success around the world. Despite peaking at number 21 in the US charts, the album eventually met with mainstream recognition there, earning Radiohead their first Grammy Awards recognition, winning Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year. &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;Karma Police&quot; and &quot;No Surprises&quot; were released as singles, of which &quot;Karma Police&quot; was most successful internationally. &quot;OK Computer&quot; went on to become a staple of &quot;best-of&quot; British album lists. In the same year, Radiohead became one of the first bands in the world to have a website, and developed a devoted online following; within a few years, there were dozens of fansites devoted to them.

&quot;OK Computer&quot; was followed by the year-long Against Demons world tour, including Radiohead&#x27;s first headline Glastonbury Festival performance in 1997. Despite technical problems that almost caused Yorke to abandon the stage, the performance was acclaimed and cemented Radiohead as a major live act. Grant Gee, the director of the &quot;No Surprises&quot; video, filmed the band on tour for the 1999 documentary &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot;. The film portrays the band&#x27;s disaffection with the music industry and press, showing their burnout over the course of the tour. Since its release, &quot;OK Computer&quot; is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s and the Generation X era, and one of the greatest albums in recording history.

In 1998, Radiohead performed at a Paris Amnesty International concert and the Tibetan Freedom Concert. In March, they and Godrich entered Abbey Road Studios to record a song for the 1998 film &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Man of War&quot;, but were unsatisfied with the results and it went unreleased. Yorke described the period as a &quot;real low point&quot;; he and O&#x27;Brien developed depression, and the band came close to splitting up.

===1998–2001: &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and change in sound===
After the success of &quot;OK Computer&quot;, Radiohead bought a barn in Oxfordshire and converted it into a recording studio. They began work on their next album with Godrich in early 1999, working in studios in Paris, Copenhagen, and Gloucester before their new studio was completed. Although their success meant there was no longer pressure from their record label, tensions were high. The members had different visions for Radiohead&#x27;s future, and Yorke suffered from writer&#x27;s block, influencing him toward more abstract, fragmented songwriting. O&#x27;Brien kept an online diary of their progress. After nearly 18 months, recording was completed in April 2000.

Radiohead&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Kid A&quot;, was released in October 2000. A departure from &quot;OK Computer&quot;, &quot;Kid A&quot; featured a minimalist and textured style with more diverse instrumentation, including the ondes Martenot, programmed electronic beats, strings, and jazz horns. It debuted at number one in many countries, including the US, where it became the first Radiohead album to debut atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and the first US number-one album by any UK act since the Spice Girls in 1996. This success was attributed variously to marketing, to the album&#x27;s leak on the file-sharing network Napster a few months before its release, and to advance anticipation based, in part, on the success of &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Although Radiohead released no singles from &quot;Kid A&quot;, promos of &quot;Optimistic&quot; and &quot;Idioteque&quot; received radio play, and a series of &quot;blips&quot;, short videos set to portions of tracks, were played on music channels and released free online. Radiohead continued a 2000 tour of Europe in a custom-built tent free of advertising; they also promoted &quot;Kid A&quot; with three sold-out North American theatre concerts.

&quot;Kid A&quot; received a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some British critics saw &quot;Kid A&quot; as a &quot;commercial suicide note&quot; and &quot;intentionally difficult&quot;, and longed for a return to Radiohead&#x27;s earlier style. Fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, many saw it as the band&#x27;s best work. Yorke denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew expectations, saying: &quot;We&#x27;re not trying to be difficult ... We&#x27;re actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people ... What we&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t that radical.&quot; The album was ranked one of the best of all time by publications including &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone;&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and the &quot;Times&quot; named it the best album of the decade.

Radiohead&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, was released in May 2001. It comprised additional tracks from the &quot;Kid A&quot; sessions, including &quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot;, featuring the Humphrey Lyttelton Band. Radiohead stressed that they saw &quot;Amnesiac&quot; not as a collection of B-sides or outtakes from &quot;Kid A&quot; but an album in its own right. It topped the UK Albums Chart and reached number two in the US, and was nominated for a Grammy Award and the Mercury Music Prize. Radiohead released &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Knives Out&quot; as singles, their first since 1998. Radiohead began a North American tour, their first there in three years, in June 2001. With a string of sold-out dates, &quot;The Observer&quot; described it as &quot;the most sweeping conquest of America by a British group&quot; since Beatlemania, succeeding where bands such as Oasis had failed. Recordings from the &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; tours were released on &quot;I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings&quot; in November 2001.

=== 2002–2006: &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; and solo work ===
In July and August 2002, Radiohead toured Portugal and Spain, playing a number of new songs. For their next album, they sought to explore the tension between human and machine-generated music and capture a more immediate, live sound. They and Godrich recorded most of the material in two weeks at Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles. The band described the recording process as relaxed, in contrast to the tense sessions for &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. Radiohead also composed music for &quot;Split Sides&quot;, a dance piece by the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, which debuted in October 2003 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Radiohead&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;, was released in June 2003. Its lyrics were influenced by what Yorke called &quot;the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity&quot; following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush. The album was promoted with a website, radiohead.tv, where short films, music videos, and studio webcasts were streamed. &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; debuted at number one in the UK and number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, and was eventually certified platinum in the UK and gold in the US. The singles &quot;There There&quot;, &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; and &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot; achieved heavy circulation on modern rock radio. At the 2004 Grammy Awards, Radiohead were again nominated for Best Alternative Album, and Godrich and the engineer Darrell Thorp received the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album. In May 2003, Radiohead launched radiohead.tv, where they streamed short films, music videos and live webcasts from their studio. The material was released on the 2004 DVD &quot;The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time&quot;. A compilation of &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; B-sides, remixes and live performances, &quot;Com Lag (2plus2isfive)&quot;, was released in April 2004. In May 2003, Radiohead embarked on a world tour and headlined Glastonbury Festival for the second time. The tour finished in May 2004 with a performance at the Coachella Festival in California.
&quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; was Radiohead&#x27;s final album with EMI; in 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Radiohead as &quot;by far the world&#x27;s most popular unsigned band&quot;. Following the &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; tour, Radiohead went on hiatus to spend time with their families and work on solo projects. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood contributed to the Band Aid 20 charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, produced by Godrich. Greenwood composed soundtracks for the films &quot;Bodysong&quot; (2004) and &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; (2007); the latter was the first of several collaborations with the director Paul Thomas Anderson. In July 2006, Yorke released his debut solo album, &quot;The Eraser&quot;, comprising mainly electronic music. He stressed it was made with the band&#x27;s blessing, and that Radiohead were not breaking up. Jonny Greenwood said: &quot;He had to get this stuff out, and everyone was happy [for Yorke to make it] ... He&#x27;d go mad if every time he wrote a song it had to go through the Radiohead consensus.&quot; Selway and Jonny Greenwood appeared in the 2005 film &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; as members of the fictional band the Weird Sisters.

===2006–2009: departure from EMI, &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, and &quot;pay what you want&quot;===

Radiohead began work on their seventh album in February 2005. Instead of involving Godrich, Radiohead hired the producer Spike Stent, but the collaboration was unsuccessful. In September 2005, Radiohead contributed &quot;I Want None of This&quot;, a piano dirge, for the War Child charity album &quot;Help: A Day in the Life&quot;. The album was sold online, with &quot;I Want None of This&quot; the most downloaded track, though it was not released as a single. In late 2006, after touring Europe and North America with new material, Radiohead re-enlisted Godrich and resumed work in London, Oxford and rural Somerset, England. Recording ended in June 2007 and the recordings were mastered the following month.

In 2007, EMI was acquired by the private equity firm Terra Firma. Radiohead were critical of the new management, and no new deal was agreed. The &quot;Independent&quot; reported that EMI had offered Radiohead a £3 million advance, but had refused to relinquish rights to the band&#x27;s back catalogue. An EMI spokesman stated that Radiohead had demanded &quot;an extraordinary amount of money&quot;. Radiohead&#x27;s management and Yorke released statements denying that they had asked for a large advance, but had instead wanted control over their back catalogue.

Radiohead self-released their seventh album, &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, on their website on 10 October 2007 as a download, for any amount users wanted, including £0. The landmark pay-what-you-want release, the first for a major act, made headlines worldwide and created debate about the implications for the music industry. Media reaction was positive, and Radiohead were praised for finding new ways to connect with fans. However, it drew criticism from musicians such as Lily Allen and Kim Gordon, who felt it undercut less successful acts.

&quot;In Rainbows&quot; was downloaded an estimated 1.2 million times on the day of release. Colin Greenwood explained the internet release as a way of avoiding the &quot;regulated playlists&quot; and &quot;straitened formats&quot; of radio and TV, ensuring fans around the world could experience the music at the same time, and preventing leaks in advance of a physical release. A special &quot;discbox&quot; edition of &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, containing the record on vinyl, a book of artwork, and a CD of extra songs, was also sold from Radiohead&#x27;s website.

The retail version of &quot;In Rainbows&quot; was released in the UK in late December 2007 on XL Recordings and in North America in January 2008 on TBD Records, reaching number one in the UK and in the US. The success was Radiohead&#x27;s highest chart placement in the US since &quot;Kid A&quot;. It became their fifth UK number-one album and sold more than three million copies in one year. The album received acclaim for its more accessible sound and personal lyrics. It was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and won the 2009 Grammy awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package. It was nominated for five other Grammy awards, including Radiohead&#x27;s third nomination for Album of the Year. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed &quot;15 Step&quot; with the University of Southern California Marching Band at the televised award show.
The first single from &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, &quot;Jigsaw Falling into Place&quot;, was released in January 2008, followed by &quot;Nude&quot; in March, which debuted at number 37 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; it was Radiohead&#x27;s first song to enter the chart since &quot;High and Dry&quot; (1995) and their first US top 40 since &quot;Creep&quot;. In July, Radiohead released a digitally shot video for &quot;House of Cards&quot;. Radiohead held remix competitions for &quot;Nude&quot; and &quot;Reckoner&quot;, releasing the separated stems for fans to remix. In April 2008, Radiohead launched W.A.S.T.E. Central, a social networking service for Radiohead fans. In May, VH1 broadcast &quot;In Rainbows – From the Basement&quot;, a special episode of the music television show &quot;From the Basement&quot; in which Radiohead performed songs from &quot;In Rainbows&quot;. It was released on iTunes in June. From mid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured North America, Europe, Japan and South America to promote &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2009.

Days after Radiohead signed to XL, EMI announced a box set of Radiohead material recorded before &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, released in the same week as the &quot;In Rainbows&quot; special edition. Commentators including the &quot;Guardian&quot; saw the move as retaliation for the band choosing not to re-sign with EMI. In June 2008, EMI released a greatest hits album, &quot;&quot;. It was made without Radiohead&#x27;s involvement and contains only songs recorded under their contract with EMI. Yorke was critical of the release, calling it a &quot;wasted opportunity&quot;. As social media expanded around the turn of the decade, Radiohead gradually withdrew their public presence, with no promotional interviews or tours to promote new releases. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that around this time Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;popularity became increasingly untethered from the typical formalities of record promotion, placing them on the same level as Beyoncé and Kanye West&quot;. 

===2009–2010: reissues, singles and side projects===
In 2009, EMI reissued the albums recorded while Radiohead was signed to them in a series of expanded &quot;Collector&#x27;s Editions&quot;, without Radiohead&#x27;s involvement. Press reaction expressed concern that EMI was exploiting Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue. In May, Radiohead began new recording sessions with Godrich. In August, they released &quot;Harry Patch (In Memory Of)&quot;, a tribute song to Harry Patch, the last surviving British soldier to have fought in World War I, with proceeds donated to the British Legion. The song has no conventional rock instrumentation, and instead comprises Yorke&#x27;s vocals and a string arrangement composed by Jonny Greenwood. Later that month, another new song, &quot;These Are My Twisted Words&quot;, featuring krautrock-like drumming and guitars, was leaked via torrent, possibly by Radiohead. It was released as a free download on the Radiohead website the following week. Commentators saw the releases as part of Radiohead&#x27;s new unpredictable release strategy, without the need for traditional marketing.

In 2009, Yorke formed a new band, Atoms for Peace, to perform his solo material, with musicians including Godrich and the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea. They played eight North American shows in 2010. In January 2010, Radiohead played their only full concert of the year in the Los Angeles Henry Fonda Theater as a benefit for Oxfam. Tickets were auctioned, raising over half a million US dollars for the NGO&#x27;s 2010 Haiti earthquake relief. That December, a fan-made video of the performance, &quot;Radiohead for Haiti&quot;, was released via YouTube and torrent with Radiohead&#x27;s support and a &quot;pay-what-you-want&quot; link to donate to Oxfam. Radiohead also released the soundboard recording of their 2009 Prague performance for use in a fan-made concert video, &quot;Live in Praha&quot;. The videos were described as examples of Radiohead&#x27;s openness to fans and positivity toward non-commercial internet distribution.

In June 2010, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a surprise set at Glastonbury Festival, performing &quot;Eraser&quot; and Radiohead songs. Selway released his debut solo album, &quot;Familial&quot;, in August. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described it as a collection of &quot;hushed&quot; folk songs in the tradition of Nick Drake, with Selway on guitar and vocals.

=== 2011–2012: &quot;The King of Limbs&quot; ===

Radiohead released their eighth album, &quot;The King of Limbs&quot;, on 18 February 2011 as a download from their website. Following the protracted recording and more conventional rock instrumentation of &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, Radiohead developed &quot;The King of Limbs&quot; by sampling and looping their recordings with turntables. It was followed by a retail release in March through XL, and a special &quot;newspaper album&quot; edition in May.

&quot;The King of Limbs&quot; sold an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 copies through Radiohead&#x27;s website. The retail edition debuted at number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number seven on the UK Albums Chart. It was nominated for five categories in the 54th Grammy Awards. Two tracks not included on &quot;The King of Limbs&quot;, &quot;Supercollider&quot; and &quot;The Butcher&quot;, were released as a double A-side single for Record Store Day in April. A compilation of &quot;King of Limbs&quot; remixes by various artists, &quot;TKOL RMX 1234567&quot;, was released in September.

To perform the rhythmically complex &quot;King of Limbs&quot; material live, Radiohead enlisted a second drummer, Clive Deamer, who had worked with Portishead and Get the Blessing. In June, Radiohead played a surprise performance on the Park stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, performing songs from &quot;The King of Limbs&quot; for the first time. With Deamer, Radiohead recorded &quot;The King of Limbs: Live from the Basement&quot;, released online in August 2011. It was also broadcast by international BBC channels and released on DVD and Blu-ray in January 2012. The performance included two new songs, &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Staircase&quot;, released as a double A-side download single in December 2011. In February 2012, Radiohead began their first extended North American tour in four years, including dates in the United States, Canada and Mexico. On tour, they recorded material at Jack White&#x27;s studio Third Man Records, but discarded the recordings.

On 16 June 2012, an hour before gates were due to open at Toronto&#x27;s Downsview Park for the final concert of Radiohead&#x27;s North American tour, the roof of the venue&#x27;s temporary stage collapsed, killing the drum technician Scott Johnson and injuring three other members of Radiohead&#x27;s road crew. After rescheduling the tour, Radiohead paid tribute to Johnson at their next concert, in Nîmes, France, in July. In June 2013, Live Nation Canada Inc, two other organisations and an engineer were charged with 13 charges under Ontario health and safety laws. In September 2017, after several delays, the case was dropped under the Jordan ruling, which sets strict time limits on trials. Radiohead released a statement condemning the decision. A 2019 inquest returned a verdict of accidental death.

===2013–2014: side projects and move to XL===
After the &quot;King of Limbs &quot;tour, the band members worked on further side projects. In February 2013, Yorke and Godrich&#x27;s band, Atoms for Peace, released an album, &quot;Amok&quot;. The pair made headlines that year for their criticism of the free music streaming service Spotify. Yorke accused Spotify of only benefiting major labels with large back catalogues, and encouraged artists to build their own &quot;direct connections&quot; with audiences instead.

In February 2014, Radiohead released an app, &quot;Polyfauna&quot;, a collaboration with the British digital arts studio Universal Everything, with music and imagery from &quot;The King of Limbs&quot;. In May, Yorke contributed a soundtrack, &quot;Subterranea&quot;, to &quot;The&quot; &quot;Panic Office&quot;, an installation of Radiohead artwork in Sydney, Australia. Yorke and Selway released their solo albums &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Modern Boxes&quot; and &quot;Weatherhouse&quot; in late 2014. Jonny Greenwood scored his third Anderson film, &quot;Inherent Vice&quot;; it features a version of an unreleased Radiohead song, &quot;Spooks&quot;, performed by Greenwood and members of Supergrass. &quot;Junun&quot;, a collaboration between Greenwood, Godrich, the Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur and Indian musicians, was released in November 2015, accompanied by a documentary directed by Anderson.

In April 2016, Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue was acquired by XL Recordings, which had released the retail editions of &quot;In Rainbows&quot; and &quot;The King of Limbs&quot; and most of Yorke&#x27;s solo work. XL reissued Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue on vinyl in May 2016.

=== 2015–2016: &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot; ===
Radiohead began work on their ninth studio album in September 2014. In 2015, they resumed work in the La Fabrique studio near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. The sessions were marred by the death of Godrich&#x27;s father and Yorke&#x27;s separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died from cancer in 2016. Work was interrupted when Radiohead were commissioned to write the theme for the 2015 James Bond film &quot;Spectre&quot;. After their song, &quot;Spectre&quot;, was rejected, Radiohead released it on the audio streaming site SoundCloud on Christmas Day 2015.

Radiohead&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot;, was released digitally in May 2016, followed by retail versions in June via XL Recordings. It was promoted with music videos for the singles &quot;Daydreaming&quot; (directed by Anderson) and &quot;Burn the Witch&quot;. The album includes several songs written years earlier, including &quot;True Love Waits&quot;, and strings and choral vocals performed by the London Contemporary Orchestra. It became Radiohead&#x27;s sixth UK number-one album and reached number three in the US. It was the fifth Radiohead album nominated for the Mercury Prize, making Radiohead the most shortlisted act in Mercury history, and was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Song (for &quot;Burn the Witch&quot;) at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. It appeared on several publications&#x27; lists of the best albums of the year.
In 2016, 2017 and 2018, Radiohead toured Europe, Japan, and North and South America, including headline shows at the Coachella and Glastonbury festivals. They were joined again by Deamer. The tours included a performance in Tel Aviv in July 2017, disregarding the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign for an international cultural boycott of Israel. The performance was criticised by artists including Roger Waters and Ken Loach, and a petition urging Radiohead to cancel it was signed by more than 50 prominent figures. In a statement, Yorke responded: &quot;We don&#x27;t endorse Netanyahu any more than Trump, but we still play in America. Playing in a country isn&#x27;t the same as endorsing the government. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression.&quot;

=== 2017–2020: &quot;OKNOTOK&quot; and &quot;MiniDiscs [Hacked]&quot; ===
In June 2017, Radiohead released a 20th-anniversary &quot;OK Computer&quot; reissue, &quot;OKNOTOK 1997 2017&quot;, comprising a remastered version of the album, B-sides, and previously unreleased material. Radiohead promoted the reissue with music videos for the bonus tracks &quot;I Promise&quot;, &quot;Man of War&quot; and &quot;Lift&quot;. &quot;OKNOTOK&quot; reached number two on the UK Album Chart, boosted by Radiohead&#x27;s televised Glastonbury performance that week, and reached number 23 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In August, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a benefit concert in Le Marche, Italy, following the August 2016 Central Italy earthquake. In September, the nature documentary series &quot;Blue Planet II&quot; premiered featuring a new version of the &quot;King of Limbs&quot; track &quot;Bloom&quot;, created with the composer Hans Zimmer.
Radiohead were nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017, their first year of eligibility. They were nominated again in 2018 and inducted the following March. Though Jonny Greenwood and Yorke were uninterested in the event, Selway and O&#x27;Brien attended and made speeches. The singer David Byrne, one of Radiohead&#x27;s formative influences, gave a speech praising Radiohead&#x27;s musical and release innovations, which he said had influenced the whole music industry.

In June 2019, several hours of recordings made by Radiohead during the &quot;OK Computer&quot; period leaked online. In response, Radiohead made them available to purchase online as &quot;MiniDiscs [Hacked]&quot;, with all proceeds to the environmentalist group Extinction Rebellion. In December, Radiohead made their discography available free on YouTube. The following January, they launched the Radiohead Public Library, an online archive of their work, including music videos, live performances, artwork and the 1998 documentary &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot;. Radiohead suspended their online content for Blackout Tuesday on 2 June, protesting racism and police brutality.

In 2017, Selway released his third solo work, the soundtrack to the film &quot;Let Me Go&quot;. Jonny Greenwood was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score for his fifth collaboration with Anderson, &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; (2017), and scored his second film by Lynne Ramsay, &quot;You Were Never Really Here&quot; (2018). Yorke released his first feature film soundtrack, &quot;Suspiria&quot; (2018), and his third solo album, &quot;Anima&quot; (2019), backed by a short film directed by Anderson. In 2020, O&#x27;Brien released his debut solo album, &quot;Earth&quot;, under the moniker EOB. He had been writing songs for years, but found they did not fit Radiohead. In April, to compensate for the lack of performances during the COVID-19 pandemic, Radiohead began streaming old concert films on YouTube on a weekly basis.

=== 2021–present: &quot;Kid A Mnesia&quot;, the Smile and side projects ===
Radiohead abandoned plans to tour in 2021 due to the pandemic. In November, they released &quot;Kid A Mnesia&quot;, an anniversary reissue compiling &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and previously unreleased material. It was promoted with download singles and videos for the previously unreleased tracks &quot;If You Say the Word&quot; and &quot;Follow Me Around&quot;. Plans for an art installation based on the albums were cancelled due to logistical problems and the pandemic. Instead, Radiohead created a free digital experience, &quot;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition&quot;, for PlayStation 5, macOS and Windows.

In a livestream event held by Glastonbury Festival in May 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile, with the drummer Tom Skinner. Greenwood said the band was a way to work with Yorke during the COVID-19 lockdowns. In May 2022, they released their debut album, &quot;A Light for Attracting Attention&quot;, to acclaim. The &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Ryan Dombal described it as &quot;instantly, unmistakably&quot; the best album from a Radiohead side project. The Smile toured internationally between 2022 and 2024, and released the albums &quot;Wall of Eyes&quot; and &quot;Cutouts&quot;, recorded simultaneously, in 2024. Critics interpreted the Smile as a liberating, lower-pressure project for Yorke and Greenwood, with more jazz, krautrock and progressive rock influences and a looser, wilder sound.

Colin Greenwood toured Australia in 2022 as part of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis&#x27;s band. He toured with Cave in 2023 and 2024, performed on Cave&#x27;s 2024 album &quot;Wild God&quot;, and released a book of his photographs of Radiohead in October 2024. Selway released his third solo album, &quot;Strange Dance&quot;, in February 2023. &quot;Jarak Qaribak&quot;, an album by Jonny Greenwood and the Israeli rock musician Dudu Tassa, was released the following June. Yorke released his second film soundtrack, &quot;Confidenza&quot;, in April 2024, and began a solo tour in October. 

Selway said in 2023 that it was healthy for the Radiohead members to work with other musicians, that all the projects came under the Radiohead &quot;umbrella&quot;, and that Radiohead &quot;still very much exists&quot;. Radiohead rehearsed in 2024, but Jonny Greenwood said they planned to focus on individual projects in 2025. Yorke said: &quot;I think we&#x27;ve earned the right to do what makes sense to us without having to explain ourselves or be answerable to anyone else&#x27;s historical idea of what we should be doing.&quot; 

Pressure for Radiohead to boycott Israel grew following the outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war in 2023. Jonny Greenwood was criticised for performing in Tel Aviv with Tassa, and responded in a statement that Israeli artists should not be silenced. In October, Yorke temporarily left the stage after he was heckled by a pro-Palestine protester at a solo concert.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
Radiohead&#x27;s musical style has been described as art rock, alternative rock, electronica, experimental rock, progressive rock, grunge, art pop, and electronic rock. Critics found elements of grunge in their first album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;. Their second album, &quot;The Bends&quot;, is sometimes described as Britpop, though Radiohead disliked Britpop, seeing it as a &quot;backwards-looking&quot; pastiche. O&#x27;Brien said they quickly tired of songs &quot;with distorted guitars all the way through&quot;, preferring separation and &quot;riffs and melodies that interweave at different registers&quot;.

Radiohead songs often use pivot notes and pedal points, creating &quot;looser, roomier&quot; harmonies and a &quot;bittersweet, doomy&quot; feeling. Many use unusual or changing time signatures, such as &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot;, &quot;Morning Bell&quot; and &quot;15 Step&quot;. O&#x27;Brien said Radiohead were hesitant to create &quot;epic&quot; music, which they felt had negative associations of stadium rock. However, he conceded that &quot;epic is also about beauty, like a majestic view&quot;, and cited &quot;Weird Fishes/Arpeggi&quot; as an example of a song that was &quot;obviously epic in scope&quot;.

Jonny Greenwood said Radiohead strive to find a middle ground between their experimental influences and rock music, and were driven by a desire not to repeat themselves rather than to be &quot;experimental&quot;. The drummer Clive Deamer, who has recorded and performed with Radiohead since 2011, said Radiohead do not see themselves as a rock band and that their methodology is closer to jazz: &quot;They deliberately try to avoid cliché and standard forms for the sake of the song ... Rock bands don&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s far more like a jazz mentality.&quot; Yorke dismissed accusations that Radiohead make &quot;depressing&quot; music, saying in 2004: &quot;Depressing music to me is just shit music. It&#x27;s like air freshener – just a nasty little poison in the air.&quot;

=== Songwriting ===
Though Yorke acts as Radiohead&#x27;s director, all the members have a role in arrangement. In 2004, Yorke said that while his power was once &quot;absolutely unbalanced&quot; and he would &quot;subvert everybody else&#x27;s power at all costs&quot;, later albums had been more democratic. He apologised to his bandmates for his earlier &quot;control freak&quot; behaviour. O&#x27;Brien said that no member was replaceable and each was comfortable with their position.

Radiohead songs usually begin as a sketch by Yorke, which is harmonically developed by Jonny Greenwood before the rest of the band develop their parts. Whereas Yorke does not read sheet music, Greenwood is trained in music theory. In &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Ryan Dombal wrote that &quot;the duo&#x27;s left brain-right brain dynamic has proven to be one of the most adventurous in rock history&quot;. While Jonny Greenwood plays most lead guitar parts, O&#x27;Brien often creates ambient effects, making extensive use of effects units.

Radiohead often attempt several approaches to songs, and may develop them over years. For example, Radiohead first performed &quot;True Love Waits&quot; in 1995 before releasing it in a different arrangement on &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot; in 2016. Greenwood said he saw Radiohead as &quot;just a kind of an arrangement to form songs using whatever technology suits the song&quot;, be it a cello or a laptop.

The &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; sessions brought a change in Radiohead&#x27;s music and working methods. Since their shift from conventional rock instrumentation, the members have gained flexibility and often switch instruments. On &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, Yorke played keyboard and bass, Jonny Greenwood played ondes Martenot, Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O&#x27;Brien and Selway worked with drum machines and digital manipulation.

=== Influences ===
Among Radiohead&#x27;s earliest influences were Queen, Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd and Elvis Costello, post-punk acts such as Joy Division, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Magazine, and significantly 1980s alternative rock bands such as R.E.M., U2, the Pixies, the Smiths and Sonic Youth. Jonny Greenwood named the Magazine guitarist John McGeoch his biggest guitar influence. By the mid-1990s, Radiohead were adopting recording methods from hip hop, inspired by the sampling work of DJ Shadow, and became interested in using computers to generate sounds. Radiohead cited 60s and 70s jazz artists such as Miles Davis, Charles Mingus and Alice Coltrane as influences. According to Jonny Greenwood, &quot;We bring in our favourite jazz albums, and say: we want to do this. And we enjoy the sound of our failing!&quot; He likened their jazz influence to 1950s English bands imitating American blues records. Other influences include the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone, 1960s rock groups such as the Beatles and the Beach Boys, and Phil Spector&#x27;s &quot;wall of sound&quot; production.

The electronic music of &quot;Kid A&quot; was inspired by Yorke&#x27;s admiration for artists signed to the record label Warp Records, such as Aphex Twin and Autechre. In 2013, Yorke named Aphex Twin as his biggest influence. &quot;Kid A&quot; also samples early computer music. 1970s krautrock bands such as Can and Neu! were other major influences during this period. Jonny Greenwood&#x27;s interest in 20th-century classical music also had a role, citing the influence of the composers Krzysztof Penderecki and Olivier Messiaen. Since the recording of &quot;Kid A&quot;, Greenwood has played the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument popularised by Messiaen. While recording &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, Radiohead mentioned rock, electronic, hip hop and experimental musicians as influences, including Björk, M.I.A, Liars, Modeselektor and Spank Rock. In 2011, Yorke denied that Radiohead had set out to make &quot;experimental music&quot;, saying they were &quot;constantly absorbing music&quot; and that a variety of musicians are always influencing them.

Yorke is Radiohead&#x27;s lyricist. Though his early lyrics were personal, from &quot;Kid A&quot; on, he experimented with cutting up words and phrases and assembling them at random. He does not write biographically, saying he instead writes &quot;spasmodic&quot; lyrics based on imagery and taken from external sources such as television. He deliberately uses cliches, idioms and other common expressions, suggesting &quot;a mind consumed by meaningless data&quot;. The &quot;New Republic&quot; writer Ryan Kearney speculated that Yorke&#x27;s use of common expressions, which he described as &quot;Radioheadisms&quot;, was an attempt &quot;to sap our common tongue of meaning and expose the vapidity of everyday discourse&quot;. According to Yorke, many of his lyrics are motivated by anger, expressing his political and environmental concerns and written as &quot;a constant response to doublethink&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that Yorke&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot; were less cynical, conveying wonder and amazement.

==Legacy and influence==
Radiohead are cited as one of the foremost rock bands of the 21st century. By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums. Their 90s albums &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; influenced a generation of British acts, including Coldplay, Keane, James Blunt and Travis. &quot;&quot; Radiohead&#x27;s experimental approach is credited with expanding alternative rock.

According to the &quot;AllMusic&quot; journalist Stephen Thomas Erlewine, in the early 21st century, Radiohead became &quot;a touchstone for everything that is fearless and adventurous in rock&quot;, succeeding David Bowie, Pink Floyd and Talking Heads. In 2001, Johnny Marr, the guitarist for one of Radiohead&#x27;s early influences, the Smiths, said that Radiohead was the act that had &quot;come closest to the genuine influence of the Smiths&quot;.

In 2003, the &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau wrote that Radiohead were &quot;the only youngish band standing that combines critical consensus with the ability to fill a venue larger than the Hammerstein Ballroom&quot;. Gavin Haynes of &quot;NME&quot; described Radiohead in 2014 as &quot;our generation&#x27;s Beatles&quot;. In 2020, the academic Daphne Brooks described Radiohead as &quot;the blackest white rock band to emerge over the past 30 years&quot;, citing their black jazz influences, influence on black artists, and their &quot;introspective other worlds&quot;, which parallel the work of radical black artists.

=== Industry ===
&quot;Kid A&quot; is credited for pioneering the use of the internet to stream and promote music. The pay-what-you-want release for &quot;In Rainbows&quot; is credited as a major step for music distribution. &quot;Forbes&quot; wrote that it &quot;helped forge the template for unconventional album releases in the internet age&quot;, ahead of artists such as Beyoncé and Drake. Speaking at Radiohead&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019, the Talking Heads singer David Byrne, an early influence on Radiohead, praised their musical and release innovations, which he said had influenced the entire music industry.

=== Accolades ===

Radiohead&#x27;s work places highly in both listener polls and critics&#x27; lists of the best music of the 1990s and 2000s. In a 2004 list composed by 55 musicians, writers and industry executives, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Radiohead 73rd-greatest artist of all time. They have been listed among the greatest bands of all time by &quot;Spin&quot; (15th) and among the greatest artists by VH1 (29th). They were also named the third-best British band in history by Harry Fletcher of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.

Radiohead are the most nominated act for the Mercury Prize, with five nominated albums. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019. In 2009, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted Radiohead the second-best artist of the 2000s, behind Green Day. In 2021, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; readers voted &quot;OK Computer, Kid A&quot; and &quot;In Rainbows&quot; among the ten greatest albums of the preceding 25 years. Jonny Greenwood and O&#x27;Brien were both included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s lists of the best guitarists and Yorke in its lists of the greatest singers.

==Collaborators==

Nigel Godrich first worked with Radiohead as an audio engineer on their second album, &quot;The Bends&quot;. He has produced all their studio albums since their third album, &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Godrich has been dubbed the band&#x27;s &quot;sixth member&quot;, an allusion to George Martin being called the &quot;Fifth Beatle&quot;. In 2016, Godrich said: &quot;I can only ever have one band like Radiohead who I&#x27;ve worked with for this many years. That&#x27;s a very deep and profound relationship. The Beatles could only have ever had one George Martin; they couldn&#x27;t have switched producers halfway through their career. All that work, trust, and knowledge of each other would have been thrown out of the window and they&#x27;d have to start again.&quot;

Godrich also plays Chieftain Mews, a long-running character who appears in Radiohead&#x27;s promotional material. The journalist Mac Randall described Mews as &quot;a 21st-century Max Headroom&quot; who &quot;intones non-sequiturs&quot;. Yorke credited the filmmaker Chris Bran for his creation on the DVD &quot;The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time&quot;.

The graphic artist Stanley Donwood met Yorke when they were art students. Together, they have produced all of Radiohead&#x27;s album covers and visual artwork since 1994. Donwood works in the studio with the band as they record, allowing the music to influence the artwork. He and Yorke won a Grammy in 2002 for the special edition of &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, packaged as a library book.

Since Radiohead&#x27;s formation, Andi Watson has been Radiohead&#x27;s lighting and stage director, designing the visuals of their live concerts. Peter &quot;Plank&quot; Clements has worked with Radiohead since before &quot;The Bends&quot;, overseeing the technical management of studio recordings and live performances. Jim Warren has been Radiohead&#x27;s live sound engineer since their first tour in 1992, and recorded early tracks including &quot;High and Dry&quot; and &quot;Pop Is Dead&quot;. Radiohead enlisted the drummer Clive Deamer to help perform the complex rhythms of &quot;The King of Limbs&quot;, and has performed and recorded with them since. Paul Thomas Anderson has directed several music videos for Yorke and Radiohead, and has collaborated with Jonny Greenwood on several film scores and the 2015 documentary &quot;Junun&quot;. Radiohead are managed by Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge of Courtyard Management. Hufford produced their first release, the &quot;Drill&quot; EP, and co-produced their first album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;.

== Song catalogue ==

Radiohead recorded their first six albums under contract with Parlophone, a subsidiary of EMI. The contract ended with the release of &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; in 2003. They did not renew the contract for their next album, &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, as EMI would not give them control over their back catalogue and they did not trust the new owner, Guy Hands. Radiohead have self-released their subsequent work, with retail editions released by XL Recordings. In October 2015, Radiohead sued Parlophone for deductions made from downloads of their back catalogue.

In September 2012, EMI was bought by Universal Music. The European Commission approved the deal on the condition that Universal Music divest Parlophone, which controlled the Radiohead records. In February 2013, Parlophone was bought by Warner Music Group (WMG). As a condition of the purchase, WMG made an agreement with the Merlin Network and the trade group Impala to divest 30% of the Parlophone catalogues to independent labels, with artist approval. In April 2016, WMG transferred Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue to XL. &quot;&quot; and the reissues released by EMI in 2008 without Radiohead&#x27;s approval were removed from streaming services.

<text>Juan Moreno y Herrera-Jiménez (born 30 July 1948), commonly known as Jean Reno (), is a French-Spanish actor. He established himself as a leading man of French cinema through his collaborations with director Luc Besson, and has worked in numerous international productions. He is a three-time César Award nominee - Best Actor for &quot;Les Visiteurs&quot; (1993) and &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994), and Best Supporting Actor for &quot;The Big Blue&quot; (1988).

Reno&#x27;s other notable films include &quot;Le Dernier Combat&quot; (1983), &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (1990), &quot;&quot; (1996), &quot;Ronin&quot; (1998), &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998), &quot;Crimson Rivers&quot; (2000), &quot;Wasabi&quot; (2001), &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (2006), &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2006), &quot;Flushed Away&quot; (2006), &quot;Hector and the Search for Happiness&quot; (2014), &quot;The Promise&quot; (2016), and &quot;Da 5 Bloods&quot; (2020). 

==Early life==
Reno was born Juan Moreno y Herrera-Jiménez, on 30 July 1948 in Casablanca, French Morocco. His parents were Spanish, natives of Sanlúcar de Barrameda and Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia. They had moved to North Africa to find work and escape Francoist Spain. Reno has a younger sister named María Teresa (&quot;Maite&quot;); the children were raised Catholic. Their father was a linotypist. Their mother died when he was a teenager. 

At the age of 17, Reno and his family moved to France, where he studied acting at the Cours Simon School of Drama in Paris. Reno also served in the French Army, as his military service became mandatory once his family had gained French citizenship.

Reno learned Spanish from his parents, Arabic and French growing up in Morocco, and Italian from studying it as a special interest and acting in Italian films.

==Career==

After he started to get acting jobs in France, Juan adopted the French version of his name, Jean, and shortened his surname to Reno. Due to his large frame (), Reno was called on to play &quot;heavies&quot; in his early career. He later appeared in romantic comedies and action films. He began his film career in France, appearing in many films by director Luc Besson, including his early &quot;Le Dernier Combat&quot; (1983). The two have continued to work together, collaborating in films produced, written, or directed by Besson. Of their joint work, those that have achieved the most critical and commercial success include: &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (1990), and the English-language films &quot;The Big Blue&quot; (1988) and &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994). 

Reno did the voice-over for Mufasa in the French-language version of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, a role originally performed in English by James Earl Jones. Reno has starred in such high-profile American films as &quot;French Kiss&quot; (1995) with Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline, &quot;&quot; (1996) with Tom Cruise, &quot;Ronin&quot; (1998) with Robert De Niro, and &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998) with Matthew Broderick. Reno turned down the role of Agent Smith in &quot;The Matrix&quot;. He also acted in French productions: &quot;Les Visiteurs&quot; (1993) (which was remade in English as &quot;Just Visiting&quot; in 2001); &quot;The Crimson Rivers&quot; (2000), and &quot;Jet Lag&quot; (&quot;Décalage Horaire&quot;) by Danièle Thompson (2002), which was also a box-office success in France.

In 2006, Reno had a prominent role in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; 2006 remake and its sequel &quot;The Pink Panther 2&quot;, playing Gilbert Ponton, opposite Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau. He portrayed Captain Bezu Fache in the Ron Howard film &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. Among his most successful films are &quot;Les Visiteurs&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Enquète corse&quot;.

In other media, Reno was involved in the production of the third installment in the popular Capcom series &quot;Onimusha&quot; (&quot;Onimusha 3: Demon Siege&quot;), lending his likeness to the protagonist Jacques Blanc, as well as providing the voice for the character&#x27;s French dialogue. In advertising work, Reno has appeared in American television commercials for UPS and portrayed Doraemon in a series of Toyota ads in Japan, as part of the &quot;ReBorn&quot; campaign. He also starred as &quot;Jo&quot; in the 2013 English-language TV series &quot;Jo&quot;.

In 2024, Reno released his first novel, &quot;Emma&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Reno married his first wife, Geneviève, in 1977; they divorced in 1988. Reno married his second wife, Polish model Nathalie Dyszkiewicz, in 1995. They divorced in 2001. On 29 July 2006, Reno married for the third time, to a British model and actress of Polish descent, Zofia Borucka, at the Les Baux-de-Provence city hall. The presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy served as his best man (Reno endorsed Sarkozy for the 2007 French presidential election). Reno has six children, two from each marriage.

Reno maintains three homes in Paris, Malaysia, and Los Angeles. He is a dual citizen of France and Spain. In a 2016 interview, Reno stated &quot;his roots are above all Spanish, Andalusian.&quot;
