<text>The Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOP) comprises the offices and agencies that support the work of the president at the center of the executive branch of the United States federal government. The office consists of several offices and agencies, such as the White House Office (the staff working closest with the president, including West Wing staff), the National Security Council, Homeland Security Council, Office of Management and Budget, Council of Economic Advisers, and others. The Eisenhower Executive Office Building houses most staff.

The office is also referred to as a &quot;permanent government&quot;, since many policy programs, and the people who are charged with implementing them, continue between presidential administrations.

The civil servants who work in the Executive Office of the President are regarded as nonpartisan and politically neutral, so they are capable of providing objective and impartial advice.

With the increase in technological and global advancement, the size of the White House staff has increased to include an array of policy experts responsible with managing various federal governmental functions and policy areas. As of 2015, it included approximately 1,800 positions, most of which did not require confirmation from the U.S. Senate.

The office is overseen by the White House chief of staff. Since January 20 2025, that position has been held by Susie Wiles, who was appointed by President Donald Trump.

==History==

In 1937, the Brownlow Committee, which was a presidentially commissioned panel of political science and public administration experts, recommended sweeping changes to the executive branch of the U.S. federal government, including the creation of the Executive Office of the President. Based on these recommendations, President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939 lobbied Congress to approve the Reorganization Act of 1939. The Act led to Reorganization Plan No. 1, which created the office, which reported directly to the president.

The office encompassed two subunits at its outset, the White House Office (WHO) and the Bureau of the Budget, the predecessor to today&#x27;s Office of Management and Budget, which was created in 1921 and originally located in the Treasury Department. It absorbed most of the functions of the National Emergency Council. Initially, the new staff system appeared more ambitious on paper than in practice; the increase in the size of the staff was quite modest at the start. However, it laid the groundwork for the large and organizationally complex White House staff that emerged during the presidencies of Roosevelt&#x27;s successors.

Roosevelt&#x27;s efforts are also notable in contrast to those of his predecessors in office. During the 19th century, presidents had few staff resources. Thomas Jefferson had one messenger and one secretary at his disposal, both of whose salaries were paid by the president personally. It was not until 1857 that Congress appropriated money ($2,500) for the hiring of one clerk.

By Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s presidency (1869–1877), the staff had grown to three. By 1900, the White House staff included one &quot;secretary to the president&quot; (then the title of the president&#x27;s chief aide), two assistant secretaries, two executive clerks, a stenographer, and seven other office personnel. Under Warren G. Harding, there were thirty-one staff, although most were in clerical positions.

During Herbert Hoover&#x27;s presidency, two additional secretaries to the president were added by Congress, one of whom Hoover designated as his press secretary. From 1933 to 1939, as he greatly expanded the scope of the federal government&#x27;s policies and powers in response to the Great Depression, Roosevelt relied on his &quot;brain trust&quot; of top advisers, who were often appointed to vacant positions in agencies and departments, from which they drew their salaries since the White House lacked statutory or budgetary authority to create new staff positions.

After World War II, in particular, during the Eisenhower presidency, the staff was expanded and reorganized. Eisenhower, a former U.S. Army general, had been Supreme Allied Commander during the war and reorganized the Executive Office to suit his leadership style.

As of 2009, the staff is much bigger. Estimates indicate some 3,000 to 4,000 persons serve in office staff positions with policy-making responsibilities, with a budget of $300 to $400 million (George W. Bush&#x27;s budget request for Fiscal Year 2005 was for $341 million in support of 1,850 personnel).

Some observers have noted a problem of control for the president due to the increase in staff and departments, making coordination and cooperation between the various departments of the Executive Office more difficult.

==Organization==

The president had the power to reorganize the Executive Office due to the 1949 Reorganization Act which gave the president considerable discretion, until 1983 when it was renewed due to President Reagan&#x27;s administration allegedly encountering &quot;disloyalty and obstruction&quot;.

The chief of staff is the head of the Executive Office and can therefore ultimately decide what the president needs to deal with personally and what can be dealt with by other staff.

Senior staff within the Executive Office of the President have the title Assistant to the President, second-level staff have the title Deputy Assistant to the President, and third-level staff have the title Special Assistant to the President.

The core White House staff appointments, and most Executive Office officials generally, are not required to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, although there are a handful of exceptions (e.g., the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, and the United States Trade Representative).

The information in the following table is current as of January 20, 2025. Only principal executives are listed; for subordinate officers, see individual office pages.

== Congress ==
Congress as well as the president has some control over the Executive Office of the President. Some of this authority stems from its appropriation powers given by the Constitution, such as the &quot;power of the purse&quot;, which affects the Office of Management and Budget and the funding of the rest of federal departments and agencies. Congress also has the right to investigate the operation of the Executive Office, normally holding hearings bringing forward individual personnel to testify before a congressional committee.

The Executive Office often helps with legislation by filling in specific points understood and written by experts, as Congressional legislation sometimes starts in broad terms.

<text>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is the largest office within the Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOP). OMB&#x27;s most prominent function is to produce the president&#x27;s budget, but it also examines agency programs, policies, and procedures to see whether they comply with the president&#x27;s policies and coordinates inter-agency policy initiatives.

Russell Vought is the current director of the OMB since February 2025.

==History==

The Bureau of the Budget, OMB&#x27;s predecessor, was established in 1921 as a part of the Department of the Treasury by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, which President Warren G. Harding signed into law. The Bureau of the Budget was moved to the Executive Office of the President in 1939 and was run by Harold D. Smith during the government&#x27;s rapid expansion of spending during World War II. James L. Sundquist, a staffer at the Bureau of the Budget, called the relationship between the president and the bureau extremely close and subsequent bureau directors have been politicians, not public administrators.

The bureau was reorganized into the Office of Management and Budget in 1970 during the Nixon administration. The first OMB included Roy Ash (head), Paul O&#x27;Neill (assistant director), Fred Malek (deputy director), Frank Zarb (associate director) and two dozen others.

In the 1990s, OMB was reorganized to remove the distinction between management staff and budgetary staff by combining the dual roles into each given program examiner within the Resource Management Offices.

==Purpose==
OMB prepares the president&#x27;s budget proposal to Congress and supervises the administration of the executive branch agencies. It evaluates the effectiveness of agency programs, policies, and procedures, assesses competing funding demands among agencies, and sets funding priorities. OMB ensures that agency reports, rules, testimony, and proposed legislation are consistent with the president&#x27;s budget and administration policies.

OMB also oversees and coordinates the administration&#x27;s procurement, financial management, information, and regulatory policies. In each of these areas, OMB&#x27;s role is to help improve administrative management, develop better performance measures and coordinating mechanisms, and reduce unnecessary burdens on the public.

OMB&#x27;s critical missions are:

#Budget development and execution, a prominent government-wide process managed by the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and a device by which a president implements their policies, priorities, and actions in everything from the Department of Defense to NASA.
#Managing other agencies&#x27; financials, paperwork, and IT.

==Structure==
===Overview===
OMB is made up mainly of career appointed staff who provide continuity across changes of party and administration in the White House. Six positions within OMBthe Director, the Deputy Director, the Deputy Director for Management, and the administrators of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, and the Office of Federal Financial Managementare presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed positions.

OMB&#x27;s largest components are the five Resource Management Offices, which are organized along functional lines mirroring the federal government, each led by an OMB associate director. Approximately half of all OMB staff are assigned to these offices, the majority of whom are designated as program examiners. Program examiners can be assigned to monitor one or more federal agencies or may be deployed by a topical area, such as monitoring issues relating to U.S. Navy warships. These staff have dual responsibility for both management and budgetary issues, as well as for giving expert advice on all aspects relating to their programs. Each year they review federal agency budget requests and help decide what resource requests will be sent to Congress as part of the president&#x27;s budget. They perform in-depth program evaluations with the Program Assessment Rating Tool, review proposed regulations and agency testimony, analyze pending legislation, and oversee the aspects of the president&#x27;s management agenda including agency management scorecards. They are often called upon to provide analysis information to EOP staff. They also provide important information to those assigned to the statutory offices within OMB: the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the Office of Federal Financial Management, and the Office of E-Government &amp; Information Technology, which specializes in issues such as federal regulations and procurement policy and law.

Other components are OMB-wide support offices, including the Office of General Counsel, the Office of Legislative Affairs, the Budget Review Division (BRD), and the Legislative Reference Division. The BRD performs government-wide budget coordination and is largely responsible for the technical aspects relating to the release of the president&#x27;s budget each February. With respect to the estimation of spending for the executive branch, the BRD serves a purpose parallel to that of the Congressional Budget Office (which was created in response to the OMB) for estimating Congressional spending, the Department of the Treasury for estimating executive branch revenue, and the Joint Committee on Taxation for estimating Congressional revenue.

The Legislative Reference Division is the federal government&#x27;s central clearing house for proposed legislation or testimony by federal officials. It distributes proposed legislation and testimony to all relevant federal reviewers and distills the comments into a consensus opinion of the administration about the proposal. It is also responsible for writing an Enrolled Bill Memorandum to the president once a bill is presented by both chambers of Congress for the president&#x27;s signature. The Enrolled Bill Memorandum details the bill&#x27;s particulars, opinions on the bill from relevant federal departments, and an overall opinion about whether it should be signed into law or vetoed. It also issues Statements of Administration Policy that let Congress know the White House&#x27;s official position on proposed legislation.

===Role in the executive budget process===
In practice, the president has assigned the OMB certain responsibilities when it comes to the budget and hiring authorities who play key roles in developing it. OMB coordinates the development of the president&#x27;s budget proposal by issuing circulars, memoranda, and guidance documents to the heads of executive agencies. The OMB works very closely with executive agencies in making sure the budget process and proposal is smooth.

The development of the budget within the executive branch has many steps and takes nearly a year to complete. The first step is the OMB informing the president of the country&#x27;s economic situation. The next step is known as the Spring Guidance: the OMB gives executive agencies instructions on policy guidance to use when coming up with their budget requests along with due dates for them to submit their requests. The OMB then works with the agencies to discuss issues in the upcoming budget. In July, the OMB issues circular A-11 to all agencies, which outlines instructions for submitting the budget proposals, which the agencies submit by September. The fiscal year begins October1 and OMB staff meet with senior agency representatives to find out whether their proposals are in line with the president&#x27;s priorities and policies and identify constraints within the budget proposal until late November. The OMB director then meets with the president and EOP advisors to discuss the agencies&#x27; budget proposals and recommends a federal budget proposal, and the agencies are notified of the decisions about their requests. They can appeal to OMB and the president in December if they are dissatisfied with the decisions. After working together to resolve issues, agencies and OMB prepare a budget justification document to present to relevant congressional committees, especially the Appropriations Committee. Finally, by the first Monday in February, the president must review and submit the final budget to Congress to approve.

OMB is also responsible for the preparation of Statements of Administrative Policy (SAPs) with the president. These statements allow the OMB to communicate the president&#x27;s and agencies&#x27; policies to the government as a whole and set forth policymakers&#x27; agendas. During the review of the federal budget, interest groups can lobby for policy change and affect the budget for the new year. OMB plays a key role in policy conflicts by making sure legislation and agencies&#x27; actions are consistent with the executive branch&#x27;s. OMB has a powerful and influential role in the government, basically making sure its day-to-day operations run. Without a budget, federal employees could not be paid, federal buildings could not open and federal programs would come to a halt in a government shutdown. Shutdowns can occur when Congress refuses to pass a budget.

===Suspension and debarment===
The Interagency Suspension and Debarment Committee (ISDC) was created as an OMB committee by President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Executive Order 12549 in 1986, for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of the order. This order mandates executive departments and agencies to:
*participate in a government-wide suspension and debarment system,
*issue regulations with government-wide criteria and minimum due process procedures when debarring or suspending participants, and
*send debarred and suspended participants&#x27; identifying information to the General Services Administration for inclusion on a list of excluded persons, now known as the System for Award Management (SAM).

===Circulars===

Circulars are instructions or information the OMB issues to federal agencies that are indexed by major category: Budget, State and Local Governments, Educational and Non-Profit Institutions, Federal Procurement, Federal Financial Management, Federal Information Resources / Data Collection and Other Special Purpose.

Circular NO. A-119
Circular A-119 is for federal participation in the development and use of voluntary consensus standards and in conformity assessment activities. A-119 instructs its agencies to adopt voluntary consensus standards before relying upon industry standards and reducing to a minimum the reliance by agencies on government standards. Adoption of international standards is widely followed by U.S. agencies. This includes:
* Environmental Protection Agency referencing ISO 14001 supporting public policy in environmental management
* Department of Energy referencing ISO 50001 supporting public policy for energy performance aligned with the International Energy Agency
* Department of Labor referencing ISO 45001 supporting public policy in occupational health and safety
* Food and Drug Administration referencing ISO 13485 supporting public policy in medical devices
* Food and Drug Administration referencing ISO 22000 supporting public policy in food products

<text>In graph theory, a perfect matching in a graph is a matching that covers every vertex of the graph. More formally, given a graph with edges and vertices , a perfect matching in is a subset of , such that every vertex in is adjacent to exactly one edge in . The adjacency matrix of a perfect matching is a symmetric permutation matrix.

A perfect matching is also called a 1-factor; see Graph factorization for an explanation of this term. In some literature, the term complete matching is used. 

Every perfect matching is a maximum-cardinality matching, but the opposite is not true. For example, consider the following graphs:

In graph (b) there is a perfect matching (of size 3) since all 6 vertices are matched; in graphs (a) and (c) there is a maximum-cardinality matching (of size 2) which is not perfect, since some vertices are unmatched.

A perfect matching is also a minimum-size edge cover. If there is a perfect matching, then both the matching number and the edge cover number equal . 

A perfect matching can only occur when the graph has an even number of vertices. A near-perfect matching is one in which exactly one vertex is unmatched. This can only occur when the graph has an odd number of vertices, and such a matching must be maximum. In the above figure, part (c) shows a near-perfect matching. If, for every vertex in a graph, there is a near-perfect matching that omits only that vertex, the graph is also called factor-critical.

== Characterizations ==
Hall&#x27;s marriage theorem provides a characterization of bipartite graphs which have a perfect matching.

The Tutte theorem provides a characterization for arbitrary graphs.

A perfect matching is a spanning 1-regular subgraph, a.k.a. a 1-factor. In general, a spanning &quot;k&quot;-regular subgraph is a &quot;k&quot;-factor.

A spectral characterization for a graph to have a perfect matching is given by Hassani Monfared and Mallik as follows: Let formula_1 be a graph on even formula_2 vertices and formula_3 be formula_4 distinct nonzero purely imaginary numbers. Then formula_1 has a perfect matching if and only if there is a real skew-symmetric matrix formula_6 with graph formula_1 and eigenvalues formula_8. Note that the (simple) graph of a real symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix formula_6 of order formula_2 has formula_2 vertices and edges given by the nonzero off-diagonal entries of formula_6.

== Computation ==
Deciding whether a graph admits a perfect matching can be done in polynomial time, using any algorithm for finding a maximum cardinality matching.

However, counting the number of perfect matchings, even in bipartite graphs, is #P-complete. This is because computing the permanent of an arbitrary 0–1 matrix (another #P-complete problem) is the same as computing the number of perfect matchings in the bipartite graph having the given matrix as its biadjacency matrix. 

A theorem of Pieter Kasteleyn states that the number of perfect matchings in a planar graph can be computed exactly in polynomial time via the FKT algorithm.

The number of perfect matchings in a complete graph &quot;Kn&quot; (with &quot;n&quot; even) is given by the double factorial: formula_13

== Connection to Graph Coloring ==
An edge-colored graph can induce a number of (not necessarily proper) vertex colorings equal to the number of perfect matchings, as every vertex is covered exactly once in each matching. This property has been investigated in quantum physics and computational complexity theory.

== Perfect matching polytope ==

The perfect matching polytope of a graph is a polytope in R|E| in which each corner is an incidence vector of a perfect matching.

<text>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) (stylized as cpb) is an American publicly funded non-profit corporation, created in 1967 to promote and help support public broadcasting. The corporation&#x27;s mission is to ensure universal access to non-commercial, high-quality content and telecommunications services. It does so by distributing more than 70 percent of its funding to more than 1,400 locally owned public radio and television stations.

==History==
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created on November 7, 1967, when U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. The new organization initially collaborated with the National Educational Television network—which would be replaced by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Ward Chamberlin Jr. was the first operating officer. On March 27, 1968, it was registered as a nonprofit corporation in the District of Columbia. In 1969, the CPB talked to private groups to start PBS, an entity intended by the CPB to circumvent controversies engendered by certain NET public affairs programs that aired in the late 1960s and engendered opposition by politically conservative public figures, potentially threatening the medium&#x27;s future viability.

On February 26, 1970, the CPB formed National Public Radio (NPR), a network of public-radio stations that began operating the following year. Unlike PBS, NPR produces &quot;and&quot; distributes programming. On May 31, 2002, the CPB, through special appropriation funding, helped public television stations making the transition to digital broadcasting; this was complete by 2009.

==Funding of and by the corporation==
The CPB&#x27;s annual budget is composed almost entirely of an annual appropriation from Congress plus interest on those funds.
CPB has claimed that 95% of its appropriation goes directly to content development, community services, and other local station and system needs.

, its appropriation was US$535 million, including $10 million in interest earned. The distribution of these funds was as follows:

* $267.83M for direct grants to local public television stations;
* $96.78M for television programming grants;
* $83.33M for direct grants to local public radio stations;
* $28.63M for the Radio National Program Production and Acquisition
* $9.58M for the Radio Program Fund
* $32.10M for system support
* $26.75M for administration

Public broadcasting stations are funded by a combination of private donations from listeners and viewers, foundations and corporations. Funding for public television comes in roughly equal parts from government (at all levels) and the private sector.

Stations that receive CPB funds must meet certain requirements, such as the maintenance or provision of open meetings, open financial records, a community advisory board, equal employment opportunity, and lists of donors and political activities.

== Efforts to defund CPB in the US Congress == 
The CPB has had its congressional funding threatened a number of times, mostly by Republicans who allege a left-wing bias in PBS. President Nixon was well known for his dislike of PBS and the CPB and wanted to kill the congressional funding for it. In July 2023, the appropriations bill for FY 2024 included &quot;zero&quot; money for CPB when it passed out of the US House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies However, the corresponding bill considered by the Senate Appropriations Committee plans to continue funding for the CPB, though at 7 percent less than what President Biden requested.

==Board composition==
The CPB is governed by a nine-member board of directors selected by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate; they serve six-year terms, and are allowed to continue serving until the end of the calendar year that their term ends or until their successor is seated on the board. Under the terms of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, the president cannot appoint persons of the same political party to more than five of the nine CPB board seats.

The Board of Directors governs the CPB, sets policy, and establishes programming priorities. The Board appoints the president and chief executive officer, who then names the other corporate officers.

===Board members===
The current CPB board :
==Political concerns==
In 2004 and 2005, people from PBS and NPR complained that the CPB was starting to push a conservative agenda. Board members replied that they were merely seeking balance.

Kenneth Tomlinson, chair of the CPB board from September 2003 until September 2005, angered PBS and NPR supporters by unilaterally commissioning a conservative colleague to conduct a study of alleged bias in the PBS show &quot;NOW with Bill Moyers&quot;, and by appointing two conservatives as CPB Ombudsmen. On November 3, 2005, Tomlinson resigned from the board, prompted by a report of his tenure by the CPB Inspector General, Kenneth Konz, requested by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The report was made public on November 15. It states:

We found evidence that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) former Chairman violated statutory provisions and the Director&#x27;s Code of Ethics by dealing directly with one of the creators of a new public affairs program during negotiations with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and the CPB over creating the show. Our review also found evidence that suggests &quot;political tests&quot; used by the former Chairman in recruiting a President/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for CPB, which violated statutory prohibitions against such practices.

==Objectivity and balance requirements==
The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 requires the CPB to operate with a &quot;strict adherence to objectivity and balance in all programs or series of programs of a controversial nature&quot;. It also requires it to regularly review national programming for objectivity and balance, and to report on &quot;its efforts to address concerns about objectivity and balance&quot;.

<text>The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War, often referred to in France as the War of 1870, was a conflict between the Second French Empire and the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. Lasting from 19 July 1870 to 28 January 1871, the conflict was caused primarily by France&#x27;s determination to reassert its dominant position in continental Europe, which appeared in question following the decisive Prussian victory over Austria in 1866. According to some historians, Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked the French into declaring war on Prussia in order to induce four independent southern German states—Baden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt—to join the North German Confederation. Other historians contend that Bismarck exploited the circumstances as they unfolded. All agree that Bismarck recognized the potential for new German alliances, given the situation as a whole.

France mobilised its army on 15 July 1870, leading the North German Confederation to respond with its own mobilisation later that day. On 16 July 1870, the French parliament voted to declare war on Prussia; France invaded German territory on 2 August. The German coalition mobilised its troops much more effectively than the French and invaded northeastern France on 4 August. German forces were superior in numbers, training, and leadership and made more effective use of modern technology, particularly railways and artillery.

A series of hard-fought Prussian and German victories in eastern France, culminating in the Siege of Metz and the Battle of Sedan, resulted in the capture of the French Emperor Napoleon III and the decisive defeat of the army of the Second Empire; a Government of National Defense was formed in Paris on 4 September and continued the war for another five months. German forces fought and defeated new French armies in northern France, then besieged Paris for over four months before it fell on 28 January 1871, effectively ending the war.

In the final days of the war, with German victory all but assured, the German states proclaimed their union as the German Empire under the Prussian king Wilhelm I and Chancellor Bismarck. With the notable exceptions of Austria and German Switzerland, the vast majority of German-speakers were united under a nation-state for the first time. Following an armistice with France, the Treaty of Frankfurt was signed on 10 May 1871, giving Germany billions of francs in war indemnity, as well as most of Alsace and parts of Lorraine, which became the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine ().

The war had a lasting impact on Europe. By hastening German unification, the war significantly altered the balance of power on the continent, with the new German state supplanting France as the dominant European land power. Bismarck maintained great authority in international affairs for two decades, developing a reputation for &quot;Realpolitik&quot; that raised Germany&#x27;s global stature and influence. In France, it brought a final end to imperial rule and began the first lasting republican government. Resentment over the French government&#x27;s handling of the war and its aftermath triggered the Paris Commune, a revolutionary uprising which seized and held power for two months before its suppression; the event would influence the politics and policies of the Third Republic.

==Causes==

The causes of the Franco-Prussian War are rooted in the events surrounding the lead up to the unification of the German states under Otto von Bismarck. France had gained the status of being the dominant power of continental Europe as a result of the Franco-Austrian War of 1859. During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the Empress Eugénie, Foreign Minister Drouyn de Lhuys and War Minister Jacques Louis Randon were concerned that the power of Prussia might overtake that of France. They unsuccessfully urged Napoleon to mass troops at France&#x27;s eastern borders while the bulk of the Prussian armies were still engaged in Bohemia as a warning that no territorial changes could be effected in Germany without consulting France.

As a result of Prussia&#x27;s annexation of several German states which had sided with Austria during the war and the formation of the North German Confederation under Prussia&#x27;s aegis, French public opinion stiffened and now demanded more firmness as well as territorial compensations. As a result, Napoleon demanded from Prussia a return to the French borders of 1814, with the annexation of Luxembourg, most of Saarland, and the Bavarian Palatinate. Bismarck flatly refused what he disdainfully termed France&#x27;s (&quot;tipping policy&quot;). He then communicated Napoleon III&#x27;s written territorial demands to Bavaria and the other southern German states of Württemberg, Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt, which hastened the conclusion of defensive military alliances with these states. France had been strongly opposed to any further alliance of German states, which would have threatened French continental dominance.

The only result of French policy was the consent of Prussia to nominal independence for Saxony, Bavaria, Wurttemberg, Baden, and Hessia-Darmstadt; this was a small victory, and one without appeal to a French public which wanted territory and a French army which wanted revenge. The situation did not suit either France, which unexpectedly found itself next to the militarily powerful Prussian-led North German Confederation, or Prussia, whose foremost objective was to complete the process of uniting the German states under its control. Thus, war between the two powers since 1866 was only a matter of time.

In Prussia, some officials considered a war against France both inevitable and necessary to arouse German nationalism in those states that would allow the unification of a great German empire. This aim was epitomized by Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s later statement: &quot;I did not doubt that a Franco-German war must take place before the construction of a United Germany could be realised.&quot; Bismarck also knew that France should be the aggressor in the conflict to bring the four southern German states to side with Prussia, hence giving Germans numerical superiority. He was convinced that France would not find any allies in her war against Germany for the simple reason that &quot;France, the victor, would be a danger to everybody—Prussia to nobody,&quot; and he added, &quot;That is our strong point.&quot; Many Germans also viewed the French as the traditional destabilizer of Europe, and sought to weaken France to prevent further breaches of the peace.

The immediate cause of the war was the candidacy of Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen to the throne of Spain. France feared an encirclement resulting from an alliance between Prussia and Spain. The Hohenzollern prince&#x27;s candidacy was withdrawn under French diplomatic pressure, but Otto von Bismarck goaded the French into declaring war by releasing an altered summary of the Ems Dispatch, a telegram sent by William I rejecting French demands that Prussia never again support a Hohenzollern candidacy. Bismarck&#x27;s summary, as mistranslated by the French press Havas, made it sound as if the king had treated the French envoy in a demeaning fashion, which inflamed public opinion in France.

French historians François Roth and Pierre Milza argue that Napoleon III was pressured by a bellicose press and public opinion and thus sought war in response to France&#x27;s diplomatic failures to obtain any territorial gains following the Austro-Prussian War. Napoleon III believed he would win a conflict with Prussia. Many in his court, such as Empress Eugénie, also wanted a victorious war to resolve growing domestic political problems, restore France as the undisputed leading power in Europe, and ensure the long-term survival of the House of Bonaparte. A national plebiscite held on 8 May 1870, which returned results overwhelmingly in favor of the Emperor&#x27;s domestic agenda gave the impression that the regime was politically popular and in a position to confront Prussia. Within days of the plebiscite, France&#x27;s pacifist Foreign Minister Napoléon, comte Daru, was replaced by Agenor, duc de Gramont, a fierce opponent of Prussia who, as French Ambassador to Austria in 1866, had advocated an Austro-French military alliance against Prussia. Napoleon III&#x27;s worsening health problems made him less and less capable of reining in Empress Eugénie, Gramont and the other members of the war party, known collectively as the &quot;mameluks&quot;. For Bismarck, the nomination of Gramont was seen as &quot;a highly bellicose symptom&quot;.

The Ems telegram of 13 July 1870 had exactly the effect on French public opinion that Bismarck had intended. &quot;This text produced the effect of a red flag on the Gallic bull”, Bismarck later wrote. Gramont, the French foreign minister, declared that he felt &quot;he had just received a slap&quot;. The leader of the monarchists in Parliament, Adolphe Thiers, spoke for moderation, arguing that France had won the diplomatic battle and there was no reason for war, but he was drowned out by cries that he was a traitor and a Prussian. Napoleon&#x27;s new prime minister, Emile Ollivier, declared that France had done all that it could humanly and honorably do to prevent the war, and that he accepted the responsibility &quot;with a light heart&quot;. A crowd of 15,000–20,000 people, carrying flags and patriotic banners, marched through the streets of Paris, demanding war. French mobilization was ordered early on 15 July. Upon receiving news of the French mobilization, the North German Confederation mobilized on the night of 15–16 July, while Bavaria and Baden did likewise on 16 July and Württemberg on 17 July. On 19 July 1870, the French sent a declaration of war to the Prussian government. The southern German states immediately sided with Prussia.

Napoleonic France had no documented alliance with other powers and entered the war virtually without allies. The calculation was for a victorious offensive, which, as the French Foreign Minister Gramont stated, was &quot;the only way for France to lure the wary Austrians, Italians and Danes into the French alliance&quot;. The involvement of Russia on the side of France was not considered by her at all, since Russia made the lifting of restrictions on its naval construction on the Black Sea imposed on Russia by the Treaty of Paris following the Crimean War a precondition for the union. But Imperial France was not ready to do this. &quot;Bonaparte did not dare to encroach on the Paris Treaty: the worse things turned out in the present, the more precious the heritage of the past became&quot;.

==Opposing forces==
===French===

The French Army consisted in peacetime of approximately 426,000 soldiers, some of them regulars, others conscripts who until March 1869 were selected by ballot and served for the comparatively long period of seven years. Some of them were veterans of previous French campaigns in the Crimean War, Algeria, the Franco-Austrian War in Italy, and in the Mexican campaign. However, following the &quot;Seven Weeks War&quot; between Prussia and Austria four years earlier, it had been calculated that, with commitments in Algeria and elsewhere, the French Army could field only 288,000 men to face the Prussian Army, when potentially 1,000,000 would be required. Under Marshal Adolphe Niel, urgent reforms were made. Universal conscription and a shorter period of service gave increased numbers of reservists, who would swell the army to a planned strength of 800,000 on mobilisation. Those who for any reason were not conscripted were to be enrolled in the &quot;Garde Mobile&quot;, a militia with a nominal strength of 400,000. However, the Franco-Prussian War broke out before these reforms could be completely implemented. The mobilisation of reservists was chaotic and resulted in large numbers of stragglers, while the &quot;Garde Mobile&quot; were generally untrained and often mutinous.

French infantry were equipped with the breech-loading Chassepot rifle, one of the most modern mass-produced firearms in the world at the time, with 1,037,555 available in French inventories. With a rubber ring seal and a smaller bullet, the Chassepot had a maximum effective range of some with a short reloading time. French tactics emphasised the defensive use of the Chassepot rifle in trench-warfare style fighting—the so-called &quot;feu de bataillon&quot;. The artillery was equipped with rifled, muzzle-loaded La Hitte guns. The army also possessed a precursor to the machine-gun: the mitrailleuse, which could unleash significant, concentrated firepower but nevertheless lacked range and was comparatively immobile, and thus prone to being easily overrun. The mitrailleuse was mounted on an artillery gun carriage and grouped in batteries in a similar fashion to cannon.

The army was nominally led by Napoleon III, with Marshals François Achille Bazaine and Patrice de MacMahon in command of the field armies. However, there was no previously arranged plan of campaign in place. The only campaign plan prepared between 1866 and 1870 was a defensive one.

===Prussians/Germans===

The German army comprised that of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia, and the South German states drawn in under the secret clause of the preliminary peace of Nikolsburg, 26 July 1866, and formalised in the Treaty of Prague, 23 August 1866.

Recruitment and organisation of the various armies were almost identical, and based on the concept of conscripting annual classes of men who then served in the regular regiments for a fixed term before being moved to the reserves. This process gave a theoretical peace time strength of 382,000 and a wartime strength of about 1,189,000.

German tactics emphasised encirclement battles like Cannae and using artillery offensively whenever possible. Rather than advancing in a column or line formation, Prussian infantry moved in small groups that were harder to target by artillery or French defensive fire. The sheer number of soldiers available made encirclement &quot;en masse&quot; and destruction of French formations relatively easy.

The army was equipped with the Dreyse needle gun renowned for its use at the Battle of Königgrätz, which was by this time showing the age of its 25-year-old design. The rifle had a range of only and lacked the rubber breech seal that permitted aimed shots. The deficiencies of the needle gun were more than compensated for by the famous Krupp 6-pounder (6 kg despite the gun being called a 6-pounder, the rifling technology enabled guns to fire twice the weight of projectiles in the same calibre) steel breech-loading cannons being issued to Prussian artillery batteries. Firing a contact-detonated shell, the Krupp gun had a longer range and a higher rate of fire than the French bronze muzzle loading cannon, which relied on time fuses.

The Prussian army was controlled by the General Staff, under General Helmuth von Moltke. The Prussian army was unique in Europe for having the only such organisation in existence, whose purpose in peacetime was to prepare the overall war strategy, and in wartime to direct operational movement and organise logistics and communications. The officers of the General Staff were hand-picked from the Prussian &quot;Kriegsakademie&quot; (War Academy). Moltke embraced new technology, particularly the railroad and telegraph, to coordinate and accelerate mobilisation of large forces.

==French Army incursion==

===Preparations for the offensive===

On 28 July 1870 Napoleon III left Paris for Metz and assumed command of the newly titled Army of the Rhine, some 202,448 strong and expected to grow as the French mobilization progressed. Marshal MacMahon took command of I Corps (4 infantry divisions) near Wissembourg; Marshal François Canrobert brought VI Corps (4 infantry divisions) to Châlons-sur-Marne in northern France as a reserve and to guard against a Prussian advance through Belgium.

A pre-war plan laid down by the late Marshal Niel called for a strong French offensive from Thionville towards Trier and into the Prussian Rhineland. This plan was discarded in favour of a defensive plan by Generals Charles Frossard and Bartélemy Lebrun, which called for the Army of the Rhine to remain in a defensive posture near the German border and repel any Prussian offensive. As Austria, along with Bavaria, Württemberg, and Baden were expected to join in a revenge war against Prussia, I Corps would invade the Bavarian Palatinate and proceed to &quot;free&quot; the four South German states in concert with Austro-Hungarian forces. VI Corps would reinforce either army as needed.

Unfortunately for Frossard&#x27;s plan, the Prussian army mobilised far more rapidly than expected. The Austro-Hungarians, still reeling after their defeat by Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War, were treading carefully before stating that they would only side with France if the south Germans viewed the French positively. This did not materialize as the four South German states had come to Prussia&#x27;s aid and were mobilizing their armies against France.

===Occupation of Saarbrücken===
Napoleon III was under substantial domestic pressure to launch an offensive before the full might of Moltke&#x27;s forces was mobilized and deployed. Reconnaissance by Frossard&#x27;s forces had identified only the Prussian 16th Infantry Division guarding the border town of Saarbrücken, right before the entire Army of the Rhine. Accordingly, on 31 July the Army marched forward toward the Saar River to seize Saarbrücken.

General Frossard&#x27;s II Corps and Marshal Bazaine&#x27;s III Corps crossed the German border on 2 August, and began to force the Prussian 40th Regiment of the 16th Infantry Division from the town of Saarbrücken with a series of direct attacks. The Chassepot rifle proved its worth against the Dreyse rifle, with French riflemen regularly outdistancing their Prussian counterparts in the skirmishing around Saarbrücken. However the Prussians resisted strongly, and the French suffered 86 casualties to the Prussian 83 casualties. Saarbrücken also proved to be a major obstacle in terms of logistics. Only one railway there led to the German hinterland but could be easily defended by a single force, and the only river systems in the region ran along the border instead of inland. While the French hailed the invasion as the first step towards the Rhineland and later Berlin, General Edmond Le Bœuf and Napoleon III were receiving alarming reports from foreign news sources of Prussian and Bavarian armies massing to the southeast in addition to the forces to the north and northeast.

Moltke had indeed massed three armies in the area—the Prussian First Army with 50,000 men, commanded by General Karl von Steinmetz opposite Saarlouis, the Prussian Second Army with 134,000 men commanded by Prince Friedrich Karl opposite the line Forbach-Spicheren, and the Prussian Third Army with 120,000 men commanded by Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, poised to cross the border at Wissembourg.

==Prussian Army advance==

===Battle of Wissembourg===


Upon learning from captured Prussian soldiers and a local area police chief that the Prussian Crown Prince&#x27;s Third Army was just north from Saarbrücken near the Rhine river town Wissembourg, General Le Bœuf and Napoleon III decided to retreat to defensive positions. General Frossard, without instructions, hastily withdrew his elements of the Army of the Rhine in Saarbrücken back across the river to Spicheren and Forbach.

Marshal MacMahon, now closest to Wissembourg, spread his four divisions to react to any Prussian-Bavarian invasion. This organization was due to a lack of supplies, forcing each division to seek out food and forage from the countryside and from the representatives of the army supply arm that was supposed to furnish them with provisions. What made a bad situation much worse was the conduct of General Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot, commander of the 1st Division. He told General Abel Douay, commander of the 2nd Division, on 1 August that &quot;The information I have received makes me suppose that the enemy has no considerable forces very near his advance posts, and has no desire to take the offensive&quot;. Two days later, he told MacMahon that he had not found &quot;a single enemy post ... it looks to me as if the menace of the Bavarians is simply bluff&quot;. Even though Ducrot shrugged off the possibility of an attack by the Germans, MacMahon tried to warn his other three division commanders, without success.

The first action of the Franco-Prussian War took place on 4 August 1870. This battle saw the unsupported division of General Douay of I Corps, with some attached cavalry, which was posted to watch the border, attacked in overwhelming but uncoordinated fashion by the German 3rd Army. During the day, elements of a Bavarian and two Prussian corps became engaged and were aided by Prussian artillery, which blasted holes in the city defenses. Douay held a very strong position initially, thanks to the accurate long-range rapid fire of the Chassepot rifles, but his force was too thinly stretched to hold it. Douay was killed in the late morning when a caisson of the divisional mitrailleuse battery exploded near him; the encirclement of the town by the Prussians then threatened the French avenue of retreat.

The fighting within the town had become extremely intense, becoming a door to door battle of survival. Despite an unceasing attack from Prussian infantry, the soldiers of the 2nd Division kept to their positions. The people of the town of Wissembourg finally surrendered to the Germans. The French troops who did not surrender retreated westward, leaving behind and wounded and another and all of their remaining ammunition. The final attack by the Prussian troops also cost The German cavalry then failed to pursue the French and lost touch with them. The attackers had an initial superiority of numbers, a broad deployment which made envelopment highly likely but the effectiveness of French Chassepot-rifle fire inflicted costly repulses on infantry attacks, until the French infantry had been extensively bombarded by the Prussian artillery.

===Battle of Spicheren===

The Battle of Spicheren on 5 August was the second of three critical French defeats. Moltke had originally planned to keep Bazaine&#x27;s army on the Saar River until he could attack it with the 2nd Army in front and the 1st Army on its left flank, while the 3rd Army closed towards the rear. The aging General von Steinmetz made an overzealous, unplanned move, leading the 1st Army south from his position on the Moselle. He moved straight toward the town of Spicheren, cutting off Prince Frederick Charles from his forward cavalry units in the process.

On the French side, planning after the disaster at Wissembourg had become essential. General Le Bœuf, flushed with anger, was intent upon going on the offensive over the Saar and countering their loss. However, planning for the next encounter was more based upon the reality of unfolding events rather than emotion or pride, as Intendant General Wolff told him and his staff that supply beyond the Saar would be impossible. Therefore, the armies of France would take up a defensive position that would protect against every possible attack point, but also left the armies unable to support each other.

While the French army under General MacMahon engaged the German 3rd Army at the Battle of Wörth, the German 1st Army under Steinmetz finished their advance west from Saarbrücken. A patrol from the German 2nd Army under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia spotted decoy fires nearby and Frossard&#x27;s army farther off on a distant plateau south of the town of Spicheren, and took this as a sign of Frossard&#x27;s retreat. Ignoring Moltke&#x27;s plan again, both German armies attacked Frossard&#x27;s French 2nd Corps, fortified between Spicheren and Forbach.

The French were unaware of German numerical superiority at the beginning of the battle as the German 2nd Army did not attack all at once. Treating the oncoming attacks as merely skirmishes, Frossard did not request additional support from other units. By the time he realized what kind of a force he was opposing, it was too late. Seriously flawed communications between Frossard and those in reserve under Bazaine slowed down so much that by the time the reserves received orders to move out to Spicheren, German soldiers from the 1st and 2nd armies had charged up the heights. Because the reserves had not arrived, Frossard erroneously believed that he was in grave danger of being outflanked, as German soldiers under General von Glume were spotted in Forbach. Instead of continuing to defend the heights, by the close of battle after dusk he retreated to the south. The German casualties were relatively high due to the advance and the effectiveness of the Chassepot rifle. They were quite startled in the morning when they had found out that their efforts were not in vain—Frossard had abandoned his position on the heights.

===Battle of Wörth===

The Battle of Wörth began when the two armies clashed again on 6 August near Wörth in the town of Frœschwiller, about from Wissembourg. The Crown Prince of Prussia&#x27;s 3rd army had, on the quick reaction of his Chief of Staff General von Blumenthal, drawn reinforcements which brought its strength up to 140,000 troops. The French had been slowly reinforced and their force numbered only 35,000. Although badly outnumbered, the French defended their position just outside Frœschwiller. By afternoon, the Germans had suffered or wounded and the French had lost a similar number of casualties and another taken prisoner, a loss of about 50%. The Germans captured Fröschwiller which sat on a hilltop in the centre of the French line. Having lost any hope for victory and facing a massacre, the French army disengaged and retreated in a westerly direction towards Bitche and Saverne, hoping to join French forces on the other side of the Vosges mountains. The German 3rd army did not pursue the French but remained in Alsace and moved slowly south, attacking and destroying the French garrisons in the vicinity.
===Battle of Mars-La-Tour===


About 160,000 French soldiers were besieged in the fortress of Metz following the defeats on the frontier. A retirement from Metz to link up with French forces at Châlons was ordered on 15 August and spotted by a Prussian cavalry patrol under Major Oskar von Blumenthal. Next day a grossly outnumbered Prussian force of 30,000 men of III Corps (of the 2nd Army) under General Constantin von Alvensleben, found the French Army near Vionville, east of Mars-la-Tour.

Despite odds of four to one, the III Corps launched a risky attack. The French were routed and the III Corps captured Vionville, blocking any further escape attempts to the west. Once blocked from retreat, the French in the fortress of Metz had no choice but to engage in a fight that would see the last major cavalry engagement in Western Europe. The battle soon erupted, and III Corps was shattered by incessant cavalry charges, losing over half its soldiers. The German Official History recorded and French casualties of 

On 16 August, the French had a chance to sweep away the key Prussian defense, and to escape. Two Prussian corps had attacked the French advance guard, thinking that it was the rearguard of the retreat of the French Army of the Meuse. Despite this misjudgment the two Prussian corps held the entire French army for the whole day. Outnumbered 5 to 1, the extraordinary élan of the Prussians prevailed over gross indecision by the French. The French had lost the opportunity to win a decisive victory.

=== Battle of Gravelotte ===

The Battle of Gravelotte, or Gravelotte–St. Privat (18 August), was the largest battle in the Franco-Prussian War. It was fought about west of Metz, where on the previous day, having intercepted the French army&#x27;s retreat to the west at the Battle of Mars-La-Tour, the Prussians were now closing in to complete the destruction of the French forces. The combined German forces, under Field Marshal Count Helmuth von Moltke, were the Prussian First and Second Armies of the North German Confederation numbering about 210 infantry battalions, 133 cavalry squadrons, and 732 artillery pieces totaling 188,332 officers and men. The French Army of the Rhine, commanded by Marshal François-Achille Bazaine, numbering about 183 infantry battalions, 104 cavalry squadrons, backed by 520 artillery pieces, totaling 112,800 officers and men, dug in along high ground with their southern left flank at the town of Rozérieulles, and their northern right flank at St. Privat.

On 18 August, the battle began when at 08:00 Moltke ordered the First and Second Armies to advance against the French positions. The French were dug in with trenches and rifle pits with their artillery and their mitrailleuses in concealed positions. Backed by artillery fire, Steinmetz&#x27;s VII and VIII Corps launched attacks across the Mance ravine, all of which were defeated by French rifle and mitrailleuse firepower, forcing the two German corps&#x27; to withdraw to Rezonville. The Prussian 1st Guards Infantry Division assaulted French-held St. Privat and was pinned down by French fire from rifle pits and trenches. The Second Army under Prince Frederick Charles used its artillery to pulverize the French position at St. Privat. His XII Corps took the town of Roncourt and helped the Guard conquer St. Privat, while Eduard von Fransecky&#x27;s II Corps advanced across the Mance ravine. The fighting died down at 22:00.

The next morning the French Army of the Rhine retreated to Metz where they were besieged and forced to surrender two months later. A grand total of 20,163 German troops were killed, wounded or missing in action during the August 18 battle. The French losses were 7,855 killed and wounded along with 4,420 prisoners of war (half of them were wounded) for a total of 12,275.

===Siege of Metz===


With the defeat of Marshal Bazaine&#x27;s Army of the Rhine at Gravelotte, the French retreated to Metz, where they were besieged by over 150,000 Prussian troops of the First and Second Armies. Further military operations on the part of the army under Bazaine&#x27;s command have drawn numerous criticisms from historians against its commander. It was later stated with derogatory irony that his occupation at that time was writing orders on hygiene and discipline, as well as playing dominoes. Bazaine&#x27;s surprising inactivity was a great relief to Moltke, who now had time to improve his lines around Metz and intensify the hunt for MacMahon.

At this time, Napoleon III and MacMahon formed the new French Army of Châlons to march on to Metz to rescue Bazaine. Napoleon III personally led the army with Marshal MacMahon in attendance. The Army of Châlons marched northeast towards the Belgian border to avoid the Prussians before striking south to link up with Bazaine. The Prussians took advantage of this maneuver to catch the French in a pincer grip. Moltke left the Prussian First and Second Armies besieging Metz, except three corps detached to form the Army of the Meuse under the Crown Prince of Saxony. With this army and the Prussian Third Army, Moltke marched northward and caught up with the French at Beaumont on 30 August. After a sharp fight in which they lost 5,000 men and 40 cannons, the French withdrew toward Sedan. Having reformed in the town, the Army of Châlons was immediately isolated by the converging Prussian armies. Napoleon III ordered the army to break out of the encirclement immediately. With MacMahon wounded on the previous day, General Auguste Ducrot took command of the French troops in the field.

===Battle of Sedan===


On 1 September 1870, the battle opened with the Army of Châlons, with 202 infantry battalions, 80 cavalry squadrons and 564 guns, attacking the surrounding Prussian Third and Meuse Armies totaling 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons and 774 guns. General Emmanuel Félix de Wimpffen, the commander of the French V Corps in reserve, hoped to launch a combined infantry and cavalry attack against the Prussian XI Corps. But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. The struggle in the conditions of encirclement turned out to be absolutely impossible for the French—their front was shot through with artillery fire from three sides. The French cavalry, commanded by General Margueritte, launched three desperate attacks on the nearby village of Floing where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated. Margueritte was mortally wounded leading the very first charge, dying 4 days later, and the two additional charges led to nothing but heavy losses. By the end of the day, with no hope of breaking out, Napoleon III called off the attacks. The French lost over 17,000 men, killed or wounded, with 21,000 captured. The Prussians reported their losses at 2,320 killed, 5,980 wounded and 700 captured or missing. By the next day, on 2 September, Napoleon III surrendered and was taken prisoner with 104,000 of his soldiers. It was an overwhelming victory for the Prussians, who had captured an entire French army and the leader of France. They subsequently paraded the defeated French army in view of the besieged army in Metz, which had an impact on the morale of the defenders. The defeat of the French at Sedan had decided the war in Prussia&#x27;s favour. One French army was now immobilised and besieged in the city of Metz, and nothing was preventing a Prussian invasion. This defeat was humiliating for the already morally defeated French army and opened the paveway for the Siege of Paris.

===Surrender of Metz===

Bazaine, a well-known Bonapartist, at this time allowed himself to be carried away by illusory plans for a political role in France. Unconventional military plans were put forth (by which the Germans would allow the army under Bazaine&#x27;s command to withdraw from the fortress of Metz to retreat to the south of France, where it would remain until the German armies captured Paris) which were to eliminate the political usurpers and make room for the legitimate imperial authorities with the support of Bazaine&#x27;s army. Even ignoring moral issues and potential public outcry, this plan seems completely unrealistic. Bismarck and Moltke answered Bazaine&#x27;s offer of &quot;cooperation&quot; against the &quot;republican menace&quot; with an indifferent shrug. The German press, undoubtedly at the instigation of Bismarck, widely covered this topic, and reported the details of Bazaine&#x27;s negotiations. The French press could only remain completely silent on this issue. With whom Bazaine negotiated still raises questions among historians. &quot;For a decade, the French were considered him (M. Edmond Regnier) a sinister figure, almost certainly an agent of Bismarck. They would have been more justified in thinking him a buffoon&quot;. Undoubtedly, the politically motivated actions of Commander Bazaine led to the passivity of the encircled army at Metz and contributed to the defeat of not only this army, but the country as a whole. Bazaine&#x27;s army surrendered on 26 October. 173,000 people surrendered, with the Prussians capturing the huge amount of military equipment located in Metz. After the war, Marshal Bazaine was convicted by a French military court.

==War of the Government of National Defence==

===Government of National Defence===

When news of Napoleon III&#x27;s surrender at Sedan arrived in Paris, the Second Empire was overthrown by a popular uprising. On 4 September, Jules Favre, Léon Gambetta, and General Louis-Jules Trochu proclaimed a provisional government called the Government of National Defence and a Third Republic. After the German victory at Sedan, most of the French standing army was either besieged in Metz or held prisoner by the Germans, who hoped for an armistice and an end to the war. Bismarck wanted an early peace but had difficulty finding a legitimate French authority with whom to negotiate. The Emperor was a captive and the Empress in exile, but there had been no abdication &quot;de jure&quot; and the army was still bound by an oath of allegiance to the defunct imperial regime; on the other hand, the Government of National Defence had no electoral mandate.

Prussia&#x27;s intention was to weaken the political position of France abroad. The defensive position of the new French authorities, who offered Germany an honorable peace and reimbursement of the costs of the war, was presented by Prussia as aggressive; they rejected the conditions put forward and demanded the annexation of the French provinces of Alsace and part of Lorraine. Bismarck was dangling the Emperor over the republic&#x27;s head, calling Napoleon III &quot;the legitimate ruler of France&quot; and dismissing Gambetta&#x27;s new republic as no more than &quot;un coup de parti&quot; (&quot;a partisan coup&quot;). This policy was to some extent successful; the European press discussed the legitimacy of the French authorities, and Prussia&#x27;s aggressive position was to some extent understood. Only the United States and Spain recognized the Government of National Defence immediately after the announcement; other countries refused to do this for some time.

The question of legitimacy is rather strange for France after the coup d&#x27;état of 1851, since Louis-Napoleon himself only overthrew the Second Republic and rose to the imperial throne by means of a coup d&#x27;état.

The Germans expected to negotiate an end to the war, but while the republican government was amenable to war reparations or ceding colonial territories in Africa or Southeast Asia, it would go no further. On behalf of the Government of National Defense, Favre declared on 6 September that France would not &quot;yield an inch of its territory nor a stone of its fortresses&quot;. The republic then renewed the declaration of war, called for recruits in all parts of the country, and pledged to drive the German troops out of France by a (&#x27;overwhelming attack&#x27;). The Germans continued the war, yet could not pin down any proper military opposition in their vicinity. As the bulk of the remaining French armies was digging in near Paris, the German leaders decided to put pressure upon their enemy by attacking there. By 15 September, German troops had reached the outskirts and Moltke issued the orders to surround the city. On 19 September, the Germans surrounded it and erected a blockade, as already established at Metz, completing the encirclement on 20 September. Bismarck met Favre on 18 September at the Château de Ferrières and demanded a frontier immune to a French war of revenge, which included Strasbourg, Alsace, and most of the Moselle department in Lorraine, of which Metz was the capital. In return for an armistice for the French to elect a National Assembly, Bismarck demanded the surrender of Strasbourg and the fortress city of Toul. To allow supplies into Paris, one of the perimeter forts had to be handed over. Favre was unaware that Bismarck&#x27;s real aim in making such extortionate demands was to establish a durable peace on Germany&#x27;s new western frontier, preferably by a peace with a friendly government, on terms acceptable to French public opinion. An impregnable military frontier was an inferior alternative to him, favoured only by the militant nationalists on the German side.

When the war had begun, European public opinion heavily favoured the Germans; many Italians attempted to sign up as volunteers at the Prussian embassy in Florence and a Prussian diplomat visited Giuseppe Garibaldi in Caprera. Bismarck&#x27;s demand that France surrender sovereignty over Alsace caused a dramatic shift in that sentiment in Italy, which was best exemplified by the reaction of Garibaldi soon after the revolution in Paris, who told the &quot;Movimento&quot; of Genoa on 7 September 1870 that &quot;Yesterday I said to you: war to the death to Bonaparte. Today I say to you: rescue the French Republic by every means.&quot; Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, with which he operated around Dijon until the end of the war.

The energetic actions of a part of the government (delegation) in Tours under Gambetta&#x27;s leadership led to significant success in the formation of a new army. In less than four months, with persistent battles at the front, eleven new corps were formed (Nos. XVI–XXVI). The average success of the formation was equal to six thousand infantrymen and two batteries per day. This success was achieved despite the fact that the military industry and warehouses were concentrated mainly in Paris; all supplies in the province—chiefs, weapons, camps, uniforms, ammunition, equipment, baggage—had to be improvised anew. Many branches of the military industry were re-established in the province. Freedom of communication with foreign markets brought significant benefits; it was possible to make large purchases on foreign markets, mainly English, Belgian, and American. The artillery created by Gambetta in four months—238 batteries—was one and a half times larger than the artillery of imperial France. In the end, eight corps participated in the battles, and three were ready only by the end of January, when a truce was already concluded.

While the Germans had a 2:1 numerical advantage before Napoleon III&#x27;s surrender, this French recruitment gave them a 2:1 or 3:1 advantage. The French more than tripled their forces during the war, while the Germans did not increase theirs as much; the number of 888,000 mobilized by the North German Union in August increased by only 2% after months, and by the end of the war, six months later, only by 15%, which did not even balance the losses incurred. Prussia was completely unaware of the feverish activity of permanent mobilization. This disparity in forces created a crisis for the Germans at the front in November 1870, which only the release of the large forces besieging the fortress of Metz allowed them to overcome.

===Siege of Paris===


Prussian forces commenced the siege of Paris on 19 September 1870. Faced with the blockade, the new French government called for the establishment of several large armies in the French provinces. These new bodies of troops were to march towards Paris and attack the Germans there from various directions at the same time. Armed French civilians were to create a guerilla force—the so-called &quot;Francs-tireurs&quot;—for the purpose of attacking German supply lines.

Bismarck was an active supporter of the bombardment of the city. He sought to end the war as soon as possible, very much fearing a change in the international situation unfavorable to Prussia, as he himself called it &quot;the intervention of neutrals&quot;. Therefore, Bismarck constantly and actively insisted on the early start of the bombardment, despite all the objections of the military command. Von Blumenthal, who commanded the siege, was opposed to the bombardment on moral grounds. In this he was backed by other senior military figures such as the Crown Prince and Moltke. Nevertheless, in January, the Germans fired some 12,000 shells (300–400 daily) into the city.

The siege of the city caused great hardships for the population, especially for the poor from cold and hunger.

===Loire campaign===
Dispatched from Paris as the republican government emissary, Léon Gambetta flew over the German lines in a balloon inflated with coal gas from the city&#x27;s gasworks and organized the recruitment of the Armée de la Loire. Rumors about an alleged German &quot;extermination&quot; plan infuriated the French and strengthened their support of the new regime. Within a few weeks, five new armies totalling more than 500,000 troops were recruited.

The Germans dispatched some of their troops to the French provinces to detect, attack and disperse the new French armies before they could become a menace. The Germans were not prepared for an occupation of the whole of France.

On 10 October, hostilities began between German and French republican forces near Orléans. At first, the Germans were victorious but the French drew reinforcements and defeated a Bavarian force at the Battle of Coulmiers on 9 November. After the surrender of Metz, more than 100,000 well-trained and experienced German troops joined the German &#x27;Southern Army&#x27;. The French were forced to abandon Orléans on 4 December, and were finally defeated at the Battle of Le Mans . A second French army which operated north of Paris was turned back at the Battle of Amiens (27 November), the Battle of Bapaume (3 January 1871) and the Battle of St. Quentin (13 January).

===Northern campaign===
Following the Army of the Loire&#x27;s defeats, Gambetta turned to General Faidherbe&#x27;s Army of the North. The army had achieved several small victories at towns such as Ham, La Hallue, and Amiens and was protected by the belt of fortresses in northern France, allowing Faidherbe&#x27;s men to launch quick attacks against isolated Prussian units, then retreat behind the fortresses. Despite access to the armaments factories of Lille, the Army of the North suffered from severe supply difficulties, which depressed morale. In January 1871, Gambetta forced Faidherbe to march his army beyond the fortresses and engage the Prussians in open battle. The army was severely weakened by low morale, supply problems, the terrible winter weather and low troop quality, whilst general Faidherbe was unable to command due to his poor health, the result of decades of campaigning in West Africa. At the Battle of St. Quentin, the Army of the North suffered a crushing defeat and was scattered, releasing thousands of Prussian soldiers to be relocated to the East.

===Eastern campaign===

Following the destruction of the French Army of the Loire, remnants of the Loire army gathered in eastern France to form the Army of the East, commanded by general Charles-Denis Bourbaki. In a final attempt to cut the German supply lines in northeast France, Bourbaki&#x27;s army marched north to attack the Prussian siege of Belfort and relieve the defenders.

The French troops had a significant advantage (110 thousand soldiers against 40 thousand). The French offensive took the Germans by surprise and by mid-January 1871, the French had reached the Lisaine River, just a few kilometers from the besieged fortress of Belfort.

In the battle of the Lisaine, Bourbaki&#x27;s men failed to break through German lines commanded by General August von Werder. Bringing in the German &#x27;Southern Army&#x27;, General von Manteuffel then drove Bourbaki&#x27;s army into the mountains near the Swiss border. Bourbaki attempted to commit suicide, but failed to inflict a fatal wound. Facing annihilation, the last intact French army of 87,000 men (now commanded by General Justin Clinchant) crossed the border and was disarmed and interned by the neutral Swiss near Pontarlier (1 February).

The besieged fortress of Belfort continued to resist until the signing of the armistice, repelling a German attempt to capture the fortress on 27 January, which was some consolation for the French in this stubborn and unhappy campaign.

===Armistice===


On 26 January 1871, the Government of National Defence based in Paris negotiated an armistice with the Prussians. With Paris starving, and Gambetta&#x27;s provincial armies reeling from one disaster after another, French foreign minister Favre went to Versailles on 24 January to discuss peace terms with Bismarck. Bismarck agreed to end the siege and allow food convoys to immediately enter Paris (including trains carrying millions of German army rations), on condition that the Government of National Defence surrender several key fortresses outside Paris to the Prussians. Without the forts, the French Army would no longer be able to defend Paris.

Although public opinion in Paris was strongly against any form of surrender or concession to the Prussians, the Government realised that it could not hold the city for much longer, and that Gambetta&#x27;s provincial armies would probably never break through to relieve Paris. President Trochu resigned on 25 January and was replaced by Favre, who signed the surrender two days later at Versailles, with the armistice coming into effect at midnight.

On 28 January, a truce was concluded for 21 days, after the exhaustion of food and fuel supplies, the Paris garrison capitulated, the National Guard retained its weapons, while German troops occupied part of the forts of Paris to prevent the possibility of resuming hostilities. But military operations continued in the eastern part of the country, in the area of operation of the Bourbaki army. The French side, having no reliable information about the outcome of the struggle, insisted on excluding this area from the truce in the hope of a successful outcome of the struggle. The Germans did not dissuade the French.

Several sources claim that in his carriage on the way back to Paris, Favre broke into tears, and collapsed into his daughter&#x27;s arms as the guns around Paris fell silent at midnight. At Bordeaux, Gambetta received word from Paris on 29 January that the Government had surrendered. Furious, he refused to surrender. Jules Simon, a member of the Government arrived from Paris by train on 1 February to negotiate with Gambetta. Another group of three ministers arrived in Bordeaux on 5 February and the following day Gambetta stepped down and surrendered control of the provincial armies to the Government of National Defence, which promptly ordered a cease-fire across France.

==War at sea==

===Blockade===
When the war began, the French government ordered a blockade of the North German coasts, which the small North German Federal Navy with only five ironclads and various minor vessels could do little to oppose. For most of the war, the three largest German ironclads were out of service with engine troubles; only the turret ship was available to conduct operations. By the time engine repairs had been completed, the French fleet had already departed. The blockade proved only partially successful due to crucial oversights by the planners in Paris. Reservists that were supposed to be at the ready in case of war, were working in the Newfoundland fisheries or in Scotland. Only part of the 470-ship French Navy put to sea on 24 July. Before long, the French navy ran short of coal, needing per day and having a bunker capacity in the fleet of only . A blockade of Wilhelmshaven failed, and conflicting orders about operations in the Baltic Sea or a return to France made the French naval efforts futile. Spotting a blockade-runner became unwelcome because of the ; pursuit of Prussian ships quickly depleted the coal reserves of the French ships. But the main reason for the only partial success of the naval operation was the fear of the French command to risk political complications with Great Britain. This deterred the French command from trying to interrupt German trade under the British flag. Despite the limited measures of the blockade, it still created noticeable difficulties for German trade. &quot;The actual captures of German ships were eighty in number&quot;.

To relieve pressure from the expected German attack into Alsace-Lorraine, Napoleon III and the French high command planned a seaborne invasion of northern Germany as soon as war began. The French expected the invasion to divert German troops and to encourage Denmark to join in the war, with its 50,000-strong army and the Royal Danish Navy. They discovered that Prussia had recently built defences around the big North German ports, including coastal artillery batteries with Krupp heavy artillery, which with a range of , had double the range of French naval guns. The French Navy lacked the heavy guns to engage the coastal defences and the topography of the Prussian coast made a seaborne invasion of northern Germany impossible.

The French Marines intended for the invasion of northern Germany were dispatched to reinforce the French Army of Châlons and fell into captivity at Sedan along with Napoleon III. A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led to naval officers being sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the &quot;Garde Mobile&quot;. As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter. The rest of the navy retired to ports along the English Channel and remained in port for the rest of the war.

===Pacific and Caribbean===
Outside Europe, the French corvette &quot;Dupleix&quot; blockaded the German corvette in Nagasaki and the Battle of Havana took place between the Prussian gunboat and the French aviso &quot;Bouvet&quot; off Havana, Cuba, in November 1870.

== War crimes ==
The Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 resulted in numerous war crimes committed by the Prussian army. One notable war crime committed during the conflict was the execution of prisoners of war. Reports indicate that several hundred French prisoners were summarily executed by Prussian soldiers. This included the execution of a group of over 200 French soldiers at the village of Dornach, which was subsequently referred to as the &quot;Dornach atrocities&quot;.

In the small town of Bazeilles, near Sedan, French marines and partisans put up a resistance against a force of Bavarian soldiers. After the initial French resistance was overcome, the Bavarian troops shelled the village with artillery before sending in infantry to continue the assault. In battle, some surrendering soldiers were shot on the spot, and over 400 buildings were destroyed. The Bavarian troops detained around one hundred civilians, believing they illegally took part in the battle, only to release them unharmed the next day. After the war investigations established that 39 civilians were killed or wounded during the battle.

Prussian soldiers were also accused of committing acts of violence against civilians, including murder, rape, and the destruction of property.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
The quick German victory over the French stunned neutral observers, many of whom had expected a French victory and a long war. The strategic advantages which the Germans had were not appreciated outside Germany until after hostilities had ceased. Other countries quickly discerned the advantages given to the Germans by their military system, and adopted many of their innovations, particularly the general staff, universal conscription, and highly detailed mobilization systems.

The Prussian General Staff developed by Moltke proved to be extremely effective, in contrast to the traditional French school. This was in large part because the Prussian General Staff was created to study previous Prussian operations and learn to avoid mistakes. The structure also greatly strengthened Moltke&#x27;s ability to control large formations spread out over significant distances. The Chief of the General Staff, effectively the commander in chief of the Prussian army, was independent of the minister of war and answered only to the monarch. The French General Staff—along with those of every other European military—was little better than a collection of assistants for the line commanders. This disorganization hampered the French commanders&#x27; ability to exercise control of their forces.

In addition, the Prussian military education system was superior to the French model; Prussian staff officers were trained to exhibit initiative and independent thinking. Indeed, this was Moltke&#x27;s expectation. The French, meanwhile, suffered from an education and promotion system that stifled intellectual development. According to the military historian Dallas Irvine, the system: 

Albrecht von Roon, the Prussian Minister of War from 1859 to 1873, put into effect a series of reforms of the Prussian military system in the 1860s. Among these were two major reforms that substantially increased the military power of Germany. The first was a reorganization of the army that integrated the regular army and the &quot;Landwehr&quot; reserves. The second was the provision for the conscription of every male Prussian of military age in the event of mobilization. Thus, although the population of France was greater than the population of all of the Northern German states that participated in the war, the Germans mobilized more soldiers for battle.

At the start of the Franco-Prussian War, 462,000 German soldiers concentrated on the French frontier while only 270,000 French soldiers could be moved to face them, the French army having lost 100,000 stragglers before a shot was fired, through poor planning and administration. This was partly due to the peacetime organisations of the armies. Each Prussian Corps was based within a &quot;Kreis&quot; (literally &quot;circle&quot;) around the chief city in an area. Reservists rarely lived more than a day&#x27;s travel from their regiment&#x27;s depot. By contrast, French regiments generally served far from their depots, which in turn were not in the areas of France from which their soldiers were drawn. Reservists often faced several days&#x27; journey to report to their depots, and then another long journey to join their regiments. Large numbers of reservists choked railway stations, vainly seeking rations and orders.

The effect of these differences was accentuated by the peacetime preparations. The Prussian General Staff had drawn up minutely detailed mobilization plans using the railway system, which in turn had been partly laid out in response to recommendations of a Railway Section within the General Staff. The French railway system, with competing companies, had developed purely from commercial pressures and many journeys to the front in Alsace and Lorraine involved long diversions and frequent changes between trains. There was no system of military control of the railways and officers simply commandeered trains as they saw fit. Rail sidings and marshalling yards became choked with loaded wagons, with nobody responsible for unloading them or directing them to the destination.

France also suffered from an outdated tactical system. Although referred to as &quot;Napoleonic tactics&quot;, this system was developed by Antoine-Henri Jomini during his time in Russia. Surrounded by a rigid aristocracy with a &quot;Sacred Social Order&quot; mentality, Jomini&#x27;s system was equally rigid and inflexible. His system simplified several formations that were meant for an entire army, using battalions as the building blocks. His system was simple, but only strong enough to attack in one direction. The system was adopted by the Bourbons to prevent a repeat of when Napoleon I had returned to France, and Napoleon III retained the system upon his ascension to power (hence why they became associated with his family name). The Prussians in contrast did not use battalions as their basic tactical unit, and their system was much more flexible. Companies were formed into columns and attacked in parallel, rather than as a homogeneous battalion-sized block. Attacking in parallel allowed each company to choose its own axis of advance and make the most of local cover. It also permitted the Prussians to fire at oblique angles, raking the French lines with rifle fire. Thus, even though the Prussians had inferior rifles, they still inflicted more casualties with rifle fire than the French, with 53,900 French killed by the Dreyse (70% of their war casualties) versus 25,475 Germans killed by the Chassepot (96% of their war casualties).

Although Austria-Hungary and Denmark had both wished to avenge their recent military defeats against Prussia, they chose not to intervene in the war due to a lack of confidence in the French. These countries did not have a documented alliance with France, and they were too late to start a war. After the rapid and stunning victories of Prussia, they preferred to abandon any plans to intervene in the war altogether. Napoleon III also failed to cultivate alliances with the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom, partially due to the diplomatic efforts of the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Bismarck had bought Tsar Alexander II&#x27;s complicity by promising to help restore his naval access to the Black Sea and Mediterranean (cut off by the treaties ending the Crimean War), other powers were less biddable. &quot;Seizing upon the distraction of the Franco-Prussian War, Russia in November 1870 had begun rebuilding its naval bases in the Black Sea, a clear violation of the treaty that had ended the Crimean War fourteen years earlier&quot;. After the peace of Frankfurt in 1871, a rapprochement between France and Russia was born. &quot;Instead of forging ties with Russia in the east and further crippling France in the west, Bismarck&#x27;s miscalculation had opened the door to future relations between Paris and St. Petersburg. The culmination of this new relationship will finally be the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894; an alliance that explicitly refers to the perceived threat of Germany and its military response&quot;.

The United Kingdom saw nothing wrong with the strengthening of Prussia on the European continent, viewing France as its traditional rival in international affairs. Lord Palmerston, the head of the British cabinet in 1865, wrote: &quot;The current Prussia is too weak to be honest and independent in its actions. And, taking into account the interests of the future, it is highly desirable for Germany as a whole became strong, so she was able to keep the ambitious and warlike nation, France, and Russia, which compress it from the West and the East&quot;. English historians criticize the then British policy, pointing out that Palmerston misunderstood Bismarck&#x27;s policy due to his adherence to outdated ideas. Over time, Britain began to understand that the military defeat of France meant a radical change in the European balance of power. In the future, the development of historical events is characterized by a gradual increase in Anglo-German contradictions. &quot;The colonial quarrels, naval rivalry and disagreement over the European balance of power which drove Britain and Germany apart, were in effect the strategical and geopolitical manifestations of the relative shift in the economic power of these two countries between 1860 and 1914&quot;.

After the Peace of Prague in 1866, the nominally independent German states of Saxony, Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt (the southern part that was not included in the North German Union) remained. Despite the fact that there was a strong opposition to Prussia in the ruling circles and in the war of 1866 they participated on the side of Austria against Prussia, they were forced to reckon with a broad popular movement in favor of German unity and were also afraid of angering their strong neighbor in the form of Prussia. After the diplomatic provocation in Bad Ems, these states had no room for maneuver, the war was presented by Bismarck as a war for national independence against an external enemy. All these states joined the Prussian war from the very beginning of hostilities. In January 1871, these states became part of the German Empire.

The French breech-loading rifle, the Chassepot, had a longer range than the German needle gun; compared to . The French also had an early machine-gun type weapon, the mitrailleuse, which could fire its thirty-seven barrels at a range of around . It was developed in such secrecy that little training with the weapon had occurred, leaving French gunners with little experience; the gun was treated like artillery and in this role it was ineffective. Worse still, once the small number of soldiers who had been trained how to use the new weapon became casualties, there were no replacements who knew how to operate the mitrailleuse.

The French were equipped with bronze, rifled muzzle-loading artillery, while the Prussians used new steel breech-loading guns, which had a far longer range and a faster rate of fire. Prussian gunners strove for a high rate of fire, which was discouraged in the French army in the belief that it wasted ammunition. In addition, the Prussian artillery batteries had 30% more guns than their French counterparts (8 guns per Prussian battery compared to 6 French guns). The Prussian guns typically opened fire at a range of , beyond the range of French artillery or the Chassepot rifle. The Prussian batteries could thus destroy French artillery with impunity, before being moved forward to directly support infantry attacks. The Germans fired 30,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition and 362,662 field artillery rounds.

===Effects on military thought===
The events of the Franco-Prussian War had great influence on military thinking over the next forty years. Lessons drawn from the war included the need for a general staff system, the scale and duration of future wars and the tactical use of artillery and cavalry. The bold use of artillery by the Prussians, to silence French guns at long range and then to directly support infantry attacks at close range, proved to be superior to the defensive doctrine employed by French gunners. Likewise, the war showed that breech-loading cannons were superior to muzzle-loaded cannons, just as the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 had demonstrated for rifles. The Prussian tactics and designs were adopted by European armies by 1914, exemplified in the French 75, an artillery piece optimised to provide direct fire support to advancing infantry. Most European armies ignored the evidence of the Russo-Japanese War of which suggested that infantry armed with new smokeless-powder rifles could engage gun crews effectively in the open. This forced gunners to fire at longer range using indirect fire, usually from a position of cover. The heavy use of fortifications and dugouts in the Russo-Japanese war also greatly undermined the usefulness of field artillery which was not designed for indirect fire.

At the Battle of Mars-La-Tour, the Prussian 12th Cavalry Brigade, commanded by General Adalbert von Bredow, conducted a charge against a French artillery battery. The attack was a costly success and came to be known as &quot;von Bredow&#x27;s Death Ride&quot;, but which nevertheless was held to prove that cavalry charges could still prevail on the battlefield. Use of traditional cavalry on the battlefields of 1914 proved to be disastrous, due to accurate, long-range rifle fire, machine-guns and artillery. Bredow&#x27;s attack had succeeded only because of an unusually effective artillery bombardment just before the charge, along with favorable terrain that masked his approach.

A third influence was the effect on notions of entrenchment and its limitations. While the American Civil War had famously involved entrenchment in the final years of the war, the Prussian system had overwhelmed French attempts to use similar tactics. With Prussian tactics seeming to make entrenchment and prolonged offensive campaigns ineffective, the experience of the American Civil War was seen as that of a musket war, not a rifle war. Many European armies were convinced of the viability of the &quot;cult of the offensive&quot; because of this, and focused their attention on aggressive bayonet charges over infantry fire. These would needlessly expose men to artillery fire in 1914, and entrenchment would return with a vengeance.

===Casualties===
The Germans deployed a total of 33,101 officers and 1,113,254 men into France, of whom they lost 1,046 officers and 16,539 enlisted men killed in action. Another 671 officers and 10,050 men died of their wounds, for total battle deaths of 28,306. Disease killed 207 officers and 11,940 men, with typhoid accounting for 6,965. 4,009 were missing and presumed dead; 290 died in accidents and 29 committed suicide. Among the missing and captured were 103 officers and 10,026 men. The wounded amounted to 3,725 officers and 86,007 men.

French battle deaths were 77,000, of which 41,000 were killed in action and 36,000 died of wounds. More than 45,000 died of sickness. Total deaths were 138,871, with 136,540 being suffered by the army and 2,331 by the navy. The wounded totaled 137,626; 131,000 for the army and 6,526 for the navy. French prisoners of war numbered 383,860. In addition, 90,192 French soldiers were interned in Switzerland and 6,300 in Belgium.

During the war the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) established an international tracing agency in Basel for prisoners of that war. The holdings of the &quot;Basel Agency&quot; were later transferred to the ICRC headquarters in Geneva and integrated into the ICRC archives, where they are accessible today.

==Subsequent events==

===Prussian reaction and withdrawal===
The Prussian Army, under the terms of the armistice, held a brief victory parade in Paris on 1 March; the city was silent and draped with black and the Germans quickly withdrew. Bismarck honoured the armistice, by allowing train loads of food into Paris and withdrawing Prussian forces to the east of the city, prior to a full withdrawal once France agreed to pay a five billion franc war indemnity. The indemnity was proportioned, according to population, to be the exact equivalent to the indemnity imposed by Napoleon on Prussia in 1807. At the same time, Prussian forces were concentrated in the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. An exodus occurred from Paris as some 200,000 people, predominantly middle-class, went to the countryside.

===Paris Commune===

During the war, the Paris National Guard, particularly in the working-class neighbourhoods of Paris, had become highly politicised and units elected officers; many refused to wear uniforms or obey commands from the national government. National guard units tried to seize power in Paris on 31 October 1870 and 22 January 1871. On 18 March 1871, when the regular army tried to remove cannons from an artillery park on Montmartre, National Guard units resisted and killed two army generals. The national government and regular army forces retreated to Versailles and a revolutionary government was proclaimed in Paris. A commune was elected, which was dominated by socialists, anarchists and revolutionaries. The red flag replaced the French tricolour and a civil war began between the Commune and the regular army, which attacked and recaptured Paris from in the (&quot;bloody week&quot;).

During the fighting, the Communards killed around 500 people, including Georges Darboy, the Archbishop of Paris, and burned down many government buildings, including the Tuileries Palace and the Hotel de Ville. Communards captured with weapons were routinely shot by the army and Government troops killed between 7,000 and 30,000 Communards, both during the fighting and in massacres of men, women, and children during and after the Commune. More recent histories, based on studies of the number buried in Paris cemeteries and in mass graves after the fall of the Commune, put the number killed at between 6,000 and 10,000. Twenty-six courts were established to try more than who had been arrested, which took until 1875 and imposed sentences, of which inflicted. Forced labour for life was imposed on were transported to &quot;a fortified place&quot; and were transported . About were held in prison hulks until released in 1872 and a great many Communards fled abroad to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Belgium or the United States. The survivors were amnestied by a bill introduced by Gambetta in 1880 and allowed to return.

===1871 Kabyle revolt===
In 1830, the French army invaded and conquered the Beylik of Algiers. Afterwards, France colonized the country, setting up its own administration over Algeria. The withdrawal of a large proportion of the army stationed in French Algeria to serve in the Franco-Prussian War had weakened France&#x27;s control of the territory, while reports of defeats undermined French prestige amongst the indigenous population. The most serious native insurrection since the time of Emir Abdelkader was the 1871 Mokrani Revolt in the Kabylia, which spread through much of Algeria. By April 1871, 250 tribes had risen, or nearly a third of Algeria&#x27;s population.

===German unification and power===

The creation of a unified German Empire (which excluded Austria) greatly disturbed the balance of power that had been created with the Congress of Vienna after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Germany had established itself as a major power in continental Europe, boasting one of the most powerful and professional armies in the world. Although the UK remained the dominant world power overall, British involvement in European affairs during the late 19th century was limited, owing to its focus on colonial empire-building, allowing Germany to exercise great influence over the European mainland. Anglo-German straining of tensions was somewhat mitigated by several prominent relationships between the two powers, such as the Crown Prince&#x27;s marriage with the daughter of Queen Victoria.

&quot;Einheit&quot;—unity—was achieved at the expense of &quot;Freiheit&quot;—freedom. According to Karl Marx, the German Empire became &quot;a military despotism cloaked in parliamentary forms with a feudal ingredient, influenced by the bourgeoisie, festooned with bureaucrats and guarded by police.&quot; Likewise, many historians would see Germany&#x27;s &quot;escape into war&quot; in 1914 as a flight from all of the internal-political contradictions forged by Bismarck at Versailles in the fall of 1870.

===French reaction and Revanchism===

The defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the birth of Revanchism (literally, &quot;revenge-ism&quot;) in France, characterised by a deep sense of bitterness, hatred and demand for revenge against Germany. This was particularly manifested in loose talk of another war with Germany in order to reclaim Alsace and Lorraine. It also led to the development of nationalist ideologies emphasising &quot;the ideal of the guarded, self-referential nation schooled in the imperative of war&quot;, an ideology epitomised by figures such as General Georges Ernest Boulanger in the 1880s. Paintings that emphasized the humiliation of the defeat became in high demand, such as those by Alphonse de Neuville.

Revanchism was not a major cause of war in 1914 because it faded after 1880. J.F.V. Keiger says, &quot;By the 1880s Franco-German relations were relatively good.&quot; The French public had very little interest in foreign affairs and elite French opinion was strongly opposed to war with its more powerful neighbor. The elites were now calm and considered it a minor issue. The Alsace-Lorraine issue remained a minor theme after 1880, and Republicans and Socialists systematically downplayed the issue. Return did not become a French war aim until after World War I began.

<doc id="44041" wikidata="Q739398" url="?curid=44041" title="Solvation">
<text>Solvations describes the interaction of a solvent with dissolved molecules. Both ionized and uncharged molecules interact strongly with a solvent, and the strength and nature of this interaction influence many properties of the solute, including solubility, reactivity, and color, as well as influencing the properties of the solvent such as its viscosity and density. If the attractive forces between the solvent and solute particles are greater than the attractive forces holding the solute particles together, the solvent particles pull the solute particles apart and surround them. The surrounded solute particles then move away from the solid solute and out into the solution. Ions are surrounded by a concentric shell of solvent. Solvation is the process of reorganizing solvent and solute molecules into solvation complexes and involves bond formation, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces. Solvation of a solute by water is called hydration.

Solubility of solid compounds depends on a competition between lattice energy and solvation, including entropy effects related to changes in the solvent structure.

== Distinction from solubility ==
By an IUPAC definition, solvation is an interaction of a solute with the solvent, which leads to stabilization of the solute species in the solution. In the solvated state, an ion or molecule in a solution is surrounded or complexed by solvent molecules. Solvated species can often be described by coordination number, and the complex stability constants. The concept of the solvation interaction can also be applied to an insoluble material, for example, solvation of functional groups on a surface of ion-exchange resin.

Solvation is, in concept, distinct from solubility. Solvation or dissolution is a kinetic process and is quantified by its rate. Solubility quantifies the dynamic equilibrium state achieved when the rate of dissolution equals the rate of precipitation. The consideration of the units makes the distinction clearer. The typical unit for dissolution rate is mol/s. The units for solubility express a concentration: mass per volume (mg/mL), molarity (mol/L), etc.

== Solvents and intermolecular interactions ==
Solvation involves different types of intermolecular interactions: 

* Hydrogen bonding
* Ion–dipole interactions
* The van der Waals forces, which consist of dipole–dipole, dipole–induced dipole, and induced dipole–induced dipole interactions. 

Which of these forces are at play depends on the molecular structure and properties of the solvent and solute. The similarity or complementary character of these properties between solvent and solute determines how well a solute can be solvated by a particular solvent.

Solvent polarity is the most important factor in determining how well it solvates a particular solute. Polar solvents have molecular dipoles, meaning that part of the solvent molecule has more electron density than another part of the molecule. The part with more electron density will experience a partial negative charge while the part with less electron density will experience a partial positive charge. Polar solvent molecules can solvate polar solutes and ions because they can orient the appropriate partially charged portion of the molecule towards the solute through electrostatic attraction. This stabilizes the system and creates a solvation shell (or hydration shell in the case of water) around each particle of solute. The solvent molecules in the immediate vicinity of a solute particle often have a much different ordering than the rest of the solvent, and this area of differently ordered solvent molecules is called the cybotactic region. Water is the most common and well-studied polar solvent, but others exist, such as ethanol, methanol, acetone, acetonitrile, and dimethyl sulfoxide. Polar solvents are often found to have a high dielectric constant, although other solvent scales are also used to classify solvent polarity. Polar solvents can be used to dissolve inorganic or ionic compounds such as salts. The conductivity of a solution depends on the solvation of its ions. Nonpolar solvents cannot solvate ions, and ions will be found as ion pairs.

Hydrogen bonding among solvent and solute molecules depends on the ability of each to accept H-bonds, donate H-bonds, or both. Solvents that can donate H-bonds are referred to as protic, while solvents that do not contain a polarized bond to a hydrogen atom and cannot donate a hydrogen bond are called aprotic. H-bond donor ability is classified on a scale (α). Protic solvents can solvate solutes that can accept hydrogen bonds. Similarly, solvents that can accept a hydrogen bond can solvate H-bond-donating solutes. The hydrogen bond acceptor ability of a solvent is classified on a scale (β). Solvents such as water can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds, making them excellent at solvating solutes that can donate or accept (or both) H-bonds.

Some chemical compounds experience solvatochromism, which is a change in color due to solvent polarity. This phenomenon illustrates how different solvents interact differently with the same solute. Other solvent effects include conformational or isomeric preferences and changes in the acidity of a solute.

== Solvation energy and thermodynamic considerations ==
The solvation process will be thermodynamically favored only if the overall Gibbs energy of the solution is decreased, compared to the Gibbs energy of the separated solvent and solid (or gas or liquid). This means that the change in enthalpy minus the change in entropy (multiplied by the absolute temperature) is a negative value, or that the Gibbs energy of the system decreases. A negative Gibbs energy indicates a spontaneous process but does not provide information about the rate of dissolution.

Solvation involves multiple steps with different energy consequences. First, a cavity must form in the solvent to make space for a solute. This is both entropically and enthalpically unfavorable, as solvent ordering increases and solvent-solvent interactions decrease. Stronger interactions among solvent molecules leads to a greater enthalpic penalty for cavity formation. Next, a particle of solute must separate from the bulk. This is enthalpically unfavorable since solute-solute interactions decrease, but when the solute particle enters the cavity, the resulting solvent-solute interactions are enthalpically favorable. Finally, as solute mixes into solvent, there is an entropy gain.

The enthalpy of solution is the solution enthalpy minus the enthalpy of the separate systems, whereas the entropy of solution is the corresponding difference in entropy. The solvation energy (change in Gibbs free energy) is the change in enthalpy minus the product of temperature (in Kelvin) times the change in entropy. Gases have a negative entropy of solution, due to the decrease in gaseous volume as gas dissolves. Since their enthalpy of solution does not decrease too much with temperature, and their entropy of solution is negative and does not vary appreciably with temperature, most gases are less soluble at higher temperatures.

Enthalpy of solvation can help explain why solvation occurs with some ionic lattices but not with others. The difference in energy between that which is necessary to release an ion from its lattice and the energy given off when it combines with a solvent molecule is called the enthalpy change of solution. A negative value for the enthalpy change of solution corresponds to an ion that is likely to dissolve, whereas a high positive value means that solvation will not occur. It is possible that an ion will dissolve even if it has a positive enthalpy value. The extra energy required comes from the increase in entropy that results when the ion dissolves. The introduction of entropy makes it harder to determine by calculation alone whether a substance will dissolve or not. A quantitative measure for solvation power of solvents is given by donor numbers.

Although early thinking was that a higher ratio of a cation&#x27;s ion charge to ionic radius, or the charge density, resulted in more solvation, this does not stand up to scrutiny for ions like iron(III) or lanthanides and actinides, which are readily hydrolyzed to form insoluble (hydrous) oxides. As these are solids, it is apparent that they are not solvated.

Strong solvent–solute interactions make the process of solvation more favorable. One way to compare how favorable the dissolution of a solute is in different solvents is to consider the free energy of transfer. The free energy of transfer quantifies the free energy difference between dilute solutions of a solute in two different solvents. This value essentially allows for comparison of solvation energies without including solute-solute interactions.

In general, thermodynamic analysis of solutions is done by modeling them as reactions. For example, if you add sodium chloride to water, the salt will dissociate into the ions sodium(+aq) and chloride(-aq). The equilibrium constant for this dissociation can be predicted by the change in Gibbs energy of this reaction.

The Born equation is used to estimate Gibbs free energy of solvation of a gaseous ion.

Recent simulation studies have shown that the variation in solvation energy between the ions and the surrounding water molecules underlies the mechanism of the Hofmeister series.

==Macromolecules and assemblies==

Solvation (specifically, hydration) is important for many biological structures and processes. For instance, solvation of ions and/or of charged macromolecules, like DNA and proteins, in aqueous solutions influences the formation of heterogeneous assemblies, which may be responsible for biological function. As another example, protein folding occurs spontaneously, in part because of a favorable change in the interactions between the protein and the surrounding water molecules. Folded proteins are stabilized by 5-10 kcal/mol relative to the unfolded state due to a combination of solvation and the stronger intramolecular interactions in the folded protein structure, including hydrogen bonding. Minimizing the number of hydrophobic side chains exposed to water by burying them in the center of a folded protein is a driving force related to solvation.

Solvation also affects host–guest complexation. Many host molecules have a hydrophobic pore that readily encapsulates a hydrophobic guest. These interactions can be used in applications such as drug delivery, such that a hydrophobic drug molecule can be delivered in a biological system without needing to covalently modify the drug in order to solubilize it. Binding constants for host–guest complexes depend on the polarity of the solvent.

Hydration affects electronic and vibrational properties of biomolecules.

== Importance of solvation in computer simulations ==
Due to the importance of the effects of solvation on the structure of macromolecules, early computer simulations which attempted to model their behaviors without including the effects of solvent (&quot;in vacuo&quot;) could yield poor results when compared with experimental data obtained in solution. Small molecules may also adopt more compact conformations when simulated &quot;in vacuo&quot;; this is due to favorable van der Waals interactions and intramolecular electrostatic interactions which would be dampened in the presence of a solvent.

As computer power increased, it became possible to try and incorporate the effects of solvation within a simulation and the simplest way to do this is to surround the molecule being simulated with a &quot;skin&quot; of solvent molecules, akin to simulating the molecule within a drop of solvent if the skin is sufficiently deep.

<doc id="44044" wikidata="Q43518" url="?curid=44044" title="Oceanography">
<text>Oceanography (), also known as oceanology, sea science, ocean science, and marine science, is the scientific study of the ocean, including its physics, chemistry, biology, and geology. 

It is an Earth science, which covers a wide range of topics, including ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries; ecosystem dynamics; and plate tectonics and seabed geology. 

Oceanographers draw upon a wide range of disciplines to deepen their understanding of the world’s oceans, incorporating insights from astronomy, biology, chemistry, geography, geology, hydrology, meteorology and physics.

==History==
===Early history===
Humans first acquired knowledge of the waves and currents of the seas and oceans in pre-historic times. Observations on tides were recorded by Aristotle and Strabo in 384–322 BC. Early exploration of the oceans was primarily for cartography and mainly limited to its surfaces and of the animals that fishermen brought up in nets, though depth soundings by lead line were taken.

The Portuguese campaign of Atlantic navigation is the earliest example of a systematic scientific large project, sustained over many decades, studying the currents and winds of the Atlantic.

The work of Pedro Nunes (1502–1578) is remembered in the navigation context for the determination of the loxodromic curve: the shortest course between two points on the surface of a sphere represented onto a two-dimensional map. When he published his &quot;Treatise of the Sphere&quot; (1537), mostly a commentated translation of earlier work by others, he included a treatise on geometrical and astronomic methods of navigation. There he states clearly that Portuguese navigations were not an adventurous endeavour:

&quot;nam se fezeram indo a acertar: mas partiam os nossos mareantes muy ensinados e prouidos de estromentos e regras de astrologia e geometria que sam as cousas que os cosmographos ham dadar apercebidas (...) e leuaua cartas muy particularmente rumadas e na ja as de que os antigos vsauam&quot; (were not done by chance: but our seafarers departed well taught and provided with instruments and rules of astrology (astronomy) and geometry which were matters the cosmographers would provide (...) and they took charts with exact routes and no longer those used by the ancient).

His credibility rests on being personally involved in the instruction of pilots and senior seafarers from 1527 onwards by Royal appointment, along with his recognized competence as mathematician and astronomer.
The main problem in navigating back from the south of the Canary Islands (or south of Boujdour) by sail alone, is due to the change in the regime of winds and currents: the North Atlantic gyre and the Equatorial counter current will push south along the northwest bulge of Africa, while the uncertain winds where the Northeast trades meet the Southeast trades (the doldrums) leave a sailing ship to the mercy of the currents. Together, prevalent current and wind make northwards progress very difficult or impossible. It was to overcome this problem and clear the passage to India around Africa as a viable maritime trade route, that a systematic plan of exploration was devised by the Portuguese. The return route from regions south of the Canaries became the &#x27;volta do largo&#x27; or &#x27;volta do mar&#x27;. The &#x27;rediscovery&#x27; of the Azores islands in 1427 is merely a reflection of the heightened strategic importance of the islands, now sitting on the return route from the western coast of Africa (sequentially called &#x27;volta de Guiné&#x27; and &#x27;volta da Mina&#x27;); and the references to the Sargasso Sea (also called at the time &#x27;Mar da Baga&#x27;), to the west of the Azores, in 1436, reveals the western extent of the return route. This is necessary, under sail, to make use of the southeasterly and northeasterly winds away from the western coast of Africa, up to the northern latitudes where the westerly winds will bring the seafarers towards the western coasts of Europe.

The secrecy involving the Portuguese navigations, with the death penalty for the leaking of maps and routes, concentrated all sensitive records in the Royal Archives, completely destroyed by the Lisbon earthquake of 1775. However, the systematic nature of the Portuguese campaign, mapping the currents and winds of the Atlantic, is demonstrated by the understanding of the seasonal variations, with expeditions setting sail at different times of the year taking different routes to take account of seasonal predominate winds. This happens from as early as late 15th century and early 16th: Bartolomeu Dias followed the African coast on his way south in August 1487, while Vasco da Gama would take an open sea route from the latitude of Sierra Leone, spending three months in the open sea of the South Atlantic to profit from the southwards deflection of the southwesterly on the Brazilian side (and the Brazilian current going southward - Gama departed in July 1497); and Pedro Álvares Cabral (departing March 1500) took an even larger arch to the west, from the latitude of Cape Verde, thus avoiding the summer monsoon (which would have blocked the route taken by Gama at the time he set sail). Furthermore, there were systematic expeditions pushing into the western Northern Atlantic (Teive, 1454; Vogado, 1462; Teles, 1474; Ulmo, 1486).

The documents relating to the supplying of ships, and the ordering of sun declination tables for the southern Atlantic for as early as 1493–1496, all suggest a well-planned and systematic activity happening during the decade long period between Bartolomeu Dias finding the southern tip of Africa, and Gama&#x27;s departure; additionally, there are indications of further travels by Bartolomeu Dias in the area. The most significant consequence of this systematic knowledge was the negotiation of the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, moving the line of demarcation 270 leagues to the west (from 100 to 370 leagues west of the Azores), bringing what is now Brazil into the Portuguese area of domination. The knowledge gathered from open sea exploration allowed for the well-documented extended periods of sail without sight of land, not by accident but as pre-determined planned route; for example, 30 days for Bartolomeu Dias culminating on Mossel Bay, the three months Gama spent in the South Atlantic to use the Brazil current (southward), or the 29 days Cabral took from Cape Verde up to landing in Monte Pascoal, Brazil.

The Danish expedition to Arabia 1761–67 can be said to be the world&#x27;s first oceanographic expedition, as the ship Grønland had on board a group of scientists, including naturalist Peter Forsskål, who was assigned an explicit task by the king, Frederik V, to study and describe the marine life in the open sea, including finding the cause of mareel, or milky seas. For this purpose, the expedition was equipped with nets and scrapers, specifically designed to collect samples from the open waters and the bottom at great depth.

Although Juan Ponce de León in 1513 first identified the Gulf Stream, and the current was well known to mariners, Benjamin Franklin made the first scientific study of it and gave it its name. Franklin measured water temperatures during several Atlantic crossings and correctly explained the Gulf Stream&#x27;s cause. Franklin and Timothy Folger printed the first map of the Gulf Stream in 1769–1770.
Information on the currents of the Pacific Ocean was gathered by explorers of the late 18th century, including James Cook and Louis Antoine de Bougainville. James Rennell wrote the first scientific textbooks on oceanography, detailing the current flows of the Atlantic and Indian oceans. During a voyage around the Cape of Good Hope in 1777, he mapped &quot;the banks and currents at the Lagullas&quot;. He was also the first to understand the nature of the intermittent current near the Isles of Scilly, (now known as Rennell&#x27;s Current). The tides and currents of the ocean are distinct. Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels created by the combination of the gravitational forces of the Moon along with the Sun (the Sun just in a much lesser extent) and are also caused by the Earth and Moon orbiting each other. An ocean current is a continuous, directed movement of seawater generated by a number of forces acting upon the water, including wind, the Coriolis effect, breaking waves, cabbeling, and temperature and salinity differences.

Sir James Clark Ross took the first modern sounding in deep sea in 1840, and Charles Darwin published a paper on reefs and the formation of atolls as a result of the second voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; in 1831–1836. Robert FitzRoy published a four-volume report of &quot;Beagle&quot;″s three voyages. In 1841–1842 Edward Forbes undertook dredging in the Aegean Sea that founded marine ecology.

The first superintendent of the United States Naval Observatory (1842–1861), Matthew Fontaine Maury devoted his time to the study of marine meteorology, navigation, and charting prevailing winds and currents. His 1855 textbook &quot;Physical Geography of the Sea&quot; was one of the first comprehensive oceanography studies. Many nations sent oceanographic observations to Maury at the Naval Observatory, where he and his colleagues evaluated the information and distributed the results worldwide.

=== Modern oceanography ===
Knowledge of the oceans remained confined to the topmost few fathoms of the water and a small amount of the bottom, mainly in shallow areas. Almost nothing was known of the ocean depths. The British Royal Navy&#x27;s efforts to chart all of the world&#x27;s coastlines in the mid-19th century reinforced the vague idea that most of the ocean was very deep, although little more was known. As exploration ignited both popular and scientific interest in the polar regions and Africa, so too did the mysteries of the unexplored oceans.
The seminal event in the founding of the modern science of oceanography was the 1872–1876 &quot; Challenger&quot; expedition. As the first true oceanographic cruise, this expedition laid the groundwork for an entire academic and research discipline. In response to a recommendation from the Royal Society, the British Government announced in 1871 an expedition to explore world&#x27;s oceans and conduct appropriate scientific investigation. Charles Wyville Thomson and Sir John Murray launched the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition. , leased from the Royal Navy, was modified for scientific work and equipped with separate laboratories for natural history and chemistry. Under the scientific supervision of Thomson, &quot;Challenger&quot; travelled nearly surveying and exploring. On her journey circumnavigating the globe, 492 deep sea soundings, 133 bottom dredges, 151 open water trawls and 263 serial water temperature observations were taken. Around 4,700 new species of marine life were discovered. The result was the &quot;Report Of The Scientific Results of the Exploring Voyage of H.M.S. Challenger during the years 1873–76&quot;. Murray, who supervised the publication, described the report as &quot;the greatest advance in the knowledge of our planet since the celebrated discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries&quot;. He went on to found the academic discipline of oceanography at the University of Edinburgh, which remained the centre for oceanographic research well into the 20th century. Murray was the first to study marine trenches and in particular the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and map the sedimentary deposits in the oceans. He tried to map out the world&#x27;s ocean currents based on salinity and temperature observations, and was the first to correctly understand the nature of coral reef development.

In the late 19th century, other Western nations also sent out scientific expeditions (as did private individuals and institutions). The first purpose-built oceanographic ship, &quot;Albatros&quot;, was built in 1882. In 1893, Fridtjof Nansen allowed his ship, &quot;Fram&quot;, to be frozen in the Arctic ice. This enabled him to obtain oceanographic, meteorological and astronomical data at a stationary spot over an extended period.


In 1881 the geographer John Francon Williams published a seminal book, &quot;Geography of the Oceans&quot;. Between 1907 and 1911 Otto Krümmel published the &quot;Handbuch der Ozeanographie&quot;, which became influential in awakening public interest in oceanography. The four-month 1910 North Atlantic expedition headed by John Murray and Johan Hjort was the most ambitious research oceanographic and marine zoological project ever mounted until then, and led to the classic 1912 book &quot;The Depths of the Ocean&quot;.

The first acoustic measurement of sea depth was made in 1914. Between 1925 and 1927 the &quot;Meteor&quot; expedition gathered 70,000 ocean depth measurements using an echo sounder, surveying the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

In 1934, Easter Ellen Cupp, the first woman to have earned a PhD (at Scripps) in the United States, completed a major work on diatoms that remained the standard taxonomy in the field until well after her death in 1999. In 1940, Cupp was let go from her position at Scripps. Sverdrup specifically commended Cupp as a conscientious and industrious worker and commented that his decision was no reflection on her ability as a scientist. Sverdrup used the instructor billet vacated by Cupp to employ Marston Sargent, a biologist studying marine algae, which was not a new research program at Scripps. Financial pressures did not prevent Sverdrup from retaining the services of two other young post-doctoral students, Walter Munk and Roger Revelle. Cupp&#x27;s partner, Dorothy Rosenbury, found her a position teaching high school, where she remained for the rest of her career. (Russell, 2000)

Sverdrup, Johnson and Fleming published &quot;The Oceans&quot; in 1942, which was a major landmark. &quot;The Sea&quot; (in three volumes, covering physical oceanography, seawater and geology) edited by M.N. Hill was published in 1962, while Rhodes Fairbridge&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Oceanography&quot; was published in 1966.

The Great Global Rift, running along the Mid Atlantic Ridge, was discovered by Maurice Ewing and Bruce Heezen in 1953 and mapped by Heezen and Marie Tharp using bathymetric data; in 1954 a mountain range under the Arctic Ocean was found by the Arctic Institute of the USSR. The theory of seafloor spreading was developed in 1960 by Harry Hammond Hess. The Ocean Drilling Program started in 1966. Deep-sea vents were discovered in 1977 by Jack Corliss and Robert Ballard in the submersible .

In the 1950s, Auguste Piccard invented the bathyscaphe and used the bathyscaphe to investigate the ocean&#x27;s depths. The United States nuclear submarine made the first journey under the ice to the North Pole in 1958. In 1962 the FLIP (Floating Instrument Platform), a spar buoy, was first deployed.

In 1968, Tanya Atwater led the first all-woman oceanographic expedition. Until that time, gender policies restricted women oceanographers from participating in voyages to a significant extent.

From the 1970s, there has been much emphasis on the application of large scale computers to oceanography to allow numerical predictions of ocean conditions and as a part of overall environmental change prediction. Early techniques included analog computers (such as the Ishiguro Storm Surge Computer) generally now replaced by numerical methods (e.g. SLOSH.) An oceanographic buoy array was established in the Pacific to allow prediction of El Niño events.

1990 saw the start of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) which continued until 2002. Geosat seafloor mapping data became available in 1995.

Study of the oceans is critical to understanding shifts in Earth&#x27;s energy balance along with related global and regional changes in climate, the biosphere and biogeochemistry. The atmosphere and ocean are linked because of evaporation and precipitation as well as thermal flux (and solar insolation). Recent studies have advanced knowledge on ocean acidification, ocean heat content, ocean currents, sea level rise, the oceanic carbon cycle, the water cycle, Arctic sea ice decline, coral bleaching, marine heatwaves, extreme weather, coastal erosion and many other phenomena in regards to ongoing climate change and climate feedbacks.

In general, understanding the world ocean through further scientific study enables better stewardship and sustainable utilization of Earth&#x27;s resources. The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission reports that 1.7% of the total national research expenditure of its members is focused on ocean science.

==Branches==
The study of oceanography is divided into these five branches:

===Biological oceanography===

Biological oceanography investigates the ecology and biology of marine organisms in the context of the physical, chemical and geological characteristics of their ocean environment.

===Chemical oceanography===

Chemical oceanography is the study of the chemistry of the ocean. Whereas chemical oceanography is primarily occupied with the study and understanding of seawater properties and its changes, ocean chemistry focuses primarily on the geochemical cycles. The following is a central topic investigated by chemical oceanography.

====Ocean acidification====

Ocean acidification describes the decrease in ocean pH that is caused by anthropogenic carbon dioxide () emissions into the atmosphere. Seawater is slightly alkaline and had a preindustrial pH of about 8.2. More recently, anthropogenic activities have steadily increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere; about 30–40% of the added CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, forming carbonic acid and lowering the pH (now below 8.1) through ocean acidification. The pH is expected to reach 7.7 by the year 2100.

An important element for the skeletons of marine animals is calcium, but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below the carbonate compensation depth. Calcium carbonate becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to affect marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins and corals, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms will include pteropods, coccolithophorids and foraminifera, all important in the food chain. In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as they become less able to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.

The current rate of ocean chemistry change seems to be unprecedented in Earth&#x27;s geological history, making it unclear how well marine ecosystems will adapt to the shifting conditions of the near future. Of particular concern is the manner in which the combination of acidification with the expected additional stressors of higher ocean temperatures and lower oxygen levels will impact the seas.

===Geological oceanography===

Geological oceanography is the study of the geology of the ocean floor including plate tectonics and paleoceanography.

===Physical oceanography===

Physical oceanography studies the ocean&#x27;s physical attributes including temperature-salinity structure, mixing, surface waves, internal waves, surface tides, internal tides, and currents. The following are central topics investigated by physical oceanography.

====Seismic Oceanography====
====Ocean currents====

Since the early ocean expeditions in oceanography, a major interest was the study of ocean currents and temperature measurements. The tides, the Coriolis effect, changes in direction and strength of wind, salinity, and temperature are the main factors determining ocean currents. The thermohaline circulation (THC) (&quot;thermo-&quot; referring to temperature and &quot;-haline&quot; referring to salt content) connects the ocean basins and is primarily dependent on the density of sea water. It is becoming more common to refer to this system as the &#x27;meridional overturning circulation&#x27; because it more accurately accounts for other driving factors beyond temperature and salinity. 
*Examples of sustained currents are the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current which are wind-driven western boundary currents.

====Ocean heat content====
Oceanic heat content (OHC) refers to the extra heat stored in the ocean from changes in Earth&#x27;s energy balance. The increase in the ocean heat play an important role in sea level rise, because of thermal expansion. Ocean warming accounts for 90% of the energy accumulation associated with global warming since 1971.

===Paleoceanography===

Paleoceanography is the study of the history of the oceans in the geologic past with regard to circulation, chemistry, biology, geology and patterns of sedimentation and biological productivity. Paleoceanographic studies using environment models and different proxies enable the scientific community to assess the role of the oceanic processes in the global climate by the reconstruction of past climate at various intervals. Paleoceanographic research is also intimately tied to palaeoclimatology.

==Oceanographic institutions==
The earliest international organizations of oceanography were founded at the turn of the 20th century, starting with the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea created in 1902, followed in 1919 by the Mediterranean Science Commission. Marine research institutes were already in existence, starting with the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn in Naples, Italy (1872), the Biological Station of Roscoff, France (1876), the Arago Laboratory in Banyuls-sur-mer, France (1882), the Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, UK (1884), the Norwegian Institute for Marine Research in Bergen, Norway (1900), the Laboratory für internationale Meeresforschung, Kiel, Germany (1902). On the other side of the Atlantic, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography was founded in 1903, followed by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1930, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 1938, the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in 1949, and later the School of Oceanography at University of Washington. In Australia, the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), established in 1972 soon became a key player in marine tropical research.

In 1921 the International Hydrographic Bureau, called since 1970 the International Hydrographic Organization, was established to develop hydrographic and nautical charting standards.

<text>Chiricahua ( ) is a band of Apache Native Americans.

Based in the Southern Plains and Southwestern United States, the Chiricahua (Tsokanende) are related to other Apache groups: Ndendahe (Mogollon, Carrizaleño), Tchihende (Mimbreño), Sehende (Mescalero), Lipan, Salinero, Plains, and Western Apache. Chiricahua historically shared a common area, language, customs, and intertwined family relations with their fellow Apaches. At the time of European contact, they had a territory of in Southwestern New Mexico and Southeastern Arizona in the United States and in Northern Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico.

Today Chiricahua live in Northern Mexico and in the United States where they are enrolled in three federally recognized tribes: the Fort Sill Apache Tribe, located near Apache, Oklahoma, with a small reservation outside Deming, New Mexico; the Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation near Ruidoso, New Mexico; and the San Carlos Apache Tribe in southeastern Arizona.

==Name==
The Chiricahua Apache, also written as &quot;Chiricagui&quot;, &quot;Apaches de Chiricahui&quot;, &quot;Chiricahues&quot;, &quot;Chilicague&quot;, &quot;Chilecagez&quot;, and &quot;Chiricagua&quot;, were given that name by the Spanish. The White Mountain Coyotero Apache, including the &quot;Cibecue&quot; and &quot;Bylas&quot; groups of the Western Apache, referred to the Chiricahua by the name Ha&#x27;i’ą́há, while the San Carlos Apache called them Hák&#x27;ą́yé which means ″Eastern Sunrise″, or ″People in the East″. Sometimes they adapted this appellation and referred to themselves also as Ha’ishu Na gukande (&#x27;Sunrise People&#x27;). The Mescalero Apache called the Western Apache and Chiricahua bands to their west Shá&#x27;i&#x27;áõde (&quot;Western Apache People&quot;, &quot;The People of the Sunset&quot;, &quot;The People of the West&quot;), when referring only to Chiricahuas they used Ch&#x27;úk&#x27;ânéõde (&quot;People of a ridge or mountainside [made of loose rocks]&quot;) or sometimes Tã&#x27;aa&#x27;ji k&#x27;ee&#x27;déõkaa&#x27;õde (&quot;The Ones who are Covered [with breech cloths]&quot;). Navajo refer to the Chiricahua as &quot;Chíshí&quot; (&quot;Southern People&quot;).

The Chiricahua autonym, or name by which they refer to themselves, is simply (depending on dialect) &quot;Nde, Ne, Néndé, Héndé&quot;, &quot;Hen-de&quot; or &quot;õne&quot; (&quot;The People, Men&quot;, &quot;the People of&quot;); they never called themselves ″Apaches&quot;. The Chiricahua referred to outsiders, such as Americans, Mexicans or other Indians, as &quot;Enee&quot;, &quot;ⁿdáa&quot; or &quot;Indah / N&#x27;daa&quot;. This word has two possible meanings, the first being &quot;strange people, non-Apache people&quot; or &quot;enemy&quot;, but another being &quot;eye&quot;. Sometimes it is said that all Apaches referred to the Americans and European settlers (with exception of the Mexicans) as &quot;Bi&#x27;ndah-Li&#x27;ghi&#x27; / Bi&#x27;nda-li&#x27;ghi&#x27;o&#x27;yi&quot; (&quot;White Eyes&quot;), but this seems a name from Mescalero and Lipan Apache bands, as the Chiricahua bands called them &quot;Daadatlijende&quot;, meaning &quot;Blue/green eye people&quot; or &quot;Indaaɫigáí / Indaaɫigánde&quot; meaning &quot;White skinned or pale colored people&quot; or literally &quot;Strange, non-Apache people, which are white-skinned&quot;). &quot;Łigáí&quot; means &quot;it is white&quot; or it can be translate as &quot;it is pale colored&quot;. The í on the end usually translates as &quot;the one that is&quot;, but in the context of human beings, can mean &quot;the group who are&quot;.

== Language ==
The Chiricahua language (n&#x27;dee biyat&#x27;i) is a Southern Athabaskan language from the Na-dene language family. It is very closely related to Mescalero, and more distantly related to Western Apache. It&#x27;s considered a national language of Mexico and is regulated by the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas.

==Culture and organization==
Several loosely affiliated bands of Apache came improperly to be usually known as the Chiricahuas. These included the &quot;Chokonen&quot; (recte: Tsokanende), the &quot;Chihenne&quot; (recte: Tchihende), the &quot;Nednai&quot; (&quot;Nednhi&quot;) and &quot;Bedonkohe&quot; (recte, both of them together: Ndendahe). Today, all are commonly referred to as Chiricahua, but they were not historically a single band nor the same Apache division, being more correctly identified, all together, as &quot;Central Apaches&quot;.

Many other bands and groups of Apachean language-speakers ranged over eastern Arizona and the American Southwest. The bands that are grouped under the Chiricahua term today had much history together: they intermarried and lived alongside each other, and they also occasionally fought with each other. They formed short-term as well as longer alliances that have caused scholars to classify them as one people.

The Apachean groups and the Navajo peoples were part of the Athabaskan migration into the North American continent from Asia, across the Bering Strait from Siberia. As the people moved south and east into North America, groups splintered off and became differentiated by language and culture over time. Some anthropologists believe that the Lipan Apache and the Navajo were pushed south and west into what is now New Mexico and Arizona by pressure from other Great Plains Indians, such as the Comanche and Kiowa. Among the last of such splits were those that resulted in the formation of the different Apachean bands whom the later Europeans encountered: the southwestern Apache groups and the Navajo. Although both speaking forms of Southern Athabaskan, the Navajo and Apache have become culturally distinct.

The &quot;Chihenne (Tchihende)&quot;, &quot;Nednai/Nednhi (Ndendahe)&quot; and &quot;Bedonkohe&quot; intermarried sometimes with Mescalero Bands of New Mexico and Chihuahua and formed alliances with them; therefore their Mescalero kin did know the names of Chiricahua bands and local groups: &quot;Chíhéõde&quot; (&quot;The People of Red Ceremonial Paint&quot;, &quot;The Red Ceremonial Paint People&quot;), &quot;Ndé&#x27;ndaa&#x27;õde / Ndé&#x27;ndaaõde&quot; (&quot;The Apache People (who live among) Enemies&quot;) and &quot;Bidáõ&#x27;kaõde / Bidáõ&#x27;kahéõde&quot; (&quot;The People whom We Met&quot;, &quot;The People whom We Came Upon&quot;), The Mescalero use the term -õde, -éõde, -néõde, or -héõde (&quot;the people of&quot;) instead of the Chiricahua Nde, Ne, Néndé, Héndé, Hen-de or õne (&quot;the people of&quot;).

=== Dances ===
Chiricahuas from Mexico participate every year in the &quot;Fiesta de los Remedios&quot; in Comonfort, Guanajuato representing and performing their traditional dances and other ceremonies.

=== Religion ===
The major Chiricahuan deity is called Ussen, an all-powerful creator figure. Other figures in Chiricahuan mythology include White Painted Woman, a virgin who offered herself in sacrifice to end a drought, and her son, Child of the Waters.

&quot;Hoddentin&quot;, ceremonially prepared cattail pollen, is used in many Chiricahuan rituals. John Gregory Bourke recorded that the Chiricahua offered &quot;hoddentin&quot; to the sun, threw it after snakes, and used it in medicine dances and around dying people.

Other traditional practices include death rituals and puberty ceremonies for young women. Caves, waterways, and birthplaces hold special spiritual significance.

==History==

=== Great Migration ===
The Athabaskan ancestors of the Chiricahua people migrated south from Canada along the Rocky Mountains. Historians disagree on the exact dates of the migration, with estimates ranging from the early 1100s to about 1500. Historian Jack D. Forbes speculates that there may have been two or more mass migrations during this time period.

=== 18th century ===
The Tsokanende (Chiricahua) Apache division was once led, from the beginning of the 18th century, by chiefs such as Pisago Cabezón, Relles, Posito Moraga, Yrigollen, Tapilá, Teboca, Vívora, Miguel Narbona, Esquinaline, and finally Cochise (whose name was derived from the Apache word &quot;Cheis,&quot; meaning &quot;having the quality of oak&quot;) and, after his death, his sons Tahzay and, later, Naiche, under the guardianship of Cochise&#x27;s war chief and brother-in-law Nahilzay, and the independent chiefs Chihuahua, Ulzana, Skinya and Pionsenay; Tchihende (Mimbreño) people was led, during the same period, by chiefs as Juan José Compa, Fuerte also known as Soldado Fiero, Mangas Coloradas, Cuchillo Negro, Delgadito, Ponce, Nana, Victorio, Loco, Mangus; Ndendahe (Mogollón and Carrizaleño / Janero) Apache people, in the meanwhile, was led by Mahko and, after him, Mano Mocha, Coleto Amarillo, Luis, Laceres, Felipe, Natiza, and finally Juh and &quot;Goyaałé&quot; (known to the Americans as Geronimo). After Victorio&#x27;s death, Nana, Gerónimo, Mangus (youngest Mangas Coloradas&#x27; son) and youngest Cochise&#x27;s son &quot;Naiche&quot; were the last leaders of the Central Apaches, and their mixed Apache group was the last to continue to resist U.S. government control of the American Southwest.

===European-Apache relations===
From the beginning of European-Apache relations, there was conflict between them. The two groups contested the control of land and trade routes in Apacheria, and their cultural differences made it oftentimes difficult to negotiate treaties and policies between. Their encounters were preceded by more than 100 years of Spanish colonial and Mexican incursions and settlement on the Apache lands, which pushed Apache tribes northward and exacerbated the martial nature of their society. The United States settlers were newcomers to the competition for land and resources in the Southwest, but they inherited its complex history, and brought their own attitudes with them about American Indians and how to use the land. By the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, the US took on the responsibility to prevent and punish cross-border incursions by Apache who were raiding in Mexico.

The Apache viewed the United States colonists with ambivalence, and in some cases enlisted them as allies in the early years against the Mexicans. In 1852, the US and some of the Chiricahua signed a treaty, but it had little lasting effect. During the 1850s, American miners and settlers began moving into Chiricahua territory, beginning encroachment that had been renewed in the migration to the Southwest of the previous two decades.

This forced the Apachean people to change their lives as nomads, free on the land. The US Army defeated them and forced them into the confinement of reservation life, on lands ill-suited for subsistence farming, which the US proffered as the model of civilization. Today, the Chiricahua are preserving their culture as much as possible, while forging new relationships with the peoples around them. The Chiricahua are a living and vibrant culture, a part of the greater American whole and yet distinct based on their history and culture.

===Hostilities===
Although they had lived peaceably with most Americans in the New Mexico Territory up to about 1860, the Chiricahua became increasingly hostile to American encroachment in the Southwest after a number of provocations had occurred between them.

In 1835, Mexico had placed a bounty on Apache scalps which further inflamed the situation. In 1837 Warm Springs Mimbreños&#x27; head chief and famed raider, Soldado Fiero also known as Fuerte was killed by Mexican soldiers of the garrison at Janos (only two days&#x27; travel from Santa Rita del Cobre), and his son Cuchillo Negro succeeded him as head chief and went to war against Chihuahua for revenge. In the same 1837, the American John (also known as James) Johnson invited the Coppermine Mimbreños in the Pinos Altos area to trade with his party (near the mines at Santa Rita del Cobre, New Mexico) and, when they gathered around a blanket on which &quot;pinole&quot; (a ground corn flour) had been placed for them, Johnson and his men opened fire on the Chihenne with rifles and a concealed cannon loaded with scrap iron, glass, and a length of chain. They killed about 20 Apache, including the chief Juan José Compá. Mangas Coloradas is said to have witnessed this attack, which inflamed his and other Apache warriors&#x27; desires for vengeance for many years; he led the survivors to safety and subsequently, together with Cuchillo Negro, took Mimbreño revenge. The historian Rex W. Strickland argued that the Apache had come to the meeting with their own intentions of attacking Johnson&#x27;s party, but were taken by surprise. In 1839 scalp-hunter James Kirker was employed by Robert McKnight to re-open the road to Santa Rita del Cobre.

After the conclusion of the US/Mexican War (1848) and the Gadsden Purchase (1853), Americans began to enter the territory in greater numbers. This increased the opportunities for incidents and misunderstandings. The Apaches, including Mangas Coloradas and Cuchillo Negro, were not at first hostile to the Americans, considering them enemies of their own Mexican enemies.

Cuchillo Negro, with Ponce, Delgadito, Victorio and other Mimbreño chiefs, signed a treaty at Fort Webster in April 1853, but, during the spring of 1857 the U.S. Army set out on a campaign, led by Col. Benjamin L.E. deBonneville, Col. Dixon S. Miles (3°Cavalry from Fort Thorn) and Col. William W. Loring (commanding a Mounted Rifles Regiment from Albuquerque), against Mogollon and Coyotero Apaches: Loring&#x27;s Pueblo Indian scouts found and attacked an Apache rancheria in the Canyon de Los Muertos Carneros (May 25, 1857), where Cuchillo Negro and some Mimbreño Apache were resting after a raid against the Navahos. Some Apaches, including Cuchillo Negro himself, were killed.

In December 1860, after several bad incidents provoked by the miners led by James H. Tevis in the Pinos Altos area, &quot;Mangas Coloradas&quot; went to Pinos Altos, New Mexico to try to convince the miners to move away from the area he loved and to go to the Sierra Madre and seek gold there, but they tied him to a tree and whipped him badly. His Mimbreño and Ndendahe followers and related Chiricahua bands were incensed by the treatment of their respected chief. Mangas had been just as great a chief in his prime (during the 1830s and 1840s), along with Cuchillo Negro, as Cochise was then becoming.

In 1861, the US Army seized and killed some of Cochise&#x27;s relatives near Apache Pass, in what became known as the Bascom Affair. Remembering how Cochise had escaped, the Chiricahua called the incident &quot;cut the tent.&quot; In 1863, Gen. James H. Carleton set out leading a new campaign against the Mescalero Apache, and Capt. Edmund Shirland (10°California Cavalry) invited Mangas Coloradas for a &quot;parley&quot; but, after he entered the U.S. camp to negotiate a peace, the great Mimbreño chief was arrested and convicted in Fort McLane, where, probably on Gen. Joseph R. West&#x27;s orders, Mangas Coloradas was killed by American soldiers (Jan. 18, 1863). His body was mutilated by the soldiers, and his people were enraged by his murder. The Chiricahuas began to consider the Americans as &quot;enemies we go against them.&quot; From that time, they waged almost constant war against US settlers and the Army for the next 23 years. Cochise, his brother-in-law Nahilzay (war chief of Cochise&#x27;s people), Chihuahua, Skinya, Pionsenay, Ulzana and other warring chiefs became a nightmare to settlers and military garrisons and patrols. In the meantime, the great Victorio, Delgadito (soon killed in 1864), Nana, Loco, young Mangus (last son of Mangas Coloradas) and other minor chiefs led on the warpath the Mimbreños, Chiricahuas&#x27; cousins and allies, and Juh led the Ndendahe (Nednhi and Bedonkohe together).

In 1872, General Oliver O. Howard, with the help of Thomas Jeffords, succeeded in negotiating a peace with Cochise. On December 14, 1872, President Ulysses Grant issued an Executive Order establishing the Chiricahua Reservation in the southeast Arizona Territory encompassing the Chiricahua Mountains, Mexico–United States border, and New Mexico Territory border. Jeffords and John Clum were designated as the U.S. Indian Agents for the Chiricahua Reservation residing near Apache Pass, Arizona and Fort Bowie. It remained open for about 4 years, during which the chief Cochise died (from natural causes). In 1876, about two years after Cochise&#x27;s death, the US moved the Chiricahua and some other Apache bands to the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, still in Arizona. This was in response to public outcry after the killings of Orizoba Spence and Nicholas Rogers at Sulpher Springs. The mountain people hated the desert environment of San Carlos, and some frequently began to leave the reservation and sometimes raided neighboring settlers.

They surrendered to General Nelson Miles in 1886. The best-known warrior leader of the &quot;renegades&quot;, although he was not considered a &#x27;chief&#x27;, was the forceful and influential Geronimo. He and &quot;Naiche&quot; (the son of Cochise and hereditary leader after Tahzay&#x27;s death) together led many of the resisters during those last few years of freedom.
They made a stronghold in the Chiricahua Mountains, part of which is now inside Chiricahua National Monument, and across the intervening Willcox Playa to the northeast, in the Dragoon Mountains (all in southeastern Arizona). In late frontier times, the Chiricahua ranged from San Carlos and the White Mountains of Arizona, to the adjacent mountains of southwestern New Mexico around what is now Silver City, and down into the mountain sanctuaries of the Sierra Madre (of northern Mexico). There they often joined with their &quot;Nednai&quot; Apache kin.

General George Crook, then General Miles&#x27; troops, aided by Apache scouts from other groups, pursued the exiles until they gave up. Mexico and the United States had negotiated an agreement allowing their troops in pursuit of the Apache to continue into each other&#x27;s territories. This prevented the Chiricahua groups from using the border as an escape route, and as they could gain little time to rest and consider their next move, the fatigue, attrition and demoralization of the constant hunt led to their surrender.

The final 34 hold-outs, including Geronimo and Naiche, surrendered to units of General Miles&#x27; forces in September 1886. From Bowie Station, Arizona, they were entrained, along with most of the other remaining Chiricahua (as well as the Army&#x27;s Apache scouts), and exiled to Fort Marion, Florida. At least two Apache warriors, Massai and Gray Lizard, escaped from their prison car and made their way back to San Carlos Arizona in a journey to their ancestral lands.

After a number of Chiricahua deaths at the Fort Marion prison near St. Augustine, Florida, the survivors were moved, first to Alabama, and later to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Geronimo&#x27;s surrender ended the Indian Wars in the United States. However, another group of Chiricahua (also known as the &quot;Nameless Ones&quot; or &quot;Bronco Apache&quot;) were not captured by U.S. forces and refused to surrender. They escaped over the border to Mexico, and settled in the remote Sierra Madre mountains. There they built hidden camps, raided homes for cattle and other food supplies, and engaged in periodic firefights with units of the Mexican Army and police. Most were eventually captured or killed by soldiers or by private ranchers armed and deputized by the Mexican government.

Eventually, the surviving Chiricahua prisoners were moved to the Fort Sill military reservation in Oklahoma. In August 1912, by an act of the U.S. Congress, they were released from their prisoner of war status as they were thought to be no further threat. Although promised land at Fort Sill, they met resistance from local non-Apache. They were given the choice to remain at Fort Sill or to relocate to the Mescalero reservation near Ruidoso, New Mexico. Two-thirds of the group, 183 people, elected to go to New Mexico, while 78 remained in Oklahoma. Their descendants still reside in these places. At the time, they were not permitted to return to Arizona because of hostility from the long wars.
in 1912 many different Apache bands returned to San Carlos Apache lands after their release from Fort Sill Apache Reservation.

==Bands==


In the Chiricahua culture, the &quot;band&quot; as a unit was much more important than the
American or European concept of &quot;tribe&quot;. The Chiricahua had no name for themselves (autonym) as a people. The name Chiricahua is most likely the Spanish rendering of the Opata word &quot;Chihuicahui or Chiguicagui&quot; (&#x27;mountain of the wild turkey&#x27;) for the Chiricahua Mountains, later corrupted into Chiricahui/Chiricahua. The Chiricahua tribal territory encompassed today&#x27;s SE Arizona, SW New Mexico, NE Sonora and NW Chihuahua. The Chiricahua range extended to the east as far as the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico and to the west as far as the San Pedro River Valley in Arizona, north of Magdalena just below present day Hwy I-40 corridor in New Mexico and with the town Ciudad Madera (276 km northwest of the state capital, Chihuahua, and 536 km southwest of Ciudad Juárez (formerly known as Paso del Norte) on the Mexico–United States border), as their southernmost range.

According to Morris E. Opler (1941), the Chiricahuas consisted of three bands:
* Chíhéne or Chííhénee’ &#x27;Red Paint People&#x27; (also known as Eastern Chiricahua, Warm Springs Apache, &quot;Gileños&quot;, &quot;Ojo Caliente&quot; Apache, Coppermine Apache, Copper Mine, &quot;Mimbreños&quot;, &quot;Mimbres&quot;, Mogollones, Tcihende),
* Ch&#x27;úk&#x27;ánéń or Ch&#x27;uuk&#x27;anén ‘Ridge of the Mountainside People’ (also known as Central Chiricahua, &quot;Ch&#x27;ók&#x27;ánéń&quot;, Cochise Apache, &quot;Chiricahua&quot; proper, Chiricaguis, &quot;Tcokanene&quot;), or the Sunrise People;
* Ndé&#x27;indaaí or Nédnaa&#x27;í &#x27;Enemy People&#x27; or &#x27;The Apache People (who live among) Enemies&#x27; known as the Southern Chiricahua, Pinery Apache, Bronco Apache, &quot;Ne&#x27;na&#x27;i&quot;), or &quot;those ahead at the end&quot;.

Schroeder (1947) lists five bands:
* Mogollon
* Copper Mine
* Mimbres
* Warm Spring
* Chiricahua proper

The Chiricahua-Warm Springs Fort Sill Apache tribe in Oklahoma say they have four bands in Fort Sill: (some of the Arizona Apaches did not return to San Carlos or Fort Apache, White Mountain Apache warrior Eyelash is buried in Fort Sill cememtry, Southern Tonto Apache Chief/Scout Hosay is buried in Fort Apache cememtery, Hosay has family in Fort Sill and San Carlos today)
* Chíhéne (recte &quot;Tchi-he-nde&quot;, more correctly known as the Warm Springs and Coppermine Mimbreño bands, &quot;Chinde&quot;),
* Chukunen (recte &quot;Tsoka-ne-nde&quot;, also known as the Chiricahua band, Chokonende),
* Bidánku (recte &quot;Bedonkohe Ndendahe&quot;, also known as Bidanku, Bronco),
* Ndéndai (recte &quot;Nednhi Ndendahe&quot;, also known as Ndénai, Nednai).
Today they use the word Chidikáágu (derived from the Spanish word &quot;Chiricahua&quot;) to refer to the Chiricahua in general, and the word Indé, to refer to the Apache in general.

Other sources list these and additional bands (only the Chokonen and Chihuicahui local groups of the Chokonen band were considered by Chiricahua tribal members to be &quot;the real Chiricahua people&quot;):
* Chokonen, Chukunende or Tsokanende (also known as &quot;Ch’ók’ánéń, Tsoka-ne-nde, Tcokanene, Chu-ku-nde, Chukunen, Ch’úk’ánéń, Ch’uuk’anén, Chuukonende&quot; or &quot;Ch&#x27;úk&#x27;ânéõne&quot; – ‘Ridge of the Mountainside People’, &quot;proper&quot; or Central Chiricahua)

*** Janeros local group (also known as &quot;real Nednhi&quot;, lived in NW Chihuahua and NE Sonora, south into the Sierra San Luis, Sierra del Tigre, Sierra de Carcay, Sierra de Boca Grande, west beyond the Aros River to Bavispe, east along the Janos River and Casas Grandes River toward the Lake Guzmán in the northern part of the Guzmán Basin, because they traded at the presidio of Janos they were called &quot;Janeros Apache&quot;, because they preferred living in the nearly inaccessible Sierra Madre Occidental, their autonym for themselves was &quot;Dzilthdaklizhénde&quot; or &quot;Dził Dklishende&quot; – ′Blue Mountain People, i.e. People of the Sierra Madre′, northern local group – headed by Juh)
*** Tu-ntsa-nde local group (′Big Water People, i.e. People along the Aros River′, their stronghold called &quot;Guaynopa&quot; was in the bend of the Papigochic River (Aros River) east of the border of Sonora in the vicinity of a mountain, which called the Apache &quot;Dzil-da-na-tal&quot; – ′Mountain Holding Head Up And Peering Out′, smallest local group)
*** Haiahende local group (′People of the Rising Sun, i.e. People of the East′, lived in the Peloncillo Mountains, Animas Mountains and Florida Mountains in SE Arizona and in New Mexico Bootheel and south into the deserts and mountains of NE of Sonora and the Mexican Plateau in NW Chihuahua, eastern local group)
*** Hakaye local group (were part of Sierra Madre Mountains of Sonora Mexico)
** Carrizaleños local group (known by other Chiricahua as &quot;Gol-ga-he-ne&quot; – ′Open Place People′ or &quot;Gul-ga-ki&quot; – ′Prairie Dog People′, lived exclusively in Chihuahua, between the presidios of Janos in the west and Carrizal and Lake Santa Maria in the east, south toward Corralitos, Casas Grandes and Agua Nuevas north of Chihuahua, controlled the southern part of the Guzmán Basin, and the mountains along the Casas Grandes, Santa Maria and Carmen River, likely called &quot;Tsebekinéndé&quot;&#x27;Stone House People&#x27; or &#x27;Rock House People&#x27;, southeastern group)
** Pinaleños / Pinery local group (lived south of Bavispe, between the Bavispe River and Aros River in NE Sonora and NW Chihuahua, controlled the Sierra Huachinera, Sierra de los Alisos and Sierra Nacori Chico, the mountains had a large stock of Apache Pine foresthence they were called &quot;Pinaleños / Pinery Apaches&quot;, southwestern local group).

The Chokonen, Chihenne, Nednhi, and Bedonkohe had probably up to three other groups, named respectively after their leaders or homelands. By the end of the 19th century, surviving Apache no longer identified these groups. They may have been wiped out (like the Pinaleño-Nednhi) or had joined more powerful groups. For instance, the remnant of the Carrizaleño-Nedhni camped together with their northern kin, the Janero-Nednhi.

The Carrizaleňo-Nednhi shared overlapping territory in the surroundings of Casas Grandes and Aguas Nuevas with the &quot;Tsebekinéndé&quot;, a southern Mescalero band (which was often called &quot;Aguas Nuevas&quot; by the Spanish). The Spanish referred to the Apache band by the same name of Tsebekinéndé. These two different Apache bands were often confused with each other. (Similar confusion arose over distinguishing the Janeros-Nednhi of the Chiricahua (&quot;Dzilthdaklizhéndé&quot;) and the &quot;Dzithinahndé&quot; of the Mescalero.

<doc id="44055" wikidata="Q516776" url="?curid=44055" title="Measurable function">
<text>In mathematics, and in particular measure theory, a measurable function is a function between the underlying sets of two measurable spaces that preserves the structure of the spaces: the preimage of any measurable set is measurable. This is in direct analogy to the definition that a continuous function between topological spaces preserves the topological structure: the preimage of any open set is open. In real analysis, measurable functions are used in the definition of the Lebesgue integral. In probability theory, a measurable function on a probability space is known as a random variable.

== Formal definition ==

Let formula_1 and formula_2 be measurable spaces, meaning that formula_3 and formula_4 are sets equipped with respective formula_5-algebras formula_6 and formula_7 A function formula_8 is said to be measurable if for every formula_9 the pre-image of formula_10 under formula_11 is in formula_6; that is, for all formula_13
formula_14

That is, formula_15 where formula_16 is the σ-algebra generated by f. If formula_8 is a measurable function, one writes
formula_18
to emphasize the dependency on the formula_5-algebras formula_6 and formula_7

== Term usage variations ==

The choice of formula_5-algebras in the definition above is sometimes implicit and left up to the context. For example, for formula_23 formula_24 or other topological spaces, the Borel algebra (generated by all the open sets) is a common choice. Some authors define measurable functions as exclusively real-valued ones with respect to the Borel algebra.

If the values of the function lie in an infinite-dimensional vector space, other non-equivalent definitions of measurability, such as weak measurability and Bochner measurability, exist.

== Notable classes of measurable functions ==

* Random variables are by definition measurable functions defined on probability spaces.
* If formula_25 and formula_26 are Borel spaces, a measurable function formula_27 is also called a Borel function. Continuous functions are Borel functions but not all Borel functions are continuous. However, a measurable function is nearly a continuous function; see Luzin&#x27;s theorem. If a Borel function happens to be a section of a map formula_28 it is called a Borel section.
* A Lebesgue measurable function is a measurable function formula_29 where formula_30 is the formula_5-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets, and formula_32 is the Borel algebra on the complex numbers formula_33 Lebesgue measurable functions are of interest in mathematical analysis because they can be integrated. In the case formula_34 formula_11 is Lebesgue measurable if and only if formula_36 is measurable for all formula_37 This is also equivalent to any of formula_38 being measurable for all formula_39 or the preimage of any open set being measurable. Continuous functions, monotone functions, step functions, semicontinuous functions, Riemann-integrable functions, and functions of bounded variation are all Lebesgue measurable. A function formula_40 is measurable if and only if the real and imaginary parts are measurable.

== Properties of measurable functions ==

* The sum and product of two complex-valued measurable functions are measurable. So is the quotient, so long as there is no division by zero.
* If formula_41 and formula_42 are measurable functions, then so is their composition formula_43
* If formula_41 and formula_45 are measurable functions, their composition formula_46 need not be formula_47-measurable unless formula_48 Indeed, two Lebesgue-measurable functions may be constructed in such a way as to make their composition non-Lebesgue-measurable.
* The (pointwise) supremum, infimum, limit superior, and limit inferior of a sequence (viz., countably many) of real-valued measurable functions are all measurable as well.
*The pointwise limit of a sequence of measurable functions formula_49 is measurable, where formula_50 is a metric space (endowed with the Borel algebra). This is not true in general if formula_50 is non-metrizable. The corresponding statement for continuous functions requires stronger conditions than pointwise convergence, such as uniform convergence.

== Non-measurable functions ==

Real-valued functions encountered in applications tend to be measurable; however, it is not difficult to prove the existence of non-measurable functions. Such proofs rely on the axiom of choice in an essential way, in the sense that Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice does not prove the existence of such functions.

In any measure space &quot;formula_25&quot; with a non-measurable set formula_53 formula_54 one can construct a non-measurable indicator function: 
formula_55
where formula_56 is equipped with the usual Borel algebra. This is a non-measurable function since the preimage of the measurable set formula_57 is the non-measurable formula_58  

As another example, any non-constant function formula_59 is non-measurable with respect to the trivial formula_5-algebra formula_61 since the preimage of any point in the range is some proper, nonempty subset of formula_62 which is not an element of the trivial formula_63

<text>MD Data is a type of magneto-optical medium derived from MiniDisc. 

In developing and marketing it, Sony was trying to set the new standard for removable media to replace the 3½-inch diskette it had also helped create. MD Data competed in a format war with other disks such as SyQuest&#x27;s EZ 135, Imation&#x27;s SuperDisk, and the Iomega Zip. Ultimately neither MD Data nor any of its competitors succeeded in becoming the de facto new universal standard fully replacing the 3.5 inch diskette; with recordable CDs coming closest to filling the role, followed by USB flash drives.

==Overview==
MD Data disks can be fully read-only, fully rewritable, or be a hybrid of the two, with a portion of a disk being read-only and while another is rewritable.

With 140 MB disks, MD Data offered about 100 times as much storage capacity as ordinary diskettes, and more than its competitors like the Zip (100 MB), SuperDisk (120 MB), and EZ 135 (135 MB), in a physically smaller medium.

The format was featured in products such as still cameras, a PDA, document scanners, and image storage and editing systems.

Another use was in 4- and 8-track multitrack recording decks. Meant as a step up from the popular 4-track cassette-based studios, these recorders enjoyed a brief prominence before they were replaced by relatively affordable and far more flexible direct-to-hard drive recording on Windows and Macintosh based computers. Some examples of products that used the format are a few multitrack &quot;portastudio&quot;-style audio recorders such as Sony&#x27;s MDM-X4 and Tascam&#x27;s 564.

Sony&#x27;s MDH-10 MD Data disk drive, meant for use with Windows and Mac PCs, could also play back audio MiniDiscs. However, the drive was expensive compared to the Zip drive and others. 

== MD Data2 ==

In 1997, Sony introduced the MD Data2 format at 650 MB. The only product that used the format was Sony&#x27;s DCM-M1 camcorder (capable of still images and MPEG-2 video).

== Hi-MD ==
Hi-MD, introduced in 2004 allows 340MB or 1GB of any type of data to be stored on a Hi-MD formatted MiniDisc, succeeding MD Data and MD Data2.

<text>Galactic astronomy is the study of the Milky Way galaxy and all its contents. This is in contrast to extragalactic astronomy, which is the study of everything outside our galaxy, including all other galaxies.

Galactic astronomy should not be confused with galaxy formation and evolution, which is the general study of galaxies, their formation, structure, components, dynamics, interactions, and the range of forms they take.

The Milky Way galaxy, where the Solar System is located, is in many ways the best-studied galaxy, although important parts of it are obscured from view in visible wavelengths by regions of cosmic dust. The development of radio astronomy, infrared astronomy and submillimetre astronomy in the 20th century allowed the gas and dust of the Milky Way to be mapped for the first time.

== Subcategories ==
A standard set of subcategories is used by astronomical journals to split up the subject of Galactic Astronomy:
# abundances – the study of the location of elements heavier than helium
# bulge – the study of the bulge around the center of the Milky Way
# center – the study of the central region of the Milky Way
# disk – the study of the Milky Way disk (the plane upon which most galactic objects are aligned)
# evolution – the evolution of the Milky Way
# formation – the formation of the Milky Way
# fundamental parameters – the fundamental parameters of the Milky Way (mass, size etc.)
# globular cluster – globular clusters within the Milky Way
# halo – the large halo around the Milky Way
# kinematics, and dynamics – the motions of stars and clusters
# nucleus – the region around the black hole at the center of the Milky Way (Sagittarius A*)
# open clusters and associations – open clusters and associations of stars
# Solar neighborhood – nearby stars
# stellar content – numbers and types of stars in the Milky Way
# structure – the structure (spiral arms etc.)

== Stellar populations ==

<text>In physical cosmology, Big Bang nucleosynthesis (also known as primordial nucleosynthesis, and abbreviated as BBN) is a model for the production of light nuclei, deuterium, 3He, 4He, 7Li, between 0.01s and 200s in the lifetime of the universe.
The model uses a combination of thermodynamic arguments and results from equations for the expansion of the universe to define a changing temperature and density, then analyzes the rates of nuclear reactions at these temperatures and densities to predict the nuclear abundance ratios. Refined models agree very well with observations with the exception of the abundance of 7Li. The model is one of the key concepts in standard cosmology.

Elements heavier than lithium are thought to have been created later in the life of the Universe by stellar nucleosynthesis, through the formation, evolution and death of stars.

==Characteristics==
The Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) model assumes a homogeneous plasma, at a temperature corresponding to 1 MeV, consisting of electrons annihilating with positrons to produce photons. In turn, the photons pair to produce electrons and positrons: formula_1.
These particles are in equilibrium. A similar number of neutrinos, also at 1 MeV, have just dropped out of equilibrium at this density. Finally, there is a very low density of baryons (neutrons and protons). The BBN model follows the nuclear reactions of these baryons as the temperature and pressure drops due to expansion of the universe.

The basic model makes two simplifying assumptions: 
# until the temperature drops below 0.1 MeV only neutrons and protons are stable and 
# only isotopes of hydrogen and of helium will be produced at the end.
These assumptions are based on the intense flux of high energy photons in the plasma. Above 0.1 MeV every nucleus created is blasted apart by a photon.
Thus the model first determines the ratio of neutrons to protons and uses this as an input to calculate the hydrogen, deuterium, tritium, and 3He.

The model follows nuclear reaction rates as the temperature and density drops.
The evolving density and temperature follow from the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model.
Around formula_2 MeV, the density of neutrinos drops, and reactions like
formula_3
which maintained neutron and proton equilibrium, slow down.
The neutron-to-proton ratio decreases to around 1/7.

As the temperature and density continue to fall, reactions involving combinations of protons and neutrons shift towards heavier nuclei. These include
formula_4
Due to the higher binding energy of He, the free neutrons and the deuterium nuclei are largely consumed, leaving mostly protons and helium.

The fusion of nuclei occurred between roughly 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the Big Bang; this corresponds to the temperature range when the universe was cool enough for deuterium to survive, but hot and dense enough for fusion reactions to occur at a significant rate.

The key parameter which allows one to calculate the effects of Big Bang nucleosynthesis is the baryon/photon number ratio, which is a small number of order 6 × 10−10. This parameter corresponds to the baryon density and controls the rate at which nucleons collide and react; from this it is possible to calculate element abundances after nucleosynthesis ends. Although the baryon per photon ratio is important in determining element abundances, the precise value makes little difference to the overall picture. Without major changes to the Big Bang theory itself, BBN will result in mass abundances of about 75% of hydrogen-1, about 25% helium-4, about 0.01% of deuterium and helium-3, trace amounts (on the order of 10−10) of lithium, and negligible heavier elements. That the observed abundances in the universe are generally consistent with these abundance numbers is considered strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.

==History==
The history of Big Bang nucleosynthesis began a proposal in the 1940s by George Gamow that nuclear reactions during a hot initial phase of the universe produced the observed hydrogen and helium. Calculations by his student Ralph Alpher were published in the famous Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper outlined a theory of light-element production in the early universe. The first detailed calculations of the primordial isotopic abundances came in 1966 and have been refined over the years using updated estimates of the input nuclear reaction rates. The first systematic Monte Carlo study of how nuclear reaction rate uncertainties impact isotope predictions, over the relevant temperature range, was carried out in 1993.

==Important parameters==
The creation of light elements during BBN was dependent on a number of parameters; among those was the neutron–proton ratio (calculable from Standard Model physics) and the baryon-photon ratio.

===Neutron–proton ratio===
The neutron–proton ratio was set by Standard Model physics before the nucleosynthesis era, 
essentially within the first 1-second after the Big Bang. 
Neutrons can react with positrons or electron neutrinos to create protons and other products in one of the following reactions:
:&lt;chem&gt;n \ + e+ &lt;=&gt; \overline{\nu}_e + p &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;n \ + \nu_{e} &lt;=&gt; p + e- &lt;/chem&gt;

At times much earlier than 1 sec, these reactions were fast and maintained the n/p ratio close to 1:1. As the temperature dropped, the equilibrium shifted in favour of protons due to their slightly lower mass, and the n/p ratio smoothly decreased. 
These reactions continued until the decreasing temperature and density caused the reactions to become too slow, which occurred at about T = 0.7 MeV (time around 1 second) and is called the freeze out temperature. At freeze out, the neutron–proton ratio was about 1/6. However, free neutrons are unstable with a mean life of 880 sec; some neutrons decayed in the next few minutes before fusing into any nucleus, so the ratio of total neutrons to protons after nucleosynthesis ends is about 1/7. Almost all neutrons that fused instead of decaying ended up combined into helium-4, due to the fact that helium-4 has the highest binding energy per nucleon among light elements. This predicts that about 8% of all atoms should be helium-4, leading to a mass fraction of helium-4 of about 25%, which is in line with observations. Small traces of deuterium and helium-3 remained as there was insufficient time and density for them to react and form helium-4.

===Baryon–photon ratio===
The baryon–photon ratio, η, is the key parameter determining the abundances of light elements after nucleosynthesis ends. Baryons and light elements can fuse in the following main reactions:

along with some other low-probability reactions leading to 7Li or 7Be. 
(An important feature is that there are no stable nuclei with mass 5 or 8, which implies that reactions adding one baryon to 4He, or fusing two 4He, do not occur). 
Most fusion chains during BBN ultimately terminate in 4He (helium-4), while &quot;incomplete&quot; reaction chains lead to small amounts of left-over 2H or 3He; the amount of these decreases with increasing baryon-photon ratio. That is, the larger the baryon-photon ratio the more reactions there will be and the more efficiently deuterium will be eventually transformed into helium-4. This result makes deuterium a very useful tool in measuring the baryon-to-photon ratio.

==Sequence==

Big Bang nucleosynthesis began roughly about 20 seconds after the big bang, when the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow deuterium nuclei to survive disruption by high-energy photons. (Note that the neutron–proton freeze-out time was earlier). This time is essentially independent of dark matter content, since the universe was highly radiation dominated until much later, and this dominant component controls the temperature/time relation. At this time there were about six protons for every neutron, but a small fraction of the neutrons decay before fusing in the next few hundred seconds, so at the end of nucleosynthesis there are about seven protons to every neutron, and almost all the neutrons are in Helium-4 nuclei.

One feature of BBN is that the physical laws and constants that govern the behavior of matter at these energies are very well understood, and hence BBN lacks some of the speculative uncertainties that characterize earlier periods in the life of the universe. Another feature is that the process of nucleosynthesis is determined by conditions at the start of this phase of the life of the universe, and proceeds independently of what happened before.

As the universe expands, it cools. Free neutrons are less stable than helium nuclei, and the protons and neutrons have a strong tendency to form helium-4. However, forming helium-4 requires the intermediate step of forming deuterium. Before nucleosynthesis began, the temperature was high enough for many photons to have energy greater than the binding energy of deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed (a situation known as the &quot;deuterium bottleneck&quot;). Hence, the formation of helium-4 was delayed until the universe became cool enough for deuterium to survive (at about T = 0.1 MeV); after which there was a sudden burst of element formation. However, very shortly thereafter, around twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and density became too low for any significant fusion to occur. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, and the only changes were the result of the radioactive decay of the two major unstable products of BBN, tritium and beryllium-7.

===Heavy elements===

Big Bang nucleosynthesis produced very few nuclei of elements heavier than lithium due to a bottleneck: the absence of a stable nucleus with 8 or 5 nucleons. This deficit of larger atoms also limited the amounts of lithium-7 produced during BBN. In stars, the bottleneck is passed by triple collisions of helium-4 nuclei, producing carbon (the triple-alpha process). However, this process is very slow and requires much higher densities, taking tens of thousands of years to convert a significant amount of helium to carbon in stars, and therefore it made a negligible contribution in the minutes following the Big Bang.

The predicted abundance of CNO isotopes produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis is expected to be on the order of 10−15 that of H, making them essentially undetectable and negligible. Indeed, none of these primordial isotopes of the elements from beryllium to oxygen have yet been detected, although those of beryllium and boron may be able to be detected in the future. So far, the only stable nuclides known experimentally to have been made during Big Bang nucleosynthesis are protium, deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.

===Helium-4===
Big Bang nucleosynthesis predicts a primordial abundance of about 25% helium-4 by mass, irrespective of the initial conditions of the universe. As long as the universe was hot enough for protons and neutrons to transform into each other easily, their ratio, determined solely by their relative masses, was about 1 neutron to 7 protons (allowing for some decay of neutrons into protons). Once it was cool enough, the neutrons quickly bound with an equal number of protons to form first deuterium, then helium-4. Helium-4 is very stable and is nearly the end of this chain if it runs for only a short time, since helium neither decays nor combines easily to form heavier nuclei (since there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of 5 or 8, helium does not combine easily with either protons, or with itself). Once temperatures are lowered, out of every 16 nucleons (2 neutrons and 14 protons), 4 of these (25% of the total particles and total mass) combine quickly into one helium-4 nucleus. This produces one helium for every 12 hydrogens, resulting in a universe that is a little over 8% helium by number of atoms, and 25% helium by mass.

&quot;One analogy is to think of helium-4 as ash, and the amount of ash that one forms when one completely burns a piece of wood is insensitive to how one burns it.&quot; The resort to the BBN theory of the helium-4 abundance is necessary as there is far more helium-4 in the universe than can be explained by stellar nucleosynthesis. In addition, it provides an important test for the Big Bang theory. If the observed helium abundance is significantly different from 25%, then this would pose a serious challenge to the theory. This would particularly be the case if the early helium-4 abundance was much smaller than 25% because it is hard to destroy helium-4. For a few years during the mid-1990s, observations suggested that this might be the case, causing astrophysicists to talk about a Big Bang nucleosynthetic crisis, but further observations were consistent with the Big Bang theory.

===Deuterium===
Deuterium is in some ways the opposite of helium-4, in that while helium-4 is very stable and difficult to destroy, deuterium is only marginally stable and easy to destroy. The temperatures, time, and densities were sufficient to combine a substantial fraction of the deuterium nuclei to form helium-4 but insufficient to carry the process further using helium-4 in the next fusion step. BBN did not convert all of the deuterium in the universe to helium-4 due to the expansion that cooled the universe and reduced the density, and so cut that conversion short before it could proceed any further. One consequence of this is that, unlike helium-4, the amount of deuterium is very sensitive to initial conditions. The denser the initial universe was, the more deuterium would be converted to helium-4 before time ran out, and the less deuterium would remain.

There are no known post-Big Bang processes which can produce significant amounts of deuterium. Hence observations about deuterium abundance suggest that the universe is not infinitely old, which is in accordance with the Big Bang theory.

During the 1970s, there were major efforts to find processes that could produce deuterium, but those revealed ways of producing isotopes other than deuterium. The problem was that while the concentration of deuterium in the universe is consistent with the Big Bang model as a whole, it is too high to be consistent with a model that presumes that most of the universe is composed of protons and neutrons. If one assumes that all of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, the density of the universe is such that much of the currently observed deuterium would have been burned into helium-4. The standard explanation now used for the abundance of deuterium is that the universe does not consist mostly of baryons, but that non-baryonic matter (also known as dark matter) makes up most of the mass of the universe. This explanation is also consistent with calculations that show that a universe made mostly of protons and neutrons would be far more &quot;clumpy&quot; than is observed.

It is very hard to come up with another process that would produce deuterium other than by nuclear fusion. Such a process would require that the temperature be hot enough to produce deuterium, but not hot enough to produce helium-4, and that this process should immediately cool to non-nuclear temperatures after no more than a few minutes. It would also be necessary for the deuterium to be swept away before it reoccurs.

Producing deuterium by fission is also difficult. The problem here again is that deuterium is very unlikely due to nuclear processes, and that collisions between atomic nuclei are likely to result either in the fusion of the nuclei, or in the release of free neutrons or alpha particles. During the 1970s, cosmic ray spallation was proposed as a source of deuterium. That theory failed to account for the abundance of deuterium, but led to explanations of the source of other light elements.

===Lithium===

Lithium-7 and lithium-6 produced in the Big Bang are on the order of: lithium-7 to be 10−9 of all primordial nuclides; and lithium-6 around 10−13.

==Measurements and status of theory==
The theory of BBN gives a detailed mathematical description of the production of the light &quot;elements&quot; deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7. Specifically, the theory yields precise quantitative predictions for the mixture of these elements, that is, the primordial abundances at the end of the big-bang.

In order to test these predictions, it is necessary to reconstruct the primordial abundances as faithfully as possible, for instance by observing astronomical objects in which very little stellar nucleosynthesis has taken place (such as certain dwarf galaxies) or by observing objects that are very far away, and thus can be seen in a very early stage of their evolution (such as distant quasars).

As noted above, in the standard picture of BBN, all of the light element abundances depend on the amount of ordinary matter (baryons) relative to radiation (photons). Since the universe is presumed to be homogeneous, it has one unique value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. For a long time, this meant that to test BBN theory against observations one had to ask: can &quot;all&quot; of the light element observations be explained with a &quot;single value&quot; of the baryon-to-photon ratio? Or more precisely, allowing for the finite precision of both the predictions and the observations, one asks: is there some &quot;range&quot; of baryon-to-photon values which can account for all of the observations?

More recently, the question has changed: Precision observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck give an independent value for the baryon-to-photon ratio. 
The present measurement of helium-4 indicates good agreement, and yet better agreement for helium-3. But for lithium-7, there is a significant discrepancy between BBN and WMAP/Planck, and the abundance derived from Population II stars. The discrepancy, called the &quot;cosmological lithium problem&quot;, is a factor of 2.4―4.3 below the theoretically predicted value. that have resulted in revised calculations of the standard BBN based on new nuclear data, and to various reevaluation proposals for primordial proton–proton nuclear reactions, especially the abundances of , versus .

==Non-standard scenarios==
In addition to the standard BBN scenario there are numerous non-standard BBN scenarios. These should not be confused with non-standard cosmology: a non-standard BBN scenario assumes that the Big Bang occurred, but inserts additional physics in order to see how this affects elemental abundances. These pieces of additional physics include relaxing or removing the assumption of homogeneity, or inserting new particles such as massive neutrinos.

There have been, and continue to be, various reasons for researching non-standard BBN. The first, which is largely of historical interest, is to resolve inconsistencies between BBN predictions and observations. This has proved to be of limited usefulness in that the inconsistencies were resolved by better observations, and in most cases trying to change BBN resulted in abundances that were more inconsistent with observations rather than less. The second reason for researching non-standard BBN, and largely the focus of non-standard BBN in the early 21st century, is to use BBN to place limits on unknown or speculative physics. For example, standard BBN assumes that no exotic hypothetical particles were involved in BBN. One can insert a hypothetical particle (such as a massive neutrino) and see what has to happen before BBN predicts abundances that are very different from observations. This has been done to put limits on the mass of a stable tau neutrino.

<doc id="44059" wikidata="Q81328" url="?curid=44059" title="Harrison Ford">
<text>Harrison Ford (born July 13, 1942) is an American actor. Regarded as a cinematic cultural icon, he has starred in several notable films over seven decades, and is one of the highest-grossing actors in the world. Ford&#x27;s accolades include nominations for an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award and five Golden Globe Awards, and his honors include the AFI Life Achievement Award, Cecil B. DeMille Award, Honorary César, and Honorary Palme d&#x27;Or.

After making his screen debut in 1966 and early supporting roles in the films &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974), Ford achieved global stardom for portraying Han Solo in the space opera film &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), which he reprised in four films for the eponymous franchise, which spanned over the next four decades. He also received recognition for his portrayal of the titular character in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise, beginning with &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), Rick Deckard in the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; franchise (19822017), and Jack Ryan in the action thriller films &quot;Patriot Games&quot; (1992) and &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (1994). These roles established him as an action hero and one of Hollywood&#x27;s most bankable stars.

Ford&#x27;s performance in the thriller film &quot;Witness&quot; (1985) earned him his sole Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. His other notable films include &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; (1986), &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988), &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; (1990), &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993), &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1995), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; (1997), &quot;Air Force One&quot; (1997), &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot; (1998), &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; (2000), &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot; (2002), &quot;Cowboys &amp; Aliens&quot; (2011), &quot;42&quot; (2013), &quot;The Age of Adaline&quot; (2015), and &quot;Captain America: Brave New World&quot; (2025). Ford has since starred in the Paramount+ western series &quot;1923&quot; (2022–present) and the Apple TV+ comedy series &quot;Shrinking&quot; (2023–present).

Outside of acting, Ford is a licensed pilot; he has often assisted the emergency services in rescue missions near his home in Wyoming, and he chaired an aviation education program for youth from 2004 to 2009. Ford is also an environmental activist, having served as the inaugural vice chair of Conservation International since 1991.

== Early life ==
Harrison Ford was born at the Swedish Covenant Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, on July 13, 1942, to former radio actress Dorothy (née Nidelman) and advertising executive and former actor John William &quot;Christopher&quot; Ford. 

His younger brother, Terence, was born in 1945. Their father was a Catholic of Irish descent, while their mother was an Ashkenazi Jew whose parents were emigrants from Minsk, Belarus, then in the Russian Empire. When asked in which religion he and his brother were raised, Ford jokingly responded &quot;Democrat&quot; and more seriously stated that they were raised to be &quot;liberals of every stripe&quot;. When asked about what influence his Jewish and Irish Catholic ancestry may have had on him, he quipped, &quot;As a man I&#x27;ve always felt Irish, as an actor I&#x27;ve always felt Jewish.&quot;

Ford was a Boy Scout, achieving the second-highest rank of Life Scout. He worked at Napowan Adventure Base Scout Camp as a counselor for the Reptile Study merit badge. Because of this, he and director Steven Spielberg later decided to depict the young Indiana Jones as a Life Scout in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989). Ford graduated in 1960 from Maine East High School in Park Ridge, Illinois. His voice was the first student voice broadcast on his high school&#x27;s new radio station, WMTH, and he was its first sportscaster during his senior year. He attended Ripon College in Ripon, Wisconsin, where he was a philosophy major and a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. A self-described &quot;late bloomer&quot;, Ford took a drama class in the final quarter of his senior year to get over his shyness and became fascinated with acting. Ford was expelled from college for plagiarism four days before graduation.

== Career ==

=== 1964–1976 ===
In 1964, after a season of summer stock with the Belfry Players in Wisconsin, Ford traveled to Los Angeles and eventually signed a contract with Columbia Pictures&#x27; new talent program. His first known role was an uncredited one as a bellhop in &quot;Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round&quot; (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking (or &quot;extra&quot;) roles in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokofsky. According to one anecdote, Tokofsky told Ford that when actor Tony Curtis delivered a bag of groceries, he could tell that Curtis was a movie star whereas Ford wasn&#x27;t; Ford immediately retorted that if Curtis was truly a talented actor, he would&#x27;ve delivered them like a bellhop. Ford was apparently fired soon after.

His speaking roles continued next with &quot;Luv&quot; (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as &quot;Harrison J. Ford&quot; in the 1967 Western film &quot;A Time for Killing&quot;, starring Glenn Ford, George Hamilton and Inger Stevens, but the &quot;J&quot; did not stand for anything since he has no middle name. It was added to avoid confusion with a silent film actor named Harrison Ford, who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932 and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier actor until he came upon a star with his own name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ford soon dropped the &quot;J&quot; and worked for Universal Studios, playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot; and &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. He appeared in the western &quot;Journey to Shiloh&quot; (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s 1970 film &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; as an arrested student protester. In 1968, he also worked as a camera operator for one of the Doors&#x27; tours. French filmmaker Jacques Demy chose Ford for the lead role of his first American film, &quot;Model Shop&quot; (1969), but the head of Columbia Pictures thought Ford had &quot;no future&quot; in the film business and told Demy to hire a more experienced actor. The part eventually went to Gary Lockwood. Ford later commented that the experience had been nevertheless a positive one because Demy was the first to show such faith in him.

Not happy with the roles offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his then-wife and two young sons. Clients at this time included the writers Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne, who lived on the beach at Malibu. Ford appears in the documentary &quot;Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold&quot;. He and his wife became friends of the writers. Casting director and fledgling producer Fred Roos championed the young Ford and secured him an audition with George Lucas for the role of Bob Falfa, which Ford went on to play in &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973). Ford&#x27;s relationship with Lucas profoundly affected his career later. After director Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s film &quot;The Godfather&quot; was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974) and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979); in the latter film, Ford played an army colonel named &quot;G. Lucas&quot;.

=== 1977–1997 ===
Ford&#x27;s work in &quot;American Graffiti&quot; eventually landed him his first starring film role, when Lucas hired him to read lines for actors auditioning for roles in Lucas&#x27;s upcoming epic space-opera film &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Lucas was eventually won over by Ford&#x27;s performance during these line reads and cast him as Han Solo. &quot;Star Wars&quot; became one of the most successful and groundbreaking films of all time, and brought Ford, and his co-stars Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, widespread recognition. Ford began to be cast in bigger roles in films throughout the late 1970s, including &quot;Heroes&quot; (1977), &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; (1978) and &quot;Hanover Street&quot; (1979). He also co-starred alongside Gene Wilder in the buddy-comedy western &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; (1979), playing a bank robber with a heart of gold. Ford returned to star in the successful &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequels &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), as well as the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; (1978). Ford wanted Lucas to kill off Han Solo at the end of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, saying, &quot;That would have given the whole film a bottom,&quot; but Lucas refused.
Ford&#x27;s status as a leading actor was solidified with &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), an action-adventure collaboration between Lucas and Steven Spielberg that gave Ford his second franchise role as the heroic, globe-trotting archaeologist Indiana Jones. Like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the film was massively successful; it became the highest-grossing film of the year. Spielberg was interested in casting Ford from the beginning, but Lucas was not, having already worked with him in &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Lucas relented after Tom Selleck was unable to accept. Ford went on to reprise the role throughout the rest of the decade in the prequel &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984), and the sequel &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989). During the June 1983 filming of &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; in London, Ford herniated a disc in his back. The 40-year-old actor was forced to fly back to Los Angeles for surgery and returned six weeks later.

Following his leading-man success as Indiana Jones, Ford played Rick Deckard in Ridley Scott&#x27;s dystopian science-fiction film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982). Compared to his experiences on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films, Ford had a difficult time with the production. He recalled to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;It was a long slog. I didn&#x27;t really find it that physically difficult—I thought it was mentally difficult.&quot; Ford and Scott also had differing views on the nature of his character, Deckard, that persist decades later. While not initially a success, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; became a cult classic and one of Ford&#x27;s most highly regarded films. Ford proved his versatility throughout the 1980s with dramatic parts in films such as &quot;Witness&quot; (1985), &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; (1986), and &quot;Frantic&quot; (1988), as well as the romantic male lead opposite Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver in the comedy-drama &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988). &quot;Witness&quot; and &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; allowed Ford to explore his potential as a dramatic actor, and both performances were widely acclaimed. Ford later recalled that working with director Peter Weir on &quot;Witness&quot; and &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; were two of the best experiences of his career.

In late 1991, Ford was slated to portray company lawyer A. Philip Randolph in an action-historical film entitled &quot;Night Ride Down&quot;, which would have been set around a labor union strike in the 1930s. Paramount Pictures shelved the project, after Ford quit the film over script changes he disagreed with. In the years that followed, Ford became the second actor to portray Jack Ryan in two films of the film series based on the literary character created by Tom Clancy: &quot;Patriot Games&quot; (1992) and &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (1994), both co-starring Anne Archer and James Earl Jones. Ford took over the role from Alec Baldwin, who had played Ryan in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990). This led to long-lasting resentment from Baldwin, who said that he had wanted to reprise the role but Ford had negotiated with Paramount behind his back. Ford played leading roles in other action-based thrillers throughout the decade, such as &quot;The Fugitive &quot;(1993), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; (1997), and &quot;Air Force One&quot; (1997). For his performance in &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, which co-starred Tommy Lee Jones, Ford received some of the best reviews of his career, including from Roger Ebert, who concluded that, &quot;Ford is once again the great modern movie everyman. As an actor, nothing he does seems merely for show, and in the face of this melodramatic material he deliberately plays down, lays low, gets on with business instead of trying to exploit the drama in meaningless acting flourishes.&quot;

Ford played more straight dramatic roles in &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; (1990) and &quot;Regarding Henry&quot; (1991), and another romantic lead role in &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1995), a remake of the classic 1954 film of the same name. Ford established working relationships with many well-regarded directors during this time, including Weir, Alan J. Pakula, Mike Nichols, Phillip Noyce, and Sydney Pollack, collaborating twice with each of them. This was the most lucrative period of Ford&#x27;s career. From 1977 to 1997, he appeared in 14 films that reached the top 15 in the yearly domestic box-office rankings, 12 of which reached the top ten. Six of the films he appeared in during this time were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, among other awards: &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;Witness&quot;, &quot;Working Girl&quot;, and &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.

=== 1998–2014 ===
In the late 1990s, Ford started appearing in several critically derided and commercially disappointing films that failed to match his earlier successes, including &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot; (1998), &quot;Random Hearts&quot; (1999), &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot; (2002), &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot; (2003), &quot;Firewall&quot; (2006) and &quot;Extraordinary Measures&quot; (2010). One exception was &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; (2000), which grossed over $155million in the United States and $291million worldwide. Ford served as an executive producer on &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot; and &quot;Extraordinary Measures&quot;, both of which were based on true events.

In 2004, Ford declined a chance to star in the thriller &quot;Syriana&quot;, later commenting that &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel strongly enough about the truth of the material and I think I made a mistake.&quot; The role went to George Clooney, who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his work. Before that, Ford had passed on a role in another Stephen Gaghan-written film, that of Robert Wakefield in &quot;Traffic&quot;, which went to Michael Douglas.
In 2008, Ford enjoyed success with the release of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, the first Indiana Jones film in 19 years and another collaboration with Lucas and Spielberg. The film received generally positive reviews and was the second-highest-grossing film worldwide in 2008. Ford later said he would like to star in another sequel &quot;if it didn&#x27;t take another 20 years to digest.&quot;

Other 2008 work included &quot;Crossing Over&quot;, directed by Wayne Kramer. In the film, Ford plays an ICE/Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent, working alongside Ashley Judd and Ray Liotta. He also narrated a feature documentary film about the Dalai Lama, &quot;Dalai Lama Renaissance&quot;. Ford filmed the medical drama &quot;Extraordinary Measures&quot; in 2009 in Portland, Oregon. Released on January 22, 2010, the film also starred Brendan Fraser and Alan Ruck. Also in 2010, he co-starred in the film &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, along with Rachel McAdams, Diane Keaton and Patrick Wilson. Although the film was a disappointment at the box office, Ford&#x27;s performance was well received by critics, some of whom thought it was his best role in years. In July 2011, Ford starred alongside Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde in the science-fiction/western hybrid film &quot;Cowboys &amp; Aliens&quot;. To promote the film, he appeared at San Diego Comic-Con and, apparently surprised by the warm welcome, told the audience, &quot;I just wanted to make a living as an actor. I didn&#x27;t know about this.&quot; Also in 2011, Ford starred in Japanese commercials advertising the video game &quot;Uncharted 3: Drake&#x27;s Deception&quot; for the PlayStation 3.

2013 began a trend that saw Ford accepting more diverse supporting roles. That year, he co-starred in the corporate espionage thriller &quot;Paranoia&quot; with Liam Hemsworth and Gary Oldman, whom he had previously worked with in &quot;Air Force One&quot;, and also appeared in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, &quot;42&quot; and &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot;. His performance as Branch Rickey in the film &quot;42&quot; was praised by many critics and garnered Ford a nomination as best supporting actor for the Satellite Awards.
Initially, Brian Helgeland was hesitant to cast Ford, seeking a character actor for the role of Rickey. However, Ford&#x27;s persistence and dedication to the role, including studying Rickey&#x27;s life and adopting significant physical transformations, won Helgeland over. Ford&#x27;s commitment to embodying Rickey involved wearing a fat suit, prosthetics, and mastering Rickey&#x27;s distinctive voice and mannerisms. He researched Rickey&#x27;s life, listened to recordings from the Baseball Hall of Fame, and worked with a voice coach to capture Rickey&#x27;s distinct speech. &quot;I loved the language of the guy, I loved his style,&quot; Ford noted. In a 2023 interview with James Hibberd of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Ford said Branch Rickey is one of his roles he is most proud of.

In 2014, he appeared in &quot;The Expendables 3&quot;, and the following year, co-starred with Blake Lively in the romantic drama &quot;The Age of Adaline&quot; to positive reviews.

=== 2015–present ===

Ford reprised the role of Han Solo in the long-awaited Star Wars sequel &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), which was highly successful, like its predecessors. During filming on June 11, 2014, Ford suffered what was said to be a fractured ankle when a hydraulic door fell on him. He was airlifted to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, for treatment. Ford&#x27;s son Ben released details on his father&#x27;s injury, saying that his ankle would likely need a plate and screws, and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered. Ford made his return to filming in mid-August, after a two-month layoff as he recovered from his injury. Ford&#x27;s character was killed off in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, but it was subsequently announced, via a casting call, that Ford would return in some capacity as Solo in &quot;Episode VIII&quot;. In February 2016, when the cast for &quot;Episode VIII&quot; was confirmed, it was indicated that Ford would not reprise his role in the film after all. When Ford was asked whether Solo could come back in &quot;some form&quot;, he replied, &quot;Anything is possible in space.&quot; He eventually made an uncredited appearance as a vision in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019).

On February 26, 2015, Alcon Entertainment announced Ford would reprise his role as Rick Deckard in Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s science fiction sequel film &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;. The film, and Ford&#x27;s performance, was very well received by critics upon its release in October 2017. Scott Collura of IGN called it a &quot;deep, rich, smart film that&#x27;s visually awesome and full of great sci-fi concepts&quot; and Ford&#x27;s role &quot;a quiet, sort of gut-wrenching interpretation to Deckard and what he must&#x27;ve gone through in the past three decades.&quot; The film grossed $259.3million worldwide, short of the estimated $400million that it needed to break even. In 2019, Ford had his first voice role in an animated film, as a dog named Rooster in &quot;The Secret Life of Pets 2&quot;. With filming of a fifth &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film delayed by a year, Ford headlined a big-budget adaptation of Jack London&#x27;s &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, playing prospector John Thornton. The film was released in February 2020 to a mixed critical reception and its theatrical release was shortened due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry.

In 2022, Ford was cast to star alongside Helen Mirren in the Paramount+ western drama series &quot;1923&quot;. The two had previously starred together 36 years earlier in &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot;. The series premiered in December 2022 to positive reviews, and it is set to run for a total of two seasons. That same year, it was announced that Ford would star in the Apple TV+ comedy drama series &quot;Shrinking&quot;. The series premiered in January 2023 to positive reviews, with Ford receiving praise for his performance. In a 2023 interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, it was revealed that he accepted the roles in both &quot;1923&quot; and &quot;Shrinking&quot; despite there not being a script at the time.

Ford reprised the role of Indiana Jones in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot; (2023), which he stated was his last appearance as the character. The film received generally positive reviews, with many critics highlighting Ford&#x27;s performance. In February 2025, Ford appeared as Thaddeus &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross in the film &quot;Captain America: Brave New World&quot;, and will reprise the role in &quot;Thunderbolts*&quot;, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, replacing William Hurt, who played the character in previous MCU films from 2008 to 2021 before his death.

Ford has become outspoken against the industry use of artificial intelligence that can put human actors out of work. In February 2025 he brought attention to an ongoing strike by video game actors when he voiced support for a voice actor playing the role of Indiana Jones in the video game &quot;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.&quot; 

== Personal life ==

Ford has been married three times and has four biological children and one adopted child. He was first married to Mary Marquardt from 1964 until their divorce in 1979. They had two sons, born in 1966 and 1969. The older son co-owns Ford&#x27;s Filling Station, a gastropub located at Terminal 5 in Los Angeles International Airport. The younger son is owner of the Ludwig Clothing company and previously owned Strong Sports Gym and the Kim Sing Theater.

Ford&#x27;s second marriage was to screenwriter Melissa Mathison from March 1983 until their separation in 2000; they divorced in 2004. They had a son, born in 1987, and a daughter, born in 1990. Mathison died in 2015. 

Ford began dating actress Calista Flockhart after they met at the 2002 Golden Globe Awards. He proposed to Flockhart over Valentine&#x27;s Day weekend in 2009. They married on June 15, 2010, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where Ford was filming &quot;Cowboys &amp; Aliens&quot;. They are the parents of a son, born in 2001, whom Flockhart had adopted before meeting Ford. Ford and Flockhart live on an ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, where he has lived since the 1980s and approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. They retain a base in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Ford is one of Hollywood&#x27;s most private actors, guarding much of his personal life. 

Ford commented on his parenting choices in 2023: &quot;I can tell you this: If I’d been less successful, I’d probably be a better parent.&quot;

In her 2016 autobiography &quot;The Princess Diarist&quot;, his co-star Carrie Fisher wrote that she and Ford had a three-month affair in 1976 during the filming of &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

== Aviation ==

Ford is a licensed pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. On several occasions, he has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities in Wyoming, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration.

Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour (), he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro Airport in Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft in which he made his first solo flight.
Ford&#x27;s aircraft are kept at Santa Monica Airport. The Bell 407 helicopter is often kept and flown in Jackson and has been used by Ford in two mountain rescues during his assigned duty time with Teton County Search and Rescue. During one of the rescues, Ford recovered a hiker who had become lost and disoriented. She boarded his helicopter and promptly vomited into one of the rescuers&#x27; caps, unaware of who the pilot was until much later; &quot;I can&#x27;t believe I barfed in Harrison Ford&#x27;s helicopter!&quot; she said later.

Ford flies his de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver (N28S) more than any of his other aircraft, and has repeatedly said that he likes this aircraft and the sound of its Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985 radial engine. According to Ford, it had been flown in the CIA&#x27;s Air America operations and was riddled with bullet holes that had to be patched up.

In March 2004, Ford officially became chairman of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA)&#x27;s Young Eagles program, founded by then-EAA president Tom Poberezny and fellow actor-pilot Cliff Robertson. Ford was asked to take the position by Greg Anderson, Senior Vice President of the EAA at the time, to replace General Chuck Yeager, who was vacating the post that he had held for many years. Ford at first was hesitant, but later accepted the offer and has made appearances with the Young Eagles at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh gathering at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, for two years. In July 2005, at the gathering in Oshkosh, Ford agreed to accept the position for another two years. He has flown over 280 children as part of the Young Eagles program, usually in his DHC-2 Beaver, which can seat the actor and five children. Ford stepped down as program chairman in 2009 and was replaced by Captain Chesley Sullenberger and First Officer Jeff Skiles. He is involved with the EAA chapter in Driggs, Idaho, just over the Teton Range from Jackson, Wyoming. On July 28, 2016, Ford flew the two millionth Young Eagle at the EAA AirVenture convention, making it the most successful aviation-youth introduction program in history.

As of 2009, Ford appears in Internet advertisements for General Aviation Serves America, a campaign by the advocacy group Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA). He has also appeared in several independent aviation documentaries, including &quot;Wings Over the Rockies&quot; (2009), &quot;Flying the Feathered Edge: The Bob Hoover Project&quot; (2014), and &quot;Living in the Age of Airplanes&quot; (2015).

Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope, and is known for having made several trips to Washington, D.C., to fight for pilots&#x27; rights. He has also donated substantial funds to aerobatic champion Sean Tucker&#x27;s charitable program, The Bob Hoover Academy (named after legendary aviator Bob Hoover), which educates at-risk teens in central California and teaches them how to fly.
=== Incidents ===
On August 22, 1987, Ford was traveling as a passenger with Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke aboard a Gulfstream III when the jet developed an engine fire and stuck landing gear during a Paris-to-L.A. flight and was forced to land in Bangor, Maine. The charter company owning the G-3 sent another jet and mechanics to Bangor, and the group flew out on that plane the next day.

On October 23, 1999, Ford was involved in the crash of a Bell 206L4 LongRanger helicopter. The NTSB accident report states that Ford was piloting the aircraft over the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita, California, on a routine training flight. While making his second attempt at an autorotation with powered recovery, the aircraft was unable to recover power after the sudden drop in altitude. It landed hard and began skidding forward in the loose gravel before flipping onto its side. Neither Ford nor the instructor pilot suffered any injuries, though the helicopter was seriously damaged.

On March 5, 2015, Ford&#x27;s plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California after it lost engine power. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition. Ford suffered a broken pelvis and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries.

On February 13, 2017, Ford landed an Aviat Husky at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, on the taxiway left of runway 20L. A Boeing 737 was holding short of the runway on the taxiway when Ford overflew them.

On April 24, 2020, at the Los Angeles Hawthorne Airport while piloting his Husky, Ford crossed a runway where another aircraft was landing. According to the FAA, the two planes were about 3,600 feet from each other and there was no danger of a crash. A representative of Ford later said that he &quot;misheard&quot; an instruction given to him by air traffic control.

== Activism ==
=== Environmental work ===
Ford is vice-chair of Conservation International, an American nonprofit environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. The organization&#x27;s intent is to protect nature. Since 1992, Ford has lent his voice to a series of public service messages promoting environmental involvement for EarthShare, an American federation of environmental and conservation charities. He has acted as a spokesperson for Restore Hetch Hetchy, a non-profit organization dedicated to restoring Yosemite National Park&#x27;s Hetch Hetchy Valley to its original condition. Ford also appears in the documentary series &quot;Years of Living Dangerously&quot;, which reports on people affected by and seeking solutions to climate change.

In 1993, the arachnologist Norman Platnick named a new species of spider &quot;Calponia harrisonfordi&quot;, and in 2002 the entomologist Edward O. Wilson named a new ant species &quot;Pheidole harrisonfordi&quot; (in recognition of Harrison&#x27;s work as Vice Chairman of Conservation International). The Peruvian snake species &quot;Tachymenoides harrisonfordi&quot; was named for Ford in 2023.

In September 2013, Ford, while filming an environmental documentary in Indonesia, interviewed the Indonesian Forestry Minister, Zulkifli Hasan. After the interview, Ford and his crew were accused of &quot;harassing state institutions&quot; and publicly threatened with deportation. Questions within the interview concerned the Tesso Nilo National Park, Sumatra. It was alleged the Minister of Forestry was given no prior warning of questions nor the chance to explain the challenges of catching illegal loggers. Ford was provided an audience with the Indonesian President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, during which he expressed concerns regarding Indonesia&#x27;s environmental degradation and the government efforts to address climate change. In response, the President explained Indonesia&#x27;s commitment to preserving its oceans and forests.

In 2019, on behalf of Conservation International, Ford gave an impassioned speech during the United Nations&#x27; Climate Action Summit in New York on the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and its effect on climate change for the rest of the world. Ford urged his audience to listen to &#x27;angry young people&#x27; trying to make a difference in the situation, emphasizing, &quot;The most important thing we can do for them is to get the hell out of their way.&quot;

=== Political views ===
Like his parents, Ford is a lifelong Democrat. 

On September 7, 1995, Ford testified before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in support of the Dalai Lama and an independent Tibet. In 2007, he narrated the documentary &quot;Dalai Lama Renaissance&quot;. 

In 2000, Ford donated $1000 to the presidential campaigns of Bill Bradley, Al Gore, and John McCain. 

In 2003, he publicly condemned the Iraq War and called for &quot;regime change&quot; in the United States. He also criticized Hollywood for making movies which were &quot;more akin to video games than stories about human life and relationships&quot;, and he called for more gun control in the United States. 

In 2009, Ford signed a petition calling for the release of film director Roman Polanski, who had been arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

After Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said his favorite role of Ford&#x27;s was &quot;Air Force One&quot; because he &quot;stood up for America&quot;, Ford responded that it was just a film and made critical statements against Trump&#x27;s presidential bid. 

Ford endorsed Joe Biden&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign against Trump. He said that he wanted to &quot;encourage people to support candidates that will support the environment&quot; and felt that under Trump, the U.S. had &quot;lost some of our credibility in the world&quot;. Along with Mark Hamill, Ford worked with the anti-Trump Republican group The Lincoln Project to produce and narrate a 2020 election ad attacking Trump&#x27;s disparaging of Anthony Fauci. 

On November 2, 2024, he endorsed Kamala Harris&#x27;s 2024 presidential campaign.

=== Archaeology ===
Following on his success portraying the archaeologist Indiana Jones, Ford also plays a part in supporting the work of professional archaeologists. He serves as a General Trustee on the Governing Board of the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA), North America&#x27;s oldest and largest organization devoted to the world of archaeology. Ford assists them in their mission of increasing public awareness of archaeology and preventing looting and the illegal antiquities trade.

== Awards and nominations ==
Throughout his career, Ford has received significant recognition for his work in the entertainment industry. In 1986, he was nominated for Best Actor at the 58th Academy Awards for his performance in &quot;Witness&quot;, a role for which he also received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations in the same category. Three additional Golden Globe nominations went to Ford in 1987, 1994 and 1996 for his performances in &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Sabrina&quot;. In 2000, he was the recipient of the AFI Life Achievement Award from the American Film Institute for his body of work, presented to him by two of his closest collaborators and fellow industry giants, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. In 2002, he was given the Cecil B. DeMille Award, another career achievement honor, from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association at the 59th Golden Globe Awards ceremony. On May 30, 2003, Ford received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In 2006, he received the Jules Verne Award, given to an actor who has &quot;encouraged the spirit of adventure and imagination&quot; throughout their career. He was presented with the first-ever Hero Award at the 2007 Scream Awards for his many iconic roles, including Indiana Jones and Han Solo (both of which earned him a collective three Saturn Awards for Best Actor in 1982, 2024 and 2016, respectively), and in 2008 he received the Spike TV&#x27;s Guy&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;Brass Balls&quot;. In 2015, Ford received the Albert R. Broccoli Britannia Award for Worldwide Contribution to Entertainment from BAFTA Los Angeles. In 2018, Ford was honored by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation with the Artists Inspiration Award for both his acting and philanthropic work alongside fellow honoree Lady Gaga. SAG-AFTRA Foundation Board President JoBeth Williams in the press release said, &quot;Harrison Ford is an acting legend in every known galaxy, but what many do not know are the decades of philanthropic service and leadership he has given to Conservation International to help protect our planet.&quot;

Other prestigious film honors for Ford include an Honorary Cesar, an Honorary Palme d&#x27;Or from the Cannes Film Festival, the Career Achievement Award from the Hollywood Film Awards, the Kirk Douglas Award for Excellence in Film from the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, the Box Office Star of the Century Award from the National Association of Theatre Owners and the Lifetime Achievement Award from both the Locarno Film Festival and the Zurich Film Festival.

Ford has also been honored multiple times for his involvement in general aviation, receiving the Living Legends of Aviation Award and the Experimental Aircraft Association&#x27;s Freedom of Flight Award in 2009, the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy in 2010, and the Al Ueltschi Humanitarian Award in 2013. &quot;Flying&quot; magazine ranked him number 48 on their 2013 list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation. In 2024, Ford was a recipient of the Disney Legends Award for his outstanding film contributions to The Walt Disney Company.

<text>The Barents Sea ( , ; , ; ) is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean, located off the northern coasts of Norway and Russia and divided between Norwegian and Russian territorial waters. It was known earlier among Russians as the Northern Sea, Pomorsky Sea or Murman Sea (&quot;Norse Sea&quot;); the current name of the sea is after the historical Dutch navigator Willem Barentsz.

The Barents Sea is a rather shallow shelf sea with an average depth of , and it is an important site for both fishing and hydrocarbon exploration. It is bordered by the Kola Peninsula to the south, the shelf edge towards the Norwegian Sea to the west, the archipelagos of Svalbard to the northwest, Franz Josef Land to the northeast and Novaya Zemlya to the east. The islands of Novaya Zemlya, an extension of the northern end of the Ural Mountains, separate the Barents Sea from the Kara Sea.

Although part of the Arctic Ocean, the Barents Sea has been characterised as &quot;turning into the Atlantic&quot; or in the process of being &quot;Atlantified&quot; because of its status as &quot;the Arctic warming hot spot.&quot; Hydrologic changes due to global warming have led to a reduction in sea ice and in the stratification of the water column, which could produce major changes in weather in Eurasia. One prediction is that, as the Barents Sea&#x27;s permanent ice-free area grows, evaporation will increase, leading to increased winter snowfalls in much of continental Europe.

==Geography==

The southern half of the Barents Sea, including the ports of Murmansk (Russia) and Vardø (Norway) remain ice-free year-round due to the warm North Atlantic drift. In September, the entire Barents Sea is more or less completely ice-free. From 1920 to 1944, Finland&#x27;s territory also reached the Barents Sea. The Liinakhamari harbour in the Pechengsky District was Finland&#x27;s only ice-free winter harbour until 1944 when it was ceded to the Soviet Union.

There are three main types of water masses in the Barents Sea: Warm, salty Atlantic water (temperature &gt;3 °C, salinity &gt;35) from the North Atlantic drift; cold Arctic water (temperature &lt;0 °C, salinity &lt;35) from the north; and warm, but not very salty, coastal water (temperature &gt;3 °C, salinity &lt;34.7). Between the Atlantic and Polar waters, a front called the Polar Front is formed. In the western parts of the sea (close to Bear Island), this front is determined by the bottom topography and is therefore relatively sharp and stable from year to year, while in the east (towards Novaya Zemlya), it can be quite diffuse and its position can vary markedly between years.

The lands of Novaya Zemlya attained most of their early Holocene coastal deglaciation approximately 10,000 years before the present.

===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the &quot;Barentsz Sea&quot; as follows:

:&quot;On the west&quot;: The northeastern limit of the Norwegian Sea [A line joining the southernmost point of West Spitzbergen to North Cape of Bear Island, through this island to Cape Bull and thence on to North Cape in Norway (25°45&#x27;E)].

:&quot;On the northwest&quot;: The eastern shore of West Spitzbergen , Hinlopen Strait up to 80° latitude north; south and east coasts of North-East Land [the island of Nordaustlandet] to Cape Leigh Smith ().

:&quot;On the north&quot;: Cape Leigh Smith across the Islands Bolshoy Ostrov (Great Island) [Storøya], Gilles [Kvitøya] and Victoria; Cape Mary Harmsworth (southwestern extremity of Alexandra Land) along the northern coasts of Franz-Josef Land as far as Cape Kohlsaat ().

:&quot;On the east&quot;: Cape Kohlsaat to Cape Zhelaniya (Desire); west and southwest coast of Novaya Zemlya to Cape Kussov Noss and thence to western entrance Cape, Dolgaya Bay () on Vaigach Island. Through Vaigach Island to Cape Greben; thence to Cape Belyi Noss on the mainland.

:&quot;On the south&quot;: The northern limit of the White Sea [A line joining Svyatoi Nos (Murmansk Coast, 39°47&#x27;E) and Cape Kanin].

Other islands in the Barents Sea include Chaichy and Timanets.

===Geology===

The Barents Sea was originally formed from two major continental collisions: the Caledonian orogeny, in which the Baltica and Laurentia collided to form Laurasia, and a subsequent collision between Laurasia and Western Siberia. Most of its geological history is dominated by extensional tectonics, caused by the collapse of the Caledonian and Uralian orogenic belts and the break-up of Pangaea. These events created the major rift basins that dominate the Barents Shelf, along with various platforms and structural highs. The later geological history of the Barents Sea is dominated by Late Cenozoic uplift, particularly that caused by Quaternary glaciation, which has resulted in erosion and deposition of significant sediment.

===Ecology===

Due to the North Atlantic drift, the Barents Sea has a high biological production compared to other oceans of similar latitude. The spring bloom of phytoplankton can start quite early near the ice edge because the fresh water from the melting ice makes up a stable water layer on top of the seawater. The phytoplankton bloom feeds zooplankton such as &quot;Calanus finmarchicus&quot;, &quot;Calanus glacialis&quot;, &quot;Calanus hyperboreus&quot;, &quot;Oithona&quot; spp., and krill. The zooplankton feeders include young cod, capelin, polar cod, whales, and little auk. The capelin is a key food for top predators such as the north-east Arctic cod, harp seals, and seabirds such as the common guillemot and Brunnich&#x27;s guillemot. The fisheries of the Barents Sea, in particular the cod fisheries, are of great importance for both Norway and Russia.

SIZEX-89 was an international winter experiment in 1989 for which the main objectives were to perform sensor signature studies of different ice types to develop SAR algorithms for ice variables, such as ice types, ice concentrations and ice kinematics. Although previous research suggested that predation by whales may be the cause of depleting fish stocks, more recent research suggests that marine mammal consumption has only a trivial influence on fisheries. A model assessing the effects of fisheries and climate was far more accurate at describing trends in fish abundance. There is a genetically distinct polar bear population associated with the Barents Sea.

===Pollution===
The Barents Sea is &quot;among the most polluted places on Earth&quot; due to accumulated marine garbage, decades of Soviet nuclear tests, radioactive waste dumping and industrial pollution. The elevated pollution has caused elevated rates of disease among locals. With rising military buildup and increased use of shipping lanes heading east through the Arctic, there are concerns that a further increase in pollution is likely, not least from the increased risk of future oil spills from ships not properly equipped for the environment.

===Connections to global weather===
==History==
===Name===
The Barents Sea was formerly known to Russians as Murmanskoye More, or the &quot;Sea of Murmans&quot; (i.e., their term for Norwegians). It appears with this name in sixteenth-century maps, including Gerard Mercator&#x27;s &quot;Map of the Arctic&quot; published in his 1595 atlas. Its eastern corner, in the region of the Pechora River&#x27;s estuary, has been known as Pechorskoye Morye, that is, Pechora Sea. It was also known as Pomorsky Morye, after the first inhabitants of its shores, the Pomors.

This sea was given its present name by Europeans in honour of Willem Barentsz, a Dutch navigator and explorer. Barentsz was the leader of early expeditions to the far north, at the end of the sixteenth century.

The Barents Sea has been called by sailors &quot;&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dance Floor&quot; due to its unpredictability and difficulty level.

Ocean rowers call it &quot;Devil&#x27;s Jaw&quot;&quot;. In 2017, after the first recorded complete man-powered crossing of the Barents Sea from Tromsø to Longyearbyen in a rowboat by the Polar Row expedition, captain Fiann Paul was asked by Norwegian TV2 how a rower would name the Barents Sea. Fiann responded that he would name it &quot;Devil&#x27;s Jaw&quot;, adding that the winds you constantly battle are like breath from the devil&#x27;s nostrils while he holds you in his jaws.

===Modern era===
Seabed mapping was completed in 1933; the first full map was produced by Russian marine geologist Maria Klenova.

The Barents Sea was the site of a notable World War II engagement which later became known as the Battle of the Barents Sea. Under the command of Oskar Kummetz, German warships sank minelayer HMS &quot;Bramble&quot; and destroyer but lost destroyer . Also, the German cruiser was severely damaged by British gunfire. The Germans later retreated and the British convoy arrived safely at Murmansk shortly afterwards.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet used the southern reaches of the sea as a ballistic missile submarine bastion, a strategy that Russia continued. Nuclear contamination from dumped Russian naval reactors is an environmental concern in the Barents Sea.

==Economy==

===Political status===
For decades there was a boundary dispute between Norway and Russia regarding the position of the boundary between their respective claims to the Barents Sea. The Norwegians favoured a median line, based on the Geneva Convention of 1958, whereas the Russians favoured a meridian- based sector line, based on a Soviet decision of 1926. A neutral &quot;grey&quot; zone between the competing claims had an area of , which is approximately 12% of the total area of the Barents Sea. The two countries started negotiations on the location of the boundary in 1974 and agreed to a moratorium on hydrocarbon exploration in 1976.

Twenty years after the fall of the Soviet Union, in 2010 Norway and Russia signed an agreement that placed the boundary equidistant from their competing claims. This was ratified and went into force on 7 July 2011, opening the grey zone for hydrocarbon exploration.

===Oil and gas===
Encouraged by the success of oil exploration and production in the North Sea in the 1960s, Norway began hydrocarbon exploration in the Barents Sea in 1969. They acquired seismic reflection surveys through the following years, which were analysed to understand the location of the main sedimentary basins. NorskHydro drilled the first well in 1980, which was a dry hole, and the first discoveries were made the following year: the Alke and Askeladden gas fields. Several more discoveries were made on the Norwegian side of the Barents Sea throughout the 1980s, including the important Snøhvit field.

However, interest in the area began to wane due to a succession of dry holes, wells containing only gas (which was cheap at the time), and the prohibitive costs of developing wells in such a remote area. Interest in the area was reignited in the late 2000s after the Snovhit field was finally brought into production and two new large discoveries were made.

The Russians began exploration in their territory around the same time, encouraged by their success in the Timan-Pechora Basin. They drilled their first wells in the early 1980s, and some very large gas fields were discovered throughout this decade. The Shtokman field was discovered in 1988 and is classed as a giant gas field: currently the 5th-largest gas field in the world. Similar practical difficulties Barents Sea resulted in a decline in Russian exploration, aggravated by the nation&#x27;s political instability of the 1990s.

===Fishing===

The Barents Sea contains the world&#x27;s largest remaining cod population, as well as important stocks of haddock and capelin. Fishing is managed jointly by Russia and Norway in the form of the Joint Norwegian–Russian Fisheries Commission, established in 1976, in an attempt to keep track of how many fish are leaving the ecosystem due to fishing. The Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries Commission sets Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for multiple species throughout their migratory tracks. Through the Commission, Norway and Russia also exchange fishing quotas and catch statistics to ensure the TACs are not being violated.

However there are problems with reporting under this system, and researchers believe that they do not have accurate data for the effects of fishing on the Barents Sea ecosystem. Cod is one of the major catches. A large portion of catches are not reported when the fishing boats land, to account for profits that are being lost to high taxes and fees. Since many fishermen do not strictly follow the TACs and rules set forth by the Commission, the amount of fish being extracted annually from the Barents Sea is underestimated.

===Barents Sea biodiversity and marine bioprospecting===

The Barents Sea, where temperate waters from the Gulf Stream and cold waters from the Arctic meet, is home to an enormous diversity of organisms, which are well-adapted to the extreme conditions of their marine habitats. This makes these arctic species very attractive for marine bioprospecting. Marine bioprospecting may be defined as the search for bioactive molecules and compounds from marine sources that have new, unique properties and the potential for commercial applications. Amongst others, applications include medicines, food and feed, textiles, cosmetics and the process industry.

The Norwegian government strategically supports the development of marine bioprospecting as it has the potential to contribute to new and sustainable wealth creation. Tromsø and the northern areas of Norway play a central role in this strategy. They have excellent access to unique Arctic marine organisms, existing marine industries, and R&amp;D competence and infrastructure in this region. Since 2007, science and industry have cooperated closely on bioprospecting and the development and commercialization of new products.

<doc id="44061" wikidata="Q852376" url="?curid=44061" title="Convulsion">
<text>A convulsion is a medical condition where the body muscles contract and relax rapidly and repeatedly, resulting in uncontrolled shaking. Because epileptic seizures typically include convulsions, the term &quot;convulsion&quot; is often used as a synonym for &quot;seizure&quot;. However, not all epileptic seizures result in convulsions, and not all convulsions are caused by epileptic seizures. Non-epileptic convulsions have no relation with epilepsy, and are caused by non-epileptic seizures.

Convulsions can be caused by epilepsy, infections (including a severe form of listeriosis which is caused by eating food contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes), brain trauma, or other medical conditions. They can also occur from an electric shock or improperly enriched air for scuba diving.

The word &quot;fit&quot; is sometimes used to mean a convulsion or epileptic seizure.

==Signs and symptoms==
A person having a convulsion may experience several different symptoms, such as a brief blackout, confusion, drooling, loss of bowel or bladder control, sudden shaking of the entire body, uncontrollable muscle spasms, or temporary cessation of breathing. Symptoms usually last from a few seconds to several minutes, although they can last longer.

Convulsions in children are not necessarily benign, and may lead to brain damage if prolonged. In these patients, the frequency of occurrence should not downplay their significance, as a worsening seizure state may reflect the damage caused by successive attacks. Symptoms may include:
* Lack of awareness
* Loss of consciousness
* Eyes rolling back
* Changes to breathing
* Stiffening of the arms, legs, or whole body
* Jerky movements of the arms, legs, body, or head
* Lack of control over movements
* Inability to respond

==Causes==
Most convulsions are the result of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Often, a specific cause is not clear. Numerous conditions can cause a convulsion.

Convulsions can be caused by specific chemicals in the blood, as well as infections like meningitis or encephalitis. Other possibilities include celiac disease, head trauma, stroke, or lack of oxygen to the brain. Sometimes the convulsion can be caused by genetic defects or brain tumors. Convulsions can also occur when the blood sugar is too low or there is a deficiency of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). The pathophysiology of convulsion remains ambiguous.

Convulsions are often caused by epileptic seizures, febrile seizures, non-epileptic seizures, or paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia. In rare cases, it may be triggered by reactions to certain medications, such as antidepressants, stimulants, and antihistamines.

===Epileptic seizures===
Epilepsy is a neuronal disorder with multifactorial manifestations. It is a noncontagious illness and is usually associated with sudden attacks of seizures, which are an immediate and initial anomaly in the electrical activity of the brain that disrupts part or all of the body. Various areas of the brain can be disturbed by epileptic events. Epileptic seizures can have contrary clinical features. Epileptic seizures can have long-lasting effects on cerebral blood flow.

Various kinds of epileptic seizures affect 60 million people worldwide.

===Generalized seizures===
The most common type of seizure is called a generalized seizure, also known as a generalized convulsion. This is characterized by a loss of consciousness which may lead to the person collapsing. The body stiffens for about a minute and then jerks uncontrollably for the next minute. During this, the patient may fall and injure themselves or bite their tongue, may lose control of their bladder, and their eyes may roll back. A familial history of seizures puts a person at a greater risk of developing them. Generalized seizures have been broadly classified into two categories: motor and non-motor.
A generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS), also known as a grand mal seizure, is a whole-body seizure that has a tonic phase followed by clonic muscle retrenchments. GTCSs can happen in people of all ages. GTCSs are very hazardous, and they increase the risk of injuries and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is a sudden, unexpected, nontraumatic death in patients with epilepsy. Strong convulsions that are related to GTCSs can also cause falls and severe injuries.

Not all generalized seizures produce convulsions. For example, in an absence seizure, also known as a petit mal seizure, the brain experiences electrical disturbances but the body remains motionless and unresponsive.

===Febrile convulsion===
A common cause of convulsions in children is febrile seizures, a type of seizure associated with a high body temperature. This high temperature is a usual immune response to infection, and in febrile convulsions, the reason for the fever is extra-cranial (such as a body-wide viral infection). In Nigeria, malaria—which can cause sudden, high fevers—is a significant cause of convulsions among children under 5 years of age.

Febrile seizures fall into two categories: simple and complex. A simple febrile seizure is generalized, occurs singularly, and lasts less than 15 minutes. A complex febrile seizure can be focused in an area of the body, occur more than once, and lasts for more than 15 minutes. Febrile seizures affect 2–4% of children in the United States and Western Europe. It is the most common childhood seizure. The exact reason for febrile convulsion is unidentified, though it might be the outcome of the interchange between environmental and genetic factors.

===Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures===
Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are described as neurobehavioral conditions or &quot;psychogenic illnesses&quot; which occur not due to the electrical disturbances in a person&#x27;s brain but due to mental and emotional stress. PNES are an important differential diagnosis and a common occurrence in epilepsy centers. According to the &quot;5th Edison of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM 5), PNES is classified as a &quot;conversion disorder&quot; or Functional Neurologic Symptom Disorder characterized by alterations in behavior, motor activity, consciousness, and sensation. A few neuroimaging (functional and structural) studies suggest that PNES may replicate sensorimotor alterations, emotional regulation, cognitive control, and integration of neural circuits.

===Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia===
There is a linkage between infantile convulsion and paroxysmal dyskinesia. Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is characterized by sudden involuntary movement caused by sudden stress or excitement. The relationship between convulsion and PKD is mainly due to the common mechanism of pathophysiology.

<doc id="44062" wikidata="Q1852" url="?curid=44062" title="X-ray astronomy">
<text>X-ray astronomy is an observational branch of astronomy which deals with the study of X-ray observation and detection from astronomical objects. X-radiation is absorbed by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons, sounding rockets, and satellites. X-ray astronomy uses a type of space telescope that can see x-ray radiation which standard optical telescopes, such as the Mauna Kea Observatories, cannot.

X-ray emission is expected from astronomical objects that contain extremely hot gases at temperatures from about a million kelvin (K) to hundreds of millions of kelvin (MK). Moreover, the maintenance of the E-layer of ionized gas high in the Earth&#x27;s thermosphere also suggested a strong extraterrestrial source of X-rays. Although theory predicted that the Sun and the stars would be prominent X-ray sources, there was no way to verify this because Earth&#x27;s atmosphere blocks most extraterrestrial X-rays. It was not until ways of sending instrument packages to high altitudes were developed that these X-ray sources could be studied.

The existence of solar X-rays was confirmed early in the mid-twentieth century by V-2s converted to sounding rockets, and the detection of extra-terrestrial X-rays has been the primary or secondary mission of multiple satellites since 1958. The first cosmic (beyond the Solar System) X-ray source was discovered by a sounding rocket in 1962. Called Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1) (the first X-ray source found in the constellation Scorpius), the X-ray emission of Scorpius X-1 is 10,000 times greater than its visual emission, whereas that of the Sun is about a million times less. In addition, the energy output in X-rays is 100,000 times greater than the total emission of the Sun in all wavelengths.

Many thousands of X-ray sources have since been discovered. In addition, the intergalactic space in galaxy clusters is filled with a hot, but very dilute gas at a temperature between 100 and 1000 megakelvins (MK). The total amount of hot gas is five to ten times the total mass in the visible galaxies.

==History of X-ray astronomy==
In 1927, E.O. Hulburt of the US Naval Research Laboratory and associates Gregory Breit and Merle A. Tuve of the Carnegie Institution of Washington explored the possibility of equipping Robert H. Goddard&#x27;s rockets to explore the upper atmosphere. &quot;Two years later, he proposed an experimental program in which a rocket might be instrumented to explore the upper atmosphere, including detection of ultraviolet radiation and X-rays at high altitudes&quot;.

In the late 1930s, the presence of a very hot, tenuous gas surrounding the Sun was inferred indirectly from optical coronal lines of highly ionized species. The Sun has been known to be surrounded by a hot tenuous corona. In the mid-1940s radio observations revealed a radio corona around the Sun.

The beginning of the search for X-ray sources from above the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere was on August 5, 1948 12:07 GMT. A US Army (formerly German) V-2 rocket as part of Project Hermes was launched from White Sands Proving Grounds. The first solar X-rays were recorded by T. Burnight.

Through the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, the sensitivity of detectors increased greatly during the 60 years of X-ray astronomy. In addition, the ability to focus X-rays has developed enormously—allowing the production of high-quality images of many fascinating celestial objects.

==Sounding rocket flights==

The first sounding rocket flights for X-ray research were accomplished at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico with a V-2 rocket on January 28, 1949. A detector was placed in the nose cone section and the rocket was launched in a suborbital flight to an altitude just above the atmosphere. X-rays from the Sun were detected by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory Blossom experiment on board. 

An Aerobee 150 rocket launched on June 19, 1962 (UTC) detected the first X-rays emitted from a source outside our solar system (Scorpius X-1). It is now known that such X-ray sources as Sco X-1 are compact stars, such as neutron stars or black holes. Material falling into a black hole may emit X-rays, but the black hole itself does not. The energy source for the X-ray emission is gravity. Infalling gas and dust is heated by the strong gravitational fields of these and other celestial objects. Based on discoveries in this new field of X-ray astronomy, starting with Scorpius X-1, Riccardo Giacconi received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002.

The largest drawback to rocket flights is their very short duration (just a few minutes above the atmosphere before the rocket falls back to Earth) and their limited field of view. A rocket launched from the United States will not be able to see sources in the southern sky; a rocket launched from Australia will not be able to see sources in the northern sky.

===X-ray Quantum Calorimeter (XQC) project===

In astronomy, the interstellar medium (or ISM) is the gas and cosmic dust that pervade interstellar space: the matter that exists between the star systems within a galaxy. It fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding intergalactic medium. The interstellar medium consists of an extremely dilute (by terrestrial standards) mixture of ions, atoms, molecules, larger dust grains, cosmic rays, and (galactic) magnetic fields. The energy that occupies the same volume, in the form of electromagnetic radiation, is the interstellar radiation field.

Of interest is the hot ionized medium (HIM) consisting of a coronal cloud ejection from star surfaces at 106-107 K which emits X-rays. The ISM is turbulent and full of structure on all spatial scales. Stars are born deep inside large complexes of molecular clouds, typically a few parsecs in size. During their lives and deaths, stars interact physically with the ISM. Stellar winds from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant HII regions surrounding them) and shock waves created by supernovae inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures are stellar wind bubbles and superbubbles of hot gas. The Sun is currently traveling through the Local Interstellar Cloud, a denser region in the low-density Local Bubble.

To measure the spectrum of the diffuse X-ray emission from the interstellar medium over the energy range 0.07 to 1 keV, NASA launched a Black Brant 9 from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico on May 1, 2008. The Principal Investigator for the mission is Dr. Dan McCammon of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

==Balloons==

Balloon flights can carry instruments to altitudes of up to 40 km above sea level, where they are above as much as 99.997% of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Unlike a rocket where data are collected during a brief few minutes, balloons are able to stay aloft for much longer. However, even at such altitudes, much of the X-ray spectrum is still absorbed. X-rays with energies less than 35 keV (5,600 aJ) cannot reach balloons. On July 21, 1964, the Crab Nebula supernova remnant was discovered to be a hard X-ray (15–60 keV) source by a scintillation counter flown on a balloon launched from Palestine, Texas, United States. This was likely the first balloon-based detection of X-rays from a discrete cosmic X-ray source.

===High-energy focusing telescope===

The high-energy focusing telescope (HEFT) is a balloon-borne experiment to image astrophysical sources in the hard X-ray (20–100 keV) band. Its maiden flight took place in May 2005 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, USA. The angular resolution of HEFT is c. 1.5&#x27;. Rather than using a grazing-angle X-ray telescope, HEFT makes use of a novel tungsten-silicon multilayer coatings to extend the reflectivity of nested grazing-incidence mirrors beyond 10 keV. HEFT has an energy resolution of 1.0 keV full width at half maximum at 60 keV. HEFT was launched for a 25-hour balloon flight in May 2005. The instrument performed within specification and observed Tau X-1, the Crab Nebula.

===High-resolution gamma-ray and hard X-ray spectrometer (HIREGS)===
A balloon-borne experiment called the High-resolution gamma-ray and hard X-ray spectrometer (HIREGS) observed X-ray and gamma-rays emissions from the Sun and other astronomical objects. It was launched from McMurdo Station, Antarctica in December 1991 and 1992. Steady winds carried the balloon on a circumpolar flight lasting about two weeks each time.

The rockoon, a blend of &quot;rocket&quot; and &quot;balloon&quot;, was a solid fuel rocket that, rather than being immediately lit while on the ground, was first carried into the upper atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon. Then, once separated from the balloon at its maximum height, the rocket was automatically ignited. This achieved a higher altitude, since the rocket did not have to move through the lower thicker air layers that would have required much more chemical fuel.

The original concept of &quot;rockoons&quot; was developed by Cmdr. Lee Lewis, Cmdr. G. Halvorson, S. F. Singer, and James A. Van Allen during the Aerobee rocket firing cruise of the on March 1, 1949.

From July 17 to July 27, 1956, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) shipboard launched eight Deacon rockoons for solar ultraviolet and X-ray observations at ~30° N ~121.6° W, southwest of San Clemente Island, apogee: 120 km.

==X-ray telescopes and mirrors==

Satellites are needed because X-rays are absorbed by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons, sounding rockets, and satellites. X-ray telescopes (XRTs) have varying directionality or imaging ability based on glancing angle reflection rather than refraction or large deviation reflection.
This limits them to much narrower fields of view than visible or UV telescopes. The mirrors can be made of ceramic or metal foil.

The first X-ray telescope in astronomy was used to observe the Sun. The first X-ray picture (taken with a grazing incidence telescope) of the Sun was taken in 1963, by a rocket-borne telescope. On April 19, 1960, the very first X-ray image of the sun was taken using a pinhole camera on an Aerobee-Hi rocket.

The utilization of X-ray mirrors for extrasolar X-ray astronomy simultaneously requires:
* the ability to determine the location at the arrival of an X-ray photon in two dimensions and
* a reasonable detection efficiency.

==X-ray astronomy detectors==

X-ray astronomy detectors have been designed and configured primarily for energy and occasionally for wavelength detection using a variety of techniques usually limited to the technology of the time.

X-ray detectors collect individual X-rays (photons of X-ray electromagnetic radiation) and count the number of photons collected (intensity), the energy (0.12 to 120 keV) of the photons collected, wavelength (c. 0.008–8 nm), or how fast the photons are detected (counts per hour), to tell us about the object that is emitting them.

==Astrophysical sources of X-rays==

Several types of astrophysical objects emit, fluoresce, or reflect X-rays, from galaxy clusters, through black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) to galactic objects such as supernova remnants, stars, and binary stars containing a white dwarf (cataclysmic variable stars and super soft X-ray sources), neutron star or black hole (X-ray binaries). Some Solar System bodies emit X-rays, the most notable being the Moon, although most of the X-ray brightness of the Moon arises from reflected solar X-rays. A combination of many unresolved X-ray sources is thought to produce the observed X-ray background. The X-ray continuum can arise from bremsstrahlung, black-body radiation, synchrotron radiation, or what is called inverse Compton scattering of lower-energy photons by relativistic electrons, knock-on collisions of fast protons with atomic electrons, and atomic recombination, with or without additional electron transitions.

An intermediate-mass X-ray binary (IMXB) is a binary star system where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole. The other component is an intermediate mass star.

Hercules X-1 is composed of a neutron star accreting matter from a normal star (HZ Herculis) probably due to Roche lobe overflow. X-1 is the prototype for the massive X-ray binaries although it falls on the borderline, , between high- and low-mass X-ray binaries.

In July 2020, astronomers reported the observation of a &quot;hard tidal disruption event candidate&quot; associated with ASASSN-20hx, located near the nucleus of galaxy NGC 6297, and noted that the observation represented one of the &quot;very few tidal disruption events with hard powerlaw X-ray spectra&quot;.

==Celestial X-ray sources==

The celestial sphere has been divided into 88 constellations. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) constellations are areas of the sky. Each of these contains remarkable X-ray sources. Some of them have been identified from astrophysical modeling to be galaxies or black holes at the centers of galaxies. Some are pulsars. As with sources already successfully modeled by X-ray astrophysics, striving to understand the generation of X-rays by the apparent source helps to understand the Sun, the universe as a whole, and how these affect us on Earth. Constellations are an astronomical device for handling observation and precision independent of current physical theory or interpretation. Astronomy has been around for a long time. Physical theory changes with time. With respect to celestial X-ray sources, X-ray astrophysics tends to focus on the physical reason for X-ray brightness, whereas X-ray astronomy tends to focus on their classification, order of discovery, variability, resolvability, and their relationship with nearby sources in other constellations.
Within the constellations Orion and Eridanus and stretching across them is a soft X-ray &quot;hot spot&quot; known as the Orion-Eridanus Superbubble, the Eridanus Soft X-ray Enhancement, or simply the Eridanus Bubble, a 25° area of interlocking arcs of Hα emitting filaments. Soft X-rays are emitted by hot gas (T ~ 2–3 MK) in the interior of the superbubble. This bright object forms the background for the &quot;shadow&quot; of a filament of gas and dust. The filament is shown by the overlaid contours, which represent 100 micrometre emission from dust at a temperature of about 30 K as measured by IRAS. Here the filament absorbs soft X-rays between 100 and 300 eV, indicating that the hot gas is located behind the filament. This filament may be part of a shell of neutral gas that surrounds the hot bubble. Its interior is energized by ultraviolet (UV) light and stellar winds from hot stars in the Orion OB1 association. These stars energize a superbubble about 1200 lys across which is observed in the visual (Hα) and X-ray portions of the spectrum.

==Explorational X-ray astronomy==

Usually observational astronomy is considered to occur on Earth&#x27;s surface (or beneath it in neutrino astronomy). The idea of limiting observation to Earth includes orbiting the Earth. As soon as the observer leaves the cozy confines of Earth, the observer becomes a deep space explorer. Except for Explorer 1 and Explorer 3 and the earlier satellites in the series, usually if a probe is going to be a deep space explorer it leaves the Earth or an orbit around the Earth.

For a satellite or space probe to qualify as a deep space X-ray astronomer/explorer or &quot;astronobot&quot;/explorer, all it needs to carry aboard is an XRT or X-ray detector and leave Earth&#x27;s orbit.

&quot;Ulysses&quot; was launched October 6, 1990, and reached Jupiter for its &quot;gravitational slingshot&quot; in February 1992. It passed the south solar pole in June 1994 and crossed the ecliptic equator in February 1995. The solar X-ray and cosmic gamma-ray burst experiment (GRB) had 3 main objectives: study and monitor solar flares, detect and localize cosmic gamma-ray bursts, and in-situ detection of Jovian aurorae. &quot;Ulysses&quot; was the first satellite carrying a gamma burst detector which went outside the orbit of Mars. The hard X-ray detectors operated in the range 15–150 keV. The detectors consisted of 23-mm thick × 51-mm diameter CsI(Tl) crystals mounted via plastic light tubes to photomultipliers. The hard detector changed its operating mode depending on (1) measured count rate, (2) ground command, or (3) change in spacecraft telemetry mode. The trigger level was generally set for 8-sigma above background and the sensitivity is 10−6 erg/cm2 (1 nJ/m2). When a burst trigger is recorded, the instrument switches to record high resolution data, recording it to a 32-kbit memory for a slow telemetry read out. Burst data consist of either 16 s of 8-ms resolution count rates or 64 s of 32-ms count rates from the sum of the 2 detectors. There were also 16 channel energy spectra from the sum of the 2 detectors (taken either in 1, 2, 4, 16, or 32 second integrations). During &#x27;wait&#x27; mode, the data were taken either in 0.25 or 0.5 s integrations and 4 energy channels (with shortest integration time being 8 s). Again, the outputs of the 2 detectors were summed.

The &quot;Ulysses&quot; soft X-ray detectors consisted of 2.5-mm thick × 0.5 cm2 area Si surface barrier detectors. A 100 mg/cm2 beryllium foil front window rejected the low energy X-rays and defined a conical FOV of 75° (half-angle). These detectors were passively cooled and operate in the temperature range −35 to −55 °C. This detector had 6 energy channels, covering the range 5–20 keV.
==Theoretical X-ray astronomy==
Theoretical X-ray astronomy is a branch of theoretical astronomy that deals with the theoretical astrophysics and theoretical astrochemistry of X-ray generation, emission, and detection as applied to astronomical objects.

Like theoretical astrophysics, theoretical X-ray astronomy uses a wide variety of tools which include analytical models to approximate the behavior of a possible X-ray source and computational numerical simulations to approximate the observational data. Once potential observational consequences are available they can be compared with experimental observations. Observers can look for data that refutes a model or helps in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Most of the topics in astrophysics, astrochemistry, astrometry, and other fields that are branches of astronomy studied by theoreticians involve X-rays and X-ray sources. Many of the beginnings for a theory can be found in an Earth-based laboratory where an X-ray source is built and studied.

===Dynamos===
Dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating, convecting, and electrically conducting fluid acts to maintain a magnetic field. This theory is used to explain the presence of anomalously long-lived magnetic fields in astrophysical bodies. If some of the stellar magnetic fields are really induced by dynamos, then field strength might be associated with rotation rate.

===Astronomical models===

From the observed X-ray spectrum, combined with spectral emission results for other wavelength ranges, an astronomical model addressing the likely source of X-ray emission can be constructed. For example, with Scorpius X-1 the X-ray spectrum steeply drops off as X-ray energy increases up to 20 keV, which is likely for a thermal-plasma mechanism. In addition, there is no radio emission, and the visible continuum is roughly what would be expected from a hot plasma fitting the observed X-ray flux. The plasma could be a coronal cloud of a central object or a transient plasma, where the energy source is unknown, but could be related to the idea of a close binary.

In the Crab Nebula X-ray spectrum there are three features that differ greatly from Scorpius X-1: its spectrum is much harder, its source diameter is in light-years (ly)s, not astronomical units (AU), and its radio and optical synchrotron emission are strong. Its overall X-ray luminosity rivals the optical emission and could be that of a nonthermal plasma. However, the Crab Nebula appears as an X-ray source that is a central freely expanding ball of dilute plasma, where the energy content is 100 times the total energy content of the large visible and radio portion, obtained from the unknown source.

The &quot;Dividing Line&quot; as giant stars evolve to become red giants also coincides with the Wind and Coronal Dividing Lines. To explain the drop in X-ray emission across these dividing lines, a number of models have been proposed:
# low transition region densities, leading to low emission in coronae,
# high-density wind extinction of coronal emission,
# only cool coronal loops become stable,
# changes in a magnetic field structure to that an open topology, leading to a decrease of magnetically confined plasma, or
# changes in the magnetic dynamo character, leading to the disappearance of stellar fields leaving only small-scale, turbulence-generated fields among red giants.

==Analytical X-ray astronomy==
High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) are composed of OB supergiant companion stars and compact objects, usually neutron stars (NS) or black holes (BH). Supergiant X-ray binaries (SGXBs) are HMXBs in which the compact objects orbit massive companions with orbital periods of a few days (3–15 d), and in circular (or slightly eccentric) orbits. SGXBs show typical the hard X-ray spectra of accreting pulsars and most show strong absorption as obscured HMXBs. X-ray luminosity (&quot;L&quot;x) increases up to 1036 erg·s−1 (1029 watts).

The mechanism triggering the different temporal behavior observed between the classical SGXBs and the recently discovered supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXT)s is still debated.
==Stellar X-ray astronomy==
The first detection of stellar x-rays occurred on April 5, 1974, with the detection of X-rays from Capella. A rocket flight on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at Capella (α Aur). During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2–1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor. The X-ray luminosity of &quot;L&quot;x = 1031 erg·s−1 (1024 W) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun&#x27;s X-ray luminosity.

===Stellar coronae===
Coronal stars, or stars within a coronal cloud, are ubiquitous among the stars in the cool half of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Experiments with instruments aboard Skylab and Copernicus have been used to search for soft X-ray emission in the energy range ~0.14–0.284 keV from stellar coronae. The experiments aboard ANS succeeded in finding X-ray signals from Capella and Sirius (α CMa). X-ray emission from an enhanced solar-like corona was proposed for the first time. The high temperature of Capella&#x27;s corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using HEAO 1 required magnetic confinement unless it was a free-flowing coronal wind.

In 1977 Proxima Centauri is discovered to be emitting high-energy radiation in the XUV. In 1978, α Cen was identified as a low-activity coronal source. With the operation of the Einstein observatory, X-ray emission was recognized as a characteristic feature common to a wide range of stars covering essentially the whole Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The Einstein initial survey led to significant insights:
*X-ray sources abound among all types of stars, across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and across most stages of evolution,
*the X-ray luminosities and their distribution along the main sequence were not in agreement with the long-favored acoustic heating theories, but were now interpreted as the effect of magnetic coronal heating, and
*stars that are otherwise similar reveal large differences in their X-ray output if their rotation period is different.

To fit the medium-resolution spectrum of UX Arietis, subsolar abundances were required.

Stellar X-ray astronomy is contributing toward a deeper understanding of
*magnetic fields in magnetohydrodynamic dynamos,
*the release of energy in tenuous astrophysical plasmas through various plasma-physical processes, and
*the interactions of high-energy radiation with the stellar environment.

Current wisdom has it that the massive coronal main sequence stars are late-A or early F stars, a conjecture that is supported both by observation and by theory.

===Young, low-mass stars===
Newly formed stars are known as pre-main-sequence stars during the stage of stellar evolution before they reach the main-sequence. Stars in this stage (ages &lt;10 million years) produce X-rays in their stellar coronae. However, their X-ray emission is 103 to 105 times stronger than for main-sequence stars of similar masses.

X-ray emission for pre–main-sequence stars was discovered by the Einstein Observatory. This X-ray emission is primarily produced by magnetic reconnection flares in the stellar coronae, with many small flares contributing to the &quot;quiescent&quot; X-ray emission from these stars. Pre–main sequence stars have large convection zones, which in turn drive strong dynamos, producing strong surface magnetic fields. This leads to the high X-ray emission from these stars, which lie in the saturated X-ray regime, unlike main-sequence stars that show rotational modulation of X-ray emission. Other sources of X-ray emission include accretion hotspots and collimated outflows.

X-ray emission as an indicator of stellar youth is important for studies of star-forming regions. Most star-forming regions in the Milky Way Galaxy are projected on Galactic-Plane fields with numerous unrelated field stars. It is often impossible to distinguish members of a young stellar cluster from field-star contaminants using optical and infrared images alone. X-ray emission can easily penetrate moderate absorption from molecular clouds, and can be used to identify candidate cluster members.

===Unstable winds===
Given the lack of a significant outer convection zone, theory predicts the absence of a magnetic dynamo in earlier A stars. In early stars of spectral type O and B, shocks developing in unstable winds are the likely source of X-rays.

===Coolest M dwarfs===
Beyond spectral type M5, the classical αω dynamo can no longer operate as the internal structure of dwarf stars changes significantly: they become fully convective. As a distributed (or α2) dynamo may become relevant, both the magnetic flux on the surface and the topology of the magnetic fields in the corona should systematically change across this transition, perhaps resulting in some discontinuities in the X-ray characteristics around spectral class dM5. However, observations do not seem to support this picture: long-time lowest-mass X-ray detection, VB 8 (M7e V), has shown steady emission at levels of X-ray luminosity (&quot;L&quot;X) ≈ 1026 erg·s−1 (1019 W) and flares up to an order of magnitude higher. Comparison with other late M dwarfs shows a rather continuous trend.

===Strong X-ray emission from Herbig Ae/Be stars===

Herbig Ae/Be stars are pre-main sequence stars. As to their X-ray emission properties, some are
* reminiscent of hot stars,
* others point to coronal activity as in cool stars, in particular the presence of flares and very high temperatures.

The nature of these strong emissions has remained controversial with models including
* unstable stellar winds,
* colliding winds,
* magnetic coronae,
* disk coronae,
* wind-fed magnetospheres,
* accretion shocks,
* the operation of a shear dynamo,
* the presence of unknown late-type companions.

===K giants===
The FK Com stars are giants of spectral type K with an unusually rapid rotation and signs of extreme activity. Their X-ray coronae are among the most luminous (&quot;L&quot;X ≥ 1032 erg·s−1 or 1025 W) and the hottest known with dominant temperatures up to 40 MK. However, the current popular hypothesis involves a merger of a close binary system in which the orbital angular momentum of the companion is transferred to the primary.

Pollux is the brightest star in the constellation Gemini, despite its Beta designation, and the 17th brightest in the sky. Pollux is a giant orange K star that makes an interesting color contrast with its white &quot;twin&quot;, Castor. Evidence has been found for a hot, outer, magnetically supported corona around Pollux, and the star is known to be an X-ray emitter.

===Eta Carinae===
New X-ray observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory show three distinct structures: an outer, horseshoe-shaped ring about 2 light years in diameter, a hot inner core about 3 light-months in diameter, and a hot central source less than 1 light-month in diameter which may contain the superstar that drives the whole show. The outer ring provides evidence of another large explosion that occurred over 1,000 years ago. These three structures around Eta Carinae are thought to represent shock waves produced by matter rushing away from the superstar at supersonic speeds. The temperature of the shock-heated gas ranges from 60 MK in the central regions to 3 MK on the horseshoe-shaped outer structure. &quot;The Chandra image contains some puzzles for existing ideas of how a star can produce such hot and intense X-rays,&quot; says Prof. Kris Davidson of the University of Minnesota. Davidson is principal investigator for the Eta Carina observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. &quot;In the most popular theory, X-rays are made by colliding gas streams from two stars so close together that they&#x27;d look like a point source to us. But what happens to gas streams that escape to farther distances? The extended hot stuff in the middle of the new image gives demanding new conditions for any theory to meet.&quot;

==Amateur X-ray astronomy==

Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. The United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) is the home of the US&#x27;s only undergraduate satellite program, and has and continues to develop the FalconLaunch sounding rockets. In addition to any direct amateur efforts to put X-ray astronomy payloads into space, there are opportunities that allow student-developed experimental payloads to be put on board commercial sounding rockets as a free-of-charge ride.

There are major limitations to amateurs observing and reporting experiments in X-ray astronomy: the cost of building an amateur rocket or balloon to place a detector high enough and the cost of appropriate parts to build a suitable X-ray detector.

==Major questions in X-ray astronomy==
As X-ray astronomy uses a major spectral probe to peer into the source, it is a valuable tool in efforts to understand many puzzles.

===Stellar magnetic fields===
Magnetic fields are ubiquitous among stars, yet we do not understand precisely why, nor have we fully understood the bewildering variety of plasma physical mechanisms that act in stellar environments. Some stars, for example, seem to have magnetic fields, fossil stellar magnetic fields left over from their period of formation, while others seem to generate the field anew frequently.

===Extrasolar X-ray source astrometry===

With the initial detection of an extrasolar X-ray source, the first question usually asked is &quot;What is the source?&quot; An extensive search is often made in other wavelengths such as visible or radio for possible coincident objects. Many of the verified X-ray locations still do not have readily discernible sources. X-ray astrometry becomes a serious concern that results in ever greater demands for finer angular resolution and spectral radiance.

There are inherent difficulties in making X-ray/optical, X-ray/radio, and X-ray/X-ray identifications based solely on positional coincidents, especially with handicaps in making identifications, such as the large uncertainties in positional determinants made from balloons and rockets, poor source separation in the crowded region toward the galactic center, source variability, and the multiplicity of source nomenclature.

X‐ray source counterparts to stars can be identified by calculating the angular separation between source centroids and the position of the star. The maximum allowable separation is a compromise between a larger value to identify as many real matches as possible and a smaller value to minimize the probability of spurious matches. &quot;An adopted matching criterion of 40&quot; finds nearly all possible X‐ray source matches while keeping the probability of any spurious matches in the sample to 3%.&quot;

===Solar X-ray astronomy===

All of the detected X-ray sources at, around, or near the Sun appear to be associated with processes in the corona, which is its outer atmosphere.

====Coronal heating problem====
In the area of solar X-ray astronomy, there is the coronal heating problem. The photosphere of the Sun has an effective temperature of 5,570 K yet its corona has an average temperature of 1–2 × 106 K. However, the hottest regions are 8–20 × 106 K. The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere.

It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient gas in the form of heat. The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.

Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.

====Coronal mass ejection====
A coronal mass ejection (CME) is an ejected plasma consisting primarily of electrons and protons (in addition to small quantities of heavier elements such as helium, oxygen, and iron), plus the entraining coronal closed magnetic field regions. Evolution of these closed magnetic structures in response to various photospheric motions over different time scales (convection, differential rotation, meridional circulation) somehow leads to the CME. Small-scale energetic signatures such as plasma heating (observed as compact soft X-ray brightening) may be indicative of impending CMEs.

The soft X-ray sigmoid (an S-shaped intensity of soft X-rays) is an observational manifestation of the connection between coronal structure and CME production. &quot;Relating the sigmoids at X-ray (and other) wavelengths to magnetic structures and current systems in the solar atmosphere is the key to understanding their relationship to CMEs.&quot;

The first detection of a Coronal mass ejection (CME) as such was made on December 1, 1971, by R. Tousey of the US Naval Research Laboratory using OSO 7. Earlier observations of coronal transients or even phenomena observed visually during solar eclipses are now understood as essentially the same thing.

The largest geomagnetic perturbation, resulting presumably from a &quot;prehistoric&quot; CME, coincided with the first-observed solar flare, in 1859. The flare was observed visually by Richard Christopher Carrington and the geomagnetic storm was observed with the recording magnetograph at Kew Gardens. The same instrument recorded a crotchet, an instantaneous perturbation of the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere by ionizing soft X-rays. This could not easily be understood at the time because it predated the discovery of X-rays (by Roentgen) and the recognition of the ionosphere (by Kennelly and Heaviside).

==Exotic X-ray sources==

A microquasar is a smaller cousin of a quasar that is a radio emitting X-ray binary, with an often resolvable pair of radio jets.
LSI+61°303 is a periodic, radio-emitting binary system that is also the gamma-ray source, CG135+01.
Observations are revealing a growing number of recurrent X-ray transients, characterized by short outbursts with very fast rise times (tens of minutes) and typical durations of a few hours that are associated with OB supergiants and hence define a new class of massive X-ray binaries: Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs).
Observations made by Chandra indicate the presence of loops and rings in the hot X-ray emitting gas that surrounds Messier 87. A magnetar is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field, the decay of which powers the emission of copious amounts of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, particularly X-rays and gamma rays.

==X-ray dark stars==

During the solar cycle, as shown in the sequence of images at right, at times the Sun is almost X-ray dark, almost an X-ray variable. Betelgeuse, on the other hand, appears to be always X-ray dark. Hardly any X-rays are emitted by red giants. There is a rather abrupt onset of X-ray emission around spectral type A7-F0, with a large range of luminosities developing across spectral class F. Altair is spectral type A7V and Vega is A0V. Altair&#x27;s total X-ray luminosity is at least an order of magnitude larger than the X-ray luminosity for Vega. The outer convection zone of early F stars is expected to be very shallow and absent in A-type dwarfs, yet the acoustic flux from the interior reaches a maximum for late A and early F stars provoking investigations of magnetic activity in A-type stars along three principal lines. Chemically peculiar stars of spectral type Bp or Ap are appreciable magnetic radio sources, most Bp/Ap stars remain undetected, and of those reported early on as producing X-rays only few of them can be identified as probably single stars. X-ray observations offer the possibility to detect (X-ray dark) planets as they eclipse part of the corona of their parent star while in transit. &quot;Such methods are particularly promising for low-mass stars as a Jupiter-like planet could eclipse a rather significant coronal area.&quot;

==X-ray dark planets and comets==
X-ray observations offer the possibility to detect (X-ray dark) planets as they eclipse part of the corona of their parent star while in transit. &quot;Such methods are particularly promising for low-mass stars as a Jupiter-like planet could eclipse a rather significant coronal area.&quot;

As X-ray detectors have become more sensitive, they have observed that some planets and other normally X-ray non-luminescent celestial objects under certain conditions emit, fluoresce, or reflect X-rays.

===Comet Lulin===
NASA&#x27;s Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission satellite was monitoring Comet Lulin as it closed to 63 Gm of Earth. For the first time, astronomers can see simultaneous UV and X-ray images of a comet. &quot;The solar wind—a fast-moving stream of particles from the sun—interacts with the comet&#x27;s broader cloud of atoms. This causes the solar wind to light up with X-rays, and that&#x27;s what Swift&#x27;s XRT sees&quot;, said Stefan Immler, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This interaction, called charge exchange, results in X-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times Earth&#x27;s distance from the Sun. Because Lulin is so active, its atomic cloud is especially dense. As a result, the X-ray-emitting region extends far sunward of the comet.

<text>Extragalactic astronomy is the branch of astronomy concerned with objects outside the Milky Way galaxy. In other words, it is the study of all astronomical objects which are not covered by galactic astronomy.

The closest objects in extragalactic astronomy include the galaxies of the Local Group, which are close enough to allow very detailed analyses of their contents (e.g. supernova remnants, stellar associations). As instrumentation has improved, distant objects can now be examined in more detail and so extragalactic astronomy includes objects at nearly the edge of the observable universe. Research into distant galaxies (outside of our local group) is valuable for studying aspects of the universe such as galaxy evolution and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) which give insight into physical phenomena (e.g. super massive black hole accretion and the presence of dark matter). It is through extragalactic astronomy that astronomers and physicists are able to study the effects of General Relativity such as gravitational lensing and gravitational waves, that are otherwise impossible (or nearly impossible) to study on a galactic scale.

A key interest in Extragalactic Astronomy is the study of how galaxies behave and interact through the universe. Astronomer&#x27;s methodologies depend — from theoretical to observation based methods.

Galaxies form in various ways. In most Cosmological &quot;N&quot;-body simulations, the earliest galaxies in the cosmos formed in the first hundreds of millions of years.

These primordial galaxies formed as the enormous reservoirs of gas and dust in the early universe collapsed in on themselves, giving birth to the first stars, now known as Population III Stars. These stars were of enormous masses in the range of 300 to perhaps 3 million solar masses. Due to their large mass, these stars had extremely short lifespans.

<text>Vulcan () was a proposed planet that some pre-20th century astronomers thought existed in an orbit between Mercury and the Sun. Speculation about, and even purported observations of, intermercurial bodies or planets date back to the beginning of the 17th century. The case for their probable existence was bolstered by the support of the French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier, who had predicted the existence of Neptune using disturbances in the orbit of Uranus. By 1859 he had confirmed unexplained peculiarities in Mercury&#x27;s orbit and predicted that they had to be the result of the gravitational influence of another unknown nearby planet or series of asteroids. A French amateur astronomer&#x27;s report that he had observed an object passing in front of the Sun that same year led Le Verrier to announce that the long sought after planet, which he gave the name Vulcan, had been discovered at last.

Many searches were conducted for Vulcan over the following decades, but despite several claimed observations, its existence could not be confirmed. The need for the planet as an explanation for Mercury&#x27;s orbital peculiarities was later rendered unnecessary when Einstein&#x27;s 1915 theory of general relativity showed that Mercury&#x27;s departure from an orbit predicted by Newtonian physics was explained by effects arising from the curvature of spacetime caused by the Sun&#x27;s mass.

== Hypotheses and observations ==

Celestial bodies interior to the orbit of Mercury had been hypothesized, searched for, and even claimed as having been observed, for centuries.

Claims of actually seeing objects passing in front of the Sun included those made by the German astronomer Christoph Scheiner in 1611 (which turned out to be the discovery of sunspots), British lawyer, writer and amateur astronomer Capel Lofft&#x27;s observations of &#x27;an opaque body traversing the sun&#x27;s disc&#x27; on 6 January 1818, and Bavarian physician and astronomer Franz von Paula Gruithuisen&#x27;s 26 June 1819 report of seeing &quot;two small spots...on the Sun, round, black and unequal in size&quot;. German astronomer reported many observations also claiming to have seen two spots, with the first observation on 23 October 1822 and subsequent observations in 1823, 1834, 1836, and 1837; in 1834 the larger spot was recorded as 3 arcseconds across, and the smaller 1.25 arcseconds.

Proposals that there could be planets orbiting inside Mercury&#x27;s orbit were put forward by British scientist Thomas Dick in 1838 and by French physicist, mathematician, and astronomer Jacques Babinet in 1846 who suggested there may be &quot;incandescent clouds of a planetary kind, circling the Sun&quot; and proposed the name &quot;Vulcan&quot; (after the god Vulcan from Roman mythology) for a planet close to the Sun.

As a planet near the Sun would be lost in its glare, several observers mounted systematic searches to try to catch it during &quot;transit&quot;, i.e. when it passes in front of the Sun&#x27;s disc. German amateur astronomer Heinrich Schwabe searched unsuccessfully on every clear day from 1826 to 1843 and Yale scientist Edward Claudius Herrick conducted observations twice daily starting in 1847, hoping to catch a planet in transit. French physician and amateur astronomer Edmond Modeste Lescarbault began searching the Sun&#x27;s disk in 1853, and more systematically after 1858, with a 3.75 inch (95 mm) refractor in an observatory he set up outside his surgery.

== Le Verrier&#x27;s prediction ==
In 1840, François Arago, the director of the Paris Observatory, suggested to mathematician Urbain Le Verrier that he work on the topic of Mercury&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. The goal of this study was to construct a model based on Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and gravitation. By 1843, Le Verrier published his provisional theory regarding Mercury&#x27;s motion, with a detailed presentation published in 1845, which would be tested during a transit of Mercury across the face of the Sun in 1848. Predictions from Le Verrier&#x27;s theory failed to match the observations.

Despite this, Le Verrier continued his work and, in 1859, published a more thorough study of Mercury&#x27;s motion. This was based on a series of meridian observations of the planet and 14 transits. This study&#x27;s rigor meant that any differences between the motion predicted and what was observed would point to the influence of an unknown factor. Indeed, some discrepancies remained. During Mercury&#x27;s orbit, its perihelion advances by a small amount, something called perihelion precession. The observed value exceeds the classical mechanics prediction by the small amount of 43 arcseconds per century.

Le Verrier postulated that the excess precession could be explained by the presence of some unidentified object or objects inside the orbit of Mercury. He calculated that it was either another Mercury size planet or, since it was unlikely that astronomers were failing to see such a large object, an unknown asteroid belt near the Sun.

The fact that Le Verrier had predicted the existence of the planet Neptune in 1846 using the same techniques lent veracity to his claim.

=== Claimed discovery ===
On 22 December 1859, Le Verrier received a letter from Lescarbault, saying that he had seen a transit of the hypothetical planet on March 26 of that year. Le Verrier took the train to the village of Orgères-en-Beauce, some southwest of Paris, to Lescarbault&#x27;s homemade observatory. Le Verrier arrived unannounced and proceeded to interrogate the man.

Lescarbault described in detail how, on 26 March 1859, he observed a small black dot on the face of the Sun. After some time had passed, he realized that it was moving. He thought it looked similar to the transit of Mercury which he had observed in 1845. He estimated the distance it had already traveled, made some measurements of its position and direction of motion and, using an old clock and a pendulum with which he took his patients&#x27; pulses, estimated the total duration of the transit (coming up with 1 hour, 17 minutes, and 9 seconds).

Le Verrier was not happy about Lescarbault&#x27;s crude equipment but was satisfied the physician had seen the transit of a previously unknown planet. On 2 January 1860 he announced the discovery of the new planet with the proposed name from mythology, &quot;Vulcan&quot;, at the meeting of the Académie des Sciences in Paris. Lescarbault, for his part, was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur and invited to appear before numerous learned societies.

Not everyone accepted the veracity of Lescarbault&#x27;s &quot;discovery&quot;, however. An eminent French astronomer, Emmanuel Liais, who was working for the Brazilian government in Rio de Janeiro in 1859, claimed to have been studying the surface of the Sun with a telescope twice as powerful as Lescarbault&#x27;s at the very moment that Lescarbault said he observed his mysterious transit. Liais, therefore, was &quot;in a condition to deny, in the most positive manner, the passage of a planet over the sun at the time indicated&quot;.

Based on Lescarbault&#x27;s &quot;transit&quot;, Le Verrier computed Vulcan&#x27;s orbit: it supposedly revolved about the Sun in a nearly circular orbit at a distance of . The period of revolution was 19 days and 17 hours, and the orbit was inclined to the ecliptic by 12 degrees and 10 minutes (an incredible degree of precision). As seen from the Earth, Vulcan&#x27;s greatest elongation from the Sun was 8 degrees.

=== Attempts to confirm the discovery ===
Numerous reports reached Le Verrier from other amateurs who claimed to have seen unexplained transits. Some of these reports referred to observations made many years earlier, and many were not dated, let alone accurately timed. Nevertheless, Le Verrier continued to tinker with Vulcan&#x27;s orbital parameters as each newly reported sighting reached him. He frequently announced dates of future Vulcan transits. When these failed to materialize, he tinkered with the parameters some more.

Shortly after 08:00 on 29 January 1860, F.A.R. Russell and three other people in London saw an alleged transit of an intra-Mercurial planet. An American observer, Richard Covington, many years later claimed to have seen a well-defined black spot progress across the Sun&#x27;s disk around 1860 when he was stationed in Washington Territory.

No observations of Vulcan were made in 1861. Then, on the morning of 20 March 1862, between 08:00 and 09:00 Greenwich Time, another amateur astronomer, a Mr. Lummis of Manchester, England, saw a transit. His colleague, whom he alerted, also saw the event. Based on these two men&#x27;s reports, two French astronomers, Benjamin Valz and Rodolphe Radau, independently calculated the object&#x27;s supposed orbital period, with Valz deriving a figure of 17 days and 13 hours and Radau a figure of 19 days and 22 hours.

On 8 May 1865 another French astronomer, Aristide Coumbary, observed an unexpected transit from Istanbul, Turkey.

Between 1866 and 1878, no reliable observations of the hypothetical planet were made. Then, during the total solar eclipse of July 29, 1878, two experienced astronomers, Professor James Craig Watson, the director of the Ann Arbor Observatory in Michigan, and Lewis Swift, from Rochester, New York, both claimed to have seen a Vulcan-type planet close to the Sun. Watson, observing from Separation Point, Wyoming, placed the planet about 2.5 degrees southwest of the Sun and estimated its magnitude at 4.5. Swift, observing the eclipse from a location near Denver, Colorado, saw what he took to be an intra-mercurial planet about 3 degrees southwest of the Sun. He estimated its brightness to be the same as that of Theta Cancri, a fifth-magnitude star which was also visible during totality, about six or seven minutes from the &quot;planet&quot;. Theta Cancri and the planet were nearly in line with the Sun&#x27;s centre.

Watson and Swift had reputations as excellent observers. Watson had already discovered more than twenty asteroids, while Swift had several comets named after him. Both described the colour of their hypothetical intra-mercurial planet as &quot;red&quot;. Watson reported that it had a definite disk—unlike stars, which appear in telescopes as mere points of light—and that its phase indicated that it was on the far side of the Sun approaching superior conjunction.

Both Watson and Swift had observed two objects they believed were not known stars, but after Swift corrected an error in his coordinates, none of the coordinates matched each other, nor known stars. The idea that &quot;four&quot; objects were observed during the eclipse generated controversy in scientific journals and mockery from Watson&#x27;s rival C. H. F. Peters. Peters noted that the margin of error in the pencil and cardboard recording device Watson had used was large enough to plausibly include a bright known star. A skeptic of the Vulcan hypothesis, Peters dismissed all the observations as mistaking known stars as planets. 

Astronomers continued searching for Vulcan during total solar eclipses in 1883, 1887, 1889, 1900, 1901, 1905, and 1908. Finally, in 1908, William Wallace Campbell, Director, and Charles Dillon Perrine, Astronomer, of the Lick Observatory, after comprehensive photographic observations at three solar eclipse expeditions in 1901, 1905, and 1908, stated: &quot;In our opinion, the work of the three Crocker Expeditions...brings the observational side of the intermercurial planet problemfamous for half a centurydefinitely to a close.&quot;

== Hypothesis disproved ==
In 1915 Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, an approach to understanding gravity entirely differently from classical mechanics, removed the need for Le Verrier&#x27;s hypothetical planet. It showed that the peculiarities in Mercury&#x27;s orbit were the results of the curvature of spacetime caused by the mass of the Sun. This added a predicted 0.1 arc-second advance of Mercury&#x27;s perihelion each orbital revolution, or 43 arc-seconds per century, exactly the observed amount (without any recourse to the existence of a hypothetical Vulcan). The new theory modified the predicted orbits of all planets, but the magnitude of the differences from Newtonian theory diminishes rapidly as one gets farther from the Sun. Also, Mercury&#x27;s fairly eccentric orbit makes it much easier to detect the perihelion shift than is the case for the nearly circular orbits of Venus and Earth. Einstein&#x27;s theory was empirically verified in the Eddington experiment during the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919 when photographs showed the curvature of spacetime was bending starlight around the Sun. Astronomers generally quickly accepted that a large planet inside the orbit of Mercury could not exist, given the corrected equation of gravity.

Today, the International Astronomical Union has reserved the name &quot;Vulcan&quot; for the hypothetical planet, even though it has been ruled out, and also for the Vulcanoids, a hypothetical population of asteroids that may exist inside the orbit of the planet Mercury. Thus far, however, earth- and space-based telescopes and the NASA Parker Solar Probe have detected no such asteroids. While three Atira asteroids have perihelion points within the orbit of Mercury, their aphelia are outside Mercury&#x27;s orbit. Therefore, they cannot be defined as Vulcanoids, which would require wholly intra-Mercurian circular orbital trajectories, which none of them possess.

<text>The Avro Vulcan (later Hawker Siddeley Vulcan from July 1963) was a jet-powered, tailless, delta-wing, high-altitude, strategic bomber, which was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1956 until 1984. Aircraft manufacturer A.V. Roe and Company (Avro) designed the Vulcan in response to Specification B.35/46. Of the three V bombers produced, the Vulcan was considered the most technically advanced, hence the riskiest option. Several reduced-scale aircraft, designated Avro 707s, were produced to test and refine the delta-wing design principles.

The Vulcan B.1 was first delivered to the RAF in 1956; deliveries of the improved Vulcan B.2 started in 1960. The B.2 featured more powerful engines, a larger wing, an improved electrical system, and electronic countermeasures, and many were modified to accept the Blue Steel missile. As a part of the V-force, the Vulcan was the backbone of the United Kingdom&#x27;s airborne nuclear deterrent during much of the Cold War. Although the Vulcan was typically armed with nuclear weapons, it could also carry out conventional bombing missions, which it did in Operation Black Buck during the Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina in 1982.

The Vulcan had no defensive weaponry, initially relying upon high-speed, high-altitude flight to evade interception. Electronic countermeasures were employed by the B.1 (designated B.1A) and B.2 from around 1960. A change to low-level tactics was made in the mid-1960s. In the mid-1970s, nine Vulcans were adapted for maritime radar reconnaissance operations, redesignated as B.2 (MRR). In the final years of service, six Vulcans were converted to the K.2 tanker configuration for aerial refuelling.

After retirement by the RAF, one example, B.2 XH558, named &quot;The Spirit of Great Britain&quot;, was restored for use in display flights and air shows, whilst two other B.2s, XL426 and XM655, have been kept in taxiable condition for ground runs and demonstrations. B.2 XH558 flew for the last time in October 2015 and is also being kept in taxiable condition.
XM612 is on display at Norwich Aviation Museum.

==Development==

===Origins===
The origin of the Vulcan and the other V bombers is linked with early British atomic weapon programme and nuclear deterrent policies. Britain&#x27;s atom bomb programme began with Air Staff Operational Requirement OR.1001 issued in August 1946. This anticipated a government decision in January 1947 to authorise research and development work on atomic weapons, the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) having prohibited exporting atomic knowledge, even to countries that had collaborated on the Manhattan Project. OR.1001 envisaged a weapon not to exceed in length, in diameter and in weight. The weapon had to be suitable for release from .

In January 1947, the Ministry of Supply distributed Specification B.35/46 to UK aviation companies to satisfy Air Staff Operational Requirement OR.229 for &quot;a medium range bomber landplane capable of carrying one bomb to a target from a base which may be anywhere in the world.&quot; A cruising speed of at altitudes between was specified. The maximum weight when fully loaded should not exceed . Alternatively, the aircraft was to be capable of carrying a conventional bomb load of . The similar OR.230 required a &quot;long-range bomber&quot; with a radius of action with a maximum weight of when fully loaded; this requirement was considered too exacting. Six companies submitted technical brochures to this specification, including Avro.

Required to tender by the end of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by technical director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was &quot;Avro 698&quot;. As was obvious to the design team, conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification. No worthwhile information about high-speed flight was available from the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) or the US. Avro were aware that Alexander Lippisch had designed a delta-wing fighter and considered the same delta configuration would be suitable for their bomber. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Although Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick&#x27;s team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wings on either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb bays.

In August 1947, Chadwick was killed in the crash of the Avro Tudor 2 prototype, and was succeeded by Sir William Farren. Reductions in wing thickness made incorporating the split bomb bays and stacked engines impossible, thus the engines were placed side by side in pairs on either side of a single bomb bay, with the fuselage growing somewhat. The wingtip fins gave way to a single fin on the aircraft&#x27;s centreline. Rival manufacturer Handley Page received a prototype contract for its crescent-winged HP.80 B.35/46 tender in November 1947. Although considered the best option, the contract award for Avro&#x27;s design was delayed while its technical strength was established. Instructions to proceed with the construction of two Avro 698 prototypes were received in January 1948. As an insurance measure against both radical designs failing, Short Brothers received a contract for the prototype SA.4 to the less-stringent Specification B.14/46. The SA.4, later named Sperrin, was not required. In April 1948, Vickers also received authority to proceed with their Type 660, which, although falling short of the B.35/46 Specification, but being of a more conventional design, would be available sooner. This plane entered service as the Valiant.

===Avro 707 and Avro 710===

As Avro had no flight experience of the delta wing, the company planned two smaller experimental aircraft based on the 698, the one-third scale model 707 for low-speed handling and the one-half scale model 710 for high-speed handling. Two of each were ordered. The 710 was cancelled when it was considered too time-consuming to develop; a high-speed variant of the 707 was designed in its place, the 707A. The first 707, VX784, flew in September 1949, but crashed later that month, killing the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment&#x27;s chief test pilot Squadron Leader Samuel Eric Esler, DFC, AE. The second low-speed 707, VX790, built with the still uncompleted 707A&#x27;s nose section (containing an ejection seat) and redesignated 707B, flew in September 1950 piloted by Avro test pilot Wg Cdr Roland &quot;Roly&quot; Falk. The high-speed 707A, WD280, followed in July 1951.

Due to the delay of the 707 programme, the contribution of the 707B and 707A towards the basic design of the 698 was not considered significant, though it did highlight a need to increase the length of the nosewheel to give a ground incidence of 3.5°, the optimum take-off attitude. The 707B and 707A proved the design&#x27;s validity and gave confidence in the delta planform. A second 707A, WZ736, and a two-seat 707C, WZ744, were also constructed, but they played no part in the 698&#x27;s development.

===Prototypes and type certification===

====First prototype VX770 and name====

More influential than the Avro 707 in the 698&#x27;s design was the wind-tunnel testing performed at RAE Farnborough. This necessitated a wing redesign incorporating a cranked and drooped leading edge and vortex generators to avoid the onset of compressibility drag, which would have restricted the maximum speed. This wing modification resulted in the &quot;phase 2&quot; wing which was first investigated on Avro 707A WD480. This modification was too late to be incorporated on the two prototype 698s and the first three B.1 aircraft before their first flights. (The B.1s were quickly retrofitted).

Painted gloss white, the 698 prototype VX770, with its pure delta wing, flew for the first time on 30 August 1952 piloted by Roly Falk flying solo. VX770, fitted with only the first pilot&#x27;s ejection seat and a conventional control wheel, was powered by four Rolls-Royce RA.3 Avon engines of thrust, its intended Bristol Olympus engines not being available. The prototype had fuselage fuel tanks but no wing tanks, so temporary additional tankage was carried in the bomb bay. VX770 made an appearance at the 1952 Society of British Aircraft Constructors&#x27; (SBAC) Farnborough Air Show the next month when Falk demonstrated an almost vertical bank.

After its Farnborough appearance, the future name of the Avro 698 was a subject of speculation. Avro had strongly recommended the name &quot;Ottawa&quot;, in honour of the company&#x27;s connection with Avro Canada. The weekly magazine &quot;Flight&quot; suggested &quot;Albion&quot; after rejecting &quot;Avenger&quot;, &quot;Apollo&quot;, and &quot;Assegai&quot;. The chief of the air staff preferred a V-class of bombers, and the Air Council announced the following month that the 698 would be called &quot;Vulcan&quot; after the Roman god of fire and destruction.

In January 1953, VX770 was grounded for the installation of wing fuel tanks, Armstrong Siddeley ASSa.6 Sapphire engines of thrust and other systems; it flew again in July 1953.

From 1957, VX770 was used as the flying testbed for the Rolls-Royce Conway by-pass engine. It crashed at a flying display at RAF Syerston in September 1958.

====Second prototype VX777====
The second prototype, VX777, first flew on 3 September 1953. More representative of production aircraft, it was lengthened to accommodate a longer nose undercarriage leg to increase the angle of attack of the wing, shortening the take-off run. It featured a visual bomb-aiming blister under the cabin and was fitted with Bristol Olympus 100 engines of thrust. At Falk&#x27;s suggestion, a fighter-style control stick had replaced the control wheel. Like VX770, VX777 had the original wing with straight leading edges. VX777 was joined in formation by the first prototype VX770 and four Avro 707s at the 1953 Farnborough Air Show. During trials in July 1954, VX777 was substantially damaged in a heavy landing at Farnborough. It was repaired, fitted with Olympus 101 engines of thrust before resuming trials with Avro and the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) at Boscombe Down.

====Testing and type certification====
While exploring VX777&#x27;s high-speed and high-altitude flight envelope at the A&amp;AEE, mild buffeting and other undesirable flight characteristics were experienced while approaching the limiting Mach number, including an alarming tendency to enter an uncontrollable dive. This was judged unacceptable for an unarmed bomber. Fitting the phase 2 wing removed the buffeting and an auto-mach trimmer countered the high-speed dive. The latter applied up-elevator as the speed critically increased. This up-elevator force was greater than the force required to counter the dive. Consequently, as speed increased, the control column had to be pushed rather than pulled to maintain level flight. This artificial pitch-up made the Vulcan handle more like other aircraft as its speed increased.

The first production B.1 XA889 first flew in February 1955 with the original wing and joined the trials in June. In September 1955, Falk, flying the second production B.1 XA890 (which had remained at Woodford as part of the MoS&#x27;s Air Fleet on radio trials), amazed crowds at the Farnborough Air Show by executing a barrel roll on his second flypast in front of the SBAC president&#x27;s tent. After two days of flying, he was called in front of service and civil aviation authorities and ordered to refrain from carrying out this &quot;dangerous&quot; manoeuvre. Now fitted with a phase 2 wing, XA889 was delivered in March 1956 to the A&amp;AEE for trials for the type&#x27;s initial Certificate of Airworthiness which it received the following month.

(In 1956, VX777 was modified with the even larger phase 2(C) wing. Fitted with Olympus 104 engines, it became the aerodynamic prototype of the Vulcan B.2.)

===Into service===

====Vulcan B.1 and B1A====
The first 15 production B.1s were powered by the Olympus 101. Many of these early examples in a metallic finish remained the property of the Ministry of Supply, being retained for trials and development purposes. Those entering RAF service were delivered to No 230 Operational Conversion Unit (OCU), the first in July 1956. Later aircraft, painted in anti-flash white and powered by the Olympus 102 with thrust, began to enter squadron service in July 1957. The Olympus 102s were modified during overhaul to the Olympus 104 standard, ultimately rated at thrust.

Rebuilding B.1s as B.2s was considered but rejected over cost. Nevertheless, to extend the B.1&#x27;s service life, 28 (the surviving B1 aircraft fitted with Olympus 102/104 engines) were upgraded by Armstrong Whitworth between 1959 and 1963 to the B.1A standard, including features of the B.2 such as ECM equipment, in-flight refuelling receiving equipment, and UHF radio. However, the B.1As were not strengthened for low-level operations and all were withdrawn by 1968.

====Vulcan B.2====
As far back as 1952, Bristol Aero Engines had begun development of the BOl.6 (Olympus 6) rated at thrust but if fitted to the B.1, this would have reintroduced the buffet requiring further redesign of the wing.

The decision to proceed with the B.2 versions of the Vulcan was made in May 1956, being developed by Avro&#x27;s chief designer Roy Ewans. The first B.2 was anticipated to be around the 45th aircraft of the 99 then on order. As well as being able to achieve greater heights over targets, operational flexibility was believed to be extended by the provision of in-flight refuelling equipment and tanker aircraft. The increasing sophistication of Soviet air defences required the fitting of electronic countermeasure (ECM) equipment, and vulnerability could be reduced by the introduction of the Avro Blue Steel stand-off missile, then in development. To develop these proposals, the second Vulcan prototype VX777 was rebuilt with the larger and thinner phase-2C wing, improved flying control surfaces, and Olympus 102 engines, first flying in this configuration in August 1957. Several Vulcan B.1s were used for the development of the B.2: development of the BOl.6 (later Olympus 200), XA891; a new AC electrical system, XA893; ECM including jammers within a bulged tail cone and a tail warning radar, XA895: and for Blue Steel development work, XA903.
The 46th production aircraft and first B.2, XH533, first flew in September 1958 using Olympus 200 engines, six months before the last B.1 XH532 was delivered in March 1959. The second B.2, XH534, flew in January 1959. Powered by production Olympus 201s with thrust, it was more representative of a production aircraft, being fitted with an in-flight refuelling probe and a bulged ECM tail cone. Some subsequent B.2s were initially lacking probes and ECM tail cones, but these were retrofitted. The first 10 B.2s outwardly showed their B.1 ancestry, retaining narrow engine air intakes. Anticipating even more powerful engines, the air intakes were deepened on the 11th (XH557) and subsequent aircraft. Many of the early aircraft were retained for trials, and the 12th B.2, XH558, was the first to be delivered to the RAF in July 1960. Coincidentally, XH558 was also the last Vulcan in service with the RAF, before being retired in 1992.

The 26th B.2, XL317, the first of a production batch ordered in February 1956, was the first Vulcan, apart from development aircraft, capable of carrying the Blue Steel missile; 33 aircraft were delivered to the RAF with these modifications. When the Mk.2 version of Blue Steel was cancelled in favour of the Douglas GAM-87 Skybolt air-launched ballistic missile in December 1959, fittings were changed in anticipation of the new missile, one under each wing. Though Skybolt was cancelled in November 1962, many aircraft were delivered or retrofitted with &quot;Skybolt&quot; blisters. Later aircraft were delivered with Olympus 301 engines with thrust. Two earlier aircraft were re-engined (XH557 and XJ784) for trials and development work; another seven aircraft were converted around 1963.

The last B.2 XM657 was delivered in 1965 and the type served until 1984. Whilst in service, the B.2 was continuously updated with modifications, including rapid engine starting, bomb-bay fuel tanks, wing strengthening to give the fatigue life to enable the aircraft to fly at low level (a tactic introduced in the mid-1960s), upgraded navigation equipment, terrain-following radar, standardisation on a common weapon (WE.177) and improved ECM equipment. Nine B.2s were modified for a maritime radar reconnaissance role and six for an airborne tanker role. An updated bomb rack assembly allowing the carriage of 30 1,000 lb bombs, up from 21 was demonstrated by Avro but was not introduced. The updated wing profile increased range to 4,000 nm (7,400 km).

===Proposed developments and cancelled projects===
;Avro Type 718:
The Avro 718 was a 1951 proposal for a delta-winged military transport based on the Type 698 to carry 80 troops or 110 passengers. It would have been powered by four Bristol Olympus BOl.3 engines.
;Avro Atlantic:

The Avro Type 722 Atlantic was a 1952 proposal (announced in June 1953) for a 120-passenger delta-winged airliner based on the Type 698.
;Avro Type 732:
The Avro 732 was a 1956 proposal for a supersonic development of the Vulcan and would have been powered by 8 de Havilland Gyron Junior engines. Unlike the proposed Avro 721 low-level bomber of 1952 or the Avro 730 supersonic stainless steel canard bomber dating from 1954 (cancelled in 1957 before completion of the prototype), the Type 732 showed its Vulcan heritage.
;Vulcan Phase 6 (Vulcan B.3)

In 1960, the Air Staff approached Avro with a request into a study for a patrol missile carrier armed with up to six Skybolt missiles capable of a mission length of 12 hours. Avro&#x27;s submission in May 1960 was the Phase 6 Vulcan, which would have been the Vulcan B.3. The aircraft was fitted with an enlarged wing of span with increased fuel capacity; additional fuel tanks in a dorsal spine; a new main undercarriage to carry an all-up-weight of ; and reheated Olympus 301s of thrust. An amended proposal of October 1960 inserted a plug into the forward fuselage with capacity for six crew members including a relief pilot, all facing forwards on ejection seats, and aft-fan versions of the Olympus 301.
;Fighter-support Vulcan

To counter improving Soviet defences after the cancellation of Skybolt, Avro proposed a Vulcan with three Gnat fighters slung underneath. The Gnats were to have been released in enemy airspace to provide fighter cover, and they were expected to land &quot;in friendly territory&quot; or return to the Vulcan to replenish their tanks by means of a specially installed flight-refuelling drogue.

===Export proposals===
Other countries expressed interest in purchasing Vulcans, but as with the other V-bombers, no foreign sales materialised.

;Australia:
As early as 1954, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) recognised that the English Electric Canberra might soon become outdated. Potential replacements, such as the Boeing B-47E, Handley-Page Victor and Vulcan were considered.

Political pressure for a Canberra replacement came to a head in 1962, by which time agile, supersonic bombers/strategic strike aircraft, such as the North American A-5 Vigilante, BAC TSR-2, General Dynamics F-111, had become available. Had the Australian government pre-ordered the TSR-2, several V-bombers, including Vulcans, would have been made available, for interim use by the RAAF; however, the F-111C was ordered. (The UK government almost followed that decision – after the cancellation of the TSR-2 – it was offered the similar F-111K.)

;Argentina:
In the early 1980s, Argentina approached the UK with a proposal to buy a number of Vulcans. An application, made in September 1981, requested the &#x27;early availability&#x27; of a &#x27;suitable aircraft&#x27;. With some reluctance, British ministers approved the export of a single aircraft but emphasised that clearance had not been given for the sale of a larger number. A letter from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the Ministry of Defence in January 1982 stated that little prospect was seen of this happening without ascertaining the Argentine interest and whether such interest was genuine: &#x27;On the face of it, a strike aircraft would be entirely suitable for an attack on the Falklands.&#x27; Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands less than three months later, after which a British embargo on the sale of any military equipment was quickly imposed.

==Design==

===Overview===
Despite its radical and unusual shape, the airframe was built along traditional lines. Except for the most highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down into a number of major assemblies: The centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and rear end of the fuselage; and a single swept tail fin with a single rudder was on the trailing edge.

A five-man crew was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the first pilot and co-pilot sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst on the lower level the navigator radar, navigator plotter, and air electronics officer (AEO) sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door. The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, but this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment; the rear crew&#x27;s escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. The visual bomb-aimer&#x27;s compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s, this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.

Fuel was carried in 14 bag tanks, four in the centre fuselage above and to the rear of the nosewheel bay, and five in each outer wing. The tanks were split into four groups of almost equal capacity, each normally feeding its respective engine, though cross-feeding was possible. The centre of gravity was automatically maintained by electric timers, which sequenced the booster pumps on the tanks. B.2 aircraft could be fitted with one or two additional fuel tanks in the bomb bay.

Despite being designed before a low radar cross-section and other stealth factors were ever a consideration, an RAE technical note of 1957 stated that of all the aircraft so far studied, the Vulcan appeared by far the simplest radar-echoing object, due to its shape; only one or two components contributed significantly to the echo at any aspect, compared with three or more on most other types.

===Colour schemes===

The two prototype Vulcans were finished in gloss white. Early Vulcan B.1s left the factory in a natural metal finish; the front half of the nose radome was painted black, the rear half painted silver. Front-line Vulcan B.1s had a finish of anti-flash white and RAF &quot;type D&quot; roundels. Front-line Vulcan B.1As and B.2s were similar, but with pale roundels.

With the adoption of low-level attack profiles in the mid-1960s, B.1As and B.2s were given a glossy sea grey medium and dark green disruptive pattern camouflage on the upper surfaces, white undersurfaces, and &quot;type D&quot; roundels. (The last 13 Vulcan B.2s, XM645 onwards, were delivered thus from the factory). In the mid-1970s, Vulcan B.2s received a similar scheme with matte camouflage, light aircraft grey undersides, and &quot;low-visibility&quot; roundels. B.2(MRR)s received a similar scheme in gloss; and the front halves of the radomes were no longer painted black. Beginning in 1979, 10 Vulcans received a wrap-around camouflage of dark sea grey and dark green because, during Red Flag exercises in the US, defending SAM forces had found that the grey-painted undersides of the Vulcan became much more visible against the ground at high angles of bank.
===Avionics===
The original Vulcan B.1 radio fit was: two 10-channel VHF transmitter/receivers (TR-1985/TR-1986) and an STR-18, 24-channel HF transmitter-receiver (R4187/T4188). The Vulcan B.1A also featured a UHF transmitter-receiver (ARC-52). The initial B.2 radio fit was similar to the B.1A though it was ultimately fitted with the ARC-52, a V/UHF transmitter/receiver (PTR-175), and a single-sideband modulation HF transmitter-receiver (Collins 618T).

The navigation and bombing system comprised an H2S Mk9 radar and a navigation bombing computer Mk1. Other navigation aids included a Marconi radio compass (ADF), GEE Mk3, Green Satin Doppler radar to determine the groundspeed and drift angle, radio and radar altimeters, and an instrument landing system. TACAN replaced GEE in the B.1A and B.2 in 1964. Decca Doppler 72 replaced Green Satin in the B.2 around 1969&lt;ref name=&#x27;PB&amp;E102/3&#x27;&gt;Price, Blackman and Edmonson 2010, pp. 102, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; A continuous display of the aircraft&#x27;s position was maintained by a ground position indicator.

Vulcan B.2s were eventually fitted with the free-running dual-gyroscopic heading reference system (HRS) Mk.2, based upon the inertial platform of the Blue Steel missile, which had been integrated into the system when the missile had been carried. With the HRS a navigator&#x27;s heading unit was provided, which enabled the navigator plotter to adjust the aircraft heading, through the autopilot, by as little as 0.1 degrees. The B.2 (MRR) was additionally fitted with the LORAN C navigation system.

The original ECM fit of the B.1A and B.2 was one Green Palm voice communications jammer; two Blue Diver metric jammers; three Red Shrimp S-band jammers; a Blue Saga passive warning receiver with four aerials; a Red Steer tail warning radar; and chaff dispensers. The bulk of the equipment was carried in a large, extended tail cone, and a flat ECM aerial counterpoise plate was mounted between the starboard tailpipes. Later equipment on the B.2 included: an L band jammer (replacing a Red Shrimp); the ARI 18146 X-band jammer; replacing the Green Palm; the improved Red Steer Mk.2; infra-red decoys (flares); and the ARI 18228 PWR with its aerials that gave a squared top to the fin.

===Controls===
The aircraft was controlled by a fighter-type control stick and rudder bar, which operated the powered flying controls, which each had a single electrohydraulic-powered flying control unit, except the rudder, which had two, one running as a back-up. Artificial feel and auto stabilisation in the form of pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto Mach trimmer.

The flight instruments in the B.1 were traditional and included &quot;G4B&quot; compasses; Mk.4 artificial horizons; and zero reader flight display instruments. The B.1 had a Smiths Mk10 autopilot. In the B.2, these features were incorporated into the Smiths Military Flight System (MFS), the pilots&#x27; components being: two beam compasses; two director-horizons; and an Mk.10A or Mk.10B autopilot. From 1966, B.2s were fitted with the &quot;ARI 5959&quot; TFR, built by General Dynamics, its commands being fed into the director-horizons.

The B.1 had four elevators (inboard) and four ailerons (outboard). In the B.2, these were replaced by eight elevons. The Vulcan was also fitted with six electrically operated three-position (retracted, medium drag, high drag) airbrakes, four in the upper centre section and two in the lower. Originally, four lower airbrakes were used, but the outboard two were deleted before the aircraft entered service. A brake parachute was installed inside the tail cone.

===Electrical and hydraulic systems===
The main electrical system on the B.1/B.1A was 112 V DC supplied by four 22.5kW engine-driven starter-generators. Backup power was provided by four 24 V 40 Ah batteries connected in series providing 96 V. Secondary electrical systems were 28 V DC, single-phase 115 V AC at 1600 Hz, and three-phase 115 V AC at 400 Hz, driven by transformers and inverters from the main system. The 28 V DC system was backed up by a single 24 V battery.

For greater efficiency and higher reliability, the main system on the B.2 was changed to three-phase 200 V AC at 400 Hz supplied by four 40 kVA engine-driven constant-speed alternators. Engine starting was then by air-starters supplied from a Palouste compressor on the ground. Standby supplies in the event of a main AC failure were provided by a ram air turbine driving a 17 kVA alternator that could operate from high altitudes down to , and an airborne auxiliary power plant, a Rover gas turbine driving a 40kVA alternator, which could be started once the aircraft was below an altitude of . Secondary electrical supplies were by transformer-rectifier units for 28 V DC and rotary frequency converters for the 115 V 1600 Hz single-phase supplies.

The change to an AC system was a significant improvement. Each PFCU had a hydraulic pump that was driven by an electric motor, in modern terminology, this is an electro-hydraulic actuator. Because no manual reversion existed, a total electrical failure would result in a loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time, but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.

The main hydraulic system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and bogie trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheel brakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. Hydraulic pressure was provided by three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated hydraulic power pack (EHPP) could be used to operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake accumulators. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.

===Engine===

The Rolls-Royce Olympus, originally known as the &quot;Bristol BE.10 Olympus&quot;, is a two-spool, axial-flow turbojet that powered the Vulcan. Each Vulcan had four engines buried in the wings, positioned in pairs close to the fuselage. The engine&#x27;s design began in 1947, intended to power the Bristol Aeroplane Company&#x27;s own rival design to the Vulcan.

As the prototype Vulcan VX770 was ready for flight prior to the Olympus being available, it first flew using Rolls-Royce Avon RA.3 engines of thrust. These were quickly replaced by Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire ASSa.6 engines of thrust. VX770 later became a flying test bed for the Rolls-Royce Conway. The second prototype VX777 first flew with Olympus 100s of thrust. It was subsequently re-engined with Olympus 101 engines. When VX777 flew with a Phase 2C (B.2) wing in 1957, it was fitted with Olympus 102 engines of thrust.

Early B.1s were equipped with the Olympus 101. Later aircraft were delivered with Olympus 102s. All Olympus 102s became the Olympus 104 on overhaul and ultimately thrust on uprating. The first B.2 flew with the second-generation Olympus 200, design of which began in 1952. Subsequent B.2s were engined with either the uprated Olympus 201 or the Olympus 301. The Olympus 201 was designated 202 on being fitted with a rapid air starter. The engine would later be developed into a reheated (afterburning) powerplant for the cancelled TSR-2 strike/reconnaissance aircraft and the supersonic passenger transport Concorde.

Around 90% power, the engines in the Vulcan would emit a distinctive &quot;howl&quot;-like noise due to the air intake arrangement, which became an attraction at public airshows.

==Operational history==
===Introduction===
In September 1956, the RAF received its first Vulcan B.1, XA897, which immediately embarked upon a round-the-world tour. The tour was to be an important demonstration of the range and capabilities of the aircraft, but it also had other benefits in the form of conducting goodwill visits in various countries; during their service, Vulcans routinely visited various nations and distant parts of the Commonwealth as a show of support and military protection. This first tour, however, was struck by misfortune; on 1 October 1956, while landing in bad weather at London Heathrow Airport at the completion of the world tour, XA897 was destroyed in a fatal accident.

The first two aircraft were delivered to 230 OCU in January 1957 and the training of crews started on 21 February 1957. The first OCU course to qualify was No. 1 Course, on 21 May 1957, and they went on to form the first flight of No. 83 Squadron. No. 83 Squadron was the first operational squadron to use the bomber, at first using borrowed Vulcans from the OCU, and on 11 July 1956 it received the first aircraft of its own. By September 1957, several Vulcans had been handed over to No. 83 Squadron. The second OCU course also formed a Flight of 83 Squadron, but subsequent trained crews were also used to form the second bomber squadron, 101 Squadron. The last aircraft from the first batch of 25 aircraft had been delivered by the end of 1957 to 101 Squadron.

To increase the mission range and flight time for Vulcan operations, in-flight refuelling capabilities were added from 1959 onwards; several Valiant bombers were refurbished as tankers to refuel the Vulcans. Continuous airborne patrols proved untenable, however, and the refuelling mechanisms across the Vulcan fleet fell into disuse in the 1960s. Both Vulcans and the other V-force aircraft routinely visited the Far East, in particular Singapore, where a fully equipped nuclear-weapons storage facility had been constructed in 1959. These deployments were part of the UK&#x27;s contribution to SEATO operations, often to test the defences of friendly nations in joint exercises. During the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, Britain planned to deploy three squadrons of V-bomber aircraft and 48 Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons to the region, although this was ultimately decided against. Vulcans trained in the region for both conventional and nuclear missions. In the early 1970s, the RAF decided to permanently deploy two squadrons of Vulcans overseas in the Near East Air Force Bomber Wing, based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. The Vulcans were withdrawn in the mid-1970s, however, as Cypriot intercommunal violence intensified.

Vulcans flew some very long-range missions. In June 1961, one flew 18,507 km from RAF Scampton to Sydney in just over 20 hours, facilitated by three air refuellings. Vulcans frequently visited the United States during the 1960s and 1970s to participate in air shows and static displays, as well as to participate in the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s (SAC) Annual Bombing and Navigation Competition at such locations as Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, and the former McCoy AFB, Florida. Vulcans also took part Operation Skyshield exercises in 1960, 1961, and 1962, in which NORAD defences were tested against possible Soviet air attack, the Vulcans simulating Soviet fighter/bomber attacks against New York, Chicago, and Washington, DC. The results of the tests were classified until 1997. The Vulcan proved quite successful during the 1974 &quot;Giant Voice&quot; exercise, in which it managed to avoid USAF interceptors.

===Nuclear deterrent===
As part of Britain&#x27;s independent nuclear deterrent, the Vulcan initially carried Britain&#x27;s first nuclear weapon, the &quot;Blue Danube&quot; gravity bomb. &quot;Blue Danube&quot; was a low-kiloton yield fission bomb designed before the United States detonated the first hydrogen bomb. These were supplemented by U.S.-owned &quot;Mk 5&quot; bombs (made available under the Project E programme) and later by the British &quot;Red Beard&quot; tactical nuclear weapon. The UK had already embarked on its own hydrogen bomb programme, and to bridge the gap until these were ready the V-bombers were equipped with an Interim Megaton Weapon based on the &quot;Blue Danube&quot; casing containing &quot;Green Grass&quot;, a large pure-fission warhead of yield. This bomb was known as &quot;Violet Club&quot;. Only five were deployed before the &quot;Green Grass&quot; warhead was incorporated into a developed weapon as &quot;Yellow Sun Mk.1.&quot;

The later &quot;Yellow Sun Mk 2&quot;, was fitted with &quot;Red Snow&quot;, a British-built variant of the U.S. W28 warhead. &quot;Yellow Sun Mk 2&quot; was the first British thermonuclear weapon to be deployed, and was carried on both the Vulcan and Handley Page Victor. The Valiant retained U.S. nuclear weapons assigned to SACEUR under the dual-key arrangements. &quot;Red Beard&quot; was positioned in Singapore for use by Vulcan and Victor bombers. From 1962, three squadrons of Vulcan B.2s and two squadrons of Victor B.2s were armed with the &quot;Blue Steel&quot; missile, a rocket-powered stand-off bomb, which was also fitted with the yield &quot;Red Snow&quot; warhead.

Operationally, RAF Bomber Command and the SAC cooperated in the Single Integrated Operational Plan to ensure coverage of all major Soviet targets from 1958; 108 of the RAF&#x27;s V-bombers were assigned targets under the plan by the end of 1959. From 1962 onwards, two jets in every RAF bomber base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle of Quick Reaction Alert (QRA). Vulcans on QRA were to be airborne within four minutes of receiving an alert, as this was identified as the amount of time between warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain. The closest the Vulcan came to taking part in potential nuclear conflict was during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, where Bomber Command was moved to Alert Condition 3, an increased state of preparedness from normal operations; however, it stood down in early November.

The Vulcans were intended to be equipped with the Skybolt missile to replace the Blue Steel, with Vulcan B.2s carrying two Skybolts under the wings. The last 28 B.2s were modified on the production line to fit pylons to carry the Skybolt. A B.3 variant with increased wingspan to carry up to six Skybolts was proposed in 1960. When the Skybolt missile system was cancelled by U.S. President John F. Kennedy on the recommendation of his Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara in 1962, precipitating the Skybolt Crisis, &quot;Blue Steel&quot; was retained. To supplement it until the Royal Navy took on the deterrent role with Polaris SLBM-equipped submarines, the Vulcan bombers adopted a new mission profile of flying high during clear transit, dropping down low to avoid enemy defences on approach, and deploying a parachute-retarded bomb, the WE.177B. However, since the aircraft had been designed for high-altitude flight, at low altitudes it could not exceed 350 knots. RAF Air Vice Marshal Ron Dick, a former Vulcan pilot, said &quot;it is [thus] questionable whether it could have been effective flying at low level in a war against ... the Soviet Union.&quot;

After the British Polaris submarines became operational and Blue Steel was taken out of service in 1970, the Vulcan continued to carry WE.177B in a tactical nuclear strike role as part of the British contribution to Europe&#x27;s standing NATO forces, although they no longer held aircraft at 15 minutes&#x27; readiness in peacetime. Two squadrons were also stationed in Cyprus as part of the Near East Air Force and assigned to Central Treaty Organization in a strategic strike role. With the eventual demise of the WE.177B and the Vulcan bombers, the Blackburn Buccaneer, SEPECAT Jaguar, and Panavia Tornado continued with the WE.177C until its retirement in 1998. While not a like-for-like replacement, the multi-role Tornado interdictor/strike bomber is the successor for the roles previously filled by the Vulcan.

===Conventional role===


Although in operational use the Vulcan typically carried various nuclear armaments, the type also had a secondary conventional role. While performing conventional combat missions, the Vulcan could carry up to 21  bombs inside its bomb bay. From the 1960s, the various Vulcan squadrons routinely conducted conventional training missions; the aircrews were expected to be able to perform conventional bombing missions, in addition to the critical nuclear strike mission.

The Vulcan&#x27;s only combat missions took place towards the end of the type&#x27;s service in 1982. During the Falklands War, the Vulcan was deployed against Argentinian forces which had occupied the Falkland Islands. The missions performed by the Vulcan became known as the &quot;Black Buck&quot; raids, each aircraft had to fly from Ascension Island to reach Stanley on the Falklands. Victor tankers conducted the necessary air-to-air refuelling for the Vulcan to cover the distance involved; approximately of fuel was used in each mission.

Engineering work to prepare the five Vulcans that would conduct the missions began on 9 April. Each aircraft required modifications to the bomb bay, the reinstatement of the long out-of-use in-flight refuelling system, the installation of a new navigational system derived from the Vickers VC10, and the updating of several onboard electronics. Underneath the wings, new pylons were fitted to carry an ECM pod and Shrike antiradar missiles at wing hardpoint locations.

On 1 May, the first mission was conducted by a single Vulcan (XM607) that flew over Port Stanley and dropped its bombs on the airfield, concentrating on the single runway, with one direct hit, making it unsuitable for fighter aircraft. The Vulcan&#x27;s mission was quickly followed up by strikes against anti-air installations, flown by British Aerospace Sea Harriers from Royal Navy aircraft carriers. A further two missions saw missiles launched against radar installations and two additional missions were cancelled. At the time, these missions held the record for the world&#x27;s longest-distance raids. The Vulcans&#x27; ECM systems proved to be effective at jamming Argentine radars; while a Vulcan was within the theatre, other British aircraft in the vicinity had a reduced chance of coming under effective fire.

On 3 June 1982, Vulcan B.2 XM597 of No. 50 Squadron took part in the &quot;Black Buck 6&quot; mission against Argentinian radar sites at Stanley airfield on the Falkland Islands. While attempting to refuel for its return journey to Ascension Island, the probe broke, leaving the Vulcan with insufficient fuel, forcing a diversion to Galeão Air Force Base, Rio de Janeiro, in neutral Brazil. En route, secret papers were dumped along with the two remaining AGM-45 Shrike missiles, although one failed to launch. After a mayday call, the Vulcan, escorted by Brazilian Air Force Northrop F-5 fighters, was permitted an emergency landing at Rio with very little fuel left on board. The Vulcan and her crew were detained until the end of hostilities nine days later.

===Reconnaissance===
In November 1973, as a result of the planned closure of the Victor SR.2 equipped No. 543 Squadron, No. 27 Squadron reformed at RAF Scampton equipped with the Vulcan as a replacement in the maritime radar reconnaissance role. The squadron carried out patrols of the seas around the British Isles, including the strategically important GIUK gap between Iceland and the United Kingdom, flying at high level and using the Vulcan&#x27;s H2S radar to monitor shipping. In peacetime, this could be followed up by visual identification and photography of targets of interest at low level. In the event of war, a Vulcan would leave visual identification of potential targets to Buccaneers or Canberras and could coordinate attacks by Buccaneers against hostile shipping. Though initially equipped with a number of B.2 aircraft, the Squadron eventually operated nine B.2 (MRR) aircraft (also known by the unofficial designation SR.2). The aircraft were modified for the role by removing the TFR (and its thimble radome) and adding the LORAN C radio navigation aid. The main external visual difference was the presence of a gloss paint finish, with a light grey undersurface, to protect against sea spray.

The squadron also inherited its secondary role of air sampling from No. 543 Squadron. This involved flying through plumes of airborne contamination and using onboard equipment to collect fallout released from both above ground and underground nuclear tests for later analysis at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston. Five aircraft had small pylons fitted to the redundant Skybolt hardpoints, which could be used to carry sampling pods modified from drop tanks. These pods would collect the needed samples on a filter, while an additional smaller &quot;localiser&quot; pod was fitted to the port wing, inboard of the main pylons.

The squadron disbanded at Scampton in March 1982, passing on its radar reconnaissance duties to the RAF&#x27;s Nimrods.

===Aerial refuelling role===
After the end of the Falklands War in 1982, the Vulcan B.2 was due to be withdrawn from RAF service that year. The Falklands campaign, however, had consumed much of the airframe fatigue life of the RAF&#x27;s Victor tankers. While Vickers VC10 tanker conversions had been ordered in 1979 and Lockheed TriStar tankers would be ordered after the conflict, as a stopgap measure six Vulcans were converted into single-point tankers. The Vulcan tanker conversion was accomplished by removing the jammers from the ECM bay in the tail of the aircraft and replacing them with a single hose drum unit. An additional cylindrical bomb-bay tank was fitted, giving a fuel capacity of almost .

The go-ahead for converting the six aircraft was given on 4 May 1982. Just 50 days after being ordered, the first Vulcan tanker, &quot;XH561&quot;, was delivered to RAF Waddington. The Vulcan K.2s were operated by No. 50 Squadron, along with three Vulcan B.2s, in support of UK air defence activities until it was disbanded in March 1984.

===Vulcan Display Flight===
After the disbandment of No. 50 Squadron, two Vulcans continued flying with the RAF in air displays as part of the Vulcan Display Flight, based at Waddington but administered through No. 55 Squadron, based at RAF Marham. Initially displaying using XL426, in 1986 that aircraft was sold, having been replaced by XH558, which began displays in 1985. The VDF continued with XH558 until 1992, finishing operations after the Ministry of Defence determined it was too costly to run in light of budget cuts. Both aircraft subsequently entered preservation and survived, although a third, XH560, kept in reserve in the first years, was later scrapped.

===Engine test beds===
* The first prototype VX770 had its Sapphire engines replaced with four Rolls-Royce Conway RCo.7 turbofans in 1957. It was transferred to Rolls-Royce as the Conway test bed. It flew with the Conways, the first turbofans in the world, until its fatal crash in September 1958.
* The first Vulcan B.1 XA889 was used for the flight clearances of the Olympus 102 and 104.
* Vulcan B.1 XA891 was fitted with four Olympus 200 engines in the spring of 1958 for intensive flying trials. The aircraft crashed in July 1958 during a routine test flight.
* Vulcan B.1 XA894 flew with five Olympus engines, the standard four Mk.101s, plus a reheated Olympus 320 destined for the BAC TSR-2 in an underslung nacelle. This aircraft was destroyed in a ground fire at Filton on 3 December 1962.
* Vulcan B.1 XA896 was withdrawn from RAF service in June 1964 and transferred to be converted to the test bed for the Bristol Siddeley BS100 vectored thrust turbofan for the Hawker Siddeley P.1154. The P.1154 was cancelled in February 1965 and XA896 was scrapped before being converted.
* Vulcan B.1 XA902 was withdrawn from RAF service after a landing accident in 1958. After rebuilding, it replaced VX770 as the Conway test bed, fitted with four RCo.11s. The two inner Conways were replaced with Rolls-Royce Speys, flying for the first time in this configuration on 12 October 1961.
* Vulcan B.1 XA903, surplus to Blue Steel trials, was converted to a similar layout to XA894 to flight test the Olympus 593 Concorde installation. The first flight was on 1 October 1966 and testing continued through to June 1971. In April 1973, XA903 started flying with an underslung Rolls-Royce RB.199 turbofan destined for the Panavia Tornado. XA903 was the last B.1 to fly, being retired in February 1979.
* Vulcan B.2 XH557 was used by BSEL for developing the Olympus 301 and first flew with the larger engine in May 1961. It was returned to Woodford in 1964 to be refurbished for the RAF.

==Variants==
;B.1
:The initial production aircraft. The first few had straight leading edges, later retrofitted with phase 2 (kinked) wings. Early examples were finished in silver, later changed to &quot;anti-flash&quot; white. Many were converted to B.1A standard 1959–1963. The last few unmodified B.1s in RAF service with No. 230 OCU retired by 1966. Last flight by any B.1, an engine testbed XA903, March 1979.

;B.1A

===V-Bomber dispersal airfields===
In the event of transition to war, the V Bomber squadrons were to deploy four aircraft at short notice to each of 26 pre-prepared dispersal airfields around the United Kingdom. In the early 1960s the RAF ordered 20 Beagle Basset communication aircraft to move the crews to dispersal airfields; the importance of these aircraft was only brief, diminishing when the primary nuclear deterrent switched to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Polaris (UK nuclear programme).

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 1 October 1956, Vulcan B.1 XA897, the first to be delivered, crashed at London Heathrow Airport during Operation Tasman Flight, a flag-waving trip to Australia and New Zealand. After a ground-controlled approach in bad weather, it struck the ground short of the runway just as engine power was applied. The impact probably broke the drag links on the main undercarriage, allowing the undercarriage to be forced backwards and damaged the wing&#x27;s trailing edge. After the initial impact, XA897 rose back in the air. The pilot, Squadron Leader D. R. Howard, and co-pilot Air Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst, AOC-in-C Bomber Command, both ejected and survived, the other four occupants (including a spare pilot and an Avro representative) were killed when the aircraft hit the ground again and broke up.
* In 1957, a Vulcan B.1 XA892 attached to the A&amp;AEE at Boscombe Down for acceptance testing was unintentionally flown to an indicated Mach number (IMN) above 1.04, alerting the crew that it had reached supersonic speed. XA892&#x27;s commander, Flt Lt Milt Cottee (RAAF), and co-pilot, Flt Lt Ray Bray (RAF), were tasked to fly at and 0.98 IMN, taking the aircraft to a load factor of 3 &quot;g&quot;. It climbed to and then dived, intending to reach the target speed at . Approaching the target altitude, the throttles were closed and full up-elevator applied, but XA892 continued to pitch nose-down. Cottee contemplated pushing forward to go inverted and then rolling upright; instead, he opened the speed brakes. Although the airspeed was above their maximum operating speed, the speed brakes were undamaged and did slow the aircraft, which came back past the vertical at about and levelled off at . No sonic boom was reported, so a true Mach number of 1.0 was unlikely to have been reached. Afterwards, a rear bulkhead was found to be deformed.

* On 20 September 1958, prototype Vulcan VX770 was flown by a Rolls-Royce test pilot on an engine-performance sortie with a flypast at RAF Syerston Battle of Britain &quot;At Home&quot; display. It flew along the main runway then started a roll to starboard and climbed slightly, during which the starboard wing disintegrated and the main spar collapsed. VX770 went into a dive with the starboard wing on fire and struck the ground, killing three occupants of a controllers&#x27; caravan and all four crew on board. Proposed causes of the structural failure have included pilot error, metal fatigue due to air intake vibration, and inadequate maintenance.
* On 24 October 1958, Vulcan B.1 XA908 of No. 83 Squadron crashed east of Detroit, Michigan, USA. A complete electrical failure occurred around . The backup system should have provided 20 minutes of emergency power, allowing XA908 to reach one of several airports in the area, but backup power lasted only three minutes due to a short circuit in the service busbar, locking the controls. Bound for Lincoln AFB in Nebraska, XA908 went into a steep dive before crashing, leaving a crater in the ground, which was later excavated while retrieving wreckage. Despite extensive property damage, there were no ground fatalities and only one hospitalisation. All six crew members were killed, including the co-pilot, who had ejected. The co-pilot&#x27;s ejection seat was found in Lake St Clair, but his body was not recovered until the following spring. They were buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Trenton, Michigan, alongside 11 RAF student pilots killed during the Second World War in accidents at nearby Naval Air Station Grosse Ile.
* On 24 July 1959, Vulcan B.1 XA891 crashed due to an electrical failure during an engine test. Shortly after takeoff, the crew observed generator warning lights and loss of busbar voltage. The aircraft commander, Avro Chief Test Pilot Jimmy Harrison, climbed XA891 to , steering away from the airfield and populated areas, while the AEO attempted to solve the problem. When it became clear that control would not be regained, Harrison instructed the rear compartment crew to exit the aircraft and the co-pilot to eject, before ejecting himself. All the crew survived, making them the first complete Vulcan crew to successfully escape. The aircraft crashed near Kingston upon Hull.
* On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 participated in an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, formerly Rongotai Airport. After a &quot;touch-and-go landing&quot; on Runway 34, it came around for a full-stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold. The port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines, and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before it was able to lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.
* On 16 September 1960, Vulcan B.2 XH557 damaged the &quot;Runway Garage&quot; at Filton. XH557 had been allocated to Bristol Siddeley Engines to test the Olympus 301 engine and was being delivered to Filton. Approaching in poor weather conditions, the aircraft touched down halfway along the runway. The braking parachute was streamed, but realising the aircraft would not stop in time, the captain opened the throttles to go round. The Runway Garage took the full force of the jet blast and property damage was sustained; four petrol pumps were blown flat, a streetlight on the A38 was knocked down, railings were blown over, and multiple cars had their windscreens shattered. The aircraft diverted to St. Mawgan, flying into Filton days later.
* On 12 June 1963, Vulcan B.1A XH477 of No. 50 Squadron crashed in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. During a low-level exercise, the Vulcan was flown into terrain. All five crewmembers were killed.
* On 11 May 1964, Vulcan B.2 XH535 crashed during a demonstration. The aircraft entered a spin while a very low speed and high rate of descent were being demonstrated. The landing parachute was deployed, stopping the spin briefly before it began to spin again. Around , the aircraft commander instructed the crew to abandon the aircraft. The commander and co-pilot ejected successfully, but none of the rear compartment crew did so, presumably due to the &quot;g&quot; forces in the spin.
* On 16 July 1964, Vulcan B.1A XA909 crashed in Anglesey after a midair explosion caused both No. 3 and No. 4 engines to be shut down. The explosion was caused by the failure of a bearing in No. 4 engine. The starboard wing was extensively damaged, the pilot had insufficient aileron power, and both airspeed indications were highly inaccurate. The whole crew successfully abandoned XA909 and was found within a few minutes and rescued.
* On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during an overshoot from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby. The co-pilot had executed the asymmetric power approach with two engines producing thrust and two at idle. He was being checked by the squadron commander, who was unfamiliar with the aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot, the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. The engines that had been producing power reached full power more quickly than the engines at idle and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash. All the crew perished.
* On 25 May 1965, Vulcan B.2 XM576 crash-landed at Scampton, causing it to be written off within a year of delivery.
* On 11 February 1966, Vulcan B.2 XH536 of IX SQN Cottesmore Wing crashed in the Brecon Beacons during a low-level exercise. The aircraft struck the ground at near the summit of Fan Bwlch Chwyth , northeast of Swansea. All crew members died. Hilltops at the time were snow-covered and cloud extended down to .
* On 6 April 1967, Vulcan B.2 XL385 burnt out on the runway at RAF Scampton at the beginning of its take-off run. The aircraft was carrying a Blue Steel missile training round. All the crew, including an Air Training Corps cadet, escaped unhurt. The aircraft was engulfed in flames and totally destroyed. The accident was caused by the failure of an Olympus 301 HP turbine disc as the engine reached full power.
* On 30 January 1968, Vulcan B.2 XM604 crashed following a loss of control during an overshoot at RAF Cottesmore. The rear crew members were killed, though both pilots ejected. The captain ejected at a very late stage and only survived because his deploying parachute was snagged by some power cables. The accident was caused by the failure of an Olympus 301 LP turbine disc after the aircraft had returned to the airfield following indications of a bomb-bay overheat.
* On 7 January 1971, Vulcan B.2 XM610 of No.44 Squadron crashed due to a blade fatigue failure in the No. 1 engine, damaging the fuel system and causing a fire. The crew abandoned the aircraft safely, after which it crashed harmlessly in Wingate.
* On 14 October 1975, Vulcan B.2 XM645 of No.9 Squadron lost its left undercarriage and damaged the airframe when it undershot the runway at RAF Luqa in Malta. The aircraft broke up over the town of Żabbar while turning inbound for an emergency landing. The pilot and co-pilot escaped using their ejection seats, the other five crew members were killed. Large aircraft pieces fell on the town; one woman, Vincenza Zammit, was killed by an electric cable, and some 20 others were injured.
* On 17 January 1977, Vulcan B.2 XM600 of No. 101 Squadron crashed near Spilsby, Lincolnshire. During a practice emergency descent, the bomb-bay fire warning light flashed on followed by No.2 engine fire warning light. The captain shut the engine down and the AEO reported flames coming from the area of No.2 engine, just behind the deployed ram air turbine (RAT). As the fire intensified, the captain ordered the aircraft to be abandoned. The three rear crew members escaped around . After ordering the co-pilot to eject, the captain ejected at around , as control was lost. The cause was due to arcing on the RAT&#x27;s electrical terminals, burning a hole in an adjacent fuel pipe and setting the fuel on fire.
* On 12 August 1978, Vulcan B.2 XL390 of No. 617 Squadron crashed during an air display at Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois, in the United States. The crew had been authorized to carry out a display at Chicago&#x27;s Meigs Field airport; the captain had elected to carry out an unauthorized display at Glenview beforehand. After a low-level run, probably below , the aircraft pulled up for an improperly executed wingover, resulting in a low-level stall and crash, killing all on board.
* On 3 June 1982, Vulcan XM597 broke its probe while attempting to refuel in flight, while returning from a mission over the Falkland Islands. With insufficient fuel to reach its base on Ascension Island, the pilot discarded classified information over the Atlantic Ocean and diverted to Rio de Janeiro. Shortly after entering Brazilian airspace, the Brazilian Air Force sent two Northrop F-5s to escort it to Galeão Air Force Base. This led to high-level diplomatic talks between the UK and Brazil, which remained neutral during the Falklands War. After seven days of detention, the Vulcan and its crew were allowed to return home on the condition that XM597 play no further part in the conflict.
* On 28 May 2012, Vulcan B.2 XH558 suffered a failure of the two port engines while starting a take-off roll from Robin Hood Airport, Doncaster. Bags of silica gel desiccant had been inadvertently left in the air intake after maintenance. Less than a second after increasing power from 80% to 100%, these were ingested by one of the port engines, immediately destroying it. The remaining port engine ingested debris from the first engine, destroying this one, as well. The fire-prevention systems proved effective, neither the airframe nor control systems suffered damage. The pilot had no difficulty bringing the aircraft to a safe stop, having remained on the ground throughout. On 3 July 2012, XH558 returned to flight.

==Surviving aircraft==

Several Vulcans survive, housed in museums in both the United Kingdom and North America (USA and Canada). One Vulcan, XH558 (G-VLCN) &quot;Spirit of Great Britain&quot;, was used as a display aircraft by the RAF as part of the Vulcan Display Flight until 1993. After being grounded, it was later restored to flight by the Vulcan To The Sky Trust and displayed as a civilian aircraft from 2008 until 2015, before being retired a second time for engineering reasons. In retirement, XH558 is to be retained at its base at Doncaster Sheffield Airport as a taxiable aircraft, a role already performed by two other survivors, XL426 (G-VJET) based at Southend Airport, and XM655 (G-VULC), based at Wellesbourne Mountford Airfield. XJ823, a B.2, can be seen at the Solway Aviation Museum at Carlisle Lake District Airport. XM607 is currently being restored at RAF Waddington, where it has been gate guardian since being retired. XM594 is on display at the Newark Air Museum, Newark, Nottinghamshire, England.

<text>The M61 Vulcan is a hydraulically, electrically, or pneumatically driven, six-barrel, air-cooled, electrically fired Gatling-style rotary cannon which fires  rounds at an extremely high rate (typically 6,000 rounds per minute). The M61 and its derivatives have been the principal cannon armament of United States military fixed-wing aircraft for over sixty years.

The M61 was originally produced by General Electric. After several mergers and acquisitions, it is produced by General Dynamics .

==Development==
At the end of World War II, the United States Army Air Forces began to consider new directions for future military aircraft guns. The higher speeds of jet-powered fighter aircraft meant that achieving an effective number of hits would be extremely difficult without a much higher volume of fire. While captured German designs (principally the Mauser MG 213C) showed the potential of the single-barrel revolver cannon, the practical rate of fire of such a design was still limited by ammunition feed and barrel wear concerns. The Army wanted something better, combining an extremely high rate of fire with exceptional reliability. 

In 1947, the Air Force became a separate branch of the military. The new Air Force made a request for a new aircraft gun. A lesson of World War II air combat was that German, Italian, and Japanese fighters could attack American aircraft from long range with their cannon main armament. American fighters with .50 caliber (12.7 mm) main armament, such as the P-51 and P-47, had to be close to enemy aircraft in order to hit and damage them. The Hispano cannon carried by the P-38 and P-61, while formidable against propeller-driven planes, had a relatively low rate of fire in the age of jets, while other cannons were notoriously unreliable.

In response to this requirement, the Armament Division of General Electric resurrected an old idea: the multi-barrel Gatling gun. The original Gatling gun had fallen out of favor because of the need for an external power source to rotate the barrel assembly, but the new generation of turbojet-powered fighters offered sufficient electric power to operate the gun, and electric operation was more reliable than gas-operated reloading. 

With multiple barrels, the rate of fire per barrel could be lower than a single-barrel revolver cannon while providing a greater overall rate of fire. The idea of powering a Gatling gun from an external electric power source was not a novel idea at the end of World War II, as Richard Jordan Gatling himself had done just that with a patent he filed in 1893. 

During World War I, a similar 12-barreled Fokker-Leimberger aircraft rotary machine gun, powered by either the aircraft engine or an electric motor, had been under development by the German Empire.

In 1946, the Army issued General Electric a contract for &quot;Project Vulcan&quot;, a six-barrel weapon capable of firing 7,200 rounds per minute (rpm). Although European designers were moving towards heavier weapons for better hitting power, the U.S. initially concentrated on a powerful cartridge designed for a pre-war anti-tank rifle, expecting that the cartridge&#x27;s high muzzle velocity would be beneficial for improving hit ratios on high-speed targets. The first GE prototypes of the caliber T45 were ground-fired in 1949; it achieved 2,500 rpm, which was increased to 4,000 rpm by 1950. By the early 1950s, the USAF decided that high velocity alone might not be sufficient to ensure target destruction and tested alternatives based on the caliber cartridge. These variants of the T45 were known as the T171 and T150 respectively and were first tested in 1952. Eventually, the standard 20×102 mm cartridge was determined to have the desired balance of projectile/explosive mass and muzzle velocity, resulting in an optimum balance of range, accuracy and kinetic energy on target.

The development of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter revealed that the T171 Vulcan (later redesignated &quot;M61&quot;) suffered problems with its linked ammunition, being prone to misfeed and presenting a foreign object damage hazard with discarded links. A linkless ammunition feed system was developed for the upgraded &quot;M61A1&quot;, which subsequently became the standard cannon armament of U.S. fighters.

In 1993, General Electric sold its aerospace division, including GE Armament Systems along with the design and production tooling for the M61 and GE&#x27;s other rotary cannon, to Martin Marietta. After Martin&#x27;s merger with Lockheed, the rotary cannon became the responsibility of Lockheed Martin Armament Systems. Lockheed Martin Armament Systems was later acquired by General Dynamics, which produces the M61 and its variants .

==Description==
Each of the cannon&#x27;s six barrels fires once in turn during each revolution of the barrel cluster. The multiple barrels provide both a very high rate of fire—around 100 rounds per second—and contribute to prolonged weapon life by minimizing barrel erosion and heat generation. The average time between jams or failures is in excess of 10,000 rounds, making it an extremely reliable weapon. The success of the Vulcan Project and its progeny, the very-high-speed Gatling gun, has led to guns of the same configuration being referred to as , which can sometimes confuse nomenclature on the subject.

Most aircraft versions of the M61 are hydraulically driven and electrically primed. The gun rotor, barrel assembly and ammunition feed system are rotated by a hydraulic drive motor through a system of flexible drive shafts. The round is fired by an electric priming system where an electric current from a firing lead passes through the firing pin to the primer as each round is rotated into the firing position.

The self-powered version, the GAU-4 (called M130 in Army service), is gas-operated, tapping gun gas from three of the six barrels to operate the gun gas-driven mechanism. The self-powered Vulcan weighs about more than its electric counterpart, but requires no external power source to operate, except for an electric inertia starter to initiate gun rotation, allowing the first rounds to be chambered and fired.

The initial M61 used linked ammunition, but the ejection of spent links created considerable (and ultimately insuperable) problems. The original weapon was soon replaced by the M61A1, with a linkless feed system. Depending on the application, the feed system can be either single-ended (ejecting spent cases and unfired rounds) or double-ended (returning casings back to the magazine). A disadvantage of the M61 is that the bulk of the weapon, its feed system, and ammunition drum make it difficult to fit it into a densely packed airframe.

The feed system must be custom-designed for each application, adding to the complete weapon. Most aircraft installations are double-ended, because the ejection of empty cartridges can cause a foreign-object damage hazard for jet engines and because the retention of spent cases assists in maintaining the center of gravity of the aircraft. The first aircraft to carry the M61A1 was the C model of the F-104, starting in 1959.

A lighter version of the Vulcan developed for use on the F-22 Raptor, designated M61A2, is mechanically the same as the M61A1, but with thinner barrels to reduce overall weight to . The rotor and housing have also been modified to remove any piece of metal not absolutely needed for operation and replaces some metal components with lighter-weight materials. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet also uses this version.

The Vulcan&#x27;s rate of fire is typically 6,000 rounds per minute, although some versions (such as that of the AMX and the F-106 Delta Dart) are limited to a lower rate, and others (A-7 Corsair, F-15 Eagle) have a selectable rate of fire of either 4,000 or 6,000 rounds per minute. The M61A2&#x27;s lighter barrels allow a somewhat higher rate of fire, up to 6,600 rounds per minute.

===Ammunition===
Practically no powered rotary cannon is supplied with sufficient ammunition for a full minute of firing, due to its weight (at 6,000 rpm, the projectiles alone would represent a mass of about for one minute of firing; and by including the brass shell, filling and primer the weight is slightly double that at ). In order to avoid using the 600 to 1,000 rounds carried by aircraft all at once, a burst controller is generally used to limit the number of rounds fired at each trigger pull. Bursts of from two or three up to 40 or 50 can be selected. The size of the airframe and available internal space limits the size of the ammunition drum and thus limits the ammunition capacity. When vehicle-mounted, the only limiting factor is the vehicle&#x27;s safe carry weight, so commensurately larger ammo storage is available.

Until the late 1980s, the M61 primarily used the M50 series of ammunition in various types, typically firing a projectile at a muzzle velocity of about . A variety of armor-piercing incendiary (API), high-explosive incendiary (HEI), and training rounds are available.

A new PGU-28/B round was developed in the mid-1980s. It is a semi-armor-piercing high-explosive incendiary (SAPHEI) round, providing improvements in range, accuracy, and power over the preceding M56A3 HEI round. The PGU-28/B is a &quot;low-drag&quot; round designed to reduce in-flight drag and deceleration, and has a slightly increased muzzle velocity of . However, the PGU-28/B has not been without problems. A 2000 USAF safety report noted 24 premature detonation mishaps (causing serious damage in many cases) in 12 years with the SAPHEI round, compared to only two such mishaps in the entire recorded history of the M56 round. The report estimated that the PGU-28/B had a potential failure rate 80 times higher than USAF standards permit. Due to safety issues, it was limited to emergency wartime use in 2000.

The main types of combat rounds and their main characteristics are listed in the table:
==Applications and first combat use==
The Vulcan was first used in aerial combat on 4 April 1965, when four North Vietnamese Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF) MiG-17s) attacked a force of 10 North American F-100 Super Sabres (two of which were assigned weather reconnaissance duties) escorting 48 Vulcan-armed and &quot;bomb-laden&quot; F-105 Thunderchiefs, shooting down two of the latter. The MiG leader and only survivor from the four MiGs, Captain Tran Hanh, reported that U.S. jets had pursued them and that F-105s had shot down three of his aircraft, killing lieutenants Pham Giay, Le Minh Huan and Tran Nguyen Nam. Captain Donald Kilgus, piloting an F-100, received an official probable kill with his four M39 20 mm cannons during the engagement; however no other US pilot reported destroying any MiGs during the battle, leaving open the possibility that at least two of the MiG-17s may have been downed by their own anti-aircraft fire.

The first confirmed Vulcan gun kill occurred on 29 June 1966 when Major Fred Tracy, flying his F-105 with the 421st TFS, fired 200 rounds of 20 mm into a MiG-17 that had just fired a 23 mm shell which entered one side of his cockpit and exited the other. When the VPAF MiG flew in front of him after making its pass, Tracy opened fire on it.

The gun was installed in the Air Force&#x27;s A-7D version of the LTV A-7 Corsair II where it replaced the earlier United States Navy A-7&#x27;s Colt Mk 12 cannon and was adopted by the Navy on the A-7C and A-7E. It was integrated into the newer F-4E Phantom II variants. The F-4 was originally designed without a cannon as it was believed that missiles had made guns obsolete. Combat experience in Vietnam showed that a gun could be more effective than guided missiles in many combat situations and that an externally carried gun pod was less effective than an internal gun; the first generation of gun pods such as the SUU-16 were not oriented with the sights of the fighter. The improved pods were self-powered and properly synchronized to the sights, while the USAF versions of the F-4 were hastily fitted with internal M61 cannons in a prominent fairing under the nose, well before the war ended (Navy Phantoms never received cannons, continuing to rely on air-to-air missiles alone). The next generation of fighters built post-Vietnam incorporated the M61 gun internally.


The Vulcan was later fitted into the weapons bay of some Convair F-106 Delta Dart and General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark models. It was also adopted as standard in the &quot;teen&quot;-series air superiority fighters: the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. Other aircraft include the Italian/Brazilian AMX International AMX (on Italian aircraft only), and the F-22 Raptor. It was fitted in a side-firing installation on the Fairchild AC-119 and some marks of the Lockheed AC-130 gunships, and was used in the tail turrets of both the Convair B-58 Hustler and Boeing B-52H Stratofortress bombers. Japan&#x27;s Mitsubishi F-1 carried one internally mounted JM61A1 Vulcan with 750 rounds.

Two gun pod versions, the SUU-16/A (also designated M12 by the US Army) and improved SUU-23/A (US Army M25), were developed in the 1960s, often used on gunless versions of the F-4. The SUU-16/A uses the electric M61A1 with a ram-air turbine to power the motor. This proved to cause serious aerodynamic drag at higher speeds, while speeds under did not provide enough airflow for the maximum rate of fire.

The subsequent SUU-23/A uses the GAU-4/A self-powered Vulcan, with an electric inertia starter to bring it up to speed. Both pods ejected empty cases and unfired rounds rather than retaining them. Both pods contained 1,200 rounds of ammunition, with a loaded weight of respectively. During service in the Vietnam War, the pods proved to be relatively inaccurate: the pylon mounting was not rigid enough to prevent deflection when firing, and repeated use would misalign the pod on its pylon, making matters worse.

A variant with much shorter barrels, designated the M195, was also developed for use on the M35 Armament Subsystem as used on the AH-1G Cobra helicopter. This variant fed from ammunition boxes fitted to the landing skid and was developed to provide the AH-1 helicopter with a longer-range suppressive fire system before the adoption of the M97 universal turret mounting the M197 cannon.

The M61 is also the basis of the US Navy Mk 15 Phalanx close-in weapon system and the M163 VADS Vulcan Air Defense System, using the M168 variant.

On 13 December 2024, the Ukrainian Air Force claimed a F-16 shot down 6 Russian cruise missiles. Two were shot down with “medium-range missiles”, another two with “short-range missiles” and finally two with the M61 Vulcan 20 mm cannon. The pilot wasn’t identified for security reasons but said: &quot;A few bursts from the cannon — and an explosion... then another one! &#x27;A secondary detonation,&#x27; I thought, but, as it turned out, there were two missiles,&quot;

<text>Captains Courageous: A Story of the Grand Banks is an 1897 novel by Rudyard Kipling that follows the adventures of fifteen-year-old Harvey Cheyne Jr., the spoiled son of a railroad tycoon, after he is saved from drowning by a Portuguese fisherman in the North Atlantic. The novel originally appeared as a serialisation in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, beginning with the November 1896 edition with the last instalment appearing in May 1897. In that year, it was published in its entirety as a novel, first in the United States by , and a month later in the United Kingdom by . It is Kipling&#x27;s only novel set entirely in North America. In 1900, Teddy Roosevelt extolled the book in his essay &quot;What We Can Expect of the American Boy&quot;, praising Kipling for describing &quot;in the liveliest way just what a boy should be and do&quot;.

The book&#x27;s title comes from the ballad &quot;Mary Ambree&quot;, which starts, &quot;Then captains courageous, whom death could not daunt&quot;. Kipling had previously used the same title for an article on businessmen as the new adventurers, published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 23 November 1892.

==Plot==
Protagonist Harvey Cheyne Jr. is the spoiled son of a wealthy California railroad magnate. Washed overboard from a transatlantic steamship and rescued by the crew of the fishing schooner &quot;We&#x27;re Here&quot;, off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Harvey can neither persuade them to take him quickly to port, nor convince them of his wealth. Harvey accuses the captain, Disko Troop, of taking his money (which is revealed to be on the deck from which Harvey fell). Troop bloodies his nose, but takes him in as a boy on the crew until they return to port. Harvey comes to accept his situation.

Through a series of trials and adventures, Harvey, with the help of the captain&#x27;s son, Dan Troop, becomes acclimated to the fishing lifestyle, and even skillful, such as becoming responsible for the ship&#x27;s accounts of its catch. Great stories of the cod fishery with references to New England whaling and 19th-century steam and sailing are intertwined with the &quot;We&#x27;re Here&quot;&#x27;s adventures during a season at sea. Eventually, the &quot;We&#x27;re Here&quot; returns to port and Harvey wires his parents, who immediately hasten to Boston, Massachusetts, and thence to the fishing town of Gloucester to recover him. The Cheynes are amazed by their son&#x27;s newfound maturity, and reward the seaman Manuel, who initially rescued Harvey. Harvey&#x27;s father hires Dan to work on his prestigious tea clipper fleet, and Harvey goes to Stanford to prepare for taking over his father&#x27;s shipping lines.

==Notes==
The book was written during Kipling&#x27;s time living in Brattleboro, Vermont. Kipling recalled in his autobiography:

Kipling also recalled:

The resulting account, in Chapter 9, of the Cheynes&#x27; journey from San Diego to Boston, is a classic of railway literature. The couple travel in the Cheynes&#x27; private rail car, the &quot;Constance&quot;, and are taken from San Diego to Chicago as a special train, hauled by sixteen locomotives in succession. It takes precedence over 177 other trains. &quot;Two and one-half minutes would be allowed for changing engines; three for watering and two for coaling&quot;. The &quot;Constance&quot; is attached to the scheduled express &quot;New York Limited&quot; to Buffalo, New York, and transferred to the New York Central for the trip across the state to Albany. Switched to the Boston and Albany Railroad, the Cheynes complete the trip to Boston in their private car, with the entire cross-country run taking 87 hours 35 minutes.

Kipling also recalled:

Disko Troop claims to receive his given name for his birth on board his father&#x27;s ship near Disko Island on the west coast of Greenland. His crewman, &quot;Long Jack&quot;, once calls him &quot;Discobolus&quot;.

A claim that Kipling used the United States Fish Commission fisheries research ship as the model for &quot;We′re Here&quot; is unproven.

<text>Vice-Admiral John Byron (8 November 1723 – 1 April 1786) was a British Royal Navy officer and explorer. He earned the nickname &quot;Foul-Weather Jack&quot; in the press because of his frequent encounters with bad weather at sea. As a midshipman, he sailed in the squadron under George Anson on his voyage around the world, though Byron&#x27;s ship, HMS &quot;Wager&quot;, made it only to southern Chile, where it was wrecked. He returned to England with the captain of the ship. He was governor of Newfoundland following Hugh Palliser, who left in 1768. He circumnavigated the world as a commodore with his own squadron in 1764–1766. He fought in battles in the Seven Years&#x27; War and the American Revolution. He rose to Vice Admiral of the White before his death in 1786.

His grandsons include the poet Lord Byron and George Anson Byron, admiral and explorer, who were the 6th and 7th Baron Byron, respectively.

==Early career==
Byron was the second son of William Byron, 4th Baron Byron and Frances Berkeley, the daughter of William, 4th Baron Berkeley. After studying at Westminster School he joined the Royal Navy at the age of 14, making his first voyage aboard HMS &quot;Romney&quot; in 1738–40.

==Anson&#x27;s voyage around the world==
In 1740, he accompanied George Anson on his voyage around the world as a midshipman aboard one of the several ships in the squadron. 
On 14 May 1741, HMS &quot;Wager&quot; was shipwrecked on the coast of Chile on what is now called Wager Island and Byron was one of the survivors. Under the tenuous command of Captain David Cheape, who was only promoted to the position mid-voyage following the death of his predecessor, the survivors bickered amongst themselves and split into factions. A large group of sailors, including Byron, eventually defied Cheape&#x27;s authority and sailed east to Portuguese Brazil, targeting Rio Grande do Sul on the Atlantic coast. Days into the journey, Byron and several others returned to the Captain and his remaining small party. 

Cheape&#x27;s party consisted of 19 men after the deserters rejoined the camp. This included the surgeon Elliot and Lieutenant Hamilton, as well as Byron and fellow midshipman Alexander Campbell. They rowed up the coast but were punished by continuous rain, headwinds and waves that threatened the boats. One night while the men slept on shore, one of the boats was capsized while at anchor and was swept out to sea with its two boatkeepers. One of the men got ashore but the other drowned. As it was now impossible for them all to fit in the remaining boat, four marines were left ashore with muskets to fend for themselves. The winds prevented them from getting around the headland so they returned to pick up the marines only to find them gone. They returned to Wager Island in early February 1742. With one death on the journey, there were now 13 in the group.

Martín Olleta, a Chono chieftain, guided the men up the coast to the Spanish settlements of Chiloé Island so they set out again. Two men died; after burying the bodies, the six seamen rowed off in the boat never to be seen again while Cheape, Hamilton, Byron, Campbell and the dying Elliot were on shore looking for food. Olleta then agreed to take the remaining four on by canoe for their only remaining possession, a musket. It is likely the party travelled across Presidente Ríos Lake in inland Taitao Peninsula, a lake Chile regarded as officially discovered in 1945. Eventually they made it to be taken prisoner by the Spanish. The Spaniards treated them well and they were eventually taken to the inland capital of Santiago where they were released on parole. The Spaniards heard that Anson had been generous in the treatment of the prisoners he had taken and this kindness was returned.

Byron and the other three men stayed in Santiago till late 1744 and were offered passage on a French ship bound for Spain. Three accepted the passage. Campbell elected to take a mule across the Andes and joined the Spanish Admiral Pizarro in Montevideo on the &quot;Asia&quot; only to find Isaac Morris and the two seamen who had been abandoned in Freshwater Bay on the Atlantic coast. After time in prison in Spain, Campbell reached Britain in May 1746, followed by the other three two months later.

In England, the official court martial examined only the loss of the &quot;Wager&quot; in which Baynes, in nominal charge at the time, was acquitted of blame but reprimanded for omissions of duty. Disputes over what happened after the wreck were instead played out as Bulkeley and Cummins, Campbell, Morris, the cooper Young and later Byron published their own accounts, the last of which was the only one that in any way defended Cheap who had since died. Twenty-nine crew members plus seven marines made it back to England.

Byron&#x27;s account of his adventures and the &quot;Wager&quot; Mutiny are recounted in &quot;The Narrative of the Honourable John Byron&quot; (1768). His book sold well enough to be printed in several editions.

Byron was appointed captain of in December 1746.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

In 1760, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, Byron commanded a squadron sent to destroy the fortifications at Louisbourg, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, which had been captured by the British two years before. They wanted to ensure it could not be used by the French in Canada. In July of that year he defeated the French flotilla sent to relieve New France at the Battle of Restigouche.

== Commodore, governor, and vice admiral ==
In early 1764 the British Admiralty determined that it would require a permanent naval settlement off the South American coast, in order to resupply naval vessels seeking to enter the Pacific via Cape Horn. Captain Byron was selected to explore the South Atlantic for a suitable island upon which to establish such a settlement. The South American mainland was controlled by Spain, which was hostile to local expansion of British interests; to disguise Byron&#x27;s mission it was announced that he had been appointed the new Navy Commander-in-Chief, East Indies. Byron set sail in June 1764, ostensibly to take up the East Indies post. For the voyage he was granted command of the 24-gun frigate and the 16-gun sloop .

Byron&#x27;s two-vessel flotilla crossed the Atlantic over the winter of 1764 and made its way slowly down the South American coast. The Admiralty had ordered Byron to first seek Pepys Island, reputedly discovered off the Patagonian coast by the corsair Ambrose Cowley in 1683. Byron reached the co-ordinates given by Cowley in January 1765, but there was no sign of the island and the search was swiftly abandoned. On 5 February Byron reached the Patagonian settlement of Port Desire where he resupplied his vessels from the storeship HMS &quot;Florida&quot;.

Between June 1764 and May 1766, Byron completed his own circumnavigation of the globe as captain of HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;. This was the first such circumnavigation that was accomplished in less than 2 years. His actions nearly caused a war between Great Britain and Spain, as both countries had armed fleets ready to contest the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. Later Byron encountered islands and extant residents of the Tuamotus and Tokelau Islands, and Nikunau in the southern Gilbert Islands; he also visited Tinian in the Northern Marianas Islands. A notable member of Byron&#x27;s crew was Master&#x27;s Mate Erasmus Gower whom Byron chose to &#x27;take a significant part&#x27; in the ceremony when he took possession of the Falkland Islands. Byron had examined Gower for his lieutenant&#x27;s examination in 1762 and was so impressed that he chose him to accompany him on his own circumnavigation (1764–65) and ensured that he was appointed as lieutenant to Commander Philip Carteret immediately afterwards in the next circumnavigation (1766–69).

In 1769 he was appointed governor of Newfoundland off the mainland of Canada, an office he held for the next three years.

He was promoted to rear admiral on 31 March 1775. In 1779, he served as Commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands Station during the American War of Independence. After being severely injured during a storm on his way to the West Indies, Byron unsuccessfully attacked a French fleet under the Comte d&#x27;Estaing at the Battle of Grenada in July 1779. He subsequently resigned his post and returned to England, where he suffered from poor health for the rest of his life.

Byron was briefly Commander-in-Chief, North American Station from 1 October 1779. He was made vice admiral of the white in September 1780.

==Family==

On 8 September 1748 he married his first cousin Sophia Trevanion, daughter of John Trevanion of Caerhays in Cornwall and Barbara Berkeley, the sister of his mother. They had two sons and seven daughters:

* Frances Byron (1749–1823), later married Charles Leigh
* Sophia Byron (died in infancy)
* Isabella Byron (died in infancy)
* Juliana Elizabeth Byron (1754–88), later married her cousin Hon. William Byron (d. 1776, son of William Byron, 5th Baron Byron)
* Sophia Maria Byron (1755–1821), the &#x27;maiden aunt&#x27; of the poet George Gordon Byron
* John &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Byron (1757–91), who in turn fathered the poet George Gordon Byron, the future 6th Baron Byron
* George Anson Byron (1758–93), noted navy officer and father of George Anson Byron junior, another admiral and explorer and later the 7th Baron Byron
* Charlotte Byron (died in infancy) 
* Augusta Barbara Charlotte Byron (1762–1824), later married Admiral Christopher Parker

John was the brother of Hon. George Byron, married to Frances Levett, daughter of Elton Levett of Nottingham, a descendant of Ambrose Elton, Esq., High Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1618 and a surgeon in Nottingham.

==Death and legacy==

According to a note written by his wife Sophia to their financial agent, John Byron died on 1 April 1786 at home in Bolton Row, London (not 10 April, as subsequent biographies claim). On that date nine days later his remains were buried in the Berkeley family vault situated beneath the chancel of the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Twickenham.

John&#x27;s life was a great inspiration for his grandson the poet George Gordon Byron, though they never met. The poet both drew from his grandfather&#x27;s experiences in his writing, using his &#x27;Narrative&#x27; for the shipwreck scene in &quot;Don Juan&quot;, and wrote of the kinship he felt in having such a turbulent, unlucky life: he wrote in an epistle to his half-sister Augusta Leigh that &quot;he had no rest at sea, nor I on shore&quot;.

==In fiction==
John Byron&#x27;s experiences in the Anson voyage form the basis of the novel &quot;The Unknown Shore&quot; by Patrick O&#x27;Brian. It closely follows Byron&#x27;s account in &quot;The Narrative of the Honourable John Byron&quot; (1768).

In &quot;The Dark Design&quot; by Philip José Farmer, John Byron is a crewmember of the schooner &quot;The Razzle Dazzle&quot;.

<doc id="44086" wikidata="Q357102" url="?curid=44086" title="Lew Wallace">
<text>Lewis Wallace (April 10, 1827February 15, 1905) was an American lawyer, Union general in the American Civil War, governor of New Mexico Territory, politician, diplomat, artist, and author from Indiana. Among his novels and biographies, Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story, &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot; (1880), a bestselling novel that has been called &quot;the most influential Christian book of the nineteenth century.&quot;

Wallace&#x27;s military career included service in the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War. He was appointed Indiana&#x27;s adjutant general and commanded the 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment. Wallace, who attained the rank of major general, participated in the Battle of Fort Donelson, the Battle of Shiloh, and the Battle of Monocacy. He also served on the military commission for the trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators, and presided over the trial of Henry Wirz, the Confederate commandant of the Andersonville prison camp.

Wallace resigned from the U.S. Army in November 1865 and briefly served as a major general in the Mexican Army, before returning to the United States. Wallace was appointed governor of the New Mexico Territory (1878–1881) and served as U.S. minister to the Ottoman Empire (1881–1885). Wallace retired to his home in Crawfordsville, Indiana, where he continued to write until his death in 1905.

==Early life and education==
Lewis &quot;Lew&quot; Wallace was born on April 10, 1827, in Brookville, Indiana. He was the second of four sons born to Esther French Wallace (née Test) and David Wallace. Lew&#x27;s father, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, left the military in 1822 and moved to Brookville, where he established a law practice and entered Indiana politics. David served in the Indiana General Assembly and later as the state&#x27;s lieutenant governor, and governor, and as a member of Congress. Lew Wallace&#x27;s maternal grandfather was circuit court judge and Congressman John Test.

In 1832 the family moved to Covington, Indiana, where Lew&#x27;s mother died from tuberculosis on July 14, 1834. In December 1836, David married nineteen-year-old Zerelda Gray Sanders Wallace, who later became a prominent suffragist and temperance advocate. In 1837, after David&#x27;s election as governor of Indiana, the family moved to Indianapolis.

Lew began his formal education at the age of six at a public school in Covington, but he much preferred the outdoors. Wallace had a talent for drawing and loved to read, but he was a discipline problem at school. In 1836, at the age of nine, Lew joined his older brother in Crawfordsville, Indiana, where he briefly attended the preparatory school division of Wabash College, but soon transferred to another school more suitable for his age. In 1840, when Wallace was thirteen, his father sent him to a private academy at Centerville, Indiana, where his teacher encouraged Lew&#x27;s natural affinity for writing. Wallace returned to Indianapolis the following year.

Sixteen-year-old Lew went out to earn his own wages in 1842, after his father refused to pay for more schooling. Wallace found a job copying records at the Marion County clerk&#x27;s office and lived in an Indianapolis boardinghouse. He also joined the Marion Rifles, a local militia unit, and began writing his first novel, &quot;The Fair God&quot;, but it was not published until 1873. Wallace said in his autobiography that he had never been a member of any organized religion, but he did believe &quot;in the Christian conception of God&quot;.

By 1846, at the start of the Mexican–American War, the nineteen-year-old Wallace was studying law at his father&#x27;s law office, but left that pursuit to establish a recruiting office for the Marion Volunteers in Indianapolis. He was appointed a second lieutenant, and on June 19, 1846, mustered into military service with the Marion Volunteers (also known as Company H, 1st Indiana Volunteer Infantry). Wallace rose to the position of regimental adjutant and the rank of first lieutenant while serving in the army of Zachary Taylor, but Wallace personally did not participate in combat. Wallace was mustered out of the volunteer service on June 15, 1847, and returned to Indiana, where he intended to practice law. After the war, Wallace and William B. Greer operated a Free Soil newspaper, &quot;The Free Soil Banner,&quot; in Indianapolis.

==Marriage and family==
In 1848 Wallace met Susan Elston at the Crawfordsville home of Henry S. Lane, Wallace&#x27;s former commander during the Mexican War. Susan was the daughter of Major Isaac Compton Elston, a wealthy Crawfordsville merchant, and Maria Akin Elston, whose family were Quakers from upstate New York. Susan accepted Wallace&#x27;s marriage proposal in 1849, and they were married in Crawfordsville on May 6, 1852. The Wallaces had one son, Henry Lane Wallace, who was born on February 17, 1853.

==Early law and military career==
Wallace was admitted to the bar in February 1849, and moved from Indianapolis to Covington, Indiana, where he established a law practice. In 1851 Wallace was elected prosecuting attorney of Indiana&#x27;s 1st congressional district, but he resigned in 1853 and moved his family to Crawfordsville, in Montgomery County, Indiana. Wallace continued to practice law and was elected as a Democrat to a two-year term in the Indiana Senate in 1856. From 1849 to 1853, his office was housed in the Fountain County Clerk&#x27;s Building.

While living in Crawfordsville, Wallace organized the Crawfordsville Guards Independent Militia, later called the Montgomery Guards. During the winter of 1859–60, after reading about elite units of the French Army in Algeria, Wallace adopted the Zouave uniform and their system of training for the group. The Montgomery Guards would later form the core of his first military command, the 11th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, during the American Civil War.

==Civil War service==
Wallace, a staunch supporter of the Union, became a member of the Republican party, and began his full-time military career soon after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861. Indiana&#x27;s governor, the Republican Oliver P. Morton, asked Wallace to help recruit Indiana volunteers for the Union army. Wallace, who also sought a military command, agreed to become the state&#x27;s adjutant general on the condition that he would be given command of a regiment of his choice. Indiana&#x27;s quota of six regimental units was filled within a week, and Wallace took command of the 11th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment, which was mustered into the Union army on April 25, 1861. Wallace received his formal commission as a colonel in the Union army the following day.

On June 5, 1861, Wallace went with the 11th Indiana to Cumberland, Maryland, and on June 12, the regiment won a minor battle at Romney, Virginia, (in present-day West Virginia). The rout boosted morale for Union troops and led to the Confederate evacuation of Harpers Ferry on June 18. On September 3, 1861, Wallace was promoted to brigadier general of U.S. Army volunteers and given command of a brigade.

===Forts Henry and Donelson===

On February 4 and 5, 1862, prior to the advance against Fort Henry, Union troops under the command of Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and a flotilla of Union ironclads and timberclad gunboats under the command of Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote made their way toward the Confederate fort along the Tennessee River in western Tennessee. Wallace&#x27;s brigade, which was attached to Brig. Gen. Charles F. Smith&#x27;s division, was ordered to occupy Fort Heiman, an uncompleted Confederate fort across the river from Fort Henry. Wallace&#x27;s troops secured the deserted fort and watched the Union attack on Fort Henry from their hilltop position. On February 6, after more than an hour of bombardment from the Union gunboats, Confederate Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, surrendered Fort Henry to Foote.
Grant&#x27;s superior, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, was concerned that Confederate reinforcements would try to retake the two forts when the Union troops moved overland toward Fort Donelson, so Wallace was left in command at Fort Henry to keep the forts secure. Displeased to have been left behind, Wallace prepared his troops to move out at a moment&#x27;s notice. The order came at midnight on February 13. Wallace arrived in front of Fort Donelson the following day and was placed in charge of the newly-forming 3rd Division. Many of the men in the division were untested reinforcements. Wallace&#x27;s three brigades took up position in the center of the Union line, facing Fort Donelson.

During the fierce Confederate assault on February 15, and with Grant&#x27;s absence from the battlefield, Wallace acted on his own initiative to send Cruft&#x27;s brigade to reinforce the beleaguered division of Brig. Gen. John A. McClernand, despite orders from Grant to hold his position and prevent the enemy from escaping and without Grant&#x27;s authority to take the offensive. With the Confederates continuing to advance, Wallace led a second brigade to the right and engaged the Confederates with infantry and artillery. Wallace&#x27;s decision stopped their forward movement and was key in stabilizing a defensive line for the Union troops. After the Confederate assault had been checked, Wallace led a counterattack that regained the lost ground on the Union right. On March 21, 1862, McClernand, C. F. Smith, and Wallace were promoted to major general in that order for their efforts. Wallace, who was age thirty-four at the time of his promotion, became the youngest major general in the Union army.

===Shiloh===
Wallace&#x27;s most controversial command came at the battle of Shiloh, where he continued as the 3rd Division commander under Maj. Gen. Grant. What was to become a long-standing controversy developed around the contents of Wallace&#x27;s written orders on April 6, the 3rd Division&#x27;s movements on the first day of battle, and its late arrival on the field. The next day, the reinforcement by Wallace&#x27;s division and the juncture of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio permitted the Union forces to push back the enemy all day long to gain the victory.

Prior to the battle, Wallace&#x27;s division had been detached and was encamped near Crump&#x27;s Landing, five miles downstream from Pittsburg Landing and the bulk of Grant&#x27;s army. Wallace&#x27;s orders were to guard the Union&#x27;s rear and to cover the road leading west to Bethel Station, Tennessee, where railroad lines led to Corinth, Mississippi, to the south. To protect the road from Crump&#x27;s Landing and Bethel Station, Wallace sent Col. John M. Thayer&#x27;s 2nd Brigade to Stoney Lonesome, west of Crump&#x27;s Landing, and the 3rd Brigade, commanded by Col. Charles Whittlesey to Adamsville, west of Crump&#x27;s Landing. Col. Morgan L. Smith&#x27;s 1st Brigade remained with Wallace at Crump&#x27;s Landing, north of Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee.

Around 5 a.m. on April 6, 1862, the Battle of Shiloh began in which Grant&#x27;s army at Pittsburg Landing was surprised and began being pushed back by a sudden attack from the Confederate army under Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston. Grant, who heard the early morning artillery fire, took a steamboat upriver from his headquarters at Savannah, Tennessee, briefly stopping at Crump&#x27;s Landing, where he gave Wallace orders to wait, but be ready to move in any direction. Grant proceeded to Pittsburg Landing, where he arrived around 9:00 or 9:30 a.m. Grant&#x27;s new orders to Wallace, which arrived between 11 and 11:30 a.m., were given verbally to Grant&#x27;s quartermaster, who transcribed them before they were delivered. The written orders were lost during the battle, so their exact wording cannot be confirmed; however, most eyewitness accounts agree that Grant ordered Wallace to join the right side of the Union army, presumably in support of Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s 5th Division, which was encamped near Shiloh Church on the morning of April 6.

Knowledge of the area&#x27;s roads played a critical role in Wallace&#x27;s journey to the battlefield on April 6. In late March, after heavy rains made transportation difficult between Crump&#x27;s Landing and Pittsburg Landing, Wallace&#x27;s men had opened a route to Pittsburg Landing along Shunpike road, which connected to a road near Sherman&#x27;s camp. Brig. Gen. W. H. L. Wallace&#x27;s men at Pittsburg Landing opened the River Road (also known as the Hamburg-Savannah Road), a route farther east.

Of the two main routes that Wallace could use to move his men to the front, he chose the Shunpike road, the more direct route to reach the right of Sherman&#x27;s division near Shiloh Church. The day before the battle, Wallace wrote a letter to W. H. L. Wallace, recommending this route to reinforce the 3rd Division. Lew Wallace and his staff maintained after the battle that Grant&#x27;s order did not specify Pittsburg Landing as their destination, and that it did not specify which route the 3rd Division was ordered to take. However, Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had ordered Wallace to take the route nearest to the river to reach Pittsburg Landing. Historians are divided, with some stating that Wallace&#x27;s explanation is the most logical.

After a second messenger from Grant arrived around noon with word to move out, Wallace&#x27;s division of approximately 5,800 men began their march toward the battlefield. Between 2 and 2:30 p.m., Colonel William R. Rowley, sent by Grant, rode to where Wallace&#x27;s division first was; there was only a supply wagon departing the scene. Riding on further, Rowley found Wallace along the Shunpike road at the head of his column near Clear Creek, positioned on high ground. He informed Wallace that Sherman had been forced back from Shiloh Church and was fighting closer to the river, near Pittsburg Landing. Grant had ordered Rowley to &quot;tell him to come up at once&quot; and that &quot;if he should require a written order of you, you will give it to him at once&quot;. Rowley pulled Wallace off to the side and warned him of the danger that lay just ahead, exclaiming, &quot;Don&#x27;t you know that Sherman has been driven back? Why, the whole army is within half a mile of the river, and it&#x27;s a question if we are not all going to be driven into it.&quot; Wallace, stunned by the news, sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation, and upon returning, it had confirmed Rowley&#x27;s claim. The Union army had been pushed back so far that Wallace was heading toward the rear of the advancing Southern troops.

Wallace briefly considered attacking the Confederates, but abandoned the idea. Instead he made a controversial decision to countermarch his first two brigades along the Shunpike road, follow a crossroads to the River Road, and then move south to Pittsburg Landing. Rather than realigning his troops, so that the rear guard would be in the front, Wallace countermarched his column to maintain their original order, keeping his artillery in position to support the Union infantry on the field. After the time-consuming maneuver was completed, Wallace&#x27;s troops returned to the midpoint on the Shunpike road, crossed east over a path to the River Road, and followed it south to join Grant&#x27;s army on the field. Progress was slow due to the atrocious road conditions and the countermarch. Wallace&#x27;s division arrived at Pittsburg Landing about 6:30 p.m., after having marched about in nearly seven hours over roads that had been left in terrible conditions by recent rainstorms and previous Union marches. They gathered at the battlefield at dusk, about 7 p.m., with the fighting basically over for the day, and took up a position on the right of the Union line.
The next day, April 7, Wallace&#x27;s division held the extreme right of the Union line. Two of Wallace&#x27;s batteries with the aid of a battery from the 1st Illinois Light Artillery were the first to attack at about 5:30 a.m. Sherman&#x27;s and Wallace&#x27;s troops helped force the Confederates to fall back, and by 3 p.m. the Confederates were retreating southwest, toward Corinth.

Historian Timothy B. Smith noted that on the second day Wallace&#x27;s division sustained far fewer casualties (296) than any of Buell&#x27;s three divisions. The number of casualties does not always show the effectiveness of troops. Wallace had his soldiers lie down when they were under fire, which minimized casualties. He also maneuvered his division so that it repeatedly turned the Confederate left flank. Wallace advanced his division at 6:30 am, reached the south side of Tilghman Branch about 8:00 am, and occupied a commanding ridge by 9:00 am, all with little opposition. Here he paused to wait for Union troops to appear on his left. Up to this point, Wallace&#x27;s movements were slow. Once Grant&#x27;s and Buell&#x27;s soldiers reached the Confederate main line of defense they were stopped in heavy fighting. Noting that the Confederate left did not reach as far as Owl Creek, Wallace wheeled his division to outflank the enemy line. Finding Wallace&#x27;s troops to their left and rear, the left-hand Confederate brigade hurriedly fell back. This unhinged the entire line and the Confederate troops soon retreated to a second position around noon. At around 1:00 pm, Wallace worked a few regiments around the Confederate left flank, forcing their withdrawal to a third position. After the Confederates left the battlefield, Wallace&#x27;s division went the farthest south of the Union forces, but he pulled his troops back before going into camp that evening.

===Shiloh controversy===

At first, the battle was viewed by the North as a victory; however, on April 23, after civilians began hearing news of the surprise and resulting high number of casualties, the Lincoln administration asked the Union army for further explanation. Grant, who was accused of poor leadership at Shiloh, and his superior, Halleck, tried to place the blame on Wallace by asserting that his failure to follow orders and the delay in moving up his division on April 6 had nearly cost the Union the battle.

After hearing reports that Wallace refused to obey anything but &quot;written&quot; orders, an angry General Grant asserted that a division general &quot;ought to take his troops to wherever the firing may be, even without orders&quot;.

On April 30, 1862, Halleck reorganized his army and removed Wallace and John McClernand from the front lines, placing both of them in reserve, with McClernand commanding.

Wallace&#x27;s reputation and career as a military leader suffered a significant setback from controversy over Shiloh. He spent the remainder of his life trying to resolve the accusations and change public opinion about his role in the battle. On March 14, 1863, Wallace wrote a letter to Halleck that provided an official explanation of his actions. He also wrote Grant several letters and met with him in person more than once in an attempt to vindicate himself. On August 16, 1863, Wallace wrote Sherman for advice on the issue. Sherman urged Wallace to be patient and not to request a formal inquiry. Although Sherman brought Wallace&#x27;s concerns to Grant&#x27;s attention, Wallace was not given another active duty command until March 1864.

For many years Grant stood by his original version of the orders to Wallace. As late as 1884, when Grant wrote an article on Shiloh for &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; that appeared in its February 1885 issue, he maintained that Wallace had taken the wrong road on the first day of battle. After W. H. L. Wallace&#x27;s widow gave Grant a letter that Lew Wallace had written to her husband the day before the battle (the one indicating his plans to use the Shunpike road to pass between Shiloh and his position west of Crump&#x27;s Landing), Grant changed his mind. Grant wrote a letter to the editors at &quot;Century&quot;, which was published in its September 1885 issue, and added a note to his memoirs to explain that Wallace&#x27;s letter &quot;modifies very materially what I have said, and what has been said by others, about the conduct of General Lew Wallace at the battle of Shiloh.&quot; While reaffirming that he had ordered Wallace to take the River Road, Grant stated that he could not be sure the exact content of Wallace&#x27;s written orders, since his verbal orders were given to one of his aides and transcribed.

Grant&#x27;s article in the February 1885 issue of &quot;Century&quot; became the basis of his chapter on Shiloh in his memoirs, which were published in 1886, and influenced many later accounts of Wallace&#x27;s actions on the first day of battle. Grant acknowledged in his memoirs: &quot;If the position of our front had not changed, the road which Wallace took would have been somewhat shorter to our right than the River road.&quot; Wallace&#x27;s account of the events appeared in his autobiography, which was published posthumously in 1906. Despite his later fame and fortune as the writer of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, Wallace continued to lament, &quot;Shiloh and its slanders! Will the world ever acquit me of them? If I were guilty I would not feel them as keenly.&quot;

===The Kentucky Campaign and Defense of Cincinnati===

Following his loss of a field command, Wallace returned to Indiana and spent time at his retreat on the Kankakee River. It was there that he received a telegram from Governor Morton to take command of an Indiana regiment in the Department of the Ohio to help with the defense of Kentucky during Braxton Bragg&#x27;s incursion into Kentucky and to report to Louisville. Presenting himself with his new regiment to Brig. Gen. Jeremiah Boyle in Louisville, Boyle was uncomfortable having a superior officer under his command. Boyle ordered Wallace to take his regiment to Lexington, take command of the hastily created Army of Kentucky, and march to the relief of the men at Cumberland Gap. Wallace began a defensive plan that would place his army on the north side of the Kentucky River, about 15 miles from Boonesboro to defend against the advance of Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith&#x27;s army from the direction of Cumberland Gap. He had all of the locks on the river in the area opened to flood the fords, confiscated every boat in the area and moved them to the north bank, and the position was secured by sheer limestone cliffs on his flanks. But Wallace was soon relieved of command by Maj. Gen. William &quot;Bull&quot; Nelson, who took command of the Army of Kentucky on August 24 on orders from Wright. Nelson altered Wallace&#x27;s defensive plan, and engaged Smith&#x27;s Confederate Army of Kentucky at the Battle of Richmond on August 30, and was soundly defeated.

Wallace and his staff started a return to Cincinnati to await any orders. Maj. Gen. Horatio Wright sent a telegram ordering Wallace to return to Lexington to take command of what remained of the Army of Kentucky. Traveling by train from Cincinnati, Wallace received another telegram from Wright when he arrived at Paris, Kentucky, ordering him to remain in Cincinnati. He immediately returned to Cincinnati and began vigorous efforts for the defense of Cincinnati.

Upon his arrival in the city, Wallace immediately began organizing the defenses of Cincinnati, Ohio and the Kentucky cities of Covington and Newport south of Cincinnati. Wallace ordered martial law, set a strict curfew, closed all businesses, and began putting male citizens to work on rifle pits, felling trees for makeshift abatis and clear fields of fire, and improving the 1861 earthwork defenses. It was during this hasty defensive preparation that the Black Brigade of Cincinnati was formed, by Wallace&#x27;s orders.

In response to calls from Ohio&#x27;s Governor Tod, approximately 15,000 so-called &quot;Squirrel Hunters&quot;—untrained volunteers who carried outdated equipment—reported to Cincinnati. Additionally, newly-created regiments from Indiana and Ohio were rushed to Cincinnati; most had not completed their training.

Because the arriving regiments could not be ferried quickly enough across the Ohio River, Wallace ordered the construction of a pontoon bridge, which was constructed using coal barges in under 48 hours.

While at Lexington, Gen. Smith gave Brig. Gen. Henry Heth permission to make a &quot;demonstration&quot; on Cincinnati, granting him approximately 8,000 men. Heth moved within a few miles of Fort Mitchell and exchanged skirmish fire with men from the 101st Ohio Infantry, 103rd Ohio Infantry, and 104th Ohio Infantry on September 10–11, then returned to Lexington on September 12, 1862.

Wallace&#x27;s leadership during the defense of Cincinnati earned him the nickname by local newspapers as the &quot;Savior of Cincinnati&quot;. On September 12, Wallace telegraphed Wright from Cincinnati: &quot;The skedaddle is complete; every sign of a rout. If you say so I will organize a column of 20,000 men to pursue to-night.&quot; Instead, Wright relieved Wallace of a field command.

===Other military assignments===
Wallace was ordered to take command of Camp Chase, a prisoner-of-war camp at Columbus, Ohio, where he remained until October 30, 1862. His instructions there were to recruit and train Confederate prisoners of war for U.S. Army service (also known as &quot;Galvanized Yankees&quot;) to aid in the Sioux Uprising. The Battle of Wood Lake on September 23 essentially ended the uprising and Wallace was again without a command.

The following month, Wallace was placed in charge of the five-member commission Buell Military Commission to investigate Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell&#x27;s conduct in response to the Confederate invasion of Kentucky. The commission criticized Buell for his retreat, but it did not find him disloyal to the Union. When the commission&#x27;s work was completed on May 6, 1863, Wallace returned to Indiana to wait for a new command. In mid-July 1863, while Wallace was home, he helped protect the railroad junction at North Vernon, Indiana, from Confederate general John Hunt Morgan&#x27;s raid into southern Indiana.

===Monocacy===

Wallace&#x27;s most notable service came on Saturday, July 9, 1864, at the Battle of Monocacy part of the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Although Confederate General Jubal A. Early and an estimated 15,000 troops defeated Wallace&#x27;s troops at Monocacy Junction, Maryland, forcing them to retreat to Baltimore, the effort cost Early a chance to capture Washington, D.C. Wallace&#x27;s men were able to delay the Confederate advance toward Washington for an entire day, giving the city time to organize its defenses. Early arrived in Washington at around noon on July 11, two days after defeating Wallace at Monocacy, the northernmost Confederate victory of the war, but Union reinforcements had already arrived at Fort Stevens to repel the Confederates and force their retreat to Virginia.

Wallace, who had returned to active duty on March 12, 1864, assumed command of VIII Corps, which was headquartered in Baltimore. On July 9, a combined Union force of approximately 5,800 men under Wallace&#x27;s command (mostly hundred-days&#x27; men from VIII Corps) and a division under James B. Ricketts from VI Corps encountered Confederate troops at Monocacy Junction between 9 and 10 a.m. Although Wallace was uncertain whether Baltimore or Washington, D.C., was the Confederate objective, he knew his troops would have to delay the advance until Union reinforcements arrived. Wallace&#x27;s men repelled the Confederate attacks for more than six hours before retreating to Baltimore.

After the battle Wallace informed Halleck that his forces fought until 5 p.m., but the Confederate troops, which he estimated at 20,000 men, had overwhelmed them. When Grant learned of the defeat, he named Maj. Gen. E. O. C. Ord as Wallace&#x27;s replacement in command of VIII Corps. On July 28, after officials learned how Wallace&#x27;s efforts at Monocacy helped save Washington D.C. from capture, he was reinstated as commander of VIII Corps. In Grant&#x27;s memoirs, he praised Wallace&#x27;s delaying tactics at Monocacy:

If Early had been but one day earlier, he might have entered the capital before the arrival of the reinforcements I had sent. ... General Wallace contributed on this occasion by the defeat of the troops under him, a greater benefit to the cause than often falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to render by means of a victory.

===Later military service===
On January 22, 1865, Grant ordered Wallace to the Rio Grande in southern Texas to investigate Confederate military operations in the area. Although Wallace was not officially authorized to offer terms, he did discuss proposals for the surrender of the Confederate troops in the Trans-Mississippi Department. Wallace provided Grant with copies of his proposals and reported on the negotiations, but no agreement was made. Before returning to Baltimore, Wallace also met with Mexican military leaders to discuss the U.S. government&#x27;s unofficial efforts to aid in expelling Maximilian&#x27;s French occupation forces from Mexico.

Following President Lincoln&#x27;s death on April 15, 1865, Wallace was appointed to the military commission that investigated the Lincoln assassination conspirators. The commission, which began in May, was dissolved on June 30, 1865, after all eight conspirators were found guilty. In mid-August 1865, Wallace was appointed head of an eight-member military commission that investigated the conduct of Henry Wirz, the Confederate commandant in charge of the South&#x27;s Andersonville prison camp. The court-martial which took nearly two months, opened on August 21, 1865. At its conclusion Wirz was found guilty and sentenced to death.

On April 30, 1865, Wallace had accepted an offer to become a major general in the Mexican army, but the agreement, which was contingent upon his resignation from the U.S. Army, was delayed by Wallace&#x27;s service on the two military commissions. Wallace tendered his resignation from the U.S. Army on November 4, 1865, effective November 30, and returned to Mexico to assist the Mexican army. Although the Juárez government promised Wallace $100,000 for his services, he returned to the United States in 1867 in deep financial debt.

After the war, Wallace became a companion of the Indiana Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==Political and diplomatic career==
Wallace returned to Indiana in 1867 to practice law, but the profession did not appeal to him, and he turned to politics. Wallace made two unsuccessful bids for a seat in Congress (in 1868 and 1870), and supported Republican presidential candidate Rutherford B. Hayes in the 1876 election. As a reward for his political support, Hayes appointed Wallace as governor of the New Mexico Territory, where he served from August 1878 to March 1881. His next assignment came in March 1881, when Republican president James A. Garfield appointed Wallace to an overseas diplomatic post in Constantinople as U.S. Minister to the Ottoman Empire. Wallace remained in this post until 1885.

===Territorial governor of New Mexico===
Wallace arrived in Santa Fe on September 29, 1878, to begin his service as governor of the New Mexico Territory during a time of lawless violence and political corruption. Wallace was involved in efforts to resolve New Mexico&#x27;s Lincoln County War, a contentious and violent disagreement among the county&#x27;s residents, and tried to end a series of Apache raids on territorial settlers. In 1880, while living at the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe, Wallace also completed the manuscript for &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot;.

On March 1, 1879, after previous efforts to restore order in Lincoln County had failed, Wallace ordered the arrest of those responsible for local killings. One of the outlaws was William Henry McCarty Jr. (alias William H. Bonney), better known as Billy the Kid. On March 17, 1879, Wallace secretly met with Bonney, who had witnessed the murder of a Lincoln County lawyer named Huston Chapman. Wallace wanted him to testify in the trial of Chapman&#x27;s accused murderers, but Bonney wanted Wallace&#x27;s protection from his enemies and amnesty for his earlier crimes. During their meeting, the pair arranged for Bonney to become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured the Kid that he would be &quot;scot free with a pardon in your pocket for all your misdeeds.&quot; On March 20 Bonney agreed to provide grand jury testimony against those involved in Chapman&#x27;s murder. Wallace arranged for a &quot;fake&quot; arrest and Bonney&#x27;s detention in a local jail to assure his safety. Bonney testified in court on April 14, as agreed. However, the local district attorney revoked Wallace&#x27;s bargain and refused to set the outlaw free. After spending several weeks in jail, Bonney escaped and returned to his criminal ways, which included killing additional men. He was shot and killed on July 14, 1881, by Sheriff Pat Garrett, who had been appointed by local ranching interests who had tired of his rustling their herds. In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.

On December 31, 2010, on his last day in office, then-Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico declined a pardon request from Bonney&#x27;s supporters, citing a &quot;lack of conclusiveness and the historical ambiguity&quot; over Wallace&#x27;s promise of amnesty. Descendants of Wallace and Garrett were among those who opposed the pardon.

===U.S. diplomat in the Ottoman Empire===
On May 19, 1881, Wallace was appointed U.S. Minister to the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul, Turkey). Wallace remained at the diplomatic post until 1885, and became a trusted friend of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. When a crisis developed between the Turkish and British governments over control of Egypt, Wallace served as an intermediary between the sultan and Lord Dufferin, the British ambassador. Although Wallace&#x27;s efforts were unsuccessful, he earned respect for his efforts and a promotion in the U.S. diplomatic service.

In 1883, an editorial aimed at Wallace appeared in the newspaper &quot;Havatzelet&quot; (xiii. No. 6) titled &quot;An American and yet a Despot&quot;. The editorial caused the &quot;Havatzelet&quot; to be suspended and its editor Israel Dov Frumkin to be imprisoned for forty-five days by order from Constantinople, directed to the pasha of the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem. The incident that led to the editorial was the dismissal, made at Wallace&#x27;s request, of Joseph Kriger, the Jewish secretary and interpreter to the pasha of Jerusalem. Wallace complained that Kriger had failed to receive him with the honor due to his rank, and refused to issue any apology for the alleged shortcoming. &quot;Havatzelet&quot; claimed that the proceeding was instigated by missionaries, whom Wallace strongly supported.

In addition to Wallace&#x27;s diplomatic duties, which included protection of U.S. citizens and U.S. trade rights in the area, Wallace found time to travel and do historical research. Wallace visited Jerusalem and the surrounding area, a setting in his previous novel, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, and did research in Constantinople, the locale for &quot;The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell&quot;, which he began writing in 1887.

The election of Grover Cleveland, the Democratic candidate for president, ended Wallace&#x27;s political appointment. He resigned from the U.S. diplomatic service on March 4, 1885. The sultan wanted Wallace to continue to work in the Ottoman Empire, and even made a proposal to have him represent Ottoman interests in England or France, but Wallace declined and returned home to Crawfordsville.

==Writing career==
Wallace confessed in his autobiography that he took up writing as a diversion from studying law. Although he wrote several books, Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story, &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot; (1880), which established his fame as an author.

In 1843, Wallace began writing his first novel, &quot;The Fair God&quot;, but it was not published until 1873. The popular historical novel, with Cortez&#x27;s conquest of Mexico as its central theme, was based on William H. Prescott&#x27;s &quot;History of the Conquest of Mexico&quot;. Wallace&#x27;s book sold seven thousand copies in its first year. Its sales continued to rise after Wallace&#x27;s reputation as an author was established with the publication of subsequent novels.

Wallace wrote the manuscript for &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, his second and best-known novel, during his spare time at Crawfordsville, and completed it in Santa Fe, while serving as the territorial governor of New Mexico. &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, an adventure story of revenge and redemption, is told from the perspective of a Jewish nobleman named Judah Ben-Hur. Because Wallace had not been to the Holy Land before writing the book, he began research to familiarize himself with the area&#x27;s geography and its history at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., in 1873. Harper and Brothers published the book on November 12, 1880.

&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; made Wallace a wealthy man and established his reputation as a famous author. Sales were slow at first; only 2,800 copies were sold in the first seven months after its release, but the book became popular among readers around the world. By 1886, it was earning Wallace about $11,000 in annual royalties (equivalent to $290,000 in 2015 dollars), and provided Wallace&#x27;s family with financial security. By 1889, Harper and Brothers had sold 400,000 copies and the book had been translated into several languages.

In 1900, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; became the best-selling American novel of the 19th century, surpassing Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Amy Lifson, an editor for &quot;Humanities&quot;, identified it as the most influential Christian book of the 19th century. Others named it one of the best-selling novels of all time. At the time of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;″s one hundredth anniversary in 1980, it had &quot;never been out of print&quot; and had been adapted for the stage and several motion pictures. One historian, Victor Davis Hanson, has argued that &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; drew from Wallace&#x27;s life, particularly his experiences at Shiloh, and the damage it did to his reputation. The book&#x27;s main character, Judah Ben-Hur, accidentally causes injury to a high-ranking Roman commander, for which he and his family suffer tribulations and calumny.

Wallace wrote subsequent novels and biographies, but &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; remained his most important work. Wallace considered &quot;The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell&quot; (1893) as his best novel. He also wrote a biography of President Benjamin Harrison, a fellow Hoosier and Civil War general, and &quot;The Wooing of Malkatoon&quot; (1898), a narrative poem. Wallace was writing his autobiography when he died in 1905. His wife Susan completed it with the assistance of Mary Hannah Krout, another author from Crawfordsville. It was published posthumously in 1906.

==Later years==
Wallace continued to write after his return from the Ottoman Empire. He also patented several of his own inventions, built a seven-story apartment building in Indianapolis, the Blacherne, and drew up plans for a private study at his home in Crawfordsville. Wallace remained active in veterans groups, including writing a speech for the dedication of the battlefield at the Chickamauga.

Wallace&#x27;s elaborate writing study, which he described as &quot;a pleasure-house for my soul&quot;, served as his private retreat. Now called the General Lew Wallace Study and Museum, it was built between 1895 and 1898, adjacent to his residence in Crawfordsville, and set in an enclosed park. The study along with three and one-half acres of its grounds were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. The property is operated as a museum, open to the public. Wallace had a moat on two sides of the Study and stocked it so he could fish from the back porch and a landing. In winter, he would fire up the coal furnace in the Study basement and fish from the windows. He loved fishing so much he invented and patented a special traveler&#x27;s fishing pole. After just a few years he had the moat drained as it was negatively affecting the Study foundation and he worried about his grandchildren and neighborhood children falling into the water.

On April 5, 1898, at the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Wallace, at age seventy-one, offered to raise and lead a force of soldiers, but the war office refused. Undeterred, he went to a local recruiting office and attempted to enlist as a private, but was rejected again, presumably because of his age.

Wallace&#x27;s service at the battle of Shiloh continued to haunt him in later life. The debate persisted in book publications, magazine articles, pamphlets, speeches, and in private correspondence. Wallace attended a reunion at Shiloh in 1894, his first return since 1862, and retraced his journey to the battlefield with veterans from the 3rd Division. He returned to Shiloh for a final time in 1901 to walk the battlefield with David W. Reed, the Shiloh Battlefield Commission&#x27;s historian, and others. Wallace died before the manuscript of his memoirs was fully completed, and it is unknown whether he would have revised his final account of the battle.

==Death==
Wallace died at home in Crawfordsville, on February 15, 1905, of atrophic gastritis. He was seventy-seven years old. Wallace is buried in Crawfordsville Oak Hill Cemetery.

==Legacy and honors==

Wallace was a man of many interests and a lifelong adventure seeker, who remained a persistent, self-confident man of action. He was also impatient and highly sensitive to personal criticisms, especially those related to his command decisions at Shiloh. Despite Wallace&#x27;s career in law and politics, combined with years of military and diplomatic service, he achieved his greatest fame as a novelist, most notably for his best-selling biblical tale, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;.

Following Wallace&#x27;s death, the State of Indiana commissioned the sculptor Andrew O&#x27;Connor to create a marble statue of Wallace dressed in a military uniform for the National Statuary Hall Collection in the U.S. Capitol. The statue was unveiled during a ceremony held on January 11, 1910. Wallace is the only novelist honored in the hall. A bronze copy of the statue is installed on the grounds of Wallace&#x27;s study in Crawfordsville.

Lew Wallace High School opened in 1926 at 415 West 45th Avenue in Gary, Indiana. On June 3, 2014, the Gary School Board voted 4 to 2 to close Lew Wallace, along with five other schools.

A Knights of Pythias lodge was established in Franklin, Indiana at the Masonic Home to be known as the General Lewis Wallace Lodge #2019.

==Popular culture==
USL Indianapolis-based team The Indy Eleven pays homage to the 11th Regiment of Indiana Volunteers, which fought for the Union Army during the Civil War. The inspiration for the name came from Donna Schmink, the Collection Manager at the Indiana War Museum, who, when asked by team officials for ideas on a team name connected to Indiana history, suggested &quot;the Eleventh&quot; in honor of the regiment that valiantly fought under the initial direction of Colonel Lew Wallace.

<text>Vittorio Gassman (; born Gassmann; 1 September 1922 – 29 June 2000), popularly known as , was an Italian actor, director, and screenwriter.

He is considered one of the greatest Italian actors, whose career includes both important productions as well as dozens of &quot;divertissements&quot;.

==Early life==
Gassman was born in Genoa to a German father, Heinrich Gassmann (an engineer from Karlsruhe), and an Italian Jewish mother, Luisa Ambron, born in Pisa. While still very young, he moved to Rome, where he studied at the Silvio D&#x27;Amico National Academy of Dramatic Arts.

==Career==
Gassman&#x27;s debut was in Milan, in 1942, with Alda Borelli in Niccodemi&#x27;s &quot;La Nemica&quot; (theatre). He then moved to Rome and acted at the &quot;Teatro Eliseo&quot; joining Tino Carraro and Ernesto Calindri in a team that remained famous for some time; with them he acted in a range of plays from bourgeois comedy to sophisticated intellectual theatre. In 1946, he made his film debut in &quot;Preludio d&#x27;amore&quot;, while only one year later he appeared in five films. In 1948 he played in &quot;Riso amaro&quot;.

It was with Luchino Visconti&#x27;s company that Gassman achieved his mature successes, together with Paolo Stoppa, Rina Morelli and Paola Borboni. He played Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Un tram che si chiama desiderio&quot; (&quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;), as well as in &quot;Come vi piace&quot; (&quot;As You Like It&quot;) by Shakespeare and &quot;Oreste&quot; (by Vittorio Alfieri). He joined the &quot;Teatro Nazionale&quot; with Tommaso Salvini, Massimo Girotti, Arnoldo Foà to create a successful &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (by Henrik Ibsen). With Luigi Squarzina in 1952 he co-founded and co-directed the &quot;Teatro d&#x27;Arte Italiano&quot;, producing the first complete version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in Italy, followed by rare works such as Seneca&#x27;s &quot;Thyestes&quot; and Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;The Persians&quot;.


In 1956 Gassman played the title role in a production of &quot;Othello&quot;. He was so well received by his acting in the television series entitled &quot;&quot; that &quot;Il Mattatore&quot; became the nickname that accompanied him for the rest of his life. Gassman&#x27;s debut in the commedia all&#x27;italiana genre was rather accidental, in Mario Monicelli&#x27;s &quot;I soliti ignoti&quot; (&quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot;, 1958). Famous movies featuring Gassman include: &quot;Il sorpasso&quot; (1962), &quot;La Grande Guerra&quot; (1962), &quot;I mostri&quot; (1963), &quot;L&#x27;Armata Brancaleone&quot; (1966), &quot;Profumo di donna&quot; (1974) and &quot;C&#x27;eravamo tanto amati&quot; (1974).

He directed &quot;Adelchi&quot;, a lesser-known work by Alessandro Manzoni. Gassman brought this production to half a million spectators, crossing Italy with his &quot;Teatro Popolare Itinerante&quot; (a newer edition of the famous &quot;Carro di Tespi&quot;). His productions have included many of the famous authors and playwrights of the 20th century, with repeated returns to the classics of Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky and the Greek tragicians. He also founded a theatre school in Florence (Bottega Teatrale di Firenze), which educated many of the more talented actors of the current generation of Italian thespians.

In cinema, he worked frequently both in Italy and abroad. He met and fell in love with American actress Shelley Winters while she was touring Europe with fiancé Farley Granger. When Winters was forced to return to Hollywood to fulfill contractual obligations, he followed her there and married her. With his natural charisma and his fluency in English he scored a number of roles in Hollywood, including &quot;Rhapsody&quot; with Elizabeth Taylor and &quot;The Glass Wall&quot; before returning to Italy and the theatre.

In the 1990s he took part in the popular Italian Rai 3 TV show &quot;Tunnel&quot; in which he very formally and &quot;seriously&quot;&#x27; recited documents such as utility bills, yellow pages and similar trivial texts, such as washing instructions for a wool sweater or cookies ingredients. He rendered them with the same professional skill that made him famous while reciting Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.

In 1994, Gassman voiced Mufasa in the Italian dubbed version of &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Gassman&#x27;s voice was redubbed in several of his films by historical Italian actors and dubbers which include Emilio Cigoli, Sandro Ruffini, Gualtiero De Angelis, Stefano Sibaldi, Enrico Maria Salerno and Pino Locchi.

==Personal life==
Gassman married three times, all to actresses: Nora Ricci (with whom he had Paola, an actress and wife of Ugo Pagliai); Shelley Winters (mother of his daughter Vittoria); and (mother of his son Jacopo).

While rehearsing &quot;Hamlet&quot;, he began an affair with Anna Maria Ferrero, his 16-year-old Ophelia, which ended his marriage to Winters. He and Winters were forced to work together on &quot;Mambo&quot; just as their marriage was unraveling, providing fodder for tabloids all over the world.

From 1964 to 1968 he was the partner of French actress Juliette Mayniel (mother of his son Alessandro, also an actor). Through Alessandro, he is the grandfather of singer-songwriter Leo Gassmann.

Gassman suffered from bipolar disorder.

==Death==
On 29 June 2000, Gassman died of a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Rome at the age of 77. He was buried at Campo Verano.

<text>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or electroshock therapy (EST) is a psychiatric treatment during which a generalized seizure (without muscular convulsions) is electrically induced to manage refractory mental disorders. Typically, 70 to 120 volts are applied externally to the patient&#x27;s head, resulting in approximately 800 milliamperes of direct current passing between the electrodes, for a duration of 100 milliseconds to 6 seconds, either from temple to temple (bilateral ECT) or from front to back of one side of the head (unilateral ECT). However, only about 1% of the electrical current crosses the bony skull into the brain because skull impedance is about 100 times higher than skin impedance.

Aside from effects on the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia. Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and transient memory loss. Among treatments for severely depressed pregnant women, ECT is one of the least harmful to the fetus.

ECT is often used as an intervention for major depressive disorder, mania, autism, and catatonia. The usual course of ECT involves multiple administrations, typically given two or three times per week until the patient no longer has symptoms. ECT is administered under anesthesia with a muscle relaxant. ECT can differ in its application in three ways: electrode placement, treatment frequency, and the electrical waveform of the stimulus. These treatment parameters can pose significant differences in both adverse side effects and symptom remission in the treated patient.

Placement can be bilateral, where the electric current is passed from one side of the brain to the other, or unilateral, in which the current is solely passed across one hemisphere of the brain. High-dose unilateral ECT has some cognitive advantages compared to moderate-dose bilateral ECT while showing no difference in antidepressant efficacy.

== History==
As early as the 16th century, agents to induce seizures were used to treat psychiatric conditions. In 1785, the therapeutic use of seizure induction was documented in the &quot;London Medical and Surgical Journal&quot;. As to its earliest antecedents one doctor claims 1744 as the dawn of electricity&#x27;s therapeutic use, as documented in the first issue of &quot;Electricity and Medicine&quot;. Treatment and cure of hysterical blindness was documented eleven years later. Benjamin Franklin wrote that an electrostatic machine cured &quot;a woman of hysterical fits.&quot; By 1801, James Lind as well as Giovanni Aldini had used galvanism to treat patients with various mental disorders. G.B.C. Duchenne, the mid-19th century &quot;Father of Electrotherapy&quot;, said its use was integral to a neurological practice.

In the second half of the 19th century, such efforts were frequent enough in British asylums as to make it notable.

Convulsive therapy was introduced in 1934 by Hungarian neuropsychiatrist Ladislas J. Meduna who, believing mistakenly that schizophrenia and epilepsy were antagonistic disorders, induced seizures first with camphor and then metrazol (cardiazol). Meduna is thought to be the father of convulsive therapy. 

In 1937, the first international meeting on schizophrenia and convulsive therapy was held in Switzerland by the Swiss psychiatrist Max Müller. The proceedings were published in the &quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot; and, within three years, cardiazol convulsive therapy was being used worldwide. 

The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938 by Italian neuro-psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti and rapidly replaced less safe and effective forms of biological treatments in use at the time. Cerletti, who had been using electric shocks to produce seizures in animal experiments, and his assistant Lucio Bini at Sapienza University of Rome developed the idea of using electricity as a substitute for metrazol in convulsive therapy and, in 1938, experimented for the first time on a person affected by delusions. 

It was believed early on that inducing convulsions aided in helping those with severe schizophrenia but later found to be most useful with affective disorders such as depression. Cerletti had noted a shock to the head produced convulsions in dogs. The idea to use electroshock on humans came to Cerletti when he saw how pigs were given an electric shock before being butchered to put them in an anesthetized state. Cerletti and Bini practiced until they felt they had the right parameters needed to have a successful human trial. Once they started trials on patients, they found that after 10–20 treatments the results were significant. Patients had much improved. 

A positive side effect to the treatment was retrograde amnesia. It was because of this side effect that patients could not remember the treatments and had no ill feelings toward it. 

ECT soon replaced metrazol therapy all over the world because it was cheaper, less frightening and more convenient. Cerletti and Bini were nominated for a Nobel Prize but did not receive one. By 1940, the procedure was introduced to both England and the US. In Germany and Austria, it was promoted by Friedrich Meggendorfer. Through the 1940s and 1950s, the use of ECT became widespread. At the time the ECT device was patented and commercialized abroad, the two Italian inventors had competitive tensions that damaged their relationship. In the 1960s, despite a climate of condemnation, the original Cerletti-Bini ECT apparatus prototype was contended by scientific museums between Italy and the US. The ECT apparatus prototype is now owned and displayed by the Sapienza Museum of the History of Medicine in Rome.

In the early 1940s, in an attempt to reduce the memory disturbance and confusion associated with treatment, two modifications were introduced: the use of unilateral electrode placement and the replacement of sinusoidal current with brief pulse. It took many years for brief-pulse equipment to be widely adopted. 

In the 1940s and early 1950s, ECT was usually given in an &quot;unmodified&quot; form, without muscle relaxants, and the seizure resulted in a full-scale convulsion. A rare but serious complication of unmodified ECT was fracture or dislocation of the long bones. In the 1940s, psychiatrists began to experiment with curare, the muscle-paralysing South American poison, in order to modify the convulsions. The introduction of suxamethonium (succinylcholine), a safer synthetic alternative to curare, in 1951 led to the more widespread use of &quot;modified&quot; ECT. A short-acting anesthetic was usually given in addition to the muscle relaxant in order to spare patients the terrifying feeling of suffocation that can be experienced with muscle relaxants.

The steady growth of antidepressant use along with negative depictions of ECT in the mass media led to a marked decline in the use of ECT during the 1950s to the 1970s. The Surgeon General stated there were problems with electroshock therapy in the initial years before anesthesia was routinely given, and that &quot;these now-antiquated practices contributed to the negative portrayal of ECT in the popular media.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the public&#x27;s negative perception of ECT as being caused mainly by one movie: &quot;For Big Nurse in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest,&quot; it was a tool of terror, and, in the public mind, &quot;shock therapy&quot; has retained the tarnished image given it by Ken Kesey&#x27;s novel: dangerous, inhumane and overused&quot;.

In 1976, Dr. Blatchley demonstrated the effectiveness of his constant current, brief pulse device ECT. This device eventually largely replaced earlier devices because of the reduction in cognitive side effects, although as of 2012 some ECT clinics still were using sine-wave devices. 

The 1970s saw the publication of the first American Psychiatric Association (APA) task force report on electroconvulsive therapy (to be followed by further reports in 1990 and 2001). The report endorsed the use of ECT in the treatment of depression. The decade also saw criticism of ECT. Specifically, critics pointed to shortcomings such as noted side effects, the procedure being used as a form of abuse, and uneven application of ECT. The use of ECT declined until the 1980s, &quot;when use began to increase amid growing awareness of its benefits and cost-effectiveness for treating severe depression&quot;. In 1985, the National Institute of Mental Health and National Institutes of Health convened a consensus development conference on ECT and concluded that, while ECT was the most controversial treatment in psychiatry and had significant side-effects, it had been shown to be effective for a narrow range of severe psychiatric disorders.

Because of the backlash noted previously, national institutions reviewed past practices and set new standards. In 1978, the American Psychiatric Association released its first task force report in which new standards for consent were introduced and the use of unilateral electrode placement was recommended. The 1985 NIMH Consensus Conference confirmed the therapeutic role of ECT in certain circumstances. The American Psychiatric Association released its second task force report in 1990 where specific details on the delivery, education, and training of ECT were documented. Finally, in 2001 the American Psychiatric Association released its latest task force report. This report emphasizes the importance of informed consent, and the expanded role that the procedure has in modern medicine. By 2017, ECT was routinely covered by insurance companies for providing the &quot;biggest bang for the buck&quot; for otherwise intractable cases of severe mental illness, was receiving favorable media coverage, and was being provided in regional medical centers.

Though ECT use declined with the advent of modern antidepressants, there has been a resurgence of ECT with new modern technologies and techniques. Modern shock voltage is given for a shorter duration of 0.5 milliseconds where conventional brief pulse is 1.5 milliseconds.

In a review from 2022 of neuroimaging studies based on a global data collaboration ECT was suggested to work via a temporary disruption of neural circuits followed by augmented neuroplasticity and rewiring.

== Modern use ==
ECT is used, where possible, with informed consent in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, bipolar depression, treatment-resistant catatonia, prolonged or severe mania, and in conditions where &quot;there is a need for rapid, definitive response because of the severity of a psychiatric or medical condition (e.g., when illness is characterized by suicidality, psychosis, stupor, marked psychomotor retardation, depressive delusions or hallucinations, or life-threatening physical exhaustion associated with mania).&quot; It has also been used to treat autism in adults with an intellectual disability, yet findings from a systematic review found this an unestablished intervention.

===Major depressive disorder===
For major depressive disorder, despite a Canadian guideline and some experts arguing for using ECT as a first line treatment, ECT is generally used only when one or other treatments have failed, or in emergencies, such as imminent suicide. ECT has also been used in selected cases of depression occurring in the setting of multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Huntington&#x27;s chorea, developmental delay, brain arteriovenous malformations, and hydrocephalus.

====Efficacy====
A meta-analysis on the effectiveness of ECT in unipolar and bipolar depression indicated that although patients with unipolar depression and bipolar depression responded to other medical treatments very differently, both groups responded equally well to ECT. Overall remission rate for patients given a round of ECT treatment was 50.9% for those with unipolar depression and 53.2% for those with bipolar depression. Most severely depressed patients respond to ECT.

In 2004, a meta-analysis found in terms of efficacy, &quot;a significant superiority of ECT in all comparisons: ECT versus simulated ECT, ECT versus placebo, ECT versus antidepressants in general, ECT versus tricyclics and ECT versus monoamine oxidase inhibitors.&quot;

In 2003, The UK ECT Review Group published a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing ECT to placebo and antidepressant drugs. This meta-analysis demonstrated a large effect size (high efficacy relative to the mean in terms of the standard deviation) for ECT versus placebo, and versus antidepressant drugs.

Compared with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for people with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, ECT relieves depression as shown by reducing the score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression by about 15 points, while rTMS reduced it by 9 points.

Other estimates regarding the response rate in treatment resistant depression vary between 60–80%, with a remission rate of 50–60%. In addition to reducing symptoms of depression and inducing relapse, ECT has also been shown to reduce the risk of suicide, improve functional outcomes and quality of life as well as reduce the risk of re-hospitalization. Efficacy does not depend on depression subtype. With regards to treatment resistant schizophrenia, the response rate is 40–70%.

====Follow-up====
There is little agreement on the most appropriate follow-up to ECT for people with major depressive disorder. The initial course of ECT is then transitioned to maintenance ECT, pharmacotherapy or both. When ECT is stopped abruptly, without a bridge to maintenance ECT or medications (usually antidepressants and Lithium), it is associated with a relapse rate of 84%. There is no defined schedule for maintenance ECT, however it is usually started weekly with intervals extended permissibly with the goal of maintaining remission. When ECT is followed by treatment with antidepressants, about 50% of people relapsed by 12 months following successful initial treatment with ECT, with about 37% relapsing within the first 6 months. About twice as many relapsed with no antidepressants. Most of the evidence for continuation therapy is with tricyclic antidepressants; evidence for relapse prevention with newer antidepressants is lacking. Adjunct maintenance ECT paired with cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to reduce relapse rates. Maintenance ECT may safely continue indefinitely, with no set maximum treatment interval established.

Lithium has also been found to reduce the risk of relapse, especially in younger patients.

===Catatonia===
ECT is generally a second-line treatment for people with catatonia who do not respond to other treatments, but is a first-line treatment for severe or life-threatening catatonia. There is a plethora of evidence for its efficacy, notwithstanding a lack of randomised controlled trials, such that &quot;the excellent efficacy of ECT in catatonia is generally acknowledged&quot;. For people with autism spectrum disorders who have catatonia, there is little published evidence about the efficacy of ECT.

===Mania===
ECT is used to treat people who have severe or prolonged mania; NICE recommends it only in life-threatening situations or when other treatments have failed and as a second-line treatment for bipolar mania.

===Schizophrenia===
ECT is widely used worldwide in the treatment of schizophrenia, but in North America and Western Europe it is invariably used only in treatment resistant schizophrenia when symptoms show little response to antipsychotics; there is comprehensive research evidence for such practice. It is useful in the case of severe exacerbations of catatonic schizophrenia, whether excited or stuporous. There are also case reports of ECT improving persistent psychotic symptoms associated with stimulant-induced psychosis.

==Effects and adverse effects==
Aside from effects on the brain, the general risk for adverse effects stemming from ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia; a Surgeon General of the United States&#x27;s report stated that there are &quot;no absolute health contraindications&quot; to its use. Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and memory loss. Some patients experience muscle soreness after ECT. Other common adverse effects of ECT include headache, jaw soreness, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. These side effects are transient and respond to treatment. There is evidence and rationale to support giving low doses of benzodiazepines or lower doses of general anesthetics, which induce sedation but not unconsciousness, to patients to reduce the likelihood of adverse effects of ECT.

While there are no absolute contraindications for ECT, there is an increased risk for patients who have unstable or severe cardiovascular conditions or aneurysms; who have recently had a stroke; who have increased intracranial pressure (for instance, due to a solid brain tumor); who have severe pulmonary conditions; or who are generally at high risk for adverse effects from anesthesia.

In adolescents, ECT is highly efficient for several psychiatric disorders, with few and relatively benign adverse effects.

===Risk of death===
A meta-analysis from 2017 found that the death rate of ECT was around 2.1 per 100,000 procedures. A review from 2011 reported an estimated ECT mortality rate of fewer than one death per 73,440 treatments.

===Cognitive impairment===
Cognitive impairment sometimes occurs after ECT. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) report in 2001 acknowledged: &quot;In some patients the recovery from retrograde amnesia will be incomplete, and evidence has shown that ECT can result in persistent or permanent memory loss&quot;. It is the purported effects of ECT on long-term memory that give rise to much of the concern surrounding its use. However, the methods used to measure memory loss are non-specific, and their application to people with depressive disorders, who have cognitive deficits related to depression, including problems with memory, may further limit their utility.

The acute effects of ECT can include amnesia, both retrograde (for events occurring before the treatment) and anterograde (for events occurring after the treatment). Memory loss and confusion are more pronounced with bilateral electrode placement rather than unilateral and with outdated sine-wave rather than brief-pulse currents. Using either constant or pulsing electrical impulses also varied the memory loss results in patients. Patients who received pulsing electrical impulses, as opposed to a steady flow, seemed to incur less memory loss. The vast majority of modern treatments use brief pulse currents. A greater number of treatments and higher electrical charges (stimulus charges) have also been associated with a greater risk of memory impairment.

Retrograde amnesia is most marked for events occurring in the weeks or months before treatment. Anterograde memory loss usually resolves 2–4 weeks after treatment, whereas retrograde amnesia (which develops gradually after repeated treatments in the initial course) usually takes weeks to months to resolve; amnesia rarely persists for more than 1 year. Retrograde amnesia after ECT usually affects autobiographical memory rather than semantic memory. One published review summarizing the results of questionnaires about subjective memory loss found that between 29% and 55% of respondents believed they experienced long-lasting or permanent memory changes. In 2000, American psychiatrist Sarah Lisanby and colleagues found that bilateral ECT left patients with more persistently impaired memory of public events as compared to right unilateral ECT. However, bilateral ECT may be more efficacious than unilateral in the treatment of mood disorders.

ECT has not been found to increase the risk of dementia or cause structural brain damage.

===Effects on brain structure===
Considerable controversy exists over the effects of ECT on brain tissue, although a number of mental health associations—including the APA—have concluded that there is no evidence that ECT causes structural brain damage. A 1999 report by the US Surgeon General states: &quot;The fears that ECT causes gross structural brain pathology have not been supported by decades of methodologically sound research in both humans and animals.&quot;

Many expert proponents of ECT maintain that the procedure is safe and does not cause brain damage. Dr. Charles Kellner, a prominent ECT researcher and former chief editor of the &quot;Journal of ECT&quot;, stated in a 2007 interview that, &quot;There are a number of well-designed studies that show ECT does not cause brain damage and numerous reports of patients who have received a large number of treatments over their lifetime and have suffered no significant problems due to ECT.&quot; Kellner cites a study purporting to show an absence of cognitive impairment in eight subjects after more than 100 lifetime ECT treatments. Kellner stated, &quot;Rather than cause brain damage, there is evidence that ECT may reverse some of the damaging effects of serious psychiatric illness.&quot; Two meta-analyses find that ECT is associated with brain matter growth.

===Effects in pregnancy===
If steps are taken to decrease potential risks, ECT is generally considered relatively safe during all trimesters of pregnancy, particularly when compared to pharmacological treatments. Suggested preparation for ECT during pregnancy includes a pelvic examination, discontinuation of nonessential anticholinergic medication, uterine tocodynamometry, intravenous hydration, and administration of a nonparticulate antacid. During ECT, elevation of the pregnant woman&#x27;s right hip, external fetal cardiac monitoring, intubation, and avoidance of excessive hyperventilation are recommended. In many instances of active mood disorder during pregnancy, the risks of untreated symptoms may outweigh the risks of ECT. Modifications in technique can minimize potential complications of ECT during pregnancy. The use of ECT during pregnancy requires a thorough evaluation of the patient&#x27;s capacity for informed consent.

===Effects on the heart===
ECT can cause a lack of blood flow and oxygen to the heart, heart arrhythmia, and &quot;persistent asystole&quot;. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis of 82 studies found that the rate of major adverse cardiac events with ECT was 1 in 39 patients or about 1 in 200 to 500 procedures. The risk of death with ECT however is low. If death does occur, cardiovascular complications are considered as causal in about 30% of individuals.

== Procedure ==

The placement of electrodes, as well as the dose and duration of the stimulation is determined on a per-patient basis.

In unilateral ECT, both electrodes are placed on the same side of the patient&#x27;s head. Unilateral ECT may be used first to minimize side effects such as memory loss.

In bilateral ECT, the two electrodes are placed on opposite sides of the head. Usually bitemporal placement is used, whereby the electrodes are placed on the temples. Uncommonly bifrontal placement is used; this involves positioning the electrodes on the patient&#x27;s forehead, roughly above each eye.

Unilateral ECT is thought to cause fewer cognitive effects than bilateral treatment, but is less effective unless administered at higher doses. Most patients in the US and almost all in the UK receive bilateral ECT.

The electrodes deliver an electrical stimulus. The stimulus levels recommended for ECT are in excess of an individual&#x27;s seizure threshold: about one and a half times seizure threshold for bilateral ECT and up to 12 times for unilateral ECT. Below these levels treatment may not be effective in spite of a seizure, while doses massively above threshold level, especially with bilateral ECT, expose patients to the risk of more severe cognitive impairment without additional therapeutic gains. Seizure threshold is determined by trial and error (&quot;dose titration&quot;). Some psychiatrists use dose titration, some still use &quot;fixed dose&quot; (that is, all patients are given the same dose) and others compromise by roughly estimating a patient&#x27;s threshold according to age and sex. Older men tend to have higher thresholds than younger women, but it is not a hard and fast rule, and other factors, for example drugs, affect seizure threshold.

Immediately prior to treatment, a patient is given a short-acting anesthetic such as methohexital, propofol, etomidate, or thiopental, a muscle relaxant such as suxamethonium (succinylcholine), and occasionally atropine to inhibit salivation. Studies have shown that adding ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, to the anesthesia regimen produced greater decreases in depression scores when compared to propofol, methohexital, and thiopental alone. In a minority of countries such as Japan, India, and Nigeria, ECT may be used without anesthesia. The Union Health Ministry of India recommended a ban on ECT without anesthesia in India&#x27;s Mental Health Care Bill of 2010 and the Mental Health Care Bill of 2013. The practice was abolished in Turkey&#x27;s largest psychiatric hospital in 2008.

The patient&#x27;s EEG, ECG, and blood oxygen levels are monitored during treatment.

ECT is usually administered three times a week, on alternate days, over a course of two to four weeks.
===Neuroimaging prior to ECT===
Neuroimaging prior to ECT may be useful for detecting intracranial pressure or mass given that patients respond less when one of these conditions exist. Nonetheless, it is not indicated due to high cost and low prevalence of these conditions in patients needing ECT.

=== Concurrent pharmacotherapy ===
Whether psychiatric medications are terminated prior to treatment or maintained, varies. However, drugs that are known to cause toxicity in combination with ECT, such as lithium, are discontinued, and benzodiazepines, which increase the seizure threshold, are either discontinued, a benzodiazepine antagonist is administered at each ECT session, or the ECT treatment is adjusted accordingly.

A 2009 RCT provides some evidence indicating that concurrent use of some antidepressant improves ECT efficacy.

=== Course ===
ECT is usually done from 6 to 12 times in 2 to 4 weeks but can sometimes exceed 12 rounds. It is also recommended to not do ECT more than 3 times per week. Evidence suggest that ECTs for depression may be stopped if there is no improvement during the first six sessions.

=== Treatment team ===

In the US, the medical team performing the procedure typically consists of a psychiatrist, an anesthetist, an ECT treatment nurse or qualified assistant, and one or more recovery nurses. Medical trainees may assist, but only under the direct supervision of credentialed attending physicians and staff.

=== Devices ===

Most modern ECT devices deliver a brief-pulse current, which is thought to cause fewer cognitive effects than the sine-wave currents which were originally used in ECT. A small minority of psychiatrists in the US still use sine-wave stimuli. Sine-wave is no longer used in the UK or Ireland.
Typically, the electrical stimulus used in ECT is about 800 milliamps and has up to several hundred watts, and the current flows for between one and six seconds.

In the US, ECT devices are manufactured by two companies, Somatics, which is owned by psychiatrists Richard Abrams and Conrad Swartz, and Mecta. In the UK, the market for ECT devices was long monopolized by Ectron Ltd, which was set up by psychiatrist Robert Russell.

== Mechanism of action ==
Despite decades of research, the exact mechanism of action of ECT remains elusive. A review from 2022 of neuroimaging studies based on a global data collaboration resulted in a model of temporary disruption of neural circuits followed by augmented neuroplasticity and rewiring. Other brain changes observed after ECT include increased gray matter volume in the frontolimbic areas including the hippocampus and amygdala, increased white matter tracts in the frontal and temporal lobes, increased monoamine neurotransmitters and increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Changes in sleep architecture due to the induced seizures have also been hypothesized as a mechanism of action.

==Use==
As of 2001, it was estimated that about one million people received ECT annually.

There is wide variation in ECT use between different countries, different hospitals, and different psychiatrists. International practice varies considerably from widespread use of the therapy in many Western countries to a small minority of countries that do not use ECT at all, such as Slovenia.

About 70 percent of ECT patients are women. This may be because women are more likely to be diagnosed with depression. Older and more affluent patients are also more likely to receive ECT. The use of ECT is not as common in ethnic minorities.

In Sweden, which has a complete register of all ECT treatments in the country, in 2013 the rate of persons treated in that year per 100,000 inhabitants was 41. Almost the same rate had already been present in 1975 with 42 patients per 100,000 inhabitants.

=== United States ===
ECT became popular in the US in the 1940s. At the time, psychiatric hospitals were overrun with patients whom doctors were desperate to treat and cure. Whereas lobotomies would reduce a patient to a more manageable submissive state, ECT helped to improve mood in those with severe depression. A survey of psychiatric practice in the late 1980s found that an estimated 100,000 people received ECT annually, with wide variation between metropolitan statistical areas.

Accurate statistics about the frequency, context and circumstances of ECT in the US are difficult to obtain because only a few states have reporting laws that require the treating facility to supply state authorities with this information. In 13 of the 50 states, the practice of ECT is regulated by law.

In the mid-1990s in Texas, ECT was used in about one third of psychiatric facilities and given to about 1,650 people annually.
Usage of ECT has since declined slightly; in 2000–01 ECT was given to about 1,500 people aged from 16 to 97 (in Texas it is illegal to give ECT to anyone under sixteen). ECT is more commonly used in private psychiatric hospitals than in public hospitals, and minority patients are underrepresented in the ECT statistics.

In the United States, ECT is usually given three times a week; in the United Kingdom, it is usually given twice a week. Occasionally it is given on a daily basis. A course usually consists of 6–12 treatments, but may be more or fewer. Following a course of ECT some patients may be given continuation or maintenance ECT with further treatments at weekly, fortnightly or monthly intervals. A few psychiatrists in the US use multiple-monitored ECT (MMECT), where patients receive more than one treatment per anesthetic. Electroconvulsive therapy is not a required subject in US medical schools and not a required skill in psychiatric residency training. Privileging for ECT practice at institutions is a local option: no national certification standards are established, and no ECT-specific continuing training experiences are required of ECT practitioners.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK in 1980, an estimated 50,000 people received ECT annually, with use declining steadily since then to about 12,000 per annum in 2002. It is still used in nearly all psychiatric hospitals, with a survey of ECT use from 2002 finding that 71 percent of patients were women and 46 percent were over 65 years of age. Eighty-one percent had a diagnosis of mood disorder; schizophrenia was the next most common diagnosis. Sixteen percent were treated without their consent. In 2003, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a government body which was set up to standardize treatment throughout the National Health Service in England and Wales, issued guidance on the use of ECT. Its use was recommended &quot;only to achieve rapid and short-term improvement of severe symptoms after an adequate trial of treatment options has proven ineffective and/or when the condition is considered to be potentially life-threatening in individuals with severe depressive illness, catatonia or a prolonged manic episode&quot;.

The guidance received a mixed reception. It was welcomed by an editorial in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; but the Royal College of Psychiatrists launched an unsuccessful appeal. The NICE guidance, as the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; editorial points out, is only a policy statement and psychiatrists may deviate from it if they see fit. Adherence to standards has not been universal in the past. A survey of ECT use in 1980 found that more than half of ECT clinics failed to meet minimum standards set by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, with a later survey in 1998 finding that minimum standards were largely adhered to, but that two-thirds of clinics still fell short of current guidelines, particularly in the training and supervision of junior doctors involved in the procedure. A voluntary accreditation scheme, ECTAS, was set up in 2004 by the Royal College, and the vast majority of ECT clinics in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have signed up.

The Mental Health Act 2007 allows people to be treated against their will. This law has extra protections regarding ECT. A patient capable of making the decision can decline the treatment, and in that case treatment cannot be given unless it will save that patient&#x27;s life or is immediately necessary to prevent deterioration of the patient&#x27;s condition. A patient may not be capable of making the decision (they &quot;lack capacity&quot;), and in that situation ECT can be given if it is appropriate and also if there are no advance directives that prevent the use of ECT.

===China===
ECT was introduced in China in the early 1950s and while it was originally practiced without anesthesia, as of 2012 almost all procedures were conducted with it. As of 2012, there are approximately 400 ECT machines in China, and 150,000 ECT treatments are performed each year. Chinese national practice guidelines recommend ECT for the treatment of schizophrenia, depressive disorders, and bipolar disorder and in the Chinese literature, ECT is an effective treatment for schizophrenia and mood disorders.

Although the Chinese government stopped classifying homosexuality as an illness in 2001, electroconvulsive therapy is still used by some establishments as a form of &quot;conversion therapy&quot;. Alleged Internet addiction (or general unruliness) in adolescents is also known to have been treated with ECT, sometimes without anestheia, most notably by Yang Yongxin. The practice was banned in 2009 after news on Yang broke out.

==Society and culture==
===Controversy===
Surveys of public opinion, the testimony of former patients, legal restrictions on the use of ECT and disputes as to the efficacy, ethics and adverse effects of ECT within the psychiatric and wider medical community indicate that the use of ECT remains controversial. This is reflected in the January 2011 vote by the FDA&#x27;s Neurological Devices Advisory Panel to recommend that FDA maintain ECT devices in the Class III device category for high risk devices, except for patients with catatonia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. This may result in the manufacturers of such devices having to do controlled trials on their safety and efficacy for the first time. In justifying their position, panelists referred to the memory loss associated with ECT and the lack of long-term data.

=== Legal status ===

==== Informed consent ====
The World Health Organization (2005) advises that ECT should be used only with the informed consent of the patient (or their guardian if their incapacity to consent has been established).

In the US, this doctrine places a legal obligation on a doctor to make a patient aware of the reason for treatment, the risks and benefits of a proposed treatment, the risks and benefits of alternative treatment, and the risks and benefits of receiving no treatment. The patient is then given the opportunity to accept or reject the treatment. The form states how many treatments are recommended and also makes the patient aware that consent may be revoked and treatment discontinued at any time during a course of ECT. The US Surgeon General&#x27;s Report on Mental Health states that patients should be warned that the benefits of ECT are short-lived without active continuation treatment in the form of drugs or further ECT, and that there may be some risk of permanent, severe memory loss after ECT. The report advises psychiatrists to involve patients in discussion, possibly with the aid of leaflets or videos, both before and during a course of ECT.

According to the US Surgeon General, involuntary treatment is uncommon in the US and is typically used only in cases of great extremity, and only when all other treatment options have been exhausted. The use of ECT is believed to be a potentially life-saving treatment.

In one of the few jurisdictions where recent statistics on ECT usage are available, a national audit of ECT by the Scottish ECT Accreditation Network indicated that 77% of patients who received the treatment in 2008 were capable of giving informed consent.

In the UK, in order for consent to be valid it requires an explanation in &quot;broad terms&quot; of the nature of the procedure and its likely effects. One review from 2005 found that only about half of patients felt they were given sufficient information about ECT and its adverse effects and another survey found that about fifty percent of psychiatrists and nurses agreed with them.

A 2005 study published in the &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot; described patients&#x27; perspectives on the adequacy of informed consent before ECT. The study found that &quot;About half (45–55%) of patients reported they were given an adequate explanation of ECT, implying a similar percentage felt they were not.&quot; The authors also stated:

==== Involuntary ECT ====
Procedures for involuntary ECT vary from country to country depending on local mental health laws.

=====United States=====
In most states in the US, a judicial order following a formal hearing is needed before a patient can be forced to undergo involuntary ECT. However, ECT can also be involuntarily administered in situations with less immediate danger. Suicidal intent is a common justification for its involuntary use, especially when other treatments are ineffective.

In 2007, a psychiatric patient in the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in New York, given the pseudonym of Simone D., won a court ruling which set aside a two-year-old court order to give her electroshock treatment against her will.

=====United Kingdom=====
Until 2007 in England and Wales, the Mental Health Act 1983 allowed the use of ECT on detained patients whether or not they had capacity to consent to it. However, following amendments which took effect in 2007, ECT may not generally be given to a patient who has capacity and refuses it, irrespective of his or her detention under the Act. In fact, even if a patient is deemed to lack capacity, if they made a valid advance decision refusing ECT then they should not be given it; and even if they do not have an advance decision, the psychiatrist must obtain an independent second opinion (which is also the case if the patient is under age of consent). However, there is an exception regardless of consent and capacity; under Section 62 of the Act, if the treating psychiatrist says the need for treatment is urgent they may start a course of ECT without authorization. From 2003 to 2005, about 2,000 people a year in England and Wales were treated without their consent under the Mental Health Act. Concerns have been raised by the official regulator that psychiatrists are too readily assuming that patients have the capacity to consent to their treatments, and that there is a worrying lack of independent advocacy. In Scotland, the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 also gives patients with capacity the right to refuse ECT.

==== Regulation ====
In the US, ECT devices came into existence prior to medical devices being regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. In 1976, the Medical Device Regulation Act required the FDA to retrospectively review already existing devices, classify them, and determine whether clinical trials were needed to prove efficacy and safety. The FDA initially classified the devices used to administer ECT as Class III medical devices. In 2014, the American Psychiatric Association petitioned the FDA to reclassify ECT devices from Class III (high-risk) to Class II (medium-risk). A similar reclassification proposal in 2010 did not pass. In 2018, the FDA re-classified ECT devices as Class II devices when used to treat catatonia or a severe major depressive episode associated with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder.

==== By country ====

===== Australia =====
In Western Australia, ECT has been heavily restricted since 2014, after a bill passed with bipartisan support introducing restrictions on ECT, which were welcomed by mental health experts. Children under 14 are prohibited from receiving ECT, while those aged 14 to 18 must have informed consent approval from the Mental Health Tribunal. The law imposes a $15,000 fine on anyone who performs ECT on a child under the age of 14.

Similarly, ECT is also banned on children under the age of 12 in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).

===== United States =====
Many mental health facilities offer ECT for specific diagnoses, such as chronic depression, mania, catatonia and schizophrenia. However, ECT is often only used as a treatment of last resort. To be considered for ECT, often testing such as an EKG and lab tests are required, in addition to a physical and neurological exam. Certain medications and conditions, such as cardiac conditions or hypertension, may disqualify a patient from ECT. Patients should give proper informed consent before ECT is performed. In the United States, ECT is performed under general anesthesia. Both trained health professionals with experience in ECT administration as well as a specifically trained and certified anesthesiologist should administer the procedure and anesthesia respectively.

=== Public perception ===
A questionnaire survey of 379 members of the general public in Australia indicated that more than 60% of respondents had some knowledge about the main aspects of ECT. Participants were generally opposed to the use of ECT on depressed individuals with psychosocial issues, on children, and on involuntary patients. Public perceptions of ECT were found to be mainly negative. A sample of the general public, medical students, and psychiatry trainees in the United Kingdom found that the psychiatry trainees were more knowledgeable and had more favorable opinions of ECT than did the other groups. More members of the general public believed that ECT was used for control or punishment purposes than medical students or psychiatry trainees.

===Famous cases===
* Ernest Hemingway, an American author, died by suicide in 1961 half a year after ECT treatment at the Mayo Clinic in 1960. He is reported to have said to his biographer, &quot;Well, what is the sense of ruining my head and erasing my memory, which is my capital, and putting me out of business? It was a brilliant cure but we lost the patient.&quot; However, the same biographer (Hotchner, 1966) and also a second biographer (Lynn, 1987) emphasized - according to a review from 2008 - &quot;that Hemingway’s serious mental illness and plans for suicide significantly predated his ECT treatments.&quot;
* Robert Pirsig had a nervous breakdown and spent time in and out of psychiatric hospitals between 1961 and 1963. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and clinical depression as a result of an evaluation conducted by psychoanalysts, and was treated with electroconvulsive therapy on numerous occasions, a treatment he discusses in his novel, &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;.
* Thomas Eagleton, United States Senator from Missouri, was dropped from the Democratic ticket in the 1972 United States Presidential Election as the party&#x27;s vice presidential candidate after it was revealed that he had received electroshock treatment in the past for depression. Presidential nominee George McGovern replaced him with Sargent Shriver, and later went on to lose by a landslide to Richard Nixon.
* American surgeon and award-winning author Sherwin B. Nuland is another notable person who has undergone ECT. In his 40s, his depression became so severe that he had to be institutionalized. After exhausting all treatment options, a young resident assigned to his case suggested ECT, which was successful.
* Author David Foster Wallace also received ECT for many years, beginning as a teenager, before his suicide at age 46.
* New Zealand author Janet Frame experienced both insulin coma therapy and ECT (but without the use of anesthesia or muscle relaxants). She wrote about this in her autobiography, &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot; (1984), which was later adapted into a film (1990).
* American actor Carrie Fisher wrote about her experience with memory loss after ECT treatments in her memoir &quot;Wishful Drinking.&quot;
* Lou Reed had ECT as a teenager to &quot;cure&quot; his homosexuality. He later claimed it had induced multiple personality disorder, and resulted in his hatred of psychiatrists. After Reed&#x27;s death, his sister denied the ECT treatments were intended to suppress his &quot;homosexual urges&quot;, asserting that their parents were not homophobic but had been told by his doctors that ECT was necessary to treat Reed&#x27;s mental and behavioral issues.
* On October 31, 2024, a Chinese transgender woman was approved by Changli county people’s court in Qinhuangdao to receive 60,000 yuan (£6,552) in compensation from a hospital that gave her electroshock conversion treatment against her will. This was the first time any transgender person in China won a legal challenge against the use of electroshock conversion treatment.

===Fictional examples===
Electroconvulsive therapy has been depicted in fiction, including fictional works partly based on true experiences. These include Sylvia Plath&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, Ken Loach&#x27;s film &quot;Family Life&quot;, and Ken Kesey&#x27;s novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;; Kesey&#x27;s novel is a direct product of his time working the graveyard shift as an orderly at a mental health facility in Menlo Park, California.

Two analyses of large numbers of films using ECT scenes found that almost all presented fictional settings that were unrelated to real treatment routines and were apparently aimed at stigmatizing ECT as a tool of repression and of mind and behavior control - having effects of memory-erosion, pain and damage.

The song “The Mind Electric” by Miracle Musical is typically interpreted as depicting someone undergoing ECT.

In the television series &quot;Mr Bates vs The Post Office&quot;, which is based on true events, the character of Saman Kaur receives ECT following a deep depression and attempted suicide.

<text> ( , ) is a Latin phrase that means &quot;of its/their own kind&quot; or &quot;in a class by itself&quot;, therefore &quot;unique&quot;.

Several disciplines use the term to refer to unique entities. These include:
* Biology, for species that do not fit into a genus that includes other species (its own genus)
* Creative arts, for artistic works that go beyond conventional genre boundaries (its own genre)
* Law, when a special and unique interpretation of a case or authority is necessary (its own special case)
** Intellectual property rights, for types of works not falling under general copyright law but protected through separate statutes
* Philosophy, to indicate an idea, an entity, or a reality that cannot be reduced to a lower concept or included in a higher concept (its own category)

==Biology==

In the taxonomical structure &quot;genus → species&quot;, a species is described as if its genus was created to classify it (i.e., its uniqueness at the time of classification merited the creation of a new genus, the sole member of which was initially the species). A species that is the sole &quot;extant&quot; member of its genus (e.g., the genus &quot;Homo&quot;) is not necessarily ; extinctions may have eliminated other congeneric species. A &quot;sui generis&quot; genus may also be called a monotypic genus.

==Creative arts==
A book, movie, television series, or other artistic creation is called when it does not fit into standard genre boundaries. Movie critic Richard Schickel identifies&quot; Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; as a movie. Film critic Michael Brooke used the term to describe &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot;, a 1973 Franco-Czech sci-fi animated film directed by René Laloux.

==Law==
In law, it is a term of art used to identify a legal classification that exists independently of other categorizations, either because of its singularity or due to the specific creation of an entitlement or obligation. For example, a court&#x27;s contempt powers arise&quot; sui generis&quot; and not from statute or rule. The New York Court of Appeals has used the term in describing cooperative apartment corporations, mostly because this form of housing is considered real property for some purposes and personal property for other purposes.

When citing cases and other authorities, lawyers and judges may refer to &quot;a case&quot;, or &quot;a authority&quot;, meaning it is a special one confined to &quot;its own&quot; facts and, therefore, may not be of broader application.

===Intellectual property law===
Generally speaking, protection for intellectual property extends to intellectual creations to incentivize innovation and depends upon the nature of the work and its &quot;characteristics&quot;. The main types of intellectual property law are: copyright, which protects creative works; patent, which protects invention; trade secret, which protects information not generally known or readily ascertainable that is valuable to the secret holder; and trademark, which protects branding and other exclusive properties of products and services. Any matter that meets these criteria can be protected.

 statutes exist in many countries that extend intellectual property protection to matter that does not meet characteristic definitions. For example, integrated circuit layouts, ship hull designs, fashion designs in France, databases, and plant varieties require statutes because of their unique characteristics. The United States, Japan, Australia, and many EU countries protect the topography of semiconductor chips and integrated circuits under &quot;sui generis&quot; laws, which borrow some aspects from patent or copyright law. In the U.S., this law is known as the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984.

===Statutory law===

In statutory interpretation, &quot;sui generis&quot; refers to the problem of giving meaning to groups of words where one of the words is ambiguous or inherently unclear.

In road traffic law, a statute may require consideration of large vehicles separately from other vehicles. The word &quot;large&quot; is ambiguous &quot;per se&quot; but may be considered &quot;heavy&quot;. The relevant legislation (in Australian law) contain sections called &quot;Terms used&quot; or &quot;Definitions&quot; that itemise all words deemed ambiguous and confers specific interpretations consistent with natural language. One indicates &quot;heavy vehicle&quot; means a vehicle with a GVM over 4.5 tons, and GVM means &quot;gross vehicle mass&quot;, the maximum loaded mass of the vehicle. Further explanations cover various contingencies. Thus, &quot;large&quot; is equivalent to &quot;heavy&quot; and is (for this unique case) clearly defined &quot;sui generis&quot;.

In U.S. attorney admissions, an applicant for admission to the practice of law may be referred to the state committee on character and fitness, where proceedings are &quot;neither civil nor criminal, but are sui generis&quot;.

===Town planning law===
In town and country planning in the United Kingdom, in particular, relating to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, many common types of land use are categorised into specific &quot;use classes&quot;. Change of use of land within a use class does not require planning permission; changing between use classes might require planning permission, and approval is always needed if the new use is .

Examples of uses include embassies, theatres, amusement arcades, laundrettes, taxi or vehicle hire businesses, petrol filling stations, scrapyards, nightclubs, motor car showrooms, retail warehouses, clubs and hostels.
As of 1 September 2020 following the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020, the following uses were added as sui generis:

* public houses, wine bars, or drinking establishments (&quot;previously Class A4&quot;)
* drinking establishments with expanded food provision (&quot;previously Class A4&quot;)
* hot food takeaways (&quot;previously Class A5&quot;)
* venues for live music performance
* cinemas (&quot;previously Class D2(a)&quot;)
* concert halls (&quot;previously D2(b)&quot;)
* bingo halls (&quot;previously D2(c)&quot;)
* dance halls (&quot;previously D2(d)&quot;)

The grant of private hire vehicle (taxicab) operators licences by local authorities frequently has a condition that the appropriate &quot;sui generis&quot; change of use planning permission is granted to those premises to ensure those businesses cannot trade lawfully without the relevant planning consent.

=== International law ===
When applied to international law, &quot;&quot; refers to situations which are distinct and thus not easily categorized under existing legal frameworks or conventions. in international law may suggest novel legal frameworks to address unprecedented issues using a new set of legal principles. For example, the legal status of the internet or space law.
&quot;Sui generis&quot; systems can be crucial in international law because they allow the international community to develop adaptive legal responses to emerging global challenges and contexts that are not adequately addressed by traditional international law. They often also serve as precursors to the evolution of wider customary international law or the development of new treaties and conventions. The uniqueness of legal regimes can sometimes make them challenging to interpret, enforce, or harmonize with existing legal frameworks.

==Philosophy==
Analytic philosophy often uses the expression to indicate an idea, an entity, or a reality that cannot be reduced to a lower concept or included in a higher concept. G. E. Moore, for example, refuted reductive ethical naturalism in moral theories like utilitarianism by arguing that moral properties (like good or bad) could not be reduced to or equated with non-moral properties (like pleasure) because moral properties are sui generis. This can be seen in Moore&#x27;s open-question argument.

==Politics and society==
In political philosophy, the unparalleled development of the European Union as compared with other international organizations has led to its designation as a geopolitical entity. The legal nature of the EU is widely debated because its mixture of intergovernmental and supranational elements causes it to share characteristics with both confederal and federal entities. It is generally considered more than a confederation but less than a federation, thus being appropriately classified as an instance of neither political form. Compared to other international organizations, the EU is often considered &quot;sui generis&quot; because its legal system comprehensively rejects any use of retaliatory sanctions by one member state against another.

A similar case that led to the use of the label is the relationship of New Caledonia relative to France because the legal status of New Caledonia can aptly be said to lie somewhere between a French overseas collectivity and a sovereign nation. Although other examples of such status for further dependent or disputed territories may exist, this arrangement is unique within the French realm.

The legal status of the Holy See is also described as a entity possessing an international personality. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta has likewise been described as a &quot; primary subject of public international law&quot;. Another entity widely considered to have &quot;sui generis&quot; international legal personality is the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In local government, a entity does not fit with a country&#x27;s general scheme of local governance. For example, in England, the City of London and the Isles of Scilly are the two &quot;sui generis&quot; localities, as their forms of local government are both (for historical or geographical reasons) very different from those of elsewhere in the country. 
In a press conference during which reporters were trying to analyse his political personality, Huey Long said &quot;say that I am &quot;sui generis&quot;, and let it go at that&quot;.

The Joint Council of Municipalities in Croatia is a council of municipalities in the east of the country that was formed after the Erdut Agreement and UNTAES mission aimed at protection of the rights of the ethnic Serb community in the region and is, as such, a unique form of local cooperation and minority self-government in Croatia.

=== Sociology ===
In sociology, methodological holists argue that social phenomena exist in their own right (sui generis) and are not reducible to the actions of individuals. For example, Emile Durkheim argued that the suicide rate was a social phenomenon sui generis (existing over and above the actions of individuals) In a social constructionist perspective, &quot; is what has been externalized, then internalized in the overall public and becomes a part of society that exists in its construct. It is not something that is not thought to have been created because it is embedded in everyone&#x27;s way of thinking and being. Instances include love, going to school, or clothing belonging to a specific gender. These examples are &quot;sui generis&quot; for they exist in society and are widely accepted without thoughts of where they come from or how they were created.

<doc id="44096" wikidata="Q101075" url="?curid=44096" title="Hans von Bodeck">
<text>Hans von Bodeck (1582 – 23 June 1658) was a Prussian diplomat and chancellor of the Hohenzollern Prince-electors of Brandenburg-Prussia.

==Biography==
Bodeck came from a prominent patrician family of Elbing (Elbląg) in the Polish province of Royal Prussia. His grandfather was the burgomaster, while his father was a city councilman. His ancestor Johann III von Bodeck (1542–1595) received imperial status from Emperor Rudolf II and was allowed to improve the family&#x27;s coat of arms. The family also held offices in Danzig (Gdańsk).

In order to find a trading partner Bodeck was sent on a diplomatic mission from Elbing throughout Europe. During that time he wrote &quot;liber amicorum&quot;, which is now studied by musicologists. During his diplomatic tour Bodeck visited the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, and England, where he attended the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. He attended the funeral ceremony for Queen Elizabeth I of England and the coronation of the new English king, James I. The council of Elbing had sent two delegates with dual missions: firstly, to pay its respects to the new king and secondly to oppose the transfer of English trade from Elbing to nearby Danzig.

In 1604 Bodeck left for London and met John Dowland, Philip Rosseter, and Thomas Campion. All three composers of lute songs lived in the same district of London. Bodeck befriended them, and Campion wrote a song dedicated to Bodeck. Many people from England and Scotland came to live in Elbling.

Later that year Bodeck left for Paris and met Count Christopher von Dohna, a nobleman of Prussia, who lived 15 km from Elbing. Bodeck then became the chancellor to Elector Joachim Frederick of Brandenburg. He died in 1658 in Hamburg.

A collection of pieces for lute was purchased by Dohna and kept at the Elbing library. In 1929 Hans Bauer wrote a full description of the register of Bodeck. During the capture of Elbing by the Soviet Red Army in 1945 during World War II and the subsequent expulsion of the city&#x27;s German populace, the library was destroyed. Many Prussian documents and original manuscripts have since been discovered in Kraków, leading music researchers to hope that some of Bodeck&#x27;s works might resurface.

<doc id="44101" wikidata="Q325261" url="?curid=44101" title="Satellite state">
<text>A satellite state or dependent state is a country that is formally independent but under heavy political, economic, and military influence or control from another country. The term was coined by analogy to planetary objects orbiting a larger object, such as smaller moons revolving around larger planets, and is used mainly to refer to Central and Eastern European member states of the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War, as well as to Mongolia and Tuva between 1924 and 1990, all of which were economically, culturally, and politically dominated by the Soviet Union. While primarily referring to the Soviet-controlled states in Central and Eastern Europe or Asia, in some contexts the term also refers to other countries under Soviet hegemony during the Cold War, such as North Korea (especially in the years surrounding the Korean War of 1950–1953), Cuba (particularly after it joined the Comecon in 1972), and some countries in the American sphere of influence, such as South Vietnam (particularly during the Vietnam War). In Western usage, the term has seldom been applied to states other than those in the Soviet orbit. In Soviet usage, the term applied to states in the orbit of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan, whereas in the West the term to refer to those has typically been &quot;client states&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; traces the concept of satellite states in English back as early as 1780. In times of war or political tension, satellite states sometimes served as buffers between an enemy country and the nation exerting control over the satellites.
==Soviet satellite states==
===Interwar period===
When the Mongolian Revolution of 1921 broke out, Mongolian revolutionaries expelled the Russian White Guards (during the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923 following the October Revolution of 1917) from Mongolia, with the assistance of the Soviet Red Army. The revolution also officially ended Manchurian sovereignty over Mongolia, which had existed since 1691. Although the theocratic Bogd Khanate of Mongolia still nominally continued, with successive series of violent struggles, Soviet influence grew stronger. In 1924, after the Bogd Khan died of laryngeal cancer or, as some sources suggest, at the hands of Soviet spies, the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic was proclaimed on November 26, 1924. A nominally independent and sovereign country, it has been described as being a satellite state of the Soviet Union in the years from 1924 until 1990. This is supported by the fact that the Mongolian PR collapsed less than two months after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

During the Russian Civil War, Red Army troops occupied Tuva in January 1920, which had also been part of the Qing Empire of China and a protectorate of Imperial Russia. The Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic was proclaimed a nominally independent state in 1921, although it was tightly controlled by Moscow and is considered a satellite state of the Soviet Union until 1944, when the USSR annexed it into the Russian SFSR.

Another early Soviet satellite state in Asia was the short-lived Far Eastern Republic in Siberia.

===Post-World War II===
At the end of World War II, most Eastern and Central European countries were occupied by the Soviet Union, and along with the Soviet Union made up what is called the Soviet empire. Soviet forces remained in these countries after the war&#x27;s end. Through a series of coalition governments including communist parties, and then a forced liquidation of coalition members opposed by the Soviets, Stalinist systems were established in each country. Stalinists gained control of existing governments, police, press and radio outlets in these countries. Soviet satellite states of the Cold War included:
* People&#x27;s Republic of Albania (1946–1961)
* Polish People&#x27;s Republic (1947–1989)
* People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria (1946–1990)
* Romanian People&#x27;s Republic (1947–1965)
* Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (1948–1989)
* German Democratic Republic (1949–1990)
* Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic (1949–1989)
* Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia (1945–1948)
* Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic (1925–1991)
* Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (1948–1956)
* Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1978–1991)
Albania, Romania, and Yugoslavia ceased to be satellites before the revolutions of 1989. The Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia is considered an early Soviet satellite, as it broke from Soviet orbit in the 1948 Tito–Stalin split, with the Cominform offices being moved from Belgrade to Bucharest, and Yugoslavia subsequently formed the Non-Aligned Movement. The People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania, under the leadership of Enver Hoxha, broke ties with the Soviet Union in the Albanian–Soviet split following the Soviet de-Stalinisation process, and removed itself from Soviet influence in 1961. Romania&#x27;s de-satellization process started in 1956 and ended by 1965, with serious economic disagreements with Moscow resulting in a final rejection of Soviet hegemony in 1964.

From 1945 to 1948 North Korea was under Soviet Civil Administration, following this provisional governments were established under the Provisional People&#x27;s Committee of North Korea and People&#x27;s Committee of North Korea resulting in the establishment of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea in 1948. Some scholars consider North Korea a satellite state under the Soviet Union from 1948 until the 1958 August faction incident.

The short-lived East Turkestan Republic (1944–1949) was a Soviet satellite until it was absorbed into the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Between 1945 and the Iran crisis of 1946 the Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government and Republic of Mahabad existed as satellite states in Soviet-occupied Iran. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan was a satellite regime of the Soviet Union from 1978 to 1991. Between 1979 and 1989, Afghanistan was also under Soviet military occupation.

==Post-Cold War usage of the term==
Some commentators have expressed concern that United States military and diplomatic interventions in the Balkans, in the Middle East, and elsewhere might lead, or perhaps have already led, to the existence of American satellite states. William Pfaff warned that a permanent American presence in Iraq would &quot;turn Iraq into an American satellite state&quot;. In the Asia-Pacific, John Pilger accused ex Australian Prime Minister John Howard of turning the country into America&#x27;s 51st state and South Korea has regularly been described by North Korea for being a &quot;puppet state&quot; of the United States.

The term has also been used in the past to describe the relationship between Lebanon and Syria, as Syria has been accused of intervening in Lebanese political affairs. 

In addition, Eswatini and Lesotho have both been described as satellite states of South Africa.

<text>The Tribute in Light is an art installation created in remembrance of the September 11 attacks. It consists of 88 vertical searchlights arranged in two columns of light to represent the Twin Towers. It stands six blocks south of the World Trade Center on top of the Battery Parking Garage in New York City. &quot;Tribute in Light&quot; began as a temporary commemoration of the attacks in early 2002, but it became an annual event, currently produced on September 11 by the Municipal Art Society of New York. The &quot;Tribute in Light&quot; was conceived by artists John Bennett, Gustavo Bonevardi, Richard Nash Gould, Julian LaVerdiere, and Paul Myoda, and lighting consultant Paul Marantz.

The Tribute&#x27;s illumination begins at dusk and ends at dawn, with the lights being turned off for 20-minute periods to allow migratory birds to escape as needed. On clear nights, the lights can be seen from away, visible in all of New York City and most of suburban Northern New Jersey and Long Island. The lights can also be seen in Fairfield County, Connecticut, as well as Westchester, Orange, and Rockland counties in New York.

The 88 xenon spotlights (44 for each tower) each consume 7,000 watts. , the annual cost for the entire project was about $500,000.

A similar &quot;Tribute in Light&quot; has also appeared on occasion at the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia and at the crash site of United 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, which were also targeted during the 9/11 attacks.

==Background==

After the September 11 attacks, several people independently conceived the idea of using lights for remembrance. These efforts were merged under the umbrella of the Municipal Art Society and Creative Time.

&quot;Tribute in Light&quot; began construction on March 11, 2002, and initially ran as a temporary installation from March 11 to April 14, 2002, and it ran again on September 11, 2003, to mark the second anniversary of the attack. Since then, it has been repeated every year on September 11. It was announced that 2008 would be its final year, but the tribute was continued in 2009.

On December 17, 2009, it was confirmed that the tribute would continue through the tenth anniversary of the attacks in 2011. In 2012, plans were underway for the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum to assume the lease for the MTA property used during this tribute, and to begin transitioning operation of the tribute from the Municipal Art Society to the memorial foundation.

The lights are produced by an Italian company named Space Cannon, which sends a team every year to help with the installation. A Las Vegas-based company, Light America, was also part of the team who implemented the project.

Each year, about 30 technicians, electricians, and stagehands work for about ten days to install the lights. During a testing phase of several days, observers in Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey, and uptown Manhattan help make sure that the beams are adjusted accurately.

The project was originally going to be named &quot;Towers of Light&quot;, but the victims&#x27; families felt that the name emphasized the buildings destroyed instead of the people killed.

A permanent fixture of the &quot;Tribute in Light&quot; was at one point intended to be installed on the roof of One World Trade Center, but it was not included in the finished design.

Since 2008, the generators that power &quot;Tribute in Light&quot; have been fueled with biodiesel made from used cooking oil collected from local restaurants.

==Effects on birds==
The light pollution from &quot;Tribute in Light&quot; has caused confusion for over a million migrating birds, trapping them in the beams. Even at an altitude of several miles, birds can be affected by the lights. As a result of this effect, the beams are switched off for 20-minute periods to allow the birds to escape. To ensure the lights do not affect migrating birds, the Municipal Art Society works with the NYC Bird Alliance on the illumination. A 2017 study found that the installation &quot;dramatically altered multiple behaviors of nocturnally migrating birds—but these effects disappeared when lights were extinguished&quot;.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Tribute in Light&quot; was featured in Boyz II Men&#x27;s music video for &quot;Color of Love&quot;. It made a notable appearance during the opening credits of Spike Lee&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;25th Hour&quot;. The tribute was also shown and referenced in the CBS series &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;. These lights were featured in the music video of U2&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re the Best Thing About Me&quot;.

The video game adaptation of the film &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; features the lights at the approximate location of the WTC site, while another video game adaptation of the film &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;, the lights are seen on the construction site of One World Trade Center at night.

<doc id="44104" wikidata="Q700720" url="?curid=44104" title="Sigismund von Herberstein">
<text>Siegmund (Sigismund) Freiherr von Herberstein (or Baron Sigismund von Herberstein; 23 August 1486 – 28 March 1566) was a Carniolan diplomat, writer, historian and member of the Holy Roman Empire Imperial Council. He was most noted for his extensive writing on the geography, history and customs of Russia, and contributed greatly to early Western European knowledge of that area.

==Early life==
Herberstein was born in 1486 in Vipava () in the Duchy of Carniola, now in Slovenia, then part of the Habsburg monarchy. His parents were Leonhard von Herberstein and Barbara von Lueg, members of the prominent German-speaking family which had already resided in Herberstein Castle for nearly 200 years. Little is known of his early life apart from the fact that he became familiar with the Slovene language spoken in the region. This knowledge became significant later in his life.

In 1499, he entered the University of Vienna to study philosophy and law. In 1506, he entered the army as an officer and served in a number of campaigns. In 1508, he was knighted by the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I, in person. In 1515, he entered the Imperial council, or Parliament, and began a long and illustrious diplomatic career.

==Diplomatic career==
Between 1515 and 1553, Herberstein carried out approximately 69 missions abroad, travelling throughout much of Europe, including Turkey. He was feted by the ruling Habsburgs and rewarded with titles and estates. He was twice sent to Russia as ambassador of the Holy Roman Emperor, in 1517 to attempt to arrange a truce between Russia and Lithuania, and in 1526 to renew a treaty between the two signed in 1522. These extended visits (nine months in his 1517 visit) provided him with the opportunity to study a hitherto largely unknown Russian society.

==Writing on Russia==

Herberstein&#x27;s knowledge of Slovene, acquired in his youth, allowed him to communicate with Russians, as Slovene and Russian both belong to the Slavic languages. He used this ability to question a variety of people in Russia on a wide range of topics. This gave him an insight into Russia and Russians unavailable to the few previous visitors to Russia. 

He probably wrote his first account of life in Russia between 1517 and 1527, but no copy of this survives. In 1526, he was asked to produce a formal report on his experiences in Russia, but this remained relatively unnoticed in the archives until he was able to find time to revise and expand it, which he possibly started in the 1530s.

The evidence suggests that Herberstein was an energetic and capable ethnographer. He investigated in depth both by questioning locals and by critically examining the scarce existing literature on Russia. The result was his major work, a book written in Latin titled &quot;Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii&quot; (&quot;Notes on Muscovite Affairs&quot;), published in 1549. This became the main early source of knowledge in Western Europe on Russia.

He was the first to record the spelling of &quot;tsar&quot; as &quot;czar&quot; (both spellings are meant to express the same pronunciation). Later, English and French began to move from the &#x27;cz&#x27; spelling to the &#x27;ts&#x27; spelling in the 19th century.

Herberstein also referred to a &quot;Russian road guide&quot; that came into his possession for geographical data on the northern Urals and Siberia, which indicated that the territories were well known to the Russians at the time.

<doc id="44106" wikidata="Q700838" url="?curid=44106" title="Marwan al-Shehhi">
<text>Marwan Yousef Mohamed Rashid Lekrab al-Shehhi (; 9 May 197811 September 2001) was an Emirati terrorist hijacker from al-Qaeda who served as the hijacker-pilot of United Airlines Flight 175, crashing the Boeing 767 into the South Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the September 11 attacks. He was one of five hijackers aboard the aircraft and one of two Emiratis to take part in the attacks, the other being Fayez Banihammad, who helped him hijack the same plane.

Al-Shehhi was a student from the United Arab Emirates who moved to Germany in 1996 and soon became close friends with Mohamed Atta, Ziad Jarrah and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, forming the Hamburg cell. Together, after pledging their lives to martyrdom, they became the leaders of the 11 September attacks. In late 1999, al-Shehhi, Atta, Jarrah, and bin al-Shibh traveled to terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and met with Osama bin Laden who recruited the four Hamburg cell members for the attacks in the United States. He arrived in the United States in May 2000, one month before Atta. Atta, Al-Shehhi, and Jarrah had been trained as pilots in Florida at Huffman Aviation, receiving their commercial pilot licenses in December 2000 and January 2001 from the FAA.

Al-Shehhi spent his time making preparations for the attack itself, such as meeting with crucial planners abroad, assisting with the arrival of hijackers aboard the other flights, and travelling on surveillance flights determining details on how the hijacking would take place. On 9 September 2001, he traveled from Florida to Boston, where he stayed at the Milner Hotel until 11 September. After boarding United Airlines Flight 175 at Logan International Airport, al-Shehhi and 4 other hijackers waited 30 minutes into the flight to make their attack, which then allowed al-Shehhi to take over control as pilot, and at 9:03 a.m., 17 minutes after Mohamed Atta crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower, Al-Shehhi crashed the Boeing 767 into the South Tower of the World Trade Center between floors 77 to 85. At 23 years of age, he was the youngest hijacker-pilot to participate in the attacks. The impact of the Boeing 767 into the South Tower was seen live on television around the world as it happened. At 9:59 a.m., after 56 minutes of burning, the 110-story skyscraper collapsed, killing hundreds of people, including around 900 office workers and first responders.

==Early life==
Al-Shehhi was born in Ras al-Khaimah, on 9 May 1978, in the United Arab Emirates, to an Emirati Muslim cleric who died in 1997 and an Egyptian mother. Described as a quiet and devout Muslim, details about al-Shehhi&#x27;s life in the UAE, however, are difficult to acquire. He was a part of the Shihuh tribe through his father&#x27;s side. According to an October 2001 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;If residents of Mr. Shehhi&#x27;s hometown had heard of him before now, they were certainly not telling strangers. Four hours spent in the community yielded no address and no one – policemen, firemen, pedestrians or local officials – who did anything more than shrug at the mention of his name.&quot;

His teacher in Germany, Gabriele Bock, recalls him as someone who seemed to be struggling to have plans for the future while studying there.

While in Germany, al-Shehhi enrolled in the University of Bonn after completing a German course. He left Germany in June 1997 to attend to problems at home although the university forbade him. In early 1998, al-Shehhi transferred to the Technical University of Hamburg. A poor student, al-Shehhi was directed by the Scholarship program administrators to repeat a semester of his studies back in Bonn beginning in August 1998. Al-Shehhi did not enroll back at Bonn until January 1999 and continued to struggle with his studies. By July 1999, Marwan returned to Hamburg to study shipbuilding.

It has been reported al-Shehhi also married in 1999, holding a belated celebration in January 2000, in an arranged marriage by his half-brother with a young woman named Fawzeya.

==Radicalization==
After moving to Hamburg in 1998, al-Shehhi helped form the Hamburg cell with Mohamed Atta and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. There, his views became more and more radical. They met three or four times a week to discuss anti-American feelings and plot possible attacks. When someone asked why he and Atta never laughed, al-Shehhi retorted, &quot;How can you laugh when people are dying in Palestine?&quot;

On 9 October 1999, Marwan al-Shehhi was filmed at Said Bahaji&#x27;s wedding in Germany with other 9/11 hijackers including Ziad Jarrah.

In late 1999, al-Shehhi, Atta, Ziad Jarrah, Said Bahaji, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh decided to travel to Chechnya to fight against the Russians, but were convinced by Khalid al-Masri and Mohamedou Ould Slahi at the last minute to change their plans. They instead traveled to Afghanistan to meet with Osama bin Laden and trained for terrorist attacks. Immediately afterwards, Atta, al-Shehhi, and Jarrah reported their passports stolen, possibly to erase travel visas to Afghanistan. After their training, the hijackers began to attempt to hide their radicalism. al-Shehhi shaved his beard and seemed to his old friends like he had become less religious. After the attacks, a librarian in Hamburg reported that al-Shehhi boasted to her &quot;There will be thousands of dead. You will think of me ... You will see, in America something is going to happen. There will be many people killed.&quot;

==In the United States==
===Flight education and preparation===

Al-Shehhi was the first of the Hamburg group to leave for the United States. He arrived in Newark, New Jersey on 29 May 2000. Atta and Jarrah joined him the next month, and the three men began to search for flight schools. Al-Shehhi and Jarrah posed as body guards of Atta, who was posing as a &quot;Saudi Arabian royal family member&quot; while the three of them took flying lessons in Venice, Florida. They logged hundreds of hours on a Boeing 727 flight simulator. They received their licenses by December 2000. Their expenses were paid for by Ali Abdul Aziz Ali. On either 26 or 27 December, Atta, Jarrah, and al-Shehhi abandoned a Piper Cherokee that had stalled on the runway of Miami International Airport. On 31 December, the trio went to the Opa-Locka Airport and practiced on a Boeing 727 simulator. Al-Shehhi began to take &quot;surveillance flights&quot; in the summer of 2001, watching the operations of flight crews and making final preparations.

===August 2001===
On 23 August, the Israeli Mossad reportedly gave al-Shehhi&#x27;s name to the CIA as one of 19 belonging to US residents suspected of planning an attack on the United States in the near future. Only four of the names are known for certain, the other three belonging to fellow 9/11 hijackers Nawaf al-Hazmi, Mohamed Atta, and Khalid al-Mihdhar. It is not known if the list had all 19 hijackers&#x27; names or if it only had as many names as there were hijackers by coincidence.
On 26 August, al-Shehhi signed into the Panther Motel in Deerfield Beach, Florida, paying US$500, saying he wanted to stay until 2 September, and listing a Mailboxes Etc. as his permanent address. His register entry indicated that he was driving a blue Chevrolet Malibu, assumed to be the one rented by Atta two weeks prior, and manager Richard Surma said that he bent rules to allow al-Shehhi to have another man as an overnight guest. On 28 August, al-Shehhi went to the Miami International Airport, accompanied by an unknown man, where he purchased his ticket for Flight 175.

==September 11 attacks and death==
At 5:01 a.m. on the morning of 11 September Al-Shehhi in Boston received a phone call from Flight 93 hijacker pilot Ziad Jarrah in Newark. The call would be the last time Jarrah and Al-Shehhi spoke and is believed by authorities to be the two confirming to one another that the attacks were ready to begin.

After arriving at Logan International Airport later that morning, al-Shehhi made a call to Mohamed Atta lasting from 6:52 to 6:55, who was elsewhere in the same airport as both American 11 and United 175 were to fly from Logan to Los Angeles International Airport. The call is believed to have served the same purpose as Al-Shehhi&#x27;s earlier call to Jarrah.

Between 7:23 and 7:28, the five hijackers each boarded the plane, with Al-Shehhi taking his seat in 6C. The plane became airborne at 8:14, only to be hijacked 28 minutes after takeoff. The terrorists gained access to the cockpit through unknown means and murdered both pilots, allowing Al-Shehhi to assume control of the flight. Shortly after the hijacking, the plane came close to colliding with another aircraft in the vicinity, Delta Airlines Flight 2315. Approaching New York City, Al-Shehhi saw smoke and fire pouring southeast from the World Trade Center&#x27;s North Tower after it was struck by Flight 11 at 8:46 a.m., and narrowly avoided a second mid-air collision with Midwest Express Flight 7.

Flying at speeds of around while carrying approximately 9,100 gallons (approximately 34,447 liters) of jet fuel, Al-Shehhi crashed the plane into the South Tower at 9:03:02 a.m. between floors 77 and 85, instantly killing himself and everyone else aboard the flight in addition to many more inside the South Tower. More than 600 people were above the impact zone when the plane struck, half of whom were killed instantaneously. Thus, the estimated 300 people still alive following the impact were left stranded in the upper floors of the catastrophically damaged skyscraper, now set ablaze and rapidly filling with smoke. Because all eyes were on the Twin Towers following the crash of Flight 11 seventeen minutes earlier, the impact of Flight 175 and the explosion that followed was seen by millions of people worldwide on live television, being filmed and photographed from numerous vantage points. Although the angle at which Al-Shehhi crashed did not sever all means of escape from the impact zone, most of the people who survived the crash were unable to use the single intact stairwell before the tower fell less than an hour later.

Al-Shehhi flew the plane faster and lower into the tower than Atta did, into the eastern half of the South Tower&#x27;s southern facade close to the southeast corner, causing the tower&#x27;s structural integrity to be compromised far more severely than the North Tower&#x27;s. At 9:59 A.M. that morning, the South Tower became the first tower to collapse, having stood for 56 minutes after the plane crash.

<doc id="44108" wikidata="Q205734" url="?curid=44108" title="Minuet">
<text>A minuet (; also spelled menuet) is a social dance of French origin for two people, usually written in time but always played as if in (compound duple metre) to reflect the step pattern of the dance. The English word was adapted from the Italian &quot;minuetto&quot; and the French &quot;menuet&quot;. 

The term also describes the musical form that accompanies the dance, which subsequently developed more fully, often with a longer musical form called the minuet and trio, and was much used as a movement in the early classical symphony. While often stylized in instrumental forms, composers of the period would have been familiar with the popular dance. 

== Dance ==

The name may refer to the short steps, &quot;pas menus&quot;, taken in the dance, or else be derived from the &quot;branle à mener&quot; or &quot;amener&quot;, popular group dances in early 17th-century France. The minuet was traditionally said to have descended from the &quot;bransle de Poitou&quot;, though there is no evidence making a clear connection between these two dances. The earliest treatise to mention the possible connection of the name to the expression &quot;pas menus&quot; is Gottfried Taubert&#x27;s &quot;Rechtschaffener Tantzmeister&quot;, published in Leipzig in 1717, but this source does not describe the steps as being particularly small or dainty. At the period when it was most fashionable it was controlled, ceremonious and graceful.

== Music ==

=== Rhythm and form ===
The name of this dance is also given to a musical composition written in the same time and rhythm, though when not accompanying an actual dance the pace was quicker. Stylistically refined minuets, apart from the social dance context, were introduced—to opera at first—by Jean-Baptiste Lully, who included no fewer than 92 of them in his theatrical works and in the late 17th century the minuet was adopted into the suite, such as some of the suites of Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel. Among Italian and some French composers the minuet was often considerably quicker and livelier and was sometimes written in or time Because the tempo of a minuet was not standard, the tempo direction &quot;tempo di minuetto&quot; was ambiguous unless qualified by another direction, as it sometimes was.

Initially, before its adoption in contexts other than social dance, the minuet was usually in binary form, with two repeated sections of usually eight bars each. But the second section eventually expanded, resulting in a kind of ternary form. The second (or middle) minuet provided a form of contrast by means of different key (although in many works, the second minuet stayed in the same key as the first minuet), orchestration, and thematic material. On a larger scale, two such minuets might be further combined, so that the first minuet was followed by a second one and then by a repetition of the first. The whole form might in any case be repeated as long as the dance lasted.

==== Minuet and trio ====
Around the time of Jean-Baptiste Lully, it became a common practice to score this middle section for a trio (such as two oboes and a bassoon, as is common in Lully). As a result, this middle section came to be called the minuet&#x27;s &quot;trio&quot;, even when no trace of such an orchestration remains. The overall structure is called rounded binary or minuet form:
After these developments by Lully, composers occasionally inserted a modified repetition of the first (A) section or a section that contrasted with both the A section and what was thereby rendered the third or C section, yielding the form A–A′–B–A or A–B–C–A, respectively; an example of the latter is the third movement of Mozart&#x27;s Serenade No. 13 in G major, K. 525, popularly known under the title &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot;.

A livelier form of the minuet simultaneously developed into the scherzo (which was generally also coupled with a trio). This term came into existence approximately from Beethoven onwards, but the form itself can be traced back to Haydn.

The minuet and trio eventually became the standard third movement in the four-movement classical symphony, Johann Stamitz being the first to employ it thus with regularity.

An example of the true form of the minuet is to be found in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

A famous example of a more recent instrumental work in minuet form is Ignacy Jan Paderewski&#x27;s Minuet in G.
