<text>The Hotel Chelsea (also known as the Chelsea Hotel and the Chelsea) is a hotel at 222 West 23rd Street in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Built between 1883 and 1884, the hotel was designed by Philip Hubert in a style described variously as Queen Anne Revival and Victorian Gothic. The 12-story Chelsea, originally a housing cooperative, has been the home of numerous writers, musicians, artists, and entertainers, some of whom still lived there in the 21st century. , most of the Chelsea is a luxury hotel. The building is a New York City designated landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places.

The front facade of the Hotel Chelsea is 11 stories high, while the rear of the hotel rises 12 stories. The facade is divided vertically into five sections and is made of brick, with some flower-ornamented iron balconies; the hotel is capped by a high mansard roof. The Hotel Chelsea has thick load-bearing walls made of masonry, as well as wrought iron floor beams and large, column-free spaces. When the hotel opened, the ground floor was divided into an entrance hall, four storefronts, and a restaurant; this has been rearranged over the years, with a bar and the El Quijote restaurant occupying part of the ground floor. The Chelsea was among the first buildings in the city with duplex and penthouse apartments, and there is also a rooftop terrace. The hotel originally had no more than 100 apartments; it was subdivided into 400 units during the 20th century and has 155 units as of 2022.

The idea for the Chelsea arose after Hubert &amp; Pirsson had developed several housing cooperatives in New York City. Developed by the Chelsea Association, the structure quickly attracted authors and artists after opening. Several factors, including financial hardships and tenant relocations, prompted the Chelsea&#x27;s conversion into an apartment hotel in 1905. Knott Hotels took over the hotel in 1921 and managed it until about 1942, when David Bard bought it out of bankruptcy. Julius Krauss and Joseph Gross joined Bard as owners in 1947. After David Bard died in 1964, his son Stanley operated it for 43 years, forming close relationships with many tenants. The hotel underwent numerous minor changes in the late 20th century after falling into a state of disrepair. The Krauss and Gross families took over the hotel in 2007 and were involved in numerous tenant disputes before the Chelsea closed for a major renovation in 2011. The hotel changed ownership twice in the 2010s before BD Hotels took over in 2016, and the Chelsea reopened in 2022.

Over the years, the Chelsea has housed many notables, among them Mark Twain, Dylan Thomas, Arthur Miller, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Leonard Cohen, Arthur C. Clarke, Patti Smith, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Virgil Thomson. The Chelsea received much commentary for the creative culture that Bard helped create within the hotel. Critics also appraised the hotel&#x27;s interior—which was reputed for its uncleanliness in the mid- and late 20th century—and the quality of the hotel rooms themselves. The Chelsea has been the setting or inspiration for many works of popular media, and it has been used as an event venue and filming location.

== Site ==
The Hotel Chelsea is at 222 West 23rd Street in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City, on the south side of the street between Eighth Avenue and Seventh Avenue. The rectangular land lot covers approximately , with a frontage of on Madison Avenue to the west and a depth of . Seven land lots were combined to make way for the hotel, which was 175 feet wide and deep. Before what became the Hotel Chelsea was developed, a furniture store had stood on the site; it burned down in 1878, and the site remained vacant for four years afterward. The furniture store and the land had belonged to James Ingersoll, who was affiliated with the Tammany Hall political ring in the 1870s. When the Chelsea was finished in 1884, there was a church on either side of the lot.

== Architecture ==
The Hotel Chelsea was designed by Philip Hubert of the firm of Hubert, Pirrson &amp; Company. The style has been described variously as Queen Anne Revival, Victorian Gothic, or a mixture of the two. It was one of the first Victorian Gothic buildings to be erected in New York City. At the time of its completion, it was the city&#x27;s tallest apartment building and one of the tallest structures in Manhattan, at approximately tall. According to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, the Chelsea&#x27;s design was evocative of the demolished Spanish Flats on Central Park South.

=== Facade ===

The front facade of the hotel, on 23rd Street, is 11 stories high and is divided vertically into 25 bays. The rear of the hotel rises to a height of 12 stories. The 23rd Street facade is made of red brick. It is grouped into five sections, with projecting pavilions at the western end, center, and eastern end of the facade. These pavilions flank two groups of recessed bays. The main entrance within the central pavilion remains largely intact, although the storefronts on either side have been modified over the years. There are several brass plaques next to the main entrance, commemorating notable residents, and another plaque mentioning that the building is on the National Register of Historic Places.

On the upper floors, the brick is interspersed with white stone bands. The hotel has flower-ornamented iron balconies on its second through eighth stories, which were constructed by J.B. and J.M. Cornell. These balconies were intended as &quot;light balconies, after the Paris fashion&quot;; according to author Sherill Tippins, the balconies were meant to &quot;add charm to the lower floors&quot;. The balconies were also intended to indicate that the interiors were ornately decorated. French doors lead from some apartments to the balconies.

The building is topped by a high mansard roof. The central pavilion has a pyramidal slate roof. There are brick chimneys on either side of the pyramidal-roofed pavilion. In addition, the pavilions on either end of the facade are topped by brick gables with large arched windows. The remainder of the roof features dormer windows and additional brick chimneys. Atop the roof was a brick-floored space, which could be adapted into a roof garden or promenade. The center of the roof was interspersed with hip roofs, beneath which were duplex apartments; residents of these duplexes had direct access to the roof.

=== Structural and mechanical features ===
The Hotel Chelsea has thick load-bearing walls made of masonry, which measure thick at their bottoms and taper to at their tops. This allowed the superstructure to support the weight of two additional stories if the building were expanded. The walls support floor beams made of wrought iron; these floor beams are not supported by intermediate columns, creating large column-free spaces. The floor beams were covered with plaster to prevent fire from spreading. As another fireproofing measure, the hotel used as little wood as possible. Ceilings measured high.

The basement measured up to deep and housed the kitchen, laundry, refrigerators, coal rooms, engines, and machinery for gas-powered and electric light. As planned, the hotel had three passenger elevators and two steam-powered freight lifts. When it was completed in 1884, the hotel had speaking tubes; pressurized steam; a telephone in each room, connecting to the hotel manager&#x27;s office; and 1,800 lights powered by either gas or electricity. The hotel contained then-innovative features such as electricity, steam heating, and hot and cold water. Dumbwaiters transported food from the basement kitchen to each floor.

=== Public areas ===
When the hotel opened in 1884, the ground floor was divided into an entrance hall, four storefronts, and a restaurant for tenants who did not have their own kitchen. The lobby was originally furnished with a marble floor and mahogany wainscoting. On the left wall of the lobby was an elaborate fireplace mantel, which remained intact in the late 20th century. To the right of the lobby was a reception room decorated in white maple, a plush-and-velvet carpet, and old-gold surfaces. Three interconnected dining rooms, reserved for residents, were placed behind the lobby. These rooms had decorations such as stained glass, carved gargoyles, and fleurs-de-lis. Next to the lobby was a manager&#x27;s office, whose ceiling had gold trimmings and a mural with clouds and angels. There was also a barbershop, as well as a restaurant, cafe, laundry room, billiards room, bakery, fish-and-meat shop, and grocery on the ground floor and basement. Hotel staff lived in another building behind the main hotel, connected to it by a tunnel.

As of 2022, the hotel&#x27;s lobby is decorated with inlaid ceilings and mosaic-tile floors. The lobby contains furniture in various colors, while the front desk is clad with purple marble. In addition, various paintings by residents are hung on the beige-pink walls, and the lobby&#x27;s ceiling is decorated with frescoes, roses, and garlands. Adjacent to the lobby is the Lobby Bar, which contains mosaic-tile floors, a marble bar, art from former residents, and old chandeliers. This bar, formerly storage space, has several pieces of mid-century modern furniture and vintage furnishings such as lamps. Other decorative elements include skylights, floor tiles, brick walls, and trellises covered with vegetation.

Next to the lobby is the El Quijote restaurant, which has occupied the hotel since 1955. The restaurant is decorated with a marble terrazzo floor, a rough-hewn ceiling, red-vinyl dining booths, and chandeliers. Among the decorations are a series of murals depicting scenes from the book &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, as well as oil paintings. El Quijote contains a private bar next to its main dining room. Prior to 2018, the restaurant sat 220 people; the Dulcinea and Cervantes rooms at the rear comprised nearly half of the restaurant&#x27;s seating capacity. These rooms were removed in a 2022 renovation, which also reduced the restaurant&#x27;s capacity to 45 or 65. Since 2023, the hotel has also contained the Café Chelsea bistro, located within three rooms. The bistro includes vintage decorations, some taken from the Lord &amp; Taylor Building.

Also at ground level is a mom-and-pop store named Chelsea Guitars and a private event space known as the Bard Room. The main staircase, at the center of the hotel, is illuminated by a rooftop skylight and is only accessible to guests. The walls of the staircase were once lined with photos created by residents. The staircase originally had iron railings and marble treads. The center of the building is surmounted by a pyramid accessed by a narrow wooden staircase. There was also an elevator cage, decorated with rosettes that matched the exterior decorations. The upper stories include a gym and a rooftop spa.

=== Guestrooms and apartments ===

==== Original units ====
The Chelsea was among the first buildings in the city with duplex apartments and penthouse apartments. Above the ground floor, there were originally either 90, 97, or 100 apartments in total. There were ten apartments on each story, ranging from . Each floor had a mixture of small and large apartments, so residents of different socioeconomic classes could reside on the same story. Sources disagree on whether the largest apartments had eight, ten, or twelve rooms. Old floor plans show that the apartments were arranged along a single west–east corridor on each floor; these corridors measured up to wide. The largest apartments occupied either end of the hotel and had at least four bedrooms, while mid-sized two- and three-bedroom units were placed next to these. The smallest units, targeted at unmarried men and women, were arranged near the stairs and elevators at the center of the building.

A variety of styles and materials were used in the apartments to fit each tenant&#x27;s taste. Originally, the interiors were ornately decorated. The dadoes and some of the floors were made of marble, and there was also hardwood floors and doors. In addition, the fireplace mantels were made of onyx, and the fireplaces contained andirons with rosettes.

Every apartment had its own bathroom, and many units also had servants&#x27; bedrooms. Only the largest apartments had kitchens; everyone else received meals from the restaurants or a caterer. There were 67 apartments with kitchens, each of which had a refrigerator as well as a stove powered by coal, gas, or steam. One of the larger apartments, suite 920, belonged to the hotel&#x27;s manager and consisted of three rooms with high ceilings. The apartments on the tenth and eleventh floors were intended for artists, taking advantage of sunlight from the north. These apartments were arranged as duplexes, with artists&#x27; studios on the upper level and bedrooms on the lower level, and were in high demand when the Chelsea opened. The twelfth floor contained a space accessible only from the rooftop promenade; this was intended as a clinic. Tenants could also use a ballroom under the roof.

==== Subsequent changes ====

By the 1980s, the hotel had been subdivided into 400 rooms, many of which retained their original thick walls and fireplaces. This was reduced by the 2000s to about 240 or 250 units (some with multiple rooms). All of the units had a unique layout. The rooms were accessed via wide marble corridors and varied significantly in decorative motif.

Following a renovation that was completed in 2022, some decorative features, such as entry halls and doorknobs, were redesigned with monograms containing the hotel&#x27;s name. There are approximately 155 rooms, divided into 125 single-room units and 30 suites; the largest units are two-bedroom apartments with en-suite kitchens. As an allusion to the Chelsea&#x27;s artistic clientele, the rooms are decorated with artworks collected between the 1970s and the 1990s, in addition to headboards with splattered-paint patterns. Some rooms retain original fireplaces and stained glass windows. The guestrooms also have design features such as wooden nightstands, closets with wallpaper, and marble-clad bathrooms. Five of the former artists&#x27; residences are retained in the modern-day hotel, and some of the rooms have wheelchair-accessible features such as shelves and bathrooms.

== History ==
During the early 19th century, apartment developments in the city were generally associated with the working class, but by the late 19th century, apartments were also becoming desirable among the middle and upper classes. Between 1880 and 1885, more than ninety apartment buildings were developed in the city. The architect Philip Hubert and his partner James W. Pirrson had created a &quot;Hubert Home Club&quot; in 1880 for the Rembrandt, a six-story building on 57th Street that had been built as housing for artists. This early cooperative building had rental units to help defray costs, and it also provided servants as part of the building staff. The success of this model led to other &quot;Hubert Home Clubs&quot;, including the Chelsea. Hubert believed that such clubs could help entice middle- and upper-class New Yorkers to live in apartment buildings.

=== Development ===
After constructing several more Home Clubs in the 1880s, Hubert decided to construct a structure in Chelsea. In contrast to previous clubs, where residents were selected according to their beliefs and socioeconomic status, Hubert wanted the new building to house as diverse a group of residents as possible. Hubert planned a structure as a self-contained, purpose-built artists&#x27; community, based on a concept by the philosopher Charles Fourier. The structure, later known as the Chelsea Hotel, was originally known as the Chelsea Association Building and was to be developed by the Chelsea Association. It is unknown who specifically devised the idea for the building. A construction materials dealer named George M. Smith applied for the hotel&#x27;s building permit; he was one of several members of the Chelsea Association&#x27;s building committee. By contrast, a contemporary &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; article described &quot;some 50 people of means&quot; as having been responsible for development.

Hubert identified a vacant site on 23rd Street between Eighth and Seventh Avenues, which had been occupied by James Ingersoll&#x27;s furniture store, as well as an adjoining townhouse on 22nd Street. Hubert paid Ingersoll $175,000 () for the plots and promised Ingersoll an apartment in the new building, as well as membership in the Chelsea Association. Hubert, Pirsson &amp; Co. filed plans in early 1883 for a &quot;cooperative club apartment house&quot; on the site at an estimated cost of $350,000 (). In August 1883, the Chelsea Association obtained a $200,000 mortgage loan for the building () from the Equitable Life Assurance Society. The same bank placed a $300,000 mortgage loan on the hotel that December (). By March 1884, the Chelsea Association Building was nearly complete. One account in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the Chelsea as &quot;the most profitable and popular of [Hubert and Pirsson&#x27;s] enterprises&quot;.

=== Early years and hotel conversion ===
The Chelsea began accepting residents in 1884 and was structured as a housing cooperative. Two-thirds of the original apartments were owned by Chelsea Association stockholders, and the other third were rented out. Almost from the outset, the Chelsea was one of the most popular of Hubert&#x27;s Home Clubs, and there were more prospective tenants than available apartments. Tippins wrote that, &quot;from the beginning, the Chelsea was a home for eccentrics and the artists were there by design&quot;. The Chelsea was located in what was then the center of New York City&#x27;s theater district, with venues such as the Booth&#x27;s Theatre and the Grand Opera House nearby.

Its early residents represented a wide variety of groups, from unmarried professionals to large families. Many of the hotel&#x27;s early guests were authors and artists. According to the &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot;, many construction suppliers and workers moved into the apartments rather than accept monetary compensation. The building also attracted wealthy widows, government officials, and a variety of other middle- and upper-class professionals, though Hubert refused to disclose residents&#x27; names for the social registers. These residents largely moved from other apartment buildings. There were also 30 servants, mostly immigrants from Germany and Ireland.

In 1898, &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; described the Chelsea as one of Manhattan&#x27;s &quot;literary shrines&quot;, in part because of the presence of residents such as Edward Eggleston and Jane Cunningham Croly. Other early residents included painter Rufus Fairchild Zogbaum, poet Henry Abbey, and actress Annie Russell. By the end of the 19th century, the co-op was in decline due to the suspicions of New York City&#x27;s middle class about apartment living, the development of houses further north in Manhattan, and the relocation of the city&#x27;s theater district. The 1893 economic crash, and the lasting effects of another crash in the 1900s, further strained the Chelsea Association&#x27;s finances. During the 1890s, many of the Chelsea Association&#x27;s original stockholders either died, moved away, or had become involved in legal and financial controversies. By the 1900s, the Chelsea was accepting a larger number of short-term visitors. A &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporter wrote in the late 20th century that the co-op had never &quot;had a heyday&quot;, as many wealthy residents were already moving uptown after the hotel was completed.

The building was officially converted to an apartment hotel in 1905. At the time of the conversion, the Chelsea was divided into 125 units. Small studios that had been converted from maids&#x27; quarters were available for as little as $1.50 per night (), while units that had one or two bedrooms cost up to $4–5 per night (equivalent to between $ and $ in ). In the first two decades of the 20th century, the hotel hosted events such a merchandise sales; meetings of local groups, like the Chelsea Society of New York and Syracuse University Club of New York; and educational lectures. Following the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912, several guests from the &quot;Titanic&quot; were also given rooms at the hotel. The managers sometimes removed guests&#x27; corpses from the hotel. The opening of the New York City Subway&#x27;s Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line in the late 1910s had spurred development in the surrounding area, although the Hotel Chelsea remained in use as an apartment hotel. One of the ground-level stores was leased to the Greater Engineering Company in 1920.

=== Knott operation ===
Knott Hotels, a family-owned firm that operated numerous budget hotels in New York City, leased the hotel in March 1921, establishing the 222 West Twenty-third Street Hotel Corporation to operate the Chelsea. The lease initially ran until 1942. By then, half of the Chelsea Association&#x27;s original stockholders remained, and many parts of the hotel needed to be repaired or upgraded. Shortly after taking over, the Knotts split up some of the apartments, added a reception desk at the bottom of the Chelsea&#x27;s grand staircase, closed the dining room, and added kitchenettes to existing apartments. In addition, the hotel&#x27;s American floor numbering system was changed to a European floor numbering system; for instance, the second story, directly above ground level, was renumbered as floor 1. The Knott family extended their lease by another 43 years in 1922, agreeing to pay a total of $6,196,000 () through the lease&#x27;s projected expiration in 1985.

The Hotel Chelsea continued to serve as a &quot;headquarters for painters and writers&quot;, as described by the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. The Hotel Carteret was erected to the east in 1927, blocking eastward views from the Chelsea. To attract more tenants, the Knotts decreased prices for rooms at the eastern end of the hotel. In addition, the Knott family transferred the hotel&#x27;s ownership to the Knott Corporation, a Delaware company, in September 1927. By the end of the 1920s, the Chelsea had been further subdivided into more than 300 rooms. The Knotts had replaced the lobby&#x27;s paintings with wallpaper, and they had moved the original lobby furniture to make way for a heater on a banquette. Most of the hotel&#x27;s bellhops and waiters were African-American by this time. Switchboard operators and desk clerks called residents by their nicknames. The &quot;Asbury Park Press&quot; called the Chelsea one of the &quot;last ornate landmarks of a Little Old New York locality&quot;.

Batchelder&#x27;s Restaurant leased the Chelsea&#x27;s restaurant space in early 1930. During that decade, the Chelsea Hotel remained popular among artists and writers because of the low rents, the friendly atmosphere, and the fact that the residences provided large amounts of privacy. Because many of the old apartments had been subdivided, each floor had various winding corridors leading to the different rooms. The low rents in particular attracted artists like John Sloan and Edgar Lee Masters. There was controversy in late 1934 when then-manager Jerry Gagin commissioned a series of satirical paintings from John McKiernan, depicting three politicians. Knott Hotels president William Knott ordered Gagin to remove the murals, but Gagin refused, and the murals were instead covered up.

=== Bard, Gross, and Krauss operation ===
The last member of the Chelsea Association died around 1941, and the hotel went bankrupt around the same time. The New York Bank for Savings repossessed the building at an auction in approximately July 1942. That October, the Bank for Savings sold the hotel, along with the adjacent brownstone house at 229 West 22nd Street, to the Chelsea Hotel Company at an assessed value of $561,500 (). The buyers took over a $220,000 mortgage () that had been placed on the hotel. At the time, the hotel had seven stores, 319 guestrooms, and 176 bathrooms. Following the sale to the Chelsea Hotel Company, the hotel was operated by a syndicate of Hungarian immigrants represented by David Bard and Frank Amigo. The new operators were tasked with updating the hotel, which had outdated plumbing and electrical wiring; dilapidated elevators; and dirty walls. In addition, Bard had to dispel rumors circulating among existing tenants, who believed that Bard had won the hotel in a poker game and wanted to raze it.

The United States Shipping Board leased the ground and second floors in late 1942, and members of the United States Maritime Service used the space as the U.S. Maritime Service Graduate Station. In 1944, architect Morris Whinston filed plans for $5,000 () worth of alterations to the hotel. The Chelsea started to become associated with bohemianism during the 1940s and 1950s, and many original design details were removed during that era. A 1946 article in the &quot;Troy Record&quot; noted that artists lived in 25 of the Chelsea&#x27;s 300 units and that the hotel no longer served traditional celebrities. The structure also hosted office tenants such as the World Congress of the Partisans of Peace on the ground floor. Bard had grown exasperated of the tenants&#x27; complaints by 1947, when he sold most of his shares to desk clerk Julius Krauss and plumber Joseph Gross, retaining five percent of his shares in the building. During this era, the hotel often served as a gathering place for left-wing and socialist activists; for instance, one of the ground-floor spaces was occupied by left-wing organizers who supported the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine.

Bard again became involved in the hotel&#x27;s operations by the early 1950s. By then, additional apartments had been subdivided, and the interiors had been significantly modified. The floors had been covered with linoleum; the walls had been painted over; and the skylight above the Chelsea&#x27;s main staircase had been sealed. Bard, Gross, and Krauss jointly operated the hotel through the rest of this decade. The El Quijote restaurant, operated by a group of Spanish immigrants, moved to the Hotel Chelsea in 1955. The next year, inspectors found that the hotel had accumulated sixteen violations of city building codes. By the late 1950s, the Chelsea had begun to accept black residents, starting with the printmaker Robert Blackburn, and European artists were increasingly moving in. David Bard had sold all of his remaining hotels and spent large amounts of his time talking to the artists and authors who resided there. His son Stanley, who would later manage the hotel himself, recalled being jealous of the hotel because David spent all of his time there.

By the beginning of the 1960s, the Chelsea Hotel was known as the &quot;Dowager of 23rd Street&quot;, and the surrounding area was populated with what Tippins referred to as &quot;tawdry bars and low-rent offices&quot;. Nearly all of the entertainment venues in the area had been replaced with stores and apartments. Most of the hotel&#x27;s occupants were long-term residents, who rarely moved away due to the low rental rates. Nouveaux Realistes artists also began to frequent the hotel in the 1960s, and pop artists often collaborated there by 1962. The New York Community Trust installed a plaque outside the building in 1962, detailing the hotel&#x27;s history. Other plaques honoring specific residents were installed in the mid-1960s, including those for the author Thomas Wolfe and the playwright and poet Brendan Behan.

=== Stanley Bard operation ===
Stanley Bard became manager in 1964 after his father died. Stanley, who had been a plumber&#x27;s assistant at the hotel since 1957 or 1958, was already familiar with many of the hotel&#x27;s artistic residents when he assumed the managerial role. He began trying to attract artists who had been rejected from other hotels. Bard did not run advertisements, instead attracting new residents via word of mouth. The remaining co-owners, Joseph Gross and Julius Krauss, continued to work under Stanley Bard.

Stanley Bard was less strict than his predecessors, allowing residents to combine apartments on the basis of a handshake deal. Residents could install their own art, and pets might be allowed based on Stanley&#x27;s whims. Film director Ethan Hawke, a onetime resident, recalled that Stanley charged residents different rates based on whether he liked them; a headline in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; proclaimed that &quot;If Stanley Bard likes your wife you&#x27;ll get a room at the Chelsea&quot;. Bard generally had a lax attitude toward unpaid rent; he sometimes accepted paintings created by residents who were unable to pay rent, and he started displaying these works in the lobby. Another resident who could not afford rent was hired as a bellhop. Despite Bard&#x27;s cavalier attitude toward guests&#x27; activities, he closely monitored all aspects of the hotel and sometimes refused to rent rooms to people who were disruptive or those that he disliked.

Although Bard sometimes did not pay attention to maintenance (leading one resident to say that &quot;the place was held together with Scotch tape&quot;), he helped curate the artistic community there, providing artists with materials and looking after their children. The hotel also came to be known as a place where creative and eccentric figures stayed. Bard stated in 1975 that he had friendships with tenants, not &quot;tenant–landlord&quot; relationships, and residents were free to walk into his office and talk with him. Bard had a bookcase in his office, with books written by residents. Tippins writes that Bard&#x27;s inobtrusive management approach, along with the &quot;self-directing population ... and members&#x27; willingness to live in the moment&quot;, created a strong artistic culture at the hotel.

==== 1960s and 1970s ====

By the mid-1960s, the hotel began to attract artists who frequented Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory studio, as well as rock musicians (who were not allowed in many other hotels). The &quot;Austin American&quot; described the hotel as having &quot;400 rooms, 150 kitchens, and 150 fireplaces&quot;. The hotel was physically decaying during that time, though the facade was cleaned. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the Hotel Chelsea as a city landmark in March 1966, a decision ratified by the New York City Board of Estimate that June, despite opposition from a local planning board, which called the Chelsea a &quot;shabby institution&quot;. The hotel, which was recognized for both architectural and historical significance, thus became one of the city&#x27;s first official landmarks. Later the same year, Bard decided to redecorate the lobby after the release of Warhol&#x27;s film &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; drew attention to the hotel. The staircase was also cleaned in phases from top to bottom.

The popularity of &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot;—along with that of the album &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, written by Chelsea Hotel resident Bob Dylan—attracted many aspiring artists and actors to the hotel during the late 1960s, in spite of its rundown condition. About half of the rooms were occupied by permanent residents by the early 1970s; although new residents had to pay at least $400 () per month, older residents were protected by rent regulation and paid as little as $155 a month (). &quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote that the Chelsea was &quot;the only landmark building still doing business&quot; from the time when the neighborhood was a major theatrical hub. The hotel&#x27;s residents included many stage and film stars, artists, and &quot;less conventional celebrities&quot;, who stayed despite the lack of modern amenities and the presence of pests. The cheapest units tended to have more issues. For many residents, however, there was &quot;no life outside the Hotel&quot;, so they did not feel compelled to move. By the early 1970s, residents were increasingly unable to pay rent because of a general economic downturn, and Bard was forced to evict some residents to reduce expenses.

The hotel was in decline by the mid-1970s, with graffitied walls and a cockroach infestation. Residents removed some of the stained-glass windows and iron grates for scrap. It was common to see drug users in bathrooms and drug dealers in the hallways, and a brothel also operated openly within the hotel. Resident suicides and fires were frequent, as were robberies. Robbers held several residents hostage in a 1974 robbery, and the Chelsea was damaged in a 1978 fire that killed one resident. The death of Nancy Spungen at the hotel in 1978, and the death of her boyfriend—Sid Vicious, who had been charged with her murder—the next year, brought further negative attention to the hotel. Nonetheless, the Chelsea&#x27;s reputation as an artists&#x27; and authors&#x27; haven remained intact. Although there were frequent remarks about the &quot;downright creepy&quot; atmosphere, many residents remained in spite of the decline in both the hotel and the surrounding neighborhood. Bard dispelled concerns by saying that any major crime at the hotel was covered by the media due to the Chelsea&#x27;s bohemian nature. According to Laurie Johnston of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the hotel had &quot;some glittery (and, to some old-liners, scary) clientele among rock musicians and such&quot;. The hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

==== 1980s to 2000s ====
Bard and the Chelsea&#x27;s residents had planned a centennial celebration in November 1983, though the celebration was delayed by a year. Bard said at the time that he wanted &quot;to keep the atmosphere kooky but nice, eccentric but beautiful&quot;, rather than updating the hotel to keep up with the surrounding neighborhood&#x27;s gentrification. He accommodated residents&#x27; creativity and maintained close relationships with tenants, to the point that residents spoke with staff &quot;as they were family&quot; and walked behind Bard&#x27;s desk to get their own mail. The hotel also attracted many tourists who wanted to experience its &quot;eccentric&quot; nature, although the staff mainly catered to long-term residents. The Chelsea was still cheap; nightly room rates were about one-third that of more upscale hotels uptown, and studios there were less expensive than others in the neighborhood. By the mid-1980s, the hotel largely catered to the punk subculture, and it was 80 percent residential by the late 1980s. The hotel building itself remained in a state of disrepair: for instance, a balcony fell off the facade in 1986, injuring two passersby. The balcony&#x27;s collapse prompted a subsequent renovation of the building.

After Bard&#x27;s children David and Michele became involved in the hotel&#x27;s operation during the 1990s, they completed a $500,000 renovation of the facade in 1990 and renovated one of the sixth-floor rooms. David Bard upgraded the lobby&#x27;s equipment, and the family subdivided the ground-level ladies&#x27; reception room into a set of offices, but they left the ceiling murals intact. The reception desk had been relocated to a niche off the main lobby. The Chelsea&#x27;s reputation for &quot;wildness&quot; receded in the 1990s, though the hotel continued to attract artistic tenants under Bard&#x27;s management. Long-term residents paid up to $3,000 a month in rent, while short-term guestrooms cost up to $295. Short-term guests also traveled to the hotel for a variety of reasons. Some wished to stay in rooms occupied by particular residents, while others traveled there because of their cheap rates. The guestrooms lacked modern amenities such as minibars, room service, and cable TV.

In spite of Stanley Bard&#x27;s unorthodox approach to rent collection, the hotel&#x27;s finances remained stable in the 1990s. The Bards continued to renovate selected rooms as part of a wide-ranging rehabilitation, and they also renovated the lobby. By the end of the 20th century, three-fourths of the hotel was occupied by long-term residents, and monthly rents ranged from $2,000 to $5,000. Bard wished to maintain the hotel&#x27;s character, showing preference to artists over other potential tenants. There was also an art gallery and a basement bar named Serena.

Unfounded rumors of a potential sale were circulating by the end of the 20th century. Marlene Krauss, the daughter of Julius Krauss, told Bard to stop renewing long-term residents&#x27; leases in 2005. Meanwhile, longtime resident David Elder (the grandson of Joseph Gross and the son of playwright and screenwriter Lonne Elder III) filed a lawsuit in 2005 to have Bard removed as the hotel&#x27;s manager. At the time, three-fifths of the hotel&#x27;s 240–250 rooms were occupied by permanent residents. Temporary guestrooms and permanent residents&#x27; rooms were interspersed. As a result of rising expenses, there were fewer penurious artists living in the Chelsea compared to the mid- and late 20th century. A nightclub called the Star Lounge opened in the Chelsea&#x27;s basement in early 2007.

=== Conversion to luxury hotel ===

==== Krauss–Elder operation ====

In 2007, an arbitrator ruled that Bard&#x27;s family owned 58 percent of the hotel&#x27;s value but that his partners had a majority stake in the operation. In addition, Bard was ordered to pay back $1 million and gave Marlene Krauss and David Elder control over the hotel for ten years. The hotel&#x27;s board of directors ousted Bard in June 2007, after Krauss and Elder claimed that Bard had allowed tenants to stay even if they had fallen far behind on their rent. Krauss and Elder hired BD Hotels to manage the Chelsea. BD Hotels attempted to correct several violations of city building codes and obtain documentation on tenants who were not registered with the city government. The new operators also opened a basement lounge and restored the ballroom. Krauss wished to increase the number of short-term guests and renovate the retail space.

The hotel stopped leasing apartments in 2007; filmmaker Sam Bassett became the last long-term resident to sign a lease at the hotel. Many hotel residents feared that the plans would change the character of the hotel, one of the few remaining non-gentrified places in Chelsea, and they expressed concerns that the new manager was not accommodating toward them. At the time, Krauss and Elder were evicting tenants and were planning a renovation of the hotel. Elder denied that tenants were being targeted, saying that all of the evicted tenants had failed to pay rent; according to BD Hotels officials, some tenants owed more than $10,000. BD Hotels was fired in April 2008 and subsequently filed a wrongful dismissal lawsuit against the hotel&#x27;s operators. Andrew Tilley was hired to manage the hotel in June 2008 and continued to serve eviction notices to tenants. The hotel was involved in other controversies such as a disagreement over the demolition of an apartment once occupied by Bob Dylan. Tilley resigned after seven months, citing tenant harassment.

Elder took over direct management of the hotel in 2009. Under Elder&#x27;s management, the hotel phased out long-term leases in favor of 25-day leases. By 2010, ninety long-term residents remained; another forty had moved out during the previous three years. A nightclub known as the Chelsea Room opened in the basement that October, after the former Star Lounge&#x27;s space had been gutted. The Chelsea&#x27;s 15 shareholders put the hotel up for sale in October 2010, when there were 125 short-term guestrooms and 100 apartments. Real-estate experts estimated that a buyer would have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to renovate each room, overcoming tenant opposition and restrictions posed by the hotel&#x27;s city-landmark status. Stanley Bard&#x27;s son David made a bid to buy the Chelsea, as did developer Aby Rosen and hoteliers Ian Schrager and André Balazs. A Doughnut Plant shop opened at the hotel in early 2011.

==== Chetrit and Scheetz operation ====
Real estate developer Joseph Chetrit announced in May 2011 that he had bought the hotel for $80 million. Chetrit stopped taking reservations for new guests that July and officially took title to the hotel the next month. Gene Kaufman was hired to design a renovation of the Chelsea, which was funded by an $85 million loan from Natixis. Kaufman intended to change the room layouts and renovate vacant retail space in the basement and ground floor. Residents protected by state rent regulation laws were allowed to remain, but the staff were fired. Chetrit also moved to evict a tattoo parlor and some of the non-rent-regulated residents. That September, resident Zoe Pappas formed the Chelsea Tenants Association, which about half of the remaining residents joined. The Chelsea&#x27;s managers ordered that all artwork be placed into storage in November, prompting more tenant complaints; a rooftop garden tended by residents was also destroyed.

From 2011 to 2013, residents filed a large number of lawsuits against Chetrit. Tenants complained that the project was creating health hazards, although the city&#x27;s Building Department found no major violations of building codes. Following a lawsuit in December 2011, a state court ordered Chetrit to clean the air in the hotel. King &amp; Grove Hotels was hired in January 2012 to operate the hotel, and Chetrit proposed a rooftop addition shortly afterward, which the LPC approved despite concerns from residents. Chetrit was ordered to fix additional building violations in May 2012 after tenants alleged that the renovation created toxic dust and allowed mold and rust to spread. Other tenant lawsuits included a dispute over a deceased tenant&#x27;s artwork and a complaint over disrupted gas, heat, and hot water service. In addition, Chetrit sued Bard in early 2013, claiming that Bard had overrepresented the hotel&#x27;s value.

Chetrit, David Bistricer and King &amp; Grove Hotels CEO, Ed Scheetz co-owned the hotel until August 2013, when Scheetz took over the Chelsea Hotel. King &amp; Grove and existing residents agreed on a rent settlement the next month, in which residents could stay in upgraded apartments. Scheetz continued to evict other tenants who had fallen behind on rent. At the time, there were 65 remaining apartments and 170 guestrooms. Chetrit canceled all of the work permits for the Chelsea&#x27;s renovation at the end of 2013, and all work was temporarily stopped until King &amp; Grove applied for new permits. Scheetz also hired Marvel Architects to modify Kaufman&#x27;s designs, prompting a lawsuit from Kaufman.

After rebranding King &amp; Grove as Chelsea Hotels in 2014, Scheetz bought the El Quijote restaurant that year. The Chelsea Hotel Storefront Gallery also opened at ground level in 2014. Following a campaign led by residents, Scheetz agreed to preserve a first-floor suite once occupied by the poet Dylan Thomas. Scheetz also wished to renovate 52 remaining apartments, which were occupied by 83 tenants. Accordingly, he offered to buy out their apartments, move them to the lower stories, or move them temporarily to the Martha Washington Hotel. By mid-2015, Scheetz and his partners Bill Ackman, Joseph Steinberg, and Wheelock Street Capital had spent $185 million on renovations, which were not expected to be completed for two years. Scheetz had withdrawn from the Chelsea Hotel project entirely by March 2016, after a series of budget overruns and delays, although his partners retained a stake in the project.

==== BD Hotels takeover ====
BD Hotels took over the hotel&#x27;s operation that July and began working to renovate 120 of the hotel rooms, as well as restoring or preserving the apartments of 51 existing tenants. At the time, the renovation was planned to be completed in 2018. SIR Chelsea LLC, led by Sean MacPherson, Ira Drukier, and Richard Born, bought the Chelsea Hotel in October 2016 for $250 million. MacPherson led additional renovations at the hotel, including restoration of artwork and design features, as well as new public areas like a bar and spa on the roof. To convince mayor Bill de Blasio to approve further changes, Drukier and Born sent tens of thousands of dollars to various funds for de Blasio. Bard&#x27;s collection of paintings was sold off in 2017 after he died, and work was again halted that year when the city found high concentrations of lead in the dust. By then, two single room occupancy apartments remained in the Chelsea, and many tenants had temporarily relocated. Some of the hotel&#x27;s original doors were removed and sold at auction in 2018.

El Quijote was closed temporarily in March 2018 for renovations. The next year, several holdout tenants filed a lawsuit to retain control of their apartments. The renovation project was halted, and the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development mandated that the hotel&#x27;s owners obtain a certificate of no harassment. Work on the renovation had mostly stalled by early 2020 due to a harassment lawsuit against the owners, though a state judge dismissed that suit. The city government also contended that the owners had harassed the tenants, and further lawsuits were filed throughout that year. Other residents, who wanted the hotel&#x27;s renovation to be completed quickly, sided with the owners. Work resumed in early 2021, after the city government said that January that it would not pursue a tenant-harassment investigation against the owners. The hotel&#x27;s owners sued the city in May 2021, claiming that the construction delays had cost them $100 million.

El Quijote reopened in February 2022, and the Hotel Chelsea soft-reopened to transient guests the next month. Initially, the rooms were rented at a discount while work continued. The Bard Room opened at ground level in June 2022, and the hotel fully reopened in mid-2022. At the time, there were still 40 permanent residents, and the cheapest suite cost $700 per night. Disputes continued over the preservation of Dylan Thomas&#x27;s apartment, and the hotel&#x27;s owners still had an open lawsuit against the city. Café Chelsea, a French bistro, opened within the hotel in July 2023. The hotel&#x27;s neon sign and stained-glass windows, which had been removed during the 2020s renovation, were auctioned off in late 2024.

== Notable residents ==
Over the years, the Chelsea has become particularly well-known for its residents, who have come from all social classes. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the hotel in 2001 as a &quot;roof for creative heads&quot;, given the large number of such personalities who have stayed at the Chelsea; the previous year, the same newspaper had characterized the list of tenants as &quot;living history&quot;. The journalist Pete Hamill characterized the hotel&#x27;s clientele as &quot;radicals in the 1930s, British sailors in the 40s, Beats in the 50s, hippies in the 60s, decadent poseurs in the 70s&quot;. Although early tenants were wealthy, the Chelsea attracted less well-off tenants by the mid-20th century, and many writers, musicians, and artists lived at the Hotel Chelsea when they were short on money. Accordingly, the Chelsea&#x27;s guest list had almost zero overlap with that of the more fashionable Plaza Hotel crosstown.

&quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;people who lived in the hotel slept together as often as they celebrated holidays together&quot;, particularly under Stanley Bard&#x27;s tenure. Despite the high number of notable people associated with the Chelsea, its residents typically desired privacy and frowned upon those who used their relationships with their neighbors to further their own careers.

=== Literature ===
The Hotel Chelsea has housed numerous literary figures, some of whom wrote their books there. Arthur C. Clarke wrote &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; while staying at the Chelsea, calling the hotel his &quot;spiritual home&quot; despite its condition. Thomas Wolfe lived in the hotel before his death in 1938, writing several books such as &quot;You Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;; he often walked around the halls to gain inspiration for his writing. William S. Burroughs also lived at the Chelsea. While living at the Chelsea, Edgar Lee Masters wrote 18 poetry books, often wandering the hotel for hours.

Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (who lived with his wife Caitlin Thomas) was staying in room 205 when he became ill and died in 1953, while American poet Delmore Schwartz spent the last few years of his life in seclusion at the Chelsea before he died in 1966. Irish playwright and poet Brendan Behan, a severe alcoholic who had been ejected from the Algonquin Hotel, lived at the hotel for several months before his death in 1964. Many poets of the Beat poetry movement also lived at the Chelsea before the Beat Hotel in Paris became popular.

The composer George Kleinsinger lived with his pet animals on the tenth floor. The activist Stormé DeLarverie was also a long-term resident, as was the actress Candy Darling.

The Chelsea was particularly popular among rock musicians and rock and roll musicians in the 1970s. These included Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, who allegedly stabbed his girlfriend Nancy Spungen to death at the hotel in 1978; after Vicious&#x27;s death, their room was split into two units to prevent the room from being turned into a shrine. Numerous rock bands frequented the Chelsea as well, including the Allman Brothers, the Band, Big Brother and the Holding Company, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the Byrds, Country Joe and the Fish, Jefferson Airplane, Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, Moby Grape, the Mothers of Invention, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Sly and the Family Stone, and the Stooges. The Kills wrote much of their album &quot;No Wow&quot; at the Chelsea prior to its release in 2005. The Grateful Dead once performed on the roof.

=== Visual artists ===
Many visual artists, including painters, sculptors, and photographers, have resided at the Chelsea. The painter John Sloan lived in one of the top-floor duplexes until his death in 1951, painting portraits of both the Chelsea and nearby buildings. Joseph Glasco lived at the Chelsea in 1949 and then lived there on recurring visits and painted &quot;Chelsea Hotel&quot; (1992) there. During the 1960s, acolytes of the polymath Harry Everett Smith frequently gathered around his apartment. The painter Alphaeus Philemon Cole lived there for 35 years until his death in 1988 when, at the age of 112, he was the oldest verified man alive. The artist Vali Myers lived at the hotel from 1971 to 2014, while conceptual artist Bettina Grossman lived in the Chelsea from 1970 to her death in 2021.

The choreographer Katherine Dunham, who rehearsed at the hotel in the 1960s, was one of the few dance–associated figures to stay in the Chelsea. Communist Party USA leader Elizabeth Gurley Flynn lived at the hotel, as did event producer Susanne Bartsch.

Several fashion designers have lived at the Chelsea. Charles James, credited with being America&#x27;s first couturier who influenced fashion in the 1940s and 1950s, moved into the Chelsea in 1964. The designer Elizabeth Hawes lived in the Chelsea until her death in 1971. Billy Reid used one of the Chelsea&#x27;s rooms as an office, studio, and showroom starting in 1998. After returning to New York City in 2001, Natalie &quot;Alabama&quot; Chanin briefly lived in the Chelsea Hotel.

== Impact ==

=== Critical reception ===

==== Cultural commentary ====
&quot;Life&quot; magazine characterized the hotel in 1964 as &quot;New York&#x27;s most illustrious third-rate hotel&quot;; the same year, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the Chelsea Hotel as having &quot;long represented the cultural mood that is now spreading through the West 20s&quot;. Another journalist called the hotel in 1965 an &quot;Ellis Island of the avant-garde&quot;. A &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reporter said that, while the hotel was internally known as an artists&#x27; residence, &quot;those on the outside are confused by the names and the rococo facade of stories that have dragged the Chelsea down like an old roue to the bottom of history&quot;. Donna Hilts of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in 1975 that &quot;the beatnik &#x27;50s, the hip &#x27;60s, the freaky &#x27;70s—each found a way of appreciating the freedom, the tradition and the old rug coziness of the Chelsea&quot;. Paul Goldberger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1981 that the Chelsea &quot;has had a history that is something of a cross between the Algonquin Hotel and a crash pad&quot;, and British reporter Peter Ackroyd wrote in 1983 that the Chelsea was reputed as &quot;one of the least stuffy hotels in New York&quot;. A &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporter said in 1983 that the Chelsea &quot;has certainly set standards of its own&quot;.

In 1993, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Stubbornly resistant to change, the Chelsea is—still—hip.&quot; The same reporter described the hotel as a &quot;Tower of Babel of creativity and bad behavior&quot; that nonetheless remained successful. In 1995, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; contrasted the hotel with the more upscale Algonquin Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, which was also known for its literary scene. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the hotel&#x27;s lax management in 1999 as &quot;a factor that attracted a stellar crop of artists in its century of operation&quot;, while a &quot;GQ&quot; writer said the same year that &quot;there are two Statues of Liberty on New York—the one for immigrants out by Ellis Island and the one for weirdos at 222 West 23rd Street&quot;. In the 2000s, the &quot;Irish Times&quot; said that the Chelsea was &quot;reputed to be the last Bohemian place on earth&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; described the hotel as having &quot;long been synonymous with the bohemian scene&quot;, and &quot;The Advertiser&quot; of Adelaide wrote that &quot;The Chelsea exists as a microcosm of New York.&quot;

&quot;The New York Observer&quot; wrote in 2010 that the Chelsea&#x27;s &quot;hulking physicality&quot; distinguished the hotel from neighboring structures, though &quot;it&#x27;s the litany of cultural touchstones in (or formerly in) residence that makes it the Chelsea&quot;. According to &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, the hotel &quot;had something that no amount of money or interior decoration could buy: a singular style and a unique legend&quot;. Sherill Tippins said in 2022, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine what American culture would be like if we hadn&#x27;t had the Chelsea. It&#x27;s an enormous factory of creative thought and ideas.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the Christodora House in the East Village to the Hotel Chelsea, and &quot;Town and Country&quot; described the hotel as &quot;a symbol of New York City&#x27;s vibrant culture&quot;.

==== Architectural and hotel commentary ====
When the hotel was completed, a writer for the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; regarded the hotel&#x27;s &quot;finish and appointments&quot; as a &quot;very close second&quot; to that of the Navarro Flats on Central Park South, while the &quot;Courier Journal&quot; described the Chelsea as &quot;the latest triumph of civilization&quot;. According to David Goodman Croly, the building&#x27;s design signified the fact that New Yorkers had become &quot;more capable of organization, more sociable, more gregarious than before&quot;. &quot;The Sun&quot; wrote that the Chelsea was one of numerous &quot;living temples of humanity&quot; that could be used as a model for urban apartment living.

In the mid-20th century, the hotel&#x27;s decor was the subject of negative commentary. Yevgeny Yevtushenko likened the smell of his room to the Dachau concentration camp, and Arthur Miller said the decor was more akin to &quot;Guatemalan maybe, or outer Queens&quot; than a &quot;grand hotel&quot;. Donna Hilts said in 1975 that the hotel&#x27;s brick facade &quot;reminds a visitor of a Victorian dowager, down on her luck, cracked and faded, but still trying to keep up appearances&quot;. The Associated Press wrote in 1978 that the hotel&#x27;s lobby was &quot;singularly unprepossessing&quot;, with tenants&#x27; art juxtaposed with the original fireplace, while a &quot;Newsday&quot; reporter described the space as &quot;a museum of the anarchic monstrosities of the 1960s&quot;. Paul Goldberger praised the architecture but disliked its neon sign, saying that &quot;the building is so strong as a work of architecture that the sign compromises it not a bit&quot;. Ackroyd said in 1983 that his room was &quot;not particularly comfortable [but] has a grim of its own&quot;.

Terry Trucco wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1991 that her room &quot;got plenty of light and was oddly cheerful&quot;, though she described the furniture as old and the bathroom as &quot;ghastly&quot;; a writer for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said the same year that the corridors felt like &quot;an institution in long decline&quot;. A writer for &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;, reviewing the hotel in 1996, said that the rooms were large but &quot;not especially clean&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1998 that the hotel&#x27;s hallways resembled a street in Venice or Rome and that the apartments were &quot;furnished in an artistic collision of styles&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; of London called the Chelsea&#x27;s lobby &quot;an overgrown taxidermist&#x27;s Valhalla&quot; in 2000. The &quot;Poughkeepsie Journal&quot; wrote in 2002 that the Chelsea stood &quot;in the middle of the block with an air of quiet dignity&quot;, with its balconies being its most prominent feature. A &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote in 2005 that, despite the hotel&#x27;s worn-down condition, its &quot;grungy elegance&quot; was preferable to chain hotels&#x27; &quot;soulless architecture&quot;.

After the hotel reopened in 2022, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Depending on one&#x27;s nostalgist leanings, the new Hotel Chelsea is either a travesty of history, or instantly on the must-do list.&quot; A critic for &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; wrote, &quot;The design isn&#x27;t too flashy, isn&#x27;t too rock-and-roll, isn&#x27;t too homey, yet it has a lick of each of these elements.&quot; The first edition of the Michelin Keys Guide, in 2024, ranked the Hotel Chelsea as a &quot;one-key&quot; hotel, the third-highest accolade granted by the guide. The same year, &quot;Suitcase&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;the spirit of Philip Hubert&#x27;s socialist-leaning vision [was] very much alive&quot;, with many of the original architectural decorations being retained.

=== Popular culture ===

The Chelsea has been the setting or inspiration for many works of popular media. In addition, many art events and photography shoots have taken place at the hotel, and several films have been shot there as well.

==== Films and television ====
The hotel has been featured in several documentaries. Its history was chronicled in the 2008 documentary &quot;Chelsea on the Rocks&quot;, directed by Abel Ferrara, and the 2022 documentary &quot;Dreaming Walls: Inside the Chelsea Hotel&quot;, executive-produced by Martin Scorsese. An episode of the TV series &quot;An American Family&quot;, aired on PBS in 1973, was mostly filmed at the Chelsea, as was an episode of the documentary series &quot;Arena&quot;. The 1986 film &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;, by Alex Cox, chronicled the lives of residents Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen and the circumstances leading up to Spungen&#x27;s murder in the hotel.

The Chelsea has also been used as a setting for other films. Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey directed &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; (1966), a film about Warhol&#x27;s Factory regulars and their lives at the hotel, and Shirley Clarke&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;Portrait of Jason&quot; also used the hotel as a setting. Parts of Sandy Daley&#x27;s 1971 short film &quot;Robert Having His Nipple Pierced&quot; were filmed at the Chelsea on a budget of less than $2,000. Ethan Hawke directed the 2001 film &quot;Chelsea Walls&quot; about a new generation of artists living at the hotel. Other films with scenes shot at the Chelsea include &quot;Tally Brown, New York&quot; (1979); &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; (1986); &quot;Anna&quot; (1987); &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994); and the horror film &quot;Hotel Chelsea&quot; (2009).

==== Music ====
The hotel was featured in many songs. Joni Mitchell is sometimes cited as having written the song &quot;Chelsea Morning&quot; about her room in the hotel. Leonard Cohen and Janis Joplin had an affair there in 1968 (as memorialized in a plaque installed there in 2009), and Cohen later wrote the song &quot;Chelsea Hotel&quot;, as well as another version titled &quot;Chelsea Hotel No. 2&quot;, about it. Bob Dylan wrote the songs &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot; and &quot;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot; there, mentioning this in &quot;Sara&quot;. Additionally, Nico&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; is about the hotel and its inhabitants. Jorma Kaukonen wrote the song &quot;Third Week in the Chelsea&quot; for Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Bark&quot; after spending three weeks living in the Chelsea. Other songs featuring the hotel include &quot;Midnight in Chelsea&quot; by Bon Jovi, &quot;Hotel Chelsea Nights&quot; by Ryan Adams, &quot;Chelsea Hotel &#x27;78&quot; by Alejandro Escovedo, and &quot;Bruce Wayne Campbell Interviewed on the Roof of the Chelsea Hotel, 1979&quot; by Okkervil River, and &quot;The Tortured Poets Department&quot; by Taylor Swift.

==== Print media ====
Stillman Foster Kneeland wrote a poem in 1914, &quot;Roofland&quot;, which commemorated the nights that he spent on the Chelsea&#x27;s roof garden. Similarly, Edgar Lee Masters wrote an ode to the hotel while living there. Arthur Miller wrote a short piece, &quot;The Chelsea Affect&quot;, describing life at the Chelsea Hotel in the early 1960s. Nicolaia Rips wrote the memoir &quot;Trying to Float: Coming of Age in the Chelsea Hotel&quot; in 2016.

The hotel has been the subject of several nonfiction accounts and photographical books. Robert Baral&#x27;s 1965 book &quot;Turn West on 23rd&quot; devoted a chapter to the hotel, while Claudio Edinger&#x27;s 1983 book &quot;Chelsea Hotel&quot; consisted of photographs of the hotel and its residents. Florence Turner&#x27;s 1987 book &quot;At the Chelsea&quot; doubled as a memoir and a description of the hotel&#x27;s occupants. Ed Hamilton, who moved into the Chelsea in 1995, launched the &quot;Living with Legends&quot; blog about the hotel in 2005; information from that blog was collated in the 2007 book &quot;Legends of the Chelsea Hotel&quot;. The hotel was also described in Sherill Tippins&#x27;s 2013 book &quot;Inside the Dream Palace&quot;, as well as Victoria Cohen&#x27;s 2013 coffee table book &quot;Hotel Chelsea&quot;. In 2019, the photographer Colin Miller published the book &quot;Hotel Chelsea: Living in the Last Bohemian Haven&quot;, which included pictures of the remaining apartments&#x27; interiors.

Several pieces of fiction have been set at the hotel, such as Stuart Cloete&#x27;s 1947 short story &quot;The Blast&quot;, describing New York City after a nuclear holocaust. Henry Van Dyke&#x27;s 1969 book &quot;Blood of Strawberries&quot;, a black comedy, revolved around a group of fictional bohemians who lived at the hotel. Dee Dee Ramone wrote the book &quot;Chelsea Horror Hotel&quot; in 2001, and Fiona Davis used it as a setting in her 2019 novel &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot;. Joseph O&#x27;Neill wrote the novel &quot;Netherland&quot; partly based on his experience living at the hotel.

==== Other works ====
The Chelsea hosted a multimedia festival in 1989, &quot;At the Chelsea&quot;, which celebrated the hotel&#x27;s history with theatrical shows, music, and performance art. Nicole Burdette&#x27;s play &quot;Chelsea Walls&quot;, first performed in 1990, was the basis for the similarly-named 2001 film. In 2013, Welsh choreographers Jessica Cohen and Jim Ennis choreographed a dance piece inspired by the Chelsea Hotel; the piece depicts four fictional couples, who are loosely based on real-life hotel residents. The multimedia performance &quot;Young Artists at the Chelsea&quot;, dramatizing the lives of some of the residents, was presented in a gallery in the hotel in 2015.

<text>Aristid Lindenmayer (17 November 1925 – 30 October 1989) was a Hungarian biologist. In 1968 he developed a type of formal language today called L-systems or Lindenmayer systems. Using those systems Lindenmayer modelled the behaviour of cells of plants. L-systems nowadays are also used to model whole plants.
Lindenmayer worked with yeast and filamentous fungi and studied the growth patterns of various types of algae, such as the blue/green bacteria &quot;Anabaena catenula&quot;. Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.

==Career==
Lindenmayer studied chemistry and biology at the Eötvös Loránd University of Budapest from 1943 to 1948. He received his Ph.D. in plant physiology in
1956 at the University of Michigan. In 1968 he became professor in Philosophy of Life Sciences and Biology at the University of Utrecht, The Netherlands. From 1972 onward he headed the Theoretical Biology Group at Utrecht University.

<text>A calliope (see below for pronunciation) is a North American musical instrument that produces sound by sending a gas, originally steam or, more recently, compressed air, through large whistles—originally locomotive whistles.

A calliope is typically very loud. Even some small calliopes are audible for miles. There is no way to vary tone or volume. Musically, the only expression possible is the pitch, rhythm, and duration of the notes.

The steam calliope is also known as a steam [[Pipe organ|organ]] ( in Quebec) or steam piano ( in Quebec). The air-driven calliope is sometimes called a calliaphone, the name given to it by Norman Baker, but the &quot;Calliaphone&quot; name is registered by the Miner Company for instruments produced under the Tangley name.

In the age of steam, the steam calliope was particularly used on riverboats and in circuses. In both cases, a steam supply was readily available for other purposes. Riverboats supplied steam from their propulsion boilers. Circus calliopes were sometimes installed in steam-driven carousels, or supplied with steam from a traction engine. The traction engine could also supply electric power for lighting, and tow the calliope in the circus parade, where it traditionally came last. Other circus calliopes were self-contained, mounted on a carved, painted and gilded wagon pulled by horses, but the presence of other steam boilers in the circus meant that fuel and expertise to run the boiler were readily available. Steam instruments often had keyboards made from brass. This was in part to resist the heat and moisture of the steam, but also for the golden shine of the highly polished keys.

Calliopes can be played by a player at a keyboard or mechanically. Mechanical operation may be by a drum similar to a music box drum, or by a roll similar to that of a player piano. Some instruments have both a keyboard and a mechanism for automated operation, others only one or the other. Some calliopes can also be played via a MIDI interface.

The whistles of a calliope are tuned to a chromatic scale, although this process is difficult and must be repeated often to maintain quality sound. Since the pitch of each note is largely affected by the temperature of the steam, accurate tuning is nearly impossible; however, the off-pitch notes (particularly in the upper register) have become something of a trademark of the steam calliope. A calliope may have anywhere from 25 to 67 whistles, but 32 is traditional for a steam calliope.

==History==

Joshua C. Stoddard of Worcester, Massachusetts patented the calliope on October 9, 1855, though his design echoes previous concepts, such as an 1832 instrument called a &quot;steam trumpet,&quot; later known as a train whistle. In 1851, William Hoyt of Dupont, Indiana claimed to have conceived of a device similar to Stoddard&#x27;s calliope, but he never patented it. Later, an employee of Stoddard&#x27;s American Music, Arthur S. Denny, attempted to market an &quot;Improved Kalliope&quot; in Europe, but it did not catch on. In 1859, he demonstrated this instrument in Crystal Palace, London. Unlike other calliopes before or since, Denny&#x27;s Improved Kalliope let the player control the steam pressure, and therefore the volume of the music, while playing.

While Stoddard originally intended the calliope to replace bells at churches, it found its way onto riverboats during the paddlewheel era. While only a small number of working steamboats still exist, each has a steam calliope. These boats include the &quot;Delta Queen&quot;, the &quot;Belle of Louisville&quot;, and &quot;President&quot;. Their calliopes are played regularly on river excursions. Many surviving calliopes were built by Thomas J. Nichol, Cincinnati, Ohio, who built calliopes from 1890 until 1932. The Thomas J. Nichol calliopes featured rolled sheet copper (as used in roofing) for the resonant tube (the bell) of the whistle, lending a sweeter tone than cast bronze or brass, which were the usual materials for steam whistles of the day. David Morecraft pioneered a resurgence in the building of authentic steam calliopes of the Thomas J. Nichol style beginning in 1985 in Peru, Indiana. These calliopes are featured in Peru&#x27;s annual Circus City Parade. Morecraft died on December 5, 2016.

Stoddard&#x27;s original calliope was attached to a metal roller set with pins in the manner familiar to Stoddard from the contemporary clockwork music box. The pins on the roller opened valves that admitted steam into the whistles. Later, Stoddard replaced the cylinder with a keyboard, so that the calliope could be played like an organ.

Starting in the 1900s calliopes began using music rolls instead of a live musician. The music roll operated in a manner similar to a piano roll in a player piano, mechanically operating the keys. Many of these mechanical calliopes retained keyboards, allowing a live musician to play them if needed. During this period, compressed air began to replace steam as the vehicle of producing sound.

Most calliopes disappeared in the mid-20th century, as steam power was replaced with other power sources. Without the demand for technicians that mines and railroads supplied, no support was available to keep boilers running. Only a few calliopes have survived, which, unless converted to a modern power source, are rarely played.

A relatively recently-built calliope is that of Carl Bergman of Aspen, Colorado, which was built in the mid 1970s. The 6 foot tall wood-fired steam boiler was originally used by miners at Independence Pass and requires its owner to maintain a boiler operator&#x27;s license. The calliope produces 10 notes and takes 8 hours to get ready.

==Pronunciation==

The pronunciation of the word has long been disputed, and often it is pronounced differently inside and outside the groups that use it. The Greek muse by the same name is pronounced , but the instrument was usually pronounced by people who played it.
 A nineteenth-century magazine, &quot;Reedy&#x27;s Mirror&quot;, attempted to settle the dispute by publishing this rhyme:
This, in turn, came from a poem by Vachel Lindsay, called &quot;The Kallyope Yell&quot;,
in which Lindsay uses both pronunciations.

In the song &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot;, written in 1972, Bruce Springsteen used the four-syllable ( ) pronunciation commonly used in the United States when referring to a fairground organ; this was also used by the British Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band in their 1976 cover.

==Related instruments==

===Pyrophone===
The pyrophone is a calliope-like instrument that uses internal combustion within its whistles to power their notes, rather than the calliope&#x27;s system of friction from steam going through ducts.

At 1998&#x27;s Burning Man, a pyrophone referred to as &quot;Satan&#x27;s Calliope&quot; was powered by ignition of propane inside resonant cavities.

===Calliaphone===
The calliaphone is a compressed-air powered, easily transported instrument developed by early 20th century American inventor Norman Baker.

===Lustre chantant===
The &quot;lustre chantant&quot; (literally &quot;singing chandelier&quot;) or musical lamp was invented by Frederik Kastner. It was a large chandelier with glass pipes of varying lengths each illuminated and heated by an individual gas jet. A keyboard allowed the player to turn down individual jets; as the glass tube cooled, a note was produced. Kastner installed several such instruments in Paris.

==Popular culture==
Henry Mancini used the calliope in his 1961 song &quot;Baby Elephant Walk&quot; for the film &quot;Hatari!&quot; to suggest the fun of a circus.

A calliope in a travelling circus plays an important role in (1966, episodes 4 and 5, &quot;Old Man Out&quot;). Its music serves as background for the diversionary circus stunts central to the episode&#x27;s mission.

The Beatles, in recording &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; from the 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band,&quot; used tapes of calliope music to create the atmosphere of a circus. Beatles producer George Martin recalled, &quot;When we first worked on &#x27;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&#x27; John had said that he wanted to &#x27;smell the sawdust on the floor&#x27;, wanted to taste the atmosphere of the circus. I said to him, &#x27;What we need is a calliope.&#x27; &#x27;A what?&#x27; &#x27;Steam whistles, played by a keyboard. Unable to find an authentic calliope, Martin resorted to tapes of calliopes playing Sousa marches. &quot;[I] chopped the tapes up into small sections and had Geoff Emerick throw them up into the air, re-assembling them at random.&quot;

In the 1972 western film &quot;The Great Northfield, Minnesota Raid&quot;, which takes place in 1876, a calliope is featured prominently during a scene when Cole Younger (portrayed by Cliff Robertson) and his gang arrive in Northfield, Minnesota. The instrument is referred to by name and Younger shows such interest in it that he attempts to fix it.

In the video game &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, the calliope is prominently used as a quasi-bass line in the #11 track &quot;Haunted Fortress 2&quot; in the game&#x27;s soundtrack, used mostly during Halloween or Full Moon-timed events.

<text>The Obotrites (, &quot;Abodritorum&quot;, &quot;Abodritos&quot;) or Obodrites, also spelled Abodrites (), were a confederation of medieval West Slavic tribes within the territory of modern Mecklenburg and Holstein in northern Germany (see Polabian Slavs). For decades, they were allies of Charlemagne in his wars against the Germanic Saxons and the Slavic Veleti. The Obotrites under Prince Thrasco defeated the Saxons in the Battle of Bornhöved (798). The still-Pagan Saxons were dispersed by the emperor, and the part of their former land in Holstein north of Elbe was awarded to the Obotrites in 804, as a reward for their victory. This however was soon reverted through an invasion of the Danes. The Obotrite regnal style was abolished in 1167, when Pribislav was restored to power by Duke Henry the Lion, as Prince of Mecklenburg, thereby founding the Germanized House of Mecklenburg.

==Obotritic confederation==
The Bavarian Geographer, an anonymous medieval document compiled in Regensburg in 830, contains a list of the tribes in Central Eastern Europe to the east of the Elbe. The list includes the Nortabtrezi (Obotrites) - with 53 &quot;civitates&quot;.
Adam of Bremen referred to them as the Reregi because of their lucrative trade emporium Reric. In common with other Slavic groups, they were often described by Germanic sources as Wends.

The main tribes of the Obotritic confederation were:

*the Obotrites proper (Wismar Bay to Lake Schwerin);
*the Wagrians (the eastern Holstein as part of Saxony);
*the Warnower (the upper Warnow and Mildenitz);
*the Polabians proper (between the Trave and the Elbe).

Other tribes associated with the confederation include:
*the Linonen near Lenzen,
*the Travnjane near the Trave,
*the Drevani in the Hanoverian Wendland.
*the Ukrani in Prenzlau.

==History==

As allies of the Carolingian kings and the empire of their Ottonian successors, the Obotrites fought from 808 to 1200 against the kings of Denmark, who wished to rule the Baltic region independently of the empire. When opportunities arose, for instance upon the death of an emperor, they would seek to seize power; and in 983 Hamburg was destroyed by the Obotrites under their king, Mstivoj. At times they levied tribute from the Danes and Saxons. Under the leadership of Niklot, they resisted a Christian assault during the Wendish Crusade.

German missionaries such as Vicelinus converted the Obotrites to Christianity. In 1170 they acknowledged the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire, leading to Germanisation and assimilation over the following centuries. However, up to the late 15th century most villagers in the Obotritic area were still speaking Slavic dialects (Polabian language), although subsequently their language was displaced by German. The Polabian language survived until the beginning of the 19th century in Hanoverian Wendland, eastern Lower Saxony (bordering modern Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania).
The ruling clan of the Obotrites kept its power throughout the Germanisation and ruled their country (except during a short interruption in Thirty Years&#x27; War) as House of Mecklenburg until the end of monarchies in Germany in November Revolution 1918. Previously, the Obodrites were dominated by the Naconids; Eastern (Far) Pomerania was ruled by the Pomeranian House (Grifichi).

==List of Obotrite leaders==

The rulers of Obotrite lands were later the dukes and grand dukes of Mecklenburg.

She has lived in London since 2002 and was appointed an honorary Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2016 for her services to drama.

==Early life==
Gillian Leigh Anderson was born in Chicago on August 9, 1968, the daughter of computer analyst and neurofibromatosis support group leader Rosemary &quot;Posie&quot; Alyce (née Lane) and film editing company owner Homer Edward &quot;Ed&quot; Anderson III. Soon after her birth, her parents moved to Puerto Rico for 15 months before relocating to London so her father could attend the London Film School. She lived in Crouch End and Harringay, and attended Coleridge Primary School. When she was 11 years old, her family returned to the US and settled in Grand Rapids, Michigan, maintaining an apartment in London and spending their summers there. Having always intended to return to London, she later moved there in 2002. In Grand Rapids, she attended Fountain Elementary and City High-Middle School. She later said of her time there, &quot;We were in a small Republican town. There were only six punks there. We were weird. It&#x27;s not like London.&quot;

Anderson is the eldest of three siblings. Her brother Aaron, who was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis, died in 2011 of a brain tumor at the age of 30. He was a DJ, mentor, and practicing Buddhist, and was in his second year of a PhD program in developmental psychology at Stanford University when he was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2008. Her sister Zoe is a ceramicist, whom she has called &quot;an exceptional artist&quot;. Anderson went through a rebellious stage as a teenager in Grand Rapids, taking drugs, dating a much older boyfriend, and cultivating a punk appearance (dying her hair various colors, shaving the sides of her head, sporting a nose piercing and an all-black wardrobe). She was put in therapy at the age of 14. She listened to bands like Dead Kennedys and Skinny Puppy. She was voted by her classmates as &quot;class clown&quot;, &quot;most bizarre girl&quot;, and &quot;most likely to be arrested&quot;. She was indeed arrested on graduation night for breaking into her high school in an attempt to glue the locks of the doors shut. She later managed to reduce the charges from breaking and entering to trespassing.

Anderson was interested in marine biology at an early age, but later became more interested in theatre and began acting in high school productions during her first year and later in community theatre. She also served as a student intern at the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre &amp; School of Theatre Arts. After graduating from high school in 1986, she returned to her birthplace of Chicago to attend The Theatre School at DePaul University, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1990. She also participated in the American National Theater and Academy&#x27;s summer program at Cornell University. To support herself financially during her student years, she worked at the Goose Island Brewery in Chicago. After she became famous, the brewery named one of their Belgian-style farmhouse ales &quot;Gillian&quot;.

==Career==
===1990s===

Anderson moved to New York City at the age of 22 and worked as a waitress to support herself. She began her career in Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s play &quot;Absent Friends&quot; at the Manhattan Theatre Club alongside Brenda Blethyn; for her role she won the 1990–91 Theatre World Award for &quot;Best Newcomer&quot;. Her next theatrical role was in Christopher Hampton&#x27;s &quot;The Philanthropist&quot; at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut.

Anderson moved to Los Angeles in 1992 and spent a year auditioning. The same year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, &quot;The Turning&quot;, starring Karen Allen and Tess Harper. The film drama is an adaptation of the play &quot;Home Fires Burning&quot;.

Although she had once vowed she would never do television work, being out of work for a year changed her mindset. Anderson recalled: &quot;First of all, I swore I&#x27;d never move to Los Angeles, and once I did, I swore I&#x27;d never do television. It was only after being out of work for almost a year that I began going in [to auditions] on some stuff that I would pray that I wouldn&#x27;t get because I didn&#x27;t want to be involved in it.&quot; She broke into mainstream television in 1993 with a guest appearance on the collegiate drama, &quot;Class of &#x27;96&quot;, on the fledgling Fox Network.

As a result of this guest appearance, Anderson was sent the script for &quot;The X-Files&quot;. She was 24 when she decided to audition because, &quot;for the first time in a long time, the script involved a strong, independent, intelligent woman as a lead character.&quot; Producer Chris Carter wanted to hire her, but Fox wanted someone with previous television exposure and greater sex appeal. Fox sent in more actresses, but Carter stood by Anderson, and she was eventually cast as FBI Special Agent Dana Scully. Filmed for the first five seasons in Vancouver, British Columbia, before moving to Los Angeles, the series ran for nine seasons. Two related films were also produced, released in 1998 and 2008. During her time on &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Anderson won numerous awards for her portrayal of Special Agent Scully, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Series Drama, two Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series and a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television. Anderson is the first actress to win an Emmy, a Golden Globe, and a SAG Award in the same year. For the role, she received a total of four Emmy nominations, four Golden Globe nominations and nine SAG nominations.

Anderson was the first woman to write and direct an episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; (&quot;all things&quot;). During its run – between the fifth and sixth seasons – Anderson co-starred in &quot;The X-Files: Fight the Future&quot;, a 1998 film that continued &quot;The X-Files&quot; storyline. Anderson also provided the voice for a parody of her Scully character in &quot;The Springfield Files&quot;, an episode of the animated comedy television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. While filming &quot;The X-Files&quot;, she met assistant art director Clyde Klotz, who became her first husband. Anderson&#x27;s character on &quot;The X-Files&quot; initiated a phenomenon referred to as &quot;The Scully Effect&quot;; as the medical doctor and the FBI Special Agent inspired many young women to pursue careers in science, medicine, and law enforcement. It contributed to the increase in the number of women in those fields. &quot;The Scully Effect&quot; remains a subject of academic inquiry.

In 1996, Anderson narrated the television documentaries &quot;Spies Above&quot; and &quot;Why Planes Go Down&quot;. While hosting the BBC documentary series &quot;Future Fantastic&quot;, she became impressed by the theme music of the show, by the electronic duo Hal and initiated a collaboration with them. In 1997, Anderson provided spoken word vocals and starred in the music video for their single &quot;Extremis&quot;, which was frequently aired on MTV. She also helped to assemble an album of electronic music, &quot;Future: A Journey Through The Electronic Underground&quot;, for Virgin Records, which won praise from European music critics.

In 1997, Anderson appeared in the independent film &quot;Chicago Cab&quot;. In 1998, she starred in the film &quot;Playing by Heart&quot;. Anderson also had a supporting role in the film &quot;The Mighty&quot;. In 1999, Anderson had a supporting role in the English-language release of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;, where she voiced the character of Moro. Anderson is a fan of Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki&#x27;s work. She also took part in Eve Ensler&#x27;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;.

In 2004, Anderson starred in the Royal Court Theatre&#x27;s production of Rebecca Gilman&#x27;s play &quot;The Sweetest Swing in Baseball&quot;, as artist Dana Fielding who assumes the personality of the troubled baseball player Darryl Strawberry – a role for which she earned rave reviews.

The same year she also appeared in &quot;A Cock and Bull Story&quot; with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon – a film version of the novel &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. In 2006, Anderson won the Broadcasting Press Guild Television and Radio Award for Best Actress for her role in &quot;Bleak House&quot;. She was nominated for a British Academy Television Award (BAFTA) for Best Actress, she also received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie, a nomination for a Golden Globe, a Satellite Award nomination, and came in second place in the Best Actress category of the 2005 BBC Drama website poll for her portrayal of Lady Dedlock in the adaptation.

During 2006 and 2007, Anderson appeared in two British films: &quot;The Last King of Scotland&quot; (2006) and &quot;Straightheads&quot; (2007).

She won the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Award for Best Actress and received her second Laurence Olivier Award nomination for Best Actress. The production became the fastest-selling show in the theatre&#x27;s history, and the run was extended by two weeks due to the demand for tickets.

In March 2012, Anderson revealed to &quot;Out&quot; magazine that she had a long-term relationship with a girl while in high school. She also told &quot;CBS News&quot; that she had dated other women, though most of her relationships had been with men. In December 2014, she described herself to the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; as &quot;an actively heterosexual woman who celebrates however people want to express their sexuality&quot;. She reiterated this in an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; the following month. In an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in March 2015, she said she was open to the idea of entering another same-sex relationship: &quot;To me a relationship is about loving another human being; their gender is irrelevant.&quot; She told &quot;The Times&quot; in February 2018, &quot;I could be with a woman next year [...] It&#x27;s just who I am. I have absolutely no issue with it whatsoever, and I don&#x27;t really care if other people have an issue with it.&quot; On &quot;Watch What Happens&quot; with Andy Cohen, she said that the last time she had been with a woman was when she moved to New York City right after college.

===Hobbies and interests===
Due to her upbringing in both the United States and United Kingdom, Anderson is and can easily switch between an American or English accent depending on the situation.

During an interview with BlogTalkRadio in May 2013, she discussed her national identity: &quot;I&#x27;ve been asked whether I feel more like a Brit than an American and I don&#x27;t know what the answer to that question is. I know that I feel that London is home and I&#x27;m very happy with that as my home. I love London as a city and I feel very comfortable there. In terms of identity, I&#x27;m still a bit baffled.&quot; In a September 2024 interview with the BBC, Anderson elaborated further stating: &quot;My cells are American, but my soul is British&quot;.

She told &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine in August 2014, &quot;I have feminist bones and when I hear things or see people react to women in certain ways I have very little tolerance.&quot; She has several tattoos, all of them, as she described, are in some way about &quot;peace of mind, right mind, right action&quot;.

<doc id="42245" wikidata="Q35603" url="?curid=42245" title="Sudovian language">
<text>Sudovian (also known as Yotvingian, or Jatvingian) was a West Baltic language of Northeastern Europe. Sudovian was closely related to Old Prussian. It was formerly spoken southwest of the Neman river in what is now Lithuania, east of Galindia and in the north of Yotvingia, and by exiles in East Prussia.

==Name==
The language is referred to as Yotvingian, Jatvingian or Sudovian. Those names are derived from the southern- and northernmost tribes living in the area. When the Germans learnt the name &quot;Sudovian&quot; from the Prussians, they got to know the name of the northernmost tribe only, while Poles in the south met a tribe calling itself Yatvingian. Both Germans and Poles generalized the terms for all the Baltic inhabitants of the area.

The territory they lived in is referred to as Sudovia [Sunderland], Jotva [Jettwen], Dainavia, or Pollexia.

==Classification==
Sudovian was an Indo-European language belonging to the Baltic branch. There are several proposals for the classification of the Sudovian language within the Baltic phylum.
* Bezzenberg postulated that Sudovian was a southern Lithuanian dialect.
* Otrębski claimed it to be a transitional language between East and West Baltic.
* Some consider it a distinct West Baltic language close to Old Prussian.
* Others view it as an Old Prussian dialect.

Historical sources state that Sudovian was very similar to and mutually intelligible with the archaic Old Prussian language, e.g. in the introduction to the first Old Prussian Catechism (printed in Königsberg – 1545 – the first Baltic language book):

 &lt;br&gt;– &quot;But the Sudovians, although their speech is somewhat lower, understand this Prussian language, as it is printed in the Catechism, and they express themselves well and understand every word&quot;.

In addition to similarities in the scarce material in the Western Baltic languages, this leads most linguists to the conclusion, that Sudovian belongs to the Western Baltic branch. Sudovian along with Old Prussian was later influenced by Gothic, while most of the East Baltic languages had more contact with Finnic languages.

==History==
Sudovia and neighboring Galindia were two Baltic tribes or nations mentioned by the Greek geographer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD as &quot; and &quot; (, ).

Peter of Dusburg, in his 14th-century &quot;Chronicon terrae Prussiae&quot;, refers to Sudovia and to its inhabitants as &quot;Sudovites&quot;, listing them as one of the Prussian tribes. He attests, that between 1,500 and 1,600 Sudavians were forcefully relocated to Sambia in the late 13th century.

After the district was conquered by the Teutonic Knights, the language died out and its speakers were gradually absorbed by German, Lithuanian and Slavic populations.

John Poliander wrote in 1535 about the Sudovians living near Königsberg, Prussia, that 32 villages used &quot;Sudini speech&quot; in a 6–7 mile stretch of land of the Samland Corner that bears the name of Sudavia. They spoke a language similar to the Old Prussian language, but they used the term for amber, not the Sambian (Old Prussian) term. From him we learn that the Sudovians lived secluded from the Sambians, that they married within their own tribe, and did not allow intermarriage with the neighbouring Prussian population &quot;even if begged&quot;. They stubbornly held to their own traditions, and wore finger and ear rings with bronze bells and silver belts. Nothing was imported from abroad, but everything was produced by local craftsmen.

Christoph Hartknoch reported in 1684 that there were still Sudovians in Sambia.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Based on onomastics, Sudovian is thought to have had the following consonants:
* Compared to other Baltic languages, , , , , , and were depalatalized.
* A Partial depalatalization of , , , and took place.
* and turned into and respectively.

===Vowels===
====Diphthongs====
Two diphthongs are attested:

*Along with Prussian, Sudovian preserved Proto-Baltic , unlike the East Baltic languages, where it shifted to .

The few grammatical features proposed for the Sudovian languages are either based on supposed Sudovian substrate in other languages or based on the Polish-Yotvingian Vocabulary (it is unsure, whether or not it represents Sudovian). Therefore, few can be said with certainty.

The language seems to have preserved many archaic features, which have been lost in other Baltic languages. The language from the vocabulary retained the Proto-Baltic singular neuter case endings (as did Prussian), leaving the language with three genders.

The language has six grammatical cases: nominative, vocative (The vocative example is &quot; form the Sudovian Book), accusative, genitive, dative and locative, and a complex morphology with a variety of moods. It was a frontier dialect of Old Baltic, which preserved many archaic features which had been lost in the Middle Baltic group.

==Corpus of the Sudovian language==
===Onomastics===
The Constit. Synod. Evangel. of 1530 contains the following list of deities who were still worshipped by the Sudavians in Samland: &quot;Occopirmus, Sualxtix, Ausschauts, Autrympus, Potrympus, Bardoayts, Piluuytis, Parcunas, Pecols&quot;...&quot;.

Toponyms from north-eastern Poland, north-western Belarus, and Lithuania also preserve words.

===Evidence from other languages===
The Yotvingian territories were later overrun and populated by Slavs around present-day Białystok and Suwałki in north-eastern Poland and nearby Hrodna (formerly Grodno) in Belarus. Some elements of Baltic speech are still retained in the Belarus and Ukraine territory, owing to the sparse indigenous populations and resettlements of refugees from Lithuania. The dialect of Zietela (, , , ) was of particular interest. Kazlauskas suggested that the word &quot;mėnas&quot; (&quot;month&quot;) (dative singular &quot;mënui&quot;) encountered in dialects (Zietela, Lazdijai) and in the writings of Bretkūnas is a remnant of nouns with the stem suffix -s. The dialect of Druskininkai in Lithuania, too, was influenced by the Sudovian language.

===Fragmentary texts===
There are also some Sudovian language phrases in &quot;&quot;Warhafftige Beschreibung der Sudawen auff Samland sambt ihren Bock heyligen und Ceremonien&quot;&quot; – True Description of the Sudovians in Samland together with their goat sanctifications and ceremonies – written in the mid-16th century by Hieronymus Maletius. Most scholars view these texts as representing Old Prussian, while Norbertas Vėlius regards them as genuine Sudovian.

===Polish-Yotvingian vocabulary===
Until the 1970s, Yotvingian was chiefly known from toponyms and medieval Russian sources. But in 1978, a monument with Yotvingian writing was discovered by accident. In Belarus, a young man named Viačasłaŭ Zinaŭ, an amateur collector, bought a book of Catholic prayers from an old man from village in the depths of Białowieża Forest, which held a small manuscript titled &quot;&quot; (). It was written partly in Polish, and partly in an unspecified, &quot;pagan&quot; language. However, Zinov&#x27;s parents threw away the book. But, before the manuscript was destroyed, Zinov had made notes of it which he sent to Vilnius University in 1983. Even though Zinov&#x27;s notes were riddled with errors, it has been proven beyond doubt that the notes are indeed a copy of an authentic Yotvingian text. According to the first person who analyzed the manuscript, Zigmas Zinkevičius, this short Yotvingian–Polish dictionary (of just 215 words), &quot;Pagan Dialects from Narew&quot;, appears to have been written by a Catholic priest in order to preach to locals in their mother tongue. Concerning the language, Zinkevičius put forth three possible versions: 
* a Yotvingian dialect under a heavy influence of Lithuanian;
* Lithuanian words over a strong Yotvingian substratum;
* the compiler of the dictionary could not tell Lithuanian from Yotvingian clearly, and may have included words from both. The latter version is indirectly supported by the name of the document: &quot;Dialects&quot;, rather than &quot;Dialect&quot;. Some scholars did not rule out the possibility of forgery, but there are strong indications it was not.

<doc id="42248" wikidata="Q2527641" url="?curid=42248" title="Standard American">
<text>Standard American is a bidding system for the game of bridge widely used in North America and elsewhere. Owing to the popularization of the game by Charles Goren in the 1940s and 1950s, its early versions were sometimes referred to simply as &#x27;Goren&#x27;. With the addition and evolution of various and , it is now more generally referred to as Standard American. It is a bidding system based on five-card majors and a strong notrump; players may add conventions and refine the meanings of bids through partnership agreements summarized in their convention card. One standardised version, SAYC (Standard American Yellow Card), is widely used by casual partnerships and in online bridge.

==Role of bidding systems==

The purpose of bidding during the auction phase of each deal is to disclose information which one&#x27;s partner may employ in order to arrive at an optimal contract while concurrently contending with the opponents&#x27; attempts to do likewise. A bidding system is a set of agreements about the meanings of the different bids that the players use. Each bid provides information about the hand&#x27;s high-card strength and suit distribution based on hand evaluation techniques.

==History==

&quot;Standard American&quot; was the label given to the bridge bidding system developed by Charles Goren and his contemporaries in the 1940s. This system employed the 1915 point-count method to evaluate the strength of a bridge hand. Most bids had fairly specific requirements regarding hand strength and suit distribution. This point-count system became so popular that most bridge players, social and tournament players alike, used it. American bridge teams in the late 1930s and 1940s won world championships using Standard American.

Modifications began to appear from the 1950s forward. Before the year 2000, new bidding systems evolved, including &quot;2/1 Game Forcing&quot; which are otherwise substantial departures from early Standard American methods. Most tournament pairs now assemble their own system from a variety of new treatments and conventions that have evolved. The nearest thing to a common system in tournament play is the &quot;Standard American Yellow Card&quot; (SAYC) promulgated by the American Contract Bridge League. SAYC is widely used in internet bridge play, but only rarely in on-site tournament play.

==Most common elements==

The essential common elements of modern Standard American systems are:
* Hand evaluation based on the 4-3-2-1 point count system (Ace = 4, King = 3, Queen = 2 and Jack = 1) with adjustments for the location of honors and suit distribution.
* A hand-strength requirement of at least 12-13 points to open 1-of-a-suit. 
* Five-card majors: opening a major suit promises at least a five-card holding in that suit.
* Weak two bids: Two diamond, heart or spade openers are made with a sound six-card suit in a hand without enough overall strength to open 1 of the suit.
* Strong two clubs: All unbalanced hands too strong to open at the one-level are opened with an artificial 2 call, as well as balanced hands stronger than 21 HCP.
* Pre-emptive opening bids: Suit openings above the two level are pre-emptive, promising a long and strong suit.
* Limit Raises: A jump-raise of the opener&#x27;s suit by responder, in the absence of opponent interference, is invitational to game. In Goren&#x27;s system, this was a strong game-forcing raise.
* Notrump openers show a balanced hand, with the following common high card point (HCP) ranges:
** 1NT = 15-17 HCP
** 2NT = 20-21 HCP
** 3NT = 25-27 HCP
* Common notrump follow-up conventions include Stayman, Jacoby transfers and Gerber.

==SAYC==
The Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC) is a set of partnership agreements summarized in a convention card created by the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) to be used as the required bidding system in specified events or as a base for a casual or online partnerships. Some of the specific agreements in Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC) that elaborate on or depart from more current Standard American bidding are:
* A 2 response to a 1NT opening is specified as the &quot;non-forcing&quot; version of the Stayman convention.
* A 2 response to a 1NT is a relay to the minors when responder holds a long (at least six card length) minor suit and a weak hand; opener bids 3 and responder either passes or corrects to 3 which opener is expected to pass.
* Straight Blackwood is used and not the Roman Key Card Blackwood or other variation.
* In response to a 2 opening, the 2 response is the &quot;waiting&quot; version of that response.
* In response to a weak-two opening, RONF (&quot;Raise Only Non-Force&quot;) is used.
* The Jacoby 2NT is used to show a game-forcing raise of a major suit with four-card support.
* Negative doubles are used through the level of 2.
* Fourth suit forcing is used.
* Michaels cuebid and Unusual notrump are used.
* Conventions are specified as being &quot;off&quot; in response to a 1NT overcall, except that 2 is still Stayman.

<doc id="42253" wikidata="Q172491" url="?curid=42253" title="Data mining">
<text>Data mining is the process of extracting and finding patterns in massive data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the &quot;knowledge discovery in databases&quot; process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.

The term &quot;data mining&quot; is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (&quot;mining&quot;) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. Often the more general terms (&quot;large scale&quot;) &quot;data analysis&quot; and &quot;analytics&quot;—or, when referring to actual methods, &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; and &quot;machine learning&quot;—are more appropriate.

The actual data mining task is the semi- or automatic analysis of massive quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.

The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.

The related terms &quot;data dredging&quot;, &quot;data fishing&quot;, and &quot;data snooping&quot; refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.

==Etymology==
In the 1960s, statisticians and economists used terms like &quot;data fishing&quot; or &quot;data dredging&quot; to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an a-priori hypothesis. The term &quot;data mining&quot; was used in a similarly critical way by economist Michael Lovell in an article published in the &quot;Review of Economic Studies&quot; in 1983. Lovell indicates that the practice &quot;masquerades under a variety of aliases, ranging from &quot;experimentation&quot; (positive) to &quot;fishing&quot; or &quot;snooping&quot; (negative).

The term &quot;data mining&quot; appeared around 1990 in the database community, with generally positive connotations. For a short time in 1980s, the phrase &quot;database mining&quot;™, was used, but since it was trademarked by HNC, a San Diego–based company, to pitch their Database Mining Workstation; researchers consequently turned to &quot;data mining&quot;. Other terms used include &quot;data archaeology&quot;, &quot;information harvesting&quot;, &quot;information discovery&quot;, &quot;knowledge extraction&quot;, etc. Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro coined the term &quot;knowledge discovery in databases&quot; for the first workshop on the same topic (KDD-1989) and this term became more popular in the AI and machine learning communities. However, the term data mining became more popular in the business and press communities. Currently, the terms &quot;data mining&quot; and &quot;knowledge discovery&quot; are used interchangeably.

==Background==
The manual extraction of patterns from data has occurred for centuries. Early methods of identifying patterns in data include Bayes&#x27; theorem (1700s) and regression analysis (1800s). The proliferation, ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology have dramatically increased data collection, storage, and manipulation ability. As data sets have grown in size and complexity, direct &quot;hands-on&quot; data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect, automated data processing, aided by other discoveries in computer science, specially in the field of machine learning, such as neural networks, cluster analysis, genetic algorithms (1950s), decision trees and decision rules (1960s), and support vector machines (1990s). Data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns. in large data sets. It bridges the gap from applied statistics and artificial intelligence (which usually provide the mathematical background) to database management by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently, allowing such methods to be applied to ever-larger data sets.

==Process==
The &quot;knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process&quot; is commonly defined with the stages:

# Selection
# Pre-processing
# Transformation
# &quot;Data mining&quot;
# Interpretation/evaluation.

It exists, however, in many variations on this theme, such as the Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) which defines six phases:

# Business understanding
# Data understanding
# Data preparation
# Modeling
# Evaluation
# Deployment

or a simplified process such as (1) Pre-processing, (2) Data Mining, and (3) Results Validation.

Polls conducted in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2014 show that the CRISP-DM methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners.

The only other data mining standard named in these polls was SEMMA. However, 3–4 times as many people reported using CRISP-DM. Several teams of researchers have published reviews of data mining process models, and Azevedo and Santos conducted a comparison of CRISP-DM and SEMMA in 2008.

===Pre-processing===
Before data mining algorithms can be used, a target data set must be assembled. As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data, the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit. A common source for data is a data mart or data warehouse. Pre-processing is essential to analyze the multivariate data sets before data mining. The target set is then cleaned. Data cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing data.

===Data mining===
Data mining involves six common classes of tasks:

* Anomaly detection (outlier/change/deviation detection) – The identification of unusual data records, that might be interesting or data errors that require further investigation due to being out of standard range.
* Association rule learning (dependency modeling) – Searches for relationships between variables. For example, a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits. Using association rule learning, the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes. This is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis.
* Clustering – is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another &quot;similar&quot;, without using known structures in the data.
* Classification – is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data. For example, an e-mail program might attempt to classify an e-mail as &quot;legitimate&quot; or as &quot;spam&quot;.
* Regression – attempts to find a function that models the data with the least error that is, for estimating the relationships among data or datasets.
* Summarization – providing a more compact representation of the data set, including visualization and report generation.

===Results validation===
Data mining can unintentionally be misused, producing results that appear to be significant but which do not actually predict future behavior and cannot be reproduced on a new sample of data, therefore bearing little use. This is sometimes caused by investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper statistical hypothesis testing. A simple version of this problem in machine learning is known as overfitting, but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a train/test split—when applicable at all—may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening.

The final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set. Not all patterns found by the algorithms are necessarily valid. It is common for data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set. This is called overfitting. To overcome this, the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained. The learned patterns are applied to this test set, and the resulting output is compared to the desired output. For example, a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish &quot;spam&quot; from &quot;legitimate&quot; e-mails would be trained on a training set of sample e-mails. Once trained, the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of e-mails on which it had &quot;not&quot; been trained. The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e-mails they correctly classify. Several statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm, such as ROC curves.

If the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards, it is necessary to re-evaluate and change the pre-processing and data mining steps. If the learned patterns do meet the desired standards, then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge.

==Research==
The premier professional body in the field is the Association for Computing Machinery&#x27;s (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (SIGKDD). Since 1989, this ACM SIG has hosted an annual international conference and published its proceedings, and since 1999 it has published a biannual academic journal titled &quot;SIGKDD Explorations&quot;.

Computer science conferences on data mining include:

* CIKM Conference – ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management
* European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases
* KDD Conference – ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining

Data mining topics are also present in many data management/database conferences such as the ICDE Conference, SIGMOD Conference and International Conference on Very Large Data Bases.

==Standards==
There have been some efforts to define standards for the data mining process, for example, the 1999 European Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM 1.0) and the 2004 Java Data Mining standard (JDM 1.0). Development on successors to these processes (CRISP-DM 2.0 and JDM 2.0) was active in 2006 but has stalled since. JDM 2.0 was withdrawn without reaching a final draft.

For exchanging the extracted models—in particular for use in predictive analytics—the key standard is the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML), which is an XML-based language developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG) and supported as exchange format by many data mining applications. As the name suggests, it only covers prediction models, a particular data mining task of high importance to business applications. However, extensions to cover (for example) subspace clustering have been proposed independently of the DMG.

==Notable uses==

Data mining is used wherever there is digital data available. Notable examples of data mining can be found throughout business, medicine, science, finance, construction, and surveillance.

==Privacy concerns and ethics==
While the term &quot;data mining&quot; itself may have no ethical implications, it is often associated with the mining of information in relation to user behavior (ethical and otherwise).

The ways in which data mining can be used can in some cases and contexts raise questions regarding privacy, legality, and ethics. In particular, data mining government or commercial data sets for national security or law enforcement purposes, such as in the Total Information Awareness Program or in ADVISE, has raised privacy concerns.

Data mining requires data preparation which uncovers information or patterns which compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations. A common way for this to occur is through data aggregation. Data aggregation involves combining data together (possibly from various sources) in a way that facilitates analysis (but that also might make identification of private, individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent). This is not data mining &quot;per se&quot;, but a result of the preparation of data before—and for the purposes of—the analysis. The threat to an individual&#x27;s privacy comes into play when the data, once compiled, cause the data miner, or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set, to be able to identify specific individuals, especially when the data were originally anonymous.

It is recommended to be aware of the following before data are collected:
* The purpose of the data collection and any (known) data mining projects.
* How the data will be used.
* Who will be able to mine the data and use the data and their derivatives.
* The status of security surrounding access to the data.
* How collected data can be updated.

Data may also be modified so as to &quot;become&quot; anonymous, so that individuals may not readily be identified. However, even &quot;anonymized&quot; data sets can potentially contain enough information to allow identification of individuals, as occurred when journalists were able to find several individuals based on a set of search histories that were inadvertently released by AOL.

The inadvertent revelation of personally identifiable information leading to the provider violates Fair Information Practices. This indiscretion can cause financial,
emotional, or bodily harm to the indicated individual. In one instance of privacy violation, the patrons of Walgreens filed a lawsuit against the company in 2011 for selling
prescription information to data mining companies who in turn provided the data
to pharmaceutical companies.

===Situation in Europe===

Europe has rather strong privacy laws, and efforts are underway to further strengthen the rights of the consumers. However, the U.S.–E.U. Safe Harbor Principles, developed between 1998 and 2000, currently effectively expose European users to privacy exploitation by U.S. companies. As a consequence of Edward Snowden&#x27;s global surveillance disclosure, there has been increased discussion to revoke this agreement, as in particular the data will be fully exposed to the National Security Agency, and attempts to reach an agreement with the United States have failed.

In the United Kingdom in particular there have been cases of corporations using data mining as a way to target certain groups of customers forcing them to pay unfairly high prices. These groups tend to be people of lower socio-economic status who are not savvy to the ways they can be exploited in digital market places.

===Situation in the United States===

In the United States, privacy concerns have been addressed by the US Congress via the passage of regulatory controls such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The HIPAA requires individuals to give their &quot;informed consent&quot; regarding information they provide and its intended present and future uses. According to an article in &quot;Biotech Business Week&quot;, &quot;&#x27;[i]n practice, HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena,&#x27; says the AAHC. More importantly, the rule&#x27;s goal of protection through informed consent is approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individuals.&quot; This underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices.

U.S. information privacy legislation such as HIPAA and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) applies only to the specific areas that each such law addresses. The use of data mining by the majority of businesses in the U.S. is not controlled by any legislation.

==Copyright law==

===Situation in Europe===

Under European copyright database laws, the mining of in-copyright works (such as by web mining) without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal. Where a database is pure data in Europe, it may be that there is no copyright—but database rights may exist, so data mining becomes subject to intellectual property owners&#x27; rights that are protected by the Database Directive. On the recommendation of the Hargreaves review, this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014 to allow content mining as a limitation and exception. The UK was the second country in the world to do so after Japan, which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining. However, due to the restriction of the Information Society Directive (2001), the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions.
Since 2020 also Switzerland has been regulating data mining by allowing it in the research field under certain conditions laid down by art. 24d of the Swiss Copyright Act. This new article entered into force on 1 April 2020.

The European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013, under the title of Licences for Europe. The focus on the solution to this legal issue, such as licensing rather than limitations and exceptions, led to representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.

===Situation in the United States===

US copyright law, and in particular its provision for fair use, upholds the legality of content mining in America, and other fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea. As content mining is transformative, that is it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the Google Book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google&#x27;s digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed—one being text and data mining.

<text>Buick () is a division of the American automobile manufacturer General Motors (GM). Started by automotive pioneer David Dunbar Buick in 1899, it was among the first American automobile brands and was the company that established General Motors in 1908. Before the establishment of General Motors, GM founder William C. Durant had served as Buick&#x27;s general manager and major investor. With the demise of Oldsmobile in 2004, Buick became the oldest surviving American carmaker. Buick is positioned as a premium automobile brand, selling luxury vehicles positioned below the flagship luxury Cadillac division.

==History==
===Early years===

Buick is one of the oldest automobile brands in the world and is currently the oldest in the United States still active today. Autocar, founded in 1897, is the oldest motor vehicle manufacturer in the western hemisphere; while originally an automobile maker, Autocar now builds heavy trucks. Oldsmobile, also an early automaker founded in 1897, is now defunct; Studebaker was founded in 1852, but did not begin producing automobiles until 1902; Henry Ford produced his first car in 1896 but did not start the Ford Motor Company until 1903, and during the period in between was involved with other automobile manufacturers such as Cadillac, founded in 1902.

The first two Buick automobiles were made in 1899 and 1900 at the &quot;Buick Auto-Vim and Power Company&quot; by chief engineer Walter Marr, but company owner David Dunbar Buick was reluctant to begin making automobiles, being satisfied with stationary and marine engine production, so Marr left Buick in 1901 to found his own automobile company under his own name. His replacement was Eugene Richard, who applied for a patent in 1902 for Marr&#x27;s valve-in-head (overhead valve) engine, which patent, number 771,095, was awarded to Richard in the name of Buick in 1904. In 1903, the third Buick automobile was made, this time by Richard, but in 1904 Buick, whose company was now called &quot;Buick Motor Company&quot;, moved from Detroit to Flint, Michigan, and Richard stayed behind. Marr was rehired in Flint as chief engineer, to begin making automobiles in production. That year, 37 Buick automobiles were made, production increasing to 750 in 1905, 1,400 in 1906, 4,641 in 1907, and 8,820 in 1908, taking the number one spot away from close competitors Ford, Maxwell and Olds Motor Works. Buick proclaimed themselves the largest car manufacturer in the world this year.

David Buick incorporated his company as the Buick Motor Company on May 19, 1903, in Detroit, Michigan. Buick had been financed by a friend and fellow automobile enthusiast, Benjamin Briscoe, who in September 1903 sold control of the business to James H. Whiting, of Flint Wagon Works, in Flint, Michigan. Whiting moved Buick to Flint, to a location across the street from his factory, with the idea of adding Buick&#x27;s engines to his wagons. David Buick stayed on as a manager and re-hired Walter Marr as chief engineer. The engine Buick and Marr developed for this automobile was a two-cylinder valve-in-head engine of 159 cubic inches, with each cylinder horizontal and opposed to the other by 180 degrees.

Whiting built only a few automobiles in 1904, the Model B, before running out of operating capital, causing him to bring in William C. Durant that year as a controlling investor. Durant built a few more model B&#x27;s in 1904, stepped up production for the model C in 1905, and spent the next four years turning Buick into the biggest-selling automobile brand in the US.

During the 19th century, Durant had made his fortune as co-owner, also in Flint, with Josiah Dallas Dort, of the Durant-Dort Carriage Company, which by 1904 was the largest carriage-making company in the country and one of the largest in the world. Durant moved most Buick production to the former Durant-Dort Imperial Wheel plant in Jackson, Michigan in 1905. Buick continued car production in Jackson through 1907, when Factory #1 was completed in Flint. The Jackson plant continued production with Buick trucks through 1912. David Buick sold his stock upon departure in 1906, making him a wealthy man, but he died in modest circumstances 25 years later. In 1907, Durant agreed to supply motors to R. S. McLaughlin in Canada, an automaker, and in 1908 he founded General Motors.

Between 1899 and 1902, two prototype vehicles were built in Detroit, Michigan by Walter Lorenzo Marr. Some documentation exists of the 1901 or 1902 prototype with tiller steering similar to the Oldsmobile Curved Dash.
In mid-1904, another prototype was constructed for an endurance run, which convinced Whiting to authorize the production of the first models offered to the public. The architecture of this prototype was the basis for the Model B.

The first Buick made for sale, the 1904 horizontally opposed 2-cylinder engine Model B, was built in Flint, Michigan at a re-purposed factory that was known as the Flint Wagon Works. There were 37 Buicks made that year, none of which survive. There are, however, two replicas in existence: the 1904 endurance car, at the Buick Gallery &amp; Research Center in Flint, and a Model B assembled by an enthusiast in California for the division&#x27;s 100th anniversary. Both of these vehicles use various parts from Buicks of that early era, as well as fabricated parts. These vehicles were each constructed with the two known surviving 1904 engines.
The early success of Buick is attributed mainly to what it called the valve-in-head engine, now known as the overhead valve (OHV), engine patented by Eugene Richard and developed by Richard, Buick, and Marr. The Model F had a two-cylinder engine, an 87-inch wheelbase, and weighed 1,800 lbs. The creation of General Motors is attributed mainly to the success of Buick, so it can be said Marr and Richard&#x27;s designs directly led to GM. The power train and chassis architecture introduced on the Model B was continued through the 1909 Model F.

The Model F was similar to the Model G, a lower-priced two-seat roadster, produced from 1906 until 1909. Both the F and G were powered by a two-cylinder 159 engine producing along with a 2-speed transmission as well as mechanical brakes on the rear wheels.

The flat-twin engine is inherently balanced, with torque presented to the chassis in a longitudinal manner. The engine was mounted amidships.

Billy Durant was a promoter, and Buick soon became the largest carmaker in America. Durant embarked on a series of corporate acquisitions, calling the new firm General Motors. At first, the manufacturers comprising General Motors competed against each other, but Durant ended that. He wanted each General Motors division to target one class of buyers. Buick was positioned below the Cadillac brand. To save on resources, Buick vehicles shared a common platform, called the GM A platform, that was shared with Chevrolet, Oakland, Oldsmobile, and Cadillac.

At first, Buick followed the likes of Napier in automobile racing, winning the first-ever race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

The first full-size Buick to join the smaller Model B was in 1907, when the Buick Model D was introduced with a four-cylinder T-head engine, installed in the front with rear-wheel drive. This was one of the only cars with side valves that Buick ever made.

====1910s - 1920s====
In 1910, Buick introduced the Model 10 with an OHV four-cylinder engine followed in 1911, with their first closed-body car, the Buick Six, that followed the same bodystyle that first appeared at Cadillac, and four years ahead of Ford. The car was built at the all-new factory in Flint which later became known as Buick City. Buick during the 1920s made various sized vehicles, with series designations for different years, sometimes using numbers, while later years using lettered designations. One of the larger vehicles, with a straight-six, was the Buick Master Six. The Model 10 was phased out during a restructuring initiated by GM&#x27;s new leadership that assumed position on November 15, 1910.

In the 1910s and 1920s, Buick was a prestige brand in the Republic of China with the brand driven by or for high-level politicians and the Emperor. The latter imported two Buick cars in 1924, making it the first automobile to enter China. By 1930, Buick claimed one-sixth of the total number of cars in the country. Buick now sells 80% of its production in the People&#x27;s Republic of China and is a minor player in Taiwan.

In 1929, as part of General Motors&#x27; companion make program, Buick Motor Division launched the Marquette sister brand, designed to bridge the price gap between Buick and Oldsmobile. Its styling featured a high peaked hood and radiator shell while its suspension used four, parallel, semi-elliptical springs with Delco-Lovejoy shock absorbers. Marquette was discontinued in 1930. All Buick, Marquette, Viking, and Oldsmobile products shared the newly introduced GM B platform starting in 1926.

====1930s====
Buick debuted two major achievements for the 1931 model year, the OHV Buick Straight-8 engine and a synchromesh transmission in all models but the Series 50. The Eight was offered in three displacements, the 220 cubic inch (bore 2 7/8 in. stroke 4.25 in.), was available in the Series 50 with 77 brake HP. The Series 60 engine was a 272 cu. in. unit (bore 3 1/16 in., stroke 5 in.) giving 90 brake HP. Cadillac had previously introduced the Cadillac Type 51 with a flathead V8 engine in 1915 which made usage of an eight-cylinder engine a luxury feature.

The Series 80 and Series 90 used a 344 cu. in. version (bore 3 5/16 in., stroke 5 in.) for 104 brake HP. Automatic vacuum-operated spark advance was another feature replacing the steering column-mounted spark lever although an emergency lever was now dash mounted. Buick scored another first in 1939 when it became the first company to introduce turn signals, which did not appear on other car brands until almost a decade later. All 1939 models also had a steering column-mounted shift lever.

In the mid-1930s McLaughlin-Buicks were purchased by British monarch Edward VIII. He had a preference for the Canadian built McLaughlin-Buick. Buicks were used for royal transport within Canada, including for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth during the 1939 royal tour of Canada.

In the 1920s and 1930s Cadillac and Buick vehicles were popular with long-distance passenger service operators e.g. the Nairn Transport Company in the Middle East (Baghdad-Damascus).

===Post World War II years===
====1940s====
1940 saw the first use of the &quot;Estate&quot; designation for Buick on the Super station wagon. World War II stopped automobile production in 1942. Starting that year, Buick produced the M18 Hellcat tank destroyer and supplied radial engines for the B-24 Liberator, Douglas C-47 Skytrain, and Douglas C-54 Skymaster. By the fall of 1945, automobile production resumed. In 1948, the Dynaflow automatic transmission was first offered by Buick. 1949 saw the debut of Buick&#x27;s VentiPorts.

====1950s====
1953 marked Buick&#x27;s 50th anniversary as well as the introductions of the Buick V8 engine and the Roadmaster Skylark. In 1955, Buick had its best model year sales to date with 738,814 vehicles sold; a record that would hold until 1977. In 1957, Buick&#x27;s new 364 cu. in. engine block and ball joint front suspension debuted and Roadmasters now had aluminum finned brake drums. 1959 saw the introduction of three new models: Electra, Invicta and LeSabre as well as a new 401 cu. in. V8 engine in the Electra and Invicta. An Electra also paced the Indianapolis 500 race that year.

====1960s====
An Electra 225 paced the Daytona 500 race in both 1960 and 1963. In 1961, a new Fireball V6 engine was introduced and the Skylark nameplate returned as the top model of the new Special compact car line. The Buick Special was named Motor Trend Car of the Year in 1962. Also in 1962, Wildcat was introduced as a trim level on Invicta and became its own model the following year. In 1963 the Riviera was introduced as its own model. In the mid-1960s Buick started officially selling German-built Opel cars through its North American dealerships. For 1967, radial tires became available as an option on all full-size Buicks.

====1970s====
The 1970s saw a number of new models added to the Buick lineup including the Estate Wagon as its own model in 1970, Centurion in 1971, Apollo in 1973, and Skyhawk in 1975. 1975 also saw the first appearance of the &quot;Park Avenue&quot; nameplate for Buick as a trim/option package on the Electra 225 Limited. A Buick Century paced the Indianapolis 500 race not once but twice in the mid-1970s. In 1976, Buick began selling rebadged Isuzu Geminis as Opels to replace the Opel Kadett models it had previously marketed. The following year, Electra 225 and LeSabre were redesigned and downsized, and the Buick brand saw its best model year sales to date with 773,313 vehicles sold. 1978 marked Buick&#x27;s 75th anniversary and welcomed a redesigned Century as well as a redesigned Regal coupe which was now available with a turbocharged V6 engine. Buick model year sales broke another record in 1978 with 795,316 vehicles sold. In 1979, the Riviera was redesigned; Riviera S-Type was named Motor Trend Car of the Year.

====1980s====
In the 1980s, Buick&#x27;s lineup saw several changes including the downsizing of various models. In 1980, Lloyd Reuss was appointed as general manager and further pushed Buick into turbocharging, racing, and performance production cars, building momentum which continued a number of years after his departure in 1984 as he headed toward a brief term as GM president. Also in 1980, the Diesel engine became available on select Buick models and Somerset was introduced as an optional package on the Regal Limited. In 1981, the T-Type performance trim was introduced on the Riviera. Regal was the official pace car of the Indianapolis 500 race in 1981. In 1982, the Grand National high-performance package was first offered on Regal. A soft-top Riviera helped lead the return of the convertible, which had disappeared from domestic lineups in 1976. The following year, a Riviera convertible with a twin-turbo V6 paced the Indy 500. Also in 1983, Buick had its best model year to date with 810,435 vehicles sold.

In 1984, Buick was the official car of the XXIII Olympiad. A reorganization split manufacturing &amp; engineering from sales and marketing. The first pilot Buick is produced at &quot;Buick City&quot;, a state-of-the-art assembly center built inside the walls of Buick&#x27;s home plant in Flint. Buick had its best model year sales to date with 906,626 vehicles sold plus Buick&#x27;s worldwide sales topped one million for the first time. Lloyd Reuss ended his tenure as general manager of the Buick Motor Division in 1984.

For the 1985 model year, Buick introduced the downsized sixth-generation Electra, effectively GM&#x27;s first front-drive, transverse-engine, full-size unibody cars — initially powered by a carbureted 3.0 liter Buick V6 engine, a fuel-injected 3.8 liter Buick V6 engine, or a 4.3 liter Oldsmobile diesel V6 engine. Each was mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission with a 0.70:1 overdrive gear. The 3.0 liter V6 and 4.3-liter diesel V6 were discontinued after 1985. During the 1985 through 1989 model years, the Electra name also continued to be used on the rear-wheel-drive B-body &quot;Estate&quot; station wagon. Also in 1985, Buick introduced the Somerset as its own model. Buick-powered cars won the pole and second position in qualifying for Indianapolis 500. Over the next few years, Buick engines would set a number of stock-block records and twice would power a third or more of the 33-car Indy 500 field (11 in 1990 and 12 in 1992). 1985 would be the final year for the rear-drive LeSabre before another downsizing and conversion to front-wheel-drive for 1986 (sedans and coupes only; the rear-drive LeSabre Estate Wagon would soldier on largely unchanged for a few more years). The top-line LeSabre Limited became the LeSabre Limited Collectors Edition to mark the end of an era for the rear-wheel-drive coupe and sedan; engine offerings included the standard 231 V6 (sedans and coupes) or optional Olds 307 V8 or Oldsmobile 350 diesel V8. 1985 saw Buick&#x27;s best model year sales to date with 915,336 vehicles sold.

In 1986, the LeSabre was introduced on the new front wheel drive H platform, after departing from rear wheel drive on the GM B platform. Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the Oldsmobile Delta 88. Like the previously introduced Electra, the LeSabre&#x27;s hood was hinged at the front of the car instead of near the cowl and windshield. Styling and did not include Buick&#x27;s long-standing ventiports or sweepspear styling cues. In 1986, a LeSabre Grand National model was built to qualify the coupe body style for NASCAR competition. Less than 120 units were made, all finished in black with a gray interior.

Also for 1986, the E-body Riviera was converted to unibody construction and further downsized to a wheelbase similar in length to that of the Buick Regal. The V6 was now the only engine, rated initially at SAE and of torque. It used the Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4 automatic with a 2.84:1 final drive ratio. This generation was noted for advanced electronic instrumentation displayed on a dash-mounted CRT. The CRT controlled the vehicle&#x27;s climate control system and stereo, and also supplied advanced instrumentation such as a trip computer and maintenance reminder feature. Four-wheel disc brakes were standard. With a choice of three suspension packages available, up to the performance oriented FE3 setting, handling was notably improved. The Riviera placed fourth for &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s 1986 Car of the Year contest. Fuel economy was notably improved for the 1986 Riviera, but the investment in the downsized, transverse engine front-wheel drive platform resulted in a substantial price increase to $19,831 for the base model to $21,577 for the new T-Type. Downsizing also resulted in a dimensional similarity to smaller, less expensive offerings from GM. The smaller dimensions, generic styling, and lack of a V8 led to Riviera sales plummeting to 22,138 for 1986.

In 1987, the last of the turbo/intercooled Regal Grand Nationals, often called the quickest American cars, were offered as well as 547 even quicker special edition &#x27;87 GNXs. It would also be the last year for the rear-wheel-drive Regal. General manager Ed Mertz promoted the new &quot;Premium American Motorcars&quot; theme which focused Buick marketing on the various qualities that made the marque famous.

In 1988, Buick was the official car of the U.S. Olympic Team. The Reatta two-seater was introduced, to be followed two years later by a convertible. Also in 1988, Regal was downsized and converted to front-wheel drive. Bobby Allison won the Daytona 500 in a Regal that year. 1988 also saw the debut of the slogan &quot;The Great American Road Belongs to Buick&quot;.

In 1989, a new Electra trim level was offered called the Park Avenue Ultra. The Ultra was an upgrade to the Electra Park Avenue and featured a standard leather-trimmed interior with dual 20-way power front seats (shared with Cadillac&#x27;s restyled 1989 Fleetwood Sixty Special), lower-body accent exterior paint treatment, distinctive thick-padded vinyl top with limousine-style rear-window surround (available only on Ultra), simulated burled elm trim on the doors and instrument panel, unique aluminum wheels, anti-lock brakes, chromed B-pillar moldings, specific grille and tail lamps, leather-wrapped steering wheel, electronic instrumentation, padded glove-compartment door, unique interior door panel trim, and a variety of otherwise minor changes. With its long list of standard equipment, the Park Avenue Ultra carried a higher base price than Cadillac&#x27;s Sedan de Ville. The Riviera was also restyled for 1989, adding 11 inches to its overall length. In the late 1980s, the Flint-built LeSabre ranked #1 in North America and #2 in the world in a major independent quality study which eventually led Buick to change its ad slogan from &quot;The Great American Road Belongs to Buick&quot; to &quot;Buick: The New Symbol for Quality in America.&quot;

====1990s====
In 1990, the first Reatta convertible was produced. 1990 was also the last year for the Electra as Park Avenue, previously a trim level on the Electra, became its own model for the 1991 model year. In 1991, Buick led the industry in improvement in sales and market share. A new four-door Regal came to market for 1991, the first Regal sedan since 1984. Buick also introduced a supercharged 3.8-liter V6 in the Park Avenue Ultra. Supercharging became so popular at Buick that by the new millennium, Buick was the leading marketer and industry leader of supercharged cars. 1991 saw the return of the Roadmaster after a 33-year absence. The Roadmaster was first offered as a wagon only and then a sedan was added for 1992.

For 1992, the popular LeSabre was redesigned along the same lines as the previous year&#x27;s Park Avenue. 1992 also saw the introduction of a new, redesigned Skylark. In 1993, a special edition LeSabre was sold to commemorate Buick&#x27;s 90th anniversary. In addition to Custom trim level standard equipment, included were &quot;90th Anniversary&quot; badging, cassette player, cruise control, rear-window defogger, power driver&#x27;s seat, carpeted floor mats, exterior pinstripes, and choice of wire or aluminum wheel covers.

In 1995, after a hiatus in 1994, the Riviera returned with radical styling that departed from the previous generations&#x27; more traditional image. A naturally aspirated 3800 V6 was standard, with a supercharged version rated at and available as an option. Rivieras were now assembled in Lake Orion, Michigan, riding the same Cadillac-derived G platform as the 4-door Oldsmobile Aurora.

In 1996, both the Roadmaster sedan and wagon were discontinued. In 1998, after 95 years in Flint, Buick&#x27;s headquarters was moved to Detroit. Bob Coletta, Buick general manager, saw the first Chinese Buick roll off the line at Shanghai before he turned over the top Buick job to Roger Adams. Buick Gallery and Research Center opened at Flint&#x27;s Sloan Museum. A reorganization of the division split sales from marketing.

In 1999, the last of nearly 16 million Buicks were built in Flint&#x27;s Buick City. The last car, a 1999 LeSabre, rolled off the assembly line on June 29 that year. In a major independent quality study, Buick ranked #2 (and top domestic) among 37 international brands and Buick City shared the top world position among automotive assembly plants. With sales of all coupes declining in the North American market, GM decided to discontinue the Riviera. 1999 was the car&#x27;s last model year with production ceasing on November 25, 1998. The final 200 cars had special silver paint and trim and were denoted &quot;Silver Arrow&quot; models, a designation which hearkened back to several Silver Arrow show cars that had been built off Riviera bodies by Bill Mitchell. The eighth generation Rivieras received the most powerful V6 Buick engine since the Grand Nationals of the 1980s. The supercharged OHV V6 gave impressive torque and acceleration, pushing the car from 0 to in under 7 seconds, and turning the mile in 15.5 seconds and achieved MPG fuel efficiency ratings of 18 city/27 highway.

===Recent years===
====2000s====
In the 2000s, Buick&#x27;s lineup was modified with the compact and performance segments being abandoned in favor of the crossover/SUV market which was growing in popularity. In 2000, Buick headed into the new millennium with a redesigned LeSabre (best-selling U.S. full-size car for eight straight years) and a more powerful Century. Since the first Detroit experimental car of 1899–1900 and the first Flint production car of 1904, more than 35 million Buicks had been built. The 2000 LeSabre was introduced in March 1999 and was now built on GM&#x27;s G platform; however, GM chose to continue to refer to it as the H platform. The LeSabre was manufactured at GM&#x27;s Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly factory in Hamtramck, Michigan and Lake Orion Assembly, in Lake Orion, Michigan. Some of the changes with the redesign included a new grille that did not open with the hood and slightly smaller exterior dimensions. Despite its somewhat smaller exterior size, it still offered similar interior room and more trunk space than the previous model. 2001 saw Buick&#x27;s first entry into the crossover market with the introduction of the Rendezvous as a 2002 model. In 2003, the Buick Centieme crossover concept car commemorated Buick Motor Division&#x27;s 100th anniversary. Some of the Centieme&#x27;s exterior design and interior features would later appear on the 2008 Enclave crossover. In 2004, Buick added the Rainier mid-size SUV, and the new Terraza minivan was added a year later.

In the years following, Buick began consolidating its North American lineup and by 2008 had reduced it to just three models: the LaCrosse/Allure, the Lucerne, and the new-for-2008 Enclave. The Super name had also returned after a 50-year absence as a new performance trim level on LaCrosse and Lucerne. The brand&#x27;s total overall sales slipped in the United States, and, with a reputation for primarily appealing to older buyers, rumors circulated throughout this decade that the Buick marque would be discontinued. The profitability of the model lineup and popularity in China ensured Buick&#x27;s future within General Motors, with the decision being made to discontinue the Pontiac brand instead.

Since 2005, GM had gradually consolidated Buick with GMC and former Pontiac dealerships to create the current Buick-GMC network. During General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization and emergence in 2009, the company designated Buick as a &quot;core brand&quot;, citing the division&#x27;s success in China. Behind the scenes, GM began to move products originally planned for other brands to Buick. The Opel Insignia was originally intended to become the second-generation Saturn Aura, but instead became the new Buick Regal. In the 2009 J.D. Power and Associates Vehicle Dependability Study, Buick tied with Jaguar as the most dependable brand in the United States.

====2010s====
The 2010s included the return of a classic Buick nameplate, the Buick Regal, and several new model names. The decade also saw the brand&#x27;s first hatchback since 1987, its first factory convertible since 1991, and its first station wagon since 1996. Buick further expanded its presence in the popular crossover/SUV market in the 2010s.

In January 2009, Buick unveiled the new 2010 LaCrosse sedan, an all-new styling direction that included traditional Buick cues. The market responded positively to the LaCrosse and reviews favorably compared it to luxury models such as the Lexus ES. In 2010, Buick became the fastest-growing automotive brand in America and attracted a younger customer demographic. A GM company spokesman at the time said that Buick was positioned as a &quot;premium&quot; marque (entry-level luxury) to compete with various Acura, Infiniti, Lexus, and Volvo models, while Cadillac was aimed at the &quot;luxury&quot; performance segment which includes brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz. An all-new Regal sedan, a smaller model based on the European Opel Insignia, was re-introduced for the 2011 model year after a seven-year absence. For 2012, the all-new Verano, which was a compact sedan based on the Chevrolet Cruze, joined the lineup. Additionally, the performance-oriented Regal GS officially went on sale and became the first Buick in almost 20 years to be offered with a manual transmission and a turbocharger. Buick also entered the hybrid market with the introduction of eAssist technology on the 2012 LaCrosse and Regal which helped improve fuel economy ratings by as much as 38% over the regular gas-engine versions. Meanwhile, sales of the Enclave crossover remained strong. In January 2012, the all-new Encore mini crossover was unveiled at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Also in 2012, a turbocharged version of the Verano was introduced and the Enclave was redesigned for the 2013 model year. In 2013, GM confirmed plans for a &quot;hybrid global brand&quot; which includes Opel/Vauxhall and Buick using more synergies between the brands. LaCrosse and Regal were refreshed for the 2014 model year. In 2015, the all-new Cascada subcompact convertible debuted at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The all-new 2017 LaCrosse was shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November. Buick also confirmed that the Envision compact crossover would be sold in North America starting summer 2016. The Verano compact sedan was dropped from the Buick lineup in North America in 2017. With GM selling off the Opel/Vauxhall division to Group PSA in March 2017, Buick is expected to move away from sharing the Opel model/designs upon the completion of the current generation vehicles.

For 2018, Buick replaced the Regal sedan with an all-new model offering hatchback and station wagon body styles. This new Regal was the first hatchback from Buick for the North American market since the 1987 Skyhawk and the first station wagon since the 1996 Roadmaster. A sub-brand was also added in 2018 to accompany Buick, with the Avenir badge being applied to its top-of-the-line level trims, utilizing the same strategy as GMC&#x27;s successful Denali sub-brand. 2019 would be the last year for the Cascada convertible globally and the LaCrosse sedan for the North American market.

====2020s====

New for 2020 was the Encore GX crossover which slotted in between the existing Encore and Envision. The Regal hatchback and station wagon were discontinued for the North American market in 2020.

In June 2022, Buick Global Chief Duncan Aldred announced that Buick would transition its entire line-up to electric vehicles by 2030. As part of that plan, all Buick dealers would be given the opportunity to take a buyout rather than switch to all-electric. Aldred explained the move saying that making the transition to electric would require a considerable investment in upgrading dealer facilities and not all dealers would be willing to make the financial commitment. Aldrerd also pointed out that most Buick dealers also sold other GM products, so accepting the buyout would not necessarily result in a dealership closing. Once Buick&#x27;s top-selling model in North America, the Encore was discontinued in 2022 as more customers favored the larger Encore GX which was introduced for 2020 and became Buick&#x27;s new top seller. In 2023, the Envista launched for the 2024 model year.

 Buick&#x27;s North American lineup consists of the Envista and Encore GX subcompact crossovers, the Envision compact crossover, and the Enclave mid-size crossover.

==Concept cars==

Buick has a long history of creating intriguing concept cars dating back to the Y-Job, the industry&#x27;s first concept car, of 1938. Its recent concepts, all electric vehicles, are the Buick Enspire concept unveiled in April 2018, the Buick Electra concept unveiled in September 2020, and the Buick Wildcat concept which was unveiled in June 2022.

==Distinguishing features==

===Trishield===
The Buick Trishield is rooted in the ancestral coat of arms of the automaker&#x27;s founder, David Dunbar Buick. That crest was a red shield with a checkered silver and azure diagonal line from the upper left to lower right, a stag above, and a punctured cross below. The division adopted this on its radiator grilles in 1937. In 1960, the logo underwent a major overhaul. Its single shield was replaced by a trio in red, white, and blue—denoting the LeSabre, Invicta, and Electra then in the Buick lineup. It was supplanted by the Buick Hawk in the 1970s, but reemerged in simplified form in the 1980s. The Trishield became monochromatic in 2005, but the traditional colors returned in 2023.

===VentiPorts===
A traditional Buick styling cue dating to 1949 is a series of three or four vents on the front fender behind the front wheels. The source of this design feature was a custom car of Buick stylist Ned Nickles, which in addition had a flashing light within each hole each synchronized with a specific spark plug simulating the flames from the exhaust stack of a fighter airplane. The flashing light feature was not used by Buick in production.

They were called VentiPorts because, as the 1949 sales brochure noted, they helped ventilate the engine compartment. Air entered from the grille into the engine bay, was pressurized by the radiator fan, and exited through the VentiPorts. Later in the model year, however, they were made non-functional and from then on were solely a styling feature.

When introduced, the number of VentiPorts (three or four) denoted the size of straight-eight engine installed. Since displacement differences in straight-eight engines resulted in more significant differences in engine length than on V8s, the Roadmaster needed a longer chassis in front of the cowl to accommodate its larger engine. Thus, an extra VentiPort corresponded to that additional length. After the more compact V8 replaced the straight-eight engine in 1953 this difference in chassis length was no longer needed, but the convention remained. Consequently, when the Century, which shared the Special&#x27;s smaller body, was reintroduced in 1954, it also received four VentiPorts to denote its engine&#x27;s greater displacement. However, in 1955, the Super, which shared the Roadmaster&#x27;s larger body, was promoted from three to four VentiPorts despite having the smaller displacement engine. The Invicta, which took the place of the Century in 1959 and had the smaller body with the larger displacement engine, had only three VentiPorts on introduction; thus the number of VentiPorts came to denote body size rather than engine size.

In 1961, Buick introduced the first V6 engine installed in an American passenger car, in the Buick Special, and three VentiPorts appeared on the side, now denoting the number of cylinders instead of displacement or body size. VentiPorts would continue to appear on some Buick models through 1981.

In 2003 VentiPorts were re-introduced on the Buick Park Avenue Ultra, and continued with its replacement, the Lucerne. Consistent with the tradition that held from 1961, the Lucerne&#x27;s VentiPorts refer directly to the number of pistons: V6 models have three on each side, while V8s have four on each side.

===Sweepspear===
Another styling cue from the 1940s through the 1970s was the Sweepspear, a curved trim line running almost the length of the car. Introduced as an option on the 1949 Buick Roadmaster Riviera hardtop coupe, the original Sweepspear was a chrome-plated steel rub strip which began level over the front wheel, gently curved down across the front fender and door, dove nearly to the rocker panel just ahead of the rear wheel, then flared up and over the rear wheel before leveling off again into a straight run back to the tail light.

In 1942 all GM vehicles had an appearance upgrade where the trailing edge of the front fender was extended across the front doors that was called &quot;Airfoil&quot; accented by parallel chrome strips on the front and rear fenders on Buick vehicles. In later years the character line of the &quot;Airfoil&quot; feature was accented with a stainless steel strip that evolved into the Buick &quot;Sweepspear&quot; for several decades.

The &quot;Riviera trim&quot;, as it was initially called, was made available on the Roadmaster convertible very late in the &#x27;49 model year. It proved so popular that by the 1951 model year, it was made a standard feature on all Buicks. On 1950s models with two-tone paint, the Sweepspear separated the two colors.

Originally stainless steel, the Sweepspear eventually became a vinyl rub strip or simple character line in the sheetmetal, as hinted in some versions of the Buick Riviera, distinct on the 1968–1969 Skylark, and appearing on the 2008 Invicta concept car. Often optional trim was available to reinforce a plain character line in the bodywork.

====Delta fin====
The 1958 Buick was marketed beginning in September 1957, just as the space age began with the launching of Sputnik I on October 4 of that year. The &quot;Sweepspear&quot; evolved into the &quot;Delta Fin&quot; reminiscent of a rocket ship, which appeared on the all-new appearance for 1959, and was trimmed down in 1960 and removed for 1961.

===Taillight shapes===
During the 1950s, the characteristic form of the Buick taillamps was a tier of small, circular bullet-shapes. In the early 1960s, most models began to evolve a wide, rectangular pattern, until the 1965 Skylark and Electra models appeared with full-width rear lamps.

===Classic grille styling===

The Buick styling cue (dating from the 1942–1958 period) that has most often reappeared, though, is for the grille to be a horizontal oval with many, thin, vertical chromed ribs bulging forward. This has sometimes been called the Buick &quot;dollar grin&quot;, particularly on the early 1950s models, which had thick, highly polished ribs that somewhat resembled teeth. The 1950 model took this tooth theme to its extreme as the teeth crossed over the bumper exposing the 1950 &quot;grin&quot;, which was the result of extending the bumper guards over the front bumper, and was advertised as &quot;Front and Center with Duty plus Beauty&quot;. The 1951 model reined in the theme, bringing the bumper guard &quot;teeth&quot; back behind the bumper.

===Waterfall grille===

In recent years, Buick has adopted a waterfall grille, as seen on the Buick Velite concept car from 2004 and first used in production with the Buick Lucerne introduced for the 2006 model year. This waterfall grille bears some resemblance to grilles of Buicks from the 1980s, such as the Grand National.

===Nailhead===
The Buick V8 engine, nicknamed the Nailhead because of its relatively small intake and exhaust valves which resembled nails, became popular with hot-rodders in the 1950s and 1960s because the vertical attachment of the valve covers, in contrast to the angled attachment of other V8 engines, enabled the engine to fit into smaller spaces while maintaining easy access for maintenance.
==Performance==
In addition to premium and luxury vehicles, Buick has also been well known for its offerings of high-performance cars. Some of the better-known examples included the Gran Sport and Skylark GSX models of the 1960s and 1970s, and the Grand National and GNX models of the 1980s, with a performance package revival called T-Type.

==World distribution==
===Asia===

Buick is one of China&#x27;s most popular, best-selling automobiles. In 2016, General Motors sold over 1.1 million Buicks in China. Buicks have always been popular in China. In pre-World War II China, one in five cars was a Buick. Buicks were used by the last emperor Puyi, the first president Sun Yat-sen, and the first premier Zhou Enlai.

Since 1999, a Buick Regal for China has been produced and sold by Shanghai GM and has proven to be popular among upscale, professional families, establishing Buick as one of the most popular vehicle brands in China. In addition, Buick of China sells a compact Excelle, similar to a five-door hatchback version called the HRV, and a minivan named the GL8. Many Buicks for the local market are equipped with smaller more fuel-efficient engines with double overhead camshafts, than those with overhead valves in the same nameplate for the American market.

GM Taiwan was founded in August 1989. In the early 1990s, Buick, along with other GM brands, was very popular and frequently seen on Taiwanese streets. Park Avenue, 3rd and 4th generation Regal, and 6th generation Skylark used to be sold in Taiwan. In December 2004, General Motors signed a memorandum of understanding with Yulon, a firm based in Taiwan, for the licensed manufacture of Buick vehicles there. In July 2005, Yulon GM Motor Co. Ltd. (Yulon GM), a joint venture with 51 percent equity stake held by Yulon Motor and 49 percent by GM, was founded.

In April 2010, Buick debuted a localised version of LaCrosse, named Alpheon, to the South Korean market.

===Mexico===
Buicks were sold in Mexico from 1921 until 1962, when a protectionist policy on behalf of the government restricted the percentage of imported parts that could be used in the manufacture of vehicles and the sale of imported cars. From then onwards, all GM products were sold by Chevrolet dealerships. In 1990, after a heavy modification to the protectionist policy of the sixties, GM started assembling the Buick Century in Mexico, at the plant in Ramos Arizpe, in the state of Coahuila, just south of Texas, and selling it through Mexican Chevrolet dealerships, so it was not uncommon for many people to call it &quot;Chevrolet Century&quot;. In 1997, GM stopped selling Buicks in Mexico and the brand was not sold there until 2009.

With the announcement in 2009 of the elimination of the Pontiac brand, it was speculated that Buicks would be sold once again in Mexico since there was a large network of Pontiac-GMC dealerships already in place. On July 24, 2009, Grace Lieblein, the new president of GM in Mexico, revealed that the Buick brand would be available in Mexico in late September of that year, after an absence of a dozen years, with the LaCrosse and the Enclave models. Buick shared the dealership floor with Pontiac and GMC until the Pontiac brand faded away in the summer of 2010.

On March 26, 2019, Buick announced that the Mexican division will offer only crossovers (Encore, Envision, and Enclave). The La Crosse sedan, Regal hatchback, and Regal TourX station wagon were dropped from the market as those brands were expected to be discontinued due to Opel&#x27;s future (under new owner Stellantis). The Insignia is tied to the North American-badged Regal and Buick&#x27;s decision to make the La Crosse exclusive to China.

===Middle East===
In Israel, Buicks are imported by Universal Motors, Ltd. (UMI), which also imports other GM vehicles. For model years 2004 and 2005, the Buick LeSabre and Buick Rendezvous were sold. For model years 2006 and 2007, the Buick LaCrosse and Buick Lucerne were sold alongside the Rendezvous. For the 2008 model year, the Buick LaCrosse and Buick Lucerne were available. Buicks were marketed throughout the Middle East until the second-generation Buick Roadmaster was discontinued, and continued to be available in the Gulf Cooperation Council markets until 1996.

===New Zealand===
Buicks were once sold in New Zealand. They were also built at the GMNZ plant in Petone, outside Wellington.

==Motorsport==
For many years, Buick was a substitute for Chevrolet in automobile racing. Driver Phil Shafer drove a Buick to win the 1933 Elgin Trophy, considered to be the first officially organized stock car race in the United States.

No earlier than the 1960s, Buick was a competitor in the Indianapolis 500, and (like almost every other American manufacturer) also participated in the Grand National stock car racing series using its Regal and later the Gran Sport.

The golden age of Buick in motorsport, however, was early through late 1980s. General Motors entered the Regal, particularly the Grand National model, in the NASCAR Cup Series alongside the Oldsmobile Cutlass. Buick was also a major powerplant in the IndyCar Series and IMSA GT Series (particularly in the IMSA GTP class) for several years. The 1990s, however, proved to be the end of Buick&#x27;s reign in motorsports, as GM replaced it for many years with Oldsmobile before phasing out that marque in 2004. Oldsmobile would be replaced by Pontiac until its demise in 2009, being replaced by Chevrolet.

Buicks were also entered in the Trans Am Series in the 1980s and 1990s using aftermarket V8 engines.

==Enthusiast organizations==
The Buick Club of America, founded in 1966, is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and restoration of automobiles built by the Buick Motor Division of General Motors Corporation.

<doc id="42256" wikidata="Q335946" url="?curid=42256" title="MIDI Maze">
<text>MIDI Maze, also known as Faceball 2000, is a networked first-person shooter maze video game for the Atari ST developed by Xanth Software F/X and released in 1987 by Hybrid Arts. The game takes place in a maze of untextured walls. The world animates smoothly as the player turns, much like the earlier &quot;Wayout&quot;, instead of only permitting 90 degree changes of direction. Using the MIDI ports on the Atari ST, the game is said to have introduced deathmatch combat to gaming in 1987. It also predated the LAN party concept by several years. The game found a wider audience when it was converted to &quot;Faceball 2000&quot; on the Game Boy.

==Gameplay==

Up to 16 computers can be networked in a &quot;MIDI Ring&quot; by daisy chaining MIDI ports that are built into the Atari ST series.

The game area occupies only roughly a quarter of the screen and consists of a first-person view of a flat-shaded maze with a crosshair in the middle. All players are shown as &quot;Pac-Man&quot;-like smiley avatars in various colors. Bullets are represented as small spheres.

The game is started by a designated master machine, which sets rules, divides players into teams, and selects a maze. A number of mazes come with the game, and additional mazes can be constructed using a text-editor.

==Development==
The original &quot;MIDI Maze&quot; team at Xanth Software F/X consisted of James Yee as the business manager, Michael Park as the graphic and networking programmer, and George Miller writing the AI and drone logic.

==Ports==
A Game Boy version was developed by Xanth, and published in 1991 by Bullet-Proof Software, with the title &quot;Faceball 2000&quot;. James Yee, owner of Xanth, had the idea of porting the 520ST application to the Game Boy. George Miller was hired to rewrite the AI-based drone logic, giving each drone a unique personality trait. This version allows two players with a Game Link Cable, or up to four players with the Four Player Adapter.

It is often rumored that the Game Boy version would allow up to 16 players by daisy-chaining Four Player Adapters, which is not the case. According to programmer Robert Champagne, the game does contain a 16-player mode; however, it requires a special connector that would be bundled with the game, to create a &quot;chain&quot; of Game Link Cables. As Nintendo did not allow them to do so, that connector was never released, so the 16-player mode cannot be enabled using Game Boy systems. However, a method exists for players to daisy chain Game Boy Advance link cables, where each purple end connects to the hub of another cable and the gray ends connecting to a Game Boy Advance, to allow up to 15 players.

A Super NES version, also titled &quot;Faceball 2000&quot;, was released in 1992, supporting two players in split-screen mode. This version features completely different graphics and levels from the earlier Game Boy version. A variety of in-game music for this version was composed by George &quot;The Fat Man&quot; Sanger.

A Game Gear version, also titled &quot;Faceball 2000&quot;, was released to the Japanese market by Riverhill Soft. It is a colorized version of the monochrome Game Boy version, supporting two players with two handheld consoles connected by the Gear-to-Gear Cable.

A PC-Engine CD-ROM version, titled only &quot;Faceball&quot; (フェイスボール), was released in Japan by Riverhill Soft.

===Unreleased ports===
A port of &quot;MIDI Maze&quot; for Atari 8-bit computers was developed by Xanth, but cancelled circa 1989. A prototype was eventually found and the ROM was released.

According to Robert Champagne, other unreleased ports were worked on at Xanth, including IBM PC and NES.

A port for Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Boy console, to be titled &quot;NikoChan Battle&quot; (ニコちゃんバトル) in Japan, was almost completed, but canceled as the system was discontinued in late 1995. A prototype was found in 2013, and the ROM was subsequently released.

==Reception==

In 1994, Sandy Petersen reviewed the game for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, giving it 2 out of 5 stars. Super Gamer magazine gave an overall review score of 82% writing: &quot;Ultra successful on the little Game Boy, this 3-D maze shoot-&#x27;em-up has been totally uprated for the SNES.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; picked &quot;Faceball 2000&quot; as the #5 greatest game available in 1991, saying: &quot;The Game Boy meets virtual reality (i.e., artificial, computer-enhanced, first-person perspective). In &quot;Faceball 2000&quot;, you assume the identity of a Holographically Assisted Physical Pattern Yielded for Active Computerized Embarkationor HAPPYFACEand hunt down your opponents. You can play alone or link up with as many as three additional players. More fun than real-life tag, and much more stimulating.&quot; CNET Gamecenter called &quot;MIDI Maze&quot; one of the 10 most innovative computer games of all time. In 2018, Den of Geek ranked the game 25th on their &quot;25 Underrated Game Boy Games.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Personal Computer World&quot; said that in 1987, &quot;MIDI Maze&quot; introduced the concept of deathmatch combat, using the built-in MIDI ports of the Atari ST for networking. TheGamer listed it as among ten games that revolutionized first-person shooters, which was also noted by Nostalgia Nerd and VG247. Ask.Audio marveled at how it used the Atari ST&#x27;s MIDI port for multiplayer gaming, also noted by Paleotronic. Nomad&#x27;s Reviews listed it as among the original first-person shooters, as did GamesRadar.

&quot;MIDI-Maze II&quot; was later developed by Markus Fritze for Sigma-Soft and released as shareware.

&quot;iMaze&quot; is an open source clone of the game for Unix-like systems.

<text>Hyundai Motor Company, often referred to as Hyundai Motors, ( ) and commonly known as Hyundai, (, ; ) is a South Korean multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, which was founded in 1967. Currently, the company owns 33.88 percent of Kia Corporation, and fully owns two marques including its luxury cars subsidiary, Genesis, and their electric vehicle brand Ioniq. The three brands altogether make up the Hyundai Motor Group.

Hyundai operates the second largest automobile manufacturing facility in Ulsan, South Korea which has an annual production capacity of 1.6 million units. The company employs approximately 75,000 people worldwide. Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through 5,000 dealerships and showrooms. As of November 2024, Hyundai is the world&#x27;s third-largest carmaker in terms of production, behind competitors Toyota and Volkswagen.

== History ==

Chung Ju-yung (1915–2001) founded the Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company in 1947. Hyundai Motor Company was later established in 1967, and the company&#x27;s first model, the Cortina, was released in cooperation with Ford Motor Company in 1968. When Hyundai wanted to develop their own car, they hired George Turnbull in February 1974, the former managing director of Austin Morris at British Leyland. He in turn hired five other top British car engineers. They were body designer Kenneth Barnett, engineers John Simpson and Edward Chapman, John Crosthwaite, formerly of BRM, as chassis engineer and Peter Slater as chief development engineer. In 1975, the Pony, the first South Korean car, was released, with styling by Giorgio Giugiaro of Italdesign and powertrain technology provided by Japan&#x27;s Mitsubishi Motors. Exports began in the following year to Ecuador and soon thereafter to the Benelux countries. Hyundai entered the British market in 1982, selling 2993 cars in their first year there.

In 1984, Hyundai began exporting the Pony to Canada, but not to the United States, as the Pony would not pass emissions standards there. Canadian sales greatly exceeded expectations, and it was at one point the top-selling car on the Canadian market. In 1985, the one millionth Hyundai car was built. Until the 1986 introduction of the larger Hyundai Grandeur, Hyundai offered a locally assembled Ford Granada for the South Korean executive market. The import of these knocked down kits was permitted as long as Hyundai exported five cars for every single Granada brought in (the same demands were placed on Kia).

In 1986, Hyundai began to sell cars in the United States, and the Excel was nominated as &quot;Best Product #10&quot; by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, largely because of its affordability. The company began to produce models with its own technology in 1988, beginning with the midsize Sonata. In the spring of 1990, aggregate production of Hyundai automobiles reached the four million mark. In 1991, the company succeeded in developing its first proprietary gasoline engine, the four-cylinder Alpha, and also its own transmission, thus paving the way for technological independence.

In 1996, Hyundai Motor India Limited was established with a production plant in Irungattukottai near Chennai, India.

In 1998, Hyundai began to overhaul its image in an attempt to establish itself as a world-class brand. Chung Ju-yung transferred leadership of Hyundai Motor to his son, Chung Mong-koo, in 1999. Hyundai&#x27;s parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, invested heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. It added a 10-year or warranty to cars sold in the United States and launched an aggressive marketing campaign.

In 2004, Hyundai was ranked second in &quot;initial quality&quot; in a survey/study by J.D. Power and Associates in North America. Hyundai is now one of the top 100 most valuable brands worldwide according to Interbrand. Since 2002, Hyundai has also been one of the worldwide official sponsors of the FIFA World Cup.

In 2006, the South Korean government initiated an investigation of Chung Mong-koo&#x27;s practices as head of Hyundai, suspecting him of corruption. On 28 April 2006, Chung was arrested, and charged for embezzlement of 100 billion South Korean won (US$106 million). As a result, Hyundai vice chairman and CEO, Kim Dong-jin, replaced him as head of the company.

On 30 September 2011, Yang Seung-suk announced his retirement as CEO of Hyundai Motor Co. In the interim replacement period, Chung Mong-koo and Kim Eok-jo divided the duties of the CEO position.

In 2014, Hyundai started an initiative to focus on improving vehicle dynamics in its vehicles and hired Albert Biermann, former Vice President of Engineering at BMW M, to direct chassis development for Hyundai vehicles, stating: &quot;The company intends to become a technical leader in ride and handling, producing vehicles that lead their respective segments for driver engagement.&quot;

On 14 October 2020, Euisun Chung was inaugurated as the new chairman of the Hyundai Motor Group. His father, Chung Mong-koo, has been made Honorary Chairman.

In April 2021, the company said that its profits rose by 187%, the highest rise in four years. The company recorded a profit of $1.16 billion from the beginning of 2021 until March.

In November 2024, the company announced that its Global Chief Operating Officer, Jose Munoz will hold the new role of global co-CEO beginning 1 January 2025. Munoz will be the first foreigner to hold such a high executive post in a giant South Korean conglomerate. The promotion is said to be credited to Munoz&#x27;s resilience and strategies in pushing for record sales in the North America region. 

=== Research and development ===
Hyundai has six research and development centers, located in South Korea (three offices), Germany, Japan and India. Additionally, a center in California develops designs for the United States.

Hyundai established the Hyundai Design Center in Fountain Valley, California in 1990. The center moved to a new $30 million facility in Irvine, California in 2003, and was renamed the Hyundai Kia Motors Design and Technical Center. The facility also housed Hyundai America Technical Center, Inc, a subsidiary responsible for all engineering activities in the U.S. for Hyundai. Hyundai America Technical Center moved to its new , $117 million headquarters in Superior Township, Michigan (near Ann Arbor) in 2005.

In 2004, Hyundai America Technical Center completed construction of its Hyundai/Kia proving ground in California City, California. The facility is located in the Mojave Desert and features a oval track, a Vehicle Dynamics Area, a vehicle-handling course inside the oval track, a paved hill road, and several special surface roads. A complex featuring offices and indoor testing areas is located on the premises as well. The facility was built at a cost of $50 million.

In the 2021 review of WIPO&#x27;s annual World Intellectual Property Indicators Hyundai ranked as 4th in the world for its 141 industrial design registrations being published under the Hague System during 2020. This position is up on their previous 7th-place ranking for 57 industrial design registrations being published in 2019.

=== Business ===

In 1998, after a shake-up in the South Korean auto industry caused by overambitious expansion and the Asian financial crisis, Hyundai acquired the majority of rival Kia Motors.

In 2000, the company established a strategic alliance with DaimlerChrysler and severed its partnership with the Hyundai Group. In 2001, the Daimler-Hyundai Truck Corporation was formed. In 2004, however, DaimlerChrysler divested its interest in the company by selling its 10.5% stake for $900 million.

Hyundai has invested in manufacturing plants in North America, India, the Czech Republic, Russia, China and Turkey as well as research and development centers in Europe, Asia, North America and the Pacific Rim. In 2004, Hyundai Motor Company had $57.2 billion in sales in South Korea making it the country&#x27;s second largest corporation, or chaebol, after Samsung. Worldwide sales in 2005 reached 2,533,695 units, an 11 percent increase over the previous year. In 2011, Hyundai sold 4.05 million cars worldwide and the Hyundai Motor Group was the world&#x27;s fourth largest automaker behind GM, Volkswagen and Toyota. Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through some 5,000 dealerships.

In February 2021, CNBC reported that Apple and Hyundai-Kia were close to finalizing a deal to build an autonomous Apple car. The vehicle was said to be completely designed by Apple and would be built in Hyundai or Kia plants; it could potentially have gone into production in 2024. However, Hyundai announced shortly after that it was no longer in talks with Apple.

In June 2021, Hyundai Motor Group completed its acquisition of a controlling interest in the robotics firm, Boston Dynamics. Hyundai Motor Group now takes an 80% share of the company.
In October 2024, Hyundai Motor said it had signed a 610-gigawatt-hour (GWh) power purchase agreement (PPA) with SK E&amp;S and other partners, the latest in its renewable energy transition efforts.

Bürkle had previously worked for BMW, having designed the BMW 3 Series (E46), and the BMW 6 Series (E63). Hyundai&#x27;s current design philosophy is known as &quot;Fluidic Sculpture&quot;, which is heavily inspired by nature.

In 2018, the company announced the &quot;Sensuous Sportiness&quot; next-generation design direction. The design philosophy was unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show demonstrated by the Le Fil Rouge concept car, and has been rolled out into their recent models, ranging from sedans to SUVs. The &quot;Sensuous Sportiness&quot; design identity and strategy has won Design Management Institute&#x27;s (DMI) Design Value Award 2020.

== Regional operations ==

=== North America ===

==== United States ====
Hyundai Motor America began selling cars in the United States on 20 February 1986, with a single model, the Hyundai Excel. That year, Hyundai set a record of selling the most automobiles in its first year of business in the United States compared to any other car brand; total sales in 1986 were 168,882.

Initially well received, the Excel&#x27;s faults soon became apparent; cost-cutting measures caused reliability to suffer. With an increasingly poor reputation for quality, Hyundai sales plummeted, and many dealerships either earned their profits on repairs or abandoned the product. At one point, Hyundai became the butt of many jokes (i.e. Hyundai stands for &quot;Hope you understand nothing&#x27;s driveable and inexpensive&quot;).

In response, Hyundai began investing heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. The company added free maintenance for the first 2 years or 24,000 miles for all its new cars sold, starting with the 1992 model year. It also added a 10-year or powertrain warranty (known as the Hyundai Advantage) to its vehicles sold in the United States, it is now known as the America Best Warranty.

Hyundai incorporated a new manufacturing facility, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, in April 2002. The new plant in Montgomery, Alabama, was completed during 2004, at a cost of $1.7 billion. Production started in May 2005. It employed more than 3,000 workers in 2012.

By 2004, sales had dramatically increased, and the reputation of Hyundai cars improved. In 2004, Hyundai tied with Honda for initial brand quality in a survey/study from J.D. Power and Associates, for having 102 problems per 1000 vehicles. This made Hyundai second in the industry, only behind Toyota, for initial vehicle quality. The company continued this tradition by placing third overall in J.D. Power&#x27;s 2006 Initial Quality Survey, behind only Porsche and Lexus.

In 2009, the Hyundai Genesis luxury sedan was named 2009 North American Car of the Year, the first for Hyundai. The model has received a number of well-recognized automobile awards worldwide. It also won the 2009 Canadian Car of the Year after winning its category of Best New Luxury Car under $50,000. The Hyundai&#x27;s V8 Tau engine in the Genesis received 2009 Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines award.

In January 2012, the Hyundai Elantra was named the North American Car of the Year at the North American International Auto Show, selling more than 200,000 cars since the model&#x27;s redesigned debut.

===== Supernal =====

The Hyundai Motor Company established Supernal, an urban air mobility (UAM) subsidiary, in the United States in 2020. The name means &quot;Best Quality&quot; and &quot;Heavenly&quot;. On 8 November 2023, Hyundai announced plans to build a plant in the US to produce flying taxis. As of February 2025, a full-scale technology demonstrator was undergoing ground testing.

The prototype uses wingtip tilting rotors and four propellers fixed on booms that connect the wing to a “Bronco tail”—named after the Rockwell OV-10 Bronco tail. In 2023, Supernal established its headquarters in Washington D.C., its research and development facility is in Fremont, California, and its engineering headquarters is in Irvine, California.

==== Canada ====

In 1989, Hyundai Auto Canada Inc. opened a stamping and assembly plant in Bromont, Quebec, employing 800. The plant cost $387.7 million, with Quebec and Canadian federal government subsidies of $131 million. The plant was designed to manufacture approximately 2000 Hyundai Sonatas per week. Subsequently, Chrysler and Hyundai considered a joint venture that would have Chrysler rebranding the Sonata manufactured at Bromont – only to later announce the deal had failed. The Bromont plant was operational for four years before it closed – with Hyundai&#x27;s sales unable to support the plant. With boost in sales in 2009, Hyundai Auto Canada Inc. is currently planning to build a new plant in Canada and resume production in Canada. Hyundai subsequently sold the plant, which was eventually purchased by Olymbec inc, a Quebec real estate developer. Hyundai is the No. 1 import car brand in Canada without a local plant. Sales over 100,000 cars-per-year mark in 2012.

==== Mexico ====
Hyundai Motor México entered the Mexican market in 2014 with the imported vehicles such as Grand i10, the Elantra, and the ix35. Soon afterwards, the Hyundai Sonata joined the lineup. Prior to the introduction of the Hyundai brand for non-commercial vehicles, Hyundai passenger vehicles, light-duty cargo vans, and passenger vans were distributed by Chrysler de México, branded as Dodge.

=== South America ===
==== Brazil ====
In October 2012, Hyundai launched a new small bi-fuel car, the HB20, designed specifically for the Brazilian mass-market. The car was developed under the &quot;Projeto HB&quot; (Hyundai Brazil) project, and is built at a new Hyundai factory in Brazil, located in Piracicaba, São Paulo. The plant is the first wholly owned Hyundai plant in Latin America. With an investment of around R$1.2 billion, the plant has the capacity to produce 180,000 cars per year under three shifts.

=== Asia ===

==== China ====

Hyundai cars, including those made by Hyundai&#x27;s affiliate, Kia Motors, sold well in China until 2016, when sales fell by half, marking the start of a slump that continued into 2019, when the company announced plans to cut jobs in the region.

Hyundai is currently working with its Chinese partner Beijing Automobile Industry Holding Co. to develop an electric car for sale only in China. In September 2011, it was announced that Korean actor Lee Min-ho, who has enjoyed popularity in China, would promote Hyundai&#x27;s new &#x27;Veloster&#x27; in China.

Hyundai and its sister company, Kia, were reported to have lost market share from 2017 because of their over-reliance on sedans, poor brand images and local Chinese automakers compete with price-competitive SUVs.

===== Beijing Hyundai =====

Hyundai formed a 50-50 joint venture with Beijing Automotive Group since 2002 to produce cars in China. The joint venture is called Beijing Hyundai, which also manufactures several models which are exclusive to the Chinese market. It began operations in China by producing Sonata in December 2002. The joint venture sold 700,000 passenger cars in 2010, 855,995 car sales in 2012, and 2014 saw the company sell 1,120,000 vehicles. Currently, the company operates five plants, three which is located in Beijing, one in Hubei, and another in Chongqing.

===== Hawtai partnership =====
Between 2002 and 2010, Hawtai Motor had produced Chinese-market versions of the Hyundai Matrix, the Hyundai Santa Fe and the Hyundai Terracan. The Santa Fe was the fifth most-purchased SUV in China in 2010, and some of Hawtai&#x27;s versions may greatly differ from those sold in other markets. Hyundai ended its partnership with Hawtai in 2010.

===== Commercial vehicles =====
In October 2010, Hyundai signed an agreement with Sichuan Nanjun Automobile on setting up a commercial vehicle joint venture—Sichuan Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd.

==== India ====
Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) was formed on 6 May 1996. During the entry of Hyundai in 1996, fellow South Korean Daewoo had entered the Indian automobile market just three years before, while Ford, Opel and Honda had entered less than a year back. Hyundai&#x27;s first car in the country, the Hyundai Santro was launched on 23 September 1998 and was considered a success. It became the second best-selling car in the country from 2000.

Hyundai Motor India Limited is currently the second largest auto exporter from India. It is making India the global manufacturing base for small cars.

Hyundai has two manufacturing plants in India located at Sriperumbudur in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Both plants have a combined annual capacity of 600,000 units. In the year 2007, Hyundai opened its R&amp;D facility in Hyderabad, employing now nearly 450 engineers from different parts of the country. Hyundai Motor India Engineering (HMIE) gives technical &amp; engineering support in vehicle development to Hyundai&#x27;s main R&amp;D centre in Namyang, Korea.

In June 2017, The Competition Commission of India imposed ₹87 crore ($13.6 million) penalty for unfair business practices with respect to providing discounts for cars.

Bangladesh

Fair Technology in Bangladesh inaugurated the first Hyundai car manufacturing plant in partnership with Hyundai in Bangabandhu Hi-Tech Park on 19 January 2023. The current focus is on importing Completely Knocked Down (CKD) parts and assembling those in the facility. The plant is expected to manufacture 10,000 cars per year.

==== Japan ====
Hyundai started to market its vehicles in 2001.

Despite having growing sales worldwide, Hyundai struggled in Japan, having sold only 15,095 passenger cars from 2001 to 2009. Following an announcement in November 2009, Hyundai pulled their passenger car division out of the Japanese market and focused on their commercial vehicle division instead. The company said that it is possible for them to come back to Japan fully if market conditions continue to improve.

According to the newspaper &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot;, the reason for Hyundai&#x27;s failure in the car market was due to the company&#x27;s inability to recognize the value of small cars due to parking spaces. For instance, actor Bae Yong-joon was hired to endorse the mid-sized Sonata in Japan to appeal to housewives who watched the drama &quot;Winter Sonata&quot;. The marketing campaign backfired, as large sedans are driven primarily by middle-aged men, while housewives prefer compact cars. In addition, the Sonata was priced too similarly to its Japanese rivals, which resulted in poor sales.

On 9 February 2022, Hyundai announced a comeback to Japan by marketing eco-friendly vehicles like the Ioniq 5 and Nexo with pre-orders from May 2022 for delivery beginning in July 2022 under the company name &quot;Hyundai Mobility Japan&quot;. As of 2022, Hyundai Mobility Japan operates an office and R&amp;D center in Yokohoma. In addition, they only operate their sales through online means only.

HARI currently focuses on Jeepneys, Trucks and Buses, while HMPH focuses on Cars, SUVs and Passenger Vans.

Hyundai Asia Resources, Inc. (HARI) was the distributor of Hyundai passenger cars and currently the official distributor of Hyundai commercial vehicles in the country. They were appointed by Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea in August 2001 as the official distributor of Hyundai vehicles in the Philippines. It had earned its spot as the third top player in the Philippine automotive industry. But due to the outrage of COVID-19 pandemic, they decided to abandon the passenger car market which resulted to their sales decline and the numerous of controversies surrounds them even before the pandemic. HARI has expected sales to be further boosted by its Hyundai Modern Jeepneys with the implementation of the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program. HARI targets to sell more modern jeepneys as the government pushes for the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program to replace the country&#x27;s aging jeepneys.

In early 2022, Hyundai Motor Philippines, Inc. (HMPH) became the official distributor of Hyundai passenger cars in the country after the company was able to take over its passenger car operations from HARI, Audrey Byun is the CEO, while Lee Dong-wook is the President and Victor Jose Vela is the Deputy General Manager of the company. They started their operations on 1 June 2022, and also, they have unveiled 4 new models, which are the following: the Creta subcompact crossover, the Tucson compact crossover, the Santa Fe mid-size crossover and the Staria passenger van through a dealer conference on 20 June 2022.

=== Crossovers/SUVs ===

Hyundai entered the crossover SUV market early with the Santa Fe in 2000, followed by the smaller Tucson in 2004. The Santa Fe was a huge hit with American and European markets, despite receiving criticism in the past for Hyundai&#x27;s obscure looks. It quickly became Hyundai&#x27;s best seller and was one of the reasons Hyundai survived despite having their sales declined. As of 2020, Hyundai has sold more than 5,260,000 units of Santa Fe globally.

The first-generation Tucson shared its Elantra-based platform with the Kia Sportage.

Currently, Hyundai produces 12 crossover SUV models for different markets.

=== Hybrid and electric vehicles ===

Hyundai Motor Company began developing flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) in 1988. The test vehicle was 1991 MY Scoupe FFV. Since March 1992, in Seoul, Korea, through at least November 1993, field trials of several FFVs had been performed over more than 30,000 miles.

The new hybrid-electric FGV-1 was unveiled at the Seoul Motor Show in 1995 which featured full-time electric drive technology. The 1995 FGV-1 was the result of Hyundai&#x27;s first experiments with hybrid propulsion systems in 1994. The FGV-2 was the second vehicle to be produced. The company is using the &quot;parallel&quot; type design, which utilizes either the internal combustion engine or the electric motor. Others are the Elantra HEV and the Hyundai Accent HEV, which were unveiled in 1999 and 2000, respectively.

The first pure electric car developed by Hyundai was the Sonata Electric Vehicle in 1991. The car started as a Sonata sedan-based model. Hyundai planned to have six electric vehicles available for testing by the end of 1992.

Hyundai began mass-producing hybrid electric vehicles in 2008. The company is using Hybrid Blue Drive, which includes lithium polymer batteries, as opposed to lithium-ion. The new hybrid Sonata made its debut at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November 2008. The 2011 Sonata Hybrid sales in the U.S. began in February 2011.

In 2016, Hyundai revealed the Ioniq five-door liftback to rival the Toyota Prius. The nameplate &quot;Ioniq&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;ion&quot; and &quot;unique&quot;. It is the first automobile to be offered in hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and all-electric variants with no &quot;standard&quot; internal combustion engine only version. The hybrid variant launched in its home market in February 2016, followed by the electric model in July 2016. The plug-in hybrid version followed in February 2017.

In August 2020, the company announced the launch of Ioniq as its own new electric brand and confirmed three new electric cars that will be sold under the sub-brand. Ioniq is Hyundai&#x27;s second stand-alone brand after the Genesis. The new brand is going to utilise Hyundai&#x27;s Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), which they claims will enable &quot;fast charging capability and plentiful driving range.&quot; The automaker said the first of the three new global models will be the Ioniq 5, a midsize crossover, arriving in early 2021. It will be followed by the Ioniq 6 sedan in late 2022, and then by the Ioniq 7, a large SUV, in early 2024. New models will be named numerically, with even numbers for sedans, and odd numbers for SUVs.

In December 2020, Hyundai Motor Group announced details about its E-GMP platform that will be the underpinning of new Hyundai and Kia electric vehicles starting in 2021. Apart from Hyundai, Ioniq, and Kia brands, it will also be used for future Genesis electric cars. The platform&#x27;s main components is a battery pack under the cabin and an all-in-one motor, transmission, and inverter designed and developed by Hyundai. By bundling the components, Hyundai said, it raised the maximum speed of the motor by up to 70 percent compared to existing motors, despite its small size. The company claimed that it is capable to handle power output up to from the system.

In February 2020, Hyundai launched its first vehicle built above the E-GMP platform, the Ioniq 5. It is the first product to be marketed under the Ioniq sub-brand. At its introduction, it is the most advanced electric vehicle produced by Hyundai. Its battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in 18 minutes with its 800 V charging capabilities by using a 350-kW charger. A five minutes charge will add to its range by WLTP standards. Its claimed maximum range is for the rear-wheel-drive 72.6 kWh variant.

In July 2022, Hyundai announced its new automotive factory in South Korea, solely dedicated for electric vehicles and with production set to begin in 2025. It will be the first Hyundai plant to open in South Korea since 1996.

Hyundai is currently expanding its full-electric lineup by adding the Ioniq 6 to its lineup, which debuted in Europe in the second half of 2022, and in the United States in spring of 2023. Hyundai is also expanding its full-electric lineup with the Ioniq 7, which is projected to hit the market in 2024.

=== Hydrogen vehicles ===
In March 2018, Hyundai launched a hydrogen powered crossover SUV the Nexo. In October 2020, South Korean domestic sales of the Nexo exceeded 10,000 vehicles. As of July 2020, Hyundai had exported only 769 vehicles to the United States and Europe with supply limited due to domestic demand.

In 2020, Hyundai launched a hydrogen powered version of its Xcient truck the Xcient Fuel Cell delivering seven vehicles to customers in Switzerland. The Xcient Fuel Cell is the world&#x27;s first production hydrogen fuel cell truck. In 2019, Hyundai formed Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility (HHM) together with Swiss company H2 Energy to lease trucks to Swiss customers with plans to deliver 50 trucks by 2020. Hyundai chose to launch in Switzerland as its road tax does not apply to zero-emission trucks and for its ability to produce hydrogen using hydropower. HHM formed a partnership with Hydrospider, a joint venture of H2Energy, Alpiq and Linde to produce hydrogen and to build hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in Switzerland. The 34-ton Xcient Fuel Cell has a 190 kW fuel cell supported by a 73 kW battery pack that stores energy from the fuel cell and from braking, seven hydrogen tanks, a maximum speed of , a driving range of about and a refueling time of between 8 and 20 minutes.

In 2020, Hyundai launched a hydrogen powered version of its Elec City bus the Elec City FCEV that has a capacity of 44 passengers with 24 seats and 20 standing seats. The bus has a 180 kW fuel cell supported by a 156 kW battery pack, five hydrogen tanks, a driving range of and a refuelling time of 15 minutes. In 2020, Hyundai exported two buses to Saudi Arabian oil company Saudi Aramco for demonstration.

== Scandals ==
=== Inflated fuel economy numbers ===
After an investigation in 2012, the EPA found that 35% of all 2011–2013 Hyundai and Kia vehicles had inflated fuel economy numbers; by as much as six miles per gallon. Currently, Hyundai and Kia have started a reimbursement program for the owners of the 2011–2013 affected vehicles.
 In 2014 the company was issued $350 million in penalties by the US government, agreed to pay $395 million in 2013 to resolve claims from vehicles owners, and agreed to pay $41.2 million to cover the &quot;investigative costs&quot; of 33 US state attorneys general.

=== Wrongly advertised engine and horsepower ===
Several consumers complained that the engine delivered with the Hyundai Veloster in Brazil was inferior to the one advertised. Independent tests confirmed that it was not the same engine, and it delivered only instead of the advertised , with the car earning derogatory nicknames like Slowster in the Brazilian market.

=== Marketing controversy ===
In April 2013, Hyundai Motors UK released a commercial depicting a man attempting to commit suicide via carbon monoxide poisoning in an ix35, only to fail to do so because of the vehicle&#x27;s non-toxic emissions. The advert, produced by Hyundai&#x27;s in-house agency Innocean Worldwide, received widespread criticism for promoting suicide. Hyundai has since taken down the video and issued a formal apology.

=== Vehicle security vulnerability ===

Since October 2022, following a TikTok trend, Hyundai vehicles especially in North America are highly targeted for theft due to their weaker security systems. Hyundai vehicles manufactured from 2016 to 2021 for the U.S. market that are not equipped with optional key fob and a push-button start mechanism lack immobilizers, a system that prevent the engine from being started unless a proper key is inserted. A video posted on TikTok depicted the theft process, which involves inserting a USB connector on a naked key slot and successfully starts a car. The vulnerability also affects vehicles produced by sister company Kia.

Hyundai and Kia acknowledged the vulnerability. Hyundai introduced a free anti-theft software patch starting February 14, 2023, with all eligible vehicles patched by June 23, 2023. Models that cannot be upgraded will have steering wheel lock reimbursements. Both companies also agreed to pay about $200 million to settle a U.S. class-action lawsuit, including up to $145 million for car owners&#x27; out-of-pocket losses. The settlement, announced on May 18, 2023, was rejected by a federal judge.

According to U.S. authority National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the trend has led to eight fatalities in the country.

=== U.S. child labor allegations ===

In 2022, Hyundai and its parts suppliers in the U.S. were discovered to be illegally employing child labor, primarily involving refugees from Central America. This issue involved parts suppliers, including Hyundai subsidiaries Hyundai Glovis and SMART, SL, Hwashin, and AJIN, many of which used temporary work agencies to recruit underage workers. These suppliers hired minors, some as young as 12, to operate heavy machinery, in direct violation of child labor laws. Following a Reuters report in July 2022, investigations confirmed these illegal practices, leading to fines and sanctions against several suppliers. In response to the scandal, Hyundai announced plans to divest its controlling stake in SMART.

<text>Irrigation (also referred to as watering of plants) is the practice of applying controlled amounts of water to land to help grow crops, landscape plants, and lawns. Irrigation has been a key aspect of agriculture for over 5,000 years and has been developed by many cultures around the world. Irrigation helps to grow crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate disturbed soils in dry areas and during times of below-average rainfall. In addition to these uses, irrigation is also employed to protect crops from frost, suppress weed growth in grain fields, and prevent soil consolidation. It is also used to cool livestock, reduce dust, dispose of sewage, and support mining operations. Drainage, which involves the removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given location, is often studied in conjunction with irrigation.

There are several methods of irrigation that differ in how water is supplied to plants. Surface irrigation, also known as gravity irrigation, is the oldest form of irrigation and has been in use for thousands of years. In sprinkler irrigation, water is piped to one or more central locations within the field and distributed by overhead high-pressure water devices. Micro-irrigation is a system that distributes water under low pressure through a piped network and applies it as a small discharge to each plant. Micro-irrigation uses less pressure and water flow than sprinkler irrigation. Drip irrigation delivers water directly to the root zone of plants. Subirrigation has been used in field crops in areas with high water tables for many years. It involves artificially raising the water table to moisten the soil below the root zone of plants.

Irrigation water can come from groundwater (extracted from springs or by using wells), from surface water (withdrawn from rivers, lakes or reservoirs) or from non-conventional sources like treated wastewater, desalinated water, drainage water, or fog collection. Irrigation can be supplementary to rainfall, which is common in many parts of the world as rainfed agriculture, or it can be full irrigation, where crops rarely rely on any contribution from rainfall. Full irrigation is less common and only occurs in arid landscapes with very low rainfall or when crops are grown in semi-arid areas outside of rainy seasons.

The environmental effects of irrigation relate to the changes in quantity and quality of soil and water as a result of irrigation and the subsequent effects on natural and social conditions in river basins and downstream of an irrigation scheme. The effects stem from the altered hydrological conditions caused by the installation and operation of the irrigation scheme. Amongst some of these problems is depletion of underground aquifers through overdrafting. Soil can be over-irrigated due to poor distribution uniformity or management wastes water, chemicals, and may lead to water pollution. Over-irrigation can cause deep drainage from rising water tables that can lead to problems of irrigation salinity requiring watertable control by some form of subsurface land drainage.
== Extent ==
In 2000, the total fertile land was 2,788,000 km2 (689 million acres) and it was equipped with irrigation infrastructure worldwide. About 68% of this area is in Asia, 17% in the Americas, 9% in Europe, 5% in Africa and 1% in Oceania. The largest contiguous areas of high irrigation density are found in Northern and Eastern India and Pakistan along the Ganges and Indus rivers; in the Hai He, Huang He and Yangtze basins in China; along the Nile river in Egypt and Sudan; and in the Mississippi-Missouri river basin, the Southern Great Plains, and in parts of California in the United States. Smaller irrigation areas are spread across almost all populated parts of the world.

By 2012, the area of irrigated land had increased to an estimated total of 3,242,917 km2 (801 million acres), which is nearly the size of India. The irrigation of 20% of farming land accounts for the production of 40% of food production.

=== Global overview ===
The scale of irrigation increased dramatically over the 20th century. In 1800, 8 million hectares globally were irrigated, in 1950, 94 million hectares, and in 1990, 235 million hectares. By 1990, 30% of the global food production came from irrigated land. Irrigation techniques across the globe includes canals redirecting surface water, groundwater pumping, and diverting water from dams. National governments lead most irrigation schemes within their borders, but private investors and other nations, especially the United States, China, and European countries like the United Kingdom, also fund and organize some schemes within other nations.

By 2021 the global land area equipped for irrigation reached 352 million ha, an increase of 22% from the 289 million ha of 2000 and more than twice the 1960s land area equipped for irrigation. The vast majority is located in Asia (70%), where irrigation was a key component of the green revolution; the Americas account for 16% and Europe for 8% of the world total. India (76 million ha) and China (75 million ha) have the largest equipped area for irrigation, far ahead of the United States o fAmerica (27 million ha). China and India also have the largest net gains in equipped area between 2000 and 2020 (+21 million ha for China and +15 million ha for India). All the regions saw increases in the area equipped for irrigation, with Africa growing the fastest (+29%), followed by Asia (+25%), Oceania (+24%), the Americas (+19%) and Europe (+2%).

Irrigation enables the production of more crops, especially commodity crops in areas which otherwise could not support them. Countries frequently invested in irrigation to increase wheat, rice, or cotton production, often with the overarching goal of increasing self-sufficiency.

=== Groundwater and surface water ===


Irrigation water can come from groundwater (extracted from springs or by using wells), from surface water (withdrawn from rivers, lakes or reservoirs) or from non-conventional sources like treated wastewater, desalinated water, drainage water, or fog collection.

While floodwater harvesting belongs to the accepted irrigation methods, rainwater harvesting is usually not considered as a form of irrigation. Rainwater harvesting is the collection of runoff water from roofs or unused land and the concentration of this.

=== Treated or untreated wastewater ===

=== Other sources ===
Irrigation water can also come from non-conventional sources like treated wastewater, desalinated water, drainage water, or fog collection.

In countries where humid air sweeps through at night, water can be obtained by condensation onto cold surfaces. This is practiced in the vineyards at Lanzarote using stones to condense water. Fog collectors are also made of canvas or foil sheets. Using condensate from air conditioning units as a water source is also becoming more popular in large urban areas.

 a Glasgow-based startup has helped a farmer in Scotland to establish edible saltmarsh crops irrigated with sea water. An acre of previously marginal land has been put under cultivation to grow samphire, sea blite, and sea aster; these plants yield a higher profit than potatoes. The land is flood irrigated twice a day to simulate tidal flooding; the water is pumped from the sea using wind power. Additional benefits are soil remediation and carbon sequestration.

=== Competition for water resources ===

Until the 1960s, there were fewer than half the number of people on the planet as of 2024. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water humans presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for water resources is much more intense, because there are now more than seven billion people on the planet, increasing the likelihood of overconsumption of food produced by water-thirsty animal agriculture and intensive farming practices. This creates increasing competition for water from industry, urbanisation and biofuel crops. Farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.

Successful agriculture is dependent upon farmers having sufficient access to water. However, water scarcity is already a critical constraint to farming in many parts of the world.

== Irrigation methods ==
There are several methods of irrigation. They vary in how the water is supplied to the plants. The goal is to apply the water to the plants as uniformly as possible, so that each plant has the amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little. Irrigation can also be understood whether it is &quot;supplementary&quot; to rainfall as happens in many parts of the world, or whether it is &quot;&#x27;full&quot; irrigation&#x27; whereby crops rarely depend on any contribution from rainfall. Full irrigation is less common and only happens in arid landscapes experiencing very low rainfall or when crops are grown in semi-arid areas outside of any rainy seasons.

===Surface irrigation===


Surface irrigation, also known as gravity irrigation, is the oldest form of irrigation and has been in use for thousands of years. In &quot;surface&quot; (&quot;furrow,&quot; &quot;flood&quot;, or &quot;level basin&quot;) irrigation systems, water moves across the surface of agricultural lands, in order to wet it and infiltrate into the soil. Water moves by following gravity or the slope of the land. Surface irrigation can be subdivided into furrow,&quot; border strip or basin irrigation&quot;. It is often called &quot;flood irrigation&quot; when the irrigation results in flooding or near flooding of the cultivated land. Historically, surface irrigation is the most common method of irrigating agricultural land across most parts of the world. The water application efficiency of surface irrigation is typically lower than other forms of irrigation, due in part to the lack of control of applied depths. Surface irrigation involves a significantly lower capital cost and energy requirement than pressurised irrigation systems. Hence it is often the irrigation choice for developing nations, for low value crops and for large fields. Where water levels from the irrigation source permit, the levels are controlled by dikes (levees), usually plugged by soil. This is often seen in terraced rice fields (rice paddies), where the method is used to flood or control the level of water in each distinct field. In some cases, the water is pumped, or lifted by human or animal power to the level of the land.

Surface irrigation is even used to water urban gardens in certain areas, for example, in and around Phoenix, Arizona. The irrigated area is surrounded by a berm and the water is delivered according to a schedule set by a local irrigation district.

A special form of irrigation using surface water is spate irrigation, also called floodwater harvesting. In case of a flood (spate), water is diverted to normally dry river beds (wadis) using a network of dams, gates and channels and spread over large areas. The moisture stored in the soil will be used thereafter to grow crops. Spate irrigation areas are in particular located in semi-arid or arid, mountainous regions.

===Micro-irrigation===

&quot;Micro-irrigation&quot;, sometimes called localized irrigation, low volume irrigation, or trickle irrigation is a system where water is distributed under low pressure through a piped network, in a pre-determined pattern, and applied as a small discharge to each plant or adjacent to it. Traditional drip irrigation use individual emitters, subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), micro-spray or micro-sprinklers, and mini-bubbler irrigation all belong to this category of irrigation methods.

==== Drip irrigation ====

Drip irrigation, also known as microirrigation or trickle irrigation, functions as its name suggests. In this system, water is delivered at or near the root zone of plants, one drop at a time. This method can be the most water-efficient method of irrigation, if managed properly; evaporation and runoff are minimized. The field water efficiency of drip irrigation is typically in the range of 80 to 90% when managed correctly.

In modern agriculture, drip irrigation is often combined with plastic mulch, further reducing evaporation, and is also the means of delivery of fertilizer. The process is known as fertigation.

Deep percolation, where water moves below the root zone, can occur if a drip system is operated for too long or if the delivery rate is too high. Drip irrigation methods range from very high-tech and computerized to low-tech and labor-intensive. Lower water pressures are usually needed than for most other types of systems, with the exception of low-energy center pivot systems and surface irrigation systems, and the system can be designed for uniformity throughout a field or for precise water delivery to individual plants in a landscape containing a mix of plant species. Although it is difficult to regulate pressure on steep slopes, pressure compensating emitters are available, so the field does not have to be level. High-tech solutions involve precisely calibrated emitters located along lines of tubing that extend from a computerized set of valves.

=== Sprinkler irrigation ===


In &quot;sprinkler&quot; or overhead irrigation, water is piped to one or more central locations within the field and distributed by overhead high-pressure sprinklers or guns. A system using sprinklers, sprays, or guns mounted overhead on permanently installed risers is often referred to as a &quot;solid-set&quot; irrigation system. Higher pressure sprinklers that rotate are called &quot;rotors&quot; and are driven by a ball drive, gear drive, or impact mechanism. Rotors can be designed to rotate in a full or partial circle. Guns are similar to rotors, except that they generally operate at very high pressures of 275 to 900 kPa (40 to 130 psi) and flows of 3 to 76 L/s (50 to 1200 US gal/min), usually with nozzle diameters in the range of 10 to 50 mm (0.5 to 1.9 in). Guns are used not only for irrigation, but also for industrial applications such as dust suppression and logging.

Sprinklers can also be mounted on moving platforms connected to the water source by a hose. Automatically moving wheeled systems known as &quot;traveling sprinklers&quot; may irrigate areas such as small farms, sports fields, parks, pastures, and cemeteries unattended. Most of these use a length of polyethylene tubing wound on a steel drum. As the tubing is wound on the drum powered by the irrigation water or a small gas engine, the sprinkler is pulled across the field. When the sprinkler arrives back at the reel the system shuts off. This type of system is known to most people as a &quot;waterreel&quot; traveling irrigation sprinkler and they are used extensively for dust suppression, irrigation, and land application of waste water.

Other travelers use a flat rubber hose that is dragged along behind while the sprinkler platform is pulled by a cable.

==== Center pivot ====


Center pivot irrigation is a form of sprinkler irrigation utilising several segments of pipe (usually galvanized steel or aluminium) joined and supported by trusses, mounted on wheeled towers with sprinklers positioned along its length.
The system moves in a circular pattern and is fed with water from the pivot point at the center of the arc. These systems are found and used in all parts of the world and allow irrigation of all types of terrain. Newer systems have drop sprinkler heads as shown in the image that follows.

 most center pivot systems have drops hanging from a U-shaped pipe attached at the top of the pipe with sprinkler heads that are positioned a few feet (at most) above the crop, thus limiting evaporative losses. Drops can also be used with drag hoses or bubblers that deposit the water directly on the ground between crops. Crops are often planted in a circle to conform to the center pivot. This type of system is known as LEPA (Low Energy Precision Application). Originally, most center pivots were water-powered. These were replaced by hydraulic systems (&quot;T-L Irrigation&quot;) and electric-motor-driven systems (Reinke, Valley, Zimmatic). Many modern pivots feature GPS devices.

==== Irrigation by lateral move (side roll, wheel line, wheelmove) ====

A series of pipes, each with a wheel of about 1.5 m diameter permanently affixed to its midpoint, and sprinklers along its length, are coupled together. Water is supplied at one end using a large hose. After sufficient irrigation has been applied to one strip of the field, the hose is removed, the water drained from the system, and the assembly rolled either by hand or with a purpose-built mechanism, so that the sprinklers are moved to a different position across the field. The hose is reconnected. The process is repeated in a pattern until the whole field has been irrigated.

This system is less expensive to install than a center pivot, but much more labor-intensive to operate – it does not travel automatically across the field: it applies water in a stationary strip, must be drained, and then rolled to a new strip. Most systems use 100 or 130 mm (4 or 5 inch) diameter aluminum pipe. The pipe doubles both as water transport and as an axle for rotating all the wheels. A drive system (often found near the centre of the wheel line) rotates the clamped-together pipe sections as a single axle, rolling the whole wheel line. Manual adjustment of individual wheel positions may be necessary if the system becomes misaligned.

Wheel line systems are limited in the amount of water they can carry, and limited in the height of crops that can be irrigated. One useful feature of a lateral move system is that it consists of sections that can be easily disconnected, adapting to field shape as the line is moved. They are most often used for small, rectilinear, or oddly-shaped fields, hilly or mountainous regions, or in regions where labor is inexpensive.

==== Lawn sprinkler systems ====
A lawn sprinkler system is permanently installed, as opposed to a hose-end sprinkler, which is portable. Sprinkler systems are installed in residential lawns, in commercial landscapes, for churches and schools, in public parks and cemeteries, and on golf courses. Most of the components of these irrigation systems are hidden under ground, since aesthetics are important in a landscape. A typical lawn sprinkler system will consist of one or more zones, limited in size by the capacity of the water source. Each zone will cover a designated portion of the landscape. Sections of the landscape will usually be divided by microclimate, type of plant material, and type of irrigation equipment. A landscape irrigation system may also include zones containing drip irrigation, bubblers, or other types of equipment besides sprinklers.

Although manual systems are still used, most lawn sprinkler systems may be operated automatically using an irrigation controller, sometimes called a clock or timer. Most automatic systems employ electric solenoid valves. Each zone has one or more of these valves that are wired to the controller. When the controller sends power to the valve, the valve opens, allowing water to flow to the sprinklers in that zone.

There are two main types of sprinklers used in lawn irrigation, pop-up spray heads and rotors. Spray heads have a fixed spray pattern, while rotors have one or more streams that rotate. Spray heads are used to cover smaller areas, while rotors are used for larger areas. Golf course rotors are sometimes so large that a single sprinkler is combined with a valve and called a &#x27;valve in head&#x27;. When used in a turf area, the sprinklers are installed with the top of the head flush with the ground surface. When the system is pressurized, the head will pop up out of the ground and water the desired area until the valve closes and shuts off that zone. Once there is no more pressure in the lateral line, the sprinkler head will retract back into the ground. In flower beds or shrub areas, sprinklers may be mounted on above ground risers or even taller pop-up sprinklers may be used and installed flush as in a lawn area.

==== Hose-end sprinklers ====

Hose-end sprinklers are devices attached to the end of a garden hose, used for watering lawns, gardens, or plants. They come in a variety of designs and styles, allowing you to adjust the water flow, pattern, and range for efficient irrigation. Some common types of hose-end sprinklers include:

Oscillating Sprinklers: These spray water back and forth in a rectangular or square pattern. They are good for covering large, flat areas evenly.

Impact (or Pulsating) Sprinklers: These create a rotating, pulsating spray, which can cover a circular or semi-circular area. They are useful for watering large lawns.

Stationary Sprinklers: These have a fixed spray pattern and are best for smaller areas or gardens.

Rotary Sprinklers: These use spinning arms to distribute water in a circular or semi-circular pattern.

Traveling Sprinklers: These move along the hose path on their own, watering as they go, ideal for covering long, narrow spaces.

Each type offers different advantages based on garden size and shape, water pressure, and specific watering needs.

=== Subirrigation ===
Subirrigation has been used for many years in field crops in areas with high water tables. It is a method of artificially raising the water table to allow the soil to be from below the plants&#x27; root zone. Often those systems are located on permanent grasslands in lowlands or river valleys and combined with drainage infrastructure. A system of pumping stations, canals, weirs and gates allows it to increase or decrease the water level in a network of ditches and thereby control the water table.

Subirrigation is also used in the commercial greenhouse production, usually for potted plants. Water is delivered from below, absorbed by upwards, and the excess collected for recycling. Typically, a solution of water and nutrients floods a container or flows through a trough for a short period of time, 10–20 minutes, and is then pumped back into a holding tank for reuse. Sub-irrigation in greenhouses requires fairly sophisticated, expensive equipment and management. Advantages are water and nutrient conservation, and labor savings through reduced system maintenance and automation. It is similar in principle and action to subsurface basin irrigation.

Another type of subirrigation is the self-watering container, also known as a sub-irrigated planter. This consists of a planter suspended over a reservoir with some type of wicking material such as a polyester rope. The water is drawn up the wick through capillary action. A similar technique is the wicking bed; this too uses capillary action.

== Efficiency ==
Modern irrigation methods are efficient enough to supply the entire field uniformly with water, so that each plant has the amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little. Water use efficiency in the field can be determined as follows:
* Field Water Efficiency (%) = (Water Transpired by Crop ÷ Water Applied to Field) x 100

Increased irrigation efficiency has a number of positive outcomes for the farmer, the community and the wider environment. Low application efficiency infers that the amount of water applied to the field is in excess of the crop or field requirements. Increasing the application efficiency means that the amount of crop produced per unit of water increases. Improved efficiency may either be achieved by applying less water to an existing field or by using water more wisely thereby achieving higher yields in the same area of land. In some parts of the world, farmers are charged for irrigation water hence over-application has a direct financial cost to the farmer. Irrigation often requires pumping energy (either electricity or fossil fuel) to deliver water to the field or supply the correct operating pressure. Hence increased efficiency will reduce both the water cost and energy cost per unit of agricultural production. A reduction of water use on one field may mean that the farmer is able to irrigate a larger area of land, increasing total agricultural production. Low efficiency usually means that excess water is lost through seepage or runoff, both of which can result in loss of crop nutrients or pesticides with potential adverse impacts on the surrounding environment.

Improving the efficiency of irrigation is usually achieved in one of two ways, either by improving the system design or by optimising the irrigation management. Improving system design includes conversion from one form of irrigation to another (e.g. from furrow to drip irrigation) and also through small changes in the current system (for example changing flowrates and operating pressures). Irrigation management refers to the scheduling of irrigation events and decisions around how much water is applied.

== Challenges ==

=== Environmental impacts ===
Negative impacts frequently accompany extensive irrigation. Some projects which diverted surface water for irrigation dried up the water sources, which led to a more extreme regional climate. Projects that relied on groundwater and pumped too much from underground aquifers created subsidence and salinization. Salinization of irrigation water in turn damaged the crops and seeped into drinking water. Pests and pathogens also thrived in the irrigation canals or ponds full of still water, which created regional outbreaks of diseases like malaria and schistosomiasis. Governments also used irrigation schemes to encourage migration, especially of more desirable populations into an area. Additionally, some of these large nationwide schemes failed to pay off at all, costing more than any benefit gained from increased crop yields.

Overdrafting (depletion) of underground aquifers: In the mid-20th century, the advent of diesel and electric motors led to systems that could pump groundwater out of major aquifers faster than drainage basins could refill them. This can lead to permanent loss of aquifer capacity, decreased water quality, ground subsidence, and other problems. The future of food production in such areas as the North China Plain, the Punjab region in India and Pakistan, and the Great Plains of the US is threatened by this phenomenon.

=== Technical challenges ===

Irrigation schemes involve solving numerous engineering and economic problems while minimizing negative environmental consequences. Such problems include:
* Ground subsidence (e.g. New Orleans, Louisiana)
* Underirrigation or irrigation giving only just enough water for the plant (e.g. in drip line irrigation) gives poor soil salinity control which leads to increased soil salinity with consequent buildup of toxic salts on soil surface in areas with high evaporation. This requires either leaching to remove these salts and a method of drainage to carry the salts away. When using drip lines, the leaching is best done regularly at certain intervals (with only a slight excess of water), so that the salt is flushed back under the plant&#x27;s roots.
* because of poor distribution uniformity or management wastes water, chemicals, and may lead to water pollution.
* Deep drainage (from over-irrigation) may result in rising water tables which in some instances will lead to problems of irrigation salinity requiring watertable control by some form of subsurface land drainage. For example in Australia, over-abstraction of fresh water for intensive irrigation activities has caused 33% of the land area to be at risk of salination.
* Drainage front instability, also known as viscous fingering, where an unstable drainage front results in a pattern of fingers and viscous entrapped saturated zones.
* Irrigation with saline or high-sodium water may damage soil structure owing to the formation of alkaline soil.
* Clogging of filters: algae can clog filters, drip installations, and nozzles. Chlorination, algaecide, UV and ultrasonic methods can be used for algae control in irrigation systems.
* Complications in accurately measuring irrigation performance which changes over time and space using measures such as productivity, efficiency, equity and adequacy.
* Macro-irrigation, typical in intensive agriculture, where also are used agrochemicals, often causes eutrophication.

=== Social aspects ===
* Competition for surface water rights and territory defense.
* Assisting smallholders in sustainably and collectively managing irrigation technology and changes in technology.

== History ==

=== Ancient history ===
Archaeological investigation has found evidence of irrigation in areas lacking sufficient natural rainfall to support crops for rainfed agriculture. Some of the earliest known use of the technology dates to the 6th millennium BCE in Khuzistan in the south-west of Iran. The site of Choga Mami, in present-day Iraq on the border with Iran, is believed to be the earliest to show the first canal irrigation in operation at about 6000 BCE.

Irrigation was used as a means of manipulation of water in the alluvial plains of the Indus valley civilization, the application of which is estimated to have begun around 4500 BCE and drastically increased the size and prosperity of their agricultural settlements. The Indus Valley Civilization developed sophisticated irrigation and water-storage systems, including artificial reservoirs at Girnar dated to 3000 BCE, and an early canal irrigation system from 2600 BCE. Large-scale agriculture was practiced, with an extensive network of canals used for the purpose of irrigation.

Farmers in the Mesopotamian plain used irrigation from at least the third-millennium BCE.
They developed &quot;perennial irrigation&quot;, regularly watering crops throughout the growing season by coaxing water through a matrix of small channels formed in the field.
Ancient Egyptians practiced &quot;basin irrigation&quot; using the flooding of the Nile to inundate land plots which had been surrounded by dikes. The flood water remained until the fertile sediment had settled before the engineers returned the surplus to the watercourse. There is evidence of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhet III in the twelfth dynasty (about 1800 BCE) using the natural lake of the Faiyum Oasis as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during dry seasons. The lake swelled annually from the flooding of the Nile.

The Ancient Nubians developed a form of irrigation by using a waterwheel-like device called a &quot;sakia&quot;. Irrigation began in Nubia between the third and second millennia BCE. It largely depended upon the flood waters that would flow through the Nile River and other rivers in what is now the Sudan.

In sub-Saharan Africa, irrigation reached the Niger River region cultures and civilizations by the first or second millennium BCE and was based on wet-season flooding and water harvesting.

Evidence of &quot;terrace irrigation&quot; occurs in pre-Columbian America, early Syria, India, and China. In the Zana Valley of the Andes Mountains in Peru, archaeologists have found remains of three irrigation canals radiocarbon-dated from the 4th millennium BCE, the 3rd millennium BCE and the 9th century CE. These canals provide the earliest record of irrigation in the New World. Traces of a canal possibly dating from the 5th millennium BCE were found under the 4th-millennium canal.

Ancient Persia (modern-day Iran) used irrigation as far back as the 6th millennium BCE to grow barley in areas with insufficient natural rainfall. The Qanats, developed in ancient Persia about 800 BCE, are among the oldest known irrigation methods still in use today. They are now found in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. The system comprises a network of vertical wells and gently sloping tunnels driven into the sides of cliffs and steep hills to tap groundwater. The noria, a water wheel with clay pots around the rim powered by the flow of the stream (or by animals where the water source was still), first came into use at about this time among Roman settlers in North Africa. By 150 BCE, the pots were fitted with valves to allow smoother filling as they were forced into the water.

====Sri Lanka====
The irrigation works of ancient Sri Lanka, the earliest dating from about 300 BCE in the reign of King Pandukabhaya, and under continuous development for the next thousand years, were one of the most complex irrigation systems of the ancient world. In addition to underground canals, the Sinhalese were the first to build completely artificial reservoirs to store water. These reservoirs and canal systems were used primarily to irrigate paddy fields, which require a lot of water to cultivate. Most of these irrigation systems still exist undamaged up to now, in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, because of the advanced and precise engineering. The system was extensively restored and further extended during the reign of King Parakrama Bahu (1153–1186 CE).

==== China ====

The oldest known hydraulic engineers of China were Sunshu Ao (6th century BCE) of the Spring and Autumn period and Ximen Bao (5th century BCE) of the Warring States period, both of whom worked on large irrigation projects. In the Sichuan region belonging to the state of Qin of ancient China, the Dujiangyan Irrigation System devised by the Qin Chinese hydrologist and irrigation engineer Li Bing was built in 256 BCE to irrigate a vast area of farmland that today still supplies water. By the 2nd century CE, during the Han dynasty, the Chinese also used chain pumps which lifted water from a lower elevation to a higher one. These were powered by manual foot-pedal, hydraulic waterwheels, or rotating mechanical wheels pulled by oxen. The water was used for public works, providing water for urban residential quarters and palace gardens, but mostly for irrigation of farmland canals and channels in the fields.

==== Korea ====
Korea, Jang Yeong-sil, a Korean engineer of the Joseon dynasty, under the active direction of the king, Sejong the Great, invented the world&#x27;s first rain gauge, &quot;uryanggye&quot; () in 1441. It was installed in irrigation tanks as part of a nationwide system to measure and collect rainfall for agricultural applications. Planners and farmers could better use the information gathered in the survey with this instrument.

==== North America ====
The earliest agricultural irrigation canal system known in the area of the present-day United States dates to between 1200 BCE and 800 BCE and was discovered by Desert Archaeology, Inc. in Marana, Arizona (adjacent to Tucson) in 2009. The irrigation-canal system predates the Hohokam culture by two thousand years and belongs to an unidentified culture. In North America, the Hohokam were the only culture known to rely on irrigation canals to water their crops, and their irrigation systems supported the largest population in the Southwest by CE 1300. The Hohokam constructed various simple canals combined with weirs in their various agricultural pursuits. Between the 7th and 14th centuries, they built and maintained extensive irrigation networks along the lower Salt and middle Gila Rivers that rivaled the complexity of those used in the ancient Near East, Egypt, and China. These were constructed using relatively simple excavation tools, without the benefit of advanced engineering technologies, and achieved drops of a few feet per mile, balancing erosion and siltation. The Hohokam cultivated cotton, tobacco, maize, beans, and squash varieties and harvested an assortment of wild plants. Late in the Hohokam Chronological Sequence, they used extensive dry-farming systems, primarily to grow agave for food and fiber. Their reliance on agricultural strategies based on canal irrigation, vital in their less-than-hospitable desert environment and arid climate, provided the basis for the aggregation of rural populations into stable urban centers.

====South America====
The oldest known irrigation canals in the Americas are in the desert of northern Peru in the Zaña Valley near the hamlet of Nanchoc. The canals have been radiocarbon dated to at least 3400 BCE and possibly as old as 4700 BCE. The canals at that time irrigated crops such as peanuts, squash, manioc, chenopods, a relative of Quinoa, and later maize.

===Modern history===
The scale of global irrigation increased dramatically over the 20th century. In 1800, 8 million hectares were irrigated; in 1950, 94 million hectares, and in 1990, 235 million hectares. By 1990, 30% of the global food production came from irrigated land. Irrigation techniques across the globe included canals redirecting surface water, groundwater pumping, and diverting water from dams. National governments led most irrigation schemes within their borders, but private investors and other nations, especially the United States, China, and European countries like the United Kingdom, funded and organized some schemes within other nations. Irrigation enabled the production of more crops, especially commodity crops in areas that otherwise could not support them. Countries frequently invested in irrigation to increase wheat, rice, or cotton production, often with the overarching goal of increasing self-sufficiency. In the 20th century, global anxiety, specifically about the American cotton monopoly, fueled many empirical irrigation projects: Britain began developing irrigation in India, the Ottomans in Egypt, the French in Algeria, the Portuguese in Angola, the Germans in Togo, and Soviets in Central Asia.

Negative impacts frequently accompany extensive irrigation. Some projects that diverted surface water for irrigation dried up the water sources, which led to a more extreme regional climate. Projects that relied on groundwater and pumped too much from underground aquifers created subsidence and salinization. Salinization of irrigation water damaged the crops and seeped into drinking water. Pests and pathogens also thrived in the irrigation canals or ponds full of still water, which created regional outbreaks of diseases like malaria and schistosomiasis. Governments also used irrigation schemes to encourage migration, especially of more desirable populations into an area. Additionally, some of these large nationwide schemes failed to pay off at all, costing more than any benefit gained from increased crop yields.

====American West====
Irrigated land in the United States increased from 300,000 acres in 1880 to 4.1 million in 1890 to 7.3 million in 1900. Two thirds of this irrigation sources from groundwater or small ponds and reservoirs, while the other one third comes from large dams. One of the main attractions of irrigation in the West was its increased dependability compared to rainfall-watered agriculture in the East. Proponents argued that farmers with a dependable water supply could more easily get loans from bankers interested in this more predictable farming model. Most irrigation in the Great Plains region derived from underground aquifers. Euro-American farmers who colonized the region in the 19th century tried to grow the commodity crops that they were used to, like wheat, corn, and alfalfa, but rainfall stifled their growing capacity. Between the late 1800s and the 1930s, farmers used wind-powered pumps to draw groundwater. These windpumps had limited power, but the development of gas-powered pumps in the mid-1930s pushed wells deep into the Ogallala Aquifer. Farmers irrigated fields by laying pipes across the field with sprinklers at intervals, a labor-intensive process, until the advent of the center-pivot sprinkler after World War II, which made irrigation significantly easier. By the 1970s farmers drained the aquifer ten times faster than it could recharge, and by 1993 they had removed half of the accessible water.

Large-scale federal funding and intervention pushed through the majority of irrigation projects in the West, especially in California, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada. At first, plans to increase irrigated farmland, largely by giving land to farmers and asking them to find water, failed across the board. Congress passed the Desert Land Act in 1877 and the Carey Act in 1894, which only marginally increased irrigation. Only in 1902 did Congress pass the National Reclamation Act, which channeled money from the sale of western public lands, in parcels up to 160 acres large, into irrigation projects on public or private land in the arid West. The Congressmen who passed the law and their wealthy supporters supported Western irrigation because it would increase American exports, &#x27;reclaim&#x27; the West, and push the Eastern poor out West for a better life.

While the National Reclamation Act was the most successful piece of federal irrigation legislation, the implementation of the act did not go as planned. The Reclamation Service chose to push most of the Act&#x27;s money toward construction rather than settlement, so the Service overwhelmingly prioritized building large dams like the Hoover Dam. Over the 20th century, Congress and state governments grew more frustrated with the Reclamation Service and the irrigation schemes. Frederick Newell, head of the Reclamation Service, proving uncompromising and challenging to work with, falling crop prices, resistance to delay debt payments, and refusal to begin new projects until the completion of old ones all contributed. The Reclamation Extension Act of 1914, transferring a significant amount of irrigation decision-making power regarding irrigation projects from the Reclamation Service to Congress, was in many ways a result of increasing political unpopularity of the Reclamation Service.

In the lower Colorado Basin of Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada, the states derive irrigation water largely from rivers, especially the Colorado River, which irrigates more than 4.5 million acres of land, with a less significant amount coming from groundwater. In the 1952 case Arizona v. California, Arizona sued California for increased access to the Colorado River, under the grounds that their groundwater supply could not sustain their almost entirely irrigation-based agricultural economy, which they won. California, which began irrigating in earnest in the 1870s in San Joaquin Valley, had passed the Wright Act of 1887 permitting agricultural communities to construct and operate needed irrigation works. The Colorado River also irrigates large fields in California&#x27;s Imperial Valley, fed by the National Reclamation Act-built All-American Canal.

====Soviet Central Asia====
When the Bolsheviks conquered Central Asia in 1917, the native Kazakhs, Uzbeks, and Turkmens used minimal irrigation. The Slavic immigrants pushed into the area by the Tsarist government brought their irrigation methods, including waterwheels, the use of rice paddies to restore salted land, and underground irrigation channels. Russians dismissed these techniques as crude and inefficient. Despite this, tsarist officials maintained these systems through the late 19th century without other solutions.

Before conquering the area, the Russian government accepted a 1911 American proposal to send hydraulic experts to Central Asia to investigate the potential for large-scale irrigation. A 1918 decree by Lenin then encouraged irrigation development in the region, which began in the 1930s. When it did, Stalin and other Soviet leaders prioritized large-scale, ambitious hydraulic projects, especially along the Volga River. The Soviet irrigation push stemmed mainly from their late 19th century fears of the American cotton monopoly and subsequent desire to achieve cotton self-sufficiency. They had built up their textile manufacturing industry in the 19th century, requiring increased cotton and irrigation, as the region did not receive enough rainfall to support cotton farming.

The Russians built dams on the Don and Kuban Rivers for irrigation, removing freshwater flow from the Sea of Azov and making it much saltier. Depletion and salinization scourged other areas of the Russian irrigation project. In the 1950s, Soviet officials began also diverting the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya, which fed the Aral Sea. Before diversion, the rivers delivered of water to the Aral Sea per year, but after, they only delivered . Because of its reduced inflow, the Aral Sea covered less than half of its original seabed, which made the regional climate more extreme and created airborne salinization, lowering nearby crop yields.

By 1975, the USSR used eight times as much water as they had in 1913, mostly for irrigation. Russia&#x27;s expansion of irrigation began to decrease in the late 1980s, and irrigated hectares in Central Asia capped out at 7 million. Mikhail Gorbachev killed a proposed plan to reverse the Ob and Yenisei for irrigation in 1986, and the breakup of the USSR in 1991 ended Russian investment in Central Asian cotton irrigation.

====Africa====
Different irrigation schemes with various goals and success rates have been implemented across Africa in the 20th century but have all been influenced by colonial forces. The Tana River Irrigation Scheme in eastern Kenya, completed between 1948 and 1963, opened up new lands for agriculture. The Kenyan government attempted to resettle the area with detainees from the Mau Mau uprising. Italian oil drillers discovered Libya&#x27;s underground water resources during the Italian colonization of Libya. This water lay dormant until 1969, when Muammar al-Gaddafi and American Armand Hammer built the Great Man-Made River to deliver the Saharan water to the coast. The water largely contributed to irrigation but cost four to ten times more than the crops it produced were worth.

In 1912, the Union of South Africa created an irrigation department and began investing in water storage infrastructure and irrigation. The government used irrigation and dam-building to further social goals like poverty relief by creating construction jobs for poor whites and irrigation schemes to increase white farming. One of their first significant irrigation projects was the Hartbeespoort Dam, begun in 1916 to elevate the living conditions of the &#x27;poor whites&#x27; in the region and eventually completed as a &#x27;whites only&#x27; employment opportunity. The Pretoria irrigation scheme, Kammanassie project, and Buchuberg irrigation scheme on the Orange River all followed in the same vein in the 1920s and 30s.

In Egypt, modern irrigation began with Muhammad Ali Pasha in the mid-1800s, who sought to achieve Egyptian independence from the Ottomans through increased trade with Europe—specifically cotton exportation. His administration proposed replacing the traditional Nile basin irrigation, which took advantage of the annual ebb and flow of the Nile, with irrigation barrages in the lower Nile, which better suited cotton production. Egypt devoted 105,000 ha to cotton in 1861, which increased fivefold by 1865. Most of their exports were shipped to England, and the United States Civil War-induced cotton scarcity in the 1860s cemented Egypt as England&#x27;s cotton producer. As the Egyptian economy became more dependent on cotton in the 20th century, controlling even small Nile floods became more important. Cotton production was more at risk of destruction than more common crops like barley or wheat. After the British occupation of Egypt in 1882, the British intensified the conversion to perennial irrigation with the construction of the Delta Barrage, the Assiut Barrage, and the first Aswan Dam. Perennial irrigation decreased local control over water and made traditional subsistence farming or the farming of other crops incredibly difficult, eventually contributing to widespread peasant bankruptcy and the 1879-1882 &#x27;Urabi revolt.

<doc id="42266" wikidata="Q1276395" url="?curid=42266" title="Victor Davis Hanson">
<text>Victor Davis Hanson (born September 5, 1953) is an American classicist, military historian, and conservative political commentator. He has been a commentator on modern and ancient warfare and contemporary politics for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, and other media outlets. 

He is a professor emeritus of classics at California State University, Fresno, the Martin and Illie Anderson Senior Fellow in classics and military history at the Hoover Institution, and visiting professor at Hillsdale College. Hanson was awarded the National Humanities Medal in 2007 by President George W. Bush and was a presidential appointee in 2007–2008 on the American Battle Monuments Commission.

==Early life and education==
Hanson grew up in Selma, California, in the San Joaquin Valley, and has worked there most of his life. 

He is of Swedish and Welsh ancestry, and his father&#x27;s cousin, for whom he was named, was killed in the Battle of Okinawa.

Hanson received a B.A. in classics and general Cowell College honors from the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 1975 and his PhD in classics from Stanford University in 1980.

==Academic career: 1985–2004==

Hanson notes autobiographically that he was &quot;a full-time orchard and vineyard grower from 1980-1984, before joining the nearby CSU&quot; (California State University, Fresno) in 1984, to launch a classical studies program there. In 1991, Hanson was awarded the American Philological Association&#x27;s Excellence in Teaching Award, given annually to the nation&#x27;s top undergraduate teachers of Greek and Latin. He was named distinguished alumnus of the year for 2006 at University of California, Santa Cruz. He has been a visiting professor of classics at Stanford University in California (1991–1992) and a National Endowment for the Humanities fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, California (1992–1993). He was named a Alexander Onassis Fellow (2001), and a Nimitz Fellow at University of California, Berkeley (2006), and held the visiting Shifrin Chair of Military History at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland (2002–2003).

In 2004, he took early retirement to focus on his political writing and popular history. Hanson has held a series of positions in conservative-leaning institutions and private foundations. He was appointed Fellow in California Studies at the Claremont Institute, a conservative think-tank in California, in 2002. 

Hanson was appointed as a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford, California, another conservative think-tank. He served as a William Simon Visiting Professor at the School of Public Policy at Pepperdine University, a private Christian institution in California, from 2009–2015, and was awarded in 2015 an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the graduate school at Pepperdine. He gave the Wriston Lecture in 2004 for the Manhattan Institute whose mission is to &quot;develop and disseminate new ideas that foster greater economic choice and individual responsibility.&quot; He became a board member of the Bradley Foundation in 2015 and served on the HF Guggenheim Foundation board for over a decade.

==Writing==

Since 2004, Hanson has written a weekly column syndicated by Tribune Content Agency, as well as a weekly column for &quot;National Review Online&quot; since 2001. He was awarded the National Humanities Medal (2007) by President George W. Bush, as well as the Eric Breindel Prize for opinion journalism (2002), and the Bradley Prize from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in 2008.

Hanson&#x27;s &quot;Warfare and Agriculture&quot; (Giardini 1983), his PhD thesis, argued that Greek warfare could not be understood apart from agrarian life in general and suggested that the modern assumption that agriculture was irrevocably harmed during classical wars was vastly overestimated. &quot;The Western Way of War&quot; (Alfred Knopf 1989) explored the combatants&#x27; experiences of ancient Greek battle and detailed the Hellenic foundations of later Western military practice.

&quot;The Other Greeks&quot; (The Free Press 1995) argued that the emergence of a unique middling agrarian class explains the ascendance of the Greek city-state and its singular values of consensual government, sanctity of private property, civic militarism, and individualism. In &quot;Fields Without Dreams&quot; (The Free Press 1996, winner of the Bay Area Book Reviewers Award) and &quot;The Land Was Everything&quot; (The Free Press 2000, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; notable book of the year), Hanson lamented the decline of family farming and rural communities and the loss of agrarian voices in American democracy. &quot;The Soul of Battle&quot; (The Free Press 1999) traced the careers of Epaminondas, the Theban liberator, William Tecumseh Sherman, and George S. Patton in arguing that democratic warfare&#x27;s strengths are best illustrated in short, intense, and spirited marches to promote consensual rule but bog down otherwise during long occupations or more conventional static battle.

In &quot;Mexifornia&quot; (Encounter 2003), a personal memoir about growing up in rural California and an account of immigration from Mexico, Hanson predicted that illegal immigration would soon reach crisis proportions unless legal, measured, and diverse immigration was restored, as well as the traditional melting-pot values of integration, assimilation, and intermarriage.

&quot;Ripples of Battle&quot; (Doubleday 2003) chronicled how the cauldron of battle affects combatants&#x27; later literary and artistic work, as its larger influence ripples for generations, affecting art, literature, culture, and government. In &quot;A War Like No Other&quot; (Random House 2005, a &quot;New York Times&quot; notable book of the year), a history of the Peloponnesian War, Hanson offered an alternative history, arranged by methods of fighting (triremes, hoplites, cavalry, sieges, etc.) in concluding that the conflict marked a brutal watershed event for the Greek city-states. &quot;The Savior Generals&quot; (Bloomsbury 2013) followed the careers of five great generals (Themistocles, Belisarius, Sherman, Ridgway, Petraeus) and argued that rare qualities in leadership emerge during hopeless predicaments that only rare individuals can salvage.

&quot;The End of Sparta&quot; (Bloomsbury 2011) is a novel about a small community of Thespian farmers who join the great march of Epaminondas (369/370 BC) to the heart of the Peloponnese to destroy Spartan hegemony, free the Messenian helots, and spread democracy in the Peloponnese.

Hanson has edited several collections of essays, including (&quot;Hoplites&quot;, Routledge 1991), &quot;Bonfire of the Humanities&quot; (with B. Thornton and J. Heath, ISI 2001), and &quot;Makers of Ancient Strategy&quot; (Princeton 2010), as well as a number of his own collected articles, such as &quot;An Autumn of War&quot; [2002 Anchor], &quot;Between War and Peace&quot; [Anchor 2004], and &quot;The Father of Us All&quot; [Bloomsbury 2010]. He has written chapters for works such as the &quot;Cambridge History of War&quot;, and the &quot;Cambridge History of Ancient Warfare&quot;.

===&quot;Carnage and Culture&quot;===

Hanson wrote the 2001 book &quot;Carnage and Culture&quot; (Doubleday), published in Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries as &quot;Why the West Has Won&quot;, in which he argued that the military dominance of Western civilization, beginning with the ancient Greeks, results from certain fundamental aspects of Western culture, such as consensual government, a tradition of self-critique, secular rationalism, religious tolerance, individual freedom, free expression, free markets, and individualism. Hanson&#x27;s emphasis on cultural exception rejects racial explanations for Western military preeminence and disagrees with the environmental or geographical determinist explanations such as those put forth by Jared Diamond in &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; (1997).

The American military officer Robert L. Bateman, in a 2007 article on the Media Matters for America website, criticized Hanson&#x27;s thesis and argued that Hanson&#x27;s point about Western armies preferring to seek out a decisive battle of annihilation is rebutted by the Second Punic War in which Roman attempts to annihilate the Carthaginians instead led to the Carthaginians annihilating the Romans at the Battle of Cannae. Bateman argued that Hanson was wrong about Western armies&#x27; common preferences in seeking out a battle of annihilation and argued that the Romans defeated the Carthaginians only via the Fabian strategy of keeping their armies in being and not engaging Hannibal in battle. In a response published on his personal website, Hanson argued that Bateman had misunderstood and misrepresented his thesis. Hanson stated that in the Second Punic War, the Romans initially sought out decisive battles but were reluctantly forced to resort to a Fabian strategy after several defeats at the hands of a tactical genius until they had rebuilt their military capacity, when they ultimately defeated Hannibal in decisive battles. He also said that since the Carthaginians themselves had adopted many &quot;Western&quot; methods of warfare from the Greeks, Hannibal, too, was keen to seek decisive battles.

===United States education and classical studies===
Hanson co-authored the book &quot;Who Killed Homer? The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom&quot; with John Heath in 1998. The book explores the issue of how classical education has declined in the US and what might be done to restore it to its former prominence. That is important, according to Hanson and Heath, because knowledge of classical Greece and Rome is necessary for a full understanding of Western culture. To begin a discussion along those lines, the authors state, &quot;The answer to why the world is becoming Westernized goes all the way back to the wisdom of the Greeks—reason enough why we must not abandon the study of our heritage.&quot;

The political scientist Francis Fukuyama reviewed &quot;Who Killed Homer?&quot; favorably in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; and wrote that, &quot;The great thinkers of the Western tradition—from Hobbes, Burke, and Hegel to Weber and Nietzsche (who was trained as a classical philologist)—were so thoroughly steeped in Greek thought that they scarcely needed to refer back to original texts for quotations. This tradition has come under fire from two camps, one postmodernist that seeks to deconstruct the classics on the grounds of gender, race, and class, and the other pragmatic and career-minded that asks what value the classics have in a computer-driven society. The authors&#x27; defense of a traditionalist approach to the classics is worthy.&quot;

The classicists Victoria Cech and Joy Connolly found &quot;Who Killed Homer?&quot; to have considerable pitfalls. Reviews of the book have noted several problems with the authors&#x27; perception of classical culture. According to Cech, &quot;One example is the relation of the individual to the state and the &#x27;freedom&#x27; of belief or of inquiry in each. Socrates and Jesus were put to death by their respective states for articulating inconvenient doctrines. In Sparta, where the population of citizens (male) were carefully socialized in a military system, no one seems to have differed from the majority enough to merit the death penalty. But these differences are not sorted out by the authors, for &quot;their mission is to build an ideal structure of classical attitudes by which to reveal our comparative flaws&quot;, and their point is more what is wrong with us than what was right with Athens. I contend that Hanson and Heath are actually comparing modern academia not to the ancient seminal cultures but to the myth that arose about them over the last couple of millennia.&quot; According to Connolly, Professor of Classics at New York University as of 2016, &quot;Throughout history, the authors say, women have never enjoyed equal rights and responsibilities. At least in Greece, &#x27;the veiled, mutilated, and secluded were not the norm&#x27; (p. 57). Why waste time, then, as feminist scholarship does, &#x27;merely demarcating the exact nature of the sexism of the Greeks and the West&#x27; (p. 102)? From their point of view, in fact, the real legacy of feminism is the destruction of the values of family and community.&quot;

==Political views==
Hanson was at one time a registered member of the Democratic Party but is a conservative who voted for George W. Bush in the 2000 and 2004 elections. As of 2020, he is a registered independent. He defended George W. Bush and his policies, especially the Iraq War. He vocally supported Bush&#x27;s Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, describing him as &quot;a rare sort of secretary of the caliber of George Marshall&quot; and a &quot;proud and honest-speaking visionary&quot; whose &quot;hard work and insight are bringing us ever closer to victory&quot;.

Hanson, a supporter of Donald Trump, wrote a 2019 book called &quot;The Case for Trump&quot;. Trump praised the book, in which Hanson defends Trump&#x27;s insults and incendiary language as &quot;uncouth authenticity&quot;, and praises Trump for &quot;an uncanny ability to troll and create hysteria among his media and political critics.&quot;

He has been described as a conservative by some commentators for his views on the Iraq War and stated, &quot;I came to support neocon approaches first in the wars against the Taliban and Saddam, largely because I saw little alternative.&quot; Hanson&#x27;s 2002 &quot;An Autumn of War&quot; called for going to war &quot;hard, long, without guilt, apology or respite until our enemies are no more.&quot; In the context of the Iraq War, Hanson wrote, &quot;In an era of the greatest affluence and security in the history of civilization, the real question before us remains whether the United Statesindeed any Western democracystill possesses the moral clarity to identify evil as evil, and then the uncontested will to marshal every available resource to fight and eradicate it.&quot;

===Race relations===
In July 2013, Attorney General Eric Holder gave a speech where he mentioned that as a black man, he needed to deliver &quot;the Talk&quot; to his son to instruct him on how to interact with police as a young black man. In response to Holder&#x27;s speech, Hanson wrote a column, &quot;Facing Facts about Race&quot;, in which he offered his own version of &quot;the Talk&quot;, the need to inform his children to be careful of young black men when venturing into the inner city, who Hanson argued were statistically more likely to commit violent crimes than young men of other races, and so it was understandable for the police to focus on them. Ta-Nehisi Coates of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described Hanson&#x27;s column as &quot;stupid advice&quot;: &quot;in any other context we would automatically recognize this &#x27;talk&#x27; as stupid advice. If I were to tell you that I only employ Asian-Americans to do my taxes because &#x27;Asian-Americans do better on the Math SAT&#x27;, you would not simply question my sensitivity, but my mental faculties.&quot;

Arthur Stern called &quot;Facing Facts About Race&quot; an &quot;inflammatory&quot; column based upon crime statistics that Hanson had never cited: &quot;His presentation of this controversial opinion as undeniable fact without exhaustive statistical proof is undeniably racist.&quot; The journalist Kelefa Sanneh, in response to &quot;Facing Facts About Race&quot;, wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s strange, then, to read Hanson writing as if the fear of violent crime were mainly a &quot;white or Asian&quot; problem, about which African-Americans might be uninformed, or unconcernedas if African-American parents weren&#x27;t already giving their children more detailed and nuanced versions of Hanson&#x27;s &#x27;sermon&#x27;, sharing his earnest and absurd hope that the right words might keep trouble at bay.&quot; Hanson, in response to Sanneh&#x27;s essay, accused him of a &quot;McCarthyite character assassination&quot; and &quot;infantile, if not racialist, logic.&quot;

===Obama criticism===
Hanson was a critic of President Barack Obama. He criticized the Obama administration for what he saw as &quot;appeasing&quot; Iran and Russia, and blamed Obama for the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in 2014. In May 2016, Hanson argued that Obama failed to maintain a credible threat of deterrence and that &quot;the next few months may prove the most dangerous since World War II.&quot;

== Personal life ==
On June 18, 1977, Hanson married Cara Webb. They had three children— two daughters and a son. The couple divorced in 2005. In 2013, Hanson married Jennifer Heyne. In 2014, Hanson&#x27;s youngest daughter, Susannah, died of leukemia.

Hanson&#x27;s mother, sister-in-law and maternal aunt have also died of cancer.

Hanson currently resides on a farm outside of Selma in California&#x27;s Central Valley, which has been in his family since the 1870s.

<text>Cost accounting is defined by the Institute of Management Accountants as &quot;a systematic set of procedures for recording and reporting measurements of the cost of manufacturing goods and performing services in the aggregate and in detail. It includes methods for recognizing, allocating, aggregating and reporting such costs and comparing them with standard costs&quot;. Often considered a subset of managerial accounting, its end goal is to advise the management on how to optimize business practices and processes based on cost efficiency and capability. Cost accounting provides the detailed cost information that management needs to control current operations and plan for the future.

Cost accounting information is also commonly used in financial accounting, but its primary function is for use by managers to facilitate their decision-making.

==Origins of cost accounting ==
All types of businesses, whether manufacturing, trading or producing services, require cost accounting to track their activities. Cost accounting has long been used to help managers understand the costs of running a business. Modern cost accounting originated during the Industrial Revolution when the complexities of running large scale businesses led to the development of systems for recording and tracking costs to help business owners and managers make decisions. Various techniques used by cost accountants include standard costing and variance analysis, marginal costing and cost volume profit analysis, budgetary control, uniform costing, inter firm comparison, etc. Evaluation of cost accounting is mainly due to the limitations of financial accounting. Moreover, maintenance of cost records has been made compulsory in selected industries as notified by the government from time to time. 

In the early industrial age most of the costs incurred by a business were what modern accountants call &quot;variable costs&quot; because they varied directly with the amount of production. Money was spent on labour, raw materials, the power to run a factory, etc., in direct proportion to production. Managers could simply total the variable costs for a product and use this as a rough guide for decision-making processes.

Some costs tend to remain the same even during busy periods, unlike variable costs, which rise and fall with volume of work. Over time, these &quot;fixed costs&quot; have become more important to managers. Examples of fixed costs include the depreciation of plant and equipment, and the cost of departments such as maintenance, tooling, production control, purchasing, quality control, storage and handling, plant supervision and engineering.

In the early nineteenth century, these costs were of little importance to most businesses. However, with the growth of railroads, steel and large scale manufacturing, by the late nineteenth century these costs were often more important than the variable cost of a product, and allocating them to a broad range of products led to bad decision making. Managers must understand fixed costs in order to make decisions about products and pricing.

For example: A company produced railway coaches and had only one product. To make each coach, the company needed to purchase $60 of raw materials and components and pay 6 labourers $40 each. Therefore, the total variable cost for each coach was $300. Knowing that making a coach required spending $300, managers knew they could not sell below that price without losing money on each coach. Any price above $300 would make a contribution to the fixed costs of the company. If the fixed costs were, say, $1000 per month for rent, insurance and owner&#x27;s salary, the company could therefore sell 5 coaches per month for a total of $3000 (priced at $600 each), or 10 coaches for a total of $4500 (priced at $450 each), and make a profit of $500 in each case.

== Cost accounting vs financial accounting==

== Cost accounting methods ==
The following are some of the different cost accounting approaches:
==Elements of cost accounting ==

Basic cost elements are:
# Material
# Labour
# Expenses and other overheads

=== Material (inventory) ===
The materials directly contributed to a product and those easily identifiable in the finished product are called direct materials. For example, paper in books, wood in furniture, plastic in a water tank, and leather in shoes are direct materials. Other, usually lower cost items or supporting material used in the production of in a finished product are called indirect materials. For example, the length of thread used in a garment.

Furthermore, these can be categorized into three different types of inventories that must be accounted for in different ways; raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods.

=== Labour ===
Any wages paid to workers or a group of workers which may directly co-relate to any specific activity of production, maintenance, transportation of material, or product, and directly associate in the conversion of raw material into finished goods are called direct labour. Wages paid to trainees or apprentices does not come under the category of direct labour as they have no significant value.

=== Overheads ===
Overheads include:

* Production or works overhead including factory staff
* Administration overhead including office staff
* Sales overhead including production and maintenance of catalogues, advertising (development and purchases), exhibitions, sales staff, cost of money
* Distribution overhead
* Maintenance and repair including office equipment and factory machinery
* Supplies
* Utilities including gas, electric, water, sewer, and municipal assessments
* Other variable expenses
* Salaries/payroll including wages, pensions, and paycheck deductions (e.g., National Insurance and PAYE in the UK, FICA in the US)
*Occupancy (rent, mortgage, property taxes)
* Depreciation (durable goods including machinery and office equipment)
* Other fixed expenses

These categories are flexible, sometimes overlapping as different cost accounting principles are applied.

==Classification of costs==
Important classifications of costs include:
# By nature or traceability: Direct costs and indirect costs. Direct costs are directly attributable/traceable to cost objects, while indirect costs (not being directly attributable) are allocated or apportioned to cost objects.
# By function: production, administration, selling and distribution, or research and development.
# By behavior: fixed, variable, or semi-variable. Fixed costs remain unchanged irrespective of changes in the production volume over a given period of time. Variable costs change according to the volume of production. Semi-variable costs are partly fixed and partly variable.
# By controllability: Controllable costs are those which can be controlled or influenced by conscious management action. Uncontrollable costs cannot be controlled or influenced by conscious management action.
# By normality: normal costs and abnormal costs. Normal costs arise during routine day-to-day business operations. Abnormal costs arise because of any abnormal activity or event not part of routine business operations, such as accidents or natural disasters.
# By time: Historical costs and predetermined costs. Historical costs are costs incurred in the past. Predetermined costs are computed in advance on basis of factors affecting cost elements.
# By decision-making costs: These costs are used for managerial decision making: 
##Marginal costs: The marginal cost is the change in the total cost caused by increasing or decreasing output by one unit.
##Differential costs: This cost is the difference in total cost resulting from selecting one alternative over another.
##Opportunity costs: The value of a benefit sacrificed in favour of an alternative course of action.
##Relevant cost: The relevant cost is a cost which is relevant in various decisions of management.
##Replacement cost: This cost is the cost at which existing items of material or fixed assets can be replaced at present or at a future date.
##Shutdown cost: Costs incurred if operations are shut down, and which would not occur if operations are continued.
##Capacity cost: The cost incurred by a company for providing production, administration and selling and distribution capabilities in order to perform various functions. These costs are normally fixed costs.
##Sunk cost: A cost already incurred, which cannot be recovered.
##Other costs

==Standard cost accounting==
Standard Costing is a technique of Cost Accounting to compare the actual costs with standard costs (that are pre-defined) with the help of Variance Analysis. It is used to understand the variations of product costs in manufacturing. Standard costing allocates fixed costs incurred in an accounting period to the goods produced during that period. This allowed the &quot;full cost&quot; of products that were not sold in the period they were produced to be recorded as &#x27;inventory&#x27; in the Balance sheet to be carried forward to the next accounting period, using a variety of complex accounting methods, which was consistent with the principles of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). It also essentially enabled managers to ignore the fixed costs, and look at the results of each period in relation to the &quot;standard cost&quot; for any given product.

:For Example: if the railway coach company normally produced 40 coaches per month, and the fixed costs were still $1000/month, then each coach could be said to incur an Operating Cost/overhead of $25 =($1000 / 40). Adding this to the variable costs of $300 per coach produced a full cost of $325 per coach.

This method tended to slightly distort the resulting unit cost, but in mass-production industries that made one product line, and where the fixed costs were relatively low, the distortion was very minor.

:For Example: if the railway coach company made 100 coaches one month, then the unit cost would become $310 per coach ($300 + ($1000 / 100)). If the next month the company made 50 coaches, then the unit cost = $320 per coach ($300 + ($1000 / 50)), a relatively minor difference.

An important part of standard cost accounting is a variance analysis, which breaks down the variation between actual cost and standard costs into various components (volume variation, material cost variation, labor cost variation, etc.) so managers can understand &quot;why costs were different from what was planned&quot; and take appropriate action to correct the situation.

==The development of throughput accounting==
As business became more complex and began producing a greater variety of products, the use of cost accounting to make decisions to maximize profitability came into question. Management circles became increasingly aware of the Theory of Constraints in the 1980s and began to understand that &quot;every production process has a limiting factor&quot; somewhere in the chain of production. As business management learned to identify the constraints, they increasingly adopted throughput accounting to manage them and &quot;maximize the &quot;throughput dollars&quot;&quot; (or other currency) from each unit of constrained resource.

Throughput accounting aims to make the best use of scarce resources (bottleneck) in a JIT (Just in time) environment.

&quot;Throughput&quot;, in this context, refers to the amount of money obtained from sales minus the cost of materials that have gone into making them.

=== Mathematical formulae===

:formula_1
:formula_2

==Activity-based costing==

Activity-based costing (ABC) is a system for assigning costs to products based on the activities they require. In this case, activities are those regular actions performed inside a company. &quot;Talking with the customer regarding invoice questions&quot; is an example of activity inside most companies.

Companies may be moved to adopt ABC by a need to improve costing accuracy, that is, understand better the true costs and profitability of individual products, services, or initiatives. ABC gets closer to true costs in these areas by turning many costs that standard cost accounting views as indirect costs essentially into direct costs. By contrast, standard cost accounting typically determines so-called indirect and overhead costs simply as a percentage of certain direct costs, which may or may not reflect actual resource usage for individual items.

Under ABC, accountants assign 100% of each employee&#x27;s time to the different activities performed inside a company (many will use surveys to have the workers themselves assign their time to the different activities). The accountant then can determine the total cost spent on each activity by summing up the percentage of each worker&#x27;s salary spent on that activity.

A company can use the resulting activity cost data to determine where to focus its operational improvements. For example, a job-based manufacturer may find that a high percentage of its workers are spending their time trying to figure out a hastily written customer order. Via (ABC) Activity-based costing, the accountants now have a currency amount pegged to the activity of &quot;Researching Customer Work Order Specifications&quot;. Senior management can now decide how much focus or money to budget for resolving this process deficiency. Activity-based management includes (but is not restricted to) the use of activity-based costing to manage a business.

While (ABC) Activity-based costing may be able to pinpoint the cost of each activity and resources into the ultimate product, the process could be tedious, costly and subject to errors.

As it is a tool for a more accurate way of allocating fixed costs into a product, these fixed costs do not vary according to each month&#x27;s production volume. For example, the elimination of one product would not eliminate the overhead or even direct labour cost assigned to it. Activity-based costing (ABC) better identifies product costing in the long run, but may not be too helpful in day-to-day decision-making.

== Integrating EVA and process-based costing ==
Recently, Mocciaro Li Destri, Picone and Minà (2012) proposed a performance and cost measurement system that integrates the Economic Value Added criteria with Process-Based Costing (PBC). The EVA-PBC methodology allows us to implement the EVA management logic not only at the firm level, but also at lower levels of the organization. EVA-PBC methodology plays an interesting role in bringing strategy back into financial performance measures.

==Lean accounting==
Lean accounting has developed in recent years to provide the accounting, control, and measurement methods supporting lean manufacturing and other applications of lean thinking such as healthcare, construction, insurance, banking, education, government and other industries.

There are two main thrusts for Lean Accounting. The first is the application of lean methods to the company&#x27;s accounting, control, and measurement processes. This is not different from applying lean methods to any other processes. The objective is to eliminate waste, free up capacity, speed up the process, eliminate errors &amp; defects, and make the process clear and understandable. The second (and more important) thrust of Lean Accounting is to fundamentally change the accounting, control, and measurement processes so they motivate lean change &amp; improvement, provide information that is suitable for control and decision-making, provide an understanding of customer value, correctly assess the financial impact of lean improvement, and are themselves simple, visual, and low-waste. Lean Accounting does not require the traditional management accounting methods like standard costing, activity-based costing, variance reporting, cost-plus pricing, complex transactional control systems, and untimely and confusing financial reports. These are replaced by:
* lean-focused performance measurements
* simple summary direct costing of the value streams
* decision-making and reporting using a &quot;box score&quot;
* financial reports that are timely and presented in &quot;plain English&quot; that everyone can understand.
* radical simplification and elimination of transactional control systems by eliminating the need for them.
* driving lean changes from a deep understanding of the value created for the customers.
* eliminating traditional budgeting through monthly sales, operations, and financial planning processes (SOFP)
* value-based pricing
* correct understanding of the financial impact of lean change

As an organization becomes more mature with lean thinking and methods, they recognize that the combined methods of lean accounting in fact creates a lean management system (LMS) designed to provide the planning, the operational and financial reporting, and the motivation for change required to prosper the company&#x27;s on-going lean transformation.

==Marginal costing==
The cost-volume-profit analysis is the systematic examination of the relationship between selling prices, sales, production volumes, costs, expenses and profits. This analysis provides very useful information for decision-making in the management of a company. For example, the analysis can be used in establishing sales prices, in the product mix selection to sell, in the decision to choose marketing strategies, and in the analysis of the impact on profits by changes in costs. In the current environment of business, a business administration must act and take decisions in a fast and accurate manner. As a result, the importance of cost-volume-profit is still increasing as time passes.

&quot;CONTRIBUTION MARGIN&quot;

A relationship between the cost, volume and profit is the contribution margin. The contribution margin is the revenue excess from sales over variable costs. The concept of contribution margin is particularly useful in the planning of business because it gives an insight into the potential profits that a business can generate. The following chart shows the income statement of a company X, which has been prepared to show its contribution margin:

&quot;CONTRIBUTION MARGIN RATIO&quot;

The contribution margin can also be expressed as a percentage. The contribution margin ratio, which is sometimes called the profit-volume ratio, indicates the percentage of each sales dollar available to cover fixed costs and to provide operating revenue. For the company Fusion, Inc. the contribution margin ratio is 40%, which is computed as follows:

:formula_3

The contribution margin ratio measures the effect on operating income of an increase or a decrease in sales volume. For example, assume that the management of Fusion, Inc. is studying the effect of adding $80,000 in sales orders. Multiplying the contribution margin ratio (40%) by the change in sales volume ($80,000) indicates that operating income will increase $32,000 if additional orders are obtained. To validate this analysis the table below shows the income statement of the company including additional orders:

Variable costs as a percentage of sales are equal to 100% minus the contribution margin ratio. Thus, in the above income statement, the variable costs are 60% (100% - 40%) of sales, or $648,000 ($1,080,000 X 60%). The total contribution margin $432,000, can also be computed directly by multiplying the sales by the contribution margin ratio ($1,080,000 X 40%).

==Government procurement==
The United States&#x27; federal procurement rules (the Federal Acquisition Regulation, FAR) require government Contracting Officers negotiating contract prices to verify that suppliers&#x27; cost submissions are in accordance with the government&#x27;s contract cost principles and procedures and, in certain cases, the requirements and procedures of the federal Cost Accounting Standards. Relevant cost data or pricing data may be required from the supplier, in order to undertake a &quot;cost realism analysis&quot;, also known as a &quot;price realism analysis&quot;. FAR defines a cost realism analysis as Similarly, where a government agency requests a fixed price submission, provision may be made for a cost or price realism analysis to take place during the evaluation process.

<text>In management accounting or managerial accounting, managers use accounting information in decision-making and to assist in the management and performance of their control functions.

==Definition==

One simple definition of management accounting is the provision of financial and non-financial decision-making information to managers. In other words, management accounting helps the directors inside an organization to make decisions. This can also be known as Cost Accounting. This is the way toward distinguishing, examining, deciphering and imparting data to supervisors to help accomplish business goals. The information gathered includes all fields of accounting that educates the administration regarding business tasks identifying with the financial expenses and decisions made by the organization. Accountants use plans to measure the overall strategy of operations within the organization.

According to the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), &quot;Management accounting is a profession that involves partnering in management decision making, devising planning and performance management systems, and providing expertise in financial reporting and control to assist management in the formulation and implementation of an organization&#x27;s strategy&quot;.

Management accountants (also called managerial accountants) look at the events that happen in and around a business while considering the needs of the business. From this, data and estimates emerge. Cost accounting is the process of translating these estimates and data into knowledge that will ultimately be used to guide decision-making.

The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) being the largest management accounting institute with over 100,000 members describes Management accounting as analysing information to advise business strategy and drive sustainable business success.

The Institute of Certified Management Accountants (ICMA) has over 15,000 qualified professionals worldwide, with members in 50-countries. Its CMA postgraduate education program now is firmly established in 19 overseas markets, namely Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Cyprus, Dubai, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Nepal, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines; Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. 

To facilitate its educational objectives, the Institute has accredited a number of universities which have master&#x27;s degree subjects that are equivalent to the CMA program. Some of these universities also provide in-house training and examinations of the CMA program. Accounting graduates can do CMA accredited units at these universities to qualify for CMA status. The ICMA also has a number of Recognised Provider Institutions (RPIs) that run the CMA program in Australia and overseas. The CMA program is also available online in regions where the face-to-face delivery of the program is not possible.

==Scope, practice, and application==
The Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (AICPA) states management accounting as a practice that extends to the following three areas:
* Strategic management — advancing the role of the management accountant as a strategic partner in the organization
* Performance management — developing the practice of business decision-making and managing the performance of the organization
* Risk management — contributing to frameworks and practices for identifying, measuring, managing and reporting risks to the achievement of the objectives of the organization

The Institute of Certified Management Accountants (CMA) states, &quot;A management accountant applies his or her professional knowledge and skill in the preparation and presentation of financial and other decision oriented information in such a way as to assist management in the formulation of policies and in the planning and control of the operation undertaking&quot;.

Management accountants are seen as the &quot;value-creators&quot; amongst the accountants. They are more concerned with forward-looking and taking decisions that will affect the future of the organization; than in the historical recording and compliance (score keeping) aspects of the profession. Management accounting knowledge and experience can be obtained from varied fields and functions within an organization, such as information management, treasury, efficiency auditing, marketing, valuation, pricing, and logistics. In 2014 CIMA created the Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAPs). The result of research from across 20 countries in five continents, the principles aim to guide best practice in the discipline.

==Financial versus Management accounting==

Management accounting information differs from financial accountancy information in several ways:
* while shareholders, creditors, and public regulators use publicly reported financial accountancy, information, only managers within the organization use the normally confidential management accounting information
* while financial accountancy information is historical, management accounting information is primarily forward-looking;
* while financial accountancy information is case-based, management accounting information is model-based with a degree of abstraction in order to support generic decision making;
* while financial accountancy information is computed by reference to general financial accounting standards, management accounting information is computed by reference to the needs of managers, often using management information systems.
Focus: 
* Financial accounting focuses on the company as a whole.
* Management accounting provides detailed and disaggregated information about products, individual activities, divisions, plants, operations and tasks.

==Traditional versus innovative practices==
The distinction between traditional and innovative accounting practices is illustrated with the visual timeline &quot;(see sidebar)&quot; of managerial costing approaches presented at the Institute of Management Accountants 2011 Annual Conference.

Traditional standard costing (TSC), used in cost accounting, dates back to the 1920s and is a central method in management accounting practiced today because it is used for financial statement reporting for the valuation of income statement and balance sheet line items such as cost of goods sold (COGS) and inventory valuation. Traditional standard costing must comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP US) and actually aligns itself more with answering financial accounting requirements rather than providing solutions for management accountants. Traditional approaches limit themselves by defining cost behavior only in terms of production or sales volume.

In the late 1980s, accounting practitioners and educators were heavily criticized on the grounds that management accounting practices (and, even more so, the curriculum taught to accounting students) had changed little over the preceding 60 years, despite radical changes in the business environment. In 1993, the Accounting Education Change Commission Statement Number 4 calls for faculty members to expand their knowledge about the actual practice of accounting in the workplace. Professional accounting institutes, perhaps fearing that management accountants would increasingly be seen as superfluous in business organizations, subsequently devoted considerable resources to the development of a more innovative skills set for management accountants.

Variance analysis is a systematic approach to the comparison of the actual and budgeted costs of the raw materials and labour used during a production period. While some form of variance analysis is still used by most manufacturing firms, it nowadays tends to be used in conjunction with innovative techniques such as &quot;life cycle cost analysis&quot; and &quot;activity-based costing&quot;, which are designed with specific aspects of the modern business environment in mind. &quot;Life-cycle costing&quot; recognizes that managers&#x27; ability to influence the cost of manufacturing a product is at its greatest when the product is still at the design stage of its product life-cycle (i.e., before the design has been finalized and production commenced), since small changes to the product design may lead to significant savings in the cost of manufacturing the products.

Activity-based costing (ABC) recognizes that, in modern factories, most manufacturing costs are determined by the amount of &#x27;activities&#x27; (e.g., the number of production runs per month, and the amount of production equipment idle time) and that the key to effective cost control is therefore optimizing the efficiency of these activities. Both lifecycle costing and activity-based costing recognize that, in the typical modern factory, the avoidance of disruptive events (such as machine breakdowns and quality control failures) is of far greater importance than (for example) reducing the costs of raw materials. Activity-based costing also de-emphasizes direct labor as a cost driver and concentrates instead on activities that drive costs, as the provision of a service or the production of a product component.

Other approach is the German Grenzplankostenrechnung (GPK) costing methodology. Although it has been in practiced in Europe for more than 50 years, neither GPK nor the proper treatment of &#x27;unused capacity&#x27; is widely practiced in the U.S.

Another accounting practice available today is resource consumption accounting (RCA). RCA has been recognized by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) as a &quot;sophisticated approach at the upper levels of the continuum of costing techniques&quot; The approach provides the ability to derive costs directly from operational resource data or to isolate and measure unused capacity costs. RCA was derived by taking costing characteristics of GPK, and combining the use of activity-based drivers when needed, such as those used in activity-based costing.

A modern approach to close accounting is continuous accounting, which focuses on achieving a point-in-time close, where accounting processes typically performed at period-end are distributed evenly throughout the period.

==Role within a corporation==
Consistent with other roles in modern corporations, management accountants have a dual reporting relationship. As a strategic partner and provider of decision based financial and operational information, management accountants are responsible for managing the business team and at the same time having to report relationships and responsibilities to the corporation&#x27;s finance organization and finance of an organization.

The activities management accountants provide inclusive of forecasting and planning, performing variance analysis, reviewing and monitoring costs inherent in the business are ones that have dual accountability to both finance and the business team. Examples of tasks where accountability may be more meaningful to the business management team vs. the corporate finance department are the development of new product costing, operations research, business driver metrics, sales management scorecarding, and client profitability analysis. (See financial planning.) Conversely, the preparation of certain financial reports, reconciliations of the financial data to source systems, risk and regulatory reporting will be more useful to the corporate finance team as they are charged with aggregating certain financial information from all segments of the corporation.

In corporations that derive much of their profits from the information economy, such as banks, publishing houses, telecommunications companies and defence contractors, IT costs are a significant source of uncontrollable spending, which in size is often the greatest corporate cost after total compensation costs and property related costs. A function of management accounting in such organizations is to work closely with the IT department to provide IT cost transparency.

Given the above, one view of the progression of the accounting and finance career path is that financial accounting is a stepping stone to management accounting. Consistent with the notion of value creation, management accountants help drive the success of the business while strict financial accounting is more of a compliance and historical endeavor.

==Specific methodologies==

===Activity-based costing (ABC)===
Activity-based costing was first clearly defined in 1987 by Robert S. Kaplan and W. Bruns as a chapter in their book &quot;Accounting and Management: A Field Study Perspective&quot;. They initially focused on the manufacturing industry, where increasing technology and productivity improvements have reduced the relative proportion of the direct costs of labor and materials, but have increased relative proportion of indirect costs. For example, increased automation has reduced labor, which is a direct cost, but has increased depreciation, which is an indirect cost.

===Grenzplankostenrechnung===
Grenzplankostenrechnung (GPK) is a German costing methodology, developed in the late 1940s and 1960s, designed to provide a consistent and accurate application of how managerial costs are calculated and assigned to a product or service. The term Grenzplankostenrechnung, often referred to as GPK, has best been translated as either &quot;marginal planned cost accounting&quot; or &quot;flexible analytic cost planning and accounting&quot;.

The origins of GPK are credited to Hans Georg Plaut, an automotive engineer, and Wolfgang Kilger, an academic, working towards the mutual goal of identifying and delivering a sustained methodology designed to correct and enhance cost accounting information. GPK is published in cost accounting textbooks, notably &quot;Flexible Plankostenrechnung und Deckungsbeitragsrechnung&quot; and taught at German-speaking universities.

===Lean accounting (accounting for lean enterprise)===

In the mid- to late-1990s several books were written about accounting in the lean enterprise (companies implementing elements of the Toyota Production System). The term &quot;lean accounting&quot; was coined during that period. These books contest that traditional accounting methods are better suited for mass production and do not support or measure good business practices in just-in-time manufacturing and services. The movement reached a tipping point during the 2005 Lean Accounting Summit in Dearborn, Michigan, United States. 320 individuals attended and discussed the advantages of a new approach to accounting in the lean enterprise. 520 individuals attended the 2nd annual conference in 2006 and it has varied between 250 and 600 attendees since that time.

===Resource consumption accounting (RCA)===

Resource consumption accounting (RCA) is formally defined as a dynamic, fully integrated, principle-based, and comprehensive management accounting approach that provides managers with decision support information for enterprise optimization. RCA emerged as a management accounting approach around 2000 and was subsequently developed at CAM-I, the Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing–International, in a Cost Management Section &quot;RCA interest group&quot; in December 2001.

===Throughput accounting===

The most significant recent direction in managerial accounting is throughput accounting; which recognizes the interdependencies of modern production processes. For any given product, customer or supplier, it is a tool to measure the contribution per unit of constrained resource.

===Transfer pricing===

Management accounting is an applied discipline used in various industries. The specific functions and principles followed can vary based on the industry. Management accounting principles in banking are specialized but do have some common fundamental concepts used whether the industry is manufacturing-based or service-oriented. For example, transfer pricing is a concept used in manufacturing but is also applied in banking. It is a fundamental principle used in assigning value and revenue attribution to the various business units. Essentially, transfer pricing in banking is the method of assigning the interest rate risk of the bank to the various funding sources and uses of the enterprise. Thus, the bank&#x27;s corporate treasury department will assign funding charges to the business units for their use of the bank&#x27;s resources when they make loans to clients. The treasury department will also assign funding credit to business units who bring in deposits (resources) to the bank. Although the funds transfer pricing process is primarily applicable to the loans and deposits of the various banking units, this proactive is applied to all assets and liabilities of the business segment. Once transfer pricing is applied and any other management accounting entries or adjustments are posted to the ledger (which are usually memo accounts and are not included in the legal entity results), the business units are able to produce segment financial results which are used by both internal and external users to evaluate performance.
==Resources and continuous learning==
There are a variety of ways to keep current and continue to build one&#x27;s knowledge base in the field of management accounting. Certified Management Accountants (CMAs) are required to achieve continuing education hours every year, similar to a Certified Public Accountant. A company may also have research and training materials available for use in a corporate owned library. This is more common in Fortune 500 companies who have the resources to fund this type of training medium.

There are also journals, online articles and blogs available. The journal &quot;Cost Management&quot; () and the Institute of Management Accounting (IMA) site are sources which include &quot;Management Accounting Quarterly&quot; and &quot;Strategic Finance&quot; publications.

<doc id="42273" wikidata="Q148571" url="?curid=42273" title="Fence">
<text>A fence is a structure that encloses an area, typically outdoors, and is usually constructed from posts that are connected by boards, wire, rails or netting. A fence differs from a wall in not having a solid foundation along its whole length.

Alternatives to fencing include a ditch (sometimes filled with water, forming a moat).

==Types==



===By function===
* Agricultural fencing, to keep livestock in and/or predators out
* Blast fence, a safety device that redirects the high energy exhaust from a jet engine 
* Sound barrier or acoustic fencing, to reduce noise pollution
* Crowd control barrier
* Privacy fencing, to provide privacy and security 
* Temporary fencing, to provide safety, security, and to direct movement; wherever temporary access control is required, especially on building and construction sites
* Perimeter fencing, to prevent trespassing or theft and/or to keep children and pets from wandering away.
* Decorative fencing, to enhance the appearance of a property, garden or other landscaping
* Boundary fencing, to demarcate a piece of real property
* Newt fencing, amphibian fencing, drift fencing or turtle fence, a low fence of plastic sheeting or similar materials to restrict movement of amphibians or reptiles.
* Pest-exclusion fence
* Pet fence, an underground fence for pet containment
* Pool fence
* Snow fence
* School fence
* Solar fence

A balustrade or railing is a fence to prevent people from falling over an edge, most commonly found on a stairway, landing, or balcony. Railing systems and balustrades are also used along roofs, bridges, cliffs, pits, and bodies of water.

Another aim of using fence is to limit the intrusion attempt into a property by malicious intruders. In support of these barriers there are sophisticated technologies that can be applied on fence itself and strengthen the defence of territory reducing the risk. 

The elements that reinforce the perimeter protection are:

* Detectors 
* Peripheral alarm control unit
* Means of deterrence
* Means for communicating information remotely
* remote alarm receiving unit

===By construction===
* Brushwood fencing, a fence made using wires on either side of brushwood, to compact the brushwood material together.
* Chain-link fencing, wire fencing made of wires woven together
* Chicane
* Close boarded fencing, strong and robust fence constructed from mortised posts, arris rails and vertical feather edge boards
* Composite Fencing, made from a mixture of recycled wood and plastic
* Expanding fence or trellis, a folding structure made from wood or metal on the scissor-like pantograph principle, sometimes only as a temporary barrier
* Ha-ha (or sunken fence)
* Hedge, including:
** Cactus fence
** Hedgerows of intertwined, living shrubs (constructed by hedge laying)
** Live fencing is the use of live woody species for fences
** Turf mounds in semiarid grasslands such as the western United States or Russian steppes
* Hurdle fencing, made from moveable sections
* Pale fence, or &quot;post-and-rail&quot; fence, composed of pales - vertical posts embedded in the ground, with their exposed end typically tapered to shed water and prevent rot from moisture entering end-grain wood - joined by horizontal rails, characteristically in two or three courses.
* Palisade, or stakewall, made of vertical pales placed side by side with one end embedded in the ground and the other typically sharpened, to provide protection; characteristically two courses of waler are added on the interior side to reinforce the wall.
* Picket fences, generally a waist-high, painted, partially decorative fence
* Roundpole fences, similar to post-and-rail fencing but more closely spaced rails, typical of Scandinavia and other areas rich in raw timber.
* Slate fence, a type of palisade made of vertical slabs of slate wired together. Commonly used in parts of Wales.
* Split-rail fence, made of timber, often laid in a zig-zag pattern, particularly in newly settled parts of the United States and Canada
* Vaccary fence (named from Latin &quot;vaca&quot; - cow), for restraining cattle, made of thin slabs of stone placed upright, found in various places in the north of the UK where suitable stone is had.
* Vinyl fencing
* Solid fences, including:
** Dry-stone wall or rock fence, often agricultural
** Stockade fence, a solid fence composed of contiguous or very closely spaced round or half-round posts, or stakes, typically pointed at the top. A scaled down version of a palisade wall made of logs, most commonly used for privacy.
* Wattle fencing, of split branches woven between stakes.
* Wire fences
** Smooth wire fence
** Barbed wire fence
** Electric fence
** Woven wire fencing, many designs, from fine chicken wire to heavy mesh &quot;sheep fence&quot; or &quot;ring fence&quot;
** Welded wire mesh fence
* Wood-panel fencing, whereby finished wood planks are arranged to make large solid panels, which are then suspended between posts, making an almost completely solid wall-like barrier. Usually as a decorative perimeter.
* Wrought iron fencing, also known as ornamental iron

==Legal issues==
In most developed areas the use of fencing is regulated, variously in commercial, residential, and agricultural areas. Height, material, setback, and aesthetic issues are among the considerations subject to regulation.

===Required use===

The following types of areas or facilities often are required by law to be fenced in, for safety and security reasons:

* Facilities with open high-voltage equipment (transformer stations, mast radiators). Transformer stations are usually surrounded with barbed-wire fences. Around mast radiators, wooden fences are used to avoid the problem of eddy currents.
* Railway lines (in the United Kingdom)
*fixed machinery with dangerous mobile parts (for example at merry go rounds on entertainment parks)
* Explosive factories and quarry stores
* Most industrial plants
* Airfields and airports
* Military areas
* Prisons
* Construction sites
* Zoos and wildlife parks
* Pastures containing male breeding animals, notably bulls and stallions.
* Open-air areas that charge an entry fee
* Amusement equipment which may pose danger for passers-by
* Swimming pools and spas

=== History ===

Servitudes are legal arrangements of land use arising out of private agreements. Under the feudal system, most land in England was cultivated in common fields, where peasants were allocated strips of arable land that were used to support the needs of the local village or manor. By the sixteenth century the growth of population and prosperity provided incentives for landowners to use their land in more profitable ways, dispossessing the peasantry. Common fields were aggregated and enclosed by large and enterprising farmers—either through negotiation among one another or by lease from the landlord—to maximize the productivity of the available land and contain livestock. Fences redefined the means by which land is used, resulting in the modern law of servitudes.


In the United States, the earliest settlers claimed land by simply fencing it in. Later, as the American government formed, unsettled land became technically owned by the government and programs to register land ownership developed, usually making raw land available for low prices or for free, if the owner improved the property, including the construction of fences. However, the remaining vast tracts of unsettled land were often used as a commons, or, in the American West, &quot;open range&quot; as degradation of habitat developed due to overgrazing and a tragedy of the commons situation arose, common areas began to either be allocated to individual landowners via mechanisms such as the Homestead Act and Desert Land Act and fenced in, or, if kept in public hands, leased to individual users for limited purposes, with fences built to separate tracts of public and private land.

===United Kingdom===
====Generally====
Ownership of a fence on a boundary varies. The last relevant original title deed(s) and a completed seller&#x27;s property information form may document which side has to put up and has installed any fence respectively; the first using &quot;T&quot; marks/symbols (the side with the &quot;T&quot; denotes the owner); the latter by a ticked box to the best of the last owner&#x27;s belief with no duty, as the conventionally agreed conveyancing process stresses, to make any detailed, protracted enquiry. Commonly the mesh or panelling is in mid-position. Otherwise it tends to be on non-owner&#x27;s side so the fence owner might access the posts when repairs are needed but this is not a legal requirement. Where estate planners wish to entrench privacy a close-boarded fence or equivalent well-maintained hedge of a minimum height may be stipulated by deed. Beyond a standard height planning permission is necessary.

====The hedge and ditch ownership presumption====
Where a rural fence or hedge has (or in some cases had) an adjacent ditch, the ditch is normally in the same ownership as the hedge or fence, with the ownership boundary being the edge of the ditch furthest from the fence or hedge. The principle of this rule is that an owner digging a boundary ditch will normally dig it up to the very edge of their land, and must then pile the spoil on their own side of the ditch to avoid trespassing on their neighbour. They may then erect a fence or hedge on the spoil, leaving the ditch on its far side. Exceptions exist in law, for example where a plot of land derives from subdivision of a larger one along the centre line of a previously existing ditch or other feature, particularly where reinforced by historic parcel numbers with acreages beneath which were used to tally up a total for administrative units not to confirm the actual size of holdings, a rare instance where Ordnance Survey maps often provide more than circumstantial evidence namely as to which feature is to be considered the boundary.

====Fencing of livestock====
On private land in the United Kingdom, it is the landowner&#x27;s responsibility to fence their livestock in. Conversely, for common land, it is the surrounding landowners&#x27; duty to fence the common&#x27;s livestock out such as in large parts of the New Forest. Large commons with livestock roaming have been greatly reduced by 18th and 19th century Acts for enclosure of commons covering most local units, with most remaining such land in the UK&#x27;s National Parks.

====Fencing of railways====
A 19th-century law requires railways to be fenced to keep people and livestock out. It is also illegal to trespass on railways, incurring a fine of up to £1000.

===United States===
Distinctly different land ownership and fencing patterns arose in the eastern and western United States. Original fence laws on the east coast were based on the British common law system, and rapidly increasing population quickly resulted in laws requiring livestock to be fenced in. In the west, land ownership patterns and policies reflected a strong influence of Spanish law and tradition, plus the vast land area involved made extensive fencing impractical until mandated by a growing population and conflicts between landowners. The &quot;open range&quot; tradition of requiring landowners to fence out unwanted livestock was dominant in most of the rural west until very late in the 20th century, and even today, a few isolated regions of the west still have open range statutes on the books. More recently, fences are generally constructed on the surveyed property line as precisely as possible. Today, across the nation, each state is free to develop its own laws regarding fences. In many cases for both rural and urban property owners, the laws were designed to require adjacent landowners to share the responsibility for maintaining a common boundary fenceline. Today, however, only 22 states have retained that provision.

Some U.S. states, including Texas, Illinois, Missouri, and North Carolina, have enacted laws establishing that purple paint markings on fences (or trees) are the legal equivalent of &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs. The laws are meant to spare landowners, particularly in rural areas, from having to continually replace printed signs that often end up being stolen or obliterated by the elements.

==Cultural value of fences==
The value of fences and the metaphorical significance of a fence, both positive and negative, has been extensively utilized throughout western culture. A few examples include:
*&quot;Good fences make good neighbors.&quot; – a proverb quoted by Robert Frost in the poem &quot;Mending Wall&quot;
*&quot;A good neighbor is a fellow who smiles at you over the back fence, but doesn&#x27;t climb over it.&quot; – Arthur Baer
*&quot;There is something about jumping a horse over a fence, something that makes you feel good. Perhaps it&#x27;s the risk, the gamble. In any event it&#x27;s a thing I need.&quot; – William Faulkner
*&quot;Fear is the highest fence.&quot; – Dudley Nichols
*&quot;To be fenced in is to be withheld.&quot; – Kurt Tippett
*&quot;What have they done to the earth? / What have they done to our fair sister? / Ravaged and plundered / and ripped her / and bit her / stuck her with knives / in the side of the dawn / and tied her with fences / and dragged her down.&quot; – Jim Morrison, of The Doors
*&quot;Don&#x27;t Fence Me In&quot; – Cole Porter
*&quot;You shall build a turtle fence.&quot; – Peter Hoekstra
*&quot;A woman&#x27;s dress should be like a barbed-wire fence: serving its purpose without obstructing the view.&quot; – Sophia Loren

<text>Barbed wire, also known as barb wire or bob wire, is a type of steel fencing wire constructed with sharp edges or points arranged at intervals along the strands. Its primary use is the construction of inexpensive fences, and it is also used as a security measure atop walls surrounding property. As a wire obstacle, it is a major feature of the fortifications in trench warfare.

A person or animal trying to pass through or over barbed wire will suffer discomfort and possibly injury. Barbed wire fencing requires only fence posts, wire, and fixing devices such as staples. It is simple to construct and quick to erect, even by an unskilled person.

The first patent in the United States for barbed wire was issued in 1867 to Lucien B. Smith of Kent, Ohio, who is regarded as the inventor. Joseph F. Glidden of DeKalb, Illinois, received a patent for the modern invention in 1874 after he made his own modifications to previous versions.

Wire fences are cheaper and easier to erect than their alternatives (one such alternative is Osage orange, a thorny bush that is time-consuming to transplant and grow). When wire fences became widely available in the United States in the late 19th century, it became more affordable to fence much larger areas than before, and intensive animal husbandry was made practical on a much larger scale.

An example of the costs of fencing with lumber immediately prior to the invention of barbed wire can be found with the first farmers in the Fresno, California, area, who spent nearly $4,000 () to have wood for fencing delivered and erected to protect of wheat crop from free-ranging livestock in 1872.

== Design ==
; Materials:
* Zinc-coated steel wire. Galvanized steel wire is the most widely used steel wire during barbed wire production. It has commercial type, Class 1 type and Class 3 type. Or it is also well known as electric galvanized steel wire and hot dipped galvanized steel wire.
* Zinc-aluminum alloy coated steel wire. Barbed wire is available with zinc, 5% or 10% aluminum alloy and mischmetal steel wire, which is also known as Galfan wire.
* Polymer-coated steel wire. Zinc steel wire or zinc-aluminum steel wire with PVC, PE or other organic polymer coating.
* Stainless steel wire. It is available with SAE 304, 316 and other materials.

; Strand structure:
* Single strand. Simple and light duty structure with single line wire (also known as strand wire) and barbs.
* Double strand. Conventional structure with double strand wire (line wire) and barbs.

; Barb structure:
* Single barb. Also known as 2-point barbed wire. It uses single barb wire twisted on the line wire (strand wire).
* Double barb. Also known as 4-point barbed wire. Two barb wires twisted on the line wire (strand wire).

; Twist type:
* Conventional twist. The strand wire (line wire) are twisted in single direction, which is also known as traditional twist. Besides, the barb wires are twisted between the two strand wire (line wire).
* Reverse twist. The strand wire (line wire) are twisted in opposite direction. Besides, the barb wires are twisted outside of the two line wire.

== History ==

=== Before 1865 ===

Fencing consisting of flat and thin wire was first proposed in France, by Leonce Eugene Grassin-Baledans in 1860. His design consisted of bristling points, creating a fence that was painful to cross. In April 1865 Louis François Janin proposed a double wire with diamond-shaped metal barbs; Francois was granted a patent. Michael Kelly from New York had a similar idea, and proposed that the fencing should be used specifically for deterring animals.

More patents followed, and in 1867 alone there were six patents issued for barbed wire. Only two of them addressed livestock deterrence, one of which was from American Lucien B. Smith of Ohio. Before 1870, westward movement in the United States was largely across the plains with little or no settlement occurring. After the American Civil War the plains were extensively settled, consolidating America&#x27;s dominance over them.

Ranchers moved out on the plains, and needed to fence their land in against encroaching farmers and other ranchers. The railroads throughout the growing West needed to keep livestock off their tracks, and farmers needed to keep stray cattle from trampling their crops. Traditional fence materials used in the Eastern U.S., like wood and stone, were expensive to use in the large open spaces of the plains, and hedging was not reliable in the rocky, clay-based and rain-starved dusty soils. A cost-effective alternative was needed to make cattle operations profitable.

=== 1873 meeting and initial development ===

The &quot;Big Four&quot; in barbed wire were Joseph Glidden, Jacob Haish, Charles Francis Washburn, and Isaac L. Ellwood. Glidden, a farmer in 1873 and the first of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, is often credited for designing a successful sturdy barbed wire product, but he let others popularize it for him. Glidden&#x27;s idea came from a display at a fair in DeKalb, Illinois in 1873, by Henry B. Rose. Rose had patented &quot;The Wooden Strip with Metallic Points&quot; in May 1873.

This was simply a wooden block with wire protrusions designed to keep cows from breaching the fence. That day, Glidden was accompanied by two other men, Isaac L. Ellwood, a hardware dealer and Jacob Haish, a lumber merchant. Like Glidden, they both wanted to create a more durable wire fence with fixed barbs. Glidden experimented with a grindstone to twist two wires together to hold the barbs on the wire in place. The barbs were created from experiments with a coffee mill from his home.

Later Glidden was joined by Ellwood who knew his design could not compete with Glidden&#x27;s for which he applied for a patent in October 1873. Meanwhile, Haish, who had already secured several patents for barbed wire design, applied for a patent on his third type of wire, the S barb, and accused Glidden of interference, deferring Glidden&#x27;s approval for his patented wire, nicknamed &quot;The Winner&quot;, until November 24, 1874.

Barbed wire production greatly increased with Glidden and Ellwood&#x27;s establishment of the Barb Fence Company in DeKalb following the success of &quot;The Winner&quot;. The company&#x27;s success attracted the attention of Charles Francis Washburn, Vice President of Washburn &amp; Moen Manufacturing Company, an important producer of plain wire in the Eastern U.S. Washburn visited DeKalb and convinced Glidden to sell his stake in the Barb Wire Fence Company, while Ellwood stayed in DeKalb and renamed the company I.L Ellwood &amp; Company of DeKalb.

=== Promotion and consolidation ===

In the late 1870s, John Warne Gates of Illinois began to promote barbed wire, now a proven product, in the lucrative markets of Texas. At first, Texans were hesitant, as they feared that cattle might be harmed, or that the North was somehow trying to make profits from the South. There was also conflict between the farmers who wanted fencing and the ranchers who were losing the open range.

Demonstrations by Gates in San Antonio in 1876 showed that the wire could keep cattle contained, and sales then increased dramatically. Gates eventually parted company with Ellwood and became a barbed wire baron in his own right. Throughout the height of barbed wire sales in the late 19th century, Washburn, Ellwood, Gates, and Haish competed with one another. Ellwood and Gates eventually joined forces again to create the American Steel and Wire Company, later acquired by The U.S. Steel Corporation.

Between 1873 and 1899 there were as many as 150 companies manufacturing barbed wire. Investors knew that the business required minimal capital, and almost anyone with determination could profit by manufacturing a new wire design. There was then a sharp decline in the number of manufacturers, and many were consolidated into larger companies, notably the American Steel and Wire Company, formed by the merging of Gates&#x27;s and Washburn&#x27;s and Ellwood&#x27;s industries.

Smaller companies were decimated because of economies of scale and the smaller pool of consumers available to them, compared to the larger corporations. The American Steel and Wire Company established in 1899 employed vertical integration: it controlled all aspects of production, from producing the steel rods to making many different wire and nail products from that steel. It later became part of U.S. Steel, and barbed wire remained a major source of revenue.

=== In the American West ===
Barbed wire was important in protecting range rights in the Western U.S. Although some ranchers put notices in newspapers claiming land areas, and joined stockgrowers associations to help enforce their claims, livestock continued to cross range boundaries. Fences of smooth wire did not hold stock well, and hedges were difficult to grow and maintain. Barbed wire&#x27;s introduction in the West in the 1870s dramatically reduced the cost of enclosing land. 

One fan wrote the inventor Joseph Glidden:
:it takes no room, exhausts no soil, shades no vegetation, is proof against high winds, makes no snowdrifts, and is both durable and cheap.

Barbed wire emerged as a major source of conflict with the so-called &quot;Big Die Up&quot; incident in the 1880s. This occurred because of the instinctual migrations of cattle away from the blizzard conditions of the Northern Plains to the warmer and plentiful Southern Plains, but by the early 1880s this area was already divided and claimed by ranchers. The ranchers in place, especially in the Texas Panhandle, knew that their holdings could not support the grazing of additional cattle, so the only alternative was to block the migrations with barb wire fencing.

Many of the herds were decimated in the winter of 1885, with some losing as many as three-quarters of all animals when they could not find a way around the fence. Later other smaller scale cattlemen, especially in central Texas, opposed the closing of the open range, and began cutting fences to allow cattle to pass through to find grazing land. In this transition zone between the agricultural regions to the south and the rangeland to the north, conflict erupted, with vigilantes joining the scene causing chaos and even death. The Fence Cutting Wars ended with the passage of a Texas law in 1884 that made fence cutting a felony. Other states followed, although conflicts occurred through the early years of the 20th century. An 1885 federal law forbade placing such fences across the public domain.

Barbed wire is cited by historians as the invention that tamed the West. Herding large numbers of cattle on open range required significant manpower to catch strays. Barbed wire provided an inexpensive method to control the movement of cattle. By the beginning of the 20th century, large numbers of cowboys were unnecessary.

=== In the Southwest United States ===

John Warne Gates demonstrated barbed wire for Washburn and Moen in Military Plaza, San Antonio, Texas in 1876. The demonstration showing cattle restrained by the new kind of fencing was followed immediately by invitations to the Menger Hotel to place orders. Gates subsequently had a falling out with Washburn and Moen and Isaac Ellwood. He moved to St. Louis and founded the Southern Wire Company, which became the largest manufacturer of unlicensed or &quot;bootleg&quot; barbed wire.

An 1880 US District Court decision upheld the validity of the Glidden patent, effectively establishing a monopoly. This decision was affirmed by the US Supreme Court in 1892. In 1898 Gates took control of Washburn and Moen, and created the American Steel and Wire monopoly, which became a part of the United States Steel Corporation.

This led to disputes known as the range wars between open range ranchers and farmers in the late 19th century. These were similar to the disputes which resulted from enclosure laws in England in the early 18th century. These disputes were decisively settled in favor of the farmers, and heavy penalties were instituted for cutting a barbed wire fence. Within 2 years, nearly all of the open range had been fenced in under private ownership. For this reason, some historians have dated the end of the Old West era of American history to the invention and subsequent proliferation of barbed wire.

== Installation ==

The most important and most time-consuming part of a barbed wire fence is constructing the &quot;corner post&quot; and the bracing assembly. A barbed wire fence is under tremendous tension, often up to half a ton, and so the corner post&#x27;s sole function is to resist the tension of the fence spans connected to it. The bracing keeps the corner post vertical and prevents slack from developing in the fence.

&quot;Brace posts&quot; are placed in-line about from the corner post. A horizontal &quot;compression brace&quot; connects the top of the two posts, and a diagonal wire connects the top of the brace post to the bottom of the corner post. This diagonal wire prevents the brace post from leaning, which in turn allows the horizontal brace to prevent the corner post from leaning into the brace post. A second set of brace posts (forming a &quot;double brace&quot;) is used whenever the barbed wire span exceeds .

When the barbed wire span exceeds , a &quot;braced line assembly&quot; is added in-line. This has the function of a corner post and brace assembly but handles tension from opposite sides. It uses diagonal brace wire that connects the tops to the bottoms of all adjacent posts.

&quot;Line posts&quot; are installed along the span of the fence at intervals of . An interval of is most common. Heavy livestock and crowded pasture demands the smaller spacing. The sole function of a line post is not to take up slack but to keep the barbed wire strands spaced equally and off the ground.

Once these posts and bracing have been erected, the wire is wrapped around one corner post, held with a hitch (a timber hitch works well for this) often using a staple to hold the height and then reeled out along the span of the fence replacing the roll every 400 m. It is then wrapped around the opposite corner post, pulled tightly with wire stretchers, and sometimes nailed with more fence staples, although this may make readjustment of tension or replacement of the wire more difficult. Then it is attached to all of the line posts with fencing staples driven in partially to allow stretching of the wire.

There are several ways to anchor the wire to a corner post:

* Hand-knotting. The wire is wrapped around the corner post and knotted by hand. This is the most common method of attaching wire to a corner post. A timber hitch works well as it stays better with wire than with rope.
* Crimp sleeves. The wire is wrapped around the corner post and bound to the incoming wire using metal sleeves which are crimped using lock cutters. This method should be avoided because while sleeves can work well on repairs in the middle of the fence where there is not enough wire for hand knotting, they tend to slip when under tension.
* Wire vise. The wire is passed through a hole drilled into the corner post and is anchored on the far side.
* Wire wrap. The wire is wrapped around the corner post and wrapped onto a special, gritted helical wire which also wraps around the incoming wire, with friction holding it in place.

Barbed wire for agriculture use is typically double-strand -gauge, zinc-coated (galvanized) steel and comes in rolls of length. Barbed wire is usually placed on the inner (pasture) side of the posts. Where a fence runs between two pastures livestock could be with the wire on the outside or on both sides of the fence.

Galvanized wire is classified into three categories; Classes I, II, and III. Class I has the thinnest coating and the shortest life expectancy. A wire with Class I coating will start showing general rusting in 8 to 10 years, while the same wire with Class III coating will show rust in 15 to 20 years. Aluminum-coated wire is occasionally used, and yields a longer life.

Corner posts are in diameter or larger, and a minimum in length may consist of treated wood or from durable on-site trees such as osage orange, black locust, red cedar, or red mulberry, also railroad ties, telephone, and power poles are salvaged to be used as corner posts (poles and railroad ties were often treated with chemicals determined to be an environmental hazard and cannot be reused in some jurisdictions). In Canada spruce posts are sold for this purpose. Posts are in diameter driven at least and may be anchored in a concrete base square and deep. Iron posts, if used, are a minimum in diameter. Bracing wire is typically smooth 9-gauge. Line posts are set to a depth of about . Conversely, steel posts are not as stiff as wood, and wires are fastened with slips along fixed teeth, which means variations in driving height affect wire spacing.

During the First World War, screw pickets were used for the installation of wire obstacles; these were metal rods with eyelets for holding strands of wire, and a corkscrew-like end that could literally be screwed into the ground rather than hammered, so that wiring parties could work at night near enemy soldiers and not reveal their position by the sound of hammers.

=== Gates ===
As with any fence, barbed wire fences require gates to allow the passage of persons, vehicles and farm implements. Gates vary in width from to allow the passage of vehicles and tractors, to on farm land to pass combines and swathers.

One style of gate is called the Hampshire gate in the UK, a New Zealand gate in some areas, and often simply a &quot;gate&quot; elsewhere. Made of wire with posts attached at both ends and in the middle, it is permanently wired on one side and attaches to a gate post with wire loops on the other. Most designs can be opened by hand, though some gates that are frequently opened and closed may have a lever attached to assist in bringing the upper wire loop over the gate post.

Gates for cattle tend to have four wires when along a three wire fence, as cattle tend to put more stress on gates, particularly on corner gates. The fence on each side of the gate ends with two corner posts braced or unbraced depending on the size of the post. An unpounded post (often an old broken post) is held to one corner post with wire rings which act as hinges. On the other end a full-length post, the tractor post, is placed with the pointed end upwards with a ring on the bottom stapled to the other corner post, the latch post, and on top a ring is stapled to the tractor post, tied with a Stockgrower&#x27;s Lash or one of numerous other opening bindings. Wires are then tied around the post at one end then run to the other end where they are stretched by hand or with a stretcher, before posts are stapled on every . Often this type of gate is called a portagee fence or a portagee gate in various ranching communities of coastal Central California.

Most gates can be opened by push post. The chain is then wrapped around the tractor post and pulled onto the nail, stronger people can pull the gate tighter but anyone can jar off the chain to open the gate.

== Uses ==

=== Agriculture ===
Barbed wire fences remain the standard fencing technology for enclosing cattle in most regions of the United States, but not all countries. The wire is aligned under tension between heavy, braced, fence posts (strainer posts) and then held at the correct height by being attached to wooden or steel fence posts, and/or with battens in between.

The gaps between posts vary depending on type and terrain. On short fences in hilly country, steel posts may be placed every , while in flat terrain with long spans and relatively few stock they may be spaced up to apart. Wooden posts are normally spaced at on all terrain, with 4 or 5 battens in between. However, many farmers place posts apart as battens can bend, causing wires to close in on one another.

Barbed wire for agricultural fencing is typically available in two varieties: soft or mild-steel wire and high-tensile. Both types are galvanized for longevity. High-tensile wire is made with thinner but higher-strength steel. Its greater strength makes fences longer lasting because it resists stretching and loosening better, coping with expansion and contraction caused by heat and animal pressure by stretching and relaxing within wider elastic limits. It also supports longer spans, but because of its elastic (springy) nature, it is harder to handle and somewhat dangerous for inexperienced fencers. Soft wire is much easier to work but is less durable and only suitable for short spans such as repairs and gates, where it is less likely to tangle.

In high soil-fertility areas where dairy cattle are used in great numbers, 5- or 7-wire fences are common as the main boundary and internal dividing fences. On sheep farms 7-wire fences are common with the second (from bottom) to fifth wire being plain wire. In New Zealand wire fences must provide passage for dogs since they are the main means of controlling and driving animals on farms.

Around the turn of the 20th century, in some rural areas, barbed wire fences were used for local telephone networks.

=== Warfare and law enforcement ===
Barbed wire was used for the first time by Portuguese troops defending from African tribes during the Combat of Magul in 1895. Less well known is its extensive usage in the Russo-Japanese War.

In 1899 barbed wire was also extensively used in the Boer War, where it played a strategic role bringing spaces under control, at military outposts as well as to hold the captured Boer population in concentration camps.

The government of the United States built its first international border fence from 1909 to 1911 along the California-Mexico border. It included barbed wire and was intended to keep cattle from moving between the two countries. In 1924, the United States created its border patrol, which built more barbed wire fences on the Mexican border; this time to prevent people from crossing.

More significantly, barbed wire was used extensively by all participating combatants in World War I to prevent movement, with deadly consequences. Barbed wire entanglements were placed in front of trenches to prevent direct charges on men below, increasingly leading to greater use of more advanced weapons such as high-powered machine guns and grenades. A feature of these entanglements was that the barbs were much closer together, often forming a continuous sequence.
Barbed wire could be exposed to heavy bombardments because it could be easily replaced, and its structure included so much open space that machine guns rarely destroyed enough of it to defeat its purpose. However, barbed wire was defeated by the tank in 1916, as shown by the Allied breakthrough at Amiens through German lines on August 8, 1918.

One British writer described how the Germans used barbed wire as follows: The enemy wire was always deep, thick, and securely staked with iron supports, which were either crossed like the letter X, or upright, with loops to take the wire and shaped at one end like corkscrews so as to screw into the ground. The wire stood on these supports on a thick web, about four feet high and from thirty to forty feet across. The wire used was generally as thick as sailor&#x27;s marline stuff, or two twisted rope yarns. It contained, as a rule, some sixteen barbs to the foot. The wire used in front of our lines was generally galvanized, and remained grey after months of exposure. The (German) wire, not being galvanized, rusted to a black color, and shows up black at a great distance. 

During the Great Depression, migratory work camps in the United States used barbed wire.

In the 1930s and 1940s Europe the Nazis used barbed wire in concentration camp and extermination camp architecture, where it usually surrounded the camp and was electrified to prevent escape. Barbed wire served the purpose of keeping prisoners contained.

Infirmaries in extermination camps like Auschwitz where prisoners were gassed or experimented on were often separated from other areas by electrified wire and were often braided with branches to prevent outsiders from knowing what was concealed behind their walls.

During the United States&#x27; World War II Internment of Japanese Americans, barbed wire was used to enclose the concentration camps, such as Manzanar.

During the 1968 Chicago riots, barbed wire was attached to the fronts of police and National Guard vehicles. The vehicles were used to drive into protesters and rioters and were nicknamed &quot;Daly dozers&quot; after then-Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley.

== Safety and injuries ==

Most barbed wire fences, while sufficient to discourage cattle, are passable by humans who can simply climb over or through the fence by stretching the gaps between the wires using non-barbed sections of the wire as handholds. To prevent humans crossing, many prisons, and other high-security installations construct fences with razor wire, a variant which replaces the barbs with near-continuous cutting surfaces sufficient to injure unprotected persons who climb on it. Both razor wire and barbed wire can be bypassed with protection, such as a thick carpet, or with the use of wire cutters.

A commonly seen alternative is the placement of a few strands of barbed wire at the top of a chain link fence. The limited mobility of someone climbing a fence makes passing conventional barbed wire more difficult. On some chain link fences, these strands are attached to a bracket tilted 45 degrees towards the intruder, further increasing the difficulty.

Barbed wire began to be widely used as an implement of war during World War I. Wire was placed either to impede or halt the passage of soldiers, or to channel them into narrow defiles in which small arms, particularly machine guns, and indirect fire could be used with greater effect as they attempted to pass. Artillery bombardments on the Western Front became increasingly aimed at cutting the barbed wire that was a major component of trench warfare, particularly once new &quot;wire-cutting&quot; fuzes were introduced midway through the war.

As the war progressed, the wire was used in shorter lengths that were easier to transport and more difficult to cut with artillery. Other inventions were also a result of the war, such as the screw picket, which enabled construction of wire obstacles to be done at night in No Man&#x27;s Land without the necessity of hammering stakes into the ground and drawing attention from the enemy.

During the Soviet–Afghan War, the accommodation of Afghan refugees into Pakistan was controlled in Pakistan&#x27;s largest province, Balochistan, under General Rahimuddin Khan, by making the refugees stay for controlled durations in barbed wire camps (see Controlling Soviet–Afghan war refugees).

The frequent use of barbed wire on prison walls, around concentration camps, and the like, has made it symbolic of oppression and denial of freedom in general. For example, in Germany, the totality of East Germany&#x27;s border regime is commonly referred to with the short phrase &quot;Mauer und Stacheldraht&quot; (that is, &quot;wall and barbed wire&quot;), and Amnesty International has a barbed wire in their symbol.

Movement against barbed wire can result in moderate to severe injuries to the skin and, depending on body area and barbed wire configuration, possibly to the underlying tissue. Humans can manage not to injure themselves excessively when dealing with barbed wire as long as they are cautious. Restriction of movement, appropriate clothing, and slow movement when close to barbed wire aid in reducing injury.

Infantrymen are often trained and inured to the injuries caused by barbed wire. Several soldiers can lie across the wire to form a bridge for the rest of the formation to pass over; often any injury thus incurred is due to the tread of those passing over and not to the wire itself.

Injuries caused by barbed wire are typically seen in horses, bats, or birds. Horses panic easily, and once caught in barbed wire, large patches of skin may be torn off. At best, such injuries may heal, but they may cause disability or death (particularly due to infection). Birds or bats may not be able to perceive thin strands of barbed wire and suffer injuries.

For this reason, horse fences may have rubber bands nailed parallel to the wires.
More than 60 different species of wildlife have been reported in Australia as victims of entanglement on barbed wire fences, and the wildlife friendly fencing project is beginning to address this problem.
Grazing animals with slow movements that will back off at the first notion of pain (&quot;e.g.&quot;, sheep and cows) will not generally suffer the severe injuries often seen in other animals.

Barbed wire has been reported as a tool for human torture. It is also frequently used as a weapon in hardcore professional wrestling matches, often as a covering for another type of weapon—Mick Foley was infamous for using a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire—and infrequently as a covering of or substitute for the ring ropes.

Because of the risk of injuries, in 2010 Norway prohibited making new fences with barbed wire for limiting migration of animals. Electric fences are used instead. Consequently, automotive brands such as Bentley and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is using Norwegian (and other Northern European region) hides for producing leather interior in their cars, since the hides from Norwegian cattle have fewer scratches than hides from countries where barbed wire is used.

<doc id="42277" wikidata="Q718909" url="?curid=42277" title="Aryan race">
<text>The Aryan race is a pseudoscientific historical race concept that emerged in the late-19th century to describe people who descend from the Proto-Indo-Europeans as a racial grouping. The terminology derives from the historical usage of Aryan, used by modern Indo-Iranians as an epithet of &quot;noble&quot;. Anthropological, historical, and archaeological evidence does not support the validity of this concept.

The concept derives from the notion that the original speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language were distinct progenitors of a superior specimen of humankind, and that their descendants up to the present day constitute either a distinctive race or a sub-race of the Caucasian race, alongside the Semitic race and the Hamitic race. This taxonomic approach to categorizing human population groups is now considered to be misguided and biologically meaningless due to the close genetic similarity and complex interrelationships between these groups.

The term was adopted by various racist and antisemitic writers during the 19th century, including Arthur de Gobineau, Richard Wagner, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, whose scientific racism influenced later Nazi racial ideology. By the 1930s, the concept had been associated with both Nazism and Nordicism, and used to support the white supremacist ideology of Aryanism that portrayed the Aryan race as a &quot;master race&quot;, with non-Aryans regarded as racially inferior (&quot;Untermensch&quot;, ) and an existential threat that was to be exterminated. In Nazi Germany, these ideas formed an essential part of the state ideology that led to the Holocaust.

== History ==
=== Debates on linguistic homeland ===
In the late 18th century, Proto-Indo-European (PIE) was constructed as the hypothesized common proto-language of the Indo-European languages. Sir William Jones, who was acclaimed as the &quot;most respected linguist in Europe&quot; for his &quot;Grammar of the Persian Language&quot; (1771), was appointed one of the three justices of the Supreme Court of Bengal. Jones, who arrived in Calcutta and began his study of Sanskrit and the Rig Veda, was astonished by the lexical similarities between Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages such as Persian, Gothic, Greek, and Latin, and concluded that Sanskrit—as a descendant language—belonged to the same proto- or parent-language in the language family—that is PIE, as the other Indo-European languages, in his &quot;Third Anniversary Discourse on the Hindus&quot; (1786). However, the linguistic homeland of the original speakers of Proto-Indo-European was a politicized debate among the archaeologists and comparative historical linguists since the start, entangling in chauvinistic causes. Some European nationalists and dictators, most notably the Nazis, later attempted to identify the Proto-Indo-European homeland in their country or region as racially superior.

According to Leon Poliakov, the concept of the Aryan race was deeply rooted in philology, based on the work of Sir William Jones&#x27; claiming that Sanskrit was related to Greco-Roman (European) languages. Other thinkers invented secularized origins for European civilization that were not based on the biblical genealogies from which Europe&#x27;s aristocracy had long claimed descent.

=== Romanticism and Social Darwinism ===

The influence of Romanticism in Germany saw a revival of the intellectual quest for &quot;the German language and traditions&quot; and a desire to &quot;discard the cold, artificial logic of Enlightenment&quot;. After Darwin&#x27;s 1859 publication of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; and publicization of the theorized model of Proto-Indo-European language (PIE), the Romantics convicted that language was a defining factor in national identity, combined with the new ideas of Darwinism. The German nationalists misemployed the scientific theory of natural selection for the rationalization of the supposed fitness of some races over others, although Darwin himself never applied his theory of fitness to vague entities such as races or languages. The &quot;unfit&quot; races were suggested as a source of genetic weakness, and a threat that might contaminate the superior qualities of the &quot;fit&quot; races. The misleading mixture of pseudoscience and Romanticism produced new racial ideologies which used distorted Social Darwinist interpretations of race to explain &quot;the superior biological-spiritual-linguistic essence of the Northern Europeans&quot; in self-congratulatory studies. Subsequently, the German Romantics&#x27; quest for a &quot;pure&quot; national heritage led to the interpretation of the ancient speakers of PIE language as the distinct progenitors of a &quot;racial-linguistic-national stereotype&quot;.

== Invention of the Aryan race ==
=== Racial association of the term Aryan ===

The term &quot;Aryan&quot; was originally used as an ethnocultural self-designative identity and epithet of &quot;noble&quot; by Indo-Iranians and the authors of the oldest known religious texts of &quot;Rig Veda&quot; and &quot;Avesta&quot; within the Indo-Iranian branch of Indo-European language family—Sanskrit and Iranian, who lived in ancient India and Iran. Although the Sanskrit ā́rya- and Iranian *arya- descended from a form *ā̆rya-, it was only attested to the Indo-Iranian tribes. Benjamin W. Fortson states that there may have been no term for self-designation of Proto-Indo-Europeans, and no such morphemes has survived. J. P. Mallory et al. states although the term &quot;Aryan&quot; takes on an ethnic meaning attesting to Indo-Iranians, there is no grounds for ascribing this semantic use to the Proto-Indo-European reconstruction of lexicon &quot;*h₂eryós&quot; i.e. there is no evidence that the speakers of proto-language referred to themselves as &quot;Aryans&quot;. However, in the 19th century, it was proposed that ā́rya- was not only the tribal self-designation of Indo-Iranians, but self-designation of Proto-Indo-Europeans themselves, a theory rejected by modern scholarships. &quot;Aryan&quot; then came to be used by scholars of the 19th century to refer to Indo-Europeans. The now-discredited and chronologically reconstructed North European hypothesis was endorsed by such scholars who situated the PIE homeland in northern Europe, which led to the association of &quot;Proto-Indo-Europeans&quot;, originally a hypothesized linguistic population of Eurasian PIE speakers, with a new, imagined biological category: &quot;a tall, light-complexioned, blonde, blue-eyed race&quot; - supposed phenotypic traits of Nordic race. The anglicized term &quot;Aryan&quot; then developed into a purely racialist meaning implicating Nordic racial type. However, modern scholarship of Indo-European studies use &quot;Aryan&quot; and &quot;Indo-Aryan&quot; in their original senses referring to Indo-Iranian and Indic branch of Indo-Europeans.

Classification of human races based on the now-pseudoscientific study of phenotypical differences developed during the nineteenth century and evidence in support of such theories were sought from the study of language and reconstructions of language families. Scholars of this era established the ethnological term &quot;Aryan&quot; as the race that had spoken the Proto-Indo-European language, and in this context, the term was often used as a synonym for &quot;Indo-Europeans&quot;.

Scholars point out that, even in ancient times, the Aryan identity as asserted in the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; was cultural, religious, and linguistic, not racial; nor do the &quot;Vedas&quot; contemplate racial purity. The Rig Veda affirms a ritualistic barrier: an individual is considered Aryan if they sacrifice to the right gods, which requires performing traditional prayer in the traditional language, and does not connote a racial barrier. Michael Witzel states that term Aryan &quot;does not mean a particular &quot;people&quot; or even a particular &#x27;racial&#x27; group but all those who had joined the tribes speaking Vedic Sanskrit and adhering to their cultural norms (such as ritual, poetry, etc.)&quot;. Scholars state that the historical Aryans, the Vedic period Bronze Age tribes who lived in Iran, Afghanistan, and the northern Indian subcontinent—composers of the Rig Veda and Avesta—were unlikely to be blond or blue-eyed, contrary to the proponents of Aryanism and Nordicism.

=== North Europe hypothesis and archaeological affirmation ===
The racial interpretation of &quot;Aryans&quot; stems from the now-discredited culture-historical archaeology theory of Gustaf Kossinna, who asserted a one-to-one correspondence between archaeological culture and archaeological race. According to Kossinna, the continuity of a &quot;culture&quot; exposits the continuity of a &quot;race&quot; which lived continuously in the same area, and the resemblance of a culture in a younger layer to a culture from an older layer indicates that the autochthonous tribe from the homeland had migrated. Kossinna developed an ethnic paradigm in archaeology called settlement archaeology and practiced the nationalistic interpretation of German archaeology for the Third Reich. The obsolete North European hypothesis was endorsed by Kossinna and Karl Penka, including German nationalists, which was later used by the Nazis to condone their genocidal and racist state policies. Kossinna identified the Proto-Indo-Europeans with the Corded Ware culture, and placed the Proto-Indo-European homeland in Schleswig-Holstein. He argued a diffusionist model of culture, and emphasised the racial superiority of Germanic peoples over Romans (Roman Empire) and French, whom he described as destroyers of culture as compared to Germanics. Kossinna&#x27;s ideas have been heavily criticised for its inherent ambiguities in the method and advocacy for the ideology of a Germanic master race.

=== Earliest utilization of Aryan race ===

Max Müller popularized the term Aryan in his writings on comparative linguistics, and is often identified as the first writer to mention an Aryan race in English. He began the racial interpretation of the Vedic passages based upon his editing of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; from 1849 to 1874. He postulated a small Aryan clan living on a high elevation in central Asia, speaking a proto-language ancestral to later Indo-European languages, which later branched off in two directions: one moved towards Europe and the other migrated to Iran, eventually splitting again with one group invading north-western India and conquering the dark-skinned &quot;dasas&quot; of Scythian origin who lived there. The northern Aryans of Europe became energetic and combative, and they invented the idea of a nation, while the southern Aryans of Iran and India were passive and meditative and focussed on religion and philosophy.

Though he occasionally used the term &quot;Aryan race&quot; afterward, Müller later objected to the mixing of the linguistic and racial categories, and was &quot;deeply saddened by the fact that these classifications later came to be expressed in racist terms&quot;. In his 1888 lecture at Oxford, he stated, &quot;[the] science of Language and the science of Man cannot be kept too much asunder [...] it would be as wrong to speak of Aryan blood as of dolichocephalic grammar&quot;, and in his &quot;Biographies of Words and the Home of the Aryas&quot; (1888), he writes, &quot;[the] ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes, and hair, is a great sinner as a linguist [...]&quot;.

European scholars of 19th century interpreted the Vedic passages as depicting battle between light-skinned Aryan migrants and dark-skinned indigenous tribes, but modern scholars reject this characterization of racial division as a misreading of the Sanskrit text, and indicate that the Rig Vedic opposition between &quot;ārya&quot; and &quot;dasyu&quot; is distinction between &quot;disorder, chaos and dark side of human nature&quot; contrasted with the concepts of &quot;order, purity, goodness and light&quot;, and &quot;dark and light worlds&quot;. In other contexts of the Vedic passages the dinstiction between &quot;ārya&quot; and &quot;dasyu&quot; refers to those who had adopted the Vedic religion, speaking Vedic Sanskrit, and those who opposed it.

However, increasing number of Western writers of this era, especially among anthropologists and non-specialists influenced by Darwinist theories, contrasted &quot;Aryans&quot; as a &quot;physical-genetic species&quot; rather than an ethnolinguistic category.

Encyclopedias and textbooks of historiography, ethnography, and anthropology from this era, such as Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, Brockhaus Enzyklopädie, Nordisk familjebok, H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;A Short History of the World&quot;, John Clark Ridpath&#x27;s &quot;Great Races of Mankind&quot;, and other works reinforced European racial constructions developed on now-pseudoscientific concepts such as racial taxonomy, Social Darwinism, and scientific racism to classify human races.

=== Theories of racial supremacy ===
The term &quot;Aryan&quot; was adopted by various racist and antisemitic writers such as Arthur de Gobineau, Theodor Poesche, Houston Chamberlain, Paul Broca, Karl Penka and Hans Günther during the nineteenth century for the promotion of scientific racism, spawning ideologies such as Nordicism and Aryanism. The connotation of the term &quot;Aryan&quot; was detached from its proper geographic and linguistic confinement as a Indo-Iranian branch of Indo-European language family by this time. The inequality of races and the notion of a &quot;superior race&quot; was universally accepted by the scholars of this era, therefore race was referred to &quot;national character and national culture&quot; beyond biological confinement.

In 1853, Arthur de Gobineau published &quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot;, in which he originally identified the Aryan race as the white race, and the only civilized one, and conceived cultural decline and miscegenation as intimately intertwined. He argued that the Aryans represented a superior branch of humanity, and attempted to identify the races of Europe as Aryan and associated them with the sons of Noah, emphasizing superiority, and categorized non-Aryan as an intrusion of the Semitic race. According to him, northern Europeans had migrated across the world and founded the major civilizations, before being diluted through racial mixing with indigenous populations described as racially inferior, leading to the progressive decay of the ancient Aryan civilizations.

In 1878, German American anthropologist Theodor Poesche published a survey of historical references attempting to demonstrate that the Aryans were light-skinned blue-eyed blonds.

In 1899, Houston Stewart Chamberlain published what is described as &quot;one of the most important proto-Nazi texts&quot;, &quot;The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century&quot;, in which he theorized an existential struggle to the death between a superior German-Aryan race and a destructive Jewish-Semitic race.

In 1916, Madison Grant published &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot;, a polemic against interbreeding between &quot;Aryan&quot; Americans, the original Thirteen Colonies settlers of British-Scots-Irish-German origin, with immigrant &quot;inferior races&quot;, which according to him were, Poles, Czechs, Jews, and Italians. The book was a best-seller at the time.

While the Aryan race theory remained popular, particularly in Germany, some authors opposed it, in particular Otto Schrader, Rudolph von Jhering and the ethnologist Robert Hartmann, who proposed to ban the notion of Aryan from anthropology. The term was also adopted by various occultists and esoteric ideological systems of this era, such as Helena Blavatsky, and Ariosophy.

== Nazism ==
=== Subhuman and inferior races in Nazi Germany ===

The racial policies of Nazi Germany, the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, and the racist doctrines of Adolf Hitler considered Jews, Roma and Slavs, including Poles, Czechs, Russians and Serbs, &quot;racially inferior sub-humans&quot; (); the term was also applied to &quot;Mischling&quot; (persons of mixed &quot;Aryan&quot; and non-Aryan, such as Jewish, ancestry) and black people.

=== Connotation of the term Aryan in Nazi racial theories ===

A definition of Aryan that included all non-Jewish Europeans was deemed unacceptable, and the Expert Committee on Questions of Population and Racial Policy of 1933 brought together important Nazi intellectuals Alfred Ploetz, Fritz Thyssen, and Ernst Rüdin to plan the course of Nazi racial policy, defining an Aryan as one who was &quot;tribally related to the German blood and descendant of a &quot;Volk&quot;&quot;. The term &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; was used by Nazis to indicate &quot;ethnic Germans&quot; who did not hold German Reich citizenship; &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; further consist of &quot;racial groups&quot;—minorities within a state—who are descendants of a &quot;Volk&quot; domiciled in Europe in a closed tribal settlement and are closely related to German racial community. The Nazi concept of &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; racially unified ethnic Germans, including those living outside the German Reich, propounding only the members of the racial community be considered Aryan.

Members of the SS deemed Aryans could be selected from populations of &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; across Europe to create &quot;master race&quot;. Nazi Party established the organization NSDAP/AO to disseminate Nazi propaganda among the ethnic German minorities considered &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; in central and eastern Europe. Nazi racial theories considered the &quot;purest stock of Aryans&quot; the Nordic people, identified by physical anthropological features such as tallness, white skin, blue eyes, narrow and straight noses, doliocephalic skulls, prominent chins, and blond hair, including Scandinavians, Germans, English and French, with Nordic and Germanic people being the &quot;master race&quot; (). Recent archaeogenetic studies contradict these ideas, and instead suggest that Proto-Indo-European speaking peoples probably had brown eyes and hair, and intermediate skin complexion.

=== Historical revisionism ===
After the death of Kossinna, Heinrich Himmler, and other Nazi figures such as Alfred Rosenberg, adopted his nationalistic theories of Germanic peoples and methodologies, including settlement archaeology, and founded the SS organization Ahnenerbe () for conducting archaeological investigations of a presumed &quot;Germanic expansion in pre-history&quot;. Nazi scholars endorsed the now-discredited North European hypothesis in an effort to prove PIE was originally spoken by an &quot;Aryan master race&quot;, and associated the Semitic languages with &quot;inferior races&quot;. Historical revisionism around race was disseminated through the Nazi think tank Ahnenerbe. Hitler regularly invoked Social Darwinist concepts of Ernst Haeckel such as higher evolution (), struggle for existence (), selection (), struggle for life (), in his Nazi racial ideology, which is the central theme in the chapter &quot;Nation and Race&quot; of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. Haeckel&#x27;s Social Darwinism was also praised by Alfred Ploetz, founder of the German Society for Racial Hygiene, who made him an honorary member of the eugenic organization.

=== Nazi eugenics and Nordic supremacy ===
In 1938, the Reich Ministry of Education released the German biology curriculum which reflected the curriculum developed by the National Socialist Teachers League and emphasized the Social Darwinst interpretation of the evolution of human races. Hans Weinert, who had joined the SS and worked for the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology publishing theories of Nazi eugenics and racial evolution, claimed the Nordic race as a highly evolved race, and Aboriginal Australians as being the lowest rank in the racial hierarchy. Hans F. K. Günther was considered to be the most influential Nazi anthropologist, although he was not professionally trained. Günther&#x27;s racist writings on Nordicism was suffused with the ideas of Gobineau, who believed the Nordic race had originated in northern Europe and spread through conquest; this had expressed approval of the Nazi eugenics policies and had critical influence on scientific racism. Günther&#x27;s theories gained acclamation from Hitler, who later included his books as a recommended reading material for the Nazi Party members. After the Nazis came to power, selective breeding for supposed Aryan traits such as athleticism, blond hair and blue eyes was encouraged, while the &quot;inferior races&quot; and people with physical or mental illness were deemed &quot;life unworthy of life&quot; () and many were interned in concentration camps.

=== Ethnic cleansing and the Holocaust ===

The culmination of Nazi eugenicist and racial hygiene programs of sterilization and extermination aimed at creating an &quot;Aryan master race&quot; and eliminating &quot;inferior non-Aryan types&quot; such as Jews, Slavs, Poles, Roma, homosexuals, and the disabled. Nazi Germany introduced the Anti-Jewish legislation that systemically discriminated against Jews by requiring Aryan certification for a German Reich citizen. After Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany, the public policies of Nazi Germany became increasingly hostile towards supposed &quot;inferior types&quot;, particularly Jews, who were considered to be the highest manifestation of the Semitic race, and segregation of Jews in ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the Final Solution to the Jewish Question. The state-sponsored persecution systematically murdered over 6 million Jews, 5.7 million Slavs, 1.8–3 million Poles, 270,000 disabled people, among other victims, including children through mass shooting, gas chamber, gas van, and concentration camps, in the process known as the Holocaust. The ethnic Germans considered &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; joined the local SS organizations under NSDAP/AO and participated in Nazi-sponsored pogroms in eastern and central Europe during the Holocaust, including seizures of Jewish property. The Aryan race belief was used by the Nazis to justify the persecution, depicting the victims as the &quot;antipode and eternal enemy of the Aryans&quot;.

== White supremacy ==

Following Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, various neo-Nazi and racial nationalist movements developed a more inclusive definition of Aryan claiming to Western European peoples, with Nordic and Germanic peoples being the most &quot;racially pure&quot;. However, in the United States, most white nationalists define whiteness broadly as people of European ancestry, and some consider Jews to be white although this is controversial within white nationalist circles.

Many white supremacist neo-Nazi groups and prison gangs, notably in the United States, view themselves as part of an Aryan race, including the Aryan Brotherhood, Aryan Nations, Aryan Guard, Aryan Republican Army, White Aryan Resistance, Aryan Circle, Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, and others.

== Neo-pagan movements ==

Indo-European history, real and feigned, plays a significant role in various neo-pagan movements.

=== Russian neo-paganism ===

The Russian Slavophile movements borrowed various discrete ideas of a presumed &quot;prestigious Aryan origin&quot; of Europeans from Nazi Germany. Although Russian Orthodoxy was the primary religious influence on Russian nationalists, the primacy of Christianity was treated skeptically by these groups, who later began searching for an ancient text to rationalize a &quot;return to the origins&quot;. Various writers in the newspaper &quot;Zhar-Ptitsa&quot; showed interest in a purported manuscript—the Book of Veles—which supposedly dated to the first century BCE. F. A. Izenbek, a White Army officer, alleged the discovery of this manuscript during the Russian Civil War. However one of Izenbek&#x27;s friends, Iurii Miroliubov, had forged the manuscript, and used the term &quot;Vedism&quot; to describe Russian neo-paganism; he later appropriated the Indian religious scripture, the Vedas, to aggrandize the manuscript. Nationalistic white Russian émigrés and neo-Pagans consider the manuscript to be an authentic historical source of Slavic antiquity, who claim a direct link between &quot;ancient Aryans&quot; and themselves as Slavs. However, the manuscript is declared literary forgery by scholars. Alexey Dobrovolsky, a Russian neo-Nazi, is considered the founding Nazi ideologues of Slavic Neopaganism.

=== Goddess movement ===
With the rise of first-wave feminism, various authors of the Goddess movement cast the ancient Indo-Europeans as a &quot;patriachal, warlike invaders who destroyed a utopian prehistoric world of feminine peace and beauty&quot; in various archaeological dramas and books such as Riane Eisler&#x27;s &quot;The Chalice and the Blade&quot; (1987) and Marija Gimbutas&#x27;s &quot;Civilization of the Goddess&quot; (1991).

<text>Joseph Sepp Blatter (born Josef Blatter; 10 March 1936) is a Swiss former football administrator who served as the eighth president of FIFA from 1998 to 2015. He has been banned from participating in FIFA activities since 2015 as a result of the FIFA corruption case made public that year, and will remain banned until 2027.

From a background in business, public relations, and sports administration, Blatter became general secretary of FIFA in 1981 and was then elected president at the 51st FIFA Congress on 8 June 1998, succeeding João Havelange, who had headed the organization since 1974. Blatter was re-elected in 2002, 2007, 2011, and 2015. Like his predecessor Havelange, Blatter built his power base in FIFA by increasing the influence of numerous African and Asian countries in world football through the expansion of participating teams in various FIFA tournaments, culminating in the highly controversial awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, a Gulf oil state of 3,000,000 people with little footballing culture. Under Blatter&#x27;s leadership as president, eleven of the 22 committee members who voted on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments were fined, suspended, banned for life or prosecuted for corruption, including Blatter. Although he has persistently been dogged by claims of corruption and financial mismanagement, Blatter&#x27;s reign oversaw a vast expansion in revenues generated by the FIFA World Cup accompanied by the collapse of the marketing company International Sport and Leisure and numerous allegations of corruption in the bidding processes for the awarding of FIFA tournaments.

On 2 June 2015, six days after the United States government indicted several current and former FIFA officials and sports marketing companies for bribery and money laundering, Blatter announced that he would call for elections to choose a new president of FIFA and that he would not stand in these elections, but he also said he would remain in his position until an extraordinary FIFA Congress could be held for his successor to be elected. Criminal proceedings were announced against Blatter by the Swiss Attorney General&#x27;s office on 25 September 2015, regarding &quot;criminal mismanagement... and misappropriation&quot;.

In October 2015, Blatter and other top FIFA officials were suspended amid the investigation, and in December the independent FIFA Ethics Committee ejected Blatter from office and banned him from taking part in any FIFA activities over the following eight years. On 24 February 2016, a FIFA appeals committee upheld the suspension but reduced it from eight years to six. On 24 March 2021, he received a second ban for six years and was fined the amount of CHF 1,000,000 by the body&#x27;s Ethics Committee after a probe into massive bonus payments. Issa Hayatou served as the acting President of FIFA until an extraordinary FIFA Congress was held in late February, electing Gianni Infantino as the 9th president of FIFA.

== Early life ==
Blatter was born in Visp in the Swiss canton of Valais with the given name of &quot;Josef&quot;. He studied in Saint Maurice, before getting a degree in business and economics from the University of Lausanne in 1959. Blatter has had a long and varied career, including posts such as head of public relations for the tourist board of his native canton, as well as general secretary of the Swiss Ice Hockey Federation.

Blatter was Director of Sports Timing and Relations of Longines S.A., and was involved in the organization of the 1972 and 1976 Olympic Games.

== FIFA ==
From 1975 onwards, Blatter worked at FIFA, first as technical director (1975–1981), then general secretary (1981–1998), before his election as FIFA president in 1998. He was re-elected as head of FIFA in 2002, and was re-elected unopposed for another four years on 31 May 2007, even though only 66 of 207 FIFA members nominated him.

Blatter and FIFA were often dogged by controversy and allegations of corruption. His tenure saw controversy over allegations of financial mismanagement and the acceptance of bribes resulting in Qatar&#x27;s successful 2022 World Cup bid.

Blatter has attracted criticism from the media, senior football figures and players, due to controversial statements. These include the claim that Latin American countries would applaud John Terry for having an extramarital affair, and that on-field racism could be corrected with a handshake, among others. He also drew criticism at the 2014 FIFA World Cup seeding, when he interrupted a &quot;one-minute silence&quot; for former South-African president Nelson Mandela, who died the day before, after eleven seconds. Michael van Praag, the chairman of the Royal Dutch Football Association, called his behavior &quot;preposterous&quot; and expressed the hope Blatter would not be reelected in 2015.

Blatter has been publicly heckled, at the World Cup in Seoul and the Confederations Cup in Frankfurt, both in 2002 and 2005, in his home town of Visp in 2011, at the 2012 Women&#x27;s Olympic Football Final Medal Ceremony, and at the opening of Confederations Cup match in 2013. In order to avoid protest, no speeches were given at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

=== 1998 election ===

Blatter&#x27;s 1998 election to the presidency of FIFA over UEFA President Lennart Johansson occurred amidst much controversy. Blatter&#x27;s 2002 candidacy was marked with rumours of financial irregularities and backroom dealings, culminating with direct accusations of bribery, by a third party, made in the British press by Farra Ado, vice-president of the Confederation of African Football and president of the Somali Football Federation, who claimed to have been offered $100,000 to vote for Blatter in 1998.

=== 2004 comments on women&#x27;s football ===
In 2004, Blatter said during an interview in the Swiss newspaper Sonntagsblick, when asked how to increase the popularity of women&#x27;s football, &quot;Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball. They could, for example, have tighter shorts. Female players are pretty, if you excuse me for saying so, and they already have some different rules to men - such as playing with a lighter ball. That decision was taken to create a more female aesthetic, so why not do it in fashion?&quot; His comments resulted in heated responses.

=== 2006 FIFA World Cup ===
In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, after a controversial second-round match between Portugal and the Netherlands, which saw referee Valentin Ivanov issue a record 16 yellow cards and four red cards, Blatter was said to have lambasted the officiating referee, and said that Ivanov should have given himself a yellow card for his poor performance as a referee. He later said he regretted his words and promised to officially apologise to Ivanov. The apology was never given, and the referee was removed from further officiating.
=== Foreign &#x27;over-representation&#x27; on club teams ===
Blatter was criticized in 2007 and 2008 for trying to change European Union employment law regarding the number of foreign players that football clubs could field at any one time. His plans were to set a restriction of five foreign players and having six players from the said team&#x27;s own nationality. Blatter believed this would help the countries&#x27; national sides by having more national players playing in their leagues.

Blatter has often referred to the English Premier League as one of the major problems in football and used it as an example, due to the influence of foreign players, coaches and owners in the top teams.

=== World Cup&#x27;s chosen sites ===

It was reported that Blatter had &quot;cut an unofficial deal with UEFA head Michel Platini&quot; to ensure Europe would receive the 2018 World Cup, such that if the non-European bids did not withdraw from 2018 &quot;they will find themselves frozen out and not given any backing by the FIFA High Command, damaging their chances of being serious contenders for the second tournament.&quot;

Eleven bids were submitted in March 2009 covering 13 nations. Mexico and Indonesia withdrew. Five of the remaining nine bids—South Korea, Qatar, Japan, Australia and the United States—were only for the 2022 World Cup, while all the others were bidding for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Because all of the bids for the 2018 World Cup were from European nations, and FIFA&#x27;s rules dictate that countries belonging to confederations that hosted either of the two preceding tournaments are not eligible to host, the bids of England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium and Spain/Portugal were forced to be for 2018 only.

=== Technological assistance ===
The criticism attracted by Blatter&#x27;s refusal to allow goal-line technology or video replays intensified following the controversial Frank Lampard disallowed goal in the match between England and Germany on 27 June 2010.

Two days later, Blatter stated that he deplored the &quot;evident referee mistakes&quot; in the England v Germany and Mexico v Argentina matches, and apologised to the English Football Association and the Mexican Football Federation (the two organizations directly concerned by the referees&#x27; mistakes), acknowledging that Lampard had indeed scored against Germany and that Tévez&#x27;s goal against Mexico had been scored from an offside position.

He added: &quot;It is obvious that after the experiences so far at this World Cup it would be a nonsense not to re-open the file on goal-line technology. […] We will come out with a new model in November on how to improve high level referees. […] I cannot disclose more of what we are doing but something has to be changed.&quot;

=== 2011 FIFA presidential election ===
In 2011, elections were scheduled for the FIFA presidency, in which Blatter was again the incumbent candidate, running for a fourth consecutive term. The ChangeFIFA organisation, on 29 March 2011, endorsed former Chilean defender and for three years running South American Footballer of the Year Elías Figueroa as candidate for the presidency, urging national federations to nominate him, but, subsequently, Figueroa decided not to accept the nomination, stating that &quot;in such a short period of time&quot; he could not develop a case &quot;worthy of the magnitude and importance of such a distinguished job&quot;

The vote took place at the 61st FIFA Congress in Zurich. The only other candidate, Mohammed bin Hammam of Qatar, withdrew from the presidential race on 28 May, just before the vote. Bin Hammam had supported Blatter&#x27;s 1998 and 2002 presidential campaigns, but admitted that he had fallen out with Blatter over issues within the FIFA Executive Committee. The FIFA ethics committee that investigated bribery claims against Bin Hammam and CONCACAF head Jack Warner announced that Blatter will not face an investigation into claims that he knew of the bribery and did nothing about it, because of a lack of evidence.

Blatter criticised the International Olympic Committee (IOC), stating FIFA manage their finances &quot;like a housewife&quot;, after the IOC announced it would look into allegations of corruption against Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football.

There being no other nominations, Blatter ran unopposed in the ensuing presidential election and was re-elected for a fourth term, with 186 of the 203 votes cast. In his campaign, Blatter had stipulated that, if re-elected in 2011, he would not run again for president. Blatter received criticism for not postponing his 2011 election in which his term as FIFA President was extended through 2015, despite the fact that all other candidates for the role had been suspended or withdrew.

=== Allegations of financial mismanagement ===
Amidst internal divisions, FIFA&#x27;s secretary-general Blatter&#x27;s deputy and former protégé Michel Zen-Ruffinen drew up a 30-page dossier outlining allegations of financial mismanagement within the organisation. The dossier alleged that the collapse of FIFA&#x27;s marketing partner ISL had led to losses of up to 100 million US dollars under Blatter&#x27;s management.

The allegations were backed by Johansson, and the dossier was handed to the Swiss authorities, but they cleared Blatter of any wrongdoing and FIFA had to pay all the costs. An internal investigation within FIFA was halted by Blatter because members of it broke confidentiality agreements. This questionable behaviour led him to remove Zen-Ruffinen from office immediately before the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

In April 2012 the Council of Europe published a report which stated it would be &quot;difficult to imagine&quot; that Blatter would have been unaware of &quot;significant sums&quot; paid to unnamed FIFA officials by ISSM/ISL in connection with lucrative contracts for World Cup television rights and the subsequent bankruptcy and collapse of ISL in 2001. The Council of Europe report will be considered by over 300 parliamentarians from the 47 Council of Europe member states in Strasbourg.

=== Awarding of 2018 and 2022 World Cup ===

Controversy came in the British press when Russia was awarded the 2018 event, with England receiving just two of their &quot;promised&quot; votes; this controversy was dismissed by Blatter as the English showing themselves to be &quot;bad losers&quot;. The awarding of the 2022 games to Qatar was also controversial. The illegality of homosexuality in the nation caused Blatter to joke that &quot;I would say they [gay fans] should refrain from any sexual activities&quot;, which brought criticism from retired basketball player John Amaechi and gay rights groups.

=== 2013 FIFA Ethics Committee investigation ===
On 29 April 2013, FIFA&#x27;s Ethics Committee concluded its investigation into allegations of illegal payments to FIFA officials from the organisation&#x27;s former marketing partner International Sports and Leisure (ISL), which went bankrupt in 2001, and published its report.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter was cleared of any misconduct, but his predecessor, Brazilian João Havelange, resigned as FIFA&#x27;s honorary president over his part in the scandal, since Havelange along with former FIFA Executive Committee members Ricardo Teixeira and Dr. Nicolás Leoz were found to have accepted illegal payments between 1992 and May 2000. A week before FIFA&#x27;s ethics committee announced its findings, 84-year-old Leoz had resigned from his post as president of the South American Football Confederation, citing &quot;health reasons&quot;.

Blatter, in a statement, &quot;note[d] with satisfaction&quot; that the report &quot;confirms that &#x27;President Blatter&#x27;s conduct could not be classified in any way as misconduct with regard to any ethics rules&#x27;.&quot; He added he has &quot;no doubt that FIFA, thanks to the governance reform process that [Blatter] proposed now has the mechanisms and means to ensure that such an issue does not happen again&quot;, though admitting that the scandal &quot;has caused untold damage to the reputation of [FIFA].&quot;

===2015 FIFA presidential election, controversy and resignation ===
In 2015, elections were scheduled for the FIFA presidency, in which Blatter was again the incumbent candidate, running for a fifth consecutive term. Prince Ali bin Hussein was his opponent in the election.

The vote took place at the 65th FIFA Congress in Zürich on 29 May 2015. Neither party received the necessary two-thirds majority of votes from the first round with Blatter receiving 133 to Prince Ali&#x27;s 73. According to FIFA rules, a second round should have been held for the two candidates, with a simple majority being sufficient for victory. However, before the second round of voting commenced, Prince Ali announced his withdrawal, handing Blatter victory by default.

On 2 June 2015, FIFA abruptly called a press conference at their Zürich headquarters, where Blatter announced that he would resign from the post of FIFA president amid the ongoing corruption scandal.

During the news conference he said: &quot;My mandate does not appear to be supported by everybody&quot; and announced an extraordinary congress scheduled &quot;as soon as possible&quot; to elect his successor. Blatter announced that he would remain in office until his successor could be elected at the extraordinary congress, likely to be held some time between December 2015 and March 2016. He continued with the words: &quot;While I have a mandate from the membership of FIFA, I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football—the fans, the players, the clubs, the people who live, breathe, and love football as much as we all do at FIFA&quot;.

Subsequently, on 26 June Blatter prompted speculation that he might be preparing to renege on this resignation, when he was quoted as saying that &quot;I have not resigned, I put my mandate in the hands of an extraordinary congress&quot;. This seemed to contradict his comments from 2 June 2015. He was further quoted as saying that he resigned &quot;to take away the pressure from FIFA and my employees, including [pressure] from the sponsors&quot;. Reports speculated that it appears that Blatter will step down at the &quot;extraordinary congress&quot; though the situation remains vague.

On 25 September, Swiss investigators announced that they were investigating Blatter in relation to payments made to UEFA president Michel Platini. While Blatter and Platini denied any impropriety around the payments, major FIFA sponsors Coca-Cola, Visa Inc., McDonald&#x27;s, and Budweiser issued public statements requesting that he resign for the good of FIFA.

On 8 October 2015, he was suspended from FIFA for 90 days while investigations into payments made to Michel Platini were conducted. FIFA said in a statement: &quot;The grounds for these decisions are the investigations that are being carried out by the investigatory chamber of the ethics committee.&quot; On 21 December, FIFA&#x27;s ethics committee banned both Blatter and Platini from football for eight years. In February 2016, a FIFA appeals committee upheld the suspension but reduced it from eight years to six. Platini appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which rejected his appeal.

On 22 December 2020, FIFA filed a criminal complaint against Blatter relating to his role in the FIFA Museum project.

On 24 March 2021, he received a second ban for six years and was fined the amount of CHF 1,000,000 by the body&#x27;s Ethics Committee after a probe into massive bonus payments.

On 2 November 2021, Blatter was formally charged by Swiss authorities for fraud and falsifying documents in connection with the improper payments to Platini. Blatter and Platini were cleared of the charges eight months later.

===Post FIFA ===
Blatter has been critical of football&#x27;s leadership since his departure from FIFA, specifically criticising FIFA president Gianni Infantino and UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin. Blatter noted that when he had started working in FIFA, the organization was poor and was not the powerhouse it is today and admits he played a major role in the commercialisation of football, which has led to an increase in non-sports sponsors. Blatter stated that awarding the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar was a mistake. Blatter has been critical of the expansion and creation of tournaments like the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Conference League, FIFA Club World Cup, and UEFA Nations League and has warned that oversaturation, rising costs, and fan violence could cause interest in football to drop. Blatter also criticised the awarding of the 2030 FIFA World Cup to six countries in three continents (Argentina, Morocco, Paraguay, Portugal, Spain, and Uruguay), stating the tournament would lose its identity. Blatter also criticised the 2034 FIFA World Cup in Saudi Arabia, saying that it would go against the human rights and democracy that make up FIFA&#x27;s values as well as the bidding process for both 2030 and 2034 that was designed to favor Saudi Arabia.

==Sexual assault allegation==
In November 2017, American goalkeeper Hope Solo accused Blatter of sexual assault at the FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or awards in 2013. During an interview with the Portuguese newspaper &quot;Expresso&quot;, Solo stated she &quot;had Sepp Blatter grab my ass&quot; just before the two presented an award together to Abby Wambach. She stated she &quot;was in shock and completely thrown off. I had to quickly pull myself together to present my team-mate with the biggest award of her career and celebrate with her in that moment, so I completely shifted my focus to Abby.&quot; Blatter&#x27;s spokesman Thomas Renggli stated &quot;This allegation is ridiculous.&quot;

== Honours ==

Blatter has been the recipient of numerous awards, medals, honorary degrees, and citizenships from nation states, sport governing bodies, special interest groups, universities and cities.

Blatter&#x27;s honorary degree from De Montfort University was revoked by the institution in October 2015, as it had previously been given in recognition of his ethical conduct.

== Personal life ==
In 1981, Blatter changed the spelling of his first name from Josef to Joseph. He later adopted his nickname, Sepp, as his middle name.

Blatter&#x27;s first wife was Liliane Biner. The couple had a daughter, shortly after which they divorced. In 1981, Blatter married Barbara Käser, the daughter of Helmut Käser, Blatter&#x27;s predecessor as secretary general of FIFA. Their marriage lasted ten years until Barbara died from complications after an operation. In 1995, Blatter began dating Ilona Boguska, a Polish friend of his daughter Corinne, before they separated in 2002.

Blatter married for a third time on 23 December 2002, to Graziella Bianca, a dolphin trainer who was a friend of his daughter. Their marriage ended in divorce in 2004. Since 2014, he has been in a domestic partnership with Linda Barras.

Blatter was raised as a Catholic.

<doc id="42279" wikidata="Q211028" url="?curid=42279" title="Bass drum">
<text>The bass drum is a large drum that produces a note of low definite or indefinite pitch. The instrument is typically cylindrical, with the drum&#x27;s diameter usually greater than its depth, with a struck head at both ends of the cylinder. The heads may be made of calfskin or plastic and there is normally a means of adjusting the tension, either by threaded taps or by strings. Bass drums are built in a variety of sizes, but size does not dictate the volume produced by the drum. The pitch and the sound can vary much with different sizes, but the size is also chosen based on convenience and aesthetics. Bass drums are percussion instruments that vary in size and are used in several musical genres. Three major types of bass drums can be distinguished.

* The type usually seen or heard in orchestral, ensemble or concert band music is the orchestral, or concert bass drum (in Italian: gran cassa, gran tamburo). It is the largest drum of the orchestra.
* The kick drum, a term for a bass drum associated with a drum kit, which is much smaller than the above-mentioned bass drum. It is struck with a beater attached to a pedal, usually seen on drum kits.
* The pitched bass drum, generally used in marching bands and drum corps, is tuned to a specific pitch and is usually played in a set of three to six drums.

In many forms of music, the bass drum is used to mark or keep time. The bass drum makes a low, boom sound when the mallet hits the drumhead. In marches, it is used to project tempo (marching bands historically march to the beat of the bass). A basic beat for rock and roll has the bass drum played on the first and third beats of bars in common time, with the snare drum on the second and fourth beats, called backbeats. In jazz, the bass drum can vary from almost entirely being a timekeeping medium to being a melodic voice in conjunction with the other parts of the set.

==Etymology==
Bass drums have many synonyms and translations, such as &quot;gran cassa&quot; (It), &quot;grosse caisse&quot; (Fr), &quot;Grosse Trommel&quot; or &quot;Basstrommel&quot; (Ger), and &quot;bombo&quot; (Sp).

==History==

The earliest known predecessor to the bass drum was the Turkish davul, a cylindrical drum that featured two thin heads. The heads were stretched over hoops and then attached to a narrow shell. To play this instrument, a person would strike the right side of the davul with a large wooden stick, while the left side would be struck with a rod. When struck, the davul produced a sound much deeper than that of the other drums in existence. Because of this unique tone, davuls were used extensively in war and combat, where a deep and percussive sound was needed to ensure that the forces were marching in proper step with one another. The military bands of the Ottoman Janissaries in the 18th century were one of the first groups to utilize davuls in their music; Ottoman marching songs often had a heavy emphasis on percussion, and their military bands were primarily made up of davul, cymbal and kettle drum players.

Davuls were ideal for use as military instruments because of the unique way in which they could be carried. The Ottoman janissaries, for example, hung their davuls at their breasts with thick straps. This made it easier for the soldiers to carry their instruments from battle to battle. This practice does not seem to be limited to just the Ottoman Empire, however; in Egypt, drums very similar to davuls were braced with cords, which allowed the Egyptian soldiers to carry them during military movements.

The davul, however, was also used extensively in non-military music. For example, davuls were a major aspect of Turkish folk dances. In Ottoman society, davul and shawm players would perform together in groups called davul-zurnas, or drum and shawm circles.

*Long drums

At its peak, the Ottoman Empire stretched from Vienna down to northern Africa and most of the middle east. This long reach meant that many aspects of Ottoman culture, including the davul and other janissary instruments, were likely introduced to other parts of the world. In Africa, the indigenous population took the basic idea of the davul – that is, a two-headed cylindrical drum that produces a deep sound when struck – and both increased the size of the drum and changed the material from which it was made, leading to the development of the long drum. The long drum can be made in a variety of different ways but is most typically constructed from a hollowed-out tree trunk. This is vastly different from the davul, which is made from a thick shell. Long drums were typically 2 meters in length and 50 centimeters in diameter, much larger than the Turkish drums on which they were based. The indigenous population also believed that the tree from which the long drum was made had to be in perfect shape. Once an appropriate tree was selected and the basic frame for the long drum was constructed, the Africans took cow hides and soaked them in boiling hot water, in order to stretch them out. Although the long drum was an improvement on the davul, both drums were nevertheless played in a similar fashion. Two distinct sticks were used on the two distinct sides of the drum itself. A notable difference between the two is that long drums, unlike davuls, were used primarily for religious purposes.

*Gong drums

As the use of the long drum began to spread across Europe, many composers and musicians started looking for even deeper tones that could be used in compositions. As a result of this demand, a narrow-shelled, single-headed drum called the gong drum was introduced in Britain during the 19th century. This drum, which was 70-100 centimeters in diameter and deep-shelled, was similar to the long drum in both size and construction. When struck, the gong drum produced a deep sound with a rich resonance. However, the immense size of the drum, coupled with the fact that there was not a second head to help balance the sound, meant that gong drums tended to produce a sound with a definite pitch. As a result, they fell out of favor with many composers, as it became nearly impossible to incorporate them in an orchestra in any meaningful way.

*Orchestral bass drums and drum kits

Because they were unable to be used by orchestras, music makers began to build smaller gong drums that would not carry a definite pitch. This smaller version of the gong drum is today called the orchestral bass drum, and it is the prototype with which people are most familiar today. The modern bass drum is used primarily in orchestras. The drum, similar to the davul and long drum, is double-headed, rod tensioned and measures roughly 40 inches in diameter and 20 inches in width. Most orchestral bass drums are situated within a frame, which allows them to be positioned at any angle.

Bass drums are also highly visible in modern drum kits. In 1909, William Ludwig created a workable bass drum pedal, which would strike a two-headed bass drum in much the same way as a drumstick. During the 1960s, many rock ‘n’ roll drummers began incorporating more than one bass drum in their drum kit, including the Who&#x27;s Keith Moon and Cream&#x27;s Ginger Baker.

==Classical music==
In classical music, composers have much more freedom in the way the bass drum is used than in other genres of music. Common uses are:
*Providing local &quot;colour&quot;
*Climactic single strokes
*Rolls
*Adding weight to loud tutti sections

Apart from the standard beaters mentioned above, implements used to strike the drum may include keyboard percussion mallets, timpani mallets, and drumsticks. The hand or fingers can also be used (it. con la mano). The playing techniques possible include rolls, repetitions and unison strokes. Bass drums can sometimes be used for sound effects. e.g. thunder, or an earthquake.

===Mounting===
Bass drums are too large to be handheld and are always mounted in some way. The usual ways of mounting a bass drum are:
*Using a shoulder harness so that the heads are vertical
*On a floor stand as part of a drum kit. The heads are always vertical when mounted in this way.
*On an adjustable cradle. In this situation, the heads may be adjusted to any position between vertical and horizontal.
*It is possible for the bass drum to have a single cymbal mounted on it

===Strikers===
Bass drums can have a variety of strikers depending on the music:
*A single heavy felt covered mallet (Fr. Mailloche; It. Mazza).
*When the drum is mounted vertically, the malet above may be held in one hand and a rute held in the other.
*2 matching bass drum mallets or a double headed mallet are used for playing drum rolls.
*When used as part of a drum kit, a variation of the mallet described above is mounted on a pedal and called a beater.

== Electronic music ==
In electronic music, bass drums, especially kick drums, are frequently used. Kick drum sounds are prominent in various music styles, including American genres like footwork and African genres such as gqom.

==Kit drumming==

In a drum kit, the bass drum is much smaller than in traditional orchestral use, most commonly in diameter. Sizes range from in diameter while depths range from , with being normal. Vintage bass drums are generally shallower than the current standard of .

Sometimes the front head of a kit bass drum has a hole in it to allow air to escape when the drum is struck for shorter sustain. Muffling can be installed through the hole without taking off the front head. The hole also allows microphones to be placed into the bass drum for recording and amplification. In addition to microphones, sometimes trigger pads are used to amplify the sound and provide a uniform tone, especially when fast playing without a decrease in volume is desired. Professional drummers often choose to have a customized bass drum front head, with the logo or name of their band on the front.

The kit bass drum may be more heavily muffled than the classical bass drum, and it is popular for drummers to use a pillow, blanket, or professional mufflers inside the drum, resting against the batter head, to dampen the blow from the pedal, and produce a shorter &quot;thud&quot;.

Different beaters have different effects, and felt, wood and plastic ones are all popular. Bass drums sometimes have a tom-tom mount on the top, to save having to use (and pay for) a separate stand or rack. Fastening the mount involves cutting a hole in the top of the bass drum to attach it; &quot;virgin&quot; bass drums do not have this hole cut in them, and so are professionally prized.

===Bass drum pedal===
In 1900, Sonor drum company introduced its first single bass drum pedal. William F. Ludwig made the bass drum pedal workable in 1909, paving the way for the modern drum kit. A bass drum pedal operates much the same as the hi-hat control; a footplate is pressed to pull a chain, belt, or metal drive mechanism downward, bringing a beater or mallet forward into the drumhead. The beater head is usually made of either felt, wood, plastic, or rubber and is attached to a rod-shaped metal shaft. The pedal and beater system are mounted in a metal frame and like the hi-hat, a tension unit controls the amount of pressure needed to strike and the amount of recoil upon release.

===Double bass drum pedal===
A double bass drum pedal operates much the same way as a single bass drum pedal does, but with a second footplate controlling a second beater on the same drum. Most commonly this is attached by a shaft to a remote beater mechanism alongside the primary pedal mechanism. One notable exception to this pattern is the symmetrical Sleishman twin bass drum pedal.

Alternatively, some drummers opt for two separate bass drums with a single pedal on each, for a similar effect.

===Drop-clutch===
When using a double bass drum pedal, the foot which normally controls the hi-hat pedal moves to the second bass drum pedal, and so the hi hat opens and remains open. A drop clutch can be used to keep the hi-hat in the closed position, even with the foot removed from the pedal.

===Pedal techniques===
There are 3 primary ways to play single strokes with one foot. The first is heel-down technique, where the player&#x27;s heel is planted on the pedal and the strokes are played with the ankle. This stroke is good for quiet playing and quick syncopated rhythms. The next technique is heel-up, where the player&#x27;s heel is lifted off of the pedal and the strokes originate from the hip. The ankle is still flexed with each stroke, but the full weight of the leg can be used to add additional power for louder playing situations. Lifting the heel allows access to several double stroke techniques as well. The third primary technique is the floating stroke where the heel is lifted off the pedal as in heel-up, but the stroke is played primarily from the ankle as in heel-down. This motion can allow greater speed and higher note density at louder volumes but is not efficient for slow tempos or sparse rhythms.

Drummers such as Thomas Lang, Virgil Donati, and Terry Bozzio are capable of performing complicated solos on top of an ostinato bass drum pattern. Thomas Lang, for example, has mastered the heel-up and heel-down (single- and double-stroke) to the extent that he is able to play dynamically with the bass drum and to perform various rudiments with his feet.

In order to play &quot;doubles&quot; on the pedal, drummers can employ 3 main techniques: slide, swivel, or heel-toe. In the slide technique, the pedal is struck around the middle area with the ball of the foot. As the drum produces a sound, the toe is slid up the pedal. After the first stroke, the pedal will naturally bounce back, hit the toe as it slides upwards, and rebound for a second strike. In the swiveling double, the pedal is struck once in the normal manner for the first note, then the heel is immediately rotated around the ball of the foot to the side of the pedal while simultaneously playing a second stroke. This rotation can be to the inside or outside, either will work, and results in a faster second stroke than is ordinarily possible. In the heel-toe technique the foot is suspended above the foot-board of the pedal. The entire foot is brought down and the ball of the foot strikes the pedal. The foot snaps up, the heel comes off the footboard, and the toes come down for a second stroke. Once mastered either technique allows the player to play very fast double strokes on the bass drum. Noted players include Rod Morgenstein, Tim Waterson (who formerly held the world record for the fastest playing on a bass drum, using double bass), Tomas Haake, Chris Adler, Derek Roddy, Danny Carey and Hellhammer. The technique is commonly used in death metal and other extreme forms of music where triggers and double bass are typically employed. Double strokes can only properly replace single strokes for long runs of evenly spaced notes when using triggers or sample replacement as the sound is inherently uneven. Some tempos are only possible with double strokes, however.

====Double bass drum====
In many forms of heavy metal and hard rock, as well as some forms of jazz, fusion, and punk, two bass drums are used, or alternatively two pedals on one bass drum. If two drums are used, that is often to give a more impressive appearance on large stages, but sometimes, the second drum is pitched differently to provide some variety in the notes, thus creating a more nuanced sound. The first person to use and popularize the double bass drum setup was jazz drummer Louie Bellson, who came up with the idea when he was still in high school. Ray McKinley was, by 1941, using this setup as well. Double bass drums were popularized in the 1960s by rock drummers Ringo Starr of The Beatles, Ginger Baker of Cream, Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Keith Moon of the Who and Nick Mason of Pink Floyd. After 1970, Billy Cobham and Narada Michael Walden used double kick drum with the jazz fusion project Mahavishnu Orchestra, Chester Thompson with Frank Zappa and Weather Report, Barriemore Barlow with Jethro Tull, and Terry Bozzio with Frank Zappa. For these genres the focus was &#x27;odd-meter grooves and mind blowing solos&#x27;. Double bass drumming later became an integral part of heavy metal, as pioneered by the likes of Les Binks, Carmine Appice, Ian Paice, Cozy Powell, Phil Taylor and Tommy Aldridge. American thrash metal band Slayer&#x27;s former drummer Dave Lombardo was named &quot;the godfather of double bass&quot; by the magazine &quot;Drummerworld&quot;. Later metal genres including death metal use double kick drumming extensively often with blast beat techniques, whilst focusing on precision, &#x27;endurance&#x27;, &#x27;speed&#x27; and &#x27;rapid footwork&#x27;.

Double bass drumming can be achieved with a number of techniques; most commonly, with simple alternating single strokes. However, in order to increase the speed, some drummers use the heel-toe technique; these are essentially double strokes where the drummer can perform two hits with one foot movement, which causes less fatigue at higher tempos.

Notable names that have a hand in raising the bar for double bass drumming, include: Terry Bozzio, Simon Philips, Virgil Donati, Derek Roddy, Gene Hoglan, George Kollias, Bobby Jarzombek and Tomas Haake. Bozzio introduced the ostinato in his &quot;Melodic Drumming and the Ostinato&quot; educational DVDs, playing various drum rudiments on the feet, while freely playing with the hands, creating polyrhythms. Donati is regarded as the first drummer to successfully use inverted double strokes with both feet, in addition to complex, syncopated ostinato patterns. Roddy, Hoglan and Kollias are acknowledged as the leaders of extreme metal drumming with their use of single strokes at 250+ beats per minute, while, Jarzombek and Haake&#x27;s double bass drumming influenced the djent genre.

The history and development of double bass (as well as notated playing instruction) can be traced in the books &quot;Encyclopedia of Double Bass Drumming &quot; written by Bobby Rondinelli and Michael Lauren and &quot;The Complete Double Bass Drumming Explained&quot; written by Ryan Alexander Bloom. In addition to these books, &quot;Double Bass Drumming&quot; written by Joe Franco and &quot;Double Bass Drum Freedom&quot; written by Virgil Donati are also commonly used resources for double bass instruction.

==In marching bands==
The &quot;bass line&quot; is a unique musical ensemble consisting of graduated pitch marching bass drums commonly found in marching bands and drum and bugle corps. Each drum plays a different note, and this gives the bass line a unique task in a musical ensemble. Skilled lines execute complex linear passages split among the drums to add an additional melodic element to the percussion section. This is characteristic of the marching bass drum—its purpose is to convey complex rhythmic and melodic content, not just to keep the beat. The line provides impact, melody, and tempo due to the nature of the sound of the instruments. The bass line usually has from as many as seven bass drums to as few as two. But most high school drumlines consist of between three and five.

===Components===
A bass line typically consists of four or five musicians, each carrying one tuned bass drum, although variations do occur. Smaller lines are not uncommon in smaller groups, such as some high school marching bands, and several groups have had one musician playing more than one bass drum, usually small ones, with one mounted on top of the other.

The drums are typically between 16&quot; and 32&quot; in diameter, but some groups have used bass drums as small as 14&quot; and larger than 36&quot;. The drums in a bass line are tuned such that the largest will always play the lowest note with the pitch increasing as the size of the drum decreases. Individually, the drums are usually tuned higher than other bass drums (drum set kick drums or orchestral bass drums) of the same size, so that complex rhythmic passages can be heard clearly and articulated.

Unlike the other drums in a drumline, the bass drums are generally mounted sideways, with the drumhead facing horizontally, rather than vertically. This results in several things. First of all, to ensure that a vibrating membrane is facing the audience, bass drummers must face perpendicular to the rest of the band and so are the only section in most groups whose bodies do not face the audience while playing. Consequently, bass drummers usually point their drums at the back of the bass drummer in front of them, so that the drum heads will all be lined up, from the audience&#x27;s point of view, next to one another in order to produce optimal sound output.

===Playing===

Since the bass drum is oriented differently from a snare or tenor drum, the stroke itself is different, but the fundamentals remain the same. The player&#x27;s forearms should be parallel to the ground and bent at the elbows. The line between their shoulder and elbow should be vertical and the mallet should be held upward at a 45-degree angle. The hands hold bass mallets in such a way as to place the center of the mallet in the center of the head. The mallet shaft bottom should be flush against the bottom part of the hand when playing, differing from other grips typical to percussion instruments.

The motion of the basic stroke is either similar to the motion of turning a doorknob, that is, an absolute forearm rotation, or similar to that of a snare drummer, where the wrist is the primary actor, or more commonly, a hybrid of these two strokes. Bass drum technique sees huge variation between different groups both in the ratio of forearm rotation to wrist turn and the differing views on how the hand works while playing. Some techniques also call for the use of fingers supporting the motion of the mallet by opening or closing, but no matter whether it is open or closed the thumb needs to be close to the rest of the fingers.

However, the basic stroke on a drum produces just one of the many sounds a bass line can produce. Along with the solo drum, the &quot;unison&quot; is one of the most common sounds used. It is produced when all of the bass drums play a note at the same time and with a balanced sound; this option has a very full, powerful sound. The rim click, which is when the shaft (near the mallet head) is struck against the rim of the drum, either solo or in unison. Rimshots are rare on a bass drum and usually only happen on the top drums.

The different positions of the typical five person bass line each require different skills, though not necessarily different levels of skills. Contrary to the popular belief that &quot;higher is better,&quot; each drum has its own critical role to play. Bottom, or fifth bass, is the largest, heaviest, and lowest drum in the drumline. Consequently, it is used frequently to help maintain pulse in an ensemble and is thus sometimes referred to as the &quot;heartbeat&quot; of the group (the bottom bass was also often referred to as the &quot;thud&quot; bass in days gone by, indicating that many of their notes were the last one at the end of a phrase). Although this player does not always play as many notes as fast as other bass drummers (the depth of pitch renders most complex passages indistinguishable from a roll), his or her role is essential not only to the sound of the bass line or the drum line, but to the ensemble as a whole, especially in the case of parade bands.

The fourth bass is slightly smaller than the bottom drum (generally smaller in diameter) and can function tonally similar to its lower counterpart, but usually plays slightly more rapid parts and is much more likely to play &quot;off the beat&quot; - in the middle rather than at the beginning or end of a passage. The third bass is the middle drum, both in terms of position and tone. Its function is usually that of the archetypical bass drum. This player plays an integral role in the actual rendering of complex linear passages. The second bass is known for having a job in the drumline. This player&#x27;s parts are very likely to be directly adjacent to the beginning or end of a phrase and less likely to be on a beat, which is highly counter-intuitive, especially to a new player. Sometimes this drum can function about the same as the top drum, but usually the second and top drummer function as a unit, playing rudimentarily difficult passages split between them.

Top, or first, bass is the highest pitched drum in the bass line and usually starts or ends phrases. The high tension drum heads allow this player to play notes that are just as taxing as those of the snare line, and often the top bass will play a part in unison with the snare line to add some depth to their sound. Some bass lines have more than five bass drums, with the largest being the largest number (bass 7 on a 7 bass line), and the smallest being referred to as first bass.

===Marching===

In a marching band&#x27;s field show, bass drummers typically face either goal line. It can be difficult to see the drum major and other players on the field when facing away from the center. For this reason, the players may turn to face the opposite direction during a show. Turns are typically done in unison or rippled for a different effect. 

With large bass drums, more strength and control is required to turn quickly. Achieving a clean turn requires the player to use large core muscles to stop momentum of the drum at the correct time and direction.

In some marching bands, the bass drum is used to give orders to the band. For example,
*One stroke is used to order the band (and associated troops) to start/stop marching
*Two strokes are used to order the band to stop marching
*Two strong strokes (Double Beat) are used when the music is due to cut off (usually a double beat then three beats and finish)

<doc id="42280" wikidata="Q93985" url="?curid=42280" title="Crash cymbal">
<text>A crash cymbal is a type of cymbal that produces a loud, sharp &quot;crash&quot; and is used mainly for occasional accents, as opposed to a ride cymbal. It can be mounted on a stand and played with a drum stick, or by hand in pairs. One or two crash cymbals are a standard part of a drum kit. Suspended crash cymbals are also used in bands and orchestras, either played with a drumstick or rolled with a pair of mallets to produce a slower, swelling crash. Sometimes a drummer may hit two different crash cymbals in a kit at the same time to produce a very loud accent, usually in rock music.

Although crash cymbals range in thickness from paper-thin to very heavy, all crash cymbals have a fairly thin edge. They are typically in diameter, but sizes down to and up to are manufactured. Custom crash cymbals up to in diameter have been used by big bands. Different thicknesses are used for different kinds of music, and the alloy for each manufacturer&#x27;s models varies. A thick cymbal is likely to be used by a metal or rock band, while thinner cymbals are generally used in lighter rock. Darker crashes are best used for jazz. 

The sound of a crash is changed by its luster. A cleaner cymbal creates a crisper sound, whereas a cymbal showing signs of oxidation (called a &#x27;raw&#x27; cymbal) creates a duller sound.

==Position==

Crash cymbals were traditionally placed on the left side of the drum set (for a right-handed drummer) since the normally larger ride cymbal is usually on the right, however some drummers set up their crash on the right. Often a drummer will have multiple crashes, and so may set them up with one or two on each side or, less commonly, one mounted very closely above another, usually larger crash or ride.


==Cracking==

Crash cymbals are often the first ones in a drum set to warp and ultimately crack, due to repeated striking of the edge. Cracking is generally in the form of a fracture along the edge, or across the bow, often originating from the edge. Cracks are caused by poor technique or excessive playing or more rarely as a result of a defect originating from manufacture or damage to the cymbal not caused by playing, for example dropping. If a crack is left untreated, it will begin to follow the lathe grooves around the cymbal and could potentially spread all the way around and back to the point where it started, causing the outer portion of a cymbal to simply drop off. Often, lower quality sheet cymbals are more likely to crack, due to stress caused in some areas by pressing sheet metal. Thicker cymbals are also more likely to crack due to their brittleness and less freedom to vibrate. Cymbal manufacturers suggest that wear on the cymbal can be reduced by playing with glancing blows, angled to the side and slightly away from the vertical, about a quarter of the way between the edge and the center and allowing the drum stick to bounce off naturally, rather than forcing the stick down at the cymbal head-on. This allows the cymbal to vibrate freely and for little stress to be caused on the edge or at the center hole, thus reducing the chance of a crack. Cracked cymbals are often fixed either temporarily or permanently by drilling a hole at either end of the crack (often the crack will spread further than it appears to the naked eye, so this method is often not as effective) or removing the cracked portion or cutting the cymbal&#x27;s edge down, although this method can drastically alter a cymbal&#x27;s sound. Both of these methods are often ineffective at stopping cracks, but usually slow the spread of a crack down.

==Orchestral crash cymbals==

A matching pair of crash cymbals played by striking the two together are known as clash cymbals. Clash cymbals are part of a standard orchestral percussion section. Two tones are normally used by major orchestras, known as &quot;Germanic&quot; or &quot;Wagnerian&quot; (heavier) and &quot;Viennese&quot; (lighter); a third, rarer tone is known as &quot;French&quot; (lighter still). Crash cymbals are also used in marching bands and wind ensembles.

<text>Inter mirifica ( in Latin), subtitled &quot;Decree on the Media of Social Communication&quot;, is one of the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s 16 magisterial documents.

The final text was approved on 24 November 1963 by a vote of 1,598 to 503. On 4 December 1963, it was promulgated by Pope Paul VI, after another vote, this time of 1,960 in favour and 164 opposed.

It is composed of 24 points, with the aim of addressing the concerns and problems of social communication. &quot;Inter mirifica&quot; identifies social communication as the press, cinema, television, and other similar types of communication interfaces.

The term &quot;social communications&quot;, apart from its more general use, has become the preferred term within documents of the Catholic Church for reference to media or mass media. It has the advantage, as a term, of wider connotation - all communication is social but not all communication is &quot;mass&quot;. In effect, though, the two terms are used synonymously.

==Historical background==
While &quot;Inter mirifica&quot; was one of the first decrees to reach a conclusion during Vatican II, the document itself went through many drafts, throughout its development. Over 70 drafts of &quot;Inter mirifica&quot; were prepared, yet out of all of these drafts, only nine were ready for final approval from the Vatican Council. The first draft &quot;Schema of a constitution on the Means of Social Communications&quot;, combined with the other six, were made into one volume by July 1962. This draft document consisted of an Introduction (nos 1–5), doctrines of the Church (6-33), the Apostolate of the Church in the field (34-48), the discipline and the ecclesiastical order (49-63), the different means of social communication (64-105), other means of Social Communication (106-111) and a conclusion (112-114). Although the discussion on &quot;Inter mirifica&quot; lasted for a short period (November 23–27, 1962), the document had a drastic change. The final draft, reduced to a quarter of its original length, which contains an introductory section, two short chapters and a conclusion.

==Themes of &quot;Inter mirifica&quot;==
* need for pastoral directive
* responsibility of the Church to monitor the use of social communications and media and ensure the spiritual well-being of the Church community at large
* responsibility of the individual to ensure their own well-being and to ensure they are not causing themselves &quot;spiritual harm&quot;
* responsibility of the media, including those involved in producing media

==Summary==

===Introduction (#1–2)===
# The Council states that, with God&#x27;s help, man has created many means of social communications. These means of social communication can be used to reach all types of people around the world, and can be used to educate and inform. The Catholic Church recognizes that if these tools of social communication be used properly, they can greatly benefit mankind. Reversely, if used improperly, they are incredibly detrimental. The authors state that &quot;Inter mirifica&quot; will look at the problematic issues of social media, and ways that the Church can fix these problems.

===Chapter One: On the Teaching of the Church (#3–12)===
# The authors of &quot;Inter mirifica&quot; state that it is within the Church&#x27;s birthright to use the means of social communication to the pursuit of preaching the gospel and of salvation.
# There are three questions of morality within social communications that the authors of the decree look at:
## The media has an obligation to provide correct, honest, and accurate news, as the Council believes that access to information, in relation to their circumstances, is a human right.
## There is a question of morality in the news. The Council insists that news may only be effectively delivered if the information provided is of a true moral order.
## While the Council states that at times information can be harmful as long as it is more profitable than harmful, it is necessary for said news to be heard.
# There is also a responsibility that lays upon different groups of people to ensure that what they are allowing themselves to listen to, watch, etc. is of good and sound morality. There is the obligation of the listener to avoid social communications that would cause &quot;spiritual harm&quot;. There is also the problem of youth, and ensuring that they receive information from social communications in moderation and under the supervision of teachers, parents, etc. Youth should be going to these educators with questions, but the educators should also be diligent in ensuring that what the youth are listening to are too of high morality.

===Chapter Two: On the Pastoral Activity of the Church (#13–22)===
# Chapter II of &quot;Inter mirifica&quot; showcases a positive view of media, as gifts of God and expresses the need for a healthy relationship between both parties. Because the Vatican Council sees that all forms of media (including radio, TV, newspaper and cinema) are very influential to all persons, the Council trusts that all media personnel will adhere to the teachings and desires of the Catholic Church (as described in Chapter one).
# There is a strong sense of responsibility and leadership that the Vatican Council expects all Church authorities to have. In doing so, all members of the Church are able to ensure a positive message of the Church in media, as well as a way for authorities to remove any harmful projects as well. These responsibilities include:
## The establishment of a Christian press.
## Bishops over-seeing media projects in their own dioceses.
## Teaching the Vatican&#x27;s ideas of the media and the Church, with younger age groups, within seminaries and Catholic schools.
# The overall relationship between the Catholic Church and the media, to the Vatican Council, is a way to help with the advancement of man&#x27;s being and their religious journey. Therefore, through the use of media, all individuals are able to learn about the teachings of the Catholic Church and move towards truth and goodness.

===Appendices (#23–24)===
# The Council states in its conclusion of &quot;Inter mirifica&quot; that it looks forward to a relationship between Catholic authorities and all media personnel, that will result in the use of social media and communication to reflect the council&#x27;s principles and rules. With their instruction, all members of the Catholic Church will be able to confidently accept these regulations, which will lead to the good of the Catholic mission and all of humanity.

==Effects and aftermath of &quot;Inter mirifica&quot;==
The document&#x27;s immediate reception was fairly negative. The document was heavily criticized for falling short of expectations, as well as failing to provide any new or different thoughts or instructions on social communications. At the close of the council, in a brief assessment of the documents it had produced, the &quot;New York Times&quot; said this text had been &quot;generally condemned as inadequate and too conservative&quot;. These sentiments have been the long-standing memories of the document, with these sentiments continuing 40 years following the decree.

However, the document did provide the beginning stages for further Church instructions on social communications, with the further documents of &quot;Communio et Progressio&quot; and &quot;Aetatis Novae&quot;. Furthermore, from the document emerged the World Communication Day (in full: World Social Communication Day), which was created by the Second Vatican Council, &quot;to draw the attention of her children and of all men of good will to the vast and complex phenomenon of the modem means of social communication, such as the press, motion pictures, radio and television, which form one of the most characteristic notes of modern civilization&quot;. Pope John Paul II vigorously promoted responsibility and positive goals in Social Communication not only in person but through messages given on this day and through supporting the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.

==Later documents==
As mentioned previously, in the follow-up and expansion of &quot;Inter mirifica&quot;, the document &quot;Communio et progressio&quot; was later written in 1971 as an update to &quot;Inter mirifica&quot;. A further document, &quot;Aetatis Novae&quot;, was published in 1992. In 2005, John Paul II wrote his final apostolic letter, &quot;The Rapid Development&quot;, on the topic of social communications

In his message &quot;The Priest and Pastoral Ministry in a Digital World: New Media at the Service of the Word&quot; to priests for the 44th World Communications Day (16 May 2010), Pope Benedict XVI called for them to become digital citizens and engage with the information society, saying, &quot;Priests stand at the threshold of a new era: as new technologies create deeper forms of relationship across greater distances, they are called to respond pastorally by putting the media ever more effectively at the service of the Word... Who better than a priest, as a man of God, can develop and put into practice, by his competence in current digital technology, a pastoral outreach capable of making God concretely present in today&#x27;s world and presenting the religious wisdom of the past as a treasure which can inspire our efforts to live in the present with dignity while building a better future?&quot;

<text>Dignitatis humanae (&quot;Of the Dignity of the Human Person&quot;) is the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s Declaration on Religious Freedom. In the context of the council&#x27;s stated intention &quot;to develop the doctrine of recent popes on the inviolable rights of the human person and the constitutional order of society&quot;, &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot; spells out the church&#x27;s support for the protection of religious liberty. It set the ground rules by which the church would relate to secular states.

The passage of this measure by a vote of 2,308 to 70 is considered by many to be one of the most significant events of the council. This declaration was promulgated by Pope Paul VI on December 7, 1965.

&quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot; became one of the key points of dispute between the Vatican and traditionalist Catholics such as Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre who argued that the council document was incompatible with previous authoritatively stated Catholic teaching.

==Background==

===Earlier Catholic view===
Historically, the ideal of Catholic political organization was a tightly interwoven structure of the Catholic Church and secular rulers generally known as Christendom, with the Catholic Church having a favoured place in the political structure. In 1520, Pope Leo X in the papal bull &quot;Exsurge Domine&quot; had censured the proposition &quot;That heretics be burned is against the will of the Spirit&quot; as one of a number of errors that were &quot;either heretical, scandalous, false, offensive to pious ears, or seductive of simple minds and against Catholic truth&quot;.

=== Late modern pre-Conciliar teaching ===
Following the French Revolution, the Papacy had found itself in a bitter clash against liberalism and revolutionary ideas: harsh anti-clerical measures such as the Civil Constitution of the Clergy had drawn harsh condemnation from the Holy See. The Magisterium was particularly concerned with the rise of indifferentism and relativism and the ideas of religious pluralism and freedom of conscience were seen as expression of both and were strongly rejected by several Pontiffs. 

Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, while reiterating traditional Catholic teaching, had also argued that “every man in the State may follow the will of God and, from a consciousness of duty and free from every obstacle, obey His commands” and that &quot;laws which impede this profession and practice of Faith are against natural law&quot;. John XXIII had made a distinction between “error as such” and the person in error, who preserves his dignity.

==Vatican II and religious freedom==

===Third session (1964)===
The debate on a separate Declaration on Religious Liberty was held on September 23 – September 25, as promised by Pope Paul the year before. However, in October an attempt was made by the Curial party to return this declaration to review by a special commission, which contained many hostile members and was outside the jurisdiction of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. Protest by bishops to Pope Paul resulted in the declaration staying under Unity with a different working commission which reviewed and amended it. 

===Fourth session (1965)===
This re-revised text was approved by the council on October 25, with only minor amendments allowed afterward (including some disliked by Murray). The final vote was taken and the declaration was promulgated at the end of council on December 7, 1965. The claim by some that this overwhelming majority was due to intense lobbying by the reformist wing of Council Fathers among those prelates who initially had reservations or even objections.

==Traditionalist Catholic reception==
Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre cited this document as one of the fundamental reasons for his difficulties with the Second Vatican Council. It remains a focus for attacks from Traditionalists in the 21st century. The Vatican&#x27;s position that the SSPX must acknowledge &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot; and &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; as authoritative remained a key point of difference between the two.

The Society of St. Pius X criticized how &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot; approached religious freedom with an argument from history: 
On the contradictions some see between &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot; and Pope Pius IX&#x27;s &quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot;, Brian Mullady has argued that:
==International Theological Commission, 2019==
On 21 March 2019, Pope Francis approved the publication of a document produced by the International Theological Commission called &quot;Religious freedom for the good of all: Theological approach to contemporary challenges&quot;. It attempts to update &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot; in the light of the increasing diversity and secularization seen since the Council: &quot;the cultural complexity of today&#x27;s civil order&quot;.

<text> (from Latin: &quot;In our time&quot;), or the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions, is an official declaration of the Vatican II, an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church. It was promulgated on 28 October 1965 by Pope Paul VI. Its name comes from its incipit, the first few words of its opening sentence, as is tradition. It passed the Council by a vote of 2,221 to 88 of the assembled bishops.

It is not a dogmatic document, the shortest of the 16 final documents of the Council and &quot;the first in Catholic history to focus on the relationship that Catholics have with Jews.&quot; Similarly, is considered a monumental declaration in describing the Church&#x27;s relationship with Muslims. It &quot;reveres the in all the major faith traditions.&quot; It begins by stating its purpose of reflecting on what humankind has in common in these times when people are being drawn closer together. The preparation of the document was largely under the direction of Cardinal Augustin Bea as President of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity, along with his &quot;periti&quot;, such as John M. Oesterreicher, Gregory Baum and Bruno Hussar.

Following an approach by Jules Isaac, a French-born Jew who was associated with the Seelisberg Conference of the International Council of Christians and Jews, in which he claimed that Christian antisemitism had prepared the way for the Holocaust, a sympathetic Pope John XXIII endorsed the creation of a document which would address a new, less adversarial approach to the relationship between the Catholic Church and Rabbinic Judaism. Within the Church, conservative Cardinals were suspicious and Middle Eastern Catholics strongly opposed the creation of such a document. With the Arab–Israeli conflict in full swing, the governments of the Arab world such as Egypt (in particular), Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq vocally lobbied against its development (the document was subjected to several leaks during its development due to the involvement of the intelligence agencies of several nations). Jewish organisations such as the American Jewish Committee, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, and the World Jewish Congress also lobbied for their side with the assistance of liberal clergymen.&lt;section end=Modern criticism of the Catholic Church transclusion/&gt; After going through numerous drafts, compromises were made and a statement was added on Islam to mollify the security concerns of the Arab Christians. Finally, statements on Eastern religions, Buddhism and Hinduism were also added.

==History of the document==
Before his death in 1963, Pope John XXIII wrote a statement which he intended to be read aloud in all Roman Catholic Churches of the world on a fixed date:
Originally, &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; was only supposed to focus on the relationship between the Catholic church and Judaism. There were five different drafts of the document before a final version was accepted. Some bishops and cardinals objected, including Middle Eastern bishops who were unsympathetic to the new state of Israel. Cardinal Bea decided to create a less contentious document which would stress ecumenism between the Catholic Church and all non-Christian faiths. While coverage of Hinduism and Buddhism is brief, two of the document&#x27;s five sections are devoted to Islam and Judaism.
===Before the Council: &quot;Decretum de Iudaeis&quot;, 1960–1962===
The specific origins of &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; can be traced directly to a meeting between Pope John XXIII and Jewish-French historian Jules Isaac on 13 June 1960. Isaac wanted a document at the Second Vatican Council, in light of the Holocaust, to specifically address the relationship between the Catholic Church and Judaism. In his meeting with Roncalli, Isaac used diplomatic language, pointing to the Fourth Chapter of the Catechism of the Council of Trent, in which Jews are mentioned in combination with the Romans as &quot;advisors and perpetrators of the passion&quot; and that the Catechism lays ultimate responsibility for the death of Jesus Christ, not just upon the Jews, but upon humanity&#x27;s original sin and the &quot;vices and crimes which people have committed from the beginning of the world to the present day and will go on committing until the end of time.&quot; Thus, Isaac, argued, even within the context of Catholic doctrine, it would be possible for the Holy See to make a statement distancing the Church from preaching the concept of Jewish deicide (to which Isaac attributed a significant bulk of what he called &quot;Christian anti-semitism&quot;). Roncalli, more so than his predecessors, was favourably disposed to such a suggestion; previously as the Archbishop Apostolic Delegate to Turkey, he had had a long relationship with Jewish communities and since being raised to the Papacy in 1958, had ushered in a period of &quot;openness to the world&quot; (what was called &quot;giovanissimo&quot;). Roncalli had already removed from the Good Friday prayer for the Jews the term &quot;perfidious&quot; (meaning faithless) in 1959.

Isaac, a French-born Jew, had a long history of activism in regards to Jewish ethno-religious concerns, tracing back to the Dreyfus affair when he was a teenager. Leading up to the Second World War, he had been part of the left-wing group &quot;CVIA&quot; and after the war he had founded, along with Jacob Kaplan, Edmond Fleg and other French-born Jews, the &quot;Amitié Judéo-chrétienne de France&quot; on 26 February 1948. This was following on from the Seelisberg Conference of the International Council of Christians and Jews (originally an American-British initiative) a year earlier at which Isaac had been a key speaker. Through several works, &quot;Jesus and Israel&quot; (1946), the &quot;Genesis of Anti-Semitism&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Teaching of Contempt&quot; (1962)—the latter published at the start of Vatican II—Isaac had laid out his central thesis that, the &quot;most dangerous form of anti-semitism is Christian anti-semitism&quot;, which he treats not as a peripheral anomaly, but inherent in its origins, from the Passion as described by the Four Evangelists in the Gospels, through the Church Fathers to the present day. Isaac&#x27;s solution to this was that Christianity must &quot;amend&quot; its beliefs, expunge from its doctrines any &quot;teachings of contempt&quot; which present Rabbinic Judaism as rejected or inferior and adopt a new relationship with Jews. The Vicomte Léon de Poncins, a French aristocrat and contemporary Catholic critic of Isaac, held the view that Issac&#x27;s presentation was bias, due to its absence of any recognition of anti-Christian teachings within Rabbinic Judaism and addressing historic controversies (i.e., Jesus in the Talmud, the Marranos and accusations of Jewish involvement in anti-Christian revolutionary movements) and that Isaac&#x27;s theories merely aimed to heap calumny upon the Catholic Church, accusing it of injustice.

John XXIII had created the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity (SECU), a few days before his meeting with Isaac on 5 June 1960. This organisation was to be headed up by Cardinal Augustin Bea, a veteran German Jesuit cleric, with Bishop Johannes Willebrands, a Dutch clergyman, appointed as his Secretary. The body was developed to address the relationship between the Catholic Church and other separate groups who identified as Christians. Many of the &quot;periti&quot; appointed to the Secretariat had been part of the ecumenical movement and thus tended to be supportive of a broad and liberal interpretation of its objectives. With the first plenary meeting of the SECU in November 1960, a second official mandate was put under their aegis: a view on Catholic–Jewish relations. Bea sought outside opinion from Jewish figureheads for &quot;Dei Judaeis&quot; and was advised to approach Nahum Goldmann, president of the World Jewish Congress. The two men met in Autumn 1960: Goldmann explained to Bea that while the WJC were open to the idea, many proponents of Orthodox Judaism would be resistant to any collaboration. Some of the Orthodox Rabbis, while opposed to Christianity for theological reasons anyway, also feared that they too may be pressured into changing exclusivistic doctrines essential to their own religion, such as their claim to being the &quot;chosen people&quot; and thus preferred not to get involved. Similarly, within the Catholic Church itself, conservative elements in the Curia and the Doctrinal Commission (with figures such as Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani and Fr. Sebastian Tromp) were opposed to the works of the SECU, due to what they viewed as the threat to Catholic doctrine by religious indifferentism.

If predominantly Latin Catholic conservatives within the Roman Curia were opposed to any document on the Jews for theological reasons, then the Arab world (whether Muslim or Christian) was concerned with it for immanently political reasons, relating to the Arab–Israeli conflict. Egypt, then under the leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser, particularly concerned itself with all Vatican documents on the Jews which were published since the time of Isaac&#x27;s visit to Roncalli back in 1960. The &quot;Voice of the Arabs&quot;, based in Cairo, ascribed this move to a &quot;Zionist plot to capitalize on the Vatican Council in order to further the oppression of the Palestinian refugees.&quot; The Lebanese Embassy and the Egyptian Embassy in Rome made their complaints known to the Vatican. In spite of this, Roncalli allowed the SECU under Bea to continue its work on a document on Jewish-Catholic relations. Bea openly met with Ralph Friedman and Zacariah Shuster of the American Jewish Committee at Rome in 1961, inviting them to submit a memorandum on anti-Jewish elements in Catholic textbooks and liturgy. The AJC responded to the SECU with two documents: &quot;The Image of the Jew in Catholic Teaching&quot; by Judith Banki and then &quot;Anti-Jewish Elements in Catholic Liturgy&quot;, outlining the changes to Church teachings and practices that they wanted the planned Council to implement. As part of this, Bea also agreed to meet with Abraham Joshua Heschel of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and Max Horkheimer of the Frankfurt School in November 1961 to discuss new Church approaches to the Jews.

With the Curial conservatives—largely from Italy and Spain—and the Arab Christians now on the backfoot, a different approach was presented; the security of Christians in the Middle East. It was put to Roncalli that nothing must be done that would compromise the position of the Catholic Church in the Middle East and that the Church has a pastoral responsibility to ensure above all that Christians in the Middle East could practice their faith unmolested (any kind of outreach to Jews likely being seen as a precursor to Holy See recognition of the State of Israel). Instead of a document just dealing with Judaism, a general statement on non-Christian religions should be prepared and in any case any Council should be delayed until at least 1965, they argued. Instead of agreeing to their demands, Roncalli doubled down on his project. He stated that a Council would be called in the following year and addressing Jewish-Catholic relations would be put to the Central Preparatory Commission. The &quot;Commentary Magazine&quot;, an American Jewish publication, also claimed in an article published in 1965, that Roncalli intended to set up a permanent Secretariat for Jewish Relations after the council, the SECU itself would be permanent and that non-Christian advisers would be permitted to attend the council and be able to submit documents to it, despite not being members of the Catholic Church.

Working underneath Bea were four clerics; John M. Oesterreicher, Gregory Baum, Leo Rudloff and Georges Tavard. The German, Karl Thieme, who was not involved in the drafting, was a major influence on the intellectual reorientation of Oesterreicher due to the debates the two had. After meeting several times at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, the group drafted for Bea a study document &quot;Questions Concerning the Jews&quot; (&quot;Questiones de Iudaeis&quot;), which was drafted properly as the &quot;Decree on the Jews&quot; (&quot;Decretum de Iudaeis&quot;), with Oesterreicher&#x27;s pen being most prominent. The document was completed in November 1961. External pressure on the Catholic Church to conform to the &quot;zeitgeist&quot; and make an explicit statement on Judaism was also heightened by a meeting in New Delhi in December 1961, where the World Council of Churches (a major ecumenical organisation controlled by Protestants) issued an explicit proclamation in which they stated &quot;the historic events which led to the Crucifixion should not be so presented as to fasten upon the Jewish people of today responsibilities which belong to our corporate humanity.&quot; The polemics intensified, as Egyptian media outlets such as &quot;Al Gomhuria&quot; claimed that Bea&#x27;s ancestral name was &quot;Behar&quot; and that he was of Jewish ancestry. The actually confirmed Jewish ancestry of converts who were involved in writing the document under Cardinal Bea; Oesterreicher and Baum; was also highlighted as proof of a supposed &quot;Zionist plot&quot;.

The initial drafting of &quot;Decretum de Iudaeis&quot; by the SECU was completed in November 1961. The actual text of the document was four paragraphs long. Much of the first paragraph was uncontroversial to all factions, as it highlighted the continuity of the Catholic Church with the Patriarchs and Prophets of Israel before the coming of Jesus Christ and the nature of the Church as the spiritual continuation of ancient Israel&#x27;s covenant with the god of Abraham (the only criticism conservative elements had of this was the relevance of Old Covenant Judaism to a document on relations with modern Talmud-centered Rabbinic Judaism). Much of the controversy over the actual text of &quot;Decretum de Iudaeis&quot;, was based on innovationary interpretations of &quot;Romans 11&quot;, which was used as justification for the line &quot;it would be an injustice to call this people accursed, since they are greatly beloved for the sake of the Fathers and the promises made to them.&quot; Contrary to &quot;Matthew 27&quot;, which mentioned a blood curse, traditionally highlighted by many Church Fathers and Doctors of the Church. The text, also referencing &quot;Romans 11&quot;, broached eschatological themes in regards to the eventual union of Jews with the Church. This new interpretation of &quot;Romans 11&quot; had been developed by Karl Thieme (a longtime correspondent of John M. Oesterreicher, one of the main SECU &quot;periti&quot; and drafters under Bea), a pioneer in Catholic-Jewish interfaith dialogue since the late 1930s and a contributor to Gertrud Luckner&#x27;s &quot;Freiburger Rundbrief&quot;. According to John Connelly, author of &quot;From Enemy to Brother&quot; (2012), for the draft Oesterreicher directly borrowed from Thieme&#x27;s vision for &quot;Romans 11&quot;, which he had formulated for an ecumenical congress in Evanston in 1954 (Thieme had in turn being influenced by Karl Barth and Barth had allegedly drawn it from Moses Maimonides). In addition to this, a final, uncited paragraph in this version of the draft claimed that &quot;Whoever despises or persecutes this people does injury to the Catholic Church.&quot;

In June 1962, the World Jewish Congress, acting on its own initiative, appointed Dr. Chaim Wardi, an Israeli counsellor in the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs, as an &quot;unofficial Jewish observer&quot; at the council. The Israeli Foreign Ministry under Golda Meir publicly endorsed this. The issue became known as the &quot;Wardi affair&quot; and caused a political crisis for the Vatican under Roncalli, who had maintained that the document had no political implications and was about encouraging amicable religious relations. Within five days of Wardi&#x27;s &quot;appointment&quot;, Cardinal Amleto Giovanni Cicognani as Secretary of the Central Preparatory Commission removed the &quot;Decretum de Iudaeis&quot; schema from the agenda (as Cardinal Secretary of State, he was particularly sensitive to diplomatic issues), never to be presented in this form to the council as a whole. While the Jewish schema was off the agenda for the First Session of Vatican II, the issue was not put to rest, as liberals, starting with the actions of Cardinal Achille Liénart made a strong early showing to direct the general course of the council. The possibility of a Jewish document still loomed large for its opponents. In October 1962, with the opening of the council, a document entitled &quot;Il Complotto contro la Chiesa&quot; (&quot;The Plot Against the Church&quot;) under the &quot;pseudonym&quot; of Maurice Pinay was anonymously distributed to all attending. Allegedly funded by Egypt and elements in northern Italy, the specific authorship of the document has remained a mystery. The document was originally authored in Spanish and is potentially a collaborative work of Mexican origin; some Italian sources have attributed the spread of the document at the Council in part to Fr. Joaquín Sáenz y Arriaga, a Mexican priest and former Jesuit. It warned vigilance to the Council members, with the 800-page polemic claiming that since the times of Christ, for 1900 years, Judaism had worked to overthrow Christianity and the Catholic Church, claiming involvement of the &quot;Synagogue of Satan&quot; in every major heresy, as well as encouraging &quot;enemies&quot; such as Freemasonry and Communism.

===Second Session of the Council, 1962–1963===
Since his initial meetings with Bea in 1962, with many other meetings following, including significantly a meeting at the AJC&#x27;s headquarters in New York on 31 March 1963; Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel became the primary figure articulating the religious Jewish viewpoint to the Vatican on behalf of the American Jewish Committee during the Second Vatican Council. He had been brought into contact with Bea, through his student, the AJC&#x27;s Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum. Associated with Conservative Judaism, Heschel also had a keen interest in Jewish mysticism. Unafraid to get involved in politics, Heschel had inserted himself into the American civil rights movement and protested against the Vietnam War. His memorandum on behalf of the American Jewish Committee, entitled &quot;On Improving Catholic–Jewish Relations&quot;, had a significant influence on proceedings of Bea&#x27;s Secretariat. The meeting in New York had also been attended by Bea&#x27;s Secretary Msgr. Johannes Willebrands and Fr. Felix Morlion, president of Rome&#x27;s Pro Deo University. The evening following the AJC meeting, a lavish dinner was put on in honour of Bea at New York&#x27;s Plaza Hotel. It included over 400 Jewish, Protestant and Catholic leaders. As well as Herschel and Bea, other major figures present included U Thant, the Secretary General of the United Nations and Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, President of the UN General Assembly, American Cardinals Richard Cushing and Francis Spellman and also Nelson Rockefeller as Governor of New York, amongst many others. According to Lazare Landau, writing in the &quot;Tribune Juive&quot;, similar, but more discreet meetings took place in France between Fr. Yves Congar and the Jewish community at the &quot;Centre communautaire de le Paix&quot; in Strasbourg.

The main aims of Heschel and the Jewish side had been to encourage the alteration of the Catholic presentation of Jewish responsibility in regards to the trial and crucifixion of Jesus Christ (what is sometimes known as Jewish deicide). And in addition to this, the Jewish side wanted a stop to any efforts; whether peaceful or not; at converting Jews to Christianity. While Cardinal Bea was highly sympathetic, attempting to present this within a framework of Catholic doctrinal orthodoxy, which it would require to pass through the council was proving difficult to achieve, for a number of reasons. Specifically, the Gospel of Matthew mentions the blood curse and the Gospel of John many similar themes. In addition to this, the Magisterium of the Catholic Church traditionally affirmed &quot;Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus&quot; and that the covenant with God, since Jesus Christ was exclusively with the Christians and that the Catholic Church is the New Israel (superseding any ancestry-based Old Covenant; rendering Jewish rites null and void). These teachings had passed down through the Gospels, many Church Fathers, Doctors of the Church and Ecumenical Councils over numerous centuries. Nevertheless, Cardinal Bea, with the blessing of Roncalli intended to press forward at the Second Session with these proposed changes. It had been decided that, after the setback of the Wardi affair, the schema, now entitled &quot;On the Attitude of Catholics Toward Non-Christians and Especially Toward Jews&quot; would be incorporated as a fourth chapter under a document &quot;On Ecumenism&quot;; this while a minor setback, was still satisfactory to its proposers because the drafting of that document also fell under the control of Bea&#x27;s Secretariat.

In 1963, a controversial play was released by the German writer Rolf Hochhuth called &quot;The Deputy&quot;, which popularised a theme of insinuating Pope Pius XII&#x27;s &quot;indifference&quot; to Nazi Germany&#x27;s mass killing of Jews during World War II. The play, offensive to the sensibilities of Catholics, led to a rebuff by Pius XII&#x27;s former advisor Giovanni Montini, Archbishop of Milan. In addition to this, Oesterreicher, writing in &quot;America&quot;, addressing the AJC and B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith directly, urged them to speak out against the play. Before the start of the Second Session, John XXIII died in June 1963, setting off the 1963 Papal conclave in the middle of the council. Several years after the death of John XXIII, a &quot;Prayer for the Jews&quot; was published in &quot;Commentary Magazine&quot; (associated with the AJC), attributed to Pope John XXIII, starting a rumor that Roncalli had intended it to be read out before his death but that it was stopped by the Church. The author, one &quot;F. E. Cartus&quot;, claimed that the prayer included the lines &quot;We realize that the mark of Cain stands upon our foreheads. Across the centuries our brother Abel has lain in the blood we drew, or shed tears we caused by forgetting Your love&quot; and &quot;Forgive us the curse we falsely attached to their name as Jews. Forgive us for crucifying You a second time in the flesh.&quot; Journalist Joseph Roddy alleged—in a 1966 &quot;Look Magazine&quot; article about the debate about Jews during the Second Vatican Council—that this prayer was a fabrication by Malachi Martin, one of the &quot;periti&quot; who worked under Cardinal Bea, a Jesuit priest who was known to be critical of Catholic hierarchy, and published his critiques under a wide number of pseudonyms. Roddy pointed to two timely and remunerated 1965 articles that were penned under the pseudonym &quot;F. E. Cartus&quot;, one for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and one for the American Jewish Committee&#x27;s magazine &quot;Commentary&quot;.

Roddy alleged that tidbits of information were leaked to the New York press that detailed Council failings vis a vis Jews under the pseudonym of &quot;Pushkin&quot;. Roddy claimed two unidentified persons were one and the same person—a &quot;young cleric-turned-journalist&quot; and a &quot;Jesuit of Irish descent working for Cardinal Bea ... who was active in the Biblical Institute&quot;—he figuratively named as &quot;Timothy O&#x27;Boyle-Fitzharris, S.J.&quot; so as not to reveal the true identity of his source. In his 2007 book &quot;Spiritual Radical: Abraham Joshua Heschel in America&quot;, Edward K. Kaplan confirmed that Martin cooperated with the American Jewish Committee during the Council &quot;for a mixture of motives, both lofty and ignoble. ... [He] primarily advised the committee on theological issues, but he also provided logistical intelligence and copies of restricted documents.&quot; It is confirmed in the book that Martin used the pseudonyms &quot;Forest&quot; and &quot;Pushkin&quot;. Kaplan acknowledges that &quot;The Pilgrim&quot; by Michael Serafian, was requested from Martin by Abraham J. Heschel, who arranged for the book to be published by Roger W. Straus, Jr.&#x27;s Farrar, Straus and Giroux printing company. It was published in the hope that it would influence the deliberations in the council. Once Martin&#x27;s identity as author was revealed, it led to protests &quot;and the book had to be removed from circulation at considerable financial loss to the publisher&quot;. Kaplan lastly states that Martin was the primary source of information for Joseph Roddy in writing his 1966 article for &quot;Look Magazine&quot;, and that &quot;O&#x27;Boyle-Fitzharris&quot; was, in fact, Martin. Kaplan judges the Roddy article as &quot;dangerously misleading [due] to the credence it gives to the claim that without organised Jewish pressure the council declaration on the Jews would not have been accepted.&quot;

Giovanni Montini (who took the Papal name Paul VI) emerged from the 1963 conclave as a continuity John XXIII candidate for the council; the conservative elements in the Curia had backed Cardinal Ildebrando Antoniutti and the more radical liberal elements had proposed Cardinal Giacomo Lercaro, but settled on Montini on the suggestion of Cardinals Frings and Liénart. Montini confirmed that Cardinal Bea&#x27;s mandate on addressing Judaism had been renewed.

The Second Session of the council began in the Autumn of 1963 and by 8 November 1963 when &quot;On Ecumenism&quot;, including its fourth chapter &quot;On the Attitude of Catholics Toward Non-Christians and Especially Toward Jews&quot; and fifth chapter &quot;On Religious Liberty&quot; was distributed to the Council Fathers, the liberals were confident, having gained in other areas of the Second Session. Elements in the Roman Curia, concerned that the chapters included heresy, approached Paul VI in private with severe concerns, accusing the Collegialists of setting up Bea as a de facto &quot;Second Pope&quot;. A document was also published, &quot;The Jews and the Council in the Light of Scripture and Tradition&quot;, arguing that the chapters were heretical. In addition to this, Paul VI was due to visit the Holy Places in East Jerusalem (then held by the Kingdom of Jordan) on 4 January 1964, whereby he would be meeting with Orthodox Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople, with the ecumenical goal of mending the schism between Catholicism and Orthodoxy. Members of the Curia thus argued that approving the controversial chapter on the Jews would jeopardize this effort and leave the 400,000 Orthodox Christians in the Arab world (including many Palestinian Christians) almost certain to oppose any sort of reunification with Rome. The first to third &quot;schemas&quot; should be put up to consideration and then at some later date (only two weeks of the Second Session remained) the fourth and fifth schemas should be looked at again. The stalling tactic worked and when the Second Session closed without the issue being voted on, Moderator, Cardinal Gregorio Pietro Agagianian was non-committal on a future review of the chapters.

===Third Session of the Council, 1963–1964===

====Cardinal Cicognani&#x27;s &quot;middle path&quot; revision====

In the United States, where Western political power was centralised in the 1960s and most of the American Bishops represented at the council were staunch supporters of a pro-Jewish statement and a declaration on religious liberty—with the notable exception of Cardinal James Francis McIntyre—there was anxiety about the way the Second Session had ended voiced at the National Catholic Welfare Council. During Paul VI&#x27;s visit to East Jerusalem, he travelled briefly through what was the State of Israel but was bogged down defending the record of Pius XII in light of &quot;The Deputy&quot; and made a speech hoping for Jews to convert to Christianity. While there, Maximos V Hakim, the Archbishop of Jerusalem from the Melkite Greek Catholic Church passed the Pope a document purporting to show &quot;a slow but deliberate process of de-Christianization&quot; initiated by the Israeli government. The concern of the American Bishops about the fate of the document was shared by the two secular Jewish points-of-contact for the American Bishops and thus the Vatican; Zacariah Shuster of the AJC and Joseph L. Lichten of the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith (Frith Becker of the World Jewish Congress also kept an eye on the proceedings, but took a more backseat role after the embarrassment caused by the Wardi affair). On the contested deicide issue, Cardinals Joseph Ritter, Albert Gregory Meyer, Richard Cushing and Francis Spellman were particularly insistent on supporting the Jewish position, as were Archbishop Patrick O&#x27;Boyle and Bishop Stephen Aloysius Leven; they also had the support of the Catholic Media Association. Some hope had been restored after six AJC members, headed up by Rose Sperry, had an audience with Paul VI in Rome and he personally agreed with the sentiment of Cardinal Spellman on the deicide issue.

A new draft document was prepared between January and September 1964. Paul VI had given the SECU orders to make mention of Islam and a general reference to non-Christian religions (in the hopes of alleviating the concerns of the Arab world; both the Eastern Catholics and the Arab governments). Also all reference to the much contested &quot;deicide&quot; issue would be removed due to the concerns the conservative faction had with it. This posed a problem for Cardinal Bea and his &quot;periti&quot;, as, if he agreed to making the document a general one about non-Christian religions, then it could be very easily argued that its drafting should fall under the newly created Secretariat for Non-Christians under Cardinal Paolo Marella, a conservative opponent of Bea. And if the SECU refused to make changes, it would naturally go back to Cardinal Cicognani&#x27;s Coordinating Committee (a Curialist, upholding the Pope&#x27;s agenda). Eventually, Bea agreed to remove the term &quot;deicide&quot;, but deferred to the Coordinating Committee on adding statements about other non-Christian religions. With the document now under the Coordinating Committee, some restructuring took place: discreetly avoiding letting the American Cardinals know the details, especially. The new version highlighted, like the very first draft, Christianity as heirs of the Prophets, Patriarchs and covenant of the Old Testament, it expressed hope that the Jews will eventually convert to the Catholic Church (and thus Catholic sermons and catechesis, should avoid denigrating Jews). It also stated that the Church, &quot;just as it severely disapproves of any wrong inflicted upon human beings everywhere, it also deplores and condemns hatred and maltreatment of Jews.&quot;

A report was “leaked” to &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 12 June 1964 reporting that the deicide issue had been cut out of the document. Whole sections of the confidential document turned up in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. According to Edward Kaplan, the author of &quot;Spiritual Radical: Abraham Joshua Heschel in America, 1940-1972&quot;, the AJC had secured a secret “mole” or &quot;double-agent&quot; within Bea&#x27;s Secretariat, an eccentric Jesuit priest, Malachi Martin. As part of his activities, Martin leaked pieces of confidential information about the progress of draft documents to the AJC and the New York media (in particular &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and &quot;Time Magazine&quot;) under the name “Pushkin”. Shuster referred to Martin in reports as &quot;Heschel&#x27;s young friend&quot;. In May 1964, an insider “tell-all account” about the council was published as &quot;The Pilgrim&quot;, under the pseudonym of &quot;Michael Serafian&quot;. This work was released by Malachi Martin, at the behest of Abraham Joshua Heschel, through Roger Straus’ Farrar, Straus and Giroux publishing company. Disparaging to Christianity, it claimed “no one conscious of what has made modern Europe can deny that the pyres and the crematoria, the mephitic smoke and stench of the extermination camps in Nazi Germany, were, if not the logical conclusion, at least one extremist consequence of the normal Christian attitude to the Jews.” Around this time, Msgr George G. Higgins arranged an audience with Paul VI for Arthur Goldberg, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. And then Cardinal Cushing arranged a meeting between Paul VI and Shuster, with Heschel also present. The Pope and Heschel clashed as the latter demanded the topics rejecting the deicide charge and blood guilt be reinserted and forbidding all Christian proselytising to Jews, to which Paul VI would not agree. Shuster somewhat embarrassed, spoke to Paul VI more diplomatically in French to cut Heschel out (as a secular man, Shuster was less concerned about the proselytising issue). Like Jules Isaac before him, Heschel invoked the Holocaust, in an article from September 1964 he wrote, &quot;I am ready to go to Auschwitz any time, if faced with the alternative of conversion or death.&quot;

Paul VI made his position known on the general direction of the council, with his August 1964 encyclical &quot;Ecclesiam suam&quot;, in which he tried to portray a cautious reformist position. He warned about relativism and even modernism, laying out a dialogue with the world which was still directed towards the ideal of conversion of non-Catholics, but on a practical level advocated cooperation for defending &quot;religious liberty, human brotherhood, good culture, social welfare, and civil order.&quot; For the first time, during the Third Session of the Second Vatican Council, the contents of the draft schema &quot;On the Jews and Non-Christians&quot;, was actually discussed on the floor by Council Fathers from 28 September 1964 and lasted two days. The &quot;middle-ground&quot; approach of the Paul VI-Cicognani revision (with the word deicide removed and mention of Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism included), while trying to please all factions managed to alienate all sides in the process. Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini, Archbishop of Palermo representing the conservative faction, concerned with Catholic doctrinal integrity in rejecting the document, warned against &quot;Talmudic teachings&quot; and stated at the podium; &quot;It is clear that Christians love Jews, for such is the law of Christians, but Jews should be exhorted to cease hating us and regarding us as contemptible animals.&quot; As ever, Catholic leaders from the Arab world also spoke out against any document on the Jews, including: Cardinal Patriarch Ignatius Gabriel I Tappouni of the Syriac Catholic Church, Patriarch Maximos IV Saigh and Bishop Joseph Tawil of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church and Archbishop Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir of the Maronite Church. Their view can be summed up by Archbishop Sfeir&#x27;s statement that &quot;We must not glorify Jews by such a declaration, we would only arouse Arab animosity and difficulties for bishops living in Arab lands.&quot;

The combined liberalising factions; headed up by the Rhineland Alliance and the American Cardinals; held different approaches, with ultimately the same goal in mind. One group, consisting of Cardinals Joseph Ritter of St. Louis, Albert Gregory Meyer of Chicago, Franz König of Vienna and Achille Liénart of Lille (supported by Bishops Elchinger and Méndez Arceo) took to the podium and spoke clearly against the &quot;watered down&quot; Paul VI-Cicognani revision and supported a full return to the previous draft authored by Cardinal Bea and the SECU, with the repudiation of the deicide theme against Jews of any generation clearly included. The other group, consisting of Cardinals Richard Cushing of Boston, Giacomo Lercaro of Bologna and Paul-Émile Léger of Montreal (supported by Bishops Nierman, Daem, Jaeger, Pocock and O&#x27;Boyle) proposed instead that the new draft should be accepted, to get its foot in the door, but amended to cover the deicide issue and an explicitly condemnation of what they called &quot;persecutions and injustices&quot; against Jews throughout the ages, to the present day. Two Americans, Bishop Leven and Archbishop O&#x27;Boyle, took the most radical position on the topic and proposed the document should repudiate any hope of Jewish conversion to Christianity, flirting with themes of universal salvation and dual-covenant theology respectively. Cardinal John Heenan, the English Archbishop of Westminster, also spoke in favour of the liberal faction on the issue at a press conference the following day. On the deicide question, he admitted that “Jesus Christ was condemned to death by the Sanhedrin,” but &quot;the Jewish people as such cannot be held guilty for the death of Christ.&quot; He affirmed to &quot;do all [he] could to satisfy the desires of [his] Jewish friends.&quot; The document was sent back to the SECU for amendments on 29 September 1964 with over 70 suggestions.

====Cardinal Felici&#x27;s letters, return to the SECU====

The political backlash was immediate: Salah al-Din al-Bitar, the Ba&#x27;athist Prime Minister of Syria announced &quot;world Zionism and Israel are trying to mobilize Catholics against the Arabs&quot; and that the declaration &quot;cannot be considered to be a purely religious matter.” Charles Helou, the President of Lebanon arranged for ten Bishops from the Levant and North Africa to telegram the Pope stating that the &quot;Gospels teach clearly the Jewish crime of deicide. In this matter of the Jewish declaration we see clearly the intrigues of Zionist politics.&quot; Similar statements were made by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, at the insistence of the Egyptian government. The political implications of the document was discussed privately at the Cairo Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in October 1964 between Syrian, Lebanese and Egyptian delegates. It was agreed that they would not make a public statement on the issue at the Conference but that Sukarno, President of Indonesia, would discuss it with Paul VI during his visit on 12 October 1964. At this meeting, Sukarno warned that all Vatican diplomatic missions in Arab countries might be closed if the document was adopted. At the same time that Sukarno was visiting Rome, a Palestinian delegation lodged a complaint with the Vatican about the document, seeing it as favouring Zionism by proxy, despite the assurances of the Vatican that it was not political in nature.
In the middle of this crisis, two letters had been received by Bea from Cardinal Pericle Felici, Secretary General of the council on 9 October 1964. It dealt with two key documents under the auspices of the SECU; &quot;On Religious Liberty&quot; and &quot;On the Jews and Non-Christians&quot;. The letter stated that Paul VI wanted a completely new text to be drafted on religious liberty, with a more mixed commission involved in creating the draft; including the addition of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre (Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers), Cardinal Michael Browne, Fr. Aniceto Fernández Alonso (Master of the Order of Preachers) and Cardinal Giovanni Colombo. Of these men, the first three were unambiguously hostile to the document and the latter was a personal favourite of Paul VI. Meanwhile, the Jewish issue would not be addressed in a stand-alone document, but would become part of &quot;Schema 13&quot;. This too would be rewritten by a more mixed commission including members drawn from Bea&#x27;s Secretariat and Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani&#x27;s Doctrinal Commission. Cardinal Felici&#x27;s two letters were &quot;leaked&quot; by Malachi Martin and became features in publications such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

The liberals, drawn from the Rhineland Alliance and the American Cardinals, arranged a memorandum to be issued to the Pope to protest this in the strongest terms. A gathering took place at the residence of Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne, where a number of other Cardinals added their voice to the petition. Supporters of the Frings motion explicitly named by the media included longtime interested parties Cardinals Ritter, Meyer, König, Liénart and Lercaro, along with Cardinals Raúl Silva Henríquez of Chile, Julius Döpfner of Munich, Joseph-Charles Lefèbvre of Bourges, Bernardus Johannes Alfrink of Utrecht and Leo Joseph Suenens of Brussels. This was highly significant as it included three out of four Moderators of the Second Vatical Council (only the Eastern Catholic Moderator, Cardinal Gregorio Pietro Agagianian, did not sign up to it). They wanted the return of the Jewish document and the document on religious liberty to the SECU, they wanted to complain that the conservative minority were already able to &quot;water down&quot; some of the more radical elements in documents that had already been voted on and they were opposed to delaying the Council any further (rumours had abounded that Paul VI wanted to delay the council as it stood for three years, so the subjects covered could mature for a Fourth Session). With this memorandum in hand, the leader of the faction, Cardinal Frings held a meeting with Paul VI on 13 November 1964 to express the concerns of the liberal Council fathers. Frings demanded that the Pope not intervene unilaterally (invoking the recent victories for Collegiality) and to follow the procedural rules established by the council. Paul VI intimated that he would take into consideration concerns, but also wanted to go more slowly, holding that radical steps would confuse and alienate the Catholic faithful in places like Italy, Spain and Latin America.

Not just on this question, but in general, the Third Session of the Second Vatican Council had been a disaster for the conservative faction in the lead up to the presentation of the Jewish document in September 1964. &quot;Lumen gentium&quot; had been voted in favour of which endorsed Collegiality and married lay deacons. &quot;Unitatis redintegratio&quot; allowed for closer ecumenical ties with non-Catholics and allowed for all who are baptised the &quot;right to be called Christian&quot;, endorsing in some cases for common worship. The proposed stand-alone document on Mariology, which was to declare the Blessed Virgin Mary the Mediatrix of All Graces (something Protestants would not accept), was thrown out and subsumed under &quot;Lumen gentium&quot;. As well as the document on the Jews, there was still outstanding a document proclaiming religious liberty and also &quot;Schema 13&quot; on the horizon, with debates on issues such as contraception, birth control, conscientious objection, disarmament, etc., no longer completely off the table. Thus, the conservative minority were fighting a rear-guard action on numerous fronts. At a meeting held on the same day as Frings’ audience with Paul VI, the conservative grouping the &quot;Coetus Internationalis Patrum&quot; under the Presidency of Archbishop Geraldo de Proença Sigaud met with Cardinal Ruffini in attendance to discuss what they should do next. They were confidence that Paul VI would never allow a stand-alone Jewish document due to the mounting Arab political pressure and decided, contrary to what Cardinal Felici had laid out, they would work against the Jewish issue being covered in &quot;Schema 13&quot; (this document, &quot;On the Church in the Modern World&quot;, was going to pass, just its final composition was still in play and if the Jewish issue was under it then it could slip through). This would prove to be a tactical blunder.

====Black Thursday, Council fathers vote====

Following these discussions, the SECU under Bea prepared a new draft very favourable to the position of the liberals. The document stripped out all mention of conversion of Jews and condemning accusations of &quot;deicide&quot; was back. This, despite carrying a more ambiguous title, with Jews no longer explicitly highlighted, with the &quot;Declaration on the Church&#x27;s Relationship to Non-Christian Religions&quot;. Bea hoped that Paul VI would be favourably disposed to this, with his upcoming visit to Bombay in the Republic of India, as a sympathetic comment on Hinduism was also included, alongside generic statements against &quot;discrimination.&quot; When the document came to Cardinal Ottaviani&#x27;s Theological Commission for examination, the Commission refused to incorporate it into &quot;Schema 13&quot; and without proposing alterations to the text, simply returned it to the SECU. Then it went back to Cardinal Cicognani&#x27;s Coordinating Committee (who, technically could not alter the text). The Egyptian Ministry of Guidance had got wind of the new draft through conservative allies in Rome and was preparing a memorandum from Christian leaders in the Arab world against it on 28 October 1964. Cicognani, who wanted to delay the document, wanted Egypt&#x27;s memorandum to be brought to Paul VI&#x27;s attention first. The memorandum asked why Rome would side with &quot;10 million Jews over 100 million Arabs&quot; and brought up the issue of Jewish deicide. On the other side, the American Cardinals (except McIntyre) and the Moderators of the council (from the Rhineland Alliance) were equally turning up the diplomatic pressure.

The pressure of the American Cardinals (including the on their side the American media) and support from most of the Council Fathers, as well as the increasingly blunt approach of the Egyptians had made it difficult for the Pope to do anything but order the printing of the new version of the document. Cicognani delayed for eight days as the end of the Third Session was approaching and proposed a maneuver, wherein the three &quot;natural&quot; parts of the document would be voted on individually; Hinduism and Buddhism as the first, Islam as the second and then the more controversial and keenly contested section on Judaism as third. It was decided that the showdown on two of the most fought over documents would take place successively; the document &quot;On Religious Liberty&quot; would be released on 17 November 1964 with a vote on 19 November, while &quot;Relations with Non-Christians&quot; would be released on 18 November 1964 with a vote promised for 20 November.
The main battle was seen as the document &quot;On Religious Liberty&quot; and &quot;Relations with Non-Christians&quot; was closely connected to it but flowed downstream from it. The liberal and conservative factions were much the same with both documents and indeed the American theologian John Courtney Murray, keenly supported by most of the American Cardinals, had provided the underpinning principles of the text &quot;On Religious Liberty&quot;. The fiercely contested nature of the documents came to a head in what is known as Black Thursday or the &quot;day of the bomb&quot; (&quot;la bomba oggi&quot;). On the Thursday, when Cardinal Eugène Tisserant arose to announce that no vote would be taking place on that document due to 250 to 300 wishing for it to be delayed, uproar broke out on the floor of the Third Session. Cardinals Meyer and Ritter argued openly with Cardinals Siri and Ruffini at the table of the Council Presidents and the American Bishop Francis Frederick Reh, Rector of the Pontifical North American College, took up a paper and began a petition among the angry Bishops, which garnered 1,500 supporters. The Americans—Cardinals Ritter, Meyer and Leger—stormed off to confront the Pope. Paul VI was watching the proceedings on close circuit television and had Cardinal Felici called to restore order to the proceedings. Bishop Émile-Joseph De Smedt, a prominent liberal clergymen and talented orator, took to the podium and explained in a matter of a fact manner how, why and who was responsible for delaying the vote on the document, to applause.

The Pope, having decided on a course of action that the vote on the document &quot;On Religious Liberty&quot; would be suspended until a Fourth Session, could not backdown lest he undermine his own authority. And so the Third Session entered its finally voting day deeply divided, with the liberal faction deeply frustrated and political, diplomatic and media hostility from states on both sides of the Cold War conflict; East and West; hostile to the idea of the confessional state, aimed at the Holy See. Attempts to introduce a relaxed atmosphere and mollify the Bishops with the announcement that those in attendance would be given a gold medal and that new powers would be conferred upon the General Superiors changed little. Even the most ardent member of the Roman Curia opposed to a document on Judaism, Cardinal Ruffini, at this point relented with international hostility aimed at the Holy See over the issue of religious liberty, admitting that a vote go ahead on Cardinal Bea&#x27;s &quot;Relations with Non-Christians&quot;, with the fight over the &quot;bigger fish&quot; &quot;On Religious Liberty&quot; successfully delayed for another day. There would be no split vote on different religions, all of the parts of the document would be voted on as a single entity. An overwhelming majority of the Council Fathers, 89%, voted in favour of the document, making &quot;Relations with Non-Christians&quot; an official document of the Second Vatican Council at the close of the Third Session. The document itself had not yet been promulgated by the Pope, so there was possibility for alteration to the text, but it could not now be removed from the council.

===Fourth Session of the Council, 1964–1965===
While leaders of the Jewish community in the United States had been elated by the ending of the Third Session, the exact nature of the text was not set in stone and there was still room to &quot;nuance&quot; or &quot;qualify&quot; the final text within Council rules. Between the closure of the Third Session on 21 November 1964 and the opening of the Fourth Session on 14 September 1965, a couple of controversies pertaining to the issue arose. Firstly, Luigi Maria Carli, the Bishop of Segni (a historically important diocese close to Rome) and member of the &quot;Coetus Internationalis Patrum&quot; wrote an article entitled, &quot;La questione giudaica davanti al Concilio Vaticano II&quot; in his diocesan magazine in February 1965 that affirmed the traditional teaching of the Catholic Church on the matter: namely, that adherents of Rabbinic Judaism at the time of Christ and to the present day, bore guilt for the trial and crucifixion of Christ and that &quot;judgment of condemnation by God&quot; hung over Judaism. The President of the American Jewish Committee bewailed the article as an &quot;anti-Semitic attack.&quot; A few weeks later on Passion Sunday, Paul VI himself, within the sermon during Mass in Rome, spoke of the role played by Jews of the time in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ (to the disappointment of Elio Toaff, the Chief Rabbi of Rome).
Most significant of all was the reporting in the &quot;New York Times&quot; by their Rome-correspondent Robert C. Dotty, that Paul VI had turned the document over to four doctrinal &quot;consultants&quot;, to make it not contradict Sacred Scripture and to mollify Arab opinion. Cardinal Bea was visiting New York that week and denied these claims, stating that it was still under the SECU and he sought to clear up any misunderstandings with Morris B. Abram of the American Jewish Committee about the Passion Sunday and Bishop Carli controversies. Nevertheless, in Rome, discussions were taking place about modifications to &quot;Chapter 4&quot; in May 1965: the word &quot;deicide&quot; was removed from the document forever, and additionally, Paul VI suggested adapting the phrase “deplores, indeed condemns, hatred and persecution of Jews” in order to exclude the words “indeed condemns”. These changes were voted on and accepted by elements of Bea&#x27;s Secretariat and the final form of the document had been reached. While this was taking place, the Maronite President of Lebanon, Charles Helou had an audience with the Pope and consequently, due to rumours which reached across the Atlantic, the Vatican Press Office made statements saying that the declaration remained unchanged. In the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Dotty was publishing articles with dubious claims that the document was &quot;under study&quot; (when it had already been completed) and that the document may be dropped completely. These and other similar articles led to criticisms of the Church from Willem Visser &#x27;t Hooft, the Protestant head of the World Council of Churches who warned that if the Jewish issue was removed there would be consequences for ecumenism. The AJC similarly, through the person of Rabbi Tanenbaum, confronted Msgr George G. Higgins, who passed on the concerns to Cardinal Cushing. The &quot;Deutscher Koordinierungsrat der Gesellschaften für Christlich-Jüdische Zusammenarbeit&quot; also sent a letter to Rome complaining that there was now a &quot;crisis of confidence &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; the Catholic Church.”

The earlier &quot;tactical leaks&quot; strategy involving Malachi Martin, the AJC&#x27;s mole who fed the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;TIME&quot;, to push the document in a direction desired by the American Jewish community was no longer effectual: Martin had been released from his priestly vows to the Jesuits in May–June 1965. The final form of the document had been released to the public, revealing that the Jewish elements had been watered down. A number of significant events took place that year, which garnered media attention: in October 1965, Paul VI became the first Pope to address the United Nations calling for “No more war, war never again.” While visiting the United States, at a Mass attended by 40,000 people at the Yankee Stadium in New York City (with millions more watching on television), Paul VI quoted &quot;John 20:19&quot; from the Gospel of John which states &quot;the disciples were bolted for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood before them and said &quot;Peace be to you!&quot;.&quot; While intended as a friendly message in &quot;the world&#x27;s most Jewish city&quot;, there were widespread misunderstandings and many Jews and liberal Catholics criticised the sermon as &quot;unthinking&quot; and linked this to the development of the document on the Jews. With the final vote approaching on 14 October 1965, both Jewish and Arab lobbies doubled-down and pushed for their agendas: Shuster of the AJC wanted the &quot;weakening&quot; of the document completely reversed, while a final 28-page Arab request was submitted, urging the Catholic Bishops to save the faith from “communism and atheism and the Jewish-Communist alliance.&quot;

While the form of the final document to be put to the floor at the Fourth Session of the Second Vatican Council had been disappointing to Shuster and Lichten of the AJC and B’nai B’rith respectively, Higgins convinced them that it was better to &quot;settle for what they could get.&quot; Bishop Stephen Aloysius Leven gave some false hope to his friends in the American Jewish community that the American bishops could still vote against the new version but upon realising that this would simply add votes to the Arab &amp; conservative side who wanted no document at all, the tactic was abandoned. By this point, even Cardinal Bea was content for the &quot;deicide&quot; issue to be dropped so long as the document was finally promulgated. Fr. René Laurentin, also wrote a late plea to strengthen the Jewish aspect of the document, but by now momentum was against further revisions. In its final form, 1,763 voted in favour of the document and 250 bishops opposed it. It was subsequently promulgated on 28 October 1965 by Pope Paul VI as &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; (&quot;In our time&quot;). The media in the United States and Europe subsequently ran with sensationalistic headlines such as &quot;Vatican Pardons Jews&quot; and &quot;Jews Exonerated in Rome&quot;, despite the fact that the deicide issue had now been removed from the document. Meanwhile, diplomatic statements were prepared by the AJC and B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, which tried to focus on what they saw as the positives while also airing their disappointment that some of the biggest issues had been dropped and the document much watered down from previous versions. The most vocal critic was Rabbi Heschel, who described avoiding dealing with the deicide issue as “an act of paying homage to Satan.”

==Summary==

The document begins by stating:

The key observation about other faiths reads: &quot;The Catholic Church rejects nothing that is true and holy in these religions. She regards with sincere reverence those ways of conduct and of life, those precepts and teachings, which though different in many aspects from the ones she holds and sets forth, nonetheless often reflect a ray of truth which enlightens all men.&quot;

&quot;Nostra aetate&quot; examined, among other belief systems, Hinduism and Buddhism, and stated that the Church &quot;rejects nothing that is true and holy&quot; in other religions.

Religious freedom became a new part of Catholic teaching with Vatican II and this declaration. &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; declared that there are positive elements in other religions and religious stereotypes and prejudices can be overcome through interreligious dialogue. Pope Francis said, &quot;From indifference and opposition, we&#x27;ve turned to cooperation and goodwill. From enemies and strangers, we&#x27;ve become friends and brothers.&quot;

The final paragraph calls on Catholics to enter into &quot;dialogue and collaboration&quot; with those of other faiths.

It describes the eternal questions which have dogged men since the beginning, and how the various religious traditions have tried to answer them.

It mentions some of the answers that some Hindus, Buddhists, and members of other faiths have suggested for such philosophical questions. It notes the willingness of the Catholic Church to accept some truths present in other religions in so much as they reflect Catholic teaching and may lead souls to Christ.

Part three goes on to say that the Catholic Church regards the Muslims with esteem, and then continues by describing some of the things Islam has in common with Christianity: worship of One God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, Merciful and Omnipotent, Who has spoken to men; the Muslims&#x27; respect for Abraham and Mary, and the great respect they have for Jesus, whom they consider to be a Prophet and not God. The synod urged all Catholics and Muslims to forget the hostilities and differences of the past and to work together for mutual understanding and benefit. Some of these themes are repeated in chapter two of &quot;Lumen gentium&quot;.

Part four of the text deals with Jews. Repeated in the text is the traditional teaching that the Catholic Church sees the beginnings of its Faith in the Patriarchs and Prophets of ancient Israel. It also notes that the Apostles and many of the early Disciples of Jesus Christ at the founding of the Catholic Church had their roots in the Jews of that time, despite the fact that &quot;Jerusalem did not recognize the time of her visitation, nor did the Jews in large number, accept the Gospel; indeed not a few opposed its spreading.&quot; The most significant departure in the document from previous approaches was that &quot;this sacred synod wants to foster and recommend that mutual understanding and respect which is the fruit, above all, of biblical and theological studies as well as of fraternal dialogues.&quot; This paved the way for Catholic–Jewish interfaith dialogue in the decades following on from the Second Vatican Council in a manner which was not commonplace before.

The final text of &quot;Nostra aetate&quot;, as promulgated in 1965, in regards to the question of Jewish deicide (that is to say Jewish culpability for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus Christ) did not include the word &quot;deicide&quot; specifically, as it had in some previously proposed versions. On this issue, the document says &quot;what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today.&quot; The exclusion of the specific term &quot;deicide&quot; and the textual ambiguity resulting from the fierce debates at the council is such that the text has been interpreted in different ways, the &quot;cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction&quot; allows conservatives to present that the Jews who had become Christians, then and since, were not culpable, while others present it as exonerating the Jews of deicide as a whole. At the time of its promulgation, liberal elements within the SECU and American Jewish organisations saw the final version of the text as a defeat for their position on this issue.

On the question of antisemitism, the document says that the Church &quot;decries hatred, persecutions, displays of anti-Semitism, directed against Jews at any time and by anyone.&quot; Earlier versions of the text said that it &quot;condemns&quot; it, but this was removed from the final version.

The fifth part states that all men are created in God&#x27;s image, and that the &quot;Church reproves, as foreign to the mind of Christ, any discrimination against men or harassment of them because of their race, color, condition of life, or religion.&quot;

==Opposition==
&quot;Nostra aetate&quot;, along with the adjacent documents, &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot; (On Religious Liberty), &quot;Unitatis redintegratio&quot; (On Ecumenism), and &quot;Lumen gentium&quot; (The Church) are among the documents from the Second Vatican Council that are frequently highlighted for the most scathing criticism by traditional Catholics. The central accusation, from traditionalist Catholics, is that these documents express and encourage a spirit of religious indifferentism, that is to say that they dissuade the conversion of non-Catholics (contrary to the Catholic doctrine of &quot;Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus&quot; and thus, within this context, exclude them from the possibility of attaining eternal salvation), that they also discourage or confuse those who are already Catholic by suggesting that other religions may have validity and that there is a radical discontinuity with what the Catholic Church has already proclaimed Magisterially about non-Christian religions.

The statement &quot;They adore the one God, living and subsisting in Himself; merciful and all-powerful, the Creator of heaven and earth&quot;, has been accused by the SSPX of being an explicit error within the context of Catholic teaching, due to the fact that the Catholic Church defines the one God in the &quot;Apostles&#x27; Creed&quot; and the &quot;Nicene Creed&quot; as the Holy Trinity (Islamic doctrine explicitly rejects the Divinity of Jesus Christ and does not acknowledge the Holy Ghost as God) and sacred scripture, in John 14:6 has Jesus Christ stating &quot;No one comes to the Father except through Me&quot;. However, this accusation has been answered by pointing out that, if Muslims do not worship the true God, then neither did the ancient patriarchs such as Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Moses, since they had no knowledge of the Holy Trinity. Fr. Brian Harrison O.S. mentions: &quot;In short, although Muslim worship, which includes a flat denial of Christ’s divinity, is not in itself fitting, God-pleasing, or salvific in character, the object of that defective worship—that is, the Being toward whom it is directed—is nevertheless the true God, imperfectly understood, as distinct from a disguised demon or a nonexistent figure of myth or legend.&quot; The document also states &quot;The Church regards with esteem also the Moslems&quot;, which traditionalists have argued is inappropriate to say in a Church document, claiming that within all major Islamic schools of &quot;fiqh&quot;, the punishment for a Muslim male to convert to the Catholic Church is the death penalty and that Islamic law places Christian non-Muslim nations into the category of &quot;dar al-harb&quot; (&quot;house of war&quot;).

== Post-Conciliar developments ==

To flesh out these implications and ramifications, the Vatican&#x27;s Commission for Interreligious Relations with the Jews issued its &quot;Guidelines and Suggestions for Implementing the Conciliar Declaration Nostra Aetate&quot; in late 1974. The Commission later released &quot;Notes on the Correct Way to Present Jews and Judaism in the Teaching and Catechesis of the Roman Catholic Church&quot; in 1985.

The U.S. Congress passed a resolution acknowledging &quot;Nostra aetate&quot;&#x27; fortieth anniversary.

The Vatican&#x27;s Commission for Religious Relations with Jews released a new document exploring the unresolved theological questions at the heart of Christian–Jewish dialogue. Entitled &quot;The Gifts and Calling of God are Irrevocable&quot;, it marked the 50th anniversary of the ground-breaking declaration &quot;Nostra Aetate&quot;.

On the fiftieth anniversary of the document&#x27;s release, Sayyid Syeed, the national director of the Islamic Society of North America&#x27;s Office for Interfaith and Community Alliances, pointed out that &quot;Nostra Aetate&quot; was released during the 1960s civil rights movement in the United States, at a time when Islamic centers and student groups were being founded on university campuses, and from these humble beginnings the &quot;Catholic church acted as a big brother&quot; in its understanding of a religious minority, a sentiment that has continued since the terrorist attacks of 9/11 when the Church opened its doors to them amidst growing Islamophobia.

<text>Gravissimum educationis is the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s Declaration on Christian Education. It was promulgated on 28 October 1965 by Pope Paul VI, following approval by the assembled bishops by a vote of 2,290 to 35.

To revitalize this teaching, updating it to today’s challenges, the Holy Father Francis created the Gravissimum Educationis Foundation – Culture for Education.

==Description==
The document is generally referred to, not by its English-language title, &quot;Declaration on Christian Education&quot;, but by the opening words of its original Latin text, which mean &quot;extremely important education&quot;.

The document quotes at length from &quot;Divini illius Magistri&quot; (&quot;That divine teacher&quot;, 1929) by Pope Pius XI.

==Parents as primary educators==
&quot;Since parents have given children their life, they are bound by the most serious obligation to educate their offspring and therefore must be recognized as the primary and principal educators. This role in education is so important that only with difficulty can it be supplied where it is lacking. Parents are the ones who must create a family atmosphere animated by love and respect for God and man, in which the well-rounded personal and social education of children is fostered. Hence the family is the first school of the social virtues that every society needs.&quot;

== &quot;Gravissimum Educationis - Culture for Education&quot; Foundation ==
On October 28, 2015, Pope Francis founded the &quot;Gravissimum Educationis&quot; Foundation.

The Foundation is a not-for-profit, and pursues scientific and cultural aims to promote education and culture in the world. In particular, the Foundation aims to promote projects aimed at establishing and consolidating collaborative relationships between entities and institutions active in the educational sector; promote cultural projects and events aimed at fostering, also in the educational sphere, reflection on key topics of contemporary debate and dialogue between arts, cultures and faith; implement projects and initiatives related to the Global Compact on Education. 

The Foundation is an instrumental entity and participates in the mission of the Dicastery for Culture and Education of the Holy See, that preserves and promotes the cultural and educational heritage of the Catholic Church.

The Foundation is governed by a Board of Directors chaired by Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça. The Secretary General is Monsignor Davide Milani, and the Treasurer is Dr. Paolo Buzzonetti.

<text>From Here to Eternity is a 1953 American romantic war drama film directed by Fred Zinnemann and written by Daniel Taradash, based on the 1951 novel of the same name by James Jones. It deals with the tribulations of three United States Army soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Frank Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed portray the women in their lives. The supporting cast includes Ernest Borgnine, Philip Ober, Jack Warden, Mickey Shaughnessy, Claude Akins, and George Reeves.

It won 8 Academy Awards out of 13 nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director (Fred Zinnemann), Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor (Frank Sinatra), and Supporting Actress (Donna Reed). The film&#x27;s title originates from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1892 poem &quot;Gentlemen-Rankers&quot;, about soldiers of the British Empire who had &quot;lost [their] way&quot; and were &quot;damned from here to eternity&quot;.

In 2002, &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1941, bugler and career soldier Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, who was once a professional boxer, transfers from Fort Shafter to a rifle company at Schofield Barracks on the island of Oahu. Captain Dana &quot;Dynamite&quot; Holmes wants him on his regimental boxing team, but Prewitt refuses absolutely, with no further explanation. Consequently, Holmes makes Prewitt&#x27;s life miserable and ultimately orders First Sergeant Milton Warden to prepare a court-martial. Warden suggests doubling Prewitt&#x27;s company punishment as an alternative. Prewitt is hazed by the other NCOs and is supported only by his close friend, Private Angelo Maggio.

Prewitt and Maggio join a social club where Prewitt becomes attracted to Lorene. Prewitt confides to her he quit boxing after blinding his sparring partner. At the club, Maggio argues with stockade Sergeant &quot;Fatso&quot; Judson. Later, at a local bar, Judson provokes Maggio and the two nearly come to blows before Warden intervenes.

Despite being warned, Warden risks prison when he starts fraternizing with Holmes&#x27; wife, Karen. Her marriage to Holmes is unhappy and distant, made worse after Holmes&#x27; drinking and infidelity resulted in the stillbirth of her only child and consequent infertility. Karen encourages Warden to become an officer, which would enable her to divorce Holmes and marry him.

Maggio is sentenced to the stockade after walking off guard duty and getting drunk, subjecting him to Judson&#x27;s unqualified (and unauthorized) wrath. Prewitt discovers Lorene&#x27;s name is really Alma, and her goal is to make enough money at the club to go back to the mainland and marry. Prewitt tells her his career is in the military, and the two wonder whether they have a future together.

A member of Holmes&#x27; boxing team, Sergeant Galovitch, picks a fight with Prewitt. Holmes observes without intervening, as does the regimental commander. Holmes is about to punish Prewitt again but does nothing after learning Galovitch started the fight.

Maggio escapes from the stockade after a brutal beating from Judson and dies in Prewitt&#x27;s arms. Seeking revenge, Prewitt engages Judson in a back alley knife fight. Prewitt kills Judson but is badly wounded and stays with Lorene. Warden covers for Prewitt&#x27;s absence.

After initiating a review into Holmes&#x27; conduct, the regimental commander orders his resignation in lieu of a court martial. Holmes&#x27; replacement, Captain Ross, reprimands the other NCOs, demotes Galovitch to private, and affirms there will be no more promotions through boxing. Karen tells Warden that Holmes&#x27; resignation is forcing them back to the mainland, but Warden reveals he has no interest in becoming an officer, effectively ending their relationship. Warden promises her that they will meet somewhere someday.

On December 7, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor. Despite Lorene&#x27;s pleas to stay with her, Prewitt attempts to rejoin his company but is shot dead by military police when he refuses to halt. Warden identifies him as a hardhead but a good soldier.

Days later, Karen and Lorene coincidentally stand next to each other on a ship going to the mainland. Karen tosses her leis into the sea, wondering if she will ever return to Hawaii. Lorene tells Karen she is not returning as her &quot;fiancé&quot;, whom she identifies as Prewitt, was a bomber pilot who died during the attack and was awarded a Silver Star. Karen recognizes the name but says nothing.

==Cast==
==Production==

S. Sylvan Simon suggested to Harry Cohn that Columbia buy the rights to the novel and Simon was assigned to make the film but died from a heart attack in May 1951 before he could make preparations for the film.

Hollywood legend has it that Frank Sinatra got the role in the film by means of his alleged Mafia connections, and it was the basis for a similar subplot in &quot;The Godfather&quot;. However, that has been dismissed on several occasions by the cast and crew of the film. Director Fred Zinnemann commented that &quot;the legend about a horse&#x27;s head having been cut off is pure invention, a poetic license on the part of Mario Puzo, who wrote &quot;The Godfather&quot;&quot;. One explanation of Sinatra&#x27;s casting is that his then-wife Ava Gardner persuaded studio head Harry Cohn&#x27;s wife to use her influence with him; this version is related by Kitty Kelley in her Sinatra biography.

Joan Crawford and Gladys George were offered roles, but George lost her role when the director decided he wanted to cast the female roles against type, and Crawford&#x27;s demands to be filmed by her own cameraman led the studio to take a chance on Deborah Kerr, also playing against type.

Kim Stanley heavily campaigned for the role of Lorene, which later garnered an Academy Award for Donna Reed.

The on-screen chemistry between Lancaster and Kerr may have spilled off-screen; it was alleged that the stars became involved romantically during filming.

The songs &quot;Re-Enlistment Blues&quot; and &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; were written by Robert Wells and Fred Karger.

In 1951, LIFE magazine reported the novel&#x27;s sale price to Hollywood as $82,500.

==Differences from the novel==

Several of the novel&#x27;s controversial plot points were changed or eliminated for the film to satisfy the Production Code Office and the U.S. Army. Army cooperation was necessary in order to shoot on location at Schofield Barracks, use training aircraft, and obtain military footage of Pearl Harbor for use in the film, as well as for cost reasons. According to screenwriter Daniel Taradash, both the Code Office and the Army were impressed by his script, which reduced the number of censorship problems.
In the novel, Lorene was a prostitute at a brothel, but in the film, she is a hostess at a private social club. Karen&#x27;s hysterectomy in the novel was caused by the unfaithful Holmes transmitting gonorrhea to her, but in the film, her hysterectomy resulted from a miscarriage, thus avoiding the topic of venereal disease. The changes were made to meet Code Office standards.
In the novel, several of the enlisted men fraternize with homosexuals, and one soldier commits suicide as a result, but homosexuality is not mentioned or directly explored in the film. Again, the change was made to satisfy the Code Office. However, J. E. Smyth has written that the film&#x27;s treatment of Judson&#x27;s behavior towards Maggio &quot;has all the indications of sexual abuse, and therefore reintroduces the fear of homosexuality in the 1930s military that the rest of the script had to repress for obvious reasons of censorship&quot;. 
In the novel, Captain Holmes ironically receives his desired promotion, and is transferred out of the company. In the film, Holmes is forced to resign from the Army under threat of court-martial for his ill-treatment of Prewitt. The Army insisted on this change, which the filmmakers reluctantly made. Director Zinnemann later complained that the scene where Holmes is reprimanded was &quot;the worst moment in the film, resembling a recruiting short&quot;, and wrote, &quot;It makes me sick every time I see it.&quot;
In the novel, Judson&#x27;s systematic abuse of Maggio and other prisoners, including Prewitt at one point, is portrayed in detail. However, in the film, Maggio&#x27;s abuse happens offscreen, and it is told only verbally to Prewitt, who remains free. The Army required that the abuse of Maggio not be shown and that Judson&#x27;s behavior toward Maggio be portrayed as &quot;a sadistic anomaly, and not as the result of Army policy, as depicted in Jones&#x27; book&quot;. The filmmakers agreed, seeing these changes as improvements. Maggio, who survives and is discharged in the novel, dies in the film, having been combined with two other prisoner characters from the novel (one of whom is killed by Judson in the novel) to add drama and make Maggio a stronger, more tragic figure. The Army was further appeased by the filmmakers&#x27; inclusion of a line suggesting that Maggio&#x27;s death was partially caused by his falling off a truck during a prison break, rather than solely by Judson&#x27;s beatings.

==Reception==
Opening to rave reviews, &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; proved to be an instant hit with critics and public alike, the Southern California Motion Picture Council extolling: &quot;A motion picture so great in its starkly realistic and appealing drama that mere words cannot justly describe it.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; agreed:

The James Jones bestseller, &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, has become an outstanding motion picture in this smash screen adaptation. It is an important film from any angle, presenting socko entertainment for big business. The cast names are exceptionally good, the exploitation and word-of-mouth values are topnotch, and the prospects in all playdates are very bright, whether special key bookings or general run.

Of the actors, &quot;Variety&quot; went on to say,

Burt Lancaster, whose presence adds measurably to the marquee weight of the strong cast names, wallops the character of First Sergeant Milton Warden, the professional soldier who wet-nurses a weak, pompous commanding officer and the GIs under him. It is a performance to which he gives depth of character as well as the muscles which had gained marquee importance for his name. Montgomery Clift, with a reputation for sensitive, three-dimensional performances, adds another to his growing list as the independent GI who refuses to join the company boxing team, taking instead the &#x27;treatment&#x27; dished out at the C.O.&#x27;s instructions. Frank Sinatra scores a decided hit as Angelo Maggio, a violent, likeable Italo-American GI. While some may be amazed at this expression of the Sinatra talent versatility, it will come as no surprise to those who remember the few times he has had a chance to be something other than a crooner in films.

The &quot;New York Post&quot; applauded Frank Sinatra, remarking, &quot;He proves he is an actor by playing the luckless Maggio with a kind of doomed gaiety that is both real and immensely touching.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; also stated that, &quot;Frank Sinatra, a crooner long since turned actor, knew what he was doing when he plugged for the role of Maggio.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; concurred, writing that the film &quot;reveals that Frank Sinatra, in the part of Mr. Clift&#x27;s best friend who winds up in the stockade, is a first-rate actor.&quot;

The cast agreed; Burt Lancaster commented in the book &quot;Sinatra: An American Legend&quot; that, &quot;[Sinatra&#x27;s] fervour, his bitterness had something to do with the character of Maggio, but also with what he had gone through the last number of years. A sense of defeat and the whole world crashing in on him... They all came out in that performance.&quot;

Despite the rivalry between their respective characters, Sinatra and Borgnine, both from Italian roots, became lifelong friends. They corresponded with each other at Christmas season by exchanging cards signed using their film characters&#x27; names, &quot;Maggio&quot; and &quot;Fatso&quot;. At a Dean Martin Celebrity Roast honoring Sinatra, Borgnine mockingly reprised his Fatso Judson character.

The film was number one in the United States for four weeks during September 1953, with a gross of $2,087,000. With a final gross of $30.5 million equating to earnings of $12.2 million, &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; not only became one of the highest-grossing films of 1953, but also one of the ten highest-grossing films of the decade. Adjusted for inflation, its box office gross would exceed US$277 million in 2017 dollars.

Despite the positive response of the critics and public, the Army was reportedly not pleased with its depiction in the finished film, and refused to let its name be used in the opening credits. The Navy banned the film from being shown to its servicemen on its ships or Naval shore installations, calling it &quot;derogatory of a sister service&quot; and a &quot;discredit to the armed services&quot;, although the Army and Air Force Motion Picture services purchased the film for screenings.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 88% from 100 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;It has perhaps aged poorly, but this languidly paced WWII romance remains an iconic, well-acted film, featuring particularly strong performances from Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 85 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
William Holden, who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, felt that Lancaster or Clift should have won. Sinatra later said that he thought his performance of heroin addict Frankie Machine in &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; was more deserving of an Oscar than his role as Maggio.

<text>The Lost Weekend is a 1945 American drama film noir directed by Billy Wilder, and starring Ray Milland and Jane Wyman. It was based on Charles R. Jackson&#x27;s 1944 novel about an alcoholic writer. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It also shared the Grand Prix at the first Cannes Film Festival, making it one of only three films—the other two being &quot;Marty&quot; (1955) and &quot;Parasite&quot; (2019)—to win both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the highest award at Cannes.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 70 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Director Billy Wilder&#x27;s unflinchingly honest look at the effects of alcoholism may have had some of its impact blunted by time, but it remains a powerful and remarkably prescient film.&quot; In 2011, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
On Thursday, alcoholic New York writer Don Birnam is packing for a weekend vacation with his brother Wick. Although they are leaving mid-afternoon, when Don&#x27;s girlfriend Helen drops by with gifts for him to enjoy over the weekend and reveals she has two tickets for a concert that afternoon, Don suggests that Wick attend with her; the brothers can then catch a later train. His motive is self-serving: he has a bottle hanging by a rope outside the window and wants to retrieve it and secure it in his suitcase. Wick eventually discovers the bottle. Don claims to have forgotten it was there; Wick pours it down the drain. Now, knowing that all the liquor Don had hidden in the apartment has been disposed of, and believing he has no money for more, Helen and Wick go to the concert.

After finding ten dollars Wick left for the cleaning lady, Don heads for Nat&#x27;s Bar, calling in at a liquor store on the way to purchase two bottles of rye. He intends to be back home in time to meet Wick and catch their train but his drinking makes him lose track of time. Arriving home, he sees Wick and Helen on the street and, concealing himself, overhears Wick tell Helen he has given up on helping his brother and is leaving, scolding her for deciding to stay and wait for Don. In due course, Don manages to sneak back into the apartment and hide a bottle while drinking the other one.

On Friday, back at Nat&#x27;s Bar, Don learns from Nat that Helen came in looking for him the previous night and criticizes Don for treating her so badly. Don says he intends to write a novel about his battle with alcoholism, called &quot;The Bottle&quot;. In a flashback, he recalls how he first met Helen at the opera house. The cloakroom has mixed up their coats. Subsequently, the two strike up a romance, and he remains sober during this time. While going to meet her parents, he overhears them talking about his unemployment and how they are not certain if he is good enough for their daughter. He loses his nerve and sneaks off, after phoning Helen from a booth and making a phony excuse, ostensibly intending to actually meet her parents later. However, he returns home and gets drunk. She goes to his apartment, where Wick tries to cover for him, but Don confesses that he is two people: &quot;Don the writer&quot;, whose fear of failure causes him to drink, and &quot;Don the drunk&quot;, who always has to be bailed out by Wick. Helen devotes herself to helping him.

After telling Nat the story behind his proposed novel, Don heads back home to begin writing it. However, his alcohol cravings get the better of him and he begins a desperate search for that second bottle from the previous night. He cannot remember where he hid it. He goes to a nightclub and, when he realizes he cannot pay the bill, he steals money from a woman&#x27;s purse. He is caught, thrown out, and told never to return. Once home, he finds the hidden bottle and drinks himself into a stupor.

On Saturday, Don is broke and feeling sick. He decides to pawn his typewriter so he can buy more alcohol, although he dreads the walk to the shop because he feels so ill. He discovers the pawnshops are closed for Yom Kippur. Desperate for money, he visits Gloria, a prostitute who has a crush on him. She gives him some money, but he falls down her stairs and is knocked unconscious.

On Sunday, Don wakes up in an alcoholics&#x27; ward, where a nurse, Bim Nolan, mocks him and other guests at &quot;Hangover Plaza&quot;. Bim offers to help offset his sure-to-come delirium tremens, but Don rejects the assistance and escapes while the staff are occupied with a raving, violent patient.

On Monday, Don steals a bottle of whiskey from a store after threatening the owner and spends the day drinking. Suffering from delirium tremens, he hallucinates a nightmarish scene in which a bat flies in through his window and kills a mouse, spilling its blood. His screams alert a neighbour, who contacts Helen, who immediately goes over. Finding Don collapsed and in a delirious state, she assists him to clean up and get to bed; she stays overnight on his couch.

On Tuesday morning, Don slips out and pawns Helen&#x27;s coat, the one that had brought them together. She trails him to the pawn shop and learns from the pawnbroker that Don traded the coat for his gun, for which he has bullets at home. She races back to Don&#x27;s apartment and interrupts him just as he is about to shoot himself. She pleads with him, even going so far as to beg him to drink the last portion of whisky left in the bottle he had stolen and which she had concealed. She declares she would rather he be alive as an alcoholic. He refuses and, while they are arguing, Nat arrives to return Don&#x27;s typewriter. After Nat leaves, Helen finally convinces him that &quot;Don the writer&quot; and &quot;Don the drunk&quot; are the same person. He commits to writing his novel &quot;The Bottle&quot;, dedicated to her, which will recount the events of the weekend. As evidence of his resolve, he drops a cigarette into the glass of whisky to make it undrinkable.

==Cast==
==Production and notable features==
Wilder was originally drawn to this material after having worked with Raymond Chandler on the screenplay for &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;. Chandler was a recovering alcoholic at the time, and the stress and tumultuous relationship with Wilder during the collaboration caused him to start drinking again. Wilder made the film, in part, to try to explain Chandler to himself.

Wilder originally wanted Jose Ferrer for the role of Don, but he turned it down. Charles Brackett&#x27;s first choice for playing Helen was Olivia de Havilland, but she was involved with a lawsuit that prevented her from being in any film at that time. It has been said that Katharine Hepburn and Jean Arthur were also considered for the role.

The majority of the film was shot at Paramount studios in Hollywood. Wilder, however, insisted they shoot part of the film on location in New York City to create a distinct sense of realism. On October 1, 1944, Wilder and his small crew began filming in New York, mostly along Third Avenue in Midtown East Manhattan. To further create a realistic atmosphere, Wilder and his crew used hidden cameras, placing them behind boxes or in the back of trucks, and capturing Milland as he walked up 3rd Avenue among actual pedestrians who were unaware a film was being made. The production also had the unprecedented permission to film inside Bellevue Hospital in the alcoholic ward, a request that would be denied to future films. After completing filming in New York, the cast and crew returned to California to resume principal photography, where they recreated several New York locations, including a replica of P. J. Clarke&#x27;s, a tavern often frequented by author Charles Jackson.

The film also made famous the &quot;character walking toward the camera in a daze as time passes&quot; camera effect.

Once &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; was completed, it was shown to a preview audience, who laughed at what they considered Milland&#x27;s overwrought performance, and the studio actually considered shelving the film. Part of the problem was that the print shown at the preview did not have Miklós Rózsa&#x27;s original musical soundtrack, but instead had a temporary track containing upbeat jazz music. However, once the Rózsa score was in place, along with a re-shoot of the last scene, audiences and critics reacted favorably. The film&#x27;s musical score was among the first to feature the theremin, which was used to create the pathos of alcoholism.

Rights to the film are currently held by Universal Studios, which owns the pre-1950 Paramount sound feature film library via EMKA, Ltd.

The film differs significantly from the book by leaving out the novel&#x27;s noted homosexual overtones, namely the strong implication that Don Birnam is (as was the book&#x27;s author, Charles Jackson) a closeted homosexual.

The liquor industry launched a campaign to undermine the film even before its release. Allied Liquor Industries, a national trade organization, wrote an open letter to Paramount warning that anti-drinking groups would use the film to reinstate prohibition. Liquor interests allegedly enlisted gangster Frank Costello to offer Paramount $5 million to buy the film&#x27;s negative in order to burn it. Wilder quipped that if they’d offered him $5 million, &quot;I would have [burned the negative].&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office performance===
The film was a commercial success. Produced on a budget of $1.25 million, it grossed $11 million at the box office, earning $4.3 million in US theatrical rentals.

===Academy Awards===
At the 18th Academy Awards in March 1946, &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; received seven nominations and won in four categories.

===Cannes Film Festival===
This film also shared the 1946 &quot;Grand Prix du Festival International du Film&quot; at the first Cannes Film Festival and Milland was awarded Best Actor. To date, &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;, &quot;Marty&quot; (1955), and &quot;Parasite&quot; (2019) are the only films ever to win both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the highest award at the Cannes Film Festival. (&quot;Marty&quot; received the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; (Golden Palm), which, beginning at the 1955 festival, replaced the &quot;Grand Prix du Festival International du Film&quot; as the highest award.)

===National Film Registry===
In 2011, &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. The Registry said the film was &quot;an uncompromising look at the devastating effects of alcoholism&quot; and that it &quot;melded an expressionistic film-noir style with documentary realism to immerse viewers in the harrowing experiences of an aspiring New York writer willing to do almost anything for a drink.&quot;

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; was adapted as a radio play on the January 7, 1946, broadcast of The Screen Guild Theater, starring Milland, Wyman, and Faylen in their original film roles.

On March 10, 1946, three days after winning the Academy Award, Milland appeared as a guest on a radio broadcast of &quot;The Jack Benny Show&quot;. In a spoof of &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;, Milland and Jack Benny played alcoholic twin brothers. Phil Harris, who normally played Jack Benny&#x27;s hard-drinking bandleader on the show, played the brother who tried to convince Ray and Jack to give up liquor. (&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; said an announcer, &quot;the opinions expressed by Mr. Harris are written in the script and are not necessarily his own.&quot;) In the alcoholic ward scene, smart-aleck Frank Nelson played the ward attendant who promised Ray and Jack that they would soon start seeing DT visions of strange animals. When the DT visions appeared (with Mel Blanc providing pig squeals, monkey chatters, and other animal sound effects), Ray chased them off. &quot;Ray, they&#x27;re gone!&quot;, Benny shouted. &quot;What did you do?&quot; Milland replied, &quot;I threw my Oscar at them!&quot;

On April 21, 1949, Jackie Gleason, making his debut as a regular on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Hank Ladd Show&quot; (known prior to that date as &quot;The Arrow Show&quot;, newly recast and retitled accordingly), delivered what &quot;Variety&quot; dubbed the episode&#x27;s &quot;standout segment&quot; with his &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; spoof. Portraying the protagonist as a &quot;five-year-old moppet who gets plastered on soft drinks,&quot; he is seen &quot;guzzling milk shakes and cokes, weaving down Third Avenue and finally, hit by the DT&#x27;s, scared witless by a Mickey Mouse.&quot;
