<text>Illinois ( ) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. It borders on Lake Michigan to its northeast, the Mississippi River to its west, and the Wabash and Ohio rivers to its south. Of the fifty U.S. states, Illinois has the fifth-largest gross domestic product (GDP), the sixth-largest population, and the 25th-most land area. Its capital city is Springfield in the center of the state, and the state&#x27;s largest city is Chicago in the northeast.

Present-day Illinois was inhabited by Indigenous cultures for thousands of years. The French were the first Europeans to arrive, settling near the Mississippi and Illinois River in the 17th century Illinois Country, as part of their sprawling colony of New France. A century later, the revolutionary war Illinois campaign prefigured American involvement in the region. Following U.S. independence in 1783, which made the Mississippi River the national boundary, American settlers began arriving from Kentucky via the Ohio River. Illinois was soon part of the United States&#x27; oldest territory, the Northwest Territory, and in 1818 it achieved statehood. The Erie Canal brought increased commercial activity in the Great Lakes, and the invention of the self-scouring steel plow by Illinoisan John Deere turned the state&#x27;s rich prairie into some of the world&#x27;s most productive and valuable farmland, attracting immigrant farmers from Germany, Sweden and elsewhere. In the mid-19th century, the Illinois and Michigan Canal and a sprawling railroad network facilitated trade, commerce, and settlement, making the state a transportation hub for the nation. By 1900, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and coal mining in the central and southern areas attracted immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. Illinois became one of America&#x27;s most industrialized states and remains a major manufacturing center. The Great Migration from the South established a large Black community, particularly in Chicago, which became a leading cultural, economic, and population center; its metropolitan area, informally referred to as Chicagoland, holds about 65% of the state&#x27;s 12.8 million residents.

Two World Heritage Sites are in Illinois, the ancient Cahokia Mounds, and part of the Wright architecture site. A wide variety of protected areas seek to conserve Illinois&#x27; natural and cultural resources. Major centers of learning include the University of Chicago, University of Illinois, and Northwestern University. Three U.S. presidents have been elected while residents of Illinois: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Barack Obama; additionally, Ronald Reagan was born and raised in the state. Illinois honors Lincoln with its official state slogan &quot;Land of Lincoln&quot;. The state is the site of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield and the future home of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.

Illinois has a highly diverse economy, with the global city of Chicago in the northeast, major industrial and agricultural hubs in the north and center, and natural resources such as coal, timber, and petroleum in the south. Owing to its central location and favorable geography, the state is a major transportation hub: the Port of Chicago has access to the Atlantic Ocean through the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway and to the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River via the Illinois Waterway. Chicago has been the nation&#x27;s railroad hub since the 1860s, and its O&#x27;Hare International Airport has been among the world&#x27;s busiest airports for decades. Illinois has long been considered a microcosm of the United States and a bellwether in American culture, exemplified by the phrase &quot;Will it play in Peoria?&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Illinois&quot; is the modern spelling for the early French Catholic missionaries and explorers&#x27; name for the Illinois Native Americans, a name that was spelled in many different ways in the early records.

American scholars previously thought the name &quot;Illinois&quot; meant &#x27;man&#x27; or &#x27;men&#x27; in the Miami-Illinois language, with the original transformed via French into Illinois. This etymology is not supported by the Illinois language, as the word for &quot;man&quot; is , and plural of &quot;man&quot; is . The name has also been said to mean &#x27;tribe of superior men&#x27;, which is a false etymology. The name &quot;Illinois&quot; derives from the Miami-Illinois verb &#x27;he speaks the regular way&#x27;. This was taken into the Ojibwe language, perhaps in the Ottawa dialect, and modified into (pluralized as ). The French borrowed these forms, spelling the ending as , a transliteration of that sound in the French of that time. The current spelling form, &quot;Illinois&quot;, began to appear in the early 1670s, when French colonists had settled in the western area. The Illinois&#x27;s name for themselves, as attested in all three of the French missionary-period dictionaries of Illinois, was , of unknown meaning and unrelated to the other terms.

==History==

=== Pre-European ===

American Indians of successive cultures lived along the waterways of the Illinois area for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The Koster Site has been excavated and demonstrates 7,000 years of continuous habitation. Cahokia, the largest regional chiefdom and Urban Center of the Pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, was located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois. They built an urban complex of more than 100 platform and burial mounds, a plaza larger than 35 football fields, and a woodhenge of sacred cedar, all in a planned design expressing the culture&#x27;s cosmology. Monks Mound, the center of the site, is the largest Pre-Columbian structure north of the Valley of Mexico. It is high, long, wide, and covers . It contains about of earth. It was topped by a structure thought to have measured about in length and in width, covered an area , and been as much as high, making its peak above the level of the plaza. The finely crafted ornaments and tools recovered by archaeologists at Cahokia include elaborate ceramics, finely sculptured stonework, carefully embossed and engraved copper and mica sheets, and one funeral blanket for an important chief fashioned from 20,000 shell beads. These artifacts indicate that Cahokia was truly an urban center, with clustered housing, markets, and specialists in toolmaking, hide dressing, potting, jewelry making, shell engraving, weaving and salt making.

The civilization vanished in the 15th century for unknown reasons, but historians and archeologists have speculated that the people depleted the area of resources. Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. According to Suzanne Austin Alchon, &quot;At one site in the central Illinois River valley, one third of all adults died as a result of violent injuries.&quot; The next major power in the region was the Illinois Confederation or Illini, a political alliance. Around the time of European contact in 1673, the Illinois confederation had an estimated population of over 10,000 people. As the Illini declined during the Beaver Wars era, members of the Algonquian-speaking Potawatomi, Miami, Sauk, and other tribes including the Fox (Meskwaki), Iowa, Kickapoo, Mascouten, Piankeshaw, Shawnee, Wea, and Winnebago (Ho-Chunk) came into the area from the east and north around the Great Lakes.

===European exploration and settlement prior to 1800===

French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Illinois River in 1673. Marquette soon after founded a mission at the Grand Village of the Illinois in Illinois Country. In 1680, French explorers under Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti constructed a fort at the site of present-day Peoria, and in 1682, a fort atop Starved Rock in today&#x27;s Starved Rock State Park. French Empire Canadiens came south to settle particularly along the Mississippi River, and Illinois was part of first New France, and then of La Louisiane until 1763, when it passed to the British with their defeat of France in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The small French settlements continued, although many French migrated west to Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis, Missouri, to evade British rule.

A few British soldiers were posted in Illinois, but few British or American settlers moved there, as the Crown made it part of the territory reserved for Indians west of the Appalachians, and then part of the British Province of Quebec. In 1778, George Rogers Clark claimed Illinois County for Virginia. In a compromise, Virginia (and other states that made various claims) ceded the area to the new United States in the 1780s and it became part of the Northwest Territory, administered by the federal government and later organized as states.

===19th century===

====Prior to statehood====

The Illinois-Wabash Company was an early claimant to much of Illinois. The Illinois Territory was created on February 3, 1809, with its capital at Kaskaskia, an early French settlement.

During the discussions leading up to Illinois&#x27;s admission to the Union, the proposed northern boundary of the state was moved twice. The original provisions of the Northwest Ordinance had specified a boundary that would have been tangent to the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Such a boundary would have left Illinois with no shoreline on Lake Michigan at all. However, as Indiana had successfully been granted a northern extension of its boundary to provide it with a usable lakefront, the original bill for Illinois statehood, submitted to Congress on January 23, 1818, stipulated a northern border at the same latitude as Indiana&#x27;s, which is defined as 10 miles north of the southernmost extremity of Lake Michigan. However, the Illinois delegate, Nathaniel Pope, wanted more, and lobbied to have the boundary moved further north. The final bill passed by Congress included an amendment to shift the border to 42¬∞ 30&#x27; north, which is approximately north of the Indiana northern border. This shift added to the state, including the lead mining region near Galena. More importantly, it added nearly 50 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline and the Chicago River. Pope and others envisioned a canal that would connect the Chicago and Illinois rivers and thus connect the Great Lakes to the Mississippi.

====The State of Illinois prior to the Civil War====

In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. The capital remained at Kaskaskia, headquartered in a small building rented by the state. In 1819, Vandalia became the capital, and over the next 18 years, three separate buildings were built to serve successively as the capitol building. In 1837, the state legislators representing Sangamon County, under the leadership of state representative Abraham Lincoln, succeeded in having the capital moved to Springfield, where a fifth capitol building was constructed. A sixth capitol building was erected in 1867, which continues to serve as the Illinois capitol today.

Though it was ostensibly a &quot;free state&quot;, there was nonetheless slavery in Illinois. The ethnic French had owned black slaves since the 1720s, and American settlers had already brought slaves into the area from Kentucky. Slavery was nominally banned by the Northwest Ordinance, but that was not enforced for those already holding slaves. When Illinois became a state in 1818, the Ordinance no longer applied, and about 900 slaves were held in the state. As the southern part of the state, later known as &quot;Egypt&quot; or &quot;Little Egypt&quot;, was largely settled by migrants from the South, the section was hostile to free blacks. Edward Coles, the second Governor of Illinois who was born in Virginia, participated in a campaign to block extending existing slavery in Illinois after winning the 1822 Illinois gubernatorial election. In 1824, state residents voted against making slavery legal by a vote of 6640 against to 4972 for.

Still, most residents opposed allowing free blacks as permanent residents. Some settlers brought in slaves seasonally or as house servants. The Illinois Constitution of 1848 was written with a provision for exclusionary laws to be passed. In 1853, John A. Logan helped pass a law to prohibit all African Americans, including freedmen, from settling in the state.

The winter of 1830‚Äì1831 is called the &quot;Winter of the Deep Snow&quot;; a sudden, deep snowfall blanketed the state, making travel impossible for the rest of the winter, and many travelers perished. Several severe winters followed, including the &quot;Winter of the Sudden Freeze&quot;. On December 20, 1836, a fast-moving cold front passed through, freezing puddles in minutes and killing many travelers who could not reach shelter. The adverse weather resulted in crop failures in the northern part of the state. The southern part of the state shipped food north, and this may have contributed to its name, &quot;Little Egypt&quot;, after the Biblical story of Joseph in Egypt supplying grain to his brothers.

In 1832, the Black Hawk War was fought in Illinois and present-day Wisconsin between the United States and the Sauk, Fox (Meskwaki), and Kickapoo Indian tribes. It represents the end of Indian resistance to white settlement in the Chicago region. The Indians had been forced to leave their homes and move to Iowa in 1831; when they attempted to return, they were attacked and eventually defeated by U.S. militia. The survivors were forced back to Iowa. By 1832, when the last Indian lands in Illinois were ceded to the United States, the indigenous population of the state had been reduced by infectious diseases, warfare, and forced westward removal to only one village with fewer than 300 inhabitants.

By 1839, the Latter Day Saints had founded a utopian city called Nauvoo, formerly called Commerce. Located in Hancock County along the Mississippi River, Nauvoo flourished and, by 1844, briefly surpassed Chicago for the position of the state&#x27;s largest city. But in that same year, the Latter Day Saint movement founder, Joseph Smith, was killed in the Carthage Jail, about 30 miles away from Nauvoo. Following a succession crisis, Brigham Young led most Latter Day Saints out of Illinois in a mass exodus to present-day Utah; after close to six years of rapid development, Nauvoo quickly declined afterward.

After it was established in 1833, Chicago gained prominence as a Great Lakes port, and then as an Illinois and Michigan Canal port after 1848, and as a rail hub soon afterward. By 1857, Chicago was Illinois&#x27;s largest city. With the tremendous growth of mines and factories in the state in the 19th century, Illinois was the ground for the formation of labor unions in the United States.

In 1847, after lobbying by Dorothea L. Dix, Illinois became one of the first states to establish a system of state-supported treatment of mental illness and disabilities, replacing local almshouses. Dix came into this effort after having met J. O. King, a Jacksonville, Illinois businessman, who invited her to Illinois, where he had been working to build an asylum for the insane. With the lobbying expertise of Dix, plans for the Jacksonville State Hospital (now known as the Jacksonville Developmental Center) were signed into law on March 1, 1847.

====Civil War and after====

During the American Civil War, Illinois ranked fourth in soldiers who served (more than 250,000) in the Union Army, a figure surpassed by only New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Beginning with President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s first call for troops and continuing throughout the war, Illinois mustered 150 infantry regiments, which were numbered from the 7th to the 156th regiments. Seventeen cavalry regiments were also gathered, as well as two light artillery regiments. The town of Cairo, at the southern tip of the state at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, served as a strategically important supply base and training center for the Union army. For several months, both General Grant and Admiral Foote had headquarters in Cairo.

During the Civil War, and more so afterwards, Chicago&#x27;s population skyrocketed, which increased its prominence. The Pullman Strike and Haymarket Riot, in particular, greatly influenced the development of the American labor movement. From Sunday, October 8, 1871, until Tuesday, October 10, 1871, the Great Chicago Fire burned in downtown Chicago, destroying .

===20th century===
At the turn of the 20th century, Illinois had a population of nearly 5¬†million. Many people from other parts of the country were attracted to the state by employment caused by the expanding industrial base. Whites were 98% of the state&#x27;s population. Bolstered by continued immigration from southern and eastern Europe, and by the African-American Great Migration from the South, Illinois grew and emerged as one of the most important states in the union. By the end of the century, the population had reached 12.4¬†million.

The Century of Progress World&#x27;s fair was held at Chicago in 1933. Oil strikes in Marion County and Crawford County led to a boom in 1937, and by 1939, Illinois ranked fourth in U.S. oil production. Illinois manufactured 6.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War¬†II, ranking seventh among the 48 states. Chicago became an ocean port with the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959. The seaway and the Illinois Waterway connected Chicago to both the Mississippi River and the Atlantic Ocean. In 1960, Ray Kroc opened the first McDonald&#x27;s franchise in Des Plaines, which was demolished in 1984. In 1985 a replica was built on the same site to recreate how the original one looked. Though this replica was demolished in 2017, due to repeated flooding of the building.

Illinois had a prominent role in the emergence of the nuclear age. In 1942, as part of the Manhattan Project, the University of Chicago conducted the first sustained nuclear chain reaction. In 1957, Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago, activated the first experimental nuclear power generating system in the United States. By 1960, the first privately financed nuclear plant in the United States, Dresden 1, was dedicated near Morris. In 1967, Fermilab, a national nuclear research facility near Batavia, opened a particle accelerator, which was the world&#x27;s largest for over 40 years. With eleven plants currently operating, Illinois leads all states in the amount of electricity generated from nuclear power.

In 1961, Illinois became the first state in the nation to adopt the recommendation of the American Law Institute and pass a comprehensive criminal code revision that repealed the law against sodomy. The code also abrogated common law crimes and established an age of consent of 18. The state&#x27;s fourth constitution was adopted in 1970, replacing the 1870 document.

The first Farm Aid concert was held in Champaign to benefit American farmers, in 1985. The worst upper Mississippi River flood of the century, the Great Flood of 1993, inundated many towns and thousands of acres of farmland.

===21st century===

Illinois entered the 21st century under Republican Governor George Ryan. Near the end of his term in January 2003, following a string of high-profile exonerations, Ryan commuted all death sentences in the state.

The 2002 election brought Democrat Rod Blagojevich to the governor&#x27;s mansion. It also brought future president Barack Obama into a committee leadership position in the Illinois Senate, where he drafted the Health Care Justice Act, a forerunner of the Affordable Care Act. Obama&#x27;s election to the presidency in Blagojevich&#x27;s second term set off a chain of events culminating in Blagojevich&#x27;s impeachment, trial, and subsequent criminal conviction and imprisonment, making Blagojevich the second consecutive Illinois governor to be convicted on federal corruption charges.

Blagojevich&#x27;s replacement Pat Quinn was defeated by Republican Bruce Rauner in the 2014 election. Disagreements between the governor and legislature over budgetary policy led to the Illinois Budget Impasse, a 793-day period stretching from 2015 to 2018 in which the state had no budget and struggled to pay its bills.

On August 28, 2017, Rauner signed a bill into law that prohibited state and local police from arresting anyone solely due to their immigration status or due to federal detainers. Some fellow Republicans criticized Rauner for his action, claiming the bill made Illinois a sanctuary state.

In the 2018 election, Rauner was replaced by J. B. Pritzker, returning the state government to a Democratic trifecta. In January 2020 the state legalized marijuana. On March 9, 2020, Pritzker issued a disaster proclamation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He ended the state of emergency in May 2023.

==Geology==

During the early part of the Paleozoic Era, the area that would one day become Illinois was submerged beneath a shallow sea and located near the Equator. Diverse marine life lived at this time, including trilobites, brachiopods, and crinoids. Changing environmental conditions led to the formation of large coal swamps in the Carboniferous.

Illinois was above sea level for at least part of the Mesozoic, but by its end was again submerged by the Western Interior Seaway. This receded by the Eocene Epoch.

During the Pleistocene Epoch, vast ice sheets covered much of Illinois, with only the Driftless Area remaining exposed. These glaciers carved the basin of Lake Michigan and left behind traces of ancient glacial lakes and moraines.

==Geography==


Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States and is one of the eight states in the Great Lakes region of North America (which also includes Ontario, Canada).

===Boundaries===

Illinois&#x27;s eastern border with Indiana consists of a north‚Äìsouth line at 87¬∞‚Ää31‚Ä≤‚Ää30‚Ä≥ west longitude in Lake Michigan at the north, to the Wabash River in the south above Post Vincennes. The Wabash River continues as the eastern/southeastern border with Indiana until the Wabash enters the Ohio River. This marks the beginning of Illinois&#x27;s southern border with Kentucky, which runs along the northern shoreline of the Ohio River. Most of the western border with Missouri and Iowa is the Mississippi River; Kaskaskia is an exclave of Illinois, lying west of the Mississippi and reachable only from Missouri. The state&#x27;s northern border with Wisconsin is fixed at 42¬∞‚Ää30‚Ä≤ north latitude. The northeastern border of Illinois lies in Lake Michigan, within which Illinois shares a water boundary with the state of Michigan, as well as Wisconsin and Indiana.

===Topography===

Though Illinois lies entirely in the Interior Plains, it does have some minor variation in its elevation. In extreme northwestern Illinois, the Driftless Area, a region of unglaciated and therefore higher and more rugged topography, occupies a small part of the state. Southern Illinois includes the hilly areas around the Shawnee National Forest.

Charles Mound, located in the Driftless region, has the state&#x27;s highest natural elevation above sea level at . Other highlands include the Shawnee Hills in the south, and there is varying topography along its rivers; the Illinois River bisects the state northeast to southwest. The floodplain on the Mississippi River from Alton to the Kaskaskia River is known as the American Bottom.

===Divisions===

Illinois has three major geographical divisions. Northern Illinois is dominated by Chicago metropolitan area, or Chicagoland, which is the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, and has a population of over 9.8¬†million. Chicago itself is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, the transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups. The city of Rockford, Illinois&#x27;s third-largest city and center of the state&#x27;s fourth largest metropolitan area, sits along Interstates 39 and 90 some northwest of Chicago. The Quad Cities region, located along the Mississippi River in northern Illinois, had a population of 381,342 in 2011.

The midsection of Illinois is the second major division, called Central Illinois. Historically prairie, it is now mainly agricultural and known as the Heart of Illinois. It is characterized by small towns and medium‚Äìsmall cities. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the Military Tract of 1812 and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state. Agriculture, particularly corn and soybeans, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently in Central Illinois. Cities include Peoria; Springfield, the state capital; Quincy; Decatur; Bloomington-Normal; and Champaign-Urbana.

The third division is Southern Illinois, comprising the area south of U.S. Route 50, including Little Egypt, near the juncture of the Mississippi River and Ohio River. Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of Cahokia, as well as the site of the first state capital at Kaskaskia, which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River. This region has a somewhat warmer winter climate, different variety of crops (including some cotton farming in the past), more rugged topography (due to the area remaining unglaciated during the Illinoian Stage, unlike most of the rest of the state), as well as small-scale oil deposits and coal mining. The Illinois suburbs of St. Louis, such as East St. Louis, are located in this region, and collectively, they are known as the Metro-East. The other somewhat significant concentration of population in Southern Illinois is the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area centered on Carbondale and Marion, a two-county area that is home to 123,272 residents. A portion of southeastern Illinois is part of the extended Evansville, Indiana, Metro Area, locally referred to as the Tri-State with Indiana and Kentucky. Seven Illinois counties are in the area.

In addition to these three, largely latitudinally defined divisions, all of the region outside the Chicago metropolitan area is often called &quot;downstate&quot; Illinois. This term is flexible, but is generally meant to mean everything outside the influence of the Chicago area. Thus, some cities in &quot;Northern&quot; Illinois, such as DeKalb, which is west of Chicago, and Rockford‚Äîwhich is actually north of Chicago‚Äîare sometimes incorrectly considered to be &#x27;downstate&#x27;.

===Climate===


Illinois has a climate that varies widely throughout the year. Because of its nearly 400-mile distance between its northernmost and southernmost extremes, as well as its mid-continental situation, most of Illinois has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;), with hot, humid summers and cold winters. The southern part of the state, from about Carbondale southward, has a humid subtropical climate (Koppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with more moderate winters. Average yearly precipitation for Illinois varies from just over at the southern tip to around in the northern portion of the state. Normal annual snowfall exceeds in the Chicago area, while the southern portion of the state normally receives less than . The all-time high temperature was , recorded on July 14, 1954, at East St. Louis, and the all-time low temperature was , recorded on January 31, 2019, during the January 2019 North American cold wave at a weather station near Mount Carroll, and confirmed on March 5, 2019. This followed the previous record of recorded on January 5, 1999, near Congerville. Prior to the Mount Carroll record, a temperature of was recorded on January 15, 2009, at Rochelle, but at a weather station not subjected to the same quality control as official records.

Illinois averages approximately 51 days of thunderstorm activity a year, which ranks somewhat above average in the number of thunderstorm days for the United States. Illinois is vulnerable to tornadoes, with an average of 54 occurring annually, which puts much of the state at around five tornadoes per annually. Some of Tornado Alley&#x27;s deadliest tornadoes on record have occurred in the state. The Tri-State Tornado of 1925 killed 695 people in three states; 613 of the victims died in Illinois.

===Urban areas===
Chicago is the largest city in the state and the third-most populous city in the United States, with a population of 2,746,388 in 2020. Furthermore, over 7 million residents of the Chicago metropolitan area reside in Illinois. The U.S. Census Bureau currently lists seven other cities with populations of over 100,000 within the state. This includes the Chicago satellite towns of Aurora, Joliet, Naperville, and Elgin, as well as the cities of Rockford, the most populous city in the state outside of the Chicago area; Springfield, the state&#x27;s capital; and Peoria.

The most populated city in the state south of Springfield is Belleville, with 42,000 residents. It is located in the Metro East region of Greater St. Louis, the second-most populous urban area in Illinois with over 700,000 residents. Other major urban areas include the Peoria metropolitan area, Rockford metropolitan area, Champaign‚ÄìUrbana metropolitan area (home to the University of Illinois), Springfield metropolitan area, the Illinois portion of the Quad Cities area, and the Bloomington‚ÄìNormal metropolitan area.

==Demographics==

The United States Census Bureau found that the population of Illinois was 12,812,508 in the 2020 United States census, moving from the fifth-largest state to the sixth-largest state (losing out to Pennsylvania). Illinois&#x27; population slightly declined in 2020 from the 2010 United States census by just over 18,000 residents and the overall population was quite higher than recent census estimates.Illinois is the most populous state in the Midwest region. Chicago, the third-most populous city in the United States, is the center of the Chicago metropolitan area or Chicagoland, as this area is nicknamed. Although the Chicago metropolitan area comprises only 9% of the land area of the state, it contains 65% of the state&#x27;s residents, with 21.4% of Illinois&#x27; population living in the city of Chicago itself as of 2020. The losses of population anticipated from the 2020 census results do not arise from the Chicago metro area; rather the declines are from the Downstate counties. As of the 2020 census, the state&#x27;s geographic mean center of population is located at 41¬∞ 18‚Ä≤ 43‚Ä≥N 88¬∞ 22 23‚Ä≥W in Grundy County, about six miles northwest of Coal City.

Illinois is the most racially and ethnically diverse state in the Midwest. By several metrics, including racial and ethnic background, religious affiliation, and percentage of rural and urban divide, Illinois is the most representative of the larger demography of the United¬†States.

=== Race and ethnicity ===

==== 2020 census ====


==== 2023 American Community Survey ====
According to 2023 U.S. Census Bureau estimates (with Hispanics allocated amongst the various racial groups), Illinois&#x27; population was 60.7% White, 13.3% Black or African American, 0.1% Native American or Alaskan Native, 6.0% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 8.1% Some Other Race, and 11.8% from two or more races. The white population continues to remain the largest racial category in Illinois. Under this methodology, Hispanics are allocated amongst the various racial groups and primarily identify as Some Other Race (40.9%) or Multiracial (39.2%) with the remainder identifying as White (15.0%), Black (1.2%), American Indian and Alaskan Native (3.2%), Asian (0.5%), and Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (0.1%). By ethnicity, 19.0% of the total population is Hispanic-Latino (of any race) and 81.0% is Non-Hispanic (of any race). If treated as a separate category, Hispanics are the largest minority group in Illinois.

, 50% of Illinois&#x27;s population younger than age 4 were minorities (Note: Children born to white Hispanics or to a sole full or partial minority parent are counted as minorities).

The state&#x27;s most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, has declined from 83.5% in 1970 to 58.5% in 2022. Almost 60% of Illinois&#x27; minority population, including over 67% of the black population, lives in Cook County, while the county includes around 40% of the state&#x27;s total population. Cook County, which is home to Chicago, is the only majority-minority county within Illinois, with non-Hispanic whites making up a plurality of 40.4% of the population. In 2020, 96,498 identified as being Native American alone, while 184,487 did in combination with one or more other races. Over half of this demographic also identified as being Hispanic or Latino.

=== Ancestry ===
According to 2022 estimates from the American Community Survey, 16% of the population had German ancestry, 14% had Mexican ancestry, 10.4% had Irish ancestry, 7.1% had English ancestry, 6.2% had Polish ancestry, 5.2% had Italian ancestry, 3.4% listed themselves as American, 2.3% had Indian ancestry, 1.7% had Puerto Rican ancestry, 1.7% had Swedish ancestry, 1.4% had Filipino ancestry, 1.4% had French ancestry, and 1.2% had Chinese ancestry. The state also has a large population of African-Americans, making up 15.3% of the population alone or in combination.
This table displays all self-reported ancestries with over 50,000 members in Illinois, alone or in combination, according to estimates from the 2022 American Community Survey. Hispanic groups are not distinguished between total and partial ancestry:

The median age in Illinois is 39.1 years. Females made up approximately 50.5% of the population, while males made up 49.5%. According to a 2022 study from the Williams Institute, an estimated 0.44% of adults in Illinois identify as transgender, a rate slightly lower than the national estimate of 0.52%. According to a Gallup survey from 2019, 4.3% of adults in Illinois identify as LGBTQ.
=== Socioeconomics ===
As of 2022, the per-capita income in Illinois is $43,317, and the median income for a household in the state is $76,708, slightly higher than the national average. 11.9% of the population lives below the poverty line, including 16% of children under 18 and 10% of those over the age of 65. There are 5,056,360 households in Illinois, with an average size of 2.4 people per household. 90.4% of the adult population has a high school diploma, and 37.7% of the population over 25 has a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, compared to a national average of 35.7%.

In 2021, Illinois scored 0.929 on the UN&#x27;s Human Development Index, placing it in the category of &quot;very high&quot; Human Development and slightly higher than the US average of 0.921.

According to HUD&#x27;s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 9,212 homeless people in Illinois.

===Birth data by race/ethnicity===
&quot;Births do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and by race.&quot;
* Since 2016, data for births of Hispanic origin are not collected by race, but included in one &quot;Hispanic&quot; group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.

===Languages===
The official language of Illinois is English, although between 1923 and 1969, state law gave official status to &quot;the American language&quot;. Nearly 80% of people in Illinois speak English natively, and most of the rest speak it fluently as a second language. A number of dialects of American English are spoken, ranging from Inland Northern American English and African-American English around Chicago, to Midland American English in Central Illinois, to Southern American English in the far south.

Over 23% of Illinoians speak a language other than English at home, of which Spanish is by far the most widespread, at more than 13% of the total population. A sizeable number of Polish speakers is present in the Chicago Metropolitan Area. Illinois Country French has mostly gone extinct in Illinois, although it is still celebrated in the French Colonial Historic District.
===Religion===
====Christianity====
Roman Catholics constitute the single largest religious denomination in Illinois; they are heavily concentrated in and around Chicago and account for nearly 30% of the state&#x27;s population. However, taken together as a group, the various Protestant denominations comprise a greater percentage of the state&#x27;s population than do Catholics. In 2010, Catholics in Illinois numbered 3,648,907. The largest Protestant denominations were the United Methodist Church with 314,461 members and the Southern Baptist Convention with 283,519. Illinois has one of the largest concentrations of Missouri Synod Lutherans in the United States.

Illinois played an important role in the early Latter Day Saint movement, with Nauvoo becoming a gathering place for Mormons in the early 1840s. Nauvoo was the location of the succession crisis, which led to the separation of the Mormon movement into several Latter Day Saint sects. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the largest of the sects to emerge from the Mormon schism, has more than 55,000 adherents in Illinois today.

====Other Abrahamic religious communities====

A significant number of adherents of other Abrahamic faiths can be found in Illinois. Largely concentrated in the Chicago metropolitan area, followers of the Muslim, Bah√° º√≠, and Jewish religions all call the state home. Muslims constituted the largest non-Christian group, with 359,264 adherents. Illinois has the largest concentration of Muslims by state in the country, with 2,800 Muslims per 100,000 citizens.

The largest and oldest surviving Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in the world is located on the shores of Lake Michigan in Wilmette, Illinois, one of eight continental Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship. It serves as a space for people of all backgrounds and religions to gather, meditate, reflect, and pray, expressing the Bah√° º√≠ principle of the oneness of religions. The Chicago area has a very large Jewish community, particularly in the suburbs of Skokie, Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and surrounding suburbs. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was the Windy City&#x27;s first Jewish mayor.

====Other religions====
Chicago is also home to a very large population of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists.

==Economy==

As of 2022, the gross state product for Illinois reached ¬†trillion.

As of February 2019, the unemployment rate in Illinois reached 4.2%.

Illinois&#x27;s minimum wage will rise to $15 per hour by 2025, making it one of the highest in the nation.

===Agriculture===
Illinois&#x27;s major agricultural outputs are corn, soybeans, hogs, cattle, dairy products, and wheat. In most years, Illinois is either the first or second state for the highest production of soybeans, with a harvest of 427.7¬†million bushels (11.64¬†million metric tons) in 2008, after Iowa&#x27;s production of 444.82¬†million bushels (12.11¬†million metric tons). Illinois ranks second in U.S. corn production with more than 1.5¬†billion bushels produced annually. With a production capacity of 1.5¬†billion gallons per year, Illinois is a top producer of ethanol, ranking third in the United States in 2011. Illinois is a leader in food manufacturing and meat processing. Although Chicago may no longer be &quot;Hog Butcher for the World&quot;, the Chicago area remains a global center for food manufacture and meat processing, with many plants, processing houses, and distribution facilities concentrated in the area of the former Union Stock Yards. Illinois also produces wine, and the state is home to two American viticultural areas. In the area of The Meeting of the Great Rivers Scenic Byway, peaches and apples are grown. The German immigrants from agricultural backgrounds who settled in Illinois in the mid- to late 19th century are in part responsible for the profusion of fruit orchards in that area of Illinois. Illinois&#x27;s universities are actively researching alternative agricultural products as alternative crops.

===Manufacturing===
Illinois is one of the nation&#x27;s manufacturing leaders, boasting annual value added productivity by manufacturing of over $107¬†billion in 2006. , Illinois is ranked as the 4th-most productive manufacturing state in the country, behind California, Texas, and Ohio. About three-quarters of the state&#x27;s manufacturers are located in the Northeastern Opportunity Return Region, with 38 percent of Illinois&#x27;s approximately 18,900 manufacturing plants located in Cook County. As of 2006, the leading manufacturing industries in Illinois, based upon value-added, were chemical manufacturing ($18.3¬†billion), machinery manufacturing ($13.4¬†billion), food manufacturing ($12.9¬†billion), fabricated metal products ($11.5¬†billion), transportation equipment ($7.4¬†billion), plastics and rubber products ($7.0¬†billion), and computer and electronic products ($6.1¬†billion).

===Services===

By the early 2000s, Illinois&#x27;s economy had moved toward a dependence on high-value-added services, such as financial trading, higher education, law, logistics, and medicine. In some cases, these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois&#x27;s earlier economies. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a trading exchange for global derivatives, had begun its life as an agricultural futures market. Other important non-manufacturing industries include publishing, tourism, and energy production and distribution.

===Investments===
Venture capitalists funded a total of approximately $62¬†billion in the U.S. economy in 2016. Of this amount, Illinois-based companies received approximately $1.1¬†billion. Similarly, in FY 2016, the federal government spent $461¬†billion on contracts in the U.S. Of this amount, Illinois-based companies received approximately $8.7¬†billion.

===Energy===

Illinois is a net importer of fuels for energy, despite large coal resources and some minor oil production. Illinois exports electricity, ranking fifth among states in electricity production and seventh in electricity consumption.

====Coal====

The coal industry of Illinois has its origins in the middle 19th century, when entrepreneurs such as Jacob Loose discovered coal in locations such as Sangamon County. Jacob Bunn contributed to the development of the Illinois coal industry and was a founder and owner of the Western Coal &amp; Mining Company of Illinois. About 68% of Illinois has coal-bearing strata of the Pennsylvanian geologic period. According to the Illinois State Geological Survey, 211¬†billion tons of bituminous coal are estimated to lie under the surface, having a total heating value greater than the estimated oil deposits in the Arabian Peninsula. However, this coal has a high sulfur content, which causes acid rain, unless special equipment is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. Many Illinois power plants are not equipped to burn high-sulfur coal. In 1999, Illinois produced 40.4¬†million tons of coal, but only 17¬†million tons (42%) of Illinois coal was consumed in Illinois. Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states and countries. In 2008, Illinois exported three million tons of coal and was projected to export nine million in 2011, as demand for energy grows in places such as China, India, and elsewhere in Asia and Europe. , Illinois was ranked third in recoverable coal reserves at producing mines in the nation. Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states, while much of the coal burned for power in Illinois (21¬†million tons in 1998) is mined in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.

Mattoon was chosen as the site for the Department of Energy&#x27;s FutureGen project, a 275-megawatt experimental zero emission coal-burning power plant that the DOE just gave a second round of funding. In 2010, after a number of setbacks, the city of Mattoon backed out of the project.

====Petroleum====
Illinois is a leading refiner of petroleum in the American Midwest, with a combined crude oil distillation capacity of nearly . However, Illinois has very limited crude oil proved reserves that account for less than 1% of the U.S. total reserves. Residential heating is 81% natural gas compared to less than 1% heating oil. Illinois is ranked 14th in oil production among states, with a daily output of approximately in 2005.

====Nuclear power====
Nuclear power arguably began in Illinois with the Chicago Pile-1, the world&#x27;s first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in the world&#x27;s first nuclear reactor, built on the University of Chicago campus. There are six operating nuclear power plants in Illinois: Braidwood, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, LaSalle, and Quad Cities. With the exception of the single-unit Clinton plant, each of these facilities has two reactors. Three reactors have been permanently shut down and are in various stages of decommissioning: Dresden-1 and Zion-1 and 2. Illinois ranked first in the nation in 2010 in both nuclear capacity and nuclear generation. Generation from its nuclear power plants accounted for 12 percent of the nation&#x27;s total. In 2007, 48% of Illinois&#x27;s electricity was generated using nuclear power. The Morris Operation is the only de facto high-level radioactive waste storage site in the United States.

====Wind power====
Illinois has seen growing interest in the use of wind power for electrical generation. Most of Illinois was rated in 2009 as &quot;marginal or fair&quot; for wind energy production by the U.S. Department of Energy, with some western sections rated &quot;good&quot; and parts of the south rated &quot;poor&quot;. These ratings are for wind turbines with hub heights; newer wind turbines are taller, enabling them to reach stronger winds farther from the ground. As a result, more areas of Illinois have become prospective wind farm sites. As of September 2009, Illinois had 1116.06 MW of installed wind power nameplate capacity with another 741.9 MW under construction. Illinois ranked ninth among U.S. states in installed wind power capacity and sixteenth by potential capacity. Large wind farms in Illinois include Twin Groves, Rail Splitter, EcoGrove, and Mendota Hills.

As of 2007, wind energy represented only 1.7% of Illinois&#x27;s energy production, and it was estimated that wind power could provide 5‚Äì10% of the state&#x27;s energy needs. Also, the Illinois General Assembly mandated in 2007 that by 2025, 25% of all electricity generated in Illinois is to come from renewable resources.

====Biofuels====
Illinois is ranked second in corn production among U.S. states, and Illinois corn is used to produce 40% of the ethanol consumed in the United States. The Archer Daniels Midland corporation in Decatur, Illinois, is the world&#x27;s leading producer of ethanol from corn.

The National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC), the world&#x27;s only facility dedicated to researching the ways and means of converting corn (maize) to ethanol is located on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.

University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is one of the partners in the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI), a $500¬†million biofuels research project funded by petroleum giant BP.

===Taxes===
Tax is collected by the Illinois Department of Revenue. State income tax is calculated by multiplying net income by a flat rate. In 1990, that rate was set at 3%, but in 2010, the General Assembly voted for a temporary increase in the rate to 5%; the new rate went into effect on January 1, 2011; the personal income rate partially sunset on January 1, 2015, to 3.75%, while the corporate income tax fell to 5.25%. Illinois failed to pass a budget from 2015 to 2017, after the 736-day budget impasse, a budget was passed in Illinois after lawmakers overturned Governor Bruce Rauner&#x27;s veto; this budget raised the personal income rate to 4.95% and the corporate rate to 7%. There are two rates for state sales tax: 6.25% for general merchandise and 1% for qualifying food, drugs, and medical appliances. The property tax is a major source of tax revenue for local government taxing districts. The property tax is a local‚Äînot state‚Äîtax imposed by local government taxing districts, which include counties, townships, municipalities, school districts, and special taxation districts. The property tax in Illinois is imposed only on real property.

On May 1, 2019, the Illinois Senate voted to approve a constitutional amendment that would have stricken language from the Illinois Constitution requiring a flat state income tax, in a 73‚Äì44 vote. If approved, the amendment would have allowed the state legislature to impose a graduated income tax based on annual income. The governor, J. B. Pritzker, approved the bill on May 27, 2019. It was scheduled for a 2020 general election ballot vote and required 60 percent voter approval to effectively amend the state constitution. The amendment was not approved by Illinoisans, with 55.1% of voters voting &quot;No&quot; on approval and 44.9% voting &quot;Yes&quot;.

As of 2017 Chicago had the highest state and local sales tax rate for a U.S. city with a populations above 200,000, at 10.250%. The state of Illinois has the second highest rate of real estate tax: 2.31%, which is second only to New Jersey at 2.44%.

Toll roads are a &quot;de facto&quot; user tax on the citizens and visitors to the state of Illinois. Illinois ranks seventh out of the 11 states with the most miles of toll roads, at 282.1 miles. Chicago ranks fourth in most expensive toll roads in America by the mile, with the Chicago Skyway charging 51.2 cents per mile. Illinois also has the 11th highest gasoline tax by state, at 37.5 cents per gallon.

==Culture==

===Museums===
Illinois has numerous museums; the greatest concentration of these are in Chicago. Several museums in Chicago are ranked as some of the best in the world. These include the John G. Shedd Aquarium, the Field Museum of Natural History, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Adler Planetarium, and the Museum of Science and Industry.

The modern Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield is the largest and most attended presidential library in the country. The Illinois State Museum boasts a collection of 13.5¬†million objects that tell the story of Illinois life, land, people, and art. The ISM is among only 5% of the nation&#x27;s museums that are accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. Other historical museums in the state include the Polish Museum of America in Chicago; Magnolia Manor in Cairo; Easley Pioneer Museum in Ipava; the Elihu Benjamin Washburne; Ulysses S. Grant Homes, both in Galena; and the Chanute Air Museum, located on the former Chanute Air Force Base in Rantoul.

The Chicago metropolitan area also hosts two zoos: The Brookfield Zoo, located about ten miles west of the city center in suburban Brookfield, contains more than 2,300 animals and covers . The Lincoln Park Zoo is located in Lincoln Park on Chicago&#x27;s North Side, approximately north of the Loop. The zoo accounts for more than of the park.

===Music===
Illinois is a leader in music education, having hosted the Midwest Clinic International Band and Orchestra Conference since 1946, as well being home to the Illinois Music Educators Association (ILMEA, formerly IMEA), one of the largest professional music educator&#x27;s organizations in the country. Each summer since 2004, Southern Illinois University Carbondale has played host to the Southern Illinois Music Festival, which presents dozens of performances throughout the region. Past featured artists include the Eroica Trio and violinist David Kim.

Chicago, in the northeast corner of the state, is a major center for music in the midwestern United States where distinctive forms of blues (greatly responsible for the future creation of rock and roll), and house music, a genre of electronic dance music, were developed.

The Great Migration of poor black workers from the South into the industrial cities brought traditional jazz and blues music to the city, resulting in Chicago blues and &quot;Chicago-style&quot; Dixieland jazz. Notable blues artists included Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Howlin&#x27; Wolf and both Sonny Boy Williamsons; jazz greats included Nat King Cole, Gene Ammons, Benny Goodman, and Bud Freeman. Chicago is also well known for its soul music.

In the early 1930s, Gospel music began to gain popularity in Chicago due to Thomas A. Dorsey&#x27;s contributions at Pilgrim Baptist Church.

In the 1980s and 1990s, heavy rock, punk, and hip hop also became popular in Chicago. Orchestras in Chicago include the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and the Chicago Sinfonietta.

===Movies===
John Hughes, who moved from Grosse Pointe to Northbrook, based many films of his in Chicago, and its suburbs. Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off, Home Alone, The Breakfast Club, and all his films take place in the fictional Shermer, Illinois (the original name of Northbrook was Shermerville, and Hughes&#x27;s High School, Glenbrook North High School, is on Shermer Road). Most locations in his films include Glenbrook North, the former Maine North High School, the Ben Rose House in Highland Park, and the famous Home Alone house in Winnetka, Illinois.

===Recreation===

The Illinois state parks system began in 1908 with what is now Fort Massac State Park, becoming the first park in a system encompassing more than 60 parks and about the same number of recreational and wildlife areas.

Areas under the protection of the National Park Service include: the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor near Lockport, the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail, the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail, the American Discovery Trail, the Pullman National Monument, and New Philadelphia Town Site. The federal government also manages the Shawnee National Forest and the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie.

===Sports===


As one of the United States&#x27; major metropolises, all major sports leagues have teams headquartered in Chicago.

Two Major League Baseball teams are located in the state. The Chicago Cubs of the National League play in the second-oldest major league stadium, Wrigley Field, and went the longest length of time without a championship in all of major American sport, from 1908 to 2016, when they won the World Series. The Chicago White Sox of the American League won the World Series in 2005, their first since 1917. They play on the city&#x27;s south side at Rate Field. The Chicago Bears football team has won nine total NFL Championships, the last occurring in Super Bowl¬†XX on January 26, 1986. The Chicago Bulls of the NBA is one of the most recognized basketball teams in the world, largely as a result of the efforts of Michael Jordan, who led the team to six NBA championships in eight seasons in the 1990s. The Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL began playing in 1926 and became a member of the Original Six once the NHL dropped to that number of teams during World War¬†II. The Blackhawks have won six Stanley Cups, most recently in 2015. Chicago Fire FC is a member of MLS and has been one of the league&#x27;s most successful and best-supported clubs since its founding in 1997, winning one league and four Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cups in that timespan. The team played in Bridgeview, adjacent to Chicago from 2006 to 2019. The team now plays at Soldier Field in Chicago.

The Chicago Red Stars have played at the top level of U.S. women&#x27;s soccer since their formation in 2009, except in the 2011 season. The team currently plays in the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League, playing at SeatGeek Stadium, the Bridgeview venue it formerly shared with Fire FC. The Chicago Sky have played in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) since 2006. The Sky won their first WNBA Championship in 2021. They play at Wintrust Arena in Chicago.

They play at Parkway Bank Sports Complex in Rosemont, Illinois, in the Chicago area.

Many minor league teams also call Illinois their home. They include the Bloomington Edge of the Indoor Football League, Bloomington Flex of the Midwest Professional Basketball Association, Chicago Dogs of the American Association of Professional Baseball, Chicago Fire FC II of MLS Next Pro, Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League, Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, Kane County Cougars of the American Association, Joliet Slammers of the Frontier League, Peoria Chiefs of the Midwest League, Peoria Rivermen of the SPHL, Rockford Aviators of the Frontier League, Rockford IceHogs of the AHL, Schaumburg Boomers of the Frontier League, Southern Illinois Miners in the Frontier League, Windy City Bulls of the NBA G League, and Windy City ThunderBolts of the Frontier League.

The state features 13 athletic programs that compete in NCAA Division I, the highest level of U.S. college sports. The two most prominent are the Illinois Fighting Illini and Northwestern Wildcats, both members of the Big Ten Conference and the only ones competing in the &quot;Power Five conferences&quot;. The Fighting Illini football team has won five national championships and three Rose Bowl Games, whereas the men&#x27;s basketball team has won 17 conference seasons and played five Final Fours. Meanwhile, the Wildcats have won eight football conference championships and one Rose Bowl Game. The Northern Illinois Huskies compete in the Mid-American Conference, having won four conference championships and earning a bid in the Orange Bowl. Four schools have football programs that compete in the second level of Division¬†I football, the Football Championship Subdivision. The Illinois State Redbirds and Southern Illinois Salukis are members of the Missouri Valley Conference for non-football sports and the Missouri Valley Football Conference. The Eastern Illinois Panthers and Western Illinois Leathernecks are members of the Ohio Valley Conference. The city of Chicago is home to four Division¬†I programs that do not sponsor football: the DePaul Blue Demons of the Big East Conference, Loyola Ramblers of the Atlantic 10 Conference, UIC Flames of the Missouri Valley Conference, and Chicago State Cougars of the Northeast Conference. Finally, two non-football Division¬†I programs are located downstate. The Bradley Braves are Missouri Valley Conference members, and the SIU Edwardsville Cougars compete in the Ohio Valley Conference.

Motor racing oval tracks at the Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, the Chicago Motor Speedway in Cicero and the Gateway Motorsports Park in Madison, near St. Louis, have hosted NASCAR, CART, and IRL races, whereas the Sports Car Club of America, among other national and regional road racing clubs, have visited the Autobahn Country Club in Joliet, the Blackhawk Farms Raceway in South Beloit and the former Meadowdale International Raceway in Carpentersville. Illinois also has several short tracks and dragstrips. The dragstrip at Gateway International Raceway and the Route 66 Raceway, which sits on the same property as the Chicagoland Speedway, both host NHRA drag races.

Illinois features several golf courses, such as Olympia Fields, Medinah, Midlothian, Cog Hill, and Conway Farms, which have often hosted the BMW Championship, Western Open, and Women&#x27;s Western Open. Also, the state has hosted 13 editions of the U.S. Open (latest at Olympia Fields in 2003), six editions of the PGA Championship (latest at Medinah in 2006), three editions of the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open (latest at The Merit Club), the 2009 Solheim Cup (at Rich Harvest Farms), and the 2012 Ryder Cup (at Medinah). The John Deere Classic is a regular PGA Tour event played in the Quad Cities since 1971, whereas the Encompass Championship is a Champions Tour event since 2013. Previously, the LPGA State Farm Classic was an LPGA Tour event from 1976 to 2011.

==Law and politics==

In a 2020 study, Illinois was ranked as the 4th easiest state for citizens to vote in.

===State government===
The government of Illinois, under the Constitution of Illinois, has three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch is split into several statewide elected offices, with the governor as chief executive. Legislative functions are granted to the Illinois General Assembly. The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts.

The executive branch is composed of six elected officers and their offices as well as numerous other departments. The six elected officers are: Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Comptroller, and Treasurer. The government of Illinois has numerous departments, agencies, boards and commissions, but the so-called code departments provide most of the state&#x27;s services.
The Illinois General Assembly is the state legislature, composed of the 118-member Illinois House of Representatives and the 59-member Illinois Senate. The members of the General Assembly are elected at the beginning of each even-numbered year. The &quot;Illinois Compiled Statutes&quot; (ILCS) are the codified statutes of a general and permanent nature.

The Judiciary of Illinois is the unified court system of Illinois. It consists of the Supreme Court, Appellate Court, and Circuit Courts. The Supreme Court oversees the administration of the court system.

The administrative divisions of Illinois are counties, townships, precincts, cities, towns, villages, and special-purpose districts. The basic subdivision of Illinois are the 102 counties. Eighty-five of the 102 counties are in turn divided into townships and precincts. Municipal governments are the cities, villages, and incorporated towns. Some localities possess home rule, which allows them to govern themselves to a certain extent.

===Party balance===
In modern national and state politics, Illinois is a Democratic stronghold. Historically, Illinois was a political swing state, with near-parity existing between the Republican and the Democratic parties. However, in recent elections, the Democratic Party has gained ground, and Illinois has come to be seen as a solid &quot;blue&quot; state in both presidential and congressional campaigns. Illinois&#x27;s Democratic tendencies are mostly attributable to Cook County and Chicago, by far the state&#x27;s largest county and city, respectively, which have long been strongly Democratic. The collar counties, affluent suburban counties that surround Cook County, were ancestrally Republican and helped keep the state competitive; however, they have swung toward the left in recent elections as the national Republican Party has become increasingly conservative, which has cemented Democratic dominance in state politics. Outside of the Chicago metropolitan area, the state&#x27;s rural areas are heavily Republican. The dominance of the Chicago area in state elections is so overwhelming that it has influenced a secessionist movement in the downstate region.

Illinois was long seen as a national bellwether, supporting the winner in every election in the 20th century, except for 1916 and 1976. Since the 1992 election, however, Illinois has trended more toward the Democratic Party and is part of the &quot;blue wall&quot; of states that have consistently voted Democratic in the last six presidential elections. In 2000, George W. Bush became the first Republican to win the presidency without carrying either Illinois or Vermont, with Donald Trump repeating the feat in 2016. Illinois has not elected a Republican to the Senate since Mark Kirk won in 2010; the last Republicans to hold statewide office were Governor Bruce Rauner and Lieutenant Governor Evelyn Sanguinetti, who both left office in 2019.

===History of corruption===

Politics in the state have been infamous for highly visible corruption cases, as well as for crusading reformers, such as governors Adlai Stevenson and James R. Thompson. In 2006, former governor George Ryan was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence. On December 7, 2011, former governor Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison for allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President Barack Obama to the highest bidder. Blagojevich had earlier been impeached and convicted by the legislature, resulting in his removal from office. In the late 20th century, Congressman Dan Rostenkowski was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge Otto Kerner, Jr. was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State Paul Powell was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) Orville Hodge was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery, and in 1921, Governor Len Small was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.

===U.S. presidential elections===

Illinois has shown a strong presence in presidential elections. Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base when running for president: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and most recently Barack Obama. Lincoln was born in Kentucky, but he moved to Illinois at age 21. He served in the General Assembly and represented the 7th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives before his election to the presidency in 1860. Ulysses S. Grant was born in Ohio and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the Civil War and approaching middle age, he moved to Illinois and thus utilized the state as his home and political base when running for president. Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and made Illinois his home after graduating from law school, and later represented Illinois in the U.S. Senate. He then became president in 2008, running as a candidate from his Illinois base.

Ronald Reagan was born in Illinois, in the city of Tampico, raised in Dixon, Illinois, and educated at Eureka College, outside Peoria. Reagan later moved to California during his young adulthood. He then became an actor, and later became California&#x27;s Governor before being elected president.

Hillary Clinton was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and became the first woman to represent a major political party in the general election of the U.S. presidency. Clinton ran from a platform based in New York State.

===African-American U.S. senators===

Twelve African-Americans have served as members of the United States Senate. Of which three have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: Carol Moseley-Braun, Barack Obama, and Roland Burris, who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator.

===Political families===

Several families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in politics, in both the Republican Party earlier in the state&#x27;s history but more recently the Democratic Party, gaining both statewide and national fame.

====Ingersoll====

The Ingersoll family of Illinois comprised a pair of brothers who held several prominent elected positions representing Illinois.
* Ebon C. Ingersoll (1831‚Äì1879), Illinois State Representative 1856, U.S. Representative from Illinois 1864‚Äì71. Brother of Robert G. Ingersoll.
* Robert G. Ingersoll (1833‚Äì1899), Illinois State Representative 1860, Attorney General of Illinois 1867‚Äì69, delegate to the Republican National Convention 1876. Brother of Ebon C. Ingersoll.
** John C. Ingersoll (1860‚Äì1903), U.S. Consul in Cartagena, Colombia 1902. Son of Ebon C. Ingersoll.

====Stevenson====

The Stevenson family, initially rooted in central Illinois and later based in the Chicago metropolitan area, has provided four generations of Illinois officeholders.
* Adlai Stevenson I (1835‚Äì1914) was a Vice President of the United States, as well as a Congressman
* Lewis Stevenson (1868‚Äì1929), son of Adlai, served as Illinois Secretary of State.
* Adlai Stevenson II (1900‚Äì1965), son of Lewis, served as Governor of Illinois and as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; he was also the Democratic party&#x27;s presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956, losing both elections to Dwight Eisenhower.
* Adlai Stevenson III (1930‚Äì2021), son of Adlai II, served ten years as a United States Senator.

==Education==

===Illinois State Board of education===
The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers public education in the state. Local municipalities and their respective school districts operate individual public schools, but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the Illinois School Report Card. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies.

===Primary and secondary schools===
Education is compulsory for ages 7‚Äì17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly, but not exclusively, divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, middle school or junior high school, and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in &quot;two&quot; school districts‚Äîone for high school and the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts.

===Colleges and universities===

Using the criterion established by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, there are eleven &quot;National Universities&quot; in the state.

, six of these rank in the &quot;first tier&quot; among the top 500 National Universities in the nation, as determined by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings: the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Loyola University Chicago, the Illinois Institute of Technology, DePaul University, University of Illinois Chicago, Illinois State University, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and Northern Illinois University. The University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world&#x27;s top ten universities on various independent university rankings, and its Booth School of Business, along with Northwestern&#x27;s Kellogg School of Management consistently rank within the top five graduate business schools in the country and top ten globally. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is often ranked among the best engineering schools in the world and United States.

Illinois also has more than twenty additional accredited four-year universities, both public and private, and dozens of small liberal arts colleges across the state. Additionally, Illinois supports 49 public community colleges in the Illinois Community College System.

===School financing===
Schools in Illinois are funded primarily by property taxes, based on state assessment of property values, rather than direct state contributions. Scholar Tracy Steffes has described Illinois public education as historically &quot;inequitable&quot;, a system where one of &quot;the wealthiest of states&quot; is &quot;the stingiest in its support for education&quot;. There have been several attempts to reform school funding in Illinois. The most notable attempt came in 1973 with the adoption of the Illinois Resource Equalizer Formula, a measure through which it was hoped funding could be collected and distributed to Illinois schools more equitably. However, opposition from affluent Illinois communities who objected to having to pay for the less well-off school districts (many of them Black majority communities, produced by redlining, white flight, and other &quot;soft&quot; segregation methods) resulted in the formula&#x27;s abolition in the late 1980s.

==Transportation==

Because of its central location and its proximity to the Rust Belt and Grain Belt, Illinois is a national crossroads for air, auto, rail, and truck traffic.

===Airports===

From 1962 until 1998, Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport (ORD) was the busiest airport in the world, measured both in terms of total flights and passengers. While it was surpassed by Atlanta&#x27;s Hartsfield in 1998 (as Chicago splits its air traffic between O&#x27;Hare and Midway airports, while Atlanta uses only one airport), with 59.3¬†million domestic passengers annually, along with 11.4¬†million international passengers in 2008, O&#x27;Hare consistently remains one of the two or three busiest airports globally, and in some years still ranks number one in total flights. It is a major hub for both United Airlines and American Airlines, and a major airport expansion project is currently underway. Midway Airport (MDW), which had been the busiest airport in the world at one point until it was supplanted by O&#x27;Hare as the busiest airport in 1962, is now the secondary airport in the Chicago metropolitan area and still ranks as one of the nation&#x27;s busiest airports. Midway is a major hub for Southwest Airlines and services many other carriers as well. Midway served 17.3¬†million domestic and international passengers in 2008.

===Highways===

The Interstate Highways in Illinois are all segments of the Interstate Highway System that are owned and maintained by the state. Major U.S. Interstate highways crossing the state include: Interstate¬†24 (I-24), I-39, I-41, I-55, I-57, I-64, I-70, I-72, I-74, I-80, I-88, I-90, and I-94.

Illinois has the distinction of having the most primary (two-digit) interstates pass through it among all the 50 states with 13. Illinois also ranks third among the fifty states with the most interstate mileage, coming in after California and Texas, which are much bigger states in area.

The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) is responsible for maintaining the U.S Highways in Illinois. The system in Illinois consists of 21 primary highways. Among the U.S. highways that pass through the state, the primary ones are: US¬†6, US¬†12, US¬†14, US¬†20, US¬†24, US¬†30, US¬†34, US¬†36, US¬†40, US¬†41, US¬†45, US¬†50, US¬†51, US¬†52, US¬†54, US¬†60, US¬†62, and US¬†67.

===Buses===

Due to its central location, Illinois sees numerous intercity bus services primarily connecting east and west. The Chicago Bus Station is the busiest intercity bus station in the state. The following carriers provide scheduled service: Amtrak Thruway, Barons Bus Lines, Burlington Trailways, Flixbus, Greyhound Lines, Indian Trails, Miller Transportation (Hoosier Ride), Peoria Charter Coach Company, Van Galder Bus Company, and Wisconsin Coach Lines.

===Railroads===

Illinois has an extensive passenger and freight rail transportation network. Chicago is a national Amtrak hub and in-state passengers are served by Amtrak&#x27;s Illinois Service, featuring the Chicago to Carbondale &quot;Illini&quot; and &quot;Saluki&quot;, the Chicago to Quincy &quot;Carl Sandburg&quot; and &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot;, and the Chicago to St. Louis &quot;Lincoln Service&quot;. Currently there is trackwork on the Chicago‚ÄìSt. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to , which would reduce the trip time by an hour and a half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago (including all six Class I railroads), making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive heavy rail service is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the Chicago Transit Authority&#x27;s &#x27;L&#x27; system. One of the largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by Metra, uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.

===Waterways===

In addition to the state&#x27;s rail lines, the Mississippi River and Illinois River provide major transportation routes for the state&#x27;s agricultural interests. Lake Michigan gives Illinois access to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

<text>Ian Ashley Murdock (April28, 1973 ‚Äì December 28, 2015) was an American software engineer, known for being the founder of the Debian project and Progeny Linux Systems, a commercial Linux company.

==Life and career==
Although Murdock&#x27;s parents were both from Southern Indiana, he was born in Konstanz, West Germany, on April 28, 1973, where his father was pursuing postdoctoral
research. The family returned to the United States in 1975, and Murdock grew up in Lafayette, Indiana, beginning in 1977 when his father became a professor of entomology at Purdue University. Murdock graduated from Harrison High School in 1991, and then earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science from Purdue in 1996.

While a college student, Murdock founded the Debian project in August 1993, and wrote the Debian Manifesto in January 1994. Murdock conceived Debian as a Linux distribution that embraced open design, contributions, and support from the free software community. He named Debian after his then-girlfriend (later wife) Debra Lynn Roundy, and himself. They later married, had three children, and divorced in January 2008.

In January 2006, Murdock was appointed Chief Technology Officer of the Free Standards Group and elected chair of the Linux Standard Base workgroup. He continued as CTO of the Linux Foundation when the group was formed from the merger of the Free Standards Group and Open Source Development Labs.

Murdock left the Linux Foundation to join Sun Microsystems in March 2007 to lead Project Indiana, which he described as &quot;taking the lesson that Linux has brought to the operating system and providing that for Solaris&quot;, making a full OpenSolaris distribution with GNOME and userland tools from GNU plus a network-based package management system. From March 2007 to February 2010, he was Vice President of Emerging Platforms at Sun, until the company merged with Oracle and he resigned his position with the company.

From 2011 until 2015 Murdock was Vice President of Platform and Developer Community at Salesforce Marketing Cloud, based in Indianapolis.

From November 2015 until his death Murdock was working for Docker, Inc.

==Death==
Murdock died on December 28, 2015, in San Francisco. Though initially no cause of death was released, in July 2016 it was announced his death had been ruled a suicide. The police confirmed that the cause of death was due to asphyxiation caused by hanging himself with a vacuum cleaner electrical cord.

The last tweets from Murdock&#x27;s Twitter account first announced that he would commit suicide, then said he would not. He reported having been accused of assault on a police officer after having been himself assaulted and sexually humiliated by the police, then declared an intent to devote his life to opposing police abuse. His Twitter account was taken down shortly afterwards.

The San Francisco police confirmed he was detained, saying he matched the description in a reported attempted break-in and that he appeared to be drunk. The police stated that he became violent and was ultimately taken to jail on suspicion of four misdemeanor counts. They added that he did not appear to be suicidal and was medically examined prior to release. Later, police returned on reports of a possible suicide. The city medical examiner&#x27;s office confirmed Murdock was found dead.

The autopsy report noted extensive bruise marks found on Murdock&#x27;s body, and a medical history of alcohol abuse and psychological disorders; namely Asperger syndrome.

<doc id="14856" wikidata="Q214159" url="?curid=14856" title="Inner product space">
<text>In mathematics, an inner product space (or, rarely, a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] pre-Hilbert space) is a real vector space or a complex vector space with an operation called an inner product. The inner product of two vectors in the space is a scalar, often denoted with angle brackets such as in formula_1. Inner products allow formal definitions of intuitive geometric notions, such as lengths, angles, and orthogonality (zero inner product) of vectors. Inner product spaces generalize Euclidean vector spaces, in which the inner product is the dot product or &quot;scalar product&quot; of Cartesian coordinates. Inner product spaces of infinite dimension are widely used in functional analysis. Inner product spaces over the field of complex numbers are sometimes referred to as unitary spaces. The first usage of the concept of a vector space with an inner product is due to Giuseppe Peano, in 1898.

An inner product naturally induces an associated norm, (denoted formula_2 and formula_3 in the picture); so, every inner product space is a normed vector space. If this normed space is also complete (that is, a Banach space) then the inner product space is a Hilbert space. If an inner product space is not a Hilbert space, it can be &quot;extended&quot; by completion to a Hilbert space formula_4 This means that formula_5 is a linear subspace of formula_6 the inner product of formula_5 is the restriction of that of formula_6 and formula_5 is dense in formula_10 for the topology defined by the norm.

== Definition ==
In this article, denotes a field that is either the real numbers formula_11 or the complex numbers formula_12 A scalar is thus an element of . A bar over an expression representing a scalar denotes the complex conjugate of this scalar. A zero vector is denoted formula_13 for distinguishing it from the scalar .

An &quot;inner product&quot; space is a vector space over the field together with an &quot;inner product&quot;, that is, a map
:formula_14
that satisfies the following three properties for all vectors formula_15 and all scalars 

* &quot;Conjugate symmetry&quot;: formula_16 As formula_17 if and only if formula_18 is real, conjugate symmetry implies that formula_19 is always a real number. If is formula_20, conjugate symmetry is just symmetry.
* Linearity in the first argument: formula_21
* Positive-definiteness: if formula_22 is not zero, then formula_23 (conjugate symmetry implies that formula_24 is real).

If the positive-definiteness condition is replaced by merely requiring that formula_25 for all formula_22, then one obtains the definition of &quot;positive semi-definite Hermitian form&quot;. A positive semi-definite Hermitian form formula_27 is an inner product if and only if for all formula_22, if formula_29 then formula_30.

=== Basic properties ===
In the following properties, which result almost immediately from the definition of an inner product, and are arbitrary vectors, and and are arbitrary scalars. 
*formula_31
*formula_32 is real and nonnegative.
*formula_29 if and only if formula_34
*formula_35&lt;br&gt;This implies that an inner product is a sesquilinear form.
*formula_36 where formula_37&lt;br&gt;denotes the real part of its argument.

Over formula_20, conjugate-symmetry reduces to symmetry, and sesquilinearity reduces to bilinearity. Hence an inner product on a real vector space is a &quot;positive-definite symmetric bilinear form&quot;. The binomial expansion of a square becomes
: formula_39

=== Notation ===

Several notations are used for inner products, including 
formula_40, 
formula_41,
formula_42 and
formula_43, as well as the usual dot product.

=== Convention variant ===

Some authors, especially in physics and matrix algebra, prefer to define inner products and sesquilinear forms with linearity in the second argument rather than the first. Then the first argument becomes conjugate linear, rather than the second. Bra-ket notation in quantum mechanics also uses slightly different notation, i.e. formula_42, where formula_45.

==Examples==

===Real and complex numbers===

Among the simplest examples of inner product spaces are formula_20 and formula_12 
The real numbers formula_20 are a vector space over formula_20 that becomes an inner product space with arithmetic multiplication as its inner product:
formula_50

The complex numbers formula_51 are a vector space over formula_51 that becomes an inner product space with the inner product
formula_53 
Unlike with the real numbers, the assignment formula_54 does define a complex inner product on formula_12

===Euclidean vector space===

More generally, the real formula_56-space formula_57 with the dot product is an inner product space, an example of a Euclidean vector space.
formula_58
where formula_59 is the transpose of formula_60

A function formula_61 is an inner product on formula_57 if and only if there exists a symmetric positive-definite matrix formula_63 such that formula_64 for all formula_65 If formula_63 is the identity matrix then formula_64 is the dot product. For another example, if formula_68 and formula_69 is positive-definite (which happens if and only if formula_70 and one/both diagonal elements are positive) then for any formula_71
formula_72 
As mentioned earlier, every inner product on formula_73 is of this form (where formula_74 and formula_75 satisfy formula_76).

===Complex coordinate space===

The general form of an inner product on formula_77 is known as the Hermitian form and is given by
formula_78
where formula_79 is any Hermitian positive-definite matrix and formula_80 is the conjugate transpose of formula_81 For the real case, this corresponds to the dot product of the results of directionally-different scaling of the two vectors, with positive scale factors and orthogonal directions of scaling. It is a weighted-sum version of the dot product with positive weights‚Äîup to an orthogonal transformation.

===Hilbert space===

The article on Hilbert spaces has several examples of inner product spaces, wherein the metric induced by the inner product yields a complete metric space. An example of an inner product space which induces an incomplete metric is the space formula_82 of continuous complex valued functions formula_83 and formula_84 on the interval formula_85 The inner product is
formula_86
This space is not complete; consider for example, for the interval the sequence of continuous &quot;step&quot; functions, formula_87 defined by:
formula_88

This sequence is a Cauchy sequence for the norm induced by the preceding inner product, which does not converge to a function.

===Random variables===

For real random variables formula_89 and formula_90 the expected value of their product
formula_91
is an inner product. In this case, formula_92 if and only if formula_93 (that is, formula_94 almost surely), where formula_95 denotes the probability of the event. This definition of expectation as inner product can be extended to random vectors as well.

===Complex matrices===

The inner product for complex square matrices of the same size is the Frobenius inner product formula_96. Since trace and transposition are linear and the conjugation is on the second matrix, it is a sesquilinear operator. We further get Hermitian symmetry by, 
formula_97
Finally, since for formula_98 nonzero, formula_99, we get that the Frobenius inner product is positive definite too, and so is an inner product.

===Vector spaces with forms===

On an inner product space, or more generally a vector space with a nondegenerate form (hence an isomorphism formula_100), vectors can be sent to covectors (in coordinates, via transpose), so that one can take the inner product and outer product of two vectors‚Äînot simply of a vector and a covector.

==Basic results, terminology, and definitions==
===Norm properties ===

Every inner product space induces a norm, called its , that is defined by
formula_101 
With this norm, every inner product space becomes a normed vector space. 

So, every general property of normed vector spaces applies to inner product spaces. 
In particular, one has the following properties:



===Orthogonality===
{\|y\|^2}&lt;/math&gt; minimizes formula_83 with value formula_103 be a separable inner product space and formula_104 an orthonormal basis of formula_105 Then the map
formula_106
is an isometric linear map formula_107 with a dense image.

This theorem can be regarded as an abstract form of Fourier series, in which an arbitrary orthonormal basis plays the role of the sequence of trigonometric polynomials. Note that the underlying index set can be taken to be any countable set (and in fact any set whatsoever, provided formula_108 is defined appropriately, as is explained in the article Hilbert space). In particular, we obtain the following result in the theory of Fourier series:

Theorem. Let formula_109 be the inner product space formula_110 Then the sequence (indexed on set of all integers) of continuous functions
formula_111
is an orthonormal basis of the space formula_112 with the formula_113 inner product. The mapping
formula_114
is an isometric linear map with dense image.

Orthogonality of the sequence formula_115 follows immediately from the fact that if formula_116 then
formula_117

Normality of the sequence is by design, that is, the coefficients are so chosen so that the norm comes out to 1. Finally the fact that the sequence has a dense algebraic span, in the , follows from the fact that the sequence has a dense algebraic span, this time in the space of continuous periodic functions on formula_118 with the uniform norm. This is the content of the Weierstrass theorem on the uniform density of trigonometric polynomials.

==Operators on inner product spaces==

Several types of linear maps formula_119 between inner product spaces formula_109 and formula_121 are of relevance:
* : formula_119 is linear and continuous with respect to the metric defined above, or equivalently, formula_98 is linear and the set of non-negative reals formula_124 where formula_22 ranges over the closed unit ball of formula_126 is bounded.
* : formula_119 is linear and formula_128 for all formula_129
* : formula_119 satisfies formula_131 for all formula_132 A (resp. an ) is an isometry that is also a linear map (resp. an antilinear map). For inner product spaces, the polarization identity can be used to show that formula_98 is an isometry if and only if formula_134 for all formula_129 All isometries are injective. The Mazur‚ÄìUlam theorem establishes that every surjective isometry between two normed spaces is an affine transformation. Consequently, an isometry formula_98 between real inner product spaces is a linear map if and only if formula_137 Isometries are morphisms between inner product spaces, and morphisms of real inner product spaces are orthogonal transformations (compare with orthogonal matrix). 
* : formula_119 is an isometry which is surjective (and hence bijective). Isometrical isomorphisms are also known as unitary operators (compare with unitary matrix).

From the point of view of inner product space theory, there is no need to distinguish between two spaces which are isometrically isomorphic. The spectral theorem provides a canonical form for symmetric, unitary and more generally normal operators on finite dimensional inner product spaces. A generalization of the spectral theorem holds for continuous normal operators in Hilbert spaces.

==Generalizations==
Any of the axioms of an inner product may be weakened, yielding generalized notions. The generalizations that are closest to inner products occur where bilinearity and conjugate symmetry are retained, but positive-definiteness is weakened.

===Degenerate inner products===

If formula_109 is a vector space and formula_140 a semi-definite sesquilinear form, then the function:
formula_141
makes sense and satisfies all the properties of norm except that formula_142 does not imply formula_143 (such a functional is then called a semi-norm). We can produce an inner product space by considering the quotient formula_144 The sesquilinear form formula_140 factors through formula_146

This construction is used in numerous contexts. The Gelfand‚ÄìNaimark‚ÄìSegal construction is a particularly important example of the use of this technique. Another example is the representation of semi-definite kernels on arbitrary sets.

===Nondegenerate conjugate symmetric forms===

Alternatively, one may require that the pairing be a nondegenerate form, meaning that for all non-zero formula_147 there exists some formula_148 such that formula_149 though formula_148 need not equal formula_22; in other words, the induced map to the dual space formula_100 is injective. This generalization is important in differential geometry: a manifold whose tangent spaces have an inner product is a Riemannian manifold, while if this is related to nondegenerate conjugate symmetric form the manifold is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. By Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia, just as every inner product is similar to the dot product with positive weights on a set of vectors, every nondegenerate conjugate symmetric form is similar to the dot product with weights on a set of vectors, and the number of positive and negative weights are called respectively the positive index and negative index. Product of vectors in Minkowski space is an example of indefinite inner product, although, technically speaking, it is not an inner product according to the standard definition above. Minkowski space has four dimensions and indices 3 and 1 (assignment of &quot;+&quot; and &quot;‚àí&quot; to them differs depending on conventions).

Purely algebraic statements (ones that do not use positivity) usually only rely on the nondegeneracy (the injective homomorphism formula_100) and thus hold more generally.

==Related products==

The term &quot;inner product&quot; is opposed to outer product (tensor product), which is a slightly more general opposite. Simply, in coordinates, the inner product is the product of a formula_154 with an formula_155 vector, yielding a formula_156 matrix (a scalar), while the outer product is the product of an formula_157 vector with a formula_154 covector, yielding an formula_159 matrix. The outer product is defined for different dimensions, while the inner product requires the same dimension. If the dimensions are the same, then the inner product is the of the outer product (trace only being properly defined for square matrices). In an informal summary: &quot;inner is horizontal times vertical and shrinks down, outer is vertical times horizontal and expands out&quot;.

More abstractly, the outer product is the bilinear map formula_160 sending a vector and a covector to a rank 1 linear transformation (simple tensor of type (1, 1)), while the inner product is the bilinear evaluation map formula_161 given by evaluating a covector on a vector; the order of the domain vector spaces here reflects the covector/vector distinction.

The inner product and outer product should not be confused with the interior product and exterior product, which are instead operations on vector fields and differential forms, or more generally on the exterior algebra.

As a further complication, in geometric algebra the inner product and the (Grassmann) product are combined in the geometric product (the Clifford product in a Clifford algebra) ‚Äì the inner product sends two vectors (1-vectors) to a scalar (a 0-vector), while the exterior product sends two vectors to a bivector (2-vector) ‚Äì and in this context the exterior product is usually called the (alternatively, ). The inner product is more correctly called a product in this context, as the nondegenerate quadratic form in question need not be positive definite (need not be an inner product).

Banks, adding the initial of his adopted middle name Menzies (). After the success of &quot;The Wasp Factory&quot; (1984), he began to write full time. His first science fiction book, &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, appeared in 1987, marking the start of the &quot;Culture&quot; series. His books have been adapted for theatre, radio, and television. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; named Banks in their list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;.

In April 2013, Banks announced he had inoperable cancer and was unlikely to live beyond a year. He died on 9 June 2013.

==Early life==
Banks was born in Dunfermline, Fife, to a mother who was a professional ice skater and a father who was an officer in the Admiralty. An only child, he lived in North Queensferry until the age of nine, near the naval dockyards in Rosyth, where his father was based. The family then moved to Gourock due to his father&#x27;s work. When someone introduced him to science fiction by giving him &quot;Kemlo and the Zones of Silence&quot; by Reginald Alec Martin, he continued reading the series, which encouraged him to write science fiction himself. After attending Gourock and Greenock High Schools, Banks studied English, philosophy, and psychology at the University of Stirling (1972‚Äì1975).

After graduation, Banks took a succession of jobs that left him free to write in the evenings. These supported his writing throughout his twenties and allowed him to take long breaks between contracts, during which time he travelled through Europe and North America. During this period, he worked as an IBM &#x27;Expediter Analyser&#x27; (a kind of procurement clerk), a testing technician for the British Steel Corporation, and a costing clerk for a law firm in London&#x27;s Chancery Lane.

==Career==
===Writing career===
Banks took up writing at the age of 11. He completed a first novel, &quot;The Hungarian Lift-Jet&quot;, at 16 and a second, &quot;TTR&quot; (also entitled &quot;The Tashkent Rambler&quot;) in his first year at Stirling University in 1972. Though he saw himself mainly as a science fiction author, his publishing problems led him to pursue mainstream fiction. His first published novel &quot;The Wasp Factory&quot;, appeared in 1984, when he was thirty. After the success of &quot;The Wasp Factory&quot;, Banks began to write full time. His editor at Macmillan, James Hale, advised him to write a book a year, which he agreed to do.

His second novel &quot;Walking on Glass&quot; followed in 1985, then &quot;The Bridge&quot; in 1986, and in 1987 &quot;Espedair Street&quot;, which was later broadcast as a series on BBC Radio 4. His first published science fiction book, &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;, emerged in 1987 and was the first of several in the acclaimed Culture series. Banks cited Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Brian Aldiss, M. John Harrison and Dan Simmons as influences. &quot;The Crow Road&quot;, published in 1992, was adapted as a BBC television series. Banks continued to write both science fiction and mainstream. His final novel &quot;The Quarry&quot; appeared in June 2013, the month of his death.

Banks published work under two names. His parents had meant to name him &quot;Iain Menzies Banks&quot;, but his father mistakenly registered him as &quot;Iain Banks&quot;. Banks still used the middle name and submitted &quot;The Wasp Factory&quot; for publication as &quot;Iain M. Banks&quot;. Banks&#x27;s editor inquired about the possibility of omitting the &#x27;M&#x27; as it appeared &quot;too fussy&quot; and the potential existed for confusion with Rosie M. Banks, a romantic novelist in the Jeeves novels by P. G. Wodehouse; Banks agreed to the omission. After three mainstream novels, Banks&#x27;s publishers agreed to publish his first science fiction (SF) novel &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;. To create a distinction between the mainstream and the SF, Banks suggested returning the &#x27;M&#x27; to his name, which was then used in all of his science fiction works.
By his death in June 2013, Banks had published 26 novels. A 27th novel &quot;The Quarry&quot; was published posthumously. His final work, a poetry collection, appeared in February 2015. In an interview in January 2013, he also mentioned he had the plot idea for another novel in the Culture series, which would most likely have been his next book and was planned for publication in 2014. A project to publish Banks&#x27;s unseen early drawings, maps and sketches from the Culture universe alongs with his writings and notes on the setting was underway in February 2018. In 2021, the delayed single volume of &quot;The Culture: Notes and Drawings&quot; was cancelled and replaced with two separate volumes: a landscape artbook of &quot;The Culture: The Drawings&quot; and a companion volume containing notes, excerpts and new text from Ken MacLeod. &quot;The Culture: The Drawings&quot; was released on 7 November 2023, while the still-untitled companion volume was scheduled for late 2024. 

Banks wrote in various categories, but enjoyed science fiction most.

In September 2012 Banks became a Guest of Honour at the 2014 World Science Fiction Convention, Loncon 3.

===Radio and television===
Banks was the subject of &quot;The Strange Worlds of Iain Banks&quot; &quot;South Bank Show&quot; (1997), a TV documentary that examined his mainstream writing, and was an in-studio guest for the final episode of Marc Riley&#x27;s &quot;Rocket Science&quot; radio show, broadcast on BBC Radio 6 Music. An audio version of &quot;The Business&quot;, set to contemporary music, arranged by Paul Oakenfold, was broadcast in October 1999 on Galaxy Fm as the tenth Urban Soundtracks.
Banks&#x27;s &quot;The State of the Art,&quot; adapted for radio by Paul Cornell, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2009 with Nadia Molinari producing and directing. In 1998 &quot;Espedair Street&quot; was dramatised as a serial for Radio 4, presented by Paul Gambaccini in the style of a Radio 1 documentary.

In 2011 Banks featured on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Saturday Live&quot;. Banks reaffirmed his atheism in this appearance, explaining death as an important &quot;part of the totality of life&quot; that should be treated realistically instead of feared.

Banks appeared on the BBC television programme &quot;Question Time&quot;, a show that features political discussion. In 2006 he captained a team of writers to victory in a special series of BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;University Challenge&quot;. Banks also won a 2006 edition of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;; the author selected &quot;Malt whisky and the distilleries of Scotland&quot; as his specialist subject.

His final interview was with Kirsty Wark, broadcast on BBC2 Scotland as &quot;Iain Banks: Raw Spirit&quot; 12 June 2013.

BBC One Scotland and BBC2 broadcast an adaptation of his novel &quot;Stonemouth&quot; in June 2015.

===Theatre===
Banks was involved in the stage production &quot;The Curse of Iain Banks&quot;, written by Maxton Walker and performed at the Edinburgh Fringe festival in 1999. Banks collaborated frequently with its soundtrack composer Gary Lloyd, for instance on a song collection they co-composed as a tribute to the fictional band &quot;Frozen Gold&quot; from Banks&#x27;s novel &quot;Espedair Street&quot;. Lloyd also scored for a spoken word and music production of his novel &quot;The Bridge&quot;, which Banks himself voiced and which featured a cast of 40 musicians, released on CD by Codex Records in 1996. Lloyd recorded Banks for including in the play as a disembodied voice of himself in one of the cast member&#x27;s dreams. Lloyd explained his collaboration with Banks on their first versions of &quot;Espedair Street&quot; (later versions being dated between 2005 and 2013) in a &quot;Guardian&quot; article prior to the opening of &quot;The Curse of Iain Banks&quot;:

When he [Banks] first played them to me, I think he was worried that they might not be up to scratch (some of them dated back to 1973 and had never been heard). He needn&#x27;t have worried. They&#x27;re fantastic. We&#x27;re slaving away to get the songs to the stage where we can go into the studio and make a demo. Iain bashes out melodies on his state-of-the-art Apple Mac in Edinburgh and sends them down to me in Chester where I put them onto my Atari.
==Politics==
Banks&#x27;s political stance has been termed &quot;left of centre&quot; and in 2002 he endorsed the Scottish Socialist Party.

He was an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Distinguished Supporter of the Humanist Society Scotland. As a signatory to the Declaration of Calton Hill, he supported Scottish independence. In November 2012, Banks backed the campaign group emerging from the Radical Independence Conference held in that month. He opined that the independence movement was marked by cooperation: &quot;Scots just seem to be more communitarian than the consensus expressed by the UK population as a whole.&quot;

In late 2004, Banks joined a group of UK politicians and media figures campaigning to have Prime Minister Tony Blair impeached after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In protest, he cut up his passport and posted it to 10 Downing Street. In a &quot;Socialist Review&quot; interview, Banks explained that his passport protest occurred after he had &quot;abandoned the idea of crashing my Land Rover through the gates of Fife dockyard, after spotting the guys armed with machine guns.&quot; Banks relayed his concerns about the Iraq invasion in his book &quot;Raw Spirit&quot; and through the protagonist Alban McGill in the novel &quot;The Steep Approach to Garbadale&quot;, who confronts another character with arguments of a similar kind.

In 2010, Banks called for a cultural and educational boycott of Israel after the Gaza flotilla raid incident. In a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, Banks said he had instructed his agent to turn down any further book translation deals with Israeli publishers:

Appeals to reason, international law, U. N. resolutions and simple human decency mean ‚Äì it is now obvious ‚Äì nothing to Israel... I would urge all writers, artists and others in the creative arts, as well as those academics engaging in joint educational projects with Israeli institutions, to consider doing everything they can to convince Israel of its moral degradation and ethical isolation, preferably by simply having nothing more to do with this outlaw state.
An extract from Banks&#x27;s contribution to the written collection &quot;Generation Palestine: Voices from the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement&quot;, entitled &quot;Our People&quot;, appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in the wake of the author&#x27;s cancer revelation. The extract conveys the author&#x27;s support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign issued by a Palestinian civil society against Israel until the country complies with what it holds are international law and Palestinian rights. This commenced in 2005 and applies lessons from Banks&#x27;s experience with South Africa&#x27;s apartheid era. The continuation of Banks&#x27;s boycott of Israeli publishers for the sale of rights to his novels was confirmed in the extract and Banks further explained, &quot;I don&#x27;t buy Israeli-sourced products or food, and my partner and I try to support Palestinian-sourced products wherever possible.&quot;

==Personal life==
Banks met his first wife Annie in London before the 1984 release of his first book. They lived in Faversham in the south of England, then split up in 1988. Banks returned to Edinburgh and dated another woman for two years. Iain and Annie were reconciled a year later and they moved to Fife. They were married in Hawaii in 1992, but in 2005, after 15 years of marriage, they separated.

In 1998 Banks was in a near-fatal accident when his car rolled off the road. In February 2007, Banks sold his extensive car collection, including a 3.2-litre Porsche Boxster, a Porsche 911 Turbo, a 3.8-litre Jaguar Mark II, a 5-litre BMW M5 and a daily-use diesel Land Rover Defender, whose power he had boosted by about 50 per cent. All these Banks exchanged for a Lexus RX 400h hybrid ‚Äì later replaced by a diesel Toyota Yaris, and said in future he would fly only in emergencies.

In April 2012 Banks became the &quot;Acting Honorary Non-Executive Figurehead President Elect pro tem (trainee)&quot; of the Science Fiction Book Club based in London. The title was his creation and on 3 October 2012 Banks accepted a T-shirt inscribed with it.

From 2006 Banks lived in North Queensferry on the north side of the Firth of Forth, with his girlfriend Adele Hartley, an author and founder of the Dead by Dawn film festival. She and Banks met in 1990, and married on 29 March 2013 after he asked her to &quot;do me the honour of becoming my widow.&quot;

===Illness and death===
On 3 April 2013, Banks announced on his website and on one set up by him and some friends that he had been diagnosed with terminal gallbladder cancer and was unlikely to live beyond a year. He stated he would be withdrawing from all public engagements and that &quot;The Quarry&quot; would be his last novel. The dates of publication of &quot;The Quarry&quot; were brought forward at Banks&#x27;s request, to 20 June 2013 in the UK and 25 June 2013 in the US and Canada. He died on 9 June 2013.

===Remembrance and tribute===
Banks&#x27;s publisher called him &quot;an irreplaceable part of the literary world&quot;. This was reaffirmed by a fellow Scottish author and friend since secondary school Ken MacLeod: his death &quot;left a large gap in the Scottish literary scene as well as the wider English-speaking world.&quot; British author Charles Stross wrote, &quot;One of the giants of 20th and 21st century Scottish literature has left the building.&quot; Authors, including Neil Gaiman, Ian Rankin, Alastair Reynolds and David Brin also paid tribute in blogs and elsewhere.

The asteroid 5099 Iainbanks was named after him shortly after his death. On 23 January 2015, SpaceX&#x27;s CEO Elon Musk named two of the firm&#x27;s autonomous spaceport drone ships &quot;Just Read The Instructions&quot; and &quot;Of Course I Still Love You&quot;, after ships in Banks&#x27;s novel &quot;The Player of Games&quot;. Another, &quot;A Shortfall of Gravitas&quot;, began construction in 2018. This refers to the ship &quot;Experiencing A Significant Gravitas Shortfall&quot;, first mentioned in &quot;Look to Windward&quot;.

&quot;The Red Virgin and the Vision of Utopia&quot;, the 2016 graphic biography of Louise Michel by Mary M. Talbot and Bryan Talbot, is &quot;Dedicated to the memory of Iain (M) Banks, friend and sorely missed creator of socialist utopias.&quot;

&quot;Empire Games&quot;, the seventh book in &quot;The Merchant Princes&quot; series by Charles Stross published in 2017, is dedicated &quot;For Iain M. Banks, who painted a picture of a better way.&quot;

On 13 May 2019, the Five Deeps Expedition broke the deepest ocean dive record in the &quot;DSV Limiting Factor&quot;. The support ship was named &quot;DSSV Pressure Drop&quot;. Both vessels were named after ships in the Culture series, which is much admired by the explorer Victor Vescovo, also the financial sponsor behind &quot;Limiting Factor&quot;‚Ä≥s design and construction. They also have landers named &quot;Flere,&quot; &quot;Skaff,&quot; and &quot;Closp,&quot; named after Culture drones.

===Science fiction===
Banks wrote thirteen SF novels, nine of which were part of the Culture series, and a short story collection called &quot;The State of the Art&quot; (1991), which includes some stories set in the same universe. These works focus upon characters that are usually on the margins of the Culture, a post-scarcity anarchist utopia. In the same universe are other civilizations, which the Culture sometimes attempts to influence or &quot;contact&quot;, occasionally resulting in conflict. The culture has achieved utopia by handing control of all of their worlds and ships over to sentient artificial intelligences referred to as &quot;Minds&quot;.

<text>An incunable or incunabulum (: incunables or incunabula, respectively) is a book, pamphlet, or broadside that was printed in the earliest stages of printing in Europe, up to the year 1500. The specific date is essentially arbitrary, but the number of printed book editions exploded in the following century, so that all incunabula, produced before the printing press became widespread in Europe, are rare, where even some early 16th-century books are relatively common. 

They are distinct from manuscripts, which are documents written by hand. Some authorities on the history of printing include block books from the same time period as incunabula, whereas others limit the term to works printed using movable type.

 there are about 30,000 distinct incunable editions known. The probable number of surviving individual copies is much higher, estimated at 125,000 in Germany alone. Through statistical analysis, it is estimated that the number of lost editions is at least 20,000. Around 550,000 copies of around 27,500 different works have been preserved worldwide.

==Terminology==
Incunable is the anglicised form of &quot;incunabulum&quot;, reconstructed singular of Latin , which meant &quot;swaddling clothes&quot;, or &quot;cradle&quot;, which could metaphorically refer to &quot;the earliest stages or first traces in the development&quot;. A former term for incunable is fifteener, meaning &quot;fifteenth-century edition&quot;.

The term &quot;incunabula&quot; was first used in the context of printing by the Dutch physician and humanist Hadrianus Junius (Adriaen de Jonghe, 1511‚Äì1575), in a passage in his work &quot;Batavia&quot; (written in 1569; published posthumously in 1588). He referred to a period &quot;&quot; (&quot;in the first infancy of the typographic art&quot;). The term has sometimes been incorrectly attributed to Bernhard von Mallinckrodt (1591‚Äì1664), in his Latin pamphlet (&quot;On the rise and progress of the typographic art&quot;; 1640), but he was quoting Junius.

The term &quot;incunabula&quot; came to denote printed books themselves in the late 17th century. It is not found in English before the mid-19th century.

Junius set an end-date of 1500 to his era of &quot;incunabula&quot;, which remains the convention in modern bibliographical scholarship. This convenient but arbitrary end-date for identifying a printed book as an incunable does not reflect changes in the printing process, and many books printed for some years after 1500 are visually indistinguishable from incunables. The term &quot;post-incunable&quot; is now used to refer to books printed after 1500 up to 1520 or 1540, without general agreement. From around this period the dating of any edition becomes easier, as the practice of printing the place and year of publication using a colophon or on the title page became more widespread.

==Types==
There are two types of printed incunabula: the block book, printed from a single carved or sculpted wooden block for each page (the same process as the woodcut in art, called &quot;xylographic&quot;); and the &quot;typographic book&quot;, made by individual cast-metal movable type pieces on a printing press. Many authors reserve the term &quot;incunabula&quot; for the latter.

The spread of printing to cities both in the North and in Italy ensured that there was great variety in the texts and the styles which appeared. Many early typefaces were modelled on local writing or derived from various European Gothic scripts, but there were also some derived from documentary scripts like Caxton&#x27;s, and, particularly in Italy, types modelled on handwritten scripts and calligraphy used by humanists.

Printers congregated in urban centres where there were scholars, ecclesiastics, lawyers, and nobles and professionals who formed their major customer base. Standard works in Latin inherited from the medieval tradition formed the bulk of the earliest printed works, but as books became cheaper, vernacular works (or translations into vernaculars of standard works) began to appear.

==Famous examples==
Famous incunabula include two from Mainz, the Gutenberg Bible of 1455 and the &quot;Peregrinatio in terram sanctam&quot; of 1486, printed and illustrated by Erhard Reuwich; the &quot;Nuremberg Chronicle&quot; written by Hartmann Schedel and printed by Anton Koberger in 1493; and the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot; printed by Aldus Manutius with important illustrations by an unknown artist.

Other printers of incunabula were G√ºnther Zainer of Augsburg, Johannes Mentelin and Heinrich Eggestein of Strasbourg, Heinrich Gran of Haguenau, Johann Amerbach of Basel, William Caxton of Bruges and London, and Nicolas Jenson of Venice. The first incunable to have woodcut illustrations was Ulrich Boner&#x27;s &quot;Der Edelstein&quot;, printed by Albrecht Pfister in Bamberg in 1461.

A finding in 2015 brought evidence of quires, as claimed by research, possibly printed in 1444‚Äì1446 and possibly assigned to Procopius Waldvogel of Avignon, France.

==Post-incunable==
Many incunabula are undated, needing complex bibliographical analysis to place them correctly. The post-incunabula period marks a time of development during which the printed book evolved fully as a mature artefact with a standard format. After about 1540 books tended to conform to a pattern that included the author, title-page, date, seller, and place of printing. This makes it much easier to identify any particular edition.

As noted above, the &quot;end date&quot; for identifying a printed book as an incunable is convenient but was chosen arbitrarily; it does not reflect any notable developments in the printing process around the year 1500. Books printed for a number of years after 1500 continued to look much like incunables, with the notable exception of the small format books printed in italic type introduced by Aldus Manutius in 1501. The term post-incunable is sometimes used to refer to books printed &quot;after 1500‚Äîhow long after, the experts have not yet agreed.&quot; For books printed in England, the term generally covers 1501‚Äì1520, and for books printed in mainland Europe, 1501‚Äì1540.

==Statistical data==


The data in this section were derived from the Incunabula Short-Title Catalogue (ISTC).

The number of printing towns and cities stands at 282. These are situated in some 18 countries in terms of present-day boundaries. In descending order of the number of editions printed in each, these are: Italy, Germany, France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, England, Austria, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Turkey, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Hungary (see diagram).

The following table shows the 20 main 15th-century printing locations; as with all data in this section, exact figures are given, but should be treated as close estimates (the total editions recorded in ISTC at August 2016 is 30,518):

The 18 languages that incunabula are printed in, in descending order, are: Latin, German, Italian, French, Dutch, Spanish, English, Hebrew, Catalan, Czech, Greek, Church Slavonic, Portuguese, Swedish, Breton, Danish, Frisian and Sardinian (see diagram).

Only about one edition in ten (i.e. just over 3,000) has any illustrations, woodcuts or metalcuts.

The &quot;commonest&quot; incunable is Schedel&#x27;s &quot;Nuremberg Chronicle&quot; (&quot;Liber Chronicarum&quot;) of 1493, with about 1,250 surviving copies (which is also the most heavily illustrated). Many incunabula are unique, but on average about 18 copies survive of each. This makes the Gutenberg Bible, at 48 or 49 known copies, a relatively common (though extremely valuable) edition. Counting extant incunabula is complicated by the fact that most libraries consider a single volume of a multi-volume work as a separate item, as well as fragments or copies lacking more than half the total leaves. A complete incunable may consist of a slip, or up to ten volumes.

In terms of format, the 30,000-odd editions comprise: 2,000 broadsides, 9,000 folios, 15,000 quartos, 3,000 octavos, 18 12mos, 230 16mos, 20 32mos, and 3 64mos.

ISTC at present cites 528 extant copies of books printed by Caxton, which together with 128 fragments makes 656 in total, though many are broadsides or very imperfect (incomplete).

Apart from migration to mainly North American and Japanese universities, there has been little movement of incunabula in the last five centuries. None were printed in the Southern Hemisphere, and the latter appears to possess less than 2,000 copies, about 97.75% remain north of the equator. However, many incunabula are sold at auction or through the rare book trade every year.

==Major collections==
The British Library&#x27;s Incunabula Short Title Catalogue now records over 29,000 titles, of which around 27,400 are incunabula editions (not all unique works). Studies of incunabula began in the 17th century. Michel Maittaire (1667‚Äì1747) and Georg Wolfgang Panzer (1729‚Äì1805) arranged printed material chronologically in annals format, and in the first half of the 19th century, Ludwig Hain published the &quot;Repertorium bibliographicum&quot;‚Äîa checklist of incunabula arranged alphabetically by author: &quot;Hain numbers&quot; are still a reference point. Hain was expanded in subsequent editions, by Walter A. Copinger and Dietrich Reichling, but it is being superseded by the authoritative modern listing, a German catalogue, the &quot;Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke&quot;, which has been under way since 1925 and is still being compiled at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin. North American holdings were listed by Frederick R. Goff and a worldwide union catalogue is provided by the Incunabula Short Title Catalogue.

<doc id="14865" wikidata="Q273163" url="?curid=14865" title="Isotropy">
<text>In physics and geometry, isotropy () is uniformity in all orientations. Precise definitions depend on the subject area. Exceptions, or inequalities, are frequently indicated by the prefix &#x27; or&#x27;, hence &quot;anisotropy&quot;. &quot;Anisotropy&quot; is also used to describe situations where properties vary systematically, dependent on direction. Isotropic radiation has the same intensity regardless of the direction of measurement, and an isotropic field exerts the same action regardless of how the test particle is oriented.

==Mathematics==
Within mathematics, &quot;isotropy&quot; has a few different meanings:
; Isotropic manifolds: A manifold is isotropic if the geometry on the manifold is the same regardless of direction. A similar concept is homogeneity. 
; Isotropic quadratic form: A quadratic form &quot;q&quot; is said to be isotropic if there is a non-zero vector &quot;v&quot; such that ; such a &quot;v&quot; is an isotropic vector or null vector. In complex geometry, a line through the origin in the direction of an isotropic vector is an isotropic line.
; Isotropic coordinates: Isotropic coordinates are coordinates on an isotropic chart for Lorentzian manifolds.
; Isotropy group:An isotropy group is the group of isomorphisms from any object to itself in a groupoid. An isotropy representation is a representation of an isotropy group.
; Isotropic position: A probability distribution over a vector space is in isotropic position if its covariance matrix is the identity. 
; Isotropic vector field: The vector field generated by a point source is said to be &quot;isotropic&quot; if, for any spherical neighborhood centered at the point source, the magnitude of the vector determined by any point on the sphere is invariant under a change in direction. For an example, starlight appears to be isotropic.

==Physics==
; Quantum mechanics or particle physics: When a spinless particle (or even an unpolarized particle with spin) decays, the resulting decay distribution &quot;must&quot; be isotropic in the rest frame of the decaying particle - regardless of the detailed physics of the decay. This follows from rotational invariance of the Hamiltonian, which in turn is guaranteed for a spherically symmetric potential.

; Gases: The kinetic theory of gases also exemplifies isotropy. It is assumed that the molecules move in random directions and as a consequence, there is an equal probability of a molecule moving in any direction. Thus when there are many molecules in the gas, with high probability there will be very similar numbers moving in one direction as any other, demonstrating approximate isotropy.

; Fluid dynamics: Fluid flow is isotropic if there is no directional preference (e.g. in fully developed 3D turbulence). An example of anisotropy is in flows with a background density as gravity works in only one direction. The apparent surface separating two differing isotropic fluids would be referred to as an isotrope.

; Thermal expansion: A solid is said to be isotropic if the expansion of solid is equal in all directions when thermal energy is provided to the solid.

; Electromagnetics: An isotropic medium is one such that the permittivity, Œµ, and permeability, Œº, of the medium are uniform in all directions of the medium, the simplest instance being free space.

; Optics: Optical isotropy means having the same optical properties in all directions. The individual reflectance or transmittance of the domains is averaged for micro-heterogeneous samples if the macroscopic reflectance or transmittance is to be calculated. This can be verified simply by investigating, for example, a polycrystalline material under a polarizing microscope having the polarizers crossed: If the crystallites are larger than the resolution limit, they will be visible. 
; Cosmology: The cosmological principle, which underpins much of modern cosmology (including the Big Bang theory of the evolution of the observable universe), assumes that the universe is both isotropic and homogeneous, meaning that the universe has no preferred location (is the same everywhere) and has no preferred direction. Observations made in 2006 suggest that, on distance-scales much larger than galaxies, galaxy clusters are &quot;Great&quot; features, but small compared to so-called multiverse scenarios.

===Materials science===

In the study of mechanical properties of materials, &quot;isotropic&quot; means having identical values of a property in all directions. This definition is also used in geology and mineralogy. Glass and metals are examples of isotropic materials. Common anisotropic materials include wood (because its material properties are different parallel to and perpendicular to the grain) and layered rocks such as slate.

Isotropic materials are useful since they are easier to shape, and their behavior is easier to predict. Anisotropic materials can be tailored to the forces an object is expected to experience. For example, the fibers in carbon fiber materials and rebars in reinforced concrete are oriented to withstand tension.

===Microfabrication===
In industrial processes, such as etching steps, &quot;isotropic&quot; means that the process proceeds at the same rate, regardless of direction. Simple chemical reaction and removal of a substrate by an acid, a solvent or a reactive gas is often very close to isotropic. Conversely, &quot;anisotropic&quot; means that the attack rate of the substrate is higher in a certain direction. Anisotropic etch processes, where vertical etch-rate is high but lateral etch-rate is very small, are essential processes in microfabrication of integrated circuits and MEMS devices.

===Antenna (radio)===
An isotropic antenna is an idealized &quot;radiating element&quot; used as a reference; an antenna that broadcasts power equally (calculated by the Poynting vector) in all directions. The gain of an arbitrary antenna is usually reported in decibels relative to an isotropic antenna, and is expressed as dBi or dB(i).

In cells (a.k.a. muscle fibers), the term &quot;isotropic&quot; refers to the light bands (I bands) that contribute to the striated pattern of the cells.

=== Pharmacology ===
While it is well established that the skin provides an ideal site for the administration of local and systemic drugs, it presents a formidable barrier to the permeation of most substances. Recently, isotropic formulations have been used extensively in dermatology for drug delivery.

==Computer science==

; Imaging:A volume such as a computed tomography is said to have isotropic voxel spacing when the space between any two adjacent voxels is the same along each axis &quot;x, y, z&quot;. E.g., voxel spacing is isotropic if the center of voxel &quot;(i, j, k)&quot; is 1.38¬†mm from that of &quot;(i+1, j, k)&quot;, 1.38¬†mm from that of &quot;(i, j+1, k)&quot; and 1.38¬†mm from that of &quot;(i, j, k+1)&quot; for all indices &quot;i, j, k&quot;.

==Other sciences==
; Economics and geography: An isotropic region is a region that has the same properties everywhere. Such a region is a construction needed in many types of models.

<doc id="14868" wikidata="Q828490" url="?curid=14868" title="International Mathematical Union">
<text>The International Mathematical Union (IMU) is an international organization devoted to international cooperation in the field of mathematics across the world. It is a member of the International Science Council (ISC) and supports the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM). Its members are national mathematics organizations from more than 80 countries.

The objectives of the International Mathematical Union are: promoting international cooperation in mathematics, supporting and assisting the International Congress of Mathematicians and other international scientific meetings/conferences, acknowledging outstanding research contributions to mathematics through the awarding of scientific prizes, and encouraging and supporting other international mathematical activities, considered likely to contribute to the development of mathematical science in any of its aspects, whether pure, applied, or educational.
==History==
The IMU was established in 1920, but dissolved in September 1932 and reestablished in 1950 at the Constitutive Convention in New York, de jure on September 10, 1951, when ten countries had become members. The last milestone was the General Assembly in March 1952, in Rome, Italy where the activities of the new IMU were inaugurated and the first Executive Committee, President and various commissions were elected. In 1952 the IMU was also readmitted to the ICSU. The past president of the Union is Carlos Kenig (2019‚Äì2022). The current president is Hiraku Nakajima.

At the 16th meeting of the IMU General Assembly in Bangalore, India, in August 2010, Berlin was chosen as the location of the permanent office of the IMU, which was opened on January 1, 2011, and is hosted by the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS), an institute of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community, with about 120 scientists engaging in mathematical research applied to complex problems in industry and commerce.

==Commissions and committees==
IMU has a close relationship to mathematics education through its International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI). This commission is organized similarly to IMU with its own Executive Committee and General Assembly.

Developing countries are a high priority for the IMU and a significant percentage of its budget, including grants received from individuals, mathematical societies, foundations, and funding agencies, is spent on activities for developing countries. Since 2011 this has been coordinated by the Commission for Developing Countries (CDC).

The Committee for Women in Mathematics (CWM) is concerned with issues related to women in mathematics worldwide. It organizes the World Meeting for Women in Mathematics formula_1 as a satellite event of ICM.

The International Commission on the History of Mathematics (ICHM) is operated jointly by the IMU and the Division of the History of Science (DHS) of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science (IUHPS).

The Committee on Electronic Information and Communication (CEIC) advises IMU on matters concerning mathematical information, communication, and publishing.

==Prizes==
The scientific prizes awarded by the IMU, in the quadrennial International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), are deemed to be some of the highest distinctions in the mathematical world. These are:
* the Fields Medals (two to four awarded per Congress, since 1936);
* the IMU Abacus Medal (previously known as the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize; awarded since 1986);
* the Carl Friedrich Gauss Prize (since 2006); 
* the Chern Medal (since 2010); and
* the Leelavati Award (since 2010).

==Membership and General Assembly==
The IMU&#x27;s members are Member Countries and each Member country is represented through an Adhering Organization, which may be its principal academy, a mathematical society, its research council or some other institution or association of institutions, or an appropriate agency of its government. A country starting to develop its mathematical culture and interested in building links with mathematicians all over the world is invited to join IMU as an Associate Member. For the purpose of facilitating jointly sponsored activities and jointly pursuing the objectives of the IMU, multinational mathematical societies and professional societies can join IMU as an Affiliate Member. Every four years, the IMU membership gathers in a General Assembly (GA), which consists of delegates appointed by the Adhering Organizations, together with the members of the executive committee. All important decisions are made at the GA, including the election of the officers, establishment of commissions, the approval of the budget, and any changes to the statutes and by-laws.

===Members and Associate Members===
The IMU has 83 (full) Member countries and two Associate Members (Bangladesh and Paraguay, marked below by light grey background).



===Affiliate members===
The IMU has five affiliate members:

* African Mathematical Union (AMU)
* European Mathematical Society (EMS)
* Mathematical Council of the Americas (MCofA)
* Southeast Asian Mathematical Society (SEAMS)
* Uni√≥n Matem√°tica de Am√©rica Latina y el Caribe (UMALCA)

==Organization and Executive Committee==
The International Mathematical Union is administered by an executive committee (EC) which conducts the business of the Union. The EC consists of the President, two vice-presidents, the Secretary, six Members-at-Large, all elected for a term of four years, and the Past President. The EC is responsible for all policy matters and for tasks, such as choosing the members of the ICM Program Committee and various prize committees.

==Publications==
Every two months IMU publishes an electronic newsletter, &quot;IMU-Net&quot;, that aims to improve communication between IMU and the worldwide mathematical community by reporting on decisions and recommendations of the Union, major international mathematical events and developments, and on other topics of general mathematical interest. IMU Bulletins are published annually with the aim to inform IMU&#x27;s members about the Union&#x27;s current activities. In 2009 IMU published the document &quot;Best Current Practices for Journals&quot;.

==IMU‚Äôs Involvement in developing countries==
The IMU took its first organized steps towards the promotion of mathematics in developing countries in the early 1970s and has, since then supported various activities. In 2010 IMU formed the Commission for Developing Countries (CDC) which brings together all of the past and current initiatives in support of mathematics and mathematicians in the developing world.

Some IMU Supported Initiatives:
*&quot;Grants Program for Mathematicians:&quot; The Commission for Developing Countries supports research travel of mathematicians based in developing countries as well as mathematics research conferences in the developing world through its Grants Program which is open to mathematicians throughout the developing world, including countries that are not (yet) members of the IMU.
*&quot;African Mathematics Millennium Science Initiative&quot; (AMMSI) is a network of mathematics centers in sub-Saharan Africa that organizes conferences and workshops, visiting lectureships and an extensive scholarship program for mathematics graduate students doing PhD work on the African continent.
*&quot;Mentoring African Research in Mathematics (MARM):&quot; IMU supported the London Mathematical Society (LMS) in founding the MARM programme, which supports mathematics and its teaching in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa via a mentoring partnership between mathematicians in the United Kingdom and African colleagues, together with their students. It focuses on cultivating long-term mentoring relations between individual mathematicians and students.
*&quot;Volunteer Lecturer Program&quot; (VLP) of IMU identifies mathematicians interested in contributing to the formation of young mathematicians in the developing world. The Volunteer Lecturer Program maintains a database of mathematic volunteers willing to offer month-long intensive courses at the advanced undergraduate or graduate level in degree programmes at universities in the developing world. IMU also seeks applications from universities and mathematics degree programmes in the developing world that are in need of volunteer lecturers, and that can provide the necessary conditions for productive collaboration in the teaching of advanced mathematics.

IMU also supports the &quot;International Commission on Mathematical Instruction&quot; (ICMI) with its programmes, exhibits and workshops in emerging countries, especially in Asia and Africa.

IMU released a report in 2008, &quot;Mathematics in Africa: Challenges and Opportunities&quot;, on the current state of mathematics in Africa and on opportunities for new initiatives to support mathematical development. In 2014, the IMU&#x27;s Commission for Developing Countries CDC released an update of the report.

Additionally, reports about &quot;Mathematics in Latin America and the Caribbean and South East Asia&quot;. were published.

In July 2014 IMU released the report: The International Mathematical Union in the Developing World: Past, Present and Future (July 2014).
== MENAO Symposium at the ICM ==

In 2014, the IMU held a day-long symposium prior to the opening of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), entitled &quot;Mathematics in Emerging Nations: Achievements and Opportunities&quot; (MENAO). Approximately 260 participants from around the world, including representatives of embassies, scientific institutions, private business and foundations attended this session. Attendees heard inspiring stories of individual mathematicians and specific developing nations.

<text>The International Council for Science (ICSU, after its former name, International Council of Scientific Unions) was an international non-governmental organization devoted to international cooperation in the advancement of science. Its members were national scientific bodies and international scientific unions.

In 2017, the ICSU comprised 122 multi-disciplinary National Scientific Members, Associates and Observers representing 142 countries and 31 international, disciplinary Scientific Unions. ICSU also had 22 Scientific Associates. In July 2018, ICSU merged with the International Social Science Council (ISSC) to form the International Science Council (ISC) at a constituent general assembly in Paris.

==Mission and principles==
The ICSU&#x27;s mission was to strengthen international science for the benefit of society. To do this, the ICSU mobilized the knowledge and resources of the international scientific community to:

* Identify and address major issues of importance to science and society.
* Facilitate interaction amongst scientists across all disciplines and from all countries.
* Promote the participation of all scientists ‚Äì regardless of race, citizenship, language, political stance, or gender ‚Äì in the international scientific endeavour.
* Provide independent, authoritative advice to stimulate constructive dialogue between the scientific community and governments, civil society, and the private sector.&quot;

Activities focused on three areas: International Research Collaboration, Science for Policy, and Universality of Science.

==History==
In July 2018, the ICSU became the International Science Council (ISC).

The ICSU itself was one of the oldest non-governmental organizations in the world, representing the evolution and expansion of two earlier bodies known as the International Association of Academies (IAA; 1899‚Äì1914) and the International Research Council (IRC; 1919‚Äì1931). In 1998, Members agreed that the Council&#x27;s current composition and activities would be better reflected by modifying the name from the International Council of Scientific Unions to the International Council for Science, while its rich history and strong identity would be well served by retaining the existing acronym, ICSU.

==Universality of science==

The Principle of Freedom and Responsibility in Science: the free and responsible practice of science is fundamental to scientific advancement and human and environmental well-being. Such practice, in all its aspects, requires freedom of movement, association, expression and communication for scientists, as well as equitable access to data, information, and other resources for research. It requires responsibility at all levels to carry out and communicate scientific work with integrity, respect, fairness, trustworthiness, and transparency, recognizing its benefits and possible harms. In advocating the free and responsible practice of science, the council promotes equitable opportunities for access to science and its benefits, and opposes discrimination based on such factors as ethnic origin, religion, citizenship, language, political or other opinion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or age.

The International Science Council&#x27;s Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in Science (CFRS) &quot;oversees this commitment and is the guardian of this work.&quot;

==Structure==
The ICSU Secretariat (20 staff in 2012) in Paris ensured the day-to-day planning and operations under the guidance of an elected executive board. Three Policy Committees ‚àí Committee on Scientific Planning and Review (CSPR), Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science (CFRS) and Committee on Finance ‚àí assisted the executive board in its work and a General Assembly of all Members was convened every three years. ICSU has three Regional Offices ‚àí Africa, Asia and the Pacific as well as Latin America and the Caribbean.

==Finances==
The principal source of ICSU&#x27;s finances was the contributions it receives from its members. Other sources of income are the framework contracts from UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) and grants and contracts from United Nations bodies, foundations and agencies, which are used to support the scientific activities of the ICSU Unions and interdisciplinary bodies.

<text>The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC ) is an international federation of National Adhering Organizations working for the advancement of the chemical sciences, especially by developing nomenclature and terminology. It is a member of the International Science Council (ISC). IUPAC is registered in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, and the administrative office, known as the &quot;IUPAC Secretariat&quot;, is in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, United States. IUPAC&#x27;s executive director heads this administrative office, currently Greta Heydenrych.

IUPAC was established in 1919 as the successor of the International Congress of Applied Chemistry for the advancement of chemistry. Its members, the National Adhering Organizations, can be national chemistry societies, national academies of sciences, or other bodies representing chemists. There are fifty-four National Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering Organizations. IUPAC&#x27;s Inter-divisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IUPAC nomenclature) is the recognized world authority in developing standards for naming the chemical elements and compounds. Since its creation, IUPAC has been run by many different committees with different responsibilities. These committees run different projects which include standardizing nomenclature, finding ways to bring chemistry to the world, and publishing works.

IUPAC is best known for its works standardizing nomenclature in chemistry, but IUPAC has publications in many science fields including chemistry, biology, and physics. Some important work IUPAC has done in these fields includes standardizing nucleotide base sequence code names; publishing books for environmental scientists, chemists, and physicists; and improving education in science. IUPAC is also known for standardizing the atomic weights of the elements through one of its oldest standing committees, the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights (CIAAW).

== Creation and history ==
The need for an international standard for chemistry was first addressed in 1860 by a committee headed by German scientist Friedrich August Kekul√© von Stradonitz. This committee was the first international conference to create an international naming system for organic compounds. The ideas that were formulated at that conference evolved into the official IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry. IUPAC is a legacy of this meeting, making it one of the most important historical international collaborations of chemistry societies. IUPAC as such was established in 1919.Since this time, IUPAC has been the official organization with the responsibility of updating and maintaining official organic nomenclature. 

One notable country excluded from early IUPAC was Germany. Germany&#x27;s exclusion was a result of prejudice towards it by the Allied powers after World War I. Germany was finally admitted into IUPAC in 1929. However, Nazi Germany was removed from IUPAC during World War II During World War II, IUPAC was affiliated with the Allied powers, but had little involvement with the war effort itself. East and West Germany were only readmitted to IUPAC in 1973. Since World War II, IUPAC has focused on standardizing nomenclature and methods in science.

In 2016, IUPAC denounced the use of chlorine as a chemical weapon. In a letter to Ahmet √úz√ºmc√º, director of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the organization pointed out their concerns in regards to chlorine weapon usage in the Syrian civil war and other places
. The letter stated, &quot;Our organizations deplore the use of chlorine in this manner. The indiscriminate attacks, possibly carried out by a member state of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), are of concern to chemical scientists and engineers around the globe and we stand ready to support your mission of implementing the CWC.&quot; According to the CWC, &quot;the use, stockpiling, distribution, development or storage of any chemical weapons is forbidden by any of the 192 state party signatories.&quot;

== Committees and governance ==
IUPAC is governed by several committees that all have different responsibilities. The committees are as follows: Bureau, CHEMRAWN (Chem Research Applied to World Needs) Committee, Committee on Chemistry Education, Committee on Chemistry and Industry, Committee on Printed and Electronic Publications, Evaluation Committee, Executive Committee, Finance Committee, Interdivisional Committee on Terminology, Nomenclature and Symbols, Project Committee, and Pure and Applied Chemistry Editorial Advisory Board. Each committee is made up of members of different National Adhering Organizations from different countries.

The steering committee hierarchy for IUPAC is as follows:
* All committees have an allotted budget to which they must adhere.
* Any committee may start a project.
* If a project&#x27;s spending becomes too much for a committee to continue funding, it must take the issue to the Project Committee.
* The project committee either increases the budget or decides on an external funding plan.
* The Bureau and Executive Committee oversee operations of the other committees.

== Nomenclature ==

Scientists framed a systematic method for naming organic compounds based on their structures. Hence, the naming rules were formulated by IUPAC.

=== Basic spellings ===
IUPAC establishes rules for harmonized spelling of some chemicals to reduce variation among different local English-language variants. For example, they recommend &quot;aluminium&quot; rather than &quot;aluminum&quot;, &quot;sulfur&quot; rather than &quot;sulphur&quot;, and &quot;caesium&quot; rather than &quot;cesium&quot;.

=== Organic nomenclature ===

IUPAC organic nomenclature has three basic parts: the substituents, carbon chain length, and chemical affix. The substituents are any functional groups attached to the main carbon chain. The main carbon chain is the longest possible continuous chain. The chemical affix denotes what type of molecule it is. For example, the ending &quot;ane&quot; denotes a single bonded carbon chain, as in &quot;hexane&quot; ().

Another example of IUPAC organic nomenclature is cyclohexanol:
* The substituent name for a ring compound is &quot;cyclo&quot;.
* The indication (substituent name) for a six carbon chain is &quot;hex&quot;.
* The chemical ending for a single bonded carbon chain is &quot;ane&quot;.
* The chemical ending for an alcohol is &quot;ol&quot;.
* The two chemical endings are combined for an ending of &quot;anol&quot; indicating a single bonded carbon chain with an alcohol attached to it.

=== Inorganic nomenclature ===

Basic IUPAC inorganic nomenclature has two main parts: the cation and the anion. The cation is the name for the positively charged ion and the anion is the name for the negatively charged ion.

An example of IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry is potassium chlorate (KClO3):
* &quot;Potassium&quot; is the cation name.
* &quot;Chlorate&quot; is the anion name.

== Amino acid and nucleotide base codes ==
IUPAC also has a system for giving codes to identify amino acids and nucleotide bases. IUPAC needed a coding system that represented long sequences of amino acids. This would allow for these sequences to be compared to try to find homologies. These codes can consist of either a one-letter code or a three-letter code.

These codes make it easier and shorter to write down the amino acid sequences that make up proteins. The nucleotide bases are made up of purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine or uracil). These nucleotide bases make up DNA and RNA. These nucleotide base codes make the genome of an organism much smaller and easier to read.

The codes for amino acids (22 amino acids and six special codes) are:
== Publications ==

=== Non-series books ===
=== &quot;Experimental Thermodynamics&quot; book series ===
The &quot;Experimental Thermodynamics&quot; books series covers many topics in the fields of thermodynamics.

=== Series of books on analytical and physical chemistry of environmental systems ===
=== Colored cover book and website series (nomenclature) ===

IUPAC color code their books in order to make each publication distinguishable.
== International Year of Chemistry ==
IUPAC and UNESCO were the lead organizations coordinating events for the International Year of Chemistry, which took place in 2011. The International Year of Chemistry was originally proposed by IUPAC at the general assembly in Turin, Italy. This motion was adopted by UNESCO at a meeting in 2008. The main objectives of the International Year of Chemistry were to increase public appreciation of chemistry and gain more interest in the world of chemistry. This event is also being held to encourage young people to get involved and contribute to chemistry. A further reason for this event being held is to honour how chemistry has made improvements to everyone&#x27;s way of life.

== IUPAC Presidents ==
IUPAC Presidents are elected by the IUPAC Council during the General Assembly. Below is the list of IUPAC Presidents since its inception in 1919.

<text>The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) (French: &quot;Organisation Hydrographique Internationale&quot;) is an intergovernmental organization representing hydrography. the IHO comprised 100 member states.

A principal aim of the IHO is to ensure that the world&#x27;s seas, oceans and navigable waters are properly surveyed and charted. It does this through the setting of international standards for hydrographic surveys, the co-ordination of the endeavors of the world&#x27;s national hydrographic offices, and through its capacity building program.

The IHO enjoys observer status at the United Nations, where it is the recognized competent authority on hydrographic surveying and nautical charting. When referring to hydrography and nautical charting in conventions and similar instruments, it is the IHO standards and specifications that are normally used.

== History ==
During the 19th century, many maritime nations established hydrographic offices to provide means for improving the navigation of naval and merchant vessels by providing nautical publications, nautical charts, and other navigational services. There were substantial differences in hydrographic procedures charts, and publications. In 1889, an International Maritime Conference was held at Washington, D.C., and it was proposed to establish a &quot;permanent international commission.&quot; Similar proposals were made at the sessions of the International Congress of Navigation held at Saint Petersburg in 1908 and the International Maritime Conference held at Saint Petersburg in 1912.

In 1919, the national Hydrographers of Great Britain and France cooperated in taking the necessary steps to convene an international conference of Hydrographers. London was selected as the most suitable place for this conference, and on 24 July 1919, the First International Conference opened, attended by the Hydrographers of 24 nations. The object of the conference was &quot;To consider the advisability of all maritime nations adopting similar methods in preparation, construction, and production of their charts and all hydrographic publications; of rendering the results in the most convenient form to enable them to be readily used; of instituting a prompt system of mutual exchange of hydrographic information between all countries; and of providing an opportunity to consultations and discussions to be carried out on hydrographic subjects generally by the hydrographic experts of the world.&quot; This is still the major purpose of the IHO.

As a result of the 1919 Conference, a permanent organization was formed and statutes for its operations were prepared. The IHB, now the IHO, began its activities in 1921 with 18 nations as members. The Principality of Monaco was selected as the seat of the Organization as a result of the offer of Albert I of Monaco to provide suitable accommodation for the Bureau in the Principality.

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) was established in June 1921 as the International Hydrographic Bureau (IHB), with Vice Admiral Sir John Parry, KCB of the United Kingdom serving as its first President. In 1970, under the leadership of Guy Chatel of France, the organization adopted its current name as part of a new International Convention on the IHO, which was agreed upon by its member nations. The term &quot;International Hydrographic Bureau&quot; continued to describe the IHO&#x27;s secretariat until 8 November 2016, when a major revision to the Convention took effect. Following this change, the secretariat was renamed the &quot;IHO Secretariat,&quot; which consists of an elected Secretary-General, two supporting Directors, and a small permanent staff (18 in 2020) at the Organization‚Äôs headquarters in Monaco.

== Structure ==
Until 2016 the IHO was administered by a secretariat headed by a Directing Committee comprising a President and two Directors. Since 8 November 2016, upon the entry in to force of revisions to the Convention on the IHO, the secretariat is headed by a Secretary-General, supported by two Directors, with Australia&#x27;s Robert Ward serving as the first Secretary-General. As before, all three senior members of the secretariat continue to be elected to their positions by the Member States at the regular Assembly of the IHO (formerly, IHO Conferences). 
The secretariat staff comprise a number of technical specialists, administrators, and support personnel. The bulk of the IHO&#x27;s technical and specialist expertise comes from Member States&#x27; personnel, often assisted by invited industry experts, who all provide technical contributions through participation in various IHO committees and working groups. 
A Council, comprising a sub-set of all the IHO Member States, meets annually and oversees the work of the IHO. A full description, together with details of the workings of all the organs of the IHO is available on the IHO website: www.iho.int 

== Functions ==

=== Training ===
The IHO ensures the safety of maritime navigation by developing hydrographic survey capability and nautical charting standards. To develop and standardize its member states&#x27; hydrographic survey capabilities, the IHO worked with the International Federation of Surveyors (F√©d√©ration Internationale des G√©om√®tres) and the International Cartographic Association (ICA) to create the IHO&#x27;s Standards of Competence. These standards are used to educate and train member states&#x27; respective hydrographic offices and nautical chart makers. Additionally, the IHO also creates syllabi higher education institutions who teach hydrography and nautical navigation. The IHO also has an Advisory Board which is tasked with supervising and approving member states&#x27; education and training programs. 

=== Standardization ===
Since 1968, the IHO has regularly published updated editions of the Standards of Hydrographic Surveys, with the most recent being published in 2008. Each of these publications was designed to incorporate technological advancements and international shipping demands. This is especially true with regards to the rise of electronic navigation equipment in the 1980s. 

The IHO also works to standardize the specifications, style, and symbols used in producing nautical charts. In 1971, the IHO was able to get its member states to use one single chart series, also known as INT charts. According to this IHO agreement, if one member state wants to publish a chart for an area covered by another member&#x27;s existing chart, the duplicate must be created using the same data as the original chart. IHO Publication M-4, which was published in 1984, set specific international standards for nautical charts.

The advent of the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) made it clear to the IHO it also needed to standardize how electronic navigational data is transferred and displayed on ships. Electronic chart data was standardized and categorized in an international database referred to as Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs). The way this data is transferred from publishers to users was also standardized, as was the display and capabilities of the ECDIS. 

=== International Cooperation ===
The IHO has encouraged the formation of Regional Hydrographic Commissions (RHCs). Each RHC coordinates the national surveying and charting activities of countries within each region and acts as a forum to address other matters of common hydrographic interest. The 15 RHCs plus the IHO Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica effectively cover the world. The IHO, in partnership with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, directs the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans program.

=== Achievements ===
Establishment of the Chart Specifications Committee and International Charts:
# The exploration of the seabed and movements of the sea
# Standardization of maritime measurements, hydrographic terminology, marine cartographic products, and geographical information systems for navigation
# High efficiency of the rapid dissemination of information on safety at sea
# Training of hydrographers and nautical cartographers

== Publications ==
Most IHO publications, including the standards, guidelines and associated documents such as the &quot;International Hydrographic Review&quot;, &quot;International Hydrographic Bulletin&quot;, the &quot;Hydrographic Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Year Book&quot; are available to the general public free of charge from the IHO website. The IHO publishes the international standards related to charting and hydrography, including S-57, &quot;IHO Transfer Standard for Digital Hydrographic Data&quot;, the encoding standard that is used primarily for electronic navigational charts.

In 2010, the IHO introduced a new, contemporary hydrographic geospatial standard for modelling marine data and information, known as S-100. S-100 and any dependent product specifications are underpinned by an on-line registry accessible via the IHO website. S-100 is aligned with the ISO 19100 series of geographic standards, thereby making it fully compatible with contemporary geospatial data standards.

Because S-100 is based on ISO 19100, it can be used by other data providers for their maritime-related (non-hydrographic) data and information. Various data and information providers from both the government and private sector are now using S-100 as part of the implementation of the e-Navigation concept that has been endorsed by the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Another in the series of publications of interest is S-23, &quot;Limits of Oceans and Seas&quot;. The 3rd edition dates back to 1953 while the potential 4th edition, started in 1986, has remained a draft since 2002. It was distributed to IHO members, but its official publication has been suspended pending agreement between South Korea and Japan regarding the international standard name of the sea called &quot;Japan Sea&quot; in the 1953 edition.

<text>IBM mainframes are large computer systems produced by IBM since 1952. During the 1960s and 1970s, IBM dominated the computer market with the 7000 series and the later System/360, followed by the System/370. Current mainframe computers in IBM&#x27;s line of business computers are developments of the basic design of the System/360.

==First and second generation==
From 1952 into the late 1960s, IBM manufactured and marketed several large computer models, known as the IBM 700/7000 series. The first-generation 700s were based on vacuum tubes, while the later, second-generation 7000s used transistors. These machines established IBM&#x27;s dominance in electronic data processing (&quot;EDP&quot;). IBM had two model categories: one (701, 704, 709, 7030, 7090, 7094, 7040, 7044) for engineering and scientific use, and one (702, 705, 705-II, 705-III, 7080, 7070, 7072, 7074, 7010) for commercial or data processing use. The two categories, scientific and commercial, generally used common peripherals but had completely different instruction sets, and there were incompatibilities even within each category.

IBM initially sold its computers without any software, expecting customers to write their own; programs were manually initiated, one at a time. Later, IBM provided compilers for the newly developed higher-level programming languages Fortran, COMTRAN and later COBOL. The first operating systems for IBM computers were written by IBM customers who did not wish to have their very expensive machines (US$2M in the mid-1950s) sitting idle while operators set up jobs manually. These first operating systems were essentially scheduled work queues. It is generally thought the first operating system used for real work was GM-NAA I/O, produced by General Motors&#x27; Research division in 1956. IBM enhanced one of GM-NAA I/O&#x27;s successors, the SHARE Operating System, and provided it to customers under the name IBSYS. As software became more complex and important, the cost of supporting it on so many different designs became burdensome, and this was one of the factors which led IBM to develop System/360 and its operating systems.

The second generation (transistor-based) products were a mainstay of IBM&#x27;s business and IBM continued to make them for several years after the introduction of the System/360. (Some IBM 7094s remained in service into the 1980s.)

==Smaller machines==
Prior to System/360, IBM also sold computers smaller in scale that were not considered mainframes, though they were still bulky and expensive by modern standards. These included:
* IBM 650 (vacuum tube logic, decimal architecture, drum memory, business and scientific)
* IBM 305 RAMAC (vacuum tube logic, first computer with disk storage; &quot;see:&quot; Early IBM disk storage)
* IBM 1400 series (business data processing; very successful and many 1400 peripherals were used with the 360s)
* IBM 1620 (decimal architecture, engineering, scientific, and education)

IBM had difficulty getting customers to upgrade from the smaller machines to the mainframes because so much software had to be rewritten. The 7010 was introduced in 1962 as a mainframe-sized 1410. The later Systems 360 and 370 could emulate the 1400 machines. A desk-size machine with a different instruction set, the IBM 1130, was released concurrently with the System/360 to address the niche occupied by the 1620. It used the same EBCDIC character encoding as the 360 and was mostly programmed in Fortran, which was relatively easy to adapt to larger machines when necessary.

IBM also introduced smaller machines after S/360. These included:
* IBM System/7 (semiconductor memory, process control, incompatible replacement for IBM 1800
* IBM Series/1
* IBM 3790
* IBM 8100
* IBM System/3 (Introduced 96 column card)

&quot;Midrange computer&quot; is a designation used by IBM for a class of computer systems which fall in between mainframes and microcomputers.

==IBM System/360==


IBM announced the System/360 (S/360) line of mainframes in April 1964. The System/360 was a single series of compatible models for both commercial and scientific use. The number &quot;360&quot; suggested a &quot;360 degree,&quot; or &quot;all-around&quot; computer system. System/360 incorporated features which had previously been present on only either the commercial line (such as decimal arithmetic and byte addressing) or the engineering and scientific line (such as floating-point arithmetic). Some of the arithmetic units and addressing features were optional on some models of the System/360. However, models were upward compatible and most were also downward compatible. The System/360 was also the first computer in wide use to include dedicated hardware provisions for the use of operating systems. Among these were supervisor and application mode programs and instructions, as well as built-in memory protection facilities. Hardware memory protection was provided to protect the operating system from the user programs (tasks) and user tasks from each other. The new machine also had a larger address space than the older mainframes, 24 bits addressing 8-bit bytes vs. a typical 18 bits addressing 36-bit words. 

The smaller models in the System/360 line (e.g. the 360/30) were intended to replace the 1400 series while providing an easier upgrade path to the larger 360s. To smooth the transition from the second generation to the new line, IBM used the 360&#x27;s microprogramming capability to emulate the more popular older models. Thus 360/30s with this added cost feature could run 1401 programs and the larger 360/65s could run 7094 programs. To run old programs, the 360 had to be halted and restarted in emulation mode. Many customers kept using their old software and one of the features of the later System/370 was the ability to switch to emulation mode and back under operating system control.

Operating systems for the System/360 family included OS/360 (with PCP, MFT, and MVT), BOS/360, TOS/360, and DOS/360.

The System/360 later evolved into the System/370, the System/390, and the 64-bit zSeries, System z, and zEnterprise machines. System/370 introduced virtual memory capabilities in all models other than the first System/370 models; the OS/VS1 variant of OS/360 MFT, the OS/VS2 (SVS) variant of OS/360 MVT, and the DOS/VS variant of DOS/360 were introduced to use the virtual memory capabilities, followed by MVS, which, unlike the earlier virtual-memory operating systems, ran separate programs in separate address spaces, rather than running all programs in a single virtual address space. The virtual memory capabilities also allowed the system to support virtual machines; the VM/370 hypervisor would run one or more virtual machines running either standard System/360 or System/370 operating systems or the single-user Conversational Monitor System (CMS). A time-sharing VM system could run multiple virtual machines, one per user, with each virtual machine running an instance of CMS.

==Today&#x27;s systems==


The IBM Z family, introduced in 2000 with the z900, supports z/Architecture, which extends the architecture used by the System/390 mainframes to 64 bits.

===Processor units===
The different processors on current IBM mainframes are:
* CP, central processor: general-purpose processor
* IFL, Integrated Facility for Linux: dedicated to Linux OSes (optionally under z/VM)
* ICF, Integrated Coupling Facility: designed to support Parallel Sysplex operations
* SAP, System Assist Processor: designed to handle various system accounting, management, and I/O channel operations
* zAAP, System z Application Assist Processor: currently limited to run only Java and XML processing
* zIIP, System z Integrated Information Processor: dedicated to run specific workloads including IBM Db2, XML, and IPSec

These are essentially identical, but distinguished for software cost control: all but CP are slightly restricted such they cannot be used to run arbitrary operating systems, and thus do not count in software licensing costs (which are typically based on the number of CPs).
There are other supporting processors typically installed inside mainframes such as cryptographic accelerators (CryptoExpress), the OSA-Express networking processor, and FICON Express disk I/O processors.

Software to allow users to run &quot;traditional&quot; workloads on zIIPs and zAAPs was briefly marketed by Neon Enterprise Software as &quot;zPrime&quot; but was withdrawn from the market in 2011 after a lawsuit by IBM.

===Operating systems===
The primary operating systems in use on current IBM mainframes include z/OS (which followed MVS/ESA and OS/390 in the OS/360 lineage), z/VM (which followed VM/ESA and VM/XA SP in the CP-40 lineage), z/VSE (which is in the DOS/360 lineage), z/TPF (a successor of Transaction Processing Facility in the Airlines Control Program lineage), and Linux on IBM Z (e.g., Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server). Some systems run MUSIC/SP, as well as UTS (Mainframe UNIX). In October 2008, Sine Nomine Associates introduced OpenSolaris on System z; it has since been discontinued.

===Middleware===
Current IBM mainframes run all the major enterprise transaction processing environments and databases, including CICS, IMS, WebSphere Application Server, IBM Db2, and Oracle. In many cases these software subsystems can run on more than one mainframe operating system.

===Emulators===
There are software-based emulators for the System/370, System/390, and System z hardware, including FLEX-ES, which runs under UnixWare or Linux, and the freely available Hercules, which runs under Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, macOS and Microsoft Windows.
IBM offers an emulator called zPDT (System z Personal Development Tool) which runs on Linux on x86-64 machines.

<text>Iowa State University of Science and Technology (Iowa State University, Iowa State, or ISU) is a public land-grant research university in Ames, Iowa, United States. Founded in 1858 as the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm, Iowa State became one of the nation&#x27;s first designated land-grant institutions when the Iowa Legislature accepted the provisions of the 1862 Morrill Act on September 11, 1862. On July 4, 1959, the college was officially renamed Iowa State University of Science and Technology.

Iowa State is the second largest university in Iowa by total enrollment. The university&#x27;s academic offerings are administered through eight colleges, including the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, the College of Veterinary Medicine, the College of Engineering, the Graduate College, the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, the College of Design, Debbie and Jerry Ivy College of Business, and the College of Human Sciences. They offer over 100 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 120 master&#x27;s degree programs, and 80 doctoral degree programs, plus a professional degree program in Veterinary Medicine.

Iowa State is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì Very high research activity.&quot; The university is affiliated with the Ames National Laboratory, the Biorenewables Research Laboratory, the Plant Sciences Institute, and various other research institutes. Iowa State University&#x27;s athletic teams, the Cyclones, compete in Division I of the NCAA and are a founding member of the Big 12.

== History ==
In 1856, the Iowa General Assembly enacted legislation to establish the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm. This institution (now Iowa State University) was officially established on March 22, 1858, by the General Assembly. Story County was chosen as the location on June 21, 1859, beating proposals from Johnson, Kossuth, Marshall and Polk counties. The original farm of was purchased at a cost of $5,379.

Iowa was the first state in the nation to accept the provisions of the Morrill Act of 1862. The state subsequently designated Iowa State as the land-grant college on March 29, 1864. Iowa State University is one of four universities that claims to be the first land-grant institution in the United States, the others being Kansas State University, Michigan State University, and the Pennsylvania State University. 

From the start, Iowa Agricultural College focused on the ideals that higher education should be accessible to all and that the university should teach liberal and practical subjects. These ideals are integral to the land-grant university.

The institution has been coeducational since the first class admitted in 1868. Formal admissions began the following year, and the first graduating class of 1872 consisted of 24 men and two women.

The Farm House, the first building on the Iowa State campus, was completed in 1861 before the campus was occupied by students or classrooms. It became the home of the superintendent of the Model Farm and in later years, the deans of Agriculture, including Seaman Knapp and James &quot;Tama Jim&quot; Wilson. Iowa State&#x27;s first president, Adonijah Welch, briefly stayed at the Farm House and penned his inaugural speech in a second floor bedroom.

The Iowa Experiment Station was one of the university&#x27;s prominent features. Practical courses of instruction were taught, including one designed to give a general training for the career of a farmer. Courses in mechanical, civil, electrical, and mining engineering were also part of the curriculum.

In 1870, President Welch and I. P. Roberts, professor of agriculture, held three-day farmers&#x27; institutes at Cedar Falls, Council Bluffs, Washington, and Muscatine. These became the earliest institutes held off-campus by a land grant institution and were the forerunners of 20th century extension.

In 1872, the first courses were given in domestic economy (home economics, family and consumer sciences) and were taught by Mary B. Welch, the president&#x27;s wife. Iowa State became the first land grant university to offer training in domestic economy for college credit.

In 1879, the School of Veterinary Science was organized, becoming the first state veterinary college in the United States. This was originally a two-year course leading to a diploma. The veterinary course of study contained classes in zoology, botany, anatomy of domestic animals, veterinary obstetrics, and sanitary science.

William Miller Beardshear was appointed President of Iowa State in 1891. During his tenure, Iowa Agricultural College truly came of age. Beardshear developed new agricultural programs and was instrumental in hiring premier faculty members such as Anson Marston, Louis B. Spinney, J.B. Weems, Perry G. Holden, and Maria Roberts. He also expanded the university administration, and added Morrill Hall (1891), the Campanile (1899), Old Botany (now Carrie Chapman Catt Hall) (1892), and Margaret Hall (1895) to the campus, all of which stand today except for Margaret Hall, which was destroyed by a fire in 1938. In his honor, Iowa State named its central administrative building (Central Building) after Beardshear in 1925. In 1898, reflecting the school&#x27;s growth during his tenure, it was renamed Iowa State College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts, or Iowa State for short.

Today, Beardshear Hall holds the offices of the President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Secretary, Registrar, Provost, and student financial aid. Catt Hall is named after alumna and famed suffragette Carrie Chapman Catt, and is the home of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

In 1912, Iowa State had its first Homecoming celebration. The idea was first proposed by Professor Samuel Beyer, the college&#x27;s &quot;patron saint of athletics&quot;, who suggested that Iowa State inaugurate a celebration for alumni during the annual football game against rival University of Iowa. Iowa State&#x27;s new president, Raymond A. Pearson, liked the idea and issued a special invitation to alumni two weeks prior to the event: &quot;We need you, we must have you. Come and see what a school you have made in Iowa State College. Find a way.&quot; In October 2012 Iowa State marked its 100th Homecoming with a &quot;CYtennial&quot; Celebration.

Iowa State celebrated its first VEISHEA on May 11‚Äì13, 1922. Wallace McKee (class of 1922) served as the first chairman of the Central Committee and Frank D. Paine (professor of electrical engineering) chose the name, based on the first letters of Iowa State&#x27;s colleges: Veterinary Medicine, Engineering, Industrial Science, Home Economics, and Agriculture. VEISHEA grew to become the largest student-run festival in the nation.

The Statistical Laboratory was established in 1933, with George W. Snedecor, professor of mathematics, as the first director. It was and is the first research and consulting institute of its kind in the country.

While attempting to develop a faster method of computation, mathematics and physics professor John Vincent Atanasoff conceptualized the basic tenets of what would become the world&#x27;s first electronic digital computer, the Atanasoff‚ÄìBerry Computer (ABC), during a drive to Illinois in 1937. These included the use of a binary system of arithmetic, the separation of computer and memory functions, and regenerative drum memory, among others. The 1939 prototype was constructed with graduate student Clifford Berry in the basement of the Physics Building.

During World War II, Iowa State was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

On July 4, 1959, the college was officially renamed Iowa State University of Science and Technology. However, the short-form name &quot;Iowa State University&quot; is used even in official documents, such as diplomas. Official names given to the university&#x27;s divisions were the College of Agriculture, College of Engineering, College of Home Economics, College of Sciences and Humanities, and College of Veterinary Medicine.

Iowa State&#x27;s eight colleges today offer more than 100 undergraduate majors and 200 fields of study leading to graduate and professional degrees. The academic program at ISU includes a liberal arts education and research in the biological and physical sciences. The focus on technology has led directly to many research patents and inventions including the first binary computer, the ABC, Maytag blue cheese, and the round hay baler.

Located on a campus, the university has grown considerably from its roots as an agricultural college and model farm and is recognized internationally today for its comprehensive research programs. It continues to grow and set a new record for enrollment in the fall of 2015 with 36,001 students.

=== Manhattan Project ===
Iowa State played a role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project, a research and development program begun in 1942 under the Army Corps of Engineers.

The process to produce large quantities of high-purity uranium metal became known as the Ames process. One-third of the uranium metal used in the world&#x27;s first controlled nuclear chain reaction was produced at Iowa State under the direction of Frank Spedding and Harley Wilhelm. The Ames Project received the Army/Navy E Award for Excellence in Production on October 12, 1945, for its work with metallic uranium as a vital war material. Today, ISU is the only university in the United States that has a U.S. Department of Energy research laboratory physically located on its campus.

=== Atanasoff‚ÄìBerry Computer ===

Iowa State is the birthplace of the first electronic digital computer, starting the world&#x27;s computer technology revolution. Invented by mathematics and physics professor John Atanasoff and engineering graduate student Clifford Berry during 1937‚Äì42, the Atanasoff‚ÄìBerry Computer pioneered important elements of modern computing.

On October 19, 1973, U.S. Federal Judge Earl R. Larson signed his decision following a lengthy court trial which declared the ENIAC patent of Mauchly and Eckert invalid and named Atanasoff the inventor of the electronic digital computer‚Äîthe Atanasoff‚ÄìBerry Computer or the ABC.

An ABC Team consisting of Ames Laboratory and Iowa State engineers, technicians, researchers and students unveiled a working replica of the Atanasoff‚ÄìBerry Computer in 1997 which can be seen on display on campus in the Durham Computation Center.

== Campus ==
Iowa State&#x27;s campus contains over 160 buildings. Several buildings, as well as the Marston Water Tower, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The central campus includes of trees, plants, and classically designed buildings. The landscape&#x27;s most dominant feature is the central lawn, which was listed as a &quot;medallion site&quot; by the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1999.

Thomas Gaines, in &quot;The Campus As a Work of Art&quot;, claimed that the Iowa State campus was one of the twenty-five most beautiful campuses in the country.

=== Campanile ===
The campanile was constructed during 1897-1898 as a memorial to Margaret MacDonald Stanton, Iowa State&#x27;s first dean of women, who died on July 25, 1895. The tower is located on ISU&#x27;s central campus, just north of the Memorial Union. The site was selected by Margaret&#x27;s husband, Edgar W. Stanton, with the help of then-university president William M. Beardshear. The campanile stands tall on a 16 by 16 foot (5 by 5 m) base, and cost $6,510.20 to construct.

The campanile is widely seen as one of the major symbols of Iowa State University. It is featured prominently on the university&#x27;s official ring and the university&#x27;s mace, and is also the subject of the university&#x27;s alma mater, &quot;The Bells of Iowa State&quot;.

=== Lake LaVerne ===
Named for Dr. LaVerne W. Noyes, who also donated the funds to see that Alumni Hall could be completed after sitting unfinished and unused from 1905 to 1907. Dr. Noyes is an 1872 alumnus. Lake LaVerne is located west of the Memorial Union and south of Alumni Hall, Carver Hall, and Music Hall. The lake was a gift from Dr. Noyes in 1916.

Lake LaVerne is the home of two mute swans named Sir Lancelot and Elaine, donated to Iowa State by VEISHEA 1935. In 1944, 1970, and 1971 cygnets (baby swans) made their home on Lake LaVerne. Previously Sir Lancelot and Elaine were trumpeter swans but were too aggressive and in 1999 were replaced with two mute swans.

In early spring 2003, Lake LaVerne welcomed its newest and most current mute swan duo. In support of Iowa Department of Natural Resources efforts to re-establish the trumpeter swans in Iowa, university officials avoided bringing breeding pairs of male and female mute swans to Iowa State which means the current Sir Lancelot and Elaine are both female.

=== Reiman Gardens ===

Iowa State has maintained a horticulture garden since 1914. Reiman Gardens is the third location for these gardens. Today&#x27;s gardens began in 1993 with a gift from Bobbi and Roy Reiman. Construction began in 1994 and the Gardens&#x27; initial were officially dedicated on September 16, 1995.

Reiman Gardens has since grown to become a site consisting of a dozen distinct garden areas, an indoor conservatory and an indoor butterfly &quot;wing&quot;, butterfly emergence cases, a gift shop, and several supporting greenhouses. Located immediately south of Jack Trice Stadium on the ISU campus, Reiman Gardens is a year-round facility that has become one of the most visited attractions in central Iowa.

The Gardens has received a number of national, state, and local awards since its opening, and its rose gardens are particularly noteworthy. It was honored with the President&#x27;s Award in 2000 by All American Rose Selections, Inc., which is presented to one public garden in the United States each year for superior rose maintenance and display: &quot;For contributing to the public interest in rose growing through its efforts in maintaining an outstanding public rose garden.&quot;

=== University museums ===
The university museums consist of the Brunnier Art Museum, Farm House Museum, the Art on Campus Program, the Christian Petersen Art Museum, and the Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden. 

==== Brunnier Art Museum ====
The Brunnier Art Museum, Iowa&#x27;s only accredited museum emphasizing a decorative arts collection, is one of the nation&#x27;s few museums located within a performing arts and conference complex, the Iowa State Center. Founded in 1975, the museum is named after its benefactors, Iowa State alumnus Henry J. Brunnier and his wife Ann. The decorative arts collection they donated, called the Brunnier Collection, is extensive, consisting of ceramics, glass, dolls, ivory, jade, and enameled metals.

Other fine and decorative art objects from the University Art Collection include prints, paintings, sculptures, textiles, carpets, wood objects, lacquered pieces, silver, and furniture. About eight to 12 annual changing exhibitions and permanent collection exhibitions provide educational opportunities. Lectures, receptions, conferences, university classes, panel discussions, gallery walks, and gallery talks are presented to assist with further interpretation of objects.

==== Farm House Museum ====
Located near the center of the Iowa State campus, the Farm House Museum sits as a monument to early Iowa State history and culture as well as a National Historic Landmark. As the first building on campus, the Farm House was built in 1860 before campus was occupied by students or even classrooms. The college&#x27;s first farm tenants primed the land for agricultural experimentation. This early practice lead to Iowa State Agricultural College and Model Farm opening its doors to Iowa students for free in 1869 under the Morrill Act (or Land-grant Act) of 1862.

Many prominent figures have made the Farm House their home throughout its 150 years of use. The first president of the college, Adonijah Welch, briefly stayed at the Farm House and even wrote his inaugural speech in a bedroom on the second floor. James &quot;Tama Jim&quot; Wilson resided for much of the 1890s with his family at the Farm House until he joined President William McKinley&#x27;s cabinet as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. Agriculture Dean Charles Curtiss and his young family replaced Wilson and became the longest resident of Farm House.

In 1976, over 110 years after the initial construction, the Farm House became a museum after much time and effort was put into restoring the early beauty of the modest farm home. Today, faculty, students, and community members can enjoy the museum while honoring its significance in shaping a nationally recognized land-grant university. Its collection boasts a large collection of 19th and early 20th century decorative arts, furnishings and material culture reflecting Iowa State and Iowa heritage. Objects include furnishings from Carrie Chapman Catt and Charles Curtiss, a wide variety of quilts, a modest collection of textiles and apparel, and various china and glassware items.

The Farm House Museum is an on-campus educational resource providing a changing environment of exhibitions among the historical permanent collection objects that are on display.

==== Art on Campus Collection ====
Iowa State is home to one of the largest campus public art programs in the United States. Over 2,000 works of public art, including 600 by significant national and international artists, are located across campus in buildings, courtyards, open spaces and offices.

The traditional public art program began during the Depression in the 1930s when Iowa State College&#x27;s President Raymond Hughes envisioned that &quot;the arts would enrich and provide substantial intellectual exploration into our college curricula.&quot; Hughes invited Grant Wood to create the Library&#x27;s agricultural murals that speak to the founding of Iowa and Iowa State College and Model Farm. He also offered Christian Petersen a one-semester sculptor residency to design and build the fountain and bas relief at the Dairy Industry Building. In 1955, 21 years later, Petersen retired having created 12 major sculptures for the campus and hundreds of small studio sculptures.

The Art on Campus Collection is a campus-wide resource of over 2000 public works of art. Programs, receptions, dedications, university classes, Wednesday Walks, and educational tours are presented on a regular basis.

==== Christian Petersen Art Museum ====

The Christian Petersen Art Museum in Morrill Hall is named for the nation&#x27;s first permanent campus artist-in-residence, Christian Petersen, who sculpted and taught at Iowa State from 1934 through 1955, and is considered the founding artist of the Art on Campus Collection.

Named for Justin Smith Morrill who created the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, Morrill Hall was completed in 1891. Originally constructed to fill the capacity of a library, museum, and chapel, its original uses are engraved in the exterior stonework on the east side. The building was vacated in 1996 when it was determined unsafe and was also listed in the National Register of Historic Places the same year. In 2005, $9 million was raised to renovate the building and convert it into a museum. Completed and reopened in March 2007, Morrill Hall is home to the Christian Petersen Art Museum.

As part of University Museums, the Christian Petersen Art Museum at Morrill Hall is the home of the Christian Petersen Art Collection, the Art on Campus Program, the University Museums&#x27;s Visual Literacy and Learning Program, and Contemporary Changing Art Exhibitions Program.

Located within the Christian Petersen Art Museum are the Lyle and Nancy Campbell Art Gallery, the Roy and Bobbi Reiman Public Art Studio Gallery, the Margaret Davidson Center for the Study of the Art on Campus Collection, the Edith D. and Torsten E. Lagerstrom Loaned Collections Center, and the Neva M. Petersen Visual Learning Gallery. University Museums shares the James R. and Barbara R. Palmer Small Objects Classroom in Morrill Hall.

==== Anderson Sculpture Garden ====
The Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden is located by the Christian Petersen Art Museum at historic Morrill Hall. The sculpture garden design incorporates sculptures, a gathering arena, and sidewalks and pathways. Planted with perennials, ground cover, shrubs, and flowering trees, the landscape design provides a setting for works of 20th and 21st century sculpture, primarily American. Ranging from forty-four inches to nearly nine feet high and from bronze to other metals, these works of art represent both modern and contemporary sculpture.

The sculpture garden is adjacent to Iowa State&#x27;s central campus.

=== Sustainability ===
Iowa State&#x27;s composting facility is capable of processing over 10,000 tons of organic waste every year. The school&#x27;s $3 million revolving loan fund loans money for energy efficiency and conservation projects on campus. In the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card issued by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, the university received a B grade.

=== Parks Library ===

The W. Robert and Ellen Sorge Parks Library contains over 2.6 million books and subscribes to more than 98,600 journal titles. Named for W. Robert Parks (1915‚Äì2003), the 11th president of Iowa State University, and his wife, Ellen Sorge Parks, the original library was built in 1925 with three subsequent additions made in 1961, 1969, and 1983. The library was dedicated and named after W. Robert and Ellen Sorge Parks in 1984.

Surrounding the first floor lobby staircase in Parks Library are eight mural panels designed by Iowa artist Grant Wood. As with &quot;Breaking the Prairie Sod&quot;, Wood&#x27;s other Iowa State University mural painted two years later, Wood borrowed his theme for &quot;When Tillage Begins Other Arts Follow&quot; from a speech on agriculture delivered by Daniel Webster in 1840 at the State House in Boston, in which farmers were portrayed as the founders of human civilization.

=== Intensive English and Orientation Program ===
The university has an IEOP for foreign students. Students whose native language is not English can take IEOP courses to improve their English proficiency to help them succeed at University-level study. IEOP course content also helps students prepare for English proficiency exams, like the TOEFL and IELTS. Classes included in the IEOP include Grammar, Reading, Writing, Oral Communication and Business and various bridge classes.

=== Cooperative extension ===
The cooperative extension service traces its roots to farmers&#x27; institutes developed at Iowa State in the late 19th century. Committed to community, Iowa State pioneered the outreach mission of being a land-grant college through creation of the first Extension Service in 1902. In 1906, the Iowa Legislature enacted the Agricultural Extension Act making funds available for demonstration projects. It is believed this was the first specific legislation establishing state extension work, for which Iowa State assumed responsibility. The national extension program was created in 1914 based heavily on the Iowa State model.

== Research ==
Iowa State University is a member of the Universities Research Association, University Corporation for Atmospheric Research and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. In 2020, Iowa State spent $363.1 million in R&amp;D.

Iowa State was a member of the Association of American Universities from 1958 until April 2022. It departed claiming that AAU&#x27;s internal ranking indicators unfairly favor institutions with high levels of NIH funding and noted that its strength is not in biomedical research because the school does not have a medical school.

=== Ames National Laboratory ===
Iowa State is the only university in the United States that has a U.S. Department of Energy research laboratory physically located on its campus. Operated by Iowa State, Ames National Laboratory is one of ten national DOE Office of Science research laboratories.

ISU research for the government provided Ames National Laboratory its start in the 1940s with the development of a highly efficient process for producing high-purity uranium for atomic energy. Today, Ames National Laboratory continues its leading status in current materials research and focuses diverse fundamental and applied research strengths upon issues of national concern, cultivates research talent, and develops and transfers technologies to improve industrial competitiveness and enhance U.S. economic security. Ames National Laboratory employs more than 500 full- and part-time employees. Students make up more than 45 percent of the paid workforce.

Dan Shechtman, awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of quasicrystals at Johns Hopkins University, is an Associate of Ames National Laboratory.

=== ISU Research Park ===
The ISU Research Park Corporation was established in 1987 as a not-for-profit, independent, corporation operating under a board of directors appointed by Iowa State University and the ISU Foundation. The corporation manages both the Research Park and incubator programs.

=== Other research institutes ===
In 2010, the Biorenewables Research Laboratory opened in a LEED-Gold certified building that complements and helps replace labs and offices across Iowa State and promotes interdisciplinary, systems-level research and collaboration. The Lab houses the Bioeconomy Institute, the Biobased Industry Center, and the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Biorenewable Chemicals, a partnership of six universities as well as the Max Planck Society in Germany and the Technical University of Denmark.

The Engineering Teaching and Research Complex was built in 1999 and is home to Stanley and Helen Howe Hall and Gary and Donna Hoover Hall. The complex is occupied by the Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC), Center for Industrial Research and Service (CIRAS), Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Engineering Computer Support Services, Engineering Distance Education, and Iowa Space Grant Consortium. And the complex contains one of the world&#x27;s only six-sided immersive virtual reality labs (C6), as well as the 240 seat 3D-capable Alliant Energy Lee Liu Auditorium, the Multimodal Experience Testbed and Laboratory (METaL), and the User Experience Lab (UX Lab). All of which supports the research of more than 50 faculty and 200 graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral students.

The Plant Sciences Institute was founded in 1999. PSI&#x27;s research focus is to understand the effects of genotype (genetic makeup) and environment on phenotypes (traits) sufficiently well that it will be able to predict the phenotype of a given genotype in a given environment. The institute is housed in the Roy J. Carver Co-Laboratory and is home to the Plant Sciences Institute Faculty Scholars program.

There is also the Iowa State University Northeast Research Farm in Nashua.

== Student life ==
=== Residence halls ===
Iowa State operates 20 on-campus residence halls. The residence halls are divided into geographical areas.

The Union Drive Association
(UDA) consists of four residence halls located on the west side of campus, including Friley Hall, which has been declared one of the largest residence halls in the country.

The Richardson Court Association (RCA) consists of 12 residence halls on the east side of campus.

The Towers Residence Association (TRA) are located south of the main campus. Two of the four towers, Knapp and Storms Halls, were imploded in 2005; however, Wallace and Wilson Halls still stand.

Buchanan Hall and Geoffroy Hall are nominally considered part of the RCA, despite their distance from the other buildings.

ISU operates two apartment complexes for upperclassmen, Frederiksen Court and SUV Apartments.

=== Student government ===
The governing body for ISU students is ISU Student Government. The ISU Student Government is composed of a president, vice president, finance director, cabinet appointed by the president, a clerk appointed by the vice president, senators representing each college and residence area at the university, a nine-member judicial branch and an election commission.

=== Student organizations ===

ISU has over 900 student organizations on campus that represent a variety of interests. Organizations are supported by Iowa State&#x27;s Student Engagement Office. Many student organization offices are housed in the Memorial Union.

The Memorial Union at Iowa State University opened in September 1928 and is currently home to a number of University departments and student organizations, The M-Shop, CyBowl &amp; Billiards, the University Book Store, and the Workspace.

The original building was designed by architect, William T. Proudfoot. The building employs a classical style of architecture reflecting Greek and Roman influences. The building&#x27;s design specifically complements the designs of the major buildings surrounding the University&#x27;s Central Campus area, Beardshear Hall to the west, Curtiss Hall to the east, and MacKay Hall to the north. The style utilizes columns with Corinthian capitals, Palladian windows, triangular pediments, and formally balanced facades.

Designed to be a living memorial for ISU students lost in World War I, the building includes a solemn memorial hall, named the Gold Star Room, which honors the names of the dead World War I, World War II, Korean, Vietnam, and War on Terrorism veterans engraved in marble. Symbolically, the hall was built directly over a library (the Browsing Library) and a small chapel, the symbol being that no country would ever send its young men to die in a war for a noble cause without a solid foundation on both education (the library) and religion (the chapel). On Veterans Day in 2014, ISU&#x27;s &quot;Gold Star Hall&quot; publicly honored Petty Officer Jerry Leroy Converse, a U.S. Navy sailor that was killed by Israel during the 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident. Converse is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Cherokee, Iowa. This ceremony came 47 years after the attack.

Renovations and additions have continued through the years to include: elevators, bowling lanes, a parking ramp, a book store, food court, and additional wings.

=== Fraternities and sororities ===
Fraternities and sororities at ISU include fifty chapters that involve 14.6 percent of undergraduate students. Collectively, fraternity and sorority members have raised over $82,000 for philanthropies and committed 31,416 hours to community service. In 2006, the ISU Greek community was named the best large Greek community in the Midwest.

The first fraternity, Delta Tau Delta, was established at Iowa State in 1875, six years after the first graduating class entered Iowa State. The first sorority, I.C. Sorocis, was established two years later, in 1877. I.C. Sorocis later became a chapter of the first national sorority at Iowa State, Pi Beta Phi. Anti-Greek rioting occurred in 1888. As reported in &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot;, &quot;The anti-secret society men of the college met in a mob last night about 11 o&#x27;clock in front of the society rooms in chemical and physical hall, determined to break up a joint meeting of three secret societies.&quot; In 1891, President William Beardshear banned students from joining secret college fraternities, resulting in the eventual closing of all formerly established fraternities. President Storms lifted the ban in 1904. Following the lifting of the fraternity ban, thirteen national fraternities were installed on the Iowa State campus between 1904 and 1913.

=== Media ===

The &quot;Iowa State Daily&quot; is the university&#x27;s student newspaper. The &quot;Daily&quot; has its roots from a news sheet titled the &quot;Clipper&quot;, which was started in the spring of 1890 by a group of students at Iowa Agricultural College led by F.E. Davidson. The &quot;Clipper&quot; soon led to the creation of the &quot;Iowa Agricultural College Student&quot;, and the beginnings of what would one day become the &quot;Iowa State Daily&quot;. It was awarded the 2016 Best All-Around Daily Student Newspaper by the Society of Professional Journalists.

88.5 KURE is the university&#x27;s student-run radio station.

ISUtv is the university&#x27;s student-run television station. It is housed in the former WOI-TV station that was established in 1950.

=== VEISHEA celebration ===
Iowa State is widely known for VEISHEA, an annual education and entertainment festival that was held on campus each spring. The name VEISHEA was derived from the initials of ISU&#x27;s five original colleges, forming an acronym as the university existed when the festival was founded in 1922. VEISHEA was the largest student-run festival in the nation, bringing in tens of thousands of visitors to the campus each year. VEISHEA was retired as an annual event at Iowa State in 2014.

The celebration featured an annual parade and many open-house demonstrations of the university facilities and departments. Campus organizations exhibited products, technologies, and held fund raisers for various charity groups. In addition, VEISHEA brought speakers, lecturers, and entertainers to Iowa State, and throughout its over eight decade history, it has hosted such distinguished guests as Bob Hope, John Wayne, Presidents Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan, and Lyndon Johnson, and performers Diana Ross, Billy Joel, Sonny and Cher, The Who, The Goo Goo Dolls, Bobby V, and The Black Eyed Peas.

== Athletics ==
The &quot;Cyclones&quot; name dates back to 1895. That year, Iowa suffered an unusually high number of devastating cyclones (as tornadoes were called at the time). In September, Iowa Agricultural College&#x27;s football team traveled to Northwestern University and defeated that team by a score of 36‚Äì0. The next day, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s headline read &quot;Struck by a Cyclone: It Comes from Iowa and Devastates Evanston Town.&quot; The article began, &quot;Northwestern might as well have tried to play football with an Iowa cyclone as with the Iowa team it met yesterday.&quot; The nickname stuck.

The school colors are cardinal and gold. The mascot is Cy the Cardinal, introduced in 1954. Since a cyclone was determined to be difficult to depict in costume, the cardinal was chosen in reference to the school colors. A contest was held to select a name for the mascot, with the name Cy being chosen as the winner.

The Iowa State Cyclones are a member of the Big 12 Conference and compete in NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), fielding 16 varsity teams in 12 sports. The Cyclones also compete in and are a founding member of the Central States Collegiate Hockey League of the American Collegiate Hockey Association.

Iowa State&#x27;s intrastate archrival is the University of Iowa with whom it competes annually for the Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series trophy, an annual athletic competition between the two schools. Sponsored by the Iowa Corn Growers Association, the competition includes all head-to-head regular season competitions between the two rival universities in all sports.

=== Football ===
Football first made its way onto the Iowa State campus in 1878 as a recreational sport, but it was not until 1892 that Iowa State organized its first team to represent the school in football. In 1894, college president William M. Beardshear spearheaded the foundation of an athletic association to officially sanction Iowa State football teams. The 1894 team finished with a 6‚Äì1 mark. The Cyclones compete each year for traveling trophies. Since 1977, Iowa State and Iowa compete annually for the Cy-Hawk Trophy. Iowa State competes in an annual rivalry game against Kansas State known as Farmageddon and against former conference foe Missouri for the Telephone Trophy. The Cyclones also compete against the Iowa Hawkeyes, their in-state rival.
The Cyclones play their home games at Jack Trice Stadium, named after Jack Trice, ISU&#x27;s first African-American athlete and also the first and only Iowa State athlete to die from injuries sustained during athletic competition. Trice died three days after his first game playing for Iowa State against Minnesota in Minneapolis on October 6, 1923. Suffering from a broken collarbone early in the game, he continued to play until he was trampled by a group of Minnesota players. It is disputed whether he was trampled purposely or if it was by accident. The stadium was named in his honor in 1997 and is the only NCAA Division I-A stadium named after an African-American. Jack Trice Stadium, formerly known as Cyclone Stadium, opened on September 20, 1975, with a win against the United States Air Force Academy.

=== Men&#x27;s basketball ===
Hopes of &quot;Hilton Magic&quot; returning took a boost with the hiring of ISU alum, Ames native, and fan favorite Fred Hoiberg as coach of the men&#x27;s basketball team in April 2010. Hoiberg (&quot;The Mayor&quot;) played three seasons under legendary coach Johnny Orr and one season under future Chicago Bulls coach Tim Floyd during his standout collegiate career as a Cyclone (1991‚Äì95). Orr laid the foundation of success in men&#x27;s basketball upon his arrival from Michigan in 1980 and is credited with building Hilton Magic. Besides Hoiberg, other Cyclone greats played for Orr and brought winning seasons, including Jeff Grayer, Barry Stevens, and walk-on Jeff Hornacek. The 1985-86 Cyclones were one of the most memorable. Orr coached the team to second place in the Big Eight and produced one of his greatest career wins, a victory over his former team and No. 2 seed Michigan in the second round of the NCAA tournament.

Under coaches Floyd (1995‚Äì98) and Larry Eustachy (1998‚Äì2003), Iowa State achieved even greater success. Floyd took the Cyclones to the Sweet Sixteen in 1997 and Eustachy led ISU to two consecutive Big 12 regular season conference titles in 1999-2000 and 2000‚Äì01, plus the conference tournament title in 2000. Seeded No. 2 in the 2000 NCAA tournament, Eustachy and the Cyclones defeated UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen before falling to Michigan State, the eventual NCAA Champion, in the regional finals by a score of 75‚Äì64 (the differential representing the Spartans&#x27; narrowest margin of victory in the tournament). Standout Marcus Fizer and Jamaal Tinsley were scoring leaders for the Cyclones who finished the season 32‚Äì5. Tinsley returned to lead the Cyclones the following year with another conference title and No. 2 seed, but ISU finished the season with a 25‚Äì6 overall record after a stunning loss to No. 15 seed Hampton in the first round.

In 2011‚Äì12, Hoiberg&#x27;s Cyclones finished third in the Big 12 and returned to the NCAA tournament, dethroning defending national champion Connecticut, 77‚Äì64, in the second round before losing in the Round of 32 to top-seeded Kentucky. All-Big 12 First Team selection Royce White led the Cyclones with 38 points and 22 rebounds in the two contests, ending the season at 23‚Äì11.

The 2013-14 campaign turned out to be another highly successful season. Iowa State went 28‚Äì8, won the Big 12 Tournament, and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by beating North Carolina in the second round of the NCAA tournament. The Cyclones finished 11‚Äì7 in Big 12 play, finishing in a tie for third in the league standings, and beat a school-record nine teams (9‚Äì3) that were ranked in the Associated Press top 25. The Cyclones opened the season 14‚Äì0, breaking the school record for consecutive wins. Melvin Ejim was named the Big 12 Player of the Year and an All-American by five organizations. Deandre Kane was named the Big 12 Tournament&#x27;s most valuable player.

On June 8, 2015, Steve Prohm took over as head basketball coach replacing Hoiberg who left to take the head coaching position with the Chicago Bulls. In his first season with the Cyclones, Prohm secured a #4 seed in the Midwest region where the Cyclones advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before falling to top-seeded Virginia, 84‚Äì71. In 2017, Iowa State stunned 3rd ranked Kansas, 92‚Äì89, in overtime, snapping KU&#x27;s 54-game home winning streak, before winning the 2017 Big 12 men&#x27;s basketball tournament, its third conference championship in four years, defeating West Virginia in the final.

Of Iowa State&#x27;s 19 NCAA tournament appearances, the Cyclones have reached the Sweet Sixteen eight times (1944, 1986, 1997, 2000, 2014, 2016, 2022, 2024), made two appearances in the Elite Eight (1944, 2000), and reached the Final Four once in 1944.

=== Women&#x27;s basketball ===

Iowa State is known for having one of the most successful women&#x27;s basketball programs in the nation. Since the founding of the Big 12, Coach Bill Fennelly and the Cyclones have won three conference titles (one regular season, two tournament), and have advanced to the Sweet Sixteen five times (1999‚Äì2001, 2009, 2010) and the Elite Eight twice (1999, 2009) in the NCAA tournament. The team has one of the largest fan bases in the nation with attendance figures ranked third in the nation in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2016, 2017, and 2020 and second in the nation in 2013, 2014, 2018 and 2022.

=== Volleyball ===
Coach Christy Johnson-Lynch led the 2012 Cyclones team to a fifth straight 20-win season and fifth NCAA regional semifinal appearance in six seasons, and leading Iowa State to a 22‚Äì8 (13‚Äì3 Big 12) overall record and second-place finish in the conference. The Cyclones finished the season with seven wins over top-25 teams, including a victory over No. 1 Nebraska Cornhuskers in Iowa State&#x27;s first-ever win over a top-ranked opponent in addition to providing the only Big 12 Conference loss to the 2012 conference and NCAA champion Texas Longhorns.

In 2011, Iowa State finished the season 25‚Äì6 (13‚Äì3 Big 12), placing second in the league, as well as a final national ranking of eighth. 2011 is only the second season in which an Iowa State volleyball team has ever recorded 25 wins. The Cyclones beat No. 9 Florida during the season in Gainesville, its sixth win over a top-10 team in Cyclone history. In 2009, Iowa State finished the season second in the Big 12 behind Texas with a 27‚Äì5 record and ranked No. 6, its highest ever national finish.

Johnson-Lynch is the fastest Iowa State coach to clinch 100 victories. In 2011, she became the school&#x27;s winningest volleyball coach when her team defeated the Texas Tech Red Raiders, her 136th coaching victory, in straight sets.

=== Wrestling ===

The ISU wrestling program has captured the NCAA wrestling tournament title eight times between 1928 and 1987, and won the Big 12 Conference Tournament three consecutive years, 2007‚Äì2009. On February 7, 2010, the Cyclones became the first collegiate wrestling program to record its 1,000th dual win in program history by defeating the Arizona State Sun Devils, 30‚Äì10, in Tempe, Arizona.

In 2002, under former NCAA champion &amp; Olympian Coach Bobby Douglas, Iowa State became the first school to produce a four-time, undefeated NCAA Division I champion, Cael Sanderson (considered by the majority of the wrestling community to be the best college wrestler ever), who also took the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. Dan Gable, another legendary ISU wrestler, is famous for having lost only one match in his entire Iowa State collegiate career - his last - and winning gold at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, while not giving up a single point.

In 2013, Iowa State hosted its eighth NCAA Wrestling Championships. The Cyclones hosted the first NCAA championships in 1928.

In February 2017, former Virginia Tech coach and 2016 NWCA Coach of the Year Kevin Dresser was introduced as the new Cyclone wrestling coach, replacing Kevin Jackson.

<doc id="14878" wikidata="Q6867" url="?curid=14878" title="International Astronomical Union">
<text>The International Astronomical Union (IAU; , UAI) is an international non-governmental organization (INGO) with the objective of advancing astronomy in all aspects, including promoting astronomical research, outreach, education, and development through global cooperation. It was founded on 28 July 1919 in Brussels, Belgium and is based in Paris, France.

The IAU is composed of individual members, who include both professional astronomers and junior scientists, and national members, such as professional associations, national societies, or academic institutions. Individual members are organised into divisions, committees, and working groups centered on particular subdisciplines, subjects, or initiatives. the Union had 85 national members and 12,734 individual members, spanning 90 countries and territories.

Among the key activities of the IAU is serving as a forum for scientific conferences. It sponsors nine annual symposia and holds a triannual General Assembly that sets policy and includes various scientific meetings. The Union is best known for being the leading authority in assigning official names and designations to astronomical objects, and for setting uniform definitions for astronomical principles. It also coordinates with national and international partners, such as UNESCO, to fulfill its mission.

The IAU is a member of the International Science Council, which is composed of international scholarly and scientific institutions and national academies of sciences.

==Function==
The International Astronomical Union is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the recognized authority for assigning designations and names to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them.

The IAU is a member of the International Science Council. Its main objective is to promote and safeguard the science of astronomy in all its aspects through international cooperation. The IAU maintains friendly relations with organizations that include amateur astronomers in their membership. The IAU has its head office on the second floor of the in the 14th arrondissement of Paris.

This organisation has many working groups. For example, the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN), which maintains the astronomical naming conventions and planetary nomenclature for planetary bodies, and the Working Group on Star Names (WGSN), which catalogues and standardizes proper names for stars. The IAU is also responsible for the system of astronomical telegrams which are produced and distributed on its behalf by the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. The Minor Planet Center also operates under the IAU, and is a &quot;clearinghouse&quot; for all non-planetary or non-moon bodies in the Solar System.

== History ==
The IAU was founded on 28 July 1919, at the Constitutive Assembly of the International Research Council (now the International Science Council) held in Brussels, Belgium. Two subsidiaries of the IAU were also created at this assembly: the &quot;International Time Commission&quot; seated at the International Time Bureau in Paris, France, and the &quot;International Central Bureau of Astronomical Telegrams&quot; initially seated in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The seven initial member states were Belgium, Canada, France, Great Britain, Greece, Japan, and the United States, soon to be followed by Italy and Mexico. The first executive committee consisted of Benjamin Baillaud (President, France), Alfred Fowler (General Secretary, UK), and four vice presidents: William Campbell (US), Frank Dyson (UK), Georges Lecointe (Belgium), and Annibale Ricc√≤ (Italy). Thirty-two Commissions (referred to initially as Standing Committees) were appointed at the Brussels meeting and focused on topics ranging from relativity to minor planets. The reports of these 32 Commissions formed the main substance of the first General Assembly, which took place in Rome, Italy, 2‚Äì10 May 1922.

By the end of the first General Assembly, ten additional nations (Australia, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, South Africa, and Spain) had joined the Union, bringing the total membership to 19 countries. Although the Union was officially formed eight months after the end of World War I, international collaboration in astronomy had been strong in the pre-war era (e.g., the &quot;Astronomische Gesellschaft Katalog&quot; projects since 1868, the Astrographic Catalogue since 1887, and the International Union for Solar research since 1904).

The first 50 years of the Union&#x27;s history are well documented. Subsequent history is recorded in the form of reminiscences of past IAU Presidents and General Secretaries. Twelve of the fourteen past General Secretaries in the period 1964‚Äì2006 contributed their recollections of the Union&#x27;s history in IAU Information Bulletin No. 100. Six past IAU Presidents in the period 1976‚Äì2003 also contributed their recollections in IAU Information Bulletin No. 104.

In 2015 and 2019, the Union held the NameExoWorlds contests.

Starting in 2024, the Union, in partnership with the United Nations, is poised to play a critical role in developing the legislation and framework for lunar industrialization.

== Composition ==
As of 1 August 2019, the IAU has a total of 13,701 &quot;individual members&quot;, who are professional astronomers from 102 countries worldwide; 81.7% of individual members are male, while 18.3% are female.

Membership also includes 82 &quot;national members&quot;, professional astronomical communities representing their country&#x27;s affiliation with the IAU. National members include the Australian Academy of Science, the Chinese Astronomical Society, the French Academy of Sciences, the Indian National Science Academy, the National Academies (United States), the National Research Foundation of South Africa, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (Argentina), the Council of German Observatories, the Royal Astronomical Society (United Kingdom), the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Science Council of Japan, among many others.

The sovereign body of the IAU is its &quot;General Assembly&quot;, which comprises all members. The Assembly determines IAU policy, approves the Statutes and By-Laws of the Union (and amendments proposed thereto) and elects various committees.

The right to vote on matters brought before the Assembly varies according to the type of business under discussion. The Statutes consider such business to be divided into two categories:
* issues of a &quot;primarily scientific nature&quot; (as determined by the Executive Committee), upon which voting is restricted to individual members, and
* all other matters (such as Statute revision and procedural questions), upon which voting is restricted to the representatives of national members.

On budget matters (which fall into the second category), votes are weighted according to the relative subscription levels of the national members. A second category vote requires a turnout of at least two-thirds of national members to be valid. An absolute majority is sufficient for approval in any vote, except for Statute revision which requires a two-thirds majority. An equality of votes is resolved by the vote of the President of the Union.

== General Assemblies ==
Since 1922, the IAU General Assembly meets every three years, except for the period between 1938 and 1948, due to World War II.
After a Polish request in 1967, and by a controversial decision of the then President of the IAU, an &quot;Extraordinary IAU General Assembly&quot; was held in September 1973 in Warsaw, Poland, to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the birth of Nicolaus Copernicus, soon after the regular 1973 GA had been held in Sydney.

== Commission 46: Education in astronomy ==
Commission 46 is a Committee of the Executive Committee of the IAU, playing a special role in the discussion of astronomy development with governments and scientific academies. The IAU is affiliated with the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), a non-governmental organization representing a global membership that includes both national scientific bodies and international scientific unions. They often encourage countries to become members of the IAU. The Commission further seeks to development, information or improvement of astronomical education. Part of Commission 46, is Teaching Astronomy for Development (TAD) program in countries where there is currently very little astronomical education. Another program is named the Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP), is a project of the International Year of Astronomy 2009, among which Hands-On Universe that will concentrate more resources on education activities for children and schools designed to advance sustainable global development. GTTP is also concerned with the effective use and transfer of astronomy education tools and resources into classroom science curricula. A strategic plan for the period 2010‚Äì2020 has been published.

== Publications ==
In 2004 the IAU contracted with the Cambridge University Press to publish the &quot;Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union&quot;.

In 2007, the Communicating Astronomy with the Public Journal Working Group prepared a study assessing the feasibility of the &quot;Communicating Astronomy with the Public Journal&quot; (&quot;CAP Journal&quot;).

<doc id="14880" wikidata="Q47488" url="?curid=14880" title="International Criminal Court">
<text>The International Criminal Court (ICC) is an intergovernmental organization and international tribunal seated in The Hague, Netherlands. It is the first and only permanent international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. The ICC is distinct from the International Court of Justice, an organ of the United Nations that hears disputes between states. Established in 2002 pursuant to the multilateral Rome Statute, the ICC is considered by its proponents to be a major step toward justice, and an innovation in international law and human rights.

The Court has faced a number of criticisms. Some governments have refused to recognize the court&#x27;s assertion of jurisdiction, with other civil groups also accusing the court of bias, Eurocentrism and racism. Others have also questioned the effectiveness of the court as a means of upholding international law.

== History ==
=== Background ===
The establishment of an international tribunal to judge political leaders accused of international crimes was first proposed during the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 following the First World War by the Commission of Responsibilities. The issue was addressed again at a conference held in Geneva under the auspices of the League of Nations in 1937, which resulted in the conclusion of the first convention stipulating the establishment of a permanent international court to try acts of international terrorism. The convention was signed by 13 states, but none ratified it and the convention never entered into force.

Following the Second World War, the allied powers established two &quot;ad hoc&quot; tribunals to prosecute Axis leaders accused of war crimes. The International Military Tribunal, which sat in Nuremberg, prosecuted German leaders while the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo prosecuted Japanese leaders. In 1948 the United Nations General Assembly first recognized the need for a permanent international court to deal with atrocities of the kind prosecuted after World War II. At the request of the General Assembly, the International Law Commission (ILC) drafted two statutes by the early 1950s but these were shelved during the Cold War, which made the establishment of an international criminal court politically unrealistic.

Benjamin B. Ferencz, an investigator of Nazi war crimes after World War II and the Chief Prosecutor for the United States Army at the Einsatzgruppen trial, became a vocal advocate of the establishment of international rule of law and of an international criminal court. In his book &quot;Defining International Aggression: The Search for World Peace&quot; (1975), he advocated for the establishment of such a court. Another leading proponent was Robert Kurt Woetzel, a German-born professor of international law, who co-edited &quot;Toward a Feasible International Criminal Court&quot; in 1970 and created the Foundation for the Establishment of an International Criminal Court in 1971.

=== Formal proposal and establishment ===
In June 1989, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, A. N. R. Robinson, revived the idea of a permanent international criminal court by proposing the creation of tribunal to address the illegal drug trade. In response, the General Assembly tasked the ILC with once again drafting a statute for a permanent court.

While work began on the draft, the UN Security Council established two &quot;ad hoc&quot; tribunals in the early 1990s: The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, created in 1993 in response to large-scale atrocities committed by armed forces during the Yugoslav Wars, and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, created in 1994 following the Rwandan genocide. The creation of these tribunals further highlighted to many the need for a permanent international criminal court.

In 1994, the ILC presented its final draft statute for the International Criminal Court to the General Assembly and recommended that a conference be convened to negotiate a treaty that would serve as the Court&#x27;s statute.

To consider major substantive issues in the draft statute, the General Assembly established the Ad Hoc Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court, which met twice in 1995. After considering the Committee&#x27;s report, the General Assembly created the Preparatory Committee on the Establishment of the ICC to prepare a consolidated draft text.

From 1996 to 1998, six sessions of the Preparatory Committee were held at the United Nations headquarters in New York City, during which NGOs provided input and attended meetings under the umbrella organisation of the Coalition for the International Criminal Court (CICC). In January 1998, the Bureau and coordinators of the Preparatory Committee convened for an Inter-Sessional meeting in Zutphen in the Netherlands to technically consolidate and restructure the draft articles into a draft.

Finally, the General Assembly convened a conference in Rome in June 1998, with the aim of finalizing the treaty to serve as the Court&#x27;s statute. On 17 July 1998, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court was adopted by a vote of 120 to seven, with 21 countries abstaining. The seven countries that voted against the treaty were China, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Qatar, the U.S., and Yemen.

Israel&#x27;s opposition to the treaty stemmed from the inclusion in the list of war crimes &quot;the action of transferring population into occupied territory&quot;, a provision added during the Rome Conference at the insistence of Arab countries with the specific intention of targeting Israeli citizens.

The UN General Assembly voted on 9 December 1999 and again on 12 December 2000 to endorse the ICC.

Following 60 ratifications, the Rome Statute entered into force on 1 July 2002 and the International Criminal Court was formally established.

The first bench of 18 judges was elected by the Assembly of States Parties in February 2003. They were sworn in at the inaugural session of the Court on 11 March 2003.

The Court issued its first arrest warrants on 8 July 2005, and the first pre-trial hearings were held in 2006.

The Court issued its first judgment in 2012 when it found Congolese rebel leader Thomas Lubanga Dyilo guilty of war crimes related to using child soldiers. Lubanga was sentenced to 14 years in prison.

In 2010, the states parties of the Rome Statute held the first Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in Kampala, Uganda. The Review Conference led to the adoption of two resolutions that amended the crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court. Resolution 5 amended Article 8 on war crimes, criminalizing the use of certain kinds of weapons in non-international conflicts whose use was already forbidden in international conflicts. Resolution 6, pursuant to Article 5(2) of the Statute, provided the definition and a procedure for jurisdiction over the crime of aggression.

==Organization==
The ICC has four principal organs: the Presidency, the Judicial Divisions, the Office of the Prosecutor and the Registry.
* The President is the most senior judge chosen by the eighteen judges in the Judicial Division.
* The Judicial Division is composed of eighteen judges and hears cases before the Court.
* The Office of the Prosecutor is headed by the Prosecutor, who investigates crimes and initiates criminal proceedings before the Judicial Division.
* The Registry is headed by the Registrar and is charged with managing all the administrative functions of the ICC, including the headquarters, detention unit, and public defense office.

The ICC employs over 900 personnel from roughly 100 countries and conducts proceedings in English and French.

==Operation==
The ICC began operations on 1 July 2002, upon the entry into force of the Rome Statute, a multilateral treaty that serves as the court&#x27;s charter and governing document. States which become party to the Rome Statute become members of the ICC, serving on the Assembly of States Parties, which administers the court. As of January 2025, there are 125 ICC member states, 29 states have signed but not ratified the Rome Statute (including four who have withdrawn their signature) and 41 states have neither signed nor become parties to the Rome Statute.

Intended to serve as the &quot;court of last resort&quot;, the ICC complements existing national judicial systems and may exercise its jurisdiction only when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals. It lacks universal territorial jurisdiction and may only investigate and prosecute crimes committed within member states, crimes committed by nationals of member states, or crimes in situations referred to the Court by the United Nations Security Council.
The ICC held its first hearing in 2006, concerning war crimes charges against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, a Congolese warlord accused of recruiting child soldiers; his subsequent conviction in 2012 was the first in the court&#x27;s history. The Office of the Prosecutor has opened twelve official investigations and is conducting an additional nine preliminary examinations.

Dozens of individuals have been indicted in the ICC, including Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony, former President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, Libyan head of state Muammar Gaddafi, President Laurent Gbagbo of Ivory Coast and former Vice President Jean-Pierre Bemba of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

On 17 March 2023, ICC judges issued arrest warrants for Russian president Vladimir Putin and the Presidential Commissioner for Children&#x27;s Rights in Russia Maria Lvova-Belova for child abductions in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia denounced the arrest warrants as &quot;outrageous&quot;. Putin became the first head of state of a U.N. Security Council Permanent Member to be the subject of an ICC arrest warrant. Although Russia withdrew its signature from the Rome Statute in 2016, and is thus not a participant in the ICC nor under its jurisdiction, Putin can be charged for actions against Ukraine, which is not a party but has accepted jurisdiction of the court since 2014. Should Putin travel to a state party, he can be arrested by local authorities. Later in 2023, Russia&#x27;s Ministry of Internal Affairs retaliated by placing several ICC officials on its wanted list. In March 2024, the ICC issued two more arrest warrants, for Sergey Kobylash, the commander of the Long-Range Aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces, and Viktor Sokolov, the commander of the Black Sea Fleet over their role in war crimes in Ukraine.

On 20 May 2024, the ICC&#x27;s Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan announced his intention to seek arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, leader of Hamas Yahya Sinwar, leader of the Al Qassem Brigades Mohammed Deif, and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in connection to war crimes committed in the Israel-Hamas war. On November 21, warrants were formally issued for Netanyahu, Gallant and Deif. Warrants for Haniyeh and Sinwar were withdrawn following confirmation of their deaths in July and October respectively.

On 23 January 2025, the ICC&#x27;s Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan announced requests for arrest warrants against Taliban leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and the Chief Justice of Afghanistan Abdul Hakim Haqqani, for crimes against humanity of the oppression and persecution of Afghan women and girls, who have been deprived of the freedom of movement, the rights to control their bodies, to education, and to a private and family life. Alleged resistance and opposition are brutally suppressed with murder, imprisonment, torture, rape, and other forms of sexual violence, since 2021.

=== Establishing the court&#x27;s jurisdiction ===
The process to establish the court&#x27;s jurisdiction may be &quot;triggered&quot; by any one of three possible sources: (1) a state party, (2) the Security Council or (3) a prosecutor. It is then up to the prosecutor acting &quot;proprio motu&quot; to initiate an investigation under the requirements of Article 15 of the Rome Statute. The procedure is slightly different when referred by a state party or the Security Council, in which cases the prosecutor does not need authorization of the Pre-Trial Chamber to initiate the investigation. Where there is a reasonable basis to proceed, it is mandatory for the prosecutor to initiate an investigation. The factors listed in Article 53 considered for reasonable basis include whether the case would be admissible, and whether there are substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice (the latter stipulates balancing against the gravity of the crime and the interests of the victims).

==Structure==

The ICC is governed by the Assembly of States Parties, which is made up of the states that are party to the Rome Statute. The Assembly elects officials of the Court, approves its budget, and adopts amendments to the Rome Statute. The Court itself has four organs: the Presidency, the Judicial Divisions, the Office of the Prosecutor, and the Registry.

===State parties===

====Assembly====
The Court&#x27;s management oversight and legislative body, the Assembly of States Parties, consists of one representative from each state party. Each state party has one vote and &quot;every effort&quot; has to be made to reach decisions by consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, decisions are made by vote. The Assembly is presided over by a president and two vice-presidents, who are elected by the members to three-year terms.

The Assembly meets in full session once a year, alternating between New York and The Hague, and may also hold special sessions where circumstances require. Sessions are open to observer states and non-governmental organizations.

The Assembly elects the judges and prosecutors, decides the Court&#x27;s budget, adopts important texts (such as the Rules of Procedure and Evidence), and provides management oversight to the other organs of the Court. Article 46 of the Rome Statute allows the Assembly to remove from office a judge or prosecutor who &quot;is found to have committed serious misconduct or a serious breach of his or her duties&quot; or &quot;is unable to exercise the functions required by this Statute&quot;.

The states parties cannot interfere with the judicial functions of the Court. Disputes concerning individual cases are settled by the Judicial Divisions.

In 2010, Kampala, Uganda hosted the Assembly&#x27;s Rome Statute Review Conference.

=== Organs ===
The Court has four organs: the Presidency, the Judicial Division, the Office of the Prosecutor, and the Registry.

====Presidency====

The Presidency is responsible for the proper administration of the Court (apart from the Office of the Prosecutor). It comprises the President and the First and Second Vice-Presidents‚Äîthree judges of the Court who are elected to the Presidency by their fellow judges for a maximum of two three-year terms.

As of March 2024, the President is Tomoko Akane from Japan, who took office on 11 March 2024, succeeding Piotr Hofma≈Ñski. Her first term will expire in 2027.

====Judicial Division====

The Judicial Divisions consist of the 18 judges of the Court, organized into three chambers‚Äîthe Pre-Trial Chamber, Trial Chamber and Appeals Chamber ‚Äî which carry out the judicial functions of the Court. Judges are elected to the Court by the Assembly of States Parties. They serve nine-year terms and are not generally eligible for re-election. All judges must be nationals of states parties to the Rome Statute, and no two judges may be nationals of the same state. They must be &quot;persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity who possess the qualifications required in their respective States for appointment to the highest judicial offices&quot;.

The Prosecutor or any person being investigated or prosecuted may request the disqualification of a judge from &quot;any case in which his or her impartiality might reasonably be doubted on any ground&quot;. Any request for the disqualification of a judge from a particular case is decided by an absolute majority of the other judges. Judges may be removed from office if &quot;found to have committed serious misconduct or a serious breach of his or her duties&quot; or is unable to exercise his or her functions. The removal of a judge requires both a two-thirds majority of the other judges and a two-thirds majority of the states parties.

====Office of the Prosecutor====
The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) is responsible for conducting investigations and prosecutions. It is headed by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, who is assisted by one or more Deputy Prosecutors. The Rome Statute provides that the Office of the Prosecutor shall act independently; as such, no member of the Office may seek or act on instructions from any external source, such as states, international organisations, non-governmental organisations or individuals.

The Prosecutor may open an investigation under three circumstances:
* when a situation is referred by a state party;
* when a situation is referred by the United Nations Security Council, acting to address a threat to international peace and security; or
* when the Pre-Trial Chamber authorises the prosecutor to open an investigation on the basis of information received from other sources, such as individuals or non-governmental organisations.

Any person being investigated or prosecuted may request the disqualification of a prosecutor from any case &quot;in which their impartiality might reasonably be doubted on any ground&quot;. Requests for the disqualification of prosecutors are decided by the Appeals Chamber. A prosecutor may be removed from office by an absolute majority of the states parties through a finding &quot;to have committed serious misconduct or a serious breach of his or her duties&quot; or is unable to exercise his or her functions. One critic said there are &quot;insufficient checks and balances on the authority of the ICC prosecutor and judges&quot; and &quot;insufficient protection against politicized prosecutions or other abuses&quot;. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief ICC prosecutor, stressed in 2011 the importance of politics in prosecutions: &quot;You cannot say al-Bashir is in London, arrest him. You need a political agreement.&quot; Henry Kissinger says the checks and balances are so weak that the prosecutor &quot;has virtually unlimited discretion in practice&quot;.

Lead prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo of Argentina, in office from 2003 to 2012, was succeeded in the role by Fatou Bensouda of Gambia, who served from 16 June 2012 to 16 June 2021 (she was elected to the nine-year term on 12 December 2011).

On 12 February 2021, British barrister Karim Khan was selected in a secret ballot against three other candidates to serve as lead prosecutor as of 16 June 2021. As British barrister, Khan had headed the United Nations&#x27; special investigative team when it looked into Islamic State crimes in Iraq. At the ICC, he had been lead defense counsel on cases from Kenya, Sudan and Libya.

=====Policy Paper=====
A Policy Paper is a document occasionally published by the Office of the Prosecutor which puts forth the considerations given to the topics the office focuses on, and often the criteria for case selection. While a policy paper does not give the Court jurisdiction over a new category of crimes, it promises what the Office of Prosecutor will consider when selecting cases in the upcoming term of service. OTP&#x27;s policy papers are subject to revision.

The five following Policy Papers have been published since the start of the ICC:
* 1 September 2007: Policy Paper on the Interest of Justice
* 12 April 2010: Policy Paper on Victims&#x27; Participation
* 1 November 2013: Policy Paper on Preliminary Examinations
* 20 June 2014: Policy Paper on Sexual and Gender-Based Crimes
* 15 September 2016: Policy paper on case selection and prioritisation
* 15 November 2016: Policy on Children

======Environmental crimes======
The Policy Paper published in September 2016 announced that the ICC will focus on environmental crimes when selecting the cases. According to this document, the Office will give particular consideration to prosecuting Rome Statute crimes that are committed by means of, or that result in, &quot;inter alia, the destruction of the environment, the illegal exploitation of natural resources or the illegal dispossession of land&quot;.

This has been interpreted as a major shift in environmental law and a move with significant effects.

====Registry====
The Registry is responsible for the non-judicial aspects of the administration and servicing of the Court. This includes, among other things, &quot;the administration of legal aid matters, court management, victims and witnesses matters, defence counsel, detention unit, and the traditional services provided by administrations in international organisations, such as finance, translation, building management, procurement and personnel&quot;. The Registry is headed by the Registrar, who is elected by the judges to a five-year term. As of April 2023 the Registrar is Osvaldo Zavala Giler.

== Crimes for which individuals can be prosecuted ==
The Court&#x27;s subject-matter jurisdiction means the crimes for which individuals can be prosecuted. Individuals can only be prosecuted for crimes that are listed in the Statute. The primary crimes are listed in article 5 of the Statute and defined in later articles: genocide (defined in article 6), crimes against humanity (defined in article 7), war crimes (defined in article 8), and crimes of aggression (defined in article 8 &quot;bis&quot;) (since 2018). In addition, article 70 defines &quot;offences against the administration of justice&quot;, which is a fifth category of crime for which individuals can be prosecuted.

=== Genocide ===
Article 6 defines the crime of genocide as &quot;acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.&quot; There are five such acts which constitute crimes of genocide under article 6:
# Killing members of a group
# Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group
# Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction
# Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group
# Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group
The definition of these crimes is identical to those contained within the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948.

=== Crimes against humanity ===
Article 7 defines crimes against humanity as acts &quot;committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack&quot;. The article lists 16 such as individual crimes:

# Murder
# Extermination
# Enslavement
# Deportation or forcible transfer of population
# Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty
# Torture
# Rape
# Sexual slavery
# Enforced prostitution
# Forced pregnancy
# Enforced sterilization
# Sexual violence
# Persecution
# Enforced disappearance of persons
# Apartheid
# Other inhumane acts

=== War crimes ===
Article 8 defines war crimes depending on whether an armed conflict is either international (which generally means it is fought between states) or non-international (which generally means that it is fought between non-state actors, such as rebel groups, or between a state and such non-state actors). The most serious crimes constitute either grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and its Protocols. In total there are 74 war crimes listed in article 8.

Eleven crimes constitute grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and apply only to international armed conflicts:
# Willful killing
# Torture
# Inhumane treatment
# Biological experiments
# Willfully causing great suffering
# Destruction and appropriation of property
# Compelling service in hostile forces
# Denying a fair trial
# Unlawful deportation and transfer
# Unlawful confinement
# Taking hostages

Seven crimes constitute serious violations of article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions and apply only to non-international armed conflicts:
# Murder
# Mutilation
# Cruel treatment
# Torture
# Outrages upon personal dignity
# Taking hostages
# Sentencing or execution without due process

Another 56 crimes defined by article 8: 35 apply to international armed conflicts and 21 to non-international armed conflicts. Such crimes include attacking civilians or civilian objects, attacking peacekeepers, causing excessive incidental death or damage, transferring populations into occupied territories, treacherously killing or wounding, denying quarter, pillaging, employing poison, using expanding bullets, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and conscripting or using child soldiers.

=== Crimes of aggression ===
Article 8 &quot;bis&quot; defines crimes of aggression. The Statute originally provided that the Court could not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until such time as the states parties agreed on a definition of the crime and set out the conditions under which it could be prosecuted. Such an amendment was adopted at the first review conference of the ICC in Kampala, Uganda, in June 2010. This amendment specified that the ICC would not be allowed to exercise jurisdiction of the crime of aggression until two further conditions had been satisfied: (1) the amendment has entered into force for 30 states parties and (2) on or after 1 January 2017, the Assembly of States Parties has voted in favor of allowing the Court to exercise jurisdiction. On 26 June 2016 the first condition was satisfied and the state parties voted in favor of allowing the Court to exercise jurisdiction on 14 December 2017. The Court&#x27;s jurisdiction to prosecute crimes of aggression was accordingly activated on 17 July 2018.

The Statute, as amended, defines the crime of aggression as &quot;the planning, preparation, initiation or execution, by a person in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State, of an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations.&quot; The Statute defines an &quot;act of aggression&quot; as &quot;the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations.&quot; The article also contains a list of seven acts of aggression, which are identical to those in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 of 1974 and include the following acts when committed by one state against another state:

# Invasion or attack by armed forces against territory
# Military occupation of territory
# Annexation of territory
# Bombardment against territory
# Use of any weapons against territory
# Blockade of ports or coasts
# Attack on the land, sea, or air forces or marine and air fleets
# The use of armed forces which are within the territory of another state by agreement, but in contravention of the conditions of the agreement
# Allowing territory to be used by another state to perpetrate an act of aggression against a third state

=== Offences against the administration of justice ===
Article 70 criminalizes certain intentional acts which interfere with investigations and proceedings before the Court, including giving false testimony, presenting false evidence, corruptly influencing a witness or official of the Court, retaliating against an official of the Court, and soliciting or accepting bribes as an official of the Court.

== Jurisdiction and admissibility ==

The Rome Statute requires that several criteria exist in a particular case before an individual can be prosecuted by the Court. The Statute contains three jurisdictional requirements and three admissibility requirements. All criteria must be met for a case to proceed. The three jurisdictional requirements are (1) subject-matter jurisdiction (what acts constitute crimes), (2) territorial or personal jurisdiction (where the crimes were committed or who committed them), and (3) temporal jurisdiction (when the crimes were committed).

For an individual to be prosecuted by the Court either territorial jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction must exist. Therefore, an individual can only be prosecuted if he or she has either (1) committed a crime within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court or (2) committed a crime while being a national of a state that is within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court.

=== Territorial jurisdiction ===
The territorial jurisdiction of the Court includes the territory, registered vessels, and registered aircraft of states which have either (1) become party to the Rome Statute or (2) accepted the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction by filing a declaration with the Court.

In situations that are referred to the Court by the United Nations Security Council, the territorial jurisdiction is defined by the Security Council, which may be more expansive than the Court&#x27;s normal territorial jurisdiction. For example, if the Security Council refers a situation that took place in the territory of a state that has both not become party to the Rome Statute and not lodged a declaration with the Court, the Court will still be able to prosecute crimes that occurred within that state.

=== Personal jurisdiction ===
The personal jurisdiction of the Court extends to all natural persons who commit crimes, regardless of where they are located or where the crimes were committed, as long as those individuals are nationals of either (1) states that are party to the Rome Statute or (2) states that have accepted the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction by filing a declaration with the Court. As with territorial jurisdiction, the personal jurisdiction can be expanded by the Security Council if it refers a situation to the Court.

=== Temporal jurisdiction requirements ===

Temporal jurisdiction is the time period over which the Court can exercise its powers. No statute of limitations applies to any of the crimes defined in the Statute. This is not completely retroactive. Individuals can only be prosecuted for crimes that took place on or after 1 July 2002, which is the date that the Rome Statute entered into force. If a state became party to the Statute, and therefore a member of the Court, after 1 July 2002, then the Court cannot exercise jurisdiction prior to the membership date for certain cases. For example, if the Statute entered into force for a state on 1 January 2003, the Court could only exercise temporal jurisdiction over crimes that took place in that state or were committed by a national of that state on or after 1 January 2003.

=== Admissibility requirements ===
To initiate an investigation, the Prosecutor must (1) have a &quot;reasonable basis to believe that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been or is being committed&quot;, (2) the investigation would be consistent with the principle of complementarity, and (3) the investigation serves the interests of justice.

==== Complementarity ====
The principle of complementarity means the Court will only prosecute an individual if states are unwilling or unable to prosecute. Therefore, if legitimate national investigations or proceedings into crimes have taken place or are ongoing, the Court will not initiate proceedings. This principle applies regardless of the outcome of national proceedings. Even if an investigation is closed without any criminal charges being filed or if an accused person is acquitted by a national court, the Court will not prosecute an individual for the crime in question so long as it is satisfied that the national proceedings were legitimate. The application of the complementarity principle has recently come under theoretical scrutiny.

==== Gravity ====
The Court will only initiate proceedings if a crime is of &quot;sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court&quot;.

==== Interests of justice ====
The Prosecutor will initiate an investigation unless there are &quot;substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice&quot; when &quot;[t]aking into account the gravity of the crime and the interests of victims&quot;. Furthermore, even if an investigation has been initiated and there are substantial facts to warrant a prosecution and no other admissibility issues, the Prosecutor must determine whether a prosecution would serve the interests of justice &quot;taking into account all the circumstances, including the gravity of the crime, the interests of victims and the age or infirmity of the alleged perpetrator, and his or her role in the alleged crime&quot;.

== Individual criminal responsibility ==
The Court has jurisdiction over natural persons. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court is individually responsible and liable for punishment in accordance with the Rome Statute. In accordance with the Rome Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person: Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person, regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible; Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted; For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission; In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group of persons acting with a common purpose. In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide; Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person&#x27;s intentions

==Procedure==
===Trial===
Trials are conducted under a hybrid common law and civil law judicial system, but it has been argued the procedural orientation and character of the court is still evolving. A majority of the three judges present, as triers of fact in a bench trial, may reach a decision, which must include a full and reasoned statement. Trials are supposed to be public, but proceedings are often closed, and such exceptions to a public trial have not been enumerated in detail. &quot;In camera&quot; proceedings are allowed for protection of witnesses or defendants as well as for confidential or sensitive evidence. Hearsay and other indirect evidence is not generally prohibited, but it has been argued the court is guided by hearsay exceptions which are prominent in common law systems. There is no subpoena or other means to compel witnesses to come before the court, although the court has some power to compel testimony of those who chose to come before it, such as fines.

===Rights of the accused===
The Rome Statute provides that all persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt, and establishes certain rights of the accused and persons during investigations. These include the right to be fully informed of the charges against them; the right to have a lawyer appointed, free of charge; the right to a speedy trial; and the right to examine the witnesses against them.

To ensure &quot;equality of arms&quot; between defence and prosecution teams, the ICC has established an independent Office of Public Counsel for the Defence (OPCD) to provide logistical support, advice and information to defendants and their counsel. The OPCD also helps to safeguard the rights of the accused during the initial stages of an investigation. Thomas Lubanga&#x27;s defence team said they were given a smaller budget than the Prosecutor and that evidence and witness statements were slow to arrive.

===Victim participation===
One of the great innovations of the Statute of the International Criminal Court and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence is the series of rights granted to victims. For the first time in the history of international criminal justice, victims have the possibility under the Statute to present their views and observations before the Court.

Participation before the Court may occur at various stages of proceedings and may take different forms, although it will be up to the judges to give directions as to the timing and manner of participation.

Participation in the Court&#x27;s proceedings will in most cases take place through a legal representative and will be conducted &quot;in a manner which is not prejudicial or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial trial&quot;.

The victim-based provisions within the Rome Statute provide victims with the opportunity to have their voices heard and to obtain, where appropriate, some form of reparation for their suffering. It is the aim of this attempted balance between retributive and restorative justice that, it is hoped, will enable the ICC to not only bring criminals to justice but also help the victims themselves obtain some form of justice. Justice for victims before the ICC comprises both procedural and substantive justice, by allowing them to participate and present their views and interests, so that they can help to shape truth, justice and reparations outcomes of the Court.

Article 43(6) establishes a Victims and Witnesses Unit to provide &quot;protective measures and security arrangements, counseling and other appropriate assistance for witnesses, victims who appear before the Court, and others who are at risk on account of testimony given by such witnesses.&quot; Article 68 sets out procedures for the &quot;Protection of the victims and witnesses and their participation in the proceedings.&quot; The Court has also established an Office of Public Counsel for Victims, to provide support and assistance to victims and their legal representatives.

=== Reparations ===
Victims before the International Criminal Court can also claim reparations under Article 75 of the Rome Statute. Reparations can only be claimed when a defendant is convicted and at the discretion of the Court&#x27;s judges. So far the Court has ordered reparations against Thomas Lubanga. Reparations can include compensation, restitution and rehabilitation, but other forms of reparations may be appropriate for individual, collective or community victims. Article 79 of the Rome Statute establishes a Trust Fund to provide assistance before a reparation order to victims in a situation or to support reparations to victims and their families if the convicted person has no money.

===Cooperation by states not party to Rome Statute===
One of the principles of international law is that a treaty does not create either obligations or rights for third states without their consent, and this is also enshrined in the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The cooperation of the non-party states with the ICC is envisioned by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to be of voluntary nature. States not acceded to the Rome Statute might still be subject to an obligation to cooperate with ICC in certain cases. When a case is referred to the ICC by the UN Security Council all UN member states are obliged to cooperate, since its decisions are binding for all of them. Also, there is an obligation to respect and ensure respect for international humanitarian law, which stems from the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I, which reflects the absolute nature of international humanitarian law.

In relation to cooperation in investigation and evidence gathering, it is implied from the Rome Statute that the consent of a non-party state is a prerequisite for ICC Prosecutor to conduct an investigation within its territory, and it seems that it is even more necessary for him to observe any reasonable conditions raised by that state, since such restrictions exist for states party to the Statute. Taking into account the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (which worked with the principle of the primacy, instead of complementarity) in relation to cooperation, some scholars have expressed their pessimism as to the possibility of ICC to obtain cooperation of non-party states. As for the actions that ICC can take toward non-party states that do not cooperate, the Rome Statute stipulates that the Court may inform the Assembly of States Parties or Security Council, when the matter was referred by it, when non-party state refuses to cooperate after it has entered into an &quot;ad hoc&quot; arrangement or an agreement with the Court.

===Amnesty and national reconciliation processes===
It is unclear to what extent the ICC is compatible with reconciliation processes that grant amnesty to human rights abusers as part of agreements to end conflict. Article 16 of the Rome Statute allows the Security Council to prevent the Court from investigating or prosecuting a case, and Article 53 allows the Prosecutor the discretion not to initiate an investigation if he or she believes that &quot;an investigation would not serve the interests of justice&quot;. Former ICC president Philippe Kirsch has said that &quot;some limited amnesties may be compatible&quot; with a country&#x27;s obligations genuinely to investigate or prosecute under the Statute.

It is sometimes argued that amnesties are necessary to allow the peaceful transfer of power from abusive regimes. By denying states the right to offer amnesty to human rights abusers, the International Criminal Court may make it more difficult to negotiate an end to conflict and a transition to democracy. For example, the outstanding arrest warrants for four leaders of the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army are regarded by some as an obstacle to ending the insurgency in Uganda. Czech politician Marek Benda argues that &quot;the ICC as a deterrent will in our view only mean the worst dictators will try to retain power at all costs&quot;. The United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross maintain that granting amnesty to those accused of war crimes and other serious crimes is a violation of international law.

==Facilities==
=== Headquarters ===
The official seat of the Court is in The Hague, Netherlands, but its proceedings may take place anywhere.

The Court moved into its first permanent premises in The Hague, located at Oude Waalsdorperweg 10, on 14 December 2015. Part of The Hague&#x27;s International Zone, which also contains the Peace Palace, Europol, Eurojust, ICTY, OPCW and The Hague World Forum, the court facilities are situated on the site of the &quot;Alexanderkazerne&quot;, a former military barracks, adjacent to the dune landscape on the northern edge of the city. The ICC&#x27;s detention centre is a short distance away.

==== Development ====
The land and financing for the new construction were provided by the Netherlands. In addition, the host state organised and financed the architectural design competition which started at the end of 2008.

Three architects were chosen by an international jury from a total of 171 applicants to enter into further negotiations. The Danish firm Schmidt Hammer Lassen were ultimately selected to design the new premises since its design met all the ICC criteria, such as design quality, sustainability, functionality and costs.

Demolition of the barracks started in November 2011 and was completed in August 2012. In October 2012 the tendering procedure for the General Contractor was completed and the combination Visser &amp; Smit Bouw and Boele &amp; van Eesteren (&quot;Courtys&quot;) was selected.

==== Architecture ====

The building has a compact footprint and consists of six connected building volumes with a garden motif. The tallest volume with a green fa√ßade, placed in the middle of the design, is the Court Tower that accommodates three courtrooms. The rest of the building&#x27;s volumes accommodate the offices of the different organs of the ICC.

==== Provisional headquarters, 2002‚Äì2015 ====

Until late 2015, the ICC was housed in interim premises in The Hague provided by the Netherlands. Formerly belonging to KPN, the provisional headquarters were located at Maanweg 174 in the east-central portion of the city.

=== Detention centre ===

The ICC&#x27;s detention centre accommodates both those convicted by the court and serving sentences as well as those suspects detained pending the outcome of their trial. It comprises twelve cells on the premises of the Scheveningen branch of the Hague Penitentiary Institution, The Hague, close to the ICC&#x27;s headquarters in the Alexanderkazerne.

Suspects held by the former International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia were held in the same prison and shared some facilities, like the fitness room, but had no contact with suspects held by the ICC.

=== Other offices ===
The ICC maintains a liaison office in New York and field offices in places where it conducts its activities. As of 18 October 2007, the Court had field offices in Kampala, Kinshasa, Bunia, Ab√©ch√© and Bangui.

==Finance==

The ICC is financed by contributions from the states parties. The amount payable by each state party is determined using the same method as the United Nations: each state&#x27;s contribution is based on the country&#x27;s capacity to pay, which reflects factors such as a national income and population. The maximum amount a single country can pay in any year is limited to 22% of the Court&#x27;s budget; Japan paid this amount in 2008.

The Court spent ‚Ç¨80.5¬†million in 2007. The Assembly of States Parties approved a budget of ‚Ç¨90.4¬†million for 2008, ‚Ç¨101.2¬†million for 2009, and ‚Ç¨141.6 million for 2017. , the ICC&#x27;s staff consisted of 800 persons from approximately 100 states.

==Trial history==
The Court&#x27;s Pre-Trial Chambers have 

Thomas Lubanga, Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui were tried by the ICC. Lubanga and Katanga were convicted and sentenced to 14 and 12 years imprisonment, respectively, whereas Chui was acquitted.

The judgment of Jean-Pierre Bemba was rendered in March 2016. Bemba was convicted on two counts of crimes against humanity and three counts of war crimes. This marked the first time the ICC convicted someone of sexual violence as they added rape to his conviction. Bemba&#x27;s convictions were overturned by the Court&#x27;s Appeal Chamber in June 2018. The Court refused to compensate Bemba for losses suffered by him during his 10 years of imprisonment. It has been argued that this decision raises important questions about the court&#x27;s present powers.

&quot;Ntaganda&quot; (DR Congo) was convicted to 30 years for crimes against humanity. The &quot;Bemba et al.&quot; case and the &quot;Laurent Gbagbo-Bl√© Goud√©&quot; trial in the C√¥te d&#x27;Ivoire situation ended in acquittals. The &quot;Banda&quot; trial in the situation of Darfur, Sudan, was scheduled to begin in 2014 but the start date was vacated.

Charges against Malian Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi have been confirmed and he was sentenced to nine years in prison. On 25 November 2021, his sentence was commuted to 7 years in prison, and he was released on 18 September 2022. Ugandan Dominic Ongwen has been convicted to a prison sentence of 25 years.

On 6 July 2020, two Uyghur activist groups filed a complaint with the ICC calling for it to investigate PRC officials for crimes against Uyghurs, including allegations of genocide. In December 2020, ICC prosecutors rejected the complaint, stating that the ICC did not have jurisdictional basis to proceed.

On 31 October 2023, the Israeli families of over 34 victims of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, filed an Article 15 communication with the ICC prosecutor&#x27;s office urging an investigation into the killings and abductions, and the ICC confirmed the receipt of the filing. Reporters Without Borders also lodged a complaint regarding the deaths of eight Palestinian journalists in the Gaza Strip during Israel&#x27;s bombardment, as well as an Israeli journalist killed during a surprise attack by Hamas in southern Israel.

Notes

==Relationships==
===United Nations===

Unlike the International Court of Justice, the ICC is legally independent from the United Nations. The Rome Statute grants certain powers to the United Nations Security Council, which limit its functional independence. Article 13 allows the Security Council to refer to the Court situations that would not otherwise fall under the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction (as it did in relation to the situations in Darfur and Libya, which the Court could not otherwise have prosecuted as neither Sudan nor Libya are state parties). Article 16 allows the Security Council to require the Court to defer from investigating a case for a period of twelve months. Such a deferral may be renewed indefinitely by the Security Council. This sort of an arrangement gives the ICC some of the advantages inhering in the organs of the United Nations such as using the enforcement powers of the Security Council, but it also creates a risk of being tainted with the political controversies of the Security Council.

The Court cooperates with the UN in many different areas, including the exchange of information and logistical support. The Court reports to the UN each year on its activities, and some meetings of the Assembly of States Parties are held at UN facilities. The relationship between the Court and the UN is governed by a &quot;Relationship Agreement between the International Criminal Court and the United Nations&quot;.

===Nongovernmental organizations===
During the 1970s and 1980s, international human rights and humanitarian Nongovernmental Organizations (or NGOs) began to proliferate at exponential rates. Concurrently, the quest to find a way to punish international crimes shifted from being the exclusive responsibility of legal experts to being shared with international human rights activism.

NGOs helped birth the ICC through advocacy and championing for the prosecution of perpetrators of crimes against humanity. NGOs closely monitor the organization&#x27;s declarations and actions, ensuring that the work that is being executed on behalf of the ICC is fulfilling its objectives and responsibilities to civil society. According to Benjamin Schiff, &quot;From the Statute Conference onward, the relationship between the ICC and the NGOs has probably been closer, more consistent, and more vital to the Court than have analogous relations between NGOs and any other international organization.&quot;

There are a number of NGOs working on a variety of issues related to the ICC. The NGO Coalition for the International Criminal Court has served as a sort of umbrella for NGOs to coordinate with each other on similar objectives related to the ICC. The CICC has 2,500 member organizations in 150 countries. The original steering committee included representatives from the World Federalist Movement, the International Commission of Jurists, Amnesty International, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, Parliamentarians for Global Action, and No Peace Without Justice. Today, many of the NGOs with which the ICC cooperates are members of the CICC. These organizations come from a range of backgrounds, spanning from major international NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, to smaller, more local organizations focused on peace and justice missions. Many work closely with states, such as the International Criminal Law Network, founded and predominantly funded by the Hague municipality and the Dutch Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs. The CICC also claims organizations that are themselves federations, such as the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH).

CICC members subscribe to three principles that permit them to work under the umbrella of the CICC, so long as their objectives match them:
* Promoting worldwide ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute of the ICC
* Maintaining the integrity of the Rome Statute of the ICC, and
* Ensuring the ICC will be as fair, effective and independent as possible

The NGOs that work under the CICC do not normally pursue agendas exclusive to the work of the Court, rather they may work for broader causes, such as general human rights issues, victims&#x27; rights, gender rights, rule of law, conflict mediation, and peace. The CICC coordinates their efforts to improve the efficiency of NGOs&#x27; contributions to the Court and to pool their influence on major common issues. From the ICC side, it has been useful to have the CICC channel NGO contacts with the Court so that its officials do not have to interact individually with thousands of separate organizations.

NGOs have been crucial to the evolution of the ICC, as they assisted in the creation of the normative climate that urged states to seriously consider the Court&#x27;s formation. Their legal experts helped shape the Statute, while their lobbying efforts built support for it. They advocate Statute ratification globally and work at expert and political levels within member states for passage of necessary domestic legislation. NGOs are greatly represented at meetings for the Assembly of States Parties, and they use the ASP meetings to press for decisions promoting their priorities. Many of these NGOs have reasonable access to important officials at the ICC because of their involvement during the Statute process. They are engaged in monitoring, commenting upon, and assisting in the ICC&#x27;s activities.

The ICC often depends on NGOs to interact with local populations. The Registry Public Information Office personnel and Victims Participation and Reparations Section officials hold seminars for local leaders, professionals and the media to spread the word about the Court. These are the kinds of events that are often hosted or organized by local NGOs. Because there can be challenges with determining which of these NGOs are legitimate, CICC regional representatives often have the ability to help screen and identify trustworthy organizations.

NGOs are also &quot;sources of criticism, exhortation and pressure upon&quot; the ICC. The ICC heavily depends on NGOs for its operations. Although NGOs and states cannot directly impact the judicial nucleus of the organization, they can impart information on crimes, can help locate victims and witnesses, and can promote and organize victim participation. NGOs outwardly comment on the Court&#x27;s operations, &quot;push for expansion of its activities especially in the new justice areas of outreach in conflict areas, in victims&#x27; participation and reparations, and in upholding due-process standards and defense &#x27;equality of arms&#x27; and so implicitly set an agenda for the future evolution of the ICC.&quot; The relatively uninterrupted progression of NGO involvement with the ICC may mean that NGOs have become repositories of more institutional historical knowledge about the ICC than its national representatives, and have greater expertise than some of the organization&#x27;s employees themselves. While NGOs look to mold the ICC to satisfy the interests and priorities that they have worked for since the early 1990s, they unavoidably press against the limits imposed upon the ICC by the states that are members of the organization. NGOs can pursue their own mandates, irrespective of whether they are compatible with those of other NGOs, while the ICC must respond to the complexities of its own mandate as well as those of the states and NGOs.

Another issue has been that NGOs possess &quot;exaggerated senses of their ownership over the organization and, having been vital to and successful in promoting the Court, were not managing to redefine their roles to permit the Court its necessary independence.&quot; Additionally, because there does exist such a gap between the large human rights organizations and the smaller peace-oriented organizations, it is difficult for ICC officials to manage and gratify all of their NGOs. &quot;ICC officials recognize that the NGOs pursue their own agendas, and that they will seek to pressure the ICC in the direction of their own priorities rather than necessarily understanding or being fully sympathetic to the myriad constraints and pressures under which the Court operates.&quot; Both the ICC and the NGO community avoid criticizing each other publicly or vehemently, although NGOs have released advisory and cautionary messages regarding the ICC. They avoid taking stances that could potentially give the Court&#x27;s adversaries, particularly the U.S., more motive to berate the organization.

==Criticism and opposition==
===African states===
In October 2016, after repeated claims that the court was biased against African states, Burundi, South Africa and the Gambia announced their withdrawals from the Rome Statute. Following Gambia&#x27;s presidential election later that year, which ended the long rule of Yahya Jammeh, Gambia rescinded its withdrawal notification. A decision by the High Court of South Africa in early 2017 ruled that the attempted withdrawal was unconstitutional, as it had not been agreed by Parliament, prompting the South African government to inform the UN that it was revoking its decision to withdraw.

===African accusations of Western imperialism===

The ICC has been accused of bias and as being a tool of Western imperialism, only punishing leaders from small, weak states while ignoring crimes committed by richer and more powerful states. This sentiment has been expressed particularly by African leaders due to an alleged disproportionate focus of the Court on Africa, while it claims to have a global mandate. Until January 2016, all nine situations which the ICC had been investigating were in African countries.

African critics have suggested the ICC is acting as a neo-colonial force seeking to further empower Western political and extractive interests in Africa.&quot;. Scholar Awol Allo has described the court&#x27;s underlying problem that has led to these challenges with Africa as not overt racism, but Eurocentrism. Another analysis suggests that African states are motivated by concerns over Africa&#x27;s place in world order: the problem is the sovereign inequality displayed by the ICC prosecutor&#x27;s focus.

The prosecution of Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto and President Uhuru Kenyatta (both charged before coming into office) led to the Kenyan parliament passing a motion calling for Kenya&#x27;s withdrawal from the ICC, and the country called on the other 33 African states party to the ICC to withdraw their support, an issue which was discussed at a special African Union (AU) summit in October 2013.

Though the ICC has denied the charge of disproportionately targeting African leaders, and claims to stand up for victims wherever they may be, Kenya was not alone in criticising the ICC. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir visited Kenya, South Africa, China, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Ethiopia, Qatar and several other countries despite an outstanding ICC warrant for his arrest but was not arrested; he said that the charges against him are &quot;exaggerated&quot; and that the ICC was a part of a &quot;Western plot&quot; against him. Ivory Coast&#x27;s government opted not to transfer former first lady Simone Gbagbo to the court but to instead try her at home. Rwanda&#x27;s ambassador to the African Union, Joseph Nsengimana, argued that &quot;It is not only the case of Kenya. We have seen international justice become more and more a political matter.&quot; Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni accused the ICC of &quot;mishandling complex African issues&quot;. Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, at the time AU chairman, told the UN General Assembly at the General debate of the sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly: &quot;The manner in which the ICC has been operating has left a very bad impression in Africa. It is totally unacceptable.&quot;

===African Union (AU) withdrawal proposal===

South African President Jacob Zuma said the perceptions of the ICC as &quot;unreasonable&quot; led to the calling of the special AU summit on 13 October 2015. Botswana is a notable supporter of the ICC in Africa. At the summit, the AU did not endorse the proposal for a collective withdrawal from the ICC due to lack of support for the idea. The summit concluded that serving heads of state should not be put on trial and that the Kenyan cases should be deferred. Ethiopian formerly Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom said: &quot;We have rejected the double standard that the ICC is applying in dispensing international justice.&quot; Despite these calls, the ICC went ahead with requiring William Ruto to attend his trial. The UNSC was then asked to consider deferring the trials of Kenyatta and Ruto for a year, but this was rejected. In November, the ICC&#x27;s Assembly of State Parties responded to Kenya&#x27;s calls for an exemption for sitting heads of state by agreeing to consider amendments to the Rome Statute to address the concerns.

On 7 October 2016, Burundi announced that it would leave the ICC, after the court began investigating political violence in that nation. In the two weeks that followed, South Africa and The Gambia also announced their intention to leave the court, with Kenya and Namibia reportedly also considering departure. All three nations cited the fact that all 39 people indicted by the court over its history by that date had been African and that the court has made no effort to investigate war crimes tied to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Following The Gambia&#x27;s presidential election later that year, which ended the long rule of Yahya Jammeh, the new government rescinded its withdrawal notification. The High Court of South Africa ruled on 2 February 2017 that the South African government&#x27;s notice to withdraw was unconstitutional and invalid. On 7 March 2017 the South African government formally revoked its intention to withdraw. The ruling ANC revealed on 5 July 2017 that its intention to withdraw stands.

===Israel===

In 2020, the +972 magazine, based in Israel, reported political interference coming from Israel and the U.S. when Fatou Bensouda, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court at The Hague, announced that &quot;there is legal basis to probe Israel and Palestinian groups over war crimes in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip, and that her office was ready to investigate the matter&quot;. In 2018, when the Israeli government wanted to demolish the West Bank village of Khan al Ahmar, Bensouda herself explicitly warned Israel that doing so could be considered a ‚Äòwar crime‚Äô. The Israeli government&#x27;s response was to publicly defy the court, describing the prosecutor&#x27;s statement as ‚Äòpure anti-Semitism‚Äô in Netanyahu‚Äôs words.
&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2024, on the basis of anonymous sources, that Israel had conducted a nine-year &quot;war&quot; against the ICC. These sources alleged that Israeli intelligence agencies were used to &quot;surveil, hack, pressure, smear and allegedly threaten senior ICC staff in an effort to derail the court&#x27;s inquiries.&quot; In particular, Yossi Cohen, director of Mossad at the time, allegedly threatened ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and her family in an attempt to dissuade her from opening war crime inquiries against Israel. The anonymous sources are said to be familiar with disclosures Bensouda made to the ICC regarding the operation.

In November 2024, after the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Israel‚ÄìHamas war, Netanyahu accused the ICC of antisemitism, while Gallant argued the Court set &quot;a dangerous precedent against the right to self-defence and ethical warfare and encourages murderous terrorism.&quot; In that same November, Israel appealed the ICC warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant. 

In November 2024, France argued that the arrest warrants for Israeli leaders are not valid because Israel is not a member of the ICC.

In January 2025, Polish prime minister Donald Tusk guaranteed safe passage for senior Israeli officials, including Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to an event in Poland marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The majority of the Polish public disagreed with the Polish government&#x27;s decision not to arrest Netanyahu.

Germany&#x27;s CDU leader Friedrich Merz criticized the ICC&#x27;s decision to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. In February 2025, one day after the 2025 German federal election, he announced his will to invite Netanyahu to Germany, &quot;as an open challenge&quot; to the decision of the ICC.

===Philippines===
Following the announcement that the ICC would open a preliminary investigation on the Philippines in connection to its escalating drug war, President Rodrigo Duterte announced on 14 March 2018 that the Philippines would start to submit plans to withdraw, completing the process on 17 March 2019. The ICC pointed out that it retained jurisdiction over the Philippines during the period when it was a state party to the Rome Statute, from November 2011 to March 2019.

===Russia===
In March 2023, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced that Russia did not recognize the Court&#x27;s decision to issue an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin on account of war crimes in Ukraine and noted that Russia, like other countries which had not ratified the Rome Statute, did not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICC, saying &quot;And accordingly, any decisions of this kind are null and void for the Russian Federation from the point of view of law.&quot;

State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin wrote on Telegram, &quot;Yankees, hands off Putin!&quot; calling the move evidence of Western &quot;hysteria&quot;, and saying that &quot;we regard any attacks on the President of the Russian Federation as aggression against our country&quot;.

South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor criticized the ICC for not having what she called an &quot;evenhanded approach&quot; to all leaders responsible for violations of international law. South Africa, which failed in its obligation to arrest visiting Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in June 2015, invited Vladimir Putin to the 15th BRICS Summit in Durban. On 19 July 2023, South Africa announced that &quot;by mutual agreement&quot; Putin would not attend the summit. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attended in Putin&#x27;s place.

In the months following the arrest warrant for Putin being issued, Russia issued warrants for the arrest of multiple ICC officials, including the court&#x27;s president Piotr Hofma≈Ñski and its vice-president Luz del Carmen Ib√°√±ez Carranza.

In advance of a visit by Putin to Mongolia on 3 September 2024, the ICC stated that Mongolia was obligated to place Putin under arrest, due to Mongolia being a signatory of the Rome Statute of the ICC. After failure to make the arrest, Mongolia was described by Ukraine as complicit in Putin&#x27;s war crimes. Following the visit and the refusal to arrest Putin, the Mongolia government said that the issue of energy relations is critical to the country and that &quot;Mongolia has always maintained a policy of neutrality in all its diplomatic relations, as demonstrated in our statements of record to date.&quot;

=== United States ===
President George W. Bush signed the American Service-Members&#x27; Protection Act, (informally referred to as &quot;The Hague Invasion Act&quot;), to signify the United States&#x27; opposition to any possible future jurisdiction of the court or its tribunals. The act gives the President the power to use &quot;all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any U.S. or allied personnel being detained or imprisoned by, on behalf of, or at the request of the International Criminal Court&quot;. During the administration of Barack Obama, U.S. opposition to the ICC evolved to &quot;positive engagement&quot;, although no effort was made to ratify the Rome Statute.

The subsequent Donald Trump administration was considerably more hostile to the Court, similar to the Bush administration threatening prosecution and financial sanctions on ICC judges and staff in U.S. courts as well as imposing visa bans in response to any investigation against American nationals in connection to alleged crimes and atrocities perpetrated by the U.S. in Afghanistan. The threat included sanctions against any of over 120 countries which have ratified the Court for cooperating in the process. In November 2017, Fatou Bensouda advised the court to consider seeking charges for human rights abuses committed during the War in Afghanistan such as alleged rapes and tortures by the U.S. Armed Forces and the Central Intelligence Agency, crime against humanity committed by the Taliban, and war crimes committed by the Afghan National Security Forces. John Bolton, National Security Advisor of the United States, stated that ICC Court had no jurisdiction over the U.S., which did not ratify the Rome Statute. In 2020, overturning the previous decision not to proceed, senior judges at the ICC authorized an investigation into the alleged war crimes in Afghanistan.

On 11 June 2020, the United States announced sanctions on officials and employees, as well as their families, involved in investigating alleged crimes against humanity committed by U.S. armed forces in Afghanistan. This move was widely criticized by human rights groups. The U.S. ordered sanctions against the ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, and the ICC&#x27;s head of Jurisdiction, Complementary, and Cooperation Division, Phakiso Mochochok, for an investigation into alleged war crimes by U.S. forces and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Afghanistan since 2003. &quot;The US government has reason to doubt the honesty of the ICC. The Department of Justice has received substantial credible information that raises serious concerns about a long history of financial corruption and malfeasance at the highest levels of the office of the prosecutor&quot;, Attorney General William Barr stated. The ICC responded with a statement expressing &quot;profound regret at the announcement of further threats and coercive actions.&quot; &quot;These attacks constitute an escalation and an unacceptable attempt to interfere with the rule of law and the Court&#x27;s judicial proceedings&quot;, the statement said. &quot;They are announced with the declared aim of influencing the actions of ICC officials in the context of the court&#x27;s independent and objective investigations and impartial judicial proceedings.&quot;

On 30 September 2020, prominent United States human rights lawyers announced that they would sue Trump and his Administration‚Äîincluding Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, attorney general William Barr, and OFAC director Andrea Gacki, and the departments they head‚Äîon the grounds that Trump&#x27;s order had gagged them, violating their right to free speech and impeding their work in trying to obtain justice on behalf of victims of war crimes. One of the plaintiffs, Diane Marie Amann, stated that, as a result of sanctions against the chief prosecutor at the ICC, she herself risked having her family assets seized if she continued to work for children who are bought and sold by traffickers, killed, tortured, sexually abused and forced to become child soldiers.

On 4 January 2021, U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla in New York City issued a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration from imposing criminal or civil penalties against ICC personnel and those who support the court&#x27;s work, including the plaintiffs. The sanctions were subsequently lifted by the Biden administration Secretary of State Antony Blinken in April 2021.

In 2023, the Biden administration welcomed the issuing of an ICC arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. President Joe Biden said that the issuing of the warrant &quot;makes a very strong point&quot;.

In 2024, the Biden administration opposed an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged Israeli war crimes committed during the Israel‚ÄìHamas war in the Gaza Strip. President Biden denounced Netanyahu&#x27;s arrest warrant as &quot;outrageous.&quot; Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration would work with the US Congress on potential sanctions against the ICC. Prior to the issuing of the ICC&#x27;s arrest warrant for Netanyahu, a group of US Republican senators sent a letter to ICC prosecutor Karim Ahmad Khan that contained the warning &quot;Target Israel and we will target you. If you move forward ... we will move to end all American support for the ICC, sanction your employees and associates, and bar you and your families from the United States. You have been warned.&quot; The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to sanction ICC officials on 4 June 2024.

On 9 January 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the &quot;Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act&quot; by 243-140 to sanction the ICC in protest at its arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant issued in November 2024. On Feb. 6, Trump imposed economic sanctions by executive order.

On February 6, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing economic and travel sanctions on individuals involved in International Criminal Court (ICC) investigations targeting U.S. citizens and allies, notably Israel. This action coincided with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s visit to Washington. The sanctions entail freezing U.S. assets of designated individuals and prohibiting their entry into the United States. This move mirrors a similar stance taken during Trump&#x27;s first term, when sanctions were applied to ICC officials over investigations into alleged war crimes by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The United States, along with China, Russia, and Israel, is not a member of the ICC.

==== U.S. criticisms ====
The United States Department of State argues that there are &quot;insufficient checks and balances on the authority of the ICC prosecutor and judges&quot; and &quot;insufficient protection against politicized prosecutions or other abuses&quot;. The current law in the United States on the ICC is the &quot;American Service-Members&#x27; Protection Act&quot; (ASPA), 116 Stat. 820. The ASPA authorizes the President of the United States to use &quot;all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any U.S. or allied personnel being detained or imprisoned by, on behalf of, or at the request of the International Criminal Court&quot;. This authorization has led the act to be nicknamed the &quot;Hague Invasion Act&quot;, because the freeing of U.S. citizens by force might be possible only through military action.

On 10 September 2018, John R. Bolton, in his first major address as U.S. National Security Advisor, reiterated that the ICC lacks checks and balances, exercises &quot;jurisdiction over crimes that have disputed and ambiguous definitions&quot;, and has failed to &quot;deter and punish atrocity crimes&quot;. The ICC, Bolton said, was &quot;superfluous&quot;, given that &quot;domestic judicial systems already hold American citizens to the highest legal and ethical standards&quot;. He added that the U.S. would do everything &quot;to protect our citizens&quot; should the ICC attempt to prosecute U.S. servicemen over alleged detainee abuse in Afghanistan. In that event, ICC judges and prosecutors would be barred from entering the U.S., their funds in the U.S. would be sanctioned and the U.S. &quot;will prosecute them in the U.S. criminal system. We will do the same for any company or state that assists an ICC investigation of Americans&quot;, Bolton said. He also criticized Palestinian efforts to bring Israel before the ICC over allegations of human rights abuses in the West Bank and Gaza.

=== OPCD ===
Concerning the independent Office of Public Counsel for the Defence (OPCD), Thomas Lubanga&#x27;s defence team say they were given a smaller budget than the Prosecutor and that evidence and witness statements were slow to arrive.

===Impartiality===
The International Criminal Court is often &quot;critiqued for being selective, or imperialistic, or reflecting the geopolitical interests of powerful states,&quot; says Sarah Knuckey, a Columbia law professor. While many Western countries supported the arrest warrant for Russian President Putin, how they respond to the warrant against Israel&#x27;s Netanyahu will be &quot;a test of the genuineness of their commitment to international justice for all&quot;, she continued.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that the ICC&#x27;s prosecutor team takes no account of the roles played by the government in the conflict of Uganda, Rwanda or Congo. This led to a flawed investigation, because the ICC did not reach the conclusion of its verdict after considering the governments&#x27; position and actions in the conflict.

=== Unintentional consequences ===
Research indicates that prosecutions of leaders who are culpable of international crimes in the ICC makes them less likely to peacefully step down, which can prolong conflicts and incentivize them to make continued use of mass violence. It is also argued that there is little evidence that international criminal prosecution practically fosters peace: &quot;the ICC has been used as a means of intervention in ongoing conflicts with the expectation that the indictments, arrests, and trials of elite perpetrators have deterrence and preventive effects for atrocity crimes. Despite these legitimate intentions and great expectations, there is little evidence of the efficacy of justice as a means to peace&quot;.

=== State cooperation ===
That the ICC cannot mount successful cases without state cooperation is problematic for several reasons. It means that the ICC acts inconsistently in its selection of cases, is prevented from taking on hard cases and loses legitimacy. It also gives the ICC less deterrent value, as potential perpetrators of war crimes know that they can avoid ICC judgment by taking over government and refusing to cooperate.

=== Principle of complementarity ===
The Rome Statute&#x27;s principle of complementarity (that the Court will only prosecute if states are unwilling or unable to) is often taken for granted in the legal analysis of international criminal law and its jurisprudence. Initially the thorny issue of the actual application of the complementarity principle arose in 2008, when William Schabas published his influential paper. No substantive research was made by other scholars on this issue for quite some time. In June 2017, Victor Tsilonis advanced the same criticism which is reinforced by events, practices of the Office of the Prosecutor and ICC cases in the Essays in Honour of Nestor Courakis. His paper essentially argues that the Œël‚ÄêSenussi case arguably is the first instance of the complementarity principle&#x27;s actual implementation eleven whole years after the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

On the other hand, in 2017, Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda invoked the principle of complementarity in the situation between Russia and Georgia in the Ossetia region. Moreover, following the threats of certain African states (initially Burundi, Gambia and South Africa) to withdraw their ratifications, Bensouda again referred to the principle of complementarity as a core principle of ICC&#x27;s jurisdiction and has more extensively focused on the principle&#x27;s application on the latest Office of The Prosecutor&#x27;s Report on Preliminary Examination Activities 2016.

Some advocates have suggested that the ICC go &quot;beyond complementarity&quot; and systematically support national capacity for prosecutions. They argue that national prosecutions, where possible, are more cost-effective, preferable to victims and more sustainable.

===Jurisdiction over corporations===
There is a debate on whether the ICC should have jurisdiction over corporations that violate international law. Supporters argue that corporations can and do commit human rights violations, such as war crimes linked to raw materials in conflict zones. Critics argue that prosecuting corporations would compromise the principle of complementarity, that it would give corporations excessive power under international law, or that it would compromise voluntary initiatives by companies. John Ruggie has argued that jurisdiction of corporations under international law should be limited to international crimes, while Nicol√°s Carrillo-Santarelli of La Sabana University argues that it should cover all human rights violations.

Despite its lack of jurisdiction, the ICC announced in 2016 that it would prioritize criminal cases linked to land grabbing, illegal resource extraction, or environmental degradation caused by corporate activity. The proposed crime of ecocide would have jurisdiction over corporations as well as governments. Supporters of criminalizing ecocide argue that it would shift the ICC&#x27;s priorities away from Africa, since most environmental degradation is caused by states and corporations in the Global North.

<doc id="14883" wikidata="Q12837" url="?curid=14883" title="Iberian Peninsula">
<text>The Iberian Peninsula ( ), also known as Iberia, is a peninsula in south-western Europe. Mostly separated from the rest of the European landmass by the Pyrenees, it includes the territories of Peninsular Spain and Continental Portugal, comprising most of the region, as well as the tiny adjuncts of Andorra, Gibraltar, and, pursuant to the traditional definition of the Pyrenees as the peninsula&#x27;s northeastern boundary, a small part of France. With an area of approximately , and a population of roughly 53 million, it is the second-largest European peninsula by area, after the Scandinavian Peninsula.

==Etymology==

The Iberian Peninsula has always been associated with the River Ebro (Ibƒìros in ancient Greek and Ibƒìrus or Hibƒìrus in Latin). The association was so well known it was hardly necessary to state; for example, Ibƒìria was the country &quot;this side of the Ibƒìrus&quot; in Strabo. Pliny goes so far as to assert that the Greeks had called &quot;the whole of the peninsula&quot; Hiberia because of the Hiberus River. The river appears in the Ebro Treaty of 226 BCE between Rome and Carthage, setting the limit of Carthaginian interest at the Ebro. The fullest description of the treaty, stated in Appian, uses Ibƒìrus. With reference to this border, Polybius states that the &quot;native name&quot; is &quot;Ibƒìr&quot;, apparently the original word, stripped of its Greek or Latin &quot;-os&quot; or &quot;-us&quot; termination.

The early range of these natives, which geographers and historians place from the present southern Spain to the present southern France along the Mediterranean coast, is marked by instances of a readable script expressing a yet unknown language, dubbed &quot;Iberian&quot;. Whether this was the native name or was given to them by the Greeks for their residence near the Ebro remains unknown. Credence in Polybius imposes certain limitations on etymologizing: if the language remains unknown, the meanings of the words, including Iber, must also remain unknown. 

In modern Basque, the word &quot;ibar&quot; means &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;watered meadow&quot;, while &quot;ibai&quot; means &quot;river&quot;, but there is no proof connecting the names with &quot;Ebro&quot; or &quot;Iberia&quot;.

===Greek name===
The word &quot;Iberia&quot; comes from the Latin word originating from the Ancient Greek word (), used by Greek geographers under the rule of the Roman Empire to refer to what is known today in English as the Iberian Peninsula. At that time, the name did not describe a single geographical entity or a distinct population; the same name was used for the Kingdom of Iberia, natively known as Kartli in the Caucasus, the core region of what would later become the Kingdom of Georgia. 

It was Strabo who first reported the delineation of from Gaul () by the Pyrenees and included the entire land mass southwest (he says &quot;west&quot;) from there. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the consolidation of Romance languages, the word &quot;Iberia&quot; continued the Roman word and the Greek word .

The ancient Greeks reached the Iberian Peninsula, of which they had heard from the Phoenicians, by voyaging westward on the Mediterranean. Hecataeus of Miletus was the first known to use the term , which he wrote about . Herodotus of Halicarnassus says of the Phocaeans that &quot;it was they who made the Greeks acquainted with [...] Iberia.&quot; According to Strabo, prior historians used to mean the country &quot;this side of the (, the Ebro) as far north as the Rh√¥ne, but in his day they set the Pyrenees as the limit. Polybius respects that limit, but identifies Iberia as the Mediterranean side as far south as Gibraltar, with the Atlantic side having no name. Elsewhere he says that Saguntum is &quot;on the seaward foot of the range of hills connecting Iberia and Celtiberia.&quot;

===Roman names===

According to Charles Ebel, the ancient sources in both Latin and Greek use &quot;Hispania&quot; and &quot;Hiberia&quot; (Greek: &quot;Iberia&quot;) as synonyms. The confusion of the words was because of an overlapping in political and geographic perspectives. The Latin word &quot;Hiberia&quot;, similar to the Greek &quot;Iberia&quot;, literally translates to &quot;land of the Hiberians&quot;. This word was derived from the river &quot;Hiberus&quot; (now called Ebro or Ebre). &quot;Hiber&quot; (Iberian) was thus used as a term for peoples living near the river Ebro. The first mention in Roman literature was by the annalist poet Ennius in 200 BCE. Virgil wrote &quot;impacatos (H)iberos&quot; (&quot;restless Iberi&quot;) in his Georgics. 

Roman geographers and other prose writers from the time of the late Roman Republic called the entire peninsula &quot;Hispania&quot;. In Greek and Roman antiquity, the name &quot;Hesperia&quot; was used for both the Italian and Iberian Peninsula; in the latter case &quot;Hesperia Ultima&quot; (referring to its position in the far west) appears as form of disambiguation from the former among Roman writers. Also since Roman antiquity, Jews gave the name &quot;Sepharad&quot; to the peninsula.

As they became politically interested in the former Carthaginian territories, the Romans began to use the names &quot;Hispania Citerior&quot; and &quot;Hispania Ulterior&quot; for &#x27;near&#x27; and &#x27;far&#x27; Hispania. At the time Hispania was made up of three Roman provinces: Hispania Baetica, Hispania Tarraconensis, and Hispania Lusitania. Strabo says that the Romans use &quot;Hispania&quot; and &quot;Iberia&quot; synonymously, distinguishing between the &quot;near&quot; northern and the &quot;far&quot; southern provinces. (The name &quot;Iberia&quot; was ambiguous, being also the name of the Kingdom of Iberia in the Caucasus.)

Whatever languages may generally have been spoken on the peninsula soon gave way to Latin, except for that of the Vascones, which was preserved as a language isolate by the barrier of the Pyrenees.

=== Modern name ===
The modern phrase &quot;Iberian Peninsula&quot; was coined by the French geographer Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent on his 1823 work &quot;Guide du Voyageur en Espagne&quot;. Prior to that date, geographers had used the terms &#x27;Spanish Peninsula&#x27; or &#x27;Pyrenaean Peninsula&#x27;.

==Prehistory==
===Palaeolithic===
The Iberian Peninsula has been inhabited by members of the &quot;Homo&quot; genus for at least 1.2¬†million years as remains found in the sites in the Atapuerca Mountains demonstrate. Among these sites is the cave of Gran Dolina, where six hominin skeletons, dated between 780,000 and one million years ago, were found in 1994. Experts have debated whether these skeletons belong to the species &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;, or a new species called &quot;Homo antecessor&quot;.

Around 200,000 BP, during the Lower Paleolithic period, Neanderthals first entered the Iberian Peninsula. Around 70,000 BP, during the Middle Paleolithic period, the last glacial event began and the Neanderthal Mousterian culture was established. Around 37,000 BP, during the Upper Paleolithic, the Neanderthal Ch√¢telperronian cultural period began. Emanating from Southern France, this culture extended into the north of the peninsula. It continued to exist until around 30,000 BP, when Neanderthal man faced extinction.

About 40,000 years ago, anatomically modern humans entered the Iberian Peninsula from across the Pyrenees. On the Iberian Peninsula, modern humans developed a series of different cultures, such as the Aurignacian, Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian cultures, some of them characterized by the complex forms of the art of the Upper Paleolithic.

===Neolithic===
During the Neolithic expansion, various megalithic cultures developed in the Iberian Peninsula. An open seas navigation culture from the east Mediterranean, called the Cardium culture, also extended its influence to the eastern coasts of the peninsula, possibly as early as the 5th millennium BCE. These people may have had some relation to the subsequent development of the Iberian civilization.

As is the case for most of the rest of Southern Europe, the principal ancestral origin of modern Iberians are Early European Farmers who arrived during the Neolithic. The large predominance of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup R1b, common throughout Western Europe, is testimony to a considerable input from various waves of (predominantly male) Western Steppe Herders from the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe during the Bronze Age. Iberia experienced a significant genetic turnover, with 100% of the paternal ancestry and 40% of the overall ancestry being replaced by peoples with steppe-related ancestry.

===Chalcolithic===
In the Chalcolithic (¬†3000 BCE), a series of complex cultures developed that would give rise to the peninsula&#x27;s first civilizations and to extensive exchange networks reaching to the Baltic, Middle East and North Africa. Around 2800 ‚Äì 2700 BCE, the Beaker culture, which produced the &quot;Maritime Bell Beaker&quot;, probably originated in the vibrant copper-using communities of the Tagus estuary and spread from there to many parts of western Europe.

===Bronze Age===
The Bronze Age began on the Iberian Peninsula in 2100 cal. BC according to radiocarbon datings of several key sites.

Bronze Age cultures developed beginning ¬†1800 BCE, when the culture of Los Millares was followed by that of El Argar. During the Early Bronze Age, southeastern Iberia saw the emergence of important settlements, a development that has compelled some archeologists to propose that these settlements indicate the advent of state-level social structures. From this centre, bronze metalworking technology spread to other cultures like the Bronze of Levante, South-Western Iberian Bronze and Las Cogotas.

Preceded by the Chalcolithic sites of Los Millares, the Argaric culture flourished in southeastern Iberia in from 2200 BC to 1550 BC, when depopulation of the area ensued along with disappearing of copper‚Äìbronze‚Äìarsenic metallurgy. The most accepted model for El Argar has been that of an early state society, most particularly in terms of class division, exploitation, and coercion, with agricultural production, maybe also human labour, controlled by the larger hilltop settlements, and the elite using violence in practical and ideological terms to clamp down on the population. Ecological degradation, landscape opening, fires, pastoralism, and maybe tree cutting for mining have been suggested as reasons for the collapse.

The culture of the &quot;motillas&quot; developed an early system of groundwater supply plants (the so-called &quot;motillas&quot;) in the upper Guadiana basin (in the southern &quot;meseta&quot;) in a context of extreme aridification in the area in the wake of the 4.2-kiloyear climatic event, which roughly coincided with the transition from the Copper Age to the Bronze Age. Increased precipitation and recovery of the water table from about 1800 BC onward should have led to the forsaking of the &quot;motillas&quot; (which may have flooded) and the redefinition of the relation of the inhabitants of the territory with the environment.

==Proto-history==


By the Iron Age, starting in the 8th century BCE, the Iberian Peninsula consisted of complex agrarian and urban civilizations, either Pre-Celtic or Celtic (such as the Celtiberians, Gallaeci, Astures, Celtici, Lusitanians and others), the cultures of the Iberians in the eastern and southern zones and the cultures of the Aquitanian in the western portion of the Pyrenees.

As early as the 12th century BCE, the Phoenicians, a thalassocratic civilization originally from the Eastern Mediterranean, began to explore the coastline of the peninsula, interacting with the metal-rich communities in the southwest of the peninsula (contemporarily known as the semi-mythical Tartessos). Around 1100 BCE, Phoenician merchants founded the trading colony of Gadir or Gades (modern day C√°diz). Phoenicians established a permanent trading port in the Gadir colony in response to the increasing demand of silver from the Assyrian Empire.

The seafaring Phoenicians, Greeks and Carthaginians successively settled along the Mediterranean coast and founded trading colonies there over several centuries. In the 8th century BCE, the first Greek colonies, such as Emporion (modern Emp√∫ries), were founded along the Mediterranean coast on the east, leaving the south coast to the Phoenicians.

Together with the presence of Phoenician and Greek epigraphy, several paleohispanic scripts developed in the Iberian Peninsula along the 1st millennium BCE. The development of a primordial paleohispanic script antecessor to the rest of paleohispanic scripts (originally supposed to be a non-redundant semi-syllabary) derived from the Phoenician alphabet and originated in Southwestern Iberia by the 7th century BCE has been tentatively proposed.

In the sixth century BCE, the Carthaginians arrived in the peninsula while struggling with the Greeks for control of the Western Mediterranean. Their most important colony was Carthago Nova (modern-day Cartagena, Spain).

==History==
===Roman rule===

In 218 BCE, during the Second Punic War against the Carthaginians, the first Roman troops occupied the Iberian Peninsula, known to them as Hispania. After 197, the territories of the peninsula most accustomed to external contact and with the most urban tradition (the Mediterranean Coast and the Guadalquivir Valley) were divided by Romans into Hispania Ulterior and Hispania Citerior. Local rebellions were quelled, with a 195 Roman campaign under Cato the Elder ravaging hotspots of resistance in the northeastern Ebro Valley and beyond. The threat to Roman interests posed by Celtiberians and Lusitanians in uncontrolled territories lingered in. Further wars of indigenous resistance, such as the Celtiberian Wars and the Lusitanian War, were fought in the 2nd century. Urban growth took place, and population progressively moved from hillforts to the plains.

An example of the interaction of slaving and ecocide, the aftermath of the conquest increased mining extractive processes in the southwest of the peninsula (which required a massive number of forced laborers, initially from Hispania and latter also from the Gallic borderlands and other locations of the Mediterranean), bringing in a far-reaching environmental outcome vis-√†-vis long-term global pollution records, with levels of atmospheric pollution from mining across the Mediterranean during Classical Antiquity having no match until the Industrial Revolution.

In addition to mineral extraction (of which the region was the leading supplier in the early Roman world, with production of the likes of gold, silver, copper, lead, and cinnabar), Hispania also produced manufactured goods (sigillata pottery, colourless glass, linen garments) fish and fish sauce (garum), dry crops (such as wheat and, more importantly, esparto), olive oil, and wine.

The process of Romanization spurred on throughout the first century BC. The peninsula was also the battleground of civil wars between rulers of the Roman republic; such as the Sertorian War, and the conflict between Caesar and Pompey later in the century.

During their 600-year occupation of the Iberian Peninsula, the Romans introduced the Latin language that influenced many of the languages that exist today in the Iberian peninsula.
=== Pre-modern Iberia ===
In the early fifth century, Germanic peoples occupied the peninsula, namely the Suebi, the Vandals (Silingi and Hasdingi) and their allies, the Alans. Only the kingdom of the Suebi (Quadi and Marcomanni) would endure after the arrival of another wave of Germanic invaders, the Visigoths, who occupied all of the Iberian Peninsula and expelled or partially integrated the Vandals and the Alans. The Visigoths eventually occupied the Suebi kingdom and its capital city, Bracara (modern day Braga), in 584‚Äì585. They would also occupy the province of the Byzantine Empire (552‚Äì624) of Spania in the south of the peninsula. However, Balearic Islands remained in Byzantine hands until Umayyad conquest, which began in 703 CE and was completed in 902 CE.
In 711, a Muslim army conquered the Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania. Under Tariq ibn Ziyad, the Islamic army landed at Gibraltar and, in an eight-year campaign, occupied all except the northern kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula in the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. Al-Andalus (, tr. &quot;al- æAndal≈´s&quot;, possibly &quot;Land of the Vandals&quot;), is the Arabic name given to Muslim Iberia. The Muslim conquerors were Arabs and Berbers; following the conquest, conversion and arabization of the Hispano-Roman population took place, (&quot;muwalladum&quot; or &quot;Mulad√≠&quot;). After a long process, spurred on in the 9th and 10th centuries, the majority of the population in Al-Andalus eventually converted to Islam. The Muslims were referred to by the generic name &quot;Moors&quot;. The Muslim population was divided per ethnicity (Arabs, Berbers, Mulad√≠), and the supremacy of Arabs over the rest of group was a recurrent causal for strife, rivalry and hatred, particularly between Arabs and Berbers. Arab elites could be further divided in the Yemenites (first wave) and the Syrians (second wave). Christians and Jews were allowed to live as part of a stratified society under the &quot;dhimmah&quot; system, although Jews became very important in certain fields. Some Christians migrated to the Northern Christian kingdoms, while those who stayed in Al-Andalus progressively arabised and became known as &quot;musta&#x27;arab&quot; (mozarabs). The slave population comprised the &quot;·π¢aqƒÅliba&quot; (literally meaning &quot;slavs&quot;, although they were slaves of generic European origin) as well as Sudanese slaves.

The Umayyad rulers faced a major Berber Revolt in the early 740s; the uprising originally broke out in North Africa (Tangier) and later spread across the peninsula. Following the Abbasid takeover from the Umayyads and the shift of the economic centre of the Islamic Caliphate from Damascus to Baghdad, the western province of al-Andalus was marginalised and ultimately became politically autonomous as independent emirate in 756, ruled by one of the last surviving Umayyad royals, Abd al-Rahman I.
Al-Andalus became a center of culture and learning, especially during the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba. The Caliphate reached the height of its power under the rule of Abd-ar-Rahman III and his successor al-Hakam II, becoming then, in the view of Jaime Vicens Vives, &quot;the most powerful state in Europe&quot;. Abd-ar-Rahman III also managed to expand the clout of Al-Andalus across the Strait of Gibraltar, waging war, as well as his successor, against the Fatimid Empire.

Between the 8th and 12th centuries, Al-Andalus enjoyed a notable urban vitality, both in terms of the growth of the preexisting cities as well as in terms of founding of new ones: C√≥rdoba reached a population of 100,000 by the 10th century, Toledo 30,000 by the 11th century and Seville 80,000 by the 12th century.

During the Middle Ages, the North of the peninsula housed many small Christian polities including the Kingdom of Castile, the Kingdom of Aragon, the Kingdom of Navarre, the Kingdom of Le√≥n or the Kingdom of Portugal, as well as a number of counties that spawned from the Carolingian Marca Hispanica. Christian and Muslim polities fought and allied among themselves in variable alliances. The Christian kingdoms progressively expanded south taking over Muslim territory in what is historiographically known as the &quot;Reconquista&quot; (the latter concept has been however noted as product of the claim to a pre-existing Spanish Catholic nation and it would not necessarily convey adequately &quot;the complexity of centuries of warring and other more peaceable interactions between Muslim and Christian kingdoms in medieval Iberia between 711 and 1492&quot;).

The Caliphate of C√≥rdoba was subsumed in a period of upheaval and civil war (the Fitna of al-Andalus) and collapsed in the early 11th century, spawning a series of ephemeral statelets, the &quot;taifas&quot;. Until the mid 11th century, most of the territorial expansion southwards of the Kingdom of Asturias/Le√≥n was carried out through a policy of agricultural colonization rather than through military operations; then, profiting from the feebleness of the taifa principalities, Ferdinand I of Le√≥n seized Lamego and Viseu (1057‚Äì1058) and Coimbra (1064) away from the Taifa of Badajoz (at times at war with the Taifa of Seville); Meanwhile, in the same year Coimbra was conquered, in the Northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula, the Kingdom of Aragon took Barbastro from the Hudid Taifa of L√©rida as part of an international expedition sanctioned by Pope Alexander II. Most critically, Alfonso VI of Le√≥n-Castile conquered Toledo and its wider taifa in 1085, in what it was seen as a critical event at the time, entailing also a huge territorial expansion, advancing from the Sistema Central to La Mancha. In 1086, following the siege of Zaragoza by Alfonso VI of Le√≥n-Castile, the Almoravids, religious zealots originally from the deserts of the Maghreb, landed in the Iberian Peninsula, and, having inflicted a serious defeat to Alfonso VI at the battle of Zalaca, began to seize control of the remaining taifas.

The Almoravids in the Iberian peninsula progressively relaxed strict observance of their faith, and treated both Jews and Mozarabs harshly, facing uprisings across the peninsula, initially in the Western part. The Almohads, another North-African Muslim sect of Masmuda Berber origin who had previously undermined the Almoravid rule south of the Strait of Gibraltar, first entered the peninsula in 1146.

Somewhat straying from the trend taking place in other locations of the Latin West since the 10th century, the period comprising the 11th and 13th centuries was not one of weakening monarchical power in the Christian kingdoms. The relatively novel concept of &quot;frontier&quot; (Sp: &quot;frontera&quot;), already reported in Aragon by the second half of the 11th century become widespread in the Christian Iberian kingdoms by the beginning of the 13th century, in relation to the more or less conflictual border with Muslim lands.

By the beginning of the 13th century, a power reorientation took place in the Iberian Peninsula (parallel to the Christian expansion in Southern Iberia and the increasing commercial impetus of Christian powers across the Mediterranean) and to a large extent, trade-wise, the Iberian Peninsula reorientated towards the North away from the Muslim World.

During the Middle Ages, the monarchs of Castile and Le√≥n, from Alfonso V and Alfonso VI (crowned &quot;Hispaniae Imperator&quot;) to Alfonso X and Alfonso XI tended to embrace an imperial ideal based on a dual Christian and Jewish ideology. Despite the hegemonic ambitions of its rulers and the consolidation of the union of Castile and Le√≥n after 1230, it should be pointed that, except for a brief period in the 1330s and 1340s, Castile tended to be nonetheless &quot;essentially unstable&quot; from a political standpoint until the late 15th century.

Merchants from Genoa and Pisa were conducting an intense trading activity in Catalonia already by the 12th century, and later in Portugal. Since the 13th century, the Crown of Aragon expanded overseas; led by Catalans, it attained an overseas empire in the Western Mediterranean, with a presence in Mediterranean islands such as the Balearics, Sicily and Sardinia, and even conquering Naples in the mid-15th century. Genoese merchants invested heavily in the Iberian commercial enterprise with Lisbon becoming, according to Virg√≠nia Rau, the &quot;great centre of Genoese trade&quot; in the early 14th century. The Portuguese would later detach their trade to some extent from Genoese influence. The Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, neighbouring the Strait of Gibraltar and founded upon a vassalage relationship with the Crown of Castile, also insinuated itself into the European mercantile network, with its ports fostering intense trading relations with the Genoese as well, but also with the Catalans, and to a lesser extent, with the Venetians, the Florentines, and the Portuguese.

Between 1275 and 1340, Granada became involved in the &quot;crisis of the Strait&quot;, and was caught in a complex geopolitical struggle (&quot;a kaleidoscope of alliances&quot;) with multiple powers vying for dominance of the Western Mediterranean, complicated by the unstable relations of Muslim Granada with the Marinid Sultanate. The conflict reached a climax in the 1340 Battle of R√≠o Salado, when, this time in alliance with Granada, the Marinid Sultan (and Caliph pretender) Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman made the last Marinid attempt to set up a power base in the Iberian Peninsula. The lasting consequences of the resounding Muslim defeat to an alliance of Castile and Portugal with naval support from Aragon and Genoa ensured Christian supremacy over the Iberian Peninsula and the preeminence of Christian fleets in the Western Mediterranean.

The 1348‚Äì1350 bubonic plague devastated large parts of the Iberian Peninsula, leading to a sudden economic cessation. Many settlements in northern Castile and Catalonia were left forsaken. The plague marked the start of the hostility and downright violence towards religious minorities (particularly the Jews) as an additional consequence in the Iberian realms.

The 14th century was a period of great upheaval in the Iberian realms. After the death of Peter the Cruel of Castile (reigned 1350‚Äì69), the House of Trast√°mara succeeded to the throne in the person of Peter&#x27;s half brother, Henry II (reigned 1369‚Äì79). In the kingdom of Arag√≥n, following the death without heirs of John I (reigned 1387‚Äì96) and Martin I (reigned 1396‚Äì1410), a prince of the House of Trast√°mara, Ferdinand I (reigned 1412‚Äì16), succeeded to the Aragonese throne. The Hundred Years&#x27; War also spilled over into the Iberian peninsula, with Castile particularly taking a role in the conflict by providing key naval support to France that helped lead to that nation&#x27;s eventual victory. After the accession of Henry III to the throne of Castile, the populace, exasperated by the preponderance of Jewish influence, perpetrated a massacre of Jews at Toledo. In 1391, mobs went from town to town throughout Castile and Aragon, killing an estimated 50,000 Jews, or even as many as 100,000, according to Jane Gerber. Women and children were sold as slaves to Muslims, and many synagogues were converted into churches. According to Hasdai Crescas, about 70 Jewish communities were destroyed.

During the 15th century, Portugal, which had ended its southwards territorial expansion across the Iberian Peninsula in 1249 with the conquest of the Algarve, initiated an overseas expansion in parallel to the rise of the House of Aviz, conquering Ceuta (1415) arriving at Porto Santo (1418), Madeira and the Azores, as well as establishing additional outposts along the North-African Atlantic coast. In addition, already in the Early Modern Period, between the completion of the Granada War in 1492 and the death of Ferdinand of Aragon in 1516, the Hispanic Monarchy would make strides in the imperial expansion along the Mediterranean coast of the Maghreb.
During the Late Middle Ages, the Jews acquired considerable power and influence in Castile and Aragon.

Throughout the late Middle Ages, the Crown of Aragon took part in the mediterranean slave trade, with Barcelona (already in the 14th century), Valencia (particularly in the 15th century) and, to a lesser extent, Palma de Mallorca (since the 13th century), becoming dynamic centres in this regard, involving chiefly eastern and Muslim peoples. Castile engaged later in this economic activity, rather by adhering to the incipient atlantic slave trade involving sub-saharan people thrusted by Portugal (Lisbon being the largest slave centre in Western Europe) since the mid 15th century, with Seville becoming another key hub for the slave trade. Following the advance in the conquest of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada, the seizure of M√°laga entailed the addition of another notable slave centre for the Crown of Castile.

By the end of the 15th century (1490) the Iberian kingdoms (including here the Balearic Islands) had an estimated population of 6.525¬†million (Crown of Castile, 4.3¬†million; Portugal, 1.0¬†million; Principality of Catalonia, 0.3¬†million; Kingdom of Valencia, 0.255¬†million; Kingdom of Granada, 0.25¬†million; Kingdom of Aragon, 0.25¬†million; Kingdom of Navarre, 0.12¬†million and the Kingdom of Mallorca, 0.05¬†million).

For three decades in the 15th century, the &quot;Hermandad de las Marismas&quot;, the trading association formed by the ports of Castile along the Cantabrian coast, resembling in some ways the Hanseatic League, fought against the latter, an ally of England, a rival of Castile in political and economic terms. Castile sought to claim the Gulf of Biscay as its own. In 1419, the powerful Castilian navy thoroughly defeated a Hanseatic fleet in La Rochelle.

In the late 15th century, the imperial ambition of the Iberian powers was pushed to new heights by the Catholic Monarchs in Castile and Aragon, and by Manuel I in Portugal.

The last Muslim stronghold, Granada, was conquered by a combined Castilian and Aragonese force in 1492. As many as 100,000 Moors died or were enslaved in the military campaign, while 200,000 fled to North Africa. Muslims and Jews throughout the period were variously tolerated or shown intolerance in different Christian kingdoms. After the fall of Granada, all Muslims and Jews were ordered to convert to Christianity or face expulsion‚Äîas many as 200,000 Jews were expelled from Spain. Approximately 3,000,000 Muslims fled or were driven out of Spain between 1492 and 1610. Historian Henry Kamen estimates that some 25,000 Jews died en route from Spain. The Jews were also expelled from Sicily and Sardinia, which were under Aragonese rule, and an estimated 37,000 to 100,000 Jews left.

In 1497, King Manuel I of Portugal forced all Jews in his kingdom to convert or leave. That same year he expelled all Muslims that were not slaves, and in 1502 the Catholic Monarchs followed suit, imposing the choice of conversion to Christianity or exile and loss of property. Many Jews and Muslims fled to North Africa and the Ottoman Empire, while others publicly converted to Christianity and became known respectively as Marranos and Moriscos (after the old term &quot;Moors&quot;). However, many of these continued to practice their religion in secret. The Moriscos revolted several times and were ultimately forcibly expelled from Spain in the early 17th century. From 1609 to 1614, over 300,000 Moriscos were sent on ships to North Africa and other locations, and, of this figure, around 50,000 died resisting the expulsion, and 60,000 died on the journey.

A series of case studies by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University demonstrated that the change of relative supremacy from Portugal to the Hispanic Monarchy in the late 15th century was one of the few cases of avoidance of the Thucydides Trap.

===Modern Iberia===

Challenging the conventions about the advent of modernity, Immanuel Wallerstein pushed back the origins of the capitalist modernity to the Iberian expansion of the 15th century. During the 16th century Spain created a vast empire in the Americas, with a state monopoly in Seville becoming the center of the ensuing transatlantic trade, based on bullion. Iberian imperialism, starting by the Portuguese establishment of routes to Asia and the posterior transatlantic trade with the New World by Spaniards and Portuguese (along Dutch, English and French), precipitated the economic decline of the Italian Peninsula. The 16th century was one of population growth with increased pressure over resources; in the case of the Iberian Peninsula a part of the population moved to the Americas meanwhile Jews and Moriscos were banished, relocating to other places in the Mediterranean Basin. Most of the Moriscos remained in Spain after the Morisco revolt in Las Alpujarras during the mid-16th century, but roughly 300,000 of them were expelled from the country in 1609‚Äì1614, and emigrated &quot;en masse&quot; to North Africa.

In 1580, after the political crisis that followed the 1578 death of King Sebastian, Portugal became a dynastic composite entity of the Hapsburg Monarchy; thus, the whole peninsula was united politically during the period known as the Iberian Union (1580‚Äì1640). During the reign of Philip II of Spain (I of Portugal), the Councils of Portugal, Italy, Flanders and Burgundy were added to the group of counselling institutions of the Hispanic Monarchy, to which the Councils of Castile, Aragon, Indies, Chamber of Castile, Inquisition, Orders, and Crusade already belonged, defining the organization of the Royal court that underpinned the Polysynodial System through which the empire operated. During the Iberian union, the &quot;first great wave&quot; of the transatlantic slave trade happened, according to Enriqueta Vila Villar, as new markets opened because of the unification gave thrust to the slave trade.

By 1600, the percentage of urban population for Spain was roughly 11.4%, while for Portugal the urban population was estimated as 14.1%, which were both above the 7.6% European average of the time (edged only by the Low Countries and the Italian Peninsula). Some striking differences appeared among the different Iberian realms. Castile, extending across a 60% of the territory of the peninsula and having 80% of the population was a rather urbanised country, yet with a widespread distribution of cities. Meanwhile, the urban population in the Crown of Aragon was highly concentrated in a handful of cities: Zaragoza (Kingdom of Aragon), Barcelona (Principality of Catalonia), and, to a lesser extent in the Kingdom of Valencia, in Valencia, Alicante and Orihuela. The case of Portugal presented an hypertrophied capital, Lisbon (which greatly increased its population during the 16th century, from 56,000 to 60,000 inhabitants by 1527, to roughly 120,000 by the third quarter of the century) with its demographic dynamism stimulated by the Asian trade, followed at great distance by Porto and √âvora (both roughly accounting for 12,500 inhabitants). Throughout most of the 16th century, both Lisbon and Seville were among the Western Europe&#x27;s largest and most dynamic cities.

The 17th century has been largely considered as a very negative period for the Iberian economies, seen as a time of recession, crisis or even decline, the urban dynamism chiefly moving to Northern Europe. A dismantling of the inner city network in the Castilian plateau took place during this period (with a parallel accumulation of economic activity in the capital, Madrid), with only New Castile resisting recession in the interior. Regarding the Atlantic fa√ßade of Castile, aside from the severing of trade with Northern Europe, inter-regional trade with other regions in the Iberian Peninsula also suffered to some extent. In Aragon, suffering from similar problems than Castile, the expelling of the Moriscos in 1609 in the Kingdom of Valencia aggravated the recession. Silk turned from a domestic industry into a raw commodity to be exported. However, the crisis was uneven (affecting longer the centre of the peninsula), as both Portugal and the Mediterranean coastline recovered in the later part of the century by fuelling a sustained growth.

The aftermath of the intermittent 1640‚Äì1668 Portuguese Restoration War brought the House of Braganza as the new ruling dynasty in the Portuguese territories across the world (bar Ceuta), putting an end to the Iberian Union.

Despite both Portugal and Spain starting their path towards modernization with the liberal revolutions of the first half of the 19th century, this process was, concerning structural changes in the geographical distribution of the population, relatively tame compared to what took place after World War II in the Iberian Peninsula, when strong urban development ran in parallel to substantial rural flight patterns.

==Geography and geology==
The Iberian Peninsula is the westernmost of the three major southern European peninsulas‚Äîthe Iberian, Italian, and Balkan. It forms the westernmost portion of the larger Eurasian landmass. It is bordered on the southeast and east by the Mediterranean Sea, and on the north, west, and southwest by the Atlantic Ocean. The Pyrenees mountains are situated along the northeast edge of the peninsula, where it adjoins the rest of Europe. Its southern tip, located in Tarifa is the southernmost point of the European continent and is very close to the northwest coast of Africa, separated from it by the Strait of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean Sea.

The Iberian Peninsula encompasses 583,254¬†km2 and has very contrasting and uneven relief. The mountain ranges of the Iberian Peninsula are mainly distributed from west to east, and in some cases reach altitudes of approximately 3000 mamsl, resulting in the region having the second highest mean altitude (637 mamsl) in Western Europe.

The Iberian Peninsula extends from the southernmost extremity at Punta de Tarifa to the northernmost extremity at Punta de Estaca de Bares over a distance between lines of latitude of about based on a degree length of per degree, and from the westernmost extremity at Cabo da Roca to the easternmost extremity at Cap de Creus over a distance between lines of longitude at 40¬∞ N latitude of about based on an estimated degree length of about for that latitude. The irregular, roughly octagonal shape of the peninsula contained within this spherical quadrangle was compared by the geographer Strabo. to an ox-hide.

About three quarters of that rough octagon is the Meseta Central, a vast plateau ranging from 610 to 760 m in altitude. It is located approximately in the centre, staggered slightly to the east and tilted slightly toward the west (the conventional centre of the Iberian Peninsula has long been considered Getafe just south of Madrid). It is ringed by mountains and contains the sources of most of the rivers, which find their way through gaps in the mountain barriers on all sides.

===Coastline===

The coastline of the Iberian Peninsula is , on the Mediterranean side and on the Atlantic side. The coast has been inundated over time, with sea levels having risen from a minimum of lower than today at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to its current level at 4,000 years BP. The coastal shelf created by sedimentation during that time remains below the surface; however, it was never very extensive on the Atlantic side, as the continental shelf drops rather steeply into the depths. An estimated length of Atlantic shelf is only wide. At the isobath, on the edge, the shelf drops off to .

The submarine topography of the coastal waters of the Iberian Peninsula has been studied extensively in the process of drilling for oil. Ultimately, the shelf drops into the Bay of Biscay on the north (an abyss), the Iberian abyssal plain at on the west, and Tagus abyssal plain to the south. In the north, between the continental shelf and the abyss, is an extension called the Galicia Bank, a plateau that also contains the Porto, Vigo, and Vasco da Gama seamounts, which form the Galicia interior basin. The southern border of these features is marked by Nazar√© Canyon, which splits the continental shelf and leads directly into the abyss.

===Rivers===

The major rivers flow through the wide valleys between the mountain systems. These are the Ebro, Douro, Tagus, Guadiana and Guadalquivir. All rivers in the Iberian Peninsula are subject to seasonal variations in flow.

The Tagus is the longest river on the peninsula and, like the Douro, flows westwards with its lower course in Portugal. The Guadiana river bends southwards and forms the border between Spain and Portugal in the last stretch of its course.

===Mountains===
The terrain of the Iberian Peninsula is largely mountainous. The major mountain systems are:
* The Pyrenees and their foothills, the Pre-Pyrenees, crossing the isthmus of the peninsula so completely as to allow no passage except by mountain road, trail, coastal road or tunnel. Aneto in the Maladeta massif, at 3,404 m, is the highest point

* The Cantabrian Mountains along the northern coast with the massive Picos de Europa. Torre de Cerredo, at 2,648 m, is the highest point
* The Galicia/Tr√°s-os-Montes Massif in the Northwest is made up of very old heavily eroded rocks. Pena Trevinca, at 2,127 m, is the highest point
* The Sistema Ib√©rico, a complex system at the heart of the peninsula, in its central/eastern region. It contains a great number of ranges and divides the watershed of the Tagus, Douro and Ebro rivers. Moncayo, at 2,313 m, is the highest point
* The Sistema Central, dividing the Iberian Plateau into a northern and a southern half and stretching into Portugal (where the highest point of Continental Portugal (1,993 m) is located in the Serra da Estrela). Pico Almanzor in the Sierra de Gredos is the highest point, at 2,592 m
* The Montes de Toledo, which also stretches into Portugal from the La Mancha natural region at the eastern end. Its highest point, at 1,603 m, is La Villuerca in the Sierra de Villuercas, Extremadura
* The Sierra Morena, which divides the watershed of the Guadiana and Guadalquivir rivers. At 1,332 m, Ba√±uela is the highest point
* The Baetic System, which stretches between C√°diz and Gibraltar and northeast towards Alicante Province. It is divided into three subsystems:
** Prebaetic System, which begins west of the Sierra Sur de Ja√©n, reaching the Mediterranean Sea shores in Alicante Province. La Sagra is the highest point at 2,382 m.
** Subbaetic System, which is in a central position within the Baetic Systems, stretching from Cape Trafalgar in C√°diz Province across Andalusia to the Region of Murcia. The highest point, at , is Pe√±a de la Cruz in Sierra Arana.
** Penibaetic System, located in the far southeastern area stretching between Gibraltar across the Mediterranean coastal Andalusian provinces. It includes the highest point in the peninsula, the 3,478 m high Mulhac√©n in the Sierra Nevada.

===Geology===
The Iberian Peninsula contains rocks of every geological period from the Ediacaran to the Recent, and almost every kind of rock is represented. World-class mineral deposits can also be found there. The core of the Iberian Peninsula consists of a Hercynian cratonic block known as the Iberian Massif. On the northeast, this is bounded by the Pyrenean fold belt, and on the southeast it is bounded by the Baetic System. These twofold chains are part of the Alpine belt. To the west, the peninsula is delimited by the continental boundary formed by the magma-poor opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Hercynian Foldbelt is mostly buried by Mesozoic and Tertiary cover rocks to the east, but nevertheless outcrops through the Sistema Ib√©rico and the Catalan Mediterranean System.

The Iberian Peninsula features one of the largest lithium deposits belts in Europe (an otherwise relatively scarce resource in the continent), scattered along the Iberian Massif&#x27;s and . Also in the Iberian Massif, and similarly to other Hercynian blocks in Europe, the peninsula hosts some uranium deposits, largely located in the Central Iberian Zone unit.

The Iberian Pyrite Belt, located in the SW quadrant of the Peninsula, ranks among the most important volcanogenic massive sulphide districts on Earth, and it has been exploited for millennia.

===Climate===
The Iberian Peninsula&#x27;s location and topography, as well as the effects of large atmospheric circulation patterns induce a NW to SE gradient of yearly precipitation (roughly from 2,000¬†mm to 300¬†mm).

The Iberian Peninsula has three dominant climate types. One of these is the oceanic climate seen in the northeast in which precipitation has barely any difference between winter and summer. However, most of Portugal and Spain have a Mediterranean climate; the warm-summer Mediterranean climate and the hot-summer Mediterranean climate, with various differences in precipitation and temperature depending on latitude and position versus the sea, this applies greatly to the Portuguese and Galician Atlantic coasts where, due to upwelling/downwelling phenomena average temperatures in summer can vary through as much as 10¬†¬∞C (18¬†¬∞F) in only a few kilometers (e.g. Peniche vs Santar√©m) There are also more localized steppe climates in central Spain, with temperatures resembling a more continental Mediterranean climate. In other extreme cases highland alpine climates such as in Sierra Nevada and areas with extremely low precipitation and desert climates or semi-desert climates such as the Almer√≠a area, Murcia area and southern Alicante area. In the southwestern interior of the Iberian Peninsula the hottest temperatures in Europe are found, with C√≥rdoba and Alcoutim, in southeast Portugal, averaging around in July. The Spanish Mediterranean coast usually averages around in summer. In sharp contrast A Coru√±a at the northern tip of Galicia has a summer daytime high average at just below . This cool and wet summer climate is replicated throughout most of the northern coastline. Winters in the Peninsula are for the most part, mild, although frosts are common in higher altitude areas of central Spain. The warmest winter nights are usually found in downwelling favourable areas of the west coast, such as on capes. Precipitation varies greatly between regions on the Peninsula, in December for example the northern west coast averages above whereas the southeast can average below . Insolation can vary from just 1,600 hours in the Bilbao area, to above 3,000 hours in the Algarve and Gulf of C√°diz.

== Political divisions ==
The current political configuration of the Iberian Peninsula comprises the bulk of Portugal and Spain, the whole landlocked microstate of Andorra, a small part of the French department of Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales (French Cerdagne), and the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar.

French Cerdagne is on the south side of the Pyrenees mountain range, which runs along the border between France and Spain. For example, the Segre river, which runs west and then south to meet the Ebro, has its source on the French side. The Pyrenees range is often considered the northeastern boundary of Iberian Peninsula, although the French coastline curves away from the rest of Europe north of the range, which is the reason why Perpignan, which is also known as the capital of Northern Catalonia, is often considered as the entrance to the Iberian Peninsula.

Regarding Portugal and Spain, this chiefly excludes the Macaronesian archipelagos (the Azores and Madeira of Portugal, and the Canary Islands of Spain), the Balearic Islands (Spain), and the Spanish overseas territories in North Africa (most conspicuously the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, as well as unpopulated islets and rocks).

The countries and territories on the Iberian Peninsula:

== Cities ==
The Iberian city network is dominated by three international metropolises (Barcelona, Lisbon, and Madrid) and four regional metropolises (Bilbao, Porto, Seville, and Valencia). The relatively weak integration of the network favours a competitive approach vis-√†-vis the inter-relation between the different centres. Among these metropolises, Madrid stands out within the global urban hierarchy in terms of its status as a major service centre and enjoys the greatest degree of connectivity.

===Major metropolitan regions===
According to Eurostat (2019), the metropolitan regions with a population over one million are listed as follows:

==Ecology==

===Forests===
The woodlands of the Iberian Peninsula are distinct ecosystems. Although the various regions are each characterized by distinct vegetation, there are some similarities across the peninsula.

While the borders between these regions are not clearly defined, there is a mutual influence that makes it very hard to establish boundaries and some species find their optimal habitat in the intermediate areas.

The endangered Iberian lynx (&quot;Lynx pardinus&quot;) is a symbol of the Iberian mediterranean forest and of the fauna of the Iberian Peninsula altogether.

A new &quot;Podarcis&quot; lizard species, &quot;Podarcis virescens&quot;, was accepted as a species by the Taxonomic Committee of the &quot;Societas Europaea Herpetologica&quot; in 2020. This lizard is native to the Iberian Peninsula and found near rivers in the region.

===East Atlantic flyway===
The Iberian Peninsula is an important stopover on the East Atlantic flyway for birds migrating from northern Europe to Africa. For example, curlew sandpipers rest in the region of the Bay of C√°diz.

In addition to the birds migrating through, some seven million wading birds from the north spend the winter in the estuaries and wetlands of the Iberian Peninsula, mainly at locations on the Atlantic coast. In Galicia are R√≠a de Arousa (a home of grey plover), Ria de Ortigueira, Ria de Corme and Ria de Laxe. In Portugal, the Aveiro Lagoon hosts pied avocet, the common ringed plover, grey plover and little stint. Ribatejo Province on the Tagus supports pied avocet, grey plover, dunlin, bar-tailed godwit and common redshank. The Sado Estuary holds dunlin, Eurasian curlew, grey plover and common redshank. The Algarve hosts red knot, common greenshank and turnstone. The Guadalquivir Marshes region of Andalusia and the Salinas de C√°diz are especially rich in wintering wading birds: Kentish plover, common ringed plover, sanderling, and black-tailed godwit in addition to the others. And finally, the Ebro delta is home to all the species mentioned above.

==Languages==


With the sole exception of Basque, which is of unknown origin, all modern Iberian languages descend from Vulgar Latin and belong to the Western Romance languages. Throughout history (and pre-history), many different languages have been spoken in the Iberian Peninsula, contributing to the formation and differentiation of the contemporaneous languages of Iberia; however, most of them have become extinct or fallen into disuse. Basque is the only non-Indo-European surviving language in Iberia and Western Europe.

In modern times, Spanish (the official language of Spain, spoken by the entire 45¬†million population in the country, the native language of about 36¬†million in Europe), Portuguese (the official language of Portugal, with a population over 10¬†million), Catalan (over 7¬†million speakers in Europe, 3.4¬†million with Catalan as first language), Galician (understood by the 93% of the 2.8¬†million Galician population) and Basque (cf. around 1¬†million speakers) are the most widely spoken languages in the Iberian Peninsula. Spanish and Portuguese have expanded beyond Iberia to the rest of world, becoming global languages.

Other minority romance languages with some degree of recognition include the several varieties of Astur-leonese, collectively amounting to about 0.6¬†million speakers, and the Aragonese (barely spoken by the 8% of the 130,000 people inhabiting the Alto Arag√≥n).

English is the official language of Gibraltar. Llanito is a unique language in the territory, an amalgamation of mostly English and Spanish. In Spain, only 54.3% could speak a foreign language, below that of the EU-28 average. Portugal meanwhile achieved 69%, above the EU average, but still below the EU median. Spain ranks 25th out of 33 European countries in the English Proficiency Index.

== Transportation ==
Both Spain and Portugal have traditionally used a non-standard rail gauge (the 1,668¬†mm Iberian gauge) since the construction of the first railroads in the 19th century. Spain has progressively introduced the 1,435¬†mm standard gauge in its new high-speed rail network (one of the most extensive in the world), inaugurated in 1992 with the Madrid‚ÄìSeville line, followed to name a few by the Madrid‚ÄìBarcelona (2008), Madrid‚ÄìValencia (2010), an Alicante branch of the latter (2013) and the connection to France of the Barcelona line. Portugal however suspended all the high-speed rail projects in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, putting an end for the time being to the possibility of a high-speed rail connection between Lisbon, Porto and Madrid.

Handicapped by a mountainous range (the Pyrenees) hindering the connection to the rest of Europe, Spain (and subsidiarily Portugal) only has two meaningful rail connections to France able for freight transport, located at both ends of the mountain range. An international rail line across the Central Pyrenees linking Zaragoza and the French city of Pau through a tunnel existed in the past; however, an accident in the French part destroyed a stretch of the railroad in 1970 and the Canfranc Station has been a cul-de-sac since then.

There are four points connecting the Portuguese and Spanish rail networks: Valen√ßa do Minho‚ÄìTui, Vilar Formoso‚ÄìFuentes de O√±oro, Marv√£o-Beir√£‚ÄìValencia de Alc√°ntara and Elvas‚ÄìBadajoz.

The prospect of the development (as part of a European-wide effort) of the Central, Mediterranean and Atlantic rail corridors is expected to be a way to improve the competitiveness of the ports of Tarragona, Valencia, Sagunto, Bilbao, Santander, Sines and Algeciras vis-√†-vis the rest of Europe and the World.

In 1980, Morocco and Spain started a joint study on the feasibility of a fixed link (tunnel or bridge) across the Strait of Gibraltar, possibly through a connection of with Cape Malabata. Years of studies have, however, made no real progress thus far.

A transit point for many submarine cables, the Fibre-optic Link Around the Globe, Europe India Gateway, and the SEA-ME-WE 3 feature landing stations in the Iberian Peninsula. The West Africa Cable System, Main One, SAT-3/WASC, Africa Coast to Europe also land in Portugal. MAREA, a high capacity communication transatlantic cable, connects the north of the Iberian Peninsula (Bilbao) to North America (Virginia), whereas Grace Hopper is an upcoming cable connecting the Iberian Peninsula (Bilbao) to the UK and the US intended to be operative by 2022 and EllaLink is an upcoming high-capacity communication cable expected to connect the Peninsula (Sines) to South America and the mammoth 2Africa project intends to connect the peninsula to the United Kingdom, Europe and Africa (via Portugal and Barcelona) by 2023‚Äì24.

Two gas pipelines: the Pedro Duran Farell pipeline and (more recently) the Medgaz (from, respectively, Morocco and Algeria) link the Maghreb and the Iberian Peninsula, providing Spain with Algerian natural gas. However the contract for the first pipeline expires on 31 October 2021 and‚Äîamidst a tense climate of Algerian‚ÄìMoroccan relations‚Äîthere are no plans to renew it.

== Economy ==
The official currency across Iberia is the Euro, with the exception of Gibraltar, which uses the Gibraltar Pound (at parity with Sterling).

Major industries include mining, tourism, small farms, and fishing. Because the coast is so long, fishing is popular, especially sardines, tuna and anchovies. Most of the mining occurs in the Pyrenees mountains. Commodities mined include: iron, gold, coal, lead, silver, zinc, and salt.

Regarding their role in the global economy, both the microstate of Andorra and the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar have been described as tax havens.

The Galician region of Spain, in the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula, became one of the biggest entry points of cocaine in Europe, on a par with the Dutch ports. Hashish is smuggled from Morocco via the Strait of Gibraltar.

<doc id="14884" wikidata="Q245098" url="?curid=14884" title="Intermediate value theorem">
<text>In mathematical analysis, the intermediate value theorem states that if formula_1 is a continuous function whose domain contains the interval , then it takes on any given value between formula_2 and formula_3 at some point within the interval.

This has two important corollaries:

# If a continuous function has values of opposite sign inside an interval, then it has a root in that interval (Bolzano&#x27;s theorem). 
# The image of a continuous function over an interval is itself an interval.

==Motivation==
This captures an intuitive property of continuous functions over the real numbers: given &quot;formula_1&quot; continuous on formula_5 with the known values formula_6 and formula_7, then the graph of formula_8 must pass through the horizontal line formula_9 while formula_10 moves from formula_11 to formula_12. It represents the idea that the graph of a continuous function on a closed interval can be drawn without lifting a pencil from the paper.

==Theorem==
The intermediate value theorem states the following:

Consider an interval formula_13 of real numbers formula_14 and a continuous function formula_15. Then

*&quot;Version I.&quot; if formula_16 is a number between formula_2 and formula_3, that is, formula_19 such that formula_20.
*&quot;Version II.&quot; the image set formula_21 is also a closed interval, and it contains formula_22.

Remark: &quot;Version II&quot; states that the set of function values has no gap. For any two function values formula_23 with formula_24 all points in the interval formula_25 are also function values, formula_26
A subset of the real numbers with no internal gap is an interval. &quot;Version I&quot; is naturally contained in &quot;Version II&quot;.

==Relation to completeness==
The theorem depends on, and is equivalent to, the completeness of the real numbers. The intermediate value theorem does not apply to the rational numbers Q because gaps exist between rational numbers; irrational numbers fill those gaps. For example, the function formula_27 for formula_28 satisfies formula_29 and formula_30. However, there is no rational number formula_10 such that formula_32, because formula_33 is an irrational number.

Despite the above, there is a version of the intermediate value theorem for polynomials over a real closed field; see the Weierstrass Nullstellensatz.

==Proof==
=== Proof version A===

The theorem may be proven as a consequence of the completeness property of the real numbers as follows:

We shall prove the first case, formula_34. The second case is similar.

Let formula_35 be the set of all formula_36 such that &lt;math&gt;f(x). Then formula_35 is non-empty since formula_38 is an element of formula_35. Since formula_35 is non-empty and bounded above by formula_41, by completeness, the supremum formula_42 exists. That is, formula_43 is the smallest number that is greater than or equal to every member of formula_35.

Note that, due to the continuity of formula_1 at formula_38, we can keep formula_47 within any formula_48 of formula_2 by keeping formula_10 sufficiently close to formula_38. Since formula_52 is the distance between formula_16 and formula_2. No formula_10 sufficiently close to formula_38 can then make formula_47 greater than or equal to formula_16, which means there are values greater than formula_38 in formula_35. A more detailed proof goes like this:

Choose formula_61. Then formula_62 such that formula_63, formula_64. Notice that formula_65 and every formula_66 satisfies the condition formula_67. Therefore for every formula_66 we have &lt;math&gt;f(x). Hence formula_43 cannot be formula_38.

Likewise, due to the continuity of formula_1 at formula_41, we can keep formula_47 within any formula_74 of formula_3 by keeping formula_10 sufficiently close to formula_41. Since formula_78 is a strict inequality, consider the similar implication when formula_79 is the distance between formula_16 and formula_3. Every formula_10 sufficiently close to formula_41 must then make formula_47 greater than formula_16, which means there are values smaller than formula_41 that are upper bounds of formula_35. A more detailed proof goes like this:

Choose formula_88. Then formula_62 such that formula_63, formula_91Consider the interval formula_92. Notice that formula_93 and every formula_94 satisfies the condition formula_95. Therefore for every formula_94 we have formula_97. Hence formula_43 cannot be formula_41.

With formula_100 and formula_101, it must be the case formula_102. Now we claim that formula_20.

Fix some formula_74. Since formula_1 is continuous at formula_43, formula_107 such that formula_63, formula_109.

Since formula_102 and formula_111 is open, formula_112 such that formula_113. Set formula_114. Then we have
formula_115
for all formula_116. By the properties of the supremum, there exists some formula_117 that is contained in formula_35, and so
formula_119, we know that formula_120 because formula_43 is the supremum of formula_35. This means that
formula_123
Both inequalities
formula_124
are valid for all formula_74, from which we deduce formula_126 as the only possible value, as stated.

===Proof version B===
We will only prove the case of formula_127 case is similar.

Define formula_128 which is equivalent to formula_129 and lets us rewrite formula_130, and we have to prove, that formula_131 for some formula_132, which is more intuitive. We further define the set formula_133. Because formula_134 we know, that formula_135 so, that formula_35 is not empty. Moreover, as formula_137, we know that formula_35 is bounded and non-empty, so by Completeness, the supremum formula_139 exists.

There are 3 cases for the value of formula_140, those being formula_141 and formula_131. For contradiction, let us assume, that formula_143. Then, by the definition of continuity, for formula_144, there exists a formula_145 such that formula_116 implies, that formula_147, which is equivalent to formula_148. If we just chose formula_149, where formula_150, then as formula_151, formula_152, from which we get formula_148 and formula_154. It follows that formula_10 is an upper bound for formula_35. However, formula_157, contradicting the upper bound property of the &quot;least upper bound&quot; formula_43, so formula_159. Assume then, that formula_160. We similarly chose formula_161 and know, that there exists a formula_145 such that formula_116 implies formula_164. We can rewrite this as formula_165 which implies, that formula_166. If we now chose formula_167, then formula_166 and formula_169. It follows that formula_10 is an upper bound for formula_35. However, formula_172, which contradict the least property of the &quot;least upper bound&quot; formula_43, which means, that formula_160 is impossible. If we combine both results, we get that formula_131 or formula_20 is the only remaining possibility.

Remark: The intermediate value theorem can also be proved using the methods of non-standard analysis, which places &quot;intuitive&quot; arguments involving infinitesimals on a rigorous footing.

==History==
A form of the theorem was postulated as early as the 5th century BCE, in the work of Bryson of Heraclea on squaring the circle. Bryson argued that, as circles larger than and smaller than a given square both exist, there must exist a circle of equal area. The theorem was first proved by Bernard Bolzano in 1817. Bolzano used the following formulation of the theorem:

Let formula_177 be continuous functions on the interval between formula_178 and formula_179 such that formula_180 and formula_181. Then there is an formula_10 between formula_178 and formula_179 such that formula_185.

The equivalence between this formulation and the modern one can be shown by setting formula_186 to the appropriate constant function. Augustin-Louis Cauchy provided the modern formulation and a proof in 1821. Both were inspired by the goal of formalizing the analysis of functions and the work of Joseph-Louis Lagrange. The idea that continuous functions possess the intermediate value property has an earlier origin. Simon Stevin proved the intermediate value theorem for polynomials (using a cubic as an example) by providing an algorithm for constructing the decimal expansion of the solution. The algorithm iteratively subdivides the interval into 10 parts, producing an additional decimal digit at each step of the iteration. Before the formal definition of continuity was given, the intermediate value property was given as part of the definition of a continuous function. Proponents include Louis Arbogast, who assumed the functions to have no jumps, satisfy the intermediate value property and have increments whose sizes corresponded to the sizes of the increments of the variable.
Earlier authors held the result to be intuitively obvious and requiring no proof. The insight of Bolzano and Cauchy was to define a general notion of continuity (in terms of infinitesimals in Cauchy&#x27;s case and using real inequalities in Bolzano&#x27;s case), and to provide a proof based on such definitions.

==Converse is false==

A Darboux function is a real-valued function that has the &quot;intermediate value property,&quot; i.e., that satisfies the conclusion of the intermediate value theorem: for any two values and in the domain of , and any between and , there is some between and with . The intermediate value theorem says that every continuous function is a Darboux function. However, not every Darboux function is continuous; i.e., the converse of the intermediate value theorem is false.

As an example, take the function defined by for and . This function is not continuous at because the limit of as tends to 0 does not exist; yet the function has the intermediate value property. Another, more complicated example is given by the Conway base 13 function.

In fact, Darboux&#x27;s theorem states that all functions that result from the differentiation of some other function on some interval have the intermediate value property (even though they need not be continuous).

Historically, this intermediate value property has been suggested as a definition for continuity of real-valued functions; this definition was not adopted.

==Generalizations==

=== Multi-dimensional spaces ===
The Poincar√©-Miranda theorem is a generalization of the Intermediate value theorem from a (one-dimensional) interval to a (two-dimensional) rectangle, or more generally, to an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional cube.

Vrahatis presents a similar generalization to triangles, or more generally, &quot;n&quot;-dimensional simplices. Let &quot;Dn&quot; be an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional simplex with &quot;n&quot;+1 vertices denoted by &quot;v&quot;0...,&quot;vn&quot;. Let &quot;F&quot;=(&quot;f&quot;1...,&quot;fn&quot;) be a continuous function from &quot;Dn&quot; to &quot;Rn&quot;, that never equals 0 on the boundary of &quot;Dn&quot;. Suppose &quot;F&quot; satisfies the following conditions:

* For all &quot;i&quot; in 1...,&quot;n&quot;, the sign of &quot;fi&quot;(&quot;vi&quot;) is opposite to the sign of &quot;fi&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for all points &quot;x&quot; on the face opposite to &quot;vi&quot;;
* The sign-vector of &quot;f&quot;1...,&quot;fn&quot; on &quot;v&quot;0 is not equal to the sign-vector of &quot;f&quot;1...,&quot;fn&quot; on all points on the face opposite to &quot;v0&quot;.

Then there is a point &quot;z&quot; in the interior of &quot;Dn&quot; on which &quot;F&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)=(0...,0).

It is possible to normalize the &quot;fi&quot; such that &quot;fi&quot;(&quot;vi&quot;)&gt;0 for all &quot;i&quot;; then the conditions become simpler:

*For all &quot;i&quot; in 1...,&quot;n&quot;, &quot;fi&quot;(&quot;vi&quot;)&gt;0, and &quot;fi&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&lt;0 for all points &quot;x&quot; on the face opposite to &quot;vi&quot;. In particular, &quot;fi&quot;(&quot;v0&quot;)&lt;0.
*For all points &quot;x&quot; on the face opposite to &quot;v0&quot;, &quot;fi&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&gt;0 for at least one &quot;i&quot; in 1...,&quot;n.&quot;
The theorem can be proved based on the Knaster‚ÄìKuratowski‚ÄìMazurkiewicz lemma. In can be used for approximations of fixed points and zeros.

=== General metric and topological spaces ===
The intermediate value theorem is closely linked to the topological notion of connectedness and follows from the basic properties of connected sets in metric spaces and connected subsets of R in particular:
* If formula_187 and formula_188 are metric spaces, formula_189 is a continuous map, and formula_190 is a connected subset, then formula_191 is connected. () 
* A subset formula_192 is connected if and only if it satisfies the following property: formula_193. ()

In fact, connectedness is a topological property and generalizes to topological spaces: &quot;If formula_187 and formula_188 are topological spaces, formula_189 is a continuous map, and formula_187 is a connected space, then formula_198 is connected.&quot; The preservation of connectedness under continuous maps can be thought of as a generalization of the intermediate value theorem, a property of continuous, real-valued functions of a real variable, to continuous functions in general spaces.

Recall the first version of the intermediate value theorem, stated previously:

The intermediate value theorem is an immediate consequence of these two properties of connectedness:

The intermediate value theorem generalizes in a natural way: Suppose that is a connected topological space and is a totally ordered set equipped with the order topology, and let be a continuous map. If and are two points in and is a point in lying between and with respect to , then there exists in such that . The original theorem is recovered by noting that is connected and that its natural topology is the order topology.

The Brouwer fixed-point theorem is a related theorem that, in one dimension, gives a special case of the intermediate value theorem.

==In constructive mathematics==

In constructive mathematics, the intermediate value theorem is not true. Instead, one has to weaken the conclusion:

* Let formula_38 and formula_41 be real numbers and formula_201 be a pointwise continuous function from the closed interval formula_202 to the real line, and suppose that formula_203 and formula_204. Then for every positive number formula_74 there exists a point formula_10 in the unit interval such that formula_207.

==Practical applications==
A similar result is the Borsuk‚ÄìUlam theorem, which says that a continuous map from the formula_208-sphere to Euclidean formula_208-space will always map some pair of antipodal points to the same place.

In general, for any continuous function whose domain is some closed convex shape and any point inside the shape (not necessarily its center), there exist two antipodal points with respect to the given point whose functional value is the same.

The theorem also underpins the explanation of why rotating a wobbly table will bring it to stability (subject to certain easily met constraints).

<doc id="14889" wikidata="Q82664" url="?curid=14889" title="Iran‚ÄìIraq War">
<text>The Iran‚ÄìIraq War, also known as the First Gulf War, was an armed conflict between Iran and Iraq that lasted from September 1980 to August 1988. Active hostilities began with the Iraqi invasion of Iran and lasted for nearly eight years, until the acceptance of United Nations Security Council Resolution 598 by both sides. Iraq&#x27;s primary rationale for the attack against Iran cited the need to prevent Ruhollah Khomeini‚Äîwho had spearheaded the Iranian revolution in 1979‚Äîfrom exporting the new Iranian ideology to Iraq. There were also fears among the Iraqi leadership of Saddam Hussein that Iran, a theocratic state with a population predominantly composed of Shia Muslims, would exploit sectarian tensions in Iraq by rallying Iraq&#x27;s Shia majority against the Ba Ωathist government, which was officially secular but dominated by Sunni Muslims. Iraq also wished to replace Iran as the power player in the Persian Gulf, which was not seen as an achievable objective prior to the Islamic Revolution because of Pahlavi Iran&#x27;s economic and military superiority as well as its close relationships with the United States and Israel.

The Iran‚ÄìIraq War followed a long-running history of territorial border disputes between the two states, as a result of which Iraq planned to retake the eastern bank of the Shatt al-Arab that it had ceded to Iran in the 1975 Algiers Agreement. Iraqi support for Arab separatists in Iran increased following the outbreak of hostilities; Saddam disputedly may have wished to annex Iran&#x27;s Arab-majority Khuzestan province.

While the Iraqi leadership had hoped to take advantage of Iran&#x27;s post-revolutionary chaos and expected a decisive victory in the face of a severely weakened Iran, the Iraqi military only made progress for three months, and by December 1980, the Iraqi invasion had stalled. The Iranian military began to gain momentum against the Iraqis and regained all lost territory by June 1982. After pushing Iraqi forces back to the pre-war border lines, Iran rejected United Nations Security Council Resolution 514 and launched an invasion of Iraq. The subsequent Iranian offensive within Iraqi territory lasted for five years, with Iraq taking back the initiative in mid-1988 and subsequently launching a series of major counter-offensives that ultimately led to the conclusion of the war in a stalemate.

The eight years of war-exhaustion, economic devastation, decreased morale, military stalemate, inaction by the international community towards the use of weapons of mass destruction by Iraqi forces on Iranian soldiers and civilians, as well as increasing Iran‚ÄìUnited States military tensions all culminated in Iran&#x27;s acceptance of a ceasefire brokered by the United Nations Security Council. In total, around 500,000 people were killed during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, with Iran bearing the larger share of the casualties, excluding the tens of thousands of civilians killed in the concurrent Anfal campaign that targeted Iraqi Kurdistan. The end of the conflict resulted in neither reparations nor border changes, and the combined financial losses suffered by both combatants is believed to have exceeded . There were a number of proxy forces operating for both countries: Iraq and the pro-Iraqi Arab separatist militias in Iran were most notably supported by the National Council of Resistance of Iran; whereas Iran re-established an alliance with the Iraqi Kurds, being primarily supported by the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. During the conflict, Iraq received an abundance of financial, political, and logistical aid from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, Italy, Yugoslavia, and the overwhelming majority of Arab countries. While Iran was comparatively isolated, it received a significant amount of aid from Syria, Libya, China, North Korea, Israel, Pakistan, and South Yemen.

The conflict has been compared to World War I in terms of the tactics used by both sides, including large-scale trench warfare with barbed wire stretched across fortified defensive lines, manned machine-gun posts, bayonet charges, Iranian human wave attacks, Iraq&#x27;s extensive use of chemical weapons, and deliberate attacks on civilian targets. The discourses on martyrdom formulated in the Iranian Shia Islamic context led to the widespread usage of human wave attacks and thus had a lasting impact on the dynamics of the conflict.

==Background==
===Iran‚ÄìIraq relations===

In April 1969, Iran abrogated the 1937 treaty over the Shatt al-Arab and Iranian ships stopped paying tolls to Iraq when they used the Shatt al-Arab. The Shah argued that the 1937 treaty was unfair to Iran because almost all river borders around the world ran along the &quot;thalweg&quot;, and because most of the ships that used the Shatt al-Arab were Iranian. Iraq threatened war over the Iranian move, but on 24 April 1969, an Iranian tanker escorted by Iranian warships (Joint Operation Arvand) sailed down the Shatt al-Arab, and Iraq‚Äîbeing the militarily weaker state‚Äîdid nothing. The Iranian abrogation of the 1937 treaty marked the beginning of a period of acute Iraqi‚ÄìIranian tension that would see significant bloodshed and was to last until the Algiers Agreement of 1975.

The relationship between the governments of Iran and Iraq briefly improved in 1978, when Iranian agents in Iraq discovered plans for a pro-Soviet &quot;coup d&#x27;√©tat&quot; against Iraq&#x27;s government. When informed of this plot, Saddam ordered the execution of dozens of his army&#x27;s officers, and in a sign of reconciliation, expelled from Iraq Ruhollah Khomeini, an exiled leader of clerical opposition to the Shah.

===After the Iranian Revolution===
Tensions between Iraq and Iran were fuelled by Iran&#x27;s Islamic revolution and its appearance of being a Pan-Islamic force, in contrast to Iraq&#x27;s Arab nationalism. Despite Iraq&#x27;s goal of regaining the Shatt al-Arab, the Iraqi government initially seemed to welcome the Iranian revolution, which overthrew Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was seen as a common enemy. There were frequent clashes along the Iran‚ÄìIraq border throughout 1980, with Iraq publicly complaining of at least 544 incidents and Iran citing at least 797 violations of its border and airspace.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on Iraqis to overthrow the Ba&#x27;ath government, which was received with considerable anger in Baghdad. On 17 July 1979, despite Khomeini&#x27;s call, Saddam gave a speech praising the Iranian Revolution and called for an Iraqi‚ÄìIranian friendship based on non-interference in each other&#x27;s internal affairs. When Khomeini rejected Saddam&#x27;s overture by calling for Islamic revolution in Iraq, Saddam was alarmed. Iran&#x27;s new Islamic administration was regarded in Baghdad as an irrational, existential threat to the Ba&#x27;ath government, especially because the Ba&#x27;ath party, having a secular nature, discriminated against and posed a threat to the fundamentalist Shia movement in Iraq, whose clerics were Iran&#x27;s allies within Iraq and whom Khomeini saw as oppressed.

On 1 April 1980, the Islamic Dawa Party, an Iraqi Islamist group with supportive ties to Iran, attempted to assassinate Tariq Aziz, a high ranking Ba&#x27;athist and Iraq&#x27;s deputy prime minister, in retaliation for a 30 March decree declaring &quot;membership of Dawa [to be] a capital offense&quot;. The attempt failed and instead killed several civilians. This failed assassination plot, carried out by an Iran-backed group, formed a part of Iraq&#x27;s casus belli for the invasion of Iran. Iraq&#x27;s immediate response was to order the execution of Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, an Iraqi Shi&#x27;ite cleric seen as the public face of the Dawa movement, along with al-Sadr&#x27;s sister. On 30 April, Iraq organized an attack on the Iranian embassy in London.

Saddam&#x27;s primary interest in war may have also stemmed from his desire to right the supposed &quot;wrong&quot; of the Algiers Agreement, in addition to finally achieving his desire of becoming the regional superpower. Saddam&#x27;s goal was to supplant Egypt as the &quot;leader of the Arab world&quot; and to achieve hegemony over the Persian Gulf. He saw Iran&#x27;s increased weakness due to revolution, sanctions, and international isolation. Saddam had invested heavily in Iraq&#x27;s military since his defeat against Iran in 1975, buying large amounts of weaponry from the Soviet Union and France. Between 1973 and 1980 alone, Iraq purchased an estimated 1,600 tanks and APCs and over 200 Soviet-made aircraft.

By 1980, Iraq possessed 242,000 soldiers, second only to Egypt in the Arab world, 2,350 tanks and 340 combat aircraft. Watching the disintegration of the powerful Iranian army that frustrated him in 1974‚Äì1975, he saw an opportunity to attack, using the threat of Islamic Revolution as a pretext. Iraqi military intelligence reported in July 1980 that despite Iran&#x27;s bellicose rhetoric, &quot;it is clear that, at present, Iran has no power to launch wide offensive operations against Iraq, or to defend on a large scale.&quot; Days before the Iraqi invasion and in the midst of rapidly escalating cross-border skirmishes, Iraqi military intelligence again reiterated on 14 September that &quot;the enemy deployment organization does not indicate hostile intentions and appears to be taking on a more defensive mode&quot;.

Some scholars writing prior to the opening of formerly classified Iraqi archives, such as Alistair Finlan, argued that Saddam was drawn into a conflict with Iran due to the border clashes and Iranian meddling in Iraqi domestic affairs. Finlan stated in 2003 that the Iraqi invasion was meant to be a limited operation in order to send a political message to the Iranians to keep out of Iraqi domestic affairs, whereas Kevin M. Woods and Williamson Murray stated in 2014 that the balance of evidence suggests Saddam was seeking &quot;a convenient excuse for war&quot; in 1980.

On 8 March 1980, Iran announced it was withdrawing its ambassador from Iraq, downgraded its diplomatic ties to the charge d&#x27;affaires level, and demanded that Iraq do the same. The following day, Iraq declared Iran&#x27;s ambassador persona non grata, and demanded his withdrawal from Iraq by 15 March.

===Iranian military preparations===

In Iran, severe officer purges, including numerous executions ordered by Sadegh Khalkhali, the new Revolutionary Court judge, and shortages of spare parts for Iran&#x27;s American and British-made equipment had crippled Iran&#x27;s once-mighty military. Between February and September 1979, Iran&#x27;s government executed 85 senior generals and forced all major-generals and most brigadier-generals into early retirement.

By September 1980, the revolutionary government had purged some 12,000 officers of all levels from the army. These purges resulted in a drastic decline in the Iranian military&#x27;s operational capacities.

On the eve of the revolution in 1978, international experts in military science had assessed that Iran&#x27;s armed forces were the fifth most powerful in the world. However, by the eve of war with Iraq, the recently formidable Iranian army was in many crucial ways a shell of its former self, having been badly weakened by losses in experienced personnel. The desertion rate had reached 60%, the officer corps was devastated and its most highly skilled soldiers and aviators had been exiled, imprisoned, or executed. When the invasion occurred, many pilots and officers were released from prison, or had their executions commuted to combat the Iraqis. Throughout the war, Iran never managed to fully recover from this flight of human capital.

Many junior officers were promoted to generals, resulting in the army being more integrated as a part of the regime by the war&#x27;s end. Meanwhile, a new paramilitary organisation gained prominence in Iran, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Created to protect the new regime and serve as a counterbalance to the army, the &quot;Revolutionary Guards&quot; (IRGC) had been trained to act only as a militia and struggled to adapt as needed following the Iraqi invasion, initially refusing to fight alongside the regular army, resulting in many defeats. It was not until 1982 that the two groups began carrying out combined operations.

An additional paramilitary militia was founded in response to the invasion, the &quot;Army of 20 Million&quot;, commonly known as the Basij. The Basij were poorly armed and had members as young as 12 and as old as 70. They often acted in conjunction with the Revolutionary Guard, launching so-called human wave attacks and other campaigns against the Iraqis. They were subordinate to the Revolutionary Guards, and they made up most of the manpower that was used in the Revolutionary Guard&#x27;s attacks.

Stephen Pelletiere wrote in his 1992 book &quot;The Iran‚ÄìIraq War: Chaos in a Vacuum&quot;:

Despite neglect by the new regime, at the outset of the conflict, Iran still had at least 1,000 operational tanks and several hundred functional aircraft and could cannibalize equipment to procure spare parts. Continuous sanctions greatly limited Iran from acquiring many additional heavy weapons, including tanks and aircraft.

===Iraqi military preparations===
In addition, the area around the Shatt al-Arab posed no obstacle for the Iraqis, as they possessed river crossing equipment. Iraq correctly deduced that Iran&#x27;s defences at the crossing points around the Karkheh and Karoun Rivers were undermanned and that the rivers could be easily crossed. Iraqi intelligence was also informed that the Iranian forces in Khuzestan province, which consisted of two divisions prior to the revolution, now only consisted of several ill-equipped and under-strength battalions. Only a handful of company-sized tank units remained operational.

The only qualms the Iraqis had were over the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (formerly the Imperial Iranian Air Force). Despite the purge of several key pilots and commanders, as well as the lack of spare parts, the air force showed its power during local uprisings and rebellions. They were also active after the failed U.S. attempt to rescue its hostages, Operation Eagle Claw. Based on these observations, Iraq&#x27;s leaders decided to carry out a surprise airstrike against the Iranian air force&#x27;s infrastructure prior to the main invasion.

=== Khuzestan ===
It is widely accepted among scholars that Iraq was seeking to annex, or at least to establish suzerainty over, Iran&#x27;s Khuzestan province, but Saddam Hussein publicly denied this in November 1980.

===Border conflicts leading up to the war===


On 10 September 1980, Iraq forcibly reclaimed territories in Zain al-Qaws and Saif Saad that it had been promised under the terms of the 1975 Algiers Agreement but that Iran had never handed over, leading to both Iran and Iraq declaring the treaty null and void, on 14 September and 17 September, respectively. As a result, the only outstanding border dispute between Iran and Iraq at the time of the Iraqi invasion of 22 September was the question of whether Iranian ships would fly Iraqi flags and pay Iraq navigation fees for a stretch of the Shatt al-Arab river spanning several miles.

==Course of the war==
===1980: Iraqi invasion===

Iraq launched a full-scale invasion of Iran on 22 September 1980. The Iraqi Air Force launched surprise air strikes on ten Iranian airfields with the objective of destroying the Iranian Air Force. The attack failed to cripple the Iranian Air Force: while it damaged some of Iran&#x27;s airbase infrastructure, it did not destroy a significant number of aircraft. The Iraqi Air Force was only able to strike in depth with a few MiG-23BN, Tu-22, and Su-20 aircraft, and Iran had built hardened aircraft shelters where most of its combat aircraft were stored.

The next day, Iraq launched a ground invasion, mounting three simultaneous attacks along a front. Saddam hoped an attack on Iran would cause such a blow to Iran&#x27;s prestige that it would lead to the new government&#x27;s downfall, or at least end Iran&#x27;s calls for his overthrow.

Of Iraq&#x27;s six divisions that invaded by ground, four were sent to Khuzestan, which was located near the border&#x27;s southern end, to cut off the Shatt al-Arab from the rest of Iran and to establish a territorial security zone. The other two divisions invaded across the northern and central part of the border to prevent an Iranian counter-attack. Two of the four Iraqi divisions, one mechanised and one armoured, operated near the southern end and began a siege of the strategically important port cities of Abadan and Khorramshahr.

The two armoured divisions secured the territory bounded by the cities of Khorramshahr, Ahvaz, Susangerd, and Musian. On the central front, the Iraqis occupied Mehran, advanced towards the foothills of the Zagros Mountains, and were able to block the traditional Tehran‚ÄìBaghdad invasion route by securing territory forward of Qasr-e Shirin, Iran. On the northern front, the Iraqis attempted to establish a strong defensive position opposite Suleimaniya to protect the Iraqi Kirkuk oil complex. Iraqi hopes of an uprising by the ethnic Arabs of Khuzestan failed to materialise, as most of the ethnic Arabs remained loyal to Iran.

The Iraqi troops advancing into Iran in 1980 were described by Patrick Brogan as &quot;badly led and lacking in offensive spirit&quot;. The first known chemical weapons attack by Iraq on Iran probably took place during the fighting around Susangerd. Adnan Khayr Allah served as Iraqi Minister of Defence throughout the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, and was appointed Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, second only to Saddam Hussein. In this position, he played a crucial role in rebuilding and modernizing the Iraqi military.
Though the Iraqi air invasion surprised the Iranians, the Iranian air force retaliated the day after with a large-scale attack against Iraqi air bases and infrastructure in Operation Kaman 99. Groups of F-4 Phantom and F-5 Tiger fighter jets attacked targets throughout Iraq, such as oil facilities, dams, petrochemical plants, and oil refineries, and included Mosul Airbase, Baghdad, and the Kirkuk oil refinery. Iraq was taken by surprise at the strength of the retaliation, which caused the Iraqis heavy losses and economic disruption, but the Iranians took heavy losses as well as losing many aircraft and aircrews to Iraqi air defenses.

Iranian Army Aviation&#x27;s AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships began attacks on the advancing Iraqi divisions, along with F-4 Phantoms armed with AGM-65 Maverick missiles; they destroyed numerous armoured vehicles and impeded the Iraqi advance, though not completely halting it. Meanwhile, Iraqi air attacks on Iran were repelled by Iran&#x27;s F-14A Tomcat interceptor fighter jets, using AIM-54A Phoenix missiles, which downed a dozen of Iraq&#x27;s Soviet-built fighters in the first two days of battle.

The Iranian regular military, police forces, volunteer Basij, and Revolutionary Guards all conducted their operations separately; thus, the Iraqi invading forces did not face coordinated resistance. However, on 24 September, the Iranian Navy attacked Basra, Iraq, destroying two oil terminals near the Iraqi port of Al-Faw, which reduced Iraq&#x27;s ability to export oil. The Iranian ground forces, primarily consisting of the Revolutionary Guard, retreated to the cities, where they set up defences against the invaders.

On 30 September, Iran&#x27;s air force launched Operation Scorch Sword, striking and badly damaging the nearly-complete Osirak Nuclear Reactor near Baghdad. By 1 October, Baghdad had been subjected to eight air attacks. In response, Iraq launched aerial strikes against Iranian targets.

The mountainous border between Iran and Iraq made a deep ground invasion almost impossible, and air strikes were used instead. The invasion&#x27;s first waves were a series of air strikes targeted at Iranian airfields. Iraq also attempted to bomb Tehran, Iran&#x27;s capital and command centre, into submission.

====First Battle of Khorramshahr====
On 22 September, a prolonged battle began in the city of Khorramshahr, eventually leaving around 7,000 dead on each side. Reflecting the bloody nature of the struggle, Iranians came to call Khorramshahr &quot;City of Blood&quot;.

The battle began with Iraqi air raids against key points and mechanised divisions advancing on the city in a crescent-like formation. They were slowed by Iranian air attacks and Revolutionary Guard troops with recoilless rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and Molotov cocktails. The Iranians flooded the marsh areas around the city, forcing the Iraqis to traverse through narrow strips of land. Iraqi tanks launched attacks with no infantry support, and many tanks were lost to Iranian anti-tank teams.

By 30 September, the Iraqis had managed to clear the Iranians from the outskirts of the city. The next day, the Iraqis launched infantry and armoured attacks into the city. After heavy house-to-house fighting, the Iraqis were repelled. On 14 October, the Iraqis launched a second offensive. The Iranians initiated a controlled withdrawal from the city, street by street. By 24 October, most of the city was captured, and the Iranians evacuated across the Karun River. Some partisans remained, and fighting continued until 10 November.

====Iraqi advance stalls====
Though Khorramshahr was captured, the battle had delayed the Iraqis enough to allow the large-scale deployment of the Iranian military. In November, Saddam ordered his forces to advance towards Dezful and Ahvaz, and lay sieges to both cities. However, the Iraqi offensive had been badly damaged by Iranian militias and air power. Iran&#x27;s air force had destroyed Iraq&#x27;s army supply depots and fuel supplies, and was strangling Iraq through an aerial siege.

Iran&#x27;s supplies had not been exhausted, despite sanctions, and the military often cannibalised spare parts from other equipment and began searching for parts on the black market. On 28 November, Iran launched Operation Morvarid (Pearl), a combined air and sea attack which destroyed 80% of Iraq&#x27;s navy and all of its radar sites in the southern portion of the country. When Iraq laid siege to Abadan and dug its troops in around the city, it was unable to blockade the port, which allowed Iran to resupply Abadan by sea.

Iraq&#x27;s strategic reserves had been depleted, and by now it lacked the power to go on any major offensives until nearly the end of the war. On 7 December, Hussein announced that Iraq was going on the defensive. By the end of 1980, Iraq had destroyed about 500 Western-built Iranian tanks and captured 100 others.

===1981: Stalemate===

For the next eight months, both sides were on a defensive footing, with the exception of the Battle of Dezful, as the Iranians needed more time to reorganise their forces after the damage inflicted by the purge of 1979‚Äì80. During this period, fighting consisted mainly of artillery duels and raids. Iraq had mobilised 21 divisions for the invasion, while Iran countered with only 13 regular army divisions and one brigade. Of the regular divisions, only seven were deployed to the border. The war bogged down into World War I-style trench warfare with tanks and modern late-20th century weapons. Due to the power of anti-tank weapons such as the RPG-7, armored manoeuvre by the Iraqis was very costly, and they consequently entrenched their tanks into static positions.

Iraq also began firing Scud missiles into Dezful and Ahvaz, and used terror bombing to bring the war to the Iranian civilian population. Iran launched dozens of &quot;human wave assaults&quot;.

====Battle of Dezful====


On 5 January 1981, Iran had reorganised its forces enough to launch a large-scale offensive, Operation Nasr (Victory). The Iranians launched their major armoured offensive from Dezful in the direction of Susangerd, consisting of tank brigades from the 16th &quot;Qazvin&quot;, 77th &quot;Khorasan&quot;, and 92nd Khuzestan Armoured Divisions, and broke through Iraqi lines. However, the Iranian tanks had raced through Iraqi lines with their flanks unprotected and with no infantry support; as a result, they were cut off by Iraqi tanks.

In the ensuing Battle of Dezful, the Iranian armoured divisions were nearly wiped out in one of the biggest tank battles of the war. When the Iranian tanks tried to manoeuvre, they became stuck in the mud of the marshes, and many tanks were abandoned. The Iraqis lost 45 T-55 and T-62 tanks, while the Iranians lost 100‚Äì200 Chieftain and M-60 tanks. Reporters counted roughly 150 destroyed or deserted Iranian tanks, and also 40 Iraqi tanks. 141 Iranians were killed during the battle.

The battle had been ordered by Iranian president Abulhassan Banisadr, who was hoping that a victory might shore up his deteriorating political position; instead, the failure hastened his fall. Many of Iran&#x27;s problems took place because of political infighting between President Banisadr, who supported the regular army, and the hardliners who supported the IRGC. Once he was impeached and the competition ended, the performance of the Iranian military improved.
The Islamic Republic government in Iran was further distracted by internal fighting between the regime and the Mujahedin e-Khalq (MEK) on the streets of Iran&#x27;s major cities in June 1981 and again in September. In 1983, the MEK started an alliance with Iraq following a meeting between MEK leader Massoud Rajavi and Iraqi Deputy Prime minister Tariq Aziz.

In 1984 Banisadr left the coalition because of a dispute with Rajavi. In 1986, Rajavi moved from Paris to Iraq and set up a base on the Iranian border. The Battle of Dezful became a critical battle in Iranian military thinking. Less emphasis was placed on the Army with its conventional tactics, and more emphasis was placed on the Revolutionary Guard with its unconventional tactics.

====Attack on H3====

The Iraqi Air Force, badly damaged by the Iranians, was moved to the H-3 Airbase in Western Iraq, near the Jordanian border and away from Iran. However, on 3 April 1981, the Iranian air force used eight F-4 Phantom fighter bombers, four F-14 Tomcats, three Boeing 707 refuelling tankers, and one Boeing 747 command plane to launch a surprise attack on H3, destroying 27‚Äì50 Iraqi fighter jets and bombers.

Despite the successful H-3 airbase attack (in addition to other air attacks), the Iranian Air Force was forced to cancel its successful 180-day air offensive. In addition, they abandoned their attempted control of Iranian airspace. They had been seriously weakened by sanctions and pre-war purges and further damaged by a fresh purge after the impeachment crisis of President Banisadr. The Iranian Air Force could not survive further attrition, and decided to limit their losses, abandoning efforts to control Iranian airspace. The Iranian air force would henceforth fight on the defensive, trying to deter the Iraqis rather than engaging them. While throughout 1981‚Äì1982 the Iraqi air force would remain weak, within the next few years they would rearm and expand again, and begin to regain the strategic initiative.

====Introduction of human wave attacks====

The Iranians suffered from a shortage of heavy weapons, but had a large number of devoted volunteer troops, so they began using human wave attacks against the Iraqis. Typically, an Iranian assault would commence with poorly trained Basij who would launch the primary human wave assaults to swamp the weakest portions of the Iraqi lines en masse (on some occasions even bodily clearing minefields). This would be followed up by the more experienced Revolutionary Guard infantry, who would breach the weakened Iraqi lines, and followed up by the regular army using mechanized forces, who would maneuver through the breach and attempt to encircle and defeat the enemy.

According to historian Stephen C. Pelletiere, the idea of Iranian &quot;human wave attacks&quot; was a misconception. Instead, the Iranian tactics consisted of using groups of 22-man infantry squads, which moved forward to attack specific objectives. As the squads surged forward to execute their missions, that gave the impression of a &quot;human wave attack&quot;. Nevertheless, the idea of &quot;human wave attacks&quot; remained virtually synonymous with any large-scale infantry frontal assault Iran carried out. Large numbers of troops would be used, aimed at overwhelming the Iraqi lines (usually the weakest portion, typically manned by the Iraqi Popular Army), regardless of losses.

According to the former Iraqi general Ra&#x27;ad al-Hamdani, the Iranian human wave charges consisted of armed &quot;civilians&quot; who carried most of their necessary equipment themselves into battle and often lacked command and control and logistics. Operations were often carried out during the night and deception operations, infiltrations, and maneuvers became more common. The Iranians would also reinforce the infiltrating forces with new units to keep up their momentum. Once a weak point was found, the Iranians would concentrate all of their forces into that area in an attempt to break through with human wave attacks.

The human wave attacks, while extremely bloody (tens of thousands of troops died in the process), when used in combination with infiltration and surprise, caused major Iraqi defeats. As the Iraqis would dig in their tanks and infantry into static, entrenched positions, the Iranians would manage to break through the lines and encircle entire divisions. Merely the fact that the Iranian forces used maneuver warfare by their light infantry against static Iraqi defenses was often the decisive factor in battle. However, lack of coordination between the Iranian Army and IRGC and shortages of heavy weaponry played a detrimental role, often with most of the infantry not being supported by artillery and armor.

====Operation Eighth-Imam====

After the Iraqi offensive stalled in March 1981, there was little change in the front other than Iran retaking the high ground above Susangerd in May. By late 1981, Iran returned to the offensive and launched Operation Samen-ol-A&#x27;emeh¬†(The Eighth Imam), ending the Iraqi Siege of Abadan on 27‚Äì29 September 1981. The Iranians used a combined force of regular army artillery with small groups of armor, supported by Pasdaran (IRGC) and Basij infantry. On 15 October, after breaking the siege, a large Iranian convoy was ambushed by Iraqi tanks, and during the ensuing tank battle Iran lost 20 Chieftains and other armored vehicles and withdrew from the previously gained territory.

====Operation Tariq al-Quds====
On 29 November 1981, Iran began Operation Tariq al-Quds with three army brigades and seven Revolutionary Guard brigades. The Iraqis failed to properly patrol their occupied areas, and the Iranians constructed a road through the unguarded sand dunes, launching their attack from the Iraqi rear. The town of Bostan was retaken from Iraqi divisions by 7 December. By this time the Iraqi Army was experiencing serious morale problems, compounded by the fact that Operation Tariq al-Quds marked the first use of Iranian &quot;human wave&quot; tactics, where the Revolutionary Guard light infantry repeatedly charged at Iraqi positions, oftentimes without the support of armour or air power. The fall of Bostan exacerbated the Iraqis&#x27; logistical problems, forcing them to use a roundabout route from Ahvaz to the south to resupply their troops. 6,000 Iranians and over 2,000 Iraqis were killed in the operation.

===1982: Iraqi retreat, Iranian offensive===

The Iraqis, realising that the Iranians were planning to attack, decided to preempt them with Operation al-Fawz al-&#x27;Azim (Supreme Success) on 19 March. Using a large number of tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets, they attacked the Iranian buildup around the Roghabiyeh pass. Though Saddam and his generals assumed they had succeeded, in reality the Iranian forces remained fully intact. The Iranians had concentrated much of their forces by bringing them directly from the cities and towns throughout Iran via trains, buses, and private cars. The concentration of forces did not resemble a traditional military buildup, and although the Iraqis detected a population buildup near the front, they failed to realize that this was an attacking force. As a result, Saddam&#x27;s army was unprepared for the Iranian offensives to come.

====Operation Fath ol-Mobin====

Iran&#x27;s next major offensive, led by then Colonel Ali Sayad Shirazi, was Operation Fath ol-Mobin. On 22 March 1982, Iran launched an attack which took the Iraqi forces by surprise: using Chinook helicopters, they landed behind Iraqi lines, silenced their artillery, and captured an Iraqi headquarters.

The Revolutionary Guard and regular army followed up by surrounding the Iraqi 9th and 10th Armoured and 1st Mechanised Divisions that had camped close to the Iranian town of Shush. The Iraqis launched a counter-attack using their 12th Armoured division to break the encirclement and rescue the surrounded divisions. Iraqi tanks came under attack by 95 Iranian F-4 Phantom and F-5 Tiger fighter jets, destroying much of the division.

Operation Fath ol-Mobin was an Iranian victory; Iraqi forces were driven away from Shush, Dezful and Ahvaz. The Iranian armed forces destroyed 320‚Äì400 Iraqi tanks and armored vehicles in a costly success. In just the first day of the battle, the Iranians lost 196 tanks. By this time, most of the Khuzestan province had been recaptured.

====Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas====

In preparation for Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas, the Iranians had launched numerous air raids against Iraq air bases, destroying 47 jets (including Iraq&#x27;s brand new Mirage F-1 fighter jets from France); this gave the Iranians air superiority over the battlefield while allowing them to monitor Iraqi troop movements.

On 29 April, Iran launched the offensive. 70,000 Revolutionary Guard and Basij members struck on several axes‚ÄîBostan, Susangerd, the west bank of the Karun River, and Ahvaz. The Basij launched human wave attacks, which were followed up by the regular army and Revolutionary Guard support along with tanks and helicopters. Under heavy Iranian pressure, the Iraqi forces retreated. By 12 May, Iran had driven out all Iraqi forces from the Susangerd area. The Iranians captured several thousand Iraqi troops and a large number of tanks.

The Iraqis retreated to the Karun River, with only Khorramshahr and a few outlying areas remaining in their possession. Saddam ordered 70,000 troops to be placed around the city of Khorramshahr. The Iraqis created a hastily constructed defence line around the city and outlying areas. To discourage airborne commando landings, the Iraqis also placed metal spikes and destroyed cars in areas likely to be used as troop landing zones. Saddam Hussein even visited Khorramshahr in a dramatic gesture, swearing that the city would never be relinquished. However, Khorramshahr&#x27;s only resupply point was across the Shatt al-Arab, and the Iranian air force began bombing the supply bridges to the city, while their artillery zeroed in on the besieged garrison.

=====Second Battle of Khorramshahr=====
In the early morning hours of 23 May 1982, the Iranians began the drive towards Khorramshahr across the Karun River. This part of Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas was spearheaded by the 77th Khorasan division with tanks along with the Revolutionary Guard and Basij. The Iranians hit the Iraqis with destructive air strikes and massive artillery barrages, crossed the Karun River, captured bridgeheads, and launched human wave attacks towards the city. Saddam&#x27;s defensive barricade collapsed; in less than 48 hours of fighting, the city fell and 19,000 Iraqis surrendered to the Iranians. A total of 10,000 Iraqis were killed or wounded in Khorramshahr, while the Iranians suffered 30,000 casualties. During the whole of Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas, 33,000 Iraqi soldiers were captured by the Iranians.

====State of Iraqi armed forces====
The fighting had battered the Iraqi military: its strength fell from 210,000 to 150,000 troops; over 20,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and over 30,000 captured; two out of four active armoured divisions and at least three mechanised divisions fell to less than a brigade&#x27;s strength; and the Iranians had captured over 450 tanks and armoured personnel carriers.

The Iraqi Air Force was also left in poor shape: after losing up to 55 aircraft since early December 1981, they had only 100 intact fighter-bombers and interceptors. A defector who flew his MiG-21 to Syria in June 1982 revealed that the Iraqi Air Force had only three squadrons of fighter-bombers capable of mounting operations into Iran. The Iraqi Army Air Corps was in slightly better shape, and could still operate more than 70 helicopters. Despite this, the Iraqis still held 3,000 tanks, while Iran held 1,000.

At this point, Saddam believed that his army was too demoralised and damaged to hold onto Khuzestan and major swathes of Iranian territory, and withdrew his remaining forces, redeploying them in defence along the border. However, his troops continued to occupy some key Iranian border areas of Iran, including the disputed territories that prompted his invasion, notably the Shatt al-Arab waterway. In response to their failures against the Iranians in Khorramshahr, Saddam ordered the executions of Generals Juwad Shitnah and Salah al-Qadhi and Colonels Masa and al-Jalil. At least a dozen other high-ranking officers were also executed during this time. This became an increasingly common punishment for those who failed him in battle.

===Early international response===

In April 1982, the rival Ba&#x27;athist regime in Syria, one of the few nations that supported Iran, closed the Kirkuk‚ÄìBaniyas pipeline that had allowed Iraqi oil to reach tankers on the Mediterranean, reducing the Iraqi budget by $5¬†billion per month. Journalist Patrick Brogan wrote, &quot;It appeared for a while that Iraq would be strangled economically before it was defeated militarily.&quot; Syria&#x27;s closure of the Kirkuk‚ÄìBaniyas pipeline left Iraq with the pipeline to Turkey as the only means of exporting oil, along with transporting oil by tanker truck to the port of Aqaba in Jordan.

The Turkish pipeline had a capacity of only , which was insufficient to pay for the war. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the other Gulf states saved Iraq from bankruptcy by providing it with $37‚Äì60¬†billion in loans. Though Iraq had previously been hostile towards other Gulf states, &quot;the threat of Persian fundamentalism was far more feared.&quot; They were especially inclined to fear Iranian victory after Ayatollah Khomeini declared monarchies to be illegitimate and an un-Islamic form of government. Khomeini&#x27;s statement was widely received as a call to overthrow the Gulf monarchies. Journalists John Bulloch and Harvey Morris wrote:

The virulent Iranian campaign, which at its peak seemed to be making the overthrow of the Saudi regime a war aim on a par with the defeat of Iraq, did have an effect on the Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia], but not the one the Iranians wanted: instead of becoming more conciliatory, the Saudis became tougher, more self-confident, and less prone to seek compromise.

Saudi Arabia was said to provide Iraq with $1¬†billion per month starting in mid-1982.

Iraq began receiving support from the United States and west European countries as well. Saddam was given diplomatic, monetary, and military support by the United States, including massive loans, political influence, and intelligence on Iranian deployments gathered by American spy satellites. The Iraqis relied heavily on American satellite footage and radar planes to detect Iranian troop movements, and they enabled Iraq to move troops to the site before the battle.

With Iranian success on the battlefield, the United States increased its support of the Iraqi government, supplying intelligence, economic aid, and dual-use equipment and vehicles, as well as normalizing its intergovernmental relations (which had been broken during the 1967 Six-Day War). In March 1982, president Ronald Reagan signed National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM) 4-82‚Äîseeking &quot;a review of U.S. policy toward the Middle East&quot;‚Äîand in June Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) co-written by NSC official Howard Teicher, which determined: &quot;The United States could not afford to allow Iraq to lose the war to Iran&quot;, and that the United States &quot;would do whatever was necessary to prevent Iraq from losing&quot;.

In 1982, Reagan removed Iraq from the list of countries &quot;supporting terrorism&quot; and sold weapons such as howitzers to Iraq via Jordan. France sold Iraq millions of dollars worth of weapons, including Gazelle helicopters, Mirage F-1 fighters, and Exocet missiles. Both the United States and West Germany sold Iraq dual-use pesticides and poisons that would be used to create chemical weapons.

Iran did not have the money to purchase arms to the same extent as Iraq did. They counted on China, North Korea, Libya, Syria, and Japan for supplying anything from weapons and munitions to logistical and engineering equipment.

====Ceasefire proposal====

On 20 June 1982, Saddam announced that he wanted to sue for peace and proposed an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal from Iranian territory within two weeks. Khomeini responded by saying the war would not end until a new government was installed in Iraq and reparations paid. He proclaimed that Iran would invade Iraq and would not stop until the Ba&#x27;ath regime was replaced by an Islamic republic. Iran supported a government in exile for Iraq, the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, led by exiled Iraqi cleric Mohammad Baqer al-Hakim, which was dedicated to overthrowing the Ba&#x27;ath party. They recruited POWs, dissidents, exiles, and Shias to join the Badr Brigade, the military wing of the organisation.

The decision to invade Iraq was taken after much debate within the Iranian government. One faction, comprising Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, President Ali Khamenei, Army Chief of Staff General Ali Sayad Shirazi as well as Major General Qasem-Ali Zahirnejad, wanted to accept the ceasefire, as most of Iranian soil had been recaptured. In particular, General Shirazi and Zahirnejad were both opposed to the invasion of Iraq on logistical grounds, and stated they would consider resigning if &quot;unqualified people continued to meddle with the conduct of the war&quot;. Of the opposing view was a hardline faction led by the clerics on the Supreme Defence Council, whose leader was the politically powerful speaker of the &quot;Majlis&quot;, Akbar Rafsanjani.

Iran also hoped that its attacks would ignite a revolt against Saddam&#x27;s rule by the Shia and Kurdish population of Iraq, possibly resulting in his downfall. It was successful in doing so with the Kurdish population, but not the Shia. Iran had captured large quantities of Iraqi equipment, enough to create several tank battalions, Iran once again had 1,000 tanks, and also managed to clandestinely procure spare parts as well, including those pertaining to the F-14 Tomcat.

At a cabinet meeting in Baghdad, Minister of Health Riyadh Ibrahim Hussein suggested that Saddam could step down temporarily as a way of easing Iran towards a ceasefire, and then afterwards would come back to power. Saddam, annoyed, asked if anyone else in the Cabinet agreed with the Health Minister&#x27;s idea. When no one raised their hand in support, he escorted Riyadh Hussein to the next room, closed the door, and shot him with his pistol.

===Iran invades Iraq and Iraqi tactics in response===

For the most part, Iraq remained on the defensive for the next five years, unable and unwilling to launch any major offensives, while Iran launched more than 70 offensives. Iraq&#x27;s strategy changed from holding territory in Iran to denying Iran any major gains in Iraq, as well as holding onto disputed territories along the border. Saddam began a policy of total war, gearing most of his country towards defending against Iran. By 1988, Iraq was spending 40‚Äì75% of its GDP on military equipment. Saddam had also more than doubled the size of the Iraqi army, from 200,000 soldiers (12 divisions and three independent brigades) to 500,000 (23 divisions and nine brigades). Iraq also began launching air raids against Iranian border cities, greatly increasing the practice by 1984.

By the end of 1982, Iraq had been resupplied with new Soviet and Chinese materiel, and the ground war entered a new phase. Iraq used newly acquired T-55, T-62 and T-72 tanks, as well as Chinese copies, BM-21 truck-mounted rocket launchers, and Mi-24 helicopter gunships to prepare a Soviet-type three-line defence, replete with obstacles such as barbed wire, minefields, fortified positions and bunkers. The Combat Engineer Corps built bridges across water obstacles, laid minefields, erected earthen revetments, dug trenches, built machine gun nests, and prepared new defence lines and fortifications.

Iraq began to focus on using defense in depth to defeat the Iranians. Iraq created multiple static defense lines to bleed the Iranians through sheer size. When faced against large Iranian attack, where human waves would overrun Iraq&#x27;s forward entrenched infantry defences, the Iraqis would often retreat, but their static defences would bleed the Iranians and channel them into certain directions, drawing them into traps or pockets. Iraqi air and artillery attacks would then pin the Iranians down, while tanks and mechanised infantry attacks using mobile warfare would push them back.

Sometimes, the Iraqis would launch &quot;probing attacks&quot; into the Iranian lines to provoke them into launching their attacks sooner. While Iranian human wave attacks were successful against the dug-in Iraqi forces in Khuzestan, they had trouble breaking through Iraq&#x27;s defense in depth lines. Iraq had a logistical advantage in their defence: the front was located near the main Iraqi bases and arms depots, allowing their army to be efficiently supplied. By contrast, the front in Iran was a considerable distance away from the main Iranian bases and arms depots, and as such, Iranian troops and supplies had to travel through mountain ranges before arriving at the front.

Iran&#x27;s military power was weakened once again by large purges in 1982, resulting from another supposedly attempted coup.

====Operation Ramadan (First Battle of Basra)====

The Iranian generals wanted to launch an all-out attack on Baghdad and seize it while the Iranian army&#x27;s supplies allowed for such an offensive. This was rejected as being impracticable and the decision was made to capture one area of Iraq after the other, with the hope that this would force Iraq to withdraw from disputed border territories and begin negotiations to end the war.

On 13 July 1982, Iran began their attack in southern Iraq, near Basra. Called Operation Ramadan, it involved over 180,000 troops from both sides, and was one of the largest land battles since World War II. Iranian strategy dictated that they launch their primary attack on the weakest point of the Iraqi lines. However, the Iraqis were informed of Iran&#x27;s battle plans and moved all of their forces to the area the Iranians planned to attack. The Iraqis were equipped with tear gas to use against the enemy, which was the first major use of chemical warfare during the conflict, throwing an entire attacking division into chaos.

Over 100,000 Revolutionary Guards and Basij volunteer forces charged towards the Iraqi lines. The Iraqi troops had entrenched themselves in formidable defenses, and had set up a network of bunkers and artillery positions. The Basij used human waves, and were even used to bodily clear the Iraqi minefields and allow the Revolutionary Guards to advance. Combatants came so close to one another that Iranians were able to board Iraqi tanks and throw grenades inside the hulls. By the eighth day, the Iranians had gained inside Iraq and had taken several causeways. Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards also used the T-55 tanks they had captured in earlier battles.

The attacks came to a halt and the Iranians turned to defensive measures. Seeing this, Iraq used their Mi-25 helicopters, along with Gazelle helicopters armed with Euromissile HOT, against columns of Iranian mechanised infantry and tanks. These &quot;hunter-killer&quot; teams of helicopters, which had been formed with the help of East German advisors, proved very costly for the Iranians. Aerial dogfights occurred between Iraqi MiGs and Iranian F-4 Phantoms.

On 16 July, Iran tried again further north and managed to push the Iraqis back. Only from Basra, the poorly equipped Iranian forces were surrounded on three sides by Iraqis with heavy weaponry. Some were captured, while many were killed. Only a last-minute attack by Iranian AH-1 Cobra helicopters stopped the Iraqis from routing the Iranians. Three more similar attacks occurred around the Khorramshahr-Baghdad road area towards the end of the month, but none were significantly successful.

Iraq had concentrated three armoured divisions, the 3rd, 9th, and 10th, as a counter-attack force to attack any penetrations. They were successful in defeating the Iranian breakthroughs, but suffered heavy losses. The 9th Armoured Division in particular had to be disbanded, and was never reformed. The total casualty toll had grown to include 80,000 soldiers and civilians. 400 Iranian tanks and armored vehicles were destroyed or abandoned, while Iraq lost at least 370 tanks.

====Final operations of 1982====

After Iran&#x27;s failure in Operation Ramadan, they carried out only a few smaller attacks. Iran launched two limited offensives aimed at reclaiming the Sumar Hills and isolating the Iraqi pocket at Naft shahr at the international border, both of which were part of the disputed territories still under Iraqi occupation. They then aimed to capture the Iraqi border town of Mandali. They planned to take the Iraqis by surprise using Basij militiamen, army helicopters, and some armoured forces, then stretch their defences and possibly break through them to open a road to Baghdad for future exploitation.

During Operation Muslim ibn Aqil (1‚Äì7 October), Iran recovered of disputed territory straddling the international border and reached the outskirts of Mandali before being stopped by Iraqi helicopter and armoured attacks. During Operation Muharram (1‚Äì21 November), the Iranians captured part of the Bayat oilfield with the help of their fighter jets and helicopters, destroying 105 Iraqi tanks, 70 APCs, and 7 planes with few losses. They nearly breached the Iraqi lines but failed to capture Mandali after the Iraqis sent reinforcements, including brand new T-72 tanks, which possessed armour that could not be pierced from the front by Iranian TOW missiles. The Iranian advance was also impeded by heavy rains. 3,500 Iraqis and an unknown number of Iranians died, with only minor gains for Iran.

===1983‚Äì84: Stalemate and war of attrition===

After the failure of the 1982 summer offensives, Iran believed that a major effort along the entire breadth of the front would yield victory. In 1983, the Iranians launched five major assaults along the front. None achieved substantial success, as the Iranians staged more massive &quot;human wave&quot; attacks. By this time, it was estimated that no more than 70 Iranian fighter aircraft were still operational at any given time. Iran had its own helicopter repair facilities, left over from before the revolution, and often used helicopters for close air support.

Iranian fighter pilots had superior training compared to their Iraqi counterparts, as most had received training from US officers before the 1979 revolution, and continued to dominate in combat. However, aircraft shortages, the size of defended territory/airspace, and American intelligence supplied to Iraq allowed the Iraqis to exploit gaps in Iranian airspace. Iraqi air campaigns met little opposition, striking over half of Iran, as the Iraqis were able to gain air superiority towards the end of the war.

====Operation Before the Dawn====
In Operation Before the Dawn, launched 6 February 1983, the Iranians shifted focus from the southern to the central and northern sectors. Employing 200,000 &quot;last reserve&quot; Revolutionary Guard troops, Iran attacked along a stretch near al-Amarah, Iraq, about southeast of Baghdad, in an attempt to reach the highways connecting northern and southern Iraq. The attack was stalled by of hilly escarpments, forests, and river torrents blanketing the way to al-Amarah, but the Iraqis could not force the Iranians back. Iran directed artillery on Basra, Al Amarah, and Mandali.

The Iranians suffered a large number of casualties clearing minefields and breaching Iraqi anti-tank mines, which Iraqi engineers were unable to replace. After this battle, Iran reduced its use of human wave attacks, though they still remained a key tactic as the war went on.

Further Iranian attacks were mounted in the Mandali‚ÄìBaghdad north-central sector in April 1983, but were repelled by Iraqi mechanised and infantry divisions. Casualties were high, and by the end of 1983, an estimated 120,000 Iranians and 60,000 Iraqis had been killed. Iran held the advantage in the war of attrition. In 1983, Iran had an estimated population of 43.6 million to Iraq&#x27;s 14.8 million, and the discrepancy continued to grow throughout the war.

====Dawn Operations====
From early 1983‚Äì1984, Iran launched a series of four &quot;Valfajr&quot; (Dawn) Operations, that eventually numbered to 10. During Operation Dawn-1, in early February 1983, 50,000 Iranian forces attacked westward from Dezful and were confronted by 55,000 Iraqi forces. The Iranian objective was to cut off the road from Basra to Baghdad in the central sector. The Iraqis carried out 150 air sorties against the Iranians, and even bombed Dezful, Ahvaz, and Khorramshahr in retribution. The Iraqi counterattack was broken up by Iran&#x27;s 92nd Armoured Division.

During Operation Dawn-2, the Iranians directed insurgency operations by proxy in April 1983 by supporting the Kurds in the north. With Kurdish support, the Iranians attacked on 23 July 1983, capturing the Iraqi town of Haj Omran and maintaining it against an Iraqi poison gas counteroffensive. This operation incited Iraq to later conduct indiscriminate chemical attacks against the Kurds. The Iranians attempted to further exploit activities in the north on 30 July 1983, during Operation Dawn-3. Iran saw an opportunity to sweep away Iraqi forces controlling the roads between the Iranian mountain border towns of Mehran, Dehloran and Elam. Iraq launched airstrikes, and equipped attack helicopters with chemical warheads. While ineffective, it demonstrated both the Iraqi general staff&#x27;s and Saddam&#x27;s increasing interest in using chemical weapons. In the end, 17,000 had been killed on both sides, with no gain for either country.

The focus of Operation Dawn-4 in September 1983 was the northern sector in Iranian Kurdistan. Three Iranian regular divisions, the Revolutionary Guard, and Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) elements amassed in Marivan and Sardasht in a move to threaten the major Iraqi city Suleimaniyah. Iran&#x27;s strategy was to press Kurdish tribes to occupy the Banjuin Valley, which was within of Suleimaniyah and from the oilfields of Kirkuk. To stem the tide, Iraq deployed Mi-8 attack helicopters equipped with chemical weapons and executed 120 sorties against the Iranian force, which stopped them into Iraqi territory.

5,000 Iranians and 2,500 Iraqis died. Iran gained of its territory back in the north, gained of Iraqi land, and captured 1,800 Iraqi prisoners while Iraq abandoned large quantities of valuable weapons and war materiel in the field. Iraq responded to these losses by firing a series of SCUD-B missiles into the cities of Dezful, Masjid Soleiman, and Behbehan. Iran&#x27;s use of artillery against Basra while the battles in the north raged created multiple fronts, which effectively confused and wore down Iraq.

====Iran&#x27;s change in tactics====
Previously, the Iranians had outnumbered the Iraqis on the battlefield, but Iraq expanded their military draft, pursuing a policy of total war, and by 1984, the armies were equal in size. By 1986, Iraq had twice as many soldiers as Iran. By 1988, Iraq had 1¬†million soldiers, giving it the fourth largest army in the world. Some of its equipment, such as tanks, outnumbered Iran&#x27;s by at least five to one. Iranian commanders, however, remained more tactically skilled.

After the Dawn Operations, Iran attempted to change tactics. In the face of increasing Iraqi defense in depth, as well as increased armaments and manpower, Iran could no longer rely on simple human wave attacks. Iranian offensives became more complex and involved extensive maneuver warfare using primarily light infantry. Iran launched frequent, and sometimes smaller offensives to slowly gain ground and deplete the Iraqis through attrition. They wanted to drive Iraq into economic failure by wasting money on weapons and war mobilization, and to deplete their smaller population by bleeding them dry, in addition to creating an anti-government insurgency. They were successful in Kurdistan, but not southern Iraq.

Iran supported their attacks with heavy weaponry when possible and with better planning, although the brunt of the battles still fell to the infantry. The Army and Revolutionary Guards worked together better as their tactics improved. Human wave attacks became less frequent, although were still used. To negate the Iraqi advantage of defense in depth, static positions, and heavy firepower, Iran began to focus on fighting in areas where the Iraqis could not use their heavy weaponry, such as marshes, valleys, and mountains, and frequently using infiltration tactics.

Iran began training troops in infiltration, patrolling, night-fighting, marsh warfare, and mountain warfare. They began training thousands of Revolutionary Guard commandos in amphibious warfare, as southern Iraq is marshy and filled with wetlands. Iran used speedboats to cross the marshes and rivers in southern Iraq and landed troops on the opposing banks, where they would dig and set up pontoon bridges across the rivers and wetlands to allow heavy troops and supplies to cross. Iran also learned to integrate foreign guerrilla units as part of their military operations. On the northern front, Iran began working heavily with the Peshmerga, Kurdish guerrillas. Iranian military advisors organised the Kurds into raiding parties of 12 guerrillas, which would attack Iraqi command posts, troop formations, infrastructure, including roads and supply lines, and government buildings. The oil refineries of Kirkuk became a favourite target, and were often hit by homemade Peshmerga rockets.

====Battle of the Marshes====


By 1984, the Iranian ground forces were reorganised well enough for the Revolutionary Guard to start Operation Kheibar, which lasted from 24 February to 19 March. On 15 February 1984, the Iranians began launching attacks against the central section of the front, where the Second Iraqi Army Corps was deployed: 250,000 Iraqis faced 250,000 Iranians. The goal of this new major offensive was the capture of Basra-Baghdad Highway, cutting off Basra from Baghdad and setting the stage for an eventual attack upon the city. The Iraqi high command had assumed that the marshlands above Basra were natural barriers to attack, and had not reinforced them. The marshes negated Iraqi advantage in armor, and absorbed artillery rounds and bombs. Prior to the attack, Iranian commandos on helicopters had landed behind Iraqi lines and destroyed Iraqi artillery. Iran launched two preliminary attacks prior to the main offensive, Operation Dawn 5 and Dawn 6.

Operation Kheibar began on 24 February with Iranian infantrymen crossing the Hawizeh Marshes using motorboats and transport helicopters in an amphibious assault. The Iranians attacked the vital oil-producing Majnoon Island by landing troops via helicopters onto the islands and severing the communication lines between Amareh and Basra. They then continued the attack towards Qurna. By 27 February, they had captured the island, but suffered catastrophic helicopter losses to the IrAF. On that day, a massive array of Iranian helicopters transporting Pasdaran troops were intercepted by Iraqi combat aircraft (MiGs, Mirages and Sukhois). In what was essentially an aerial slaughter, Iraqi jets shot down 49 of the 50 Iranian helicopters. At times, fighting took place in waters over deep. Iraq ran live electrical cables through the water, electrocuting numerous Iranian troops and then displaying their corpses on state television.

By 29 February, the Iranians had reached the outskirts of Qurna and were closing in on the Baghdad‚ÄìBasra highway. They had broken out of the marshes and returned to open terrain, where they were confronted by Iraqi artillery, tanks, air power, and mustard gas. 1,200 Iranian soldiers were killed in the counter-attack. The Iranians retreated back to the marshes, though they still held onto them along with Majnoon Island.
The Battle of the Marshes saw an Iraqi defence that had been under continuous strain since 15 February. They were relieved by their use of chemical weapons and defence-in-depth, where they layered defensive lines: even if the Iranians broke through the first line, they were usually unable to break through the second due to exhaustion and heavy losses. They largely relied on Mi-24 Hind to &quot;hunt&quot; the Iranian troops in the marshes. At least 20,000 Iranians were killed in the marsh battles. Iran used the marshes as a springboard for future attacks/infiltrations.

Four years into the war, the human cost to Iran had been 170,000 combat fatalities and 340,000 wounded. Iraqi combat fatalities were estimated at 80,000 with 150,000 wounded.

===&quot;Tanker war&quot; and the &quot;war of the cities&quot;===

Unable to launch successful ground attacks against Iran, Iraq used their now expanded air force to carry out strategic bombing against Iranian shipping, economic targets, and cities in order to damage Iran&#x27;s economy and morale. Iraq also wanted to provoke Iran into doing something that would cause the superpowers to be directly involved in the conflict on the Iraqi side.

====Attacks on shipping====

The so-called &quot;tanker war&quot; started when Iraq attacked the oil terminal and oil tankers at Kharg Island in early 1984. Iraq&#x27;s aim in attacking Iranian shipping was to provoke the Iranians to retaliate with extreme measures, such as closing the Strait of Hormuz to all maritime traffic, thereby bringing American intervention; the United States had threatened several times to intervene if the Strait of Hormuz were closed. As a result, the Iranians limited their retaliatory attacks to Iraqi shipping, leaving the strait open to general passage.

Iraq declared that all ships going to or from Iranian ports in the northern zone of the Persian Gulf were subject to attack. They used F-1 Mirage, Super Etendard, Mig-23, Su-20/22, and Super Frelon helicopters armed with Exocet anti-ship missiles as well as Soviet-made air-to-surface missiles to enforce their threats. Iraq repeatedly bombed Iran&#x27;s main oil export facility on Kharg Island, causing increasingly heavy damage. As a first response to these attacks, Iran attacked a Kuwaiti tanker carrying Iraqi oil near Bahrain on 13 May 1984, as well as a Saudi tanker in Saudi waters on 16 May.

Because Iraq had become landlocked during the course of the war, they had to rely on their Arab allies, primarily Kuwait, to transport their oil. Iran attacked tankers carrying Iraqi oil from Kuwait, later attacking tankers from any Persian Gulf state supporting Iraq. Attacks on ships of noncombatant nations in the Persian Gulf sharply increased thereafter, with both nations attacking oil tankers and merchant ships of neutral nations in an effort to deprive their opponent of trade. The Iranian attacks against Saudi shipping led to Saudi F-15s shooting down a pair of F-4 Phantom II fighters on 5 June 1984.

The air and small-boat attacks did little damage to Persian Gulf state economies, and Iran moved its shipping port to Larak Island in the Strait of Hormuz.

The Iranian Navy imposed a naval blockade of Iraq, using its British-built frigates to stop and inspect any ships thought to be trading with Iraq. They operated with virtual impunity, as Iraqi pilots had little training in hitting naval targets. Some Iranian warships attacked tankers with ship-to-ship missiles, while others used their radars to guide land-based anti-ship missiles to their targets. Iran began to rely on its new Revolutionary Guard&#x27;s navy, which used Boghammar speedboats fitted with rocket launchers and heavy machine guns. These speedboats would launch surprise attacks against tankers and cause substantial damage. Iran also used F-4 Phantom II fighters and helicopters to launch Maverick missiles and unguided rockets at tankers.

A U.S. Navy ship, , was struck on 17 May 1987 by two Exocet anti-ship missiles fired from an Iraqi F-1 Mirage plane. The missiles had been fired at about the time the plane was given a routine radio warning by &quot;Stark&quot;. The frigate did not detect the missiles with radar, and warning was given by the lookout only moments before they struck. Both missiles hit the ship, and one exploded in crew quarters, killing 37 sailors and wounding 21.

Lloyd&#x27;s of London, a British insurance market, estimated that the tanker war damaged 546 commercial vessels and killed about 430 civilian sailors. The largest portion of the attacks was directed by Iraq against vessels in Iranian waters, with the Iraqis launching three times as many attacks as the Iranians. But Iranian speedboat attacks on Kuwaiti shipping led Kuwait to formally petition foreign powers on 1 November 1986 to protect its shipping. The Soviet Union agreed to charter tankers starting in 1987, and the United States Navy offered to provide protection for foreign tankers reflagged and flying the U.S. flag starting 7 March 1987 in Operation Earnest Will. Neutral tankers shipping to Iran were not protected by Earnest Will, resulting in reduced foreign tanker traffic to Iran, since they risked Iraqi air attack. Iran accused the United States of helping Iraq.

During the course of the war, Iran attacked two Soviet merchant ships.

&quot;Seawise Giant&quot;, the largest ship ever built, was struck by Iraqi Exocet missiles as it was carrying Iranian crude oil out of the Persian Gulf.

====Attacks on cities====
Meanwhile, Iraq&#x27;s air force also began carrying out strategic bombing raids against Iranian cities. While Iraq had launched numerous attacks with aircraft and missiles against border cities from the beginning of the war and sporadic raids on Iran&#x27;s main cities, this was the first systematic strategic bombing that Iraq carried out during the war. This would become known as the &quot;war of the cities&quot;. With the help of the USSR and the west, Iraq&#x27;s air force had been rebuilt and expanded. Meanwhile, Iran, due to sanctions and lack of spare parts, had heavily curtailed its air force operations. Iraq used Tu-22 Blinder and Tu-16 Badger strategic bombers to carry out long-range high-speed raids on Iranian cities, including Tehran. Fighter-bombers such as the MiG-25 Foxbat and Su-22 Fitter were used against smaller or shorter range targets, as well as escorting the strategic bombers. Civilian and industrial targets were hit by the raids, and each successful raid inflicted economic damage from regular strategic bombing.

In response, the Iranians deployed their F-4 Phantoms to combat the Iraqis, and eventually they deployed F-14s as well. By 1986, Iran also expanded their air defense network heavily to relieve the pressure on the air force. By later in the war, Iraqi air attacks were used only on fewer, more important targets. Starting in 1987, Saddam also ordered several chemical attacks on civilian targets in Iran, such as the town of Sardasht.

Iran also launched several retaliatory air raids on Iraq, while primarily shelling border cities such as Basra. Iran also bought some Scud missiles from Libya, and launched them against Baghdad. These too inflicted damage upon Iraq.

On 7 February 1984, during the first war of the cities, Saddam ordered his air force to attack eleven Iranian cities; bombardments ceased on 22 February 1984. It was estimated that 1,200 Iranian civilians were killed during the raids in February alone.

====Strategic situation in 1984====
By 1984, Iran&#x27;s losses were estimated to be 300,000 soldiers, while Iraq&#x27;s losses were estimated to be 150,000. Foreign analysts agreed that both Iran and Iraq failed to use their modern equipment properly, and both sides failed to carry out modern military assaults that could win the war. Both sides also abandoned equipment in the battlefield because their technicians were unable to carry out repairs. Iran and Iraq showed little internal coordination on the battlefield, and in many cases units were left to fight on their own. As a result, by the end of 1984, the war was a stalemate. One limited offensive Iran launched (Dawn 7) took place from 18 to 25 October 1984, when they recaptured the Iranian city of Mehran, which had been occupied by the Iraqis from the beginning of the war.

===1985‚Äì86 Iraqi offensives===
By 1985, Iraqi armed forces were receiving financial support from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Persian Gulf states, and were making substantial arms purchases from the Soviet Union, China, and France. For the first time since early 1980, Saddam launched new offensives.

On 6 January 1986, the Iraqis launched an offensive attempting to retake Majnoon Island. They were quickly bogged down into a stalemate against 200,000 Iranian infantrymen, reinforced by amphibious divisions. However, they managed to gain a foothold in the southern part of the island.

Iraq also carried out another &quot;war of the cities&quot; between 12 and 14 March, hitting up to 158 targets in over 30 towns and cities, including Tehran. Iran responded by launching 14 Scud missiles for the first time, purchased from Libya. More Iraqi air attacks were carried out in August, resulting in hundreds of additional civilian casualties. Iraqi attacks against both Iranian and neutral oil tankers in Iranian waters continued, with Iraq carrying out 150 airstrikes using French bought Super Etendard and Mirage F-1 jets as well as Super Frelon helicopters, armed with Exocet missiles.

====Operation Badr====

The Iraqis attacked again on 28 January 1985; they were defeated, and the Iranians retaliated on 11 March 1985 with a major offensive directed against the Baghdad-Basra highway (one of the few major offensives conducted in 1985), codenamed Operation Badr (after the Battle of Badr, Muhammad&#x27;s first military victory in Mecca). Ayatollah Khomeini urged Iranians on, declaring:

It is our belief that Saddam wishes to return Islam to blasphemy and polytheism...if America becomes victorious...and grants victory to Saddam, Islam will receive such a blow that it will not be able to raise its head for a long time...The issue is one of Islam versus blasphemy, and not of Iran versus Iraq.

This operation was similar to Operation Kheibar, though it invoked more planning. Iran used 100,000 troops, with 60,000 more in reserve. They assessed the marshy terrain, plotted points where they could land tanks, and constructed pontoon bridges across the marshes. The Basij forces were also equipped with anti-tank weapons.

The ferocity of the Iranian offensive broke through the Iraqi lines. The Revolutionary Guard, with the support of tanks and artillery, broke through north of Qurna on 14 March. That same night 3,000 Iranian troops reached and crossed the Tigris River using pontoon bridges and captured part of the Baghdad‚ÄìBasra Highway 6, which they had failed to achieve in Operations Dawn 5 and 6.

Saddam responded by launching chemical attacks against the Iranian positions along the highway and by initiating the aforementioned second &quot;war of the cities&quot;, with an air and missile campaign against twenty to thirty Iranian population centres, including Tehran. Under General Sultan Hashim Ahmad al-Tai and General Jamal Zanoun (both considered to be among Iraq&#x27;s most skilled commanders), the Iraqis launched air attacks against the Iranian positions and pinned them down. They then launched a pincer attack using mechanized infantry and heavy artillery. Chemical weapons were used, and the Iraqis also flooded Iranian trenches with specially constructed pipes delivering water from the Tigris River.

The Iranians retreated back to the Hoveyzeh marshes while being attacked by helicopters, and the highway was recaptured by the Iraqis. Operation Badr resulted in 10,000‚Äì12,000 Iraqi casualties and 15,000 Iranian ones.

===Iranian counteroffensives===

The failure of the human wave attacks in earlier years had prompted Iran to develop a better working relationship between the Army and the Revolutionary Guard and to mould the Revolutionary Guard units into a more conventional fighting force. To combat Iraq&#x27;s use of chemical weapons, Iran began producing an antidote. They also created and fielded their own homemade drones, the Mohajer 1&#x27;s, fitted with six RPG-7&#x27;s to launch attacks. They were primarily used in observation, being used for up to 700 sorties.

For the rest of 1986, and until the spring of 1988, the Iranian Air Force&#x27;s efficiency in air defence increased, with weapons being repaired or replaced and new tactical methods being used. For example, the Iranians would loosely integrate their SAM Sites and interceptors to create &quot;killing fields&quot; in which dozens of Iraqi planes were lost, which was reported in the West as the Iranian Air Force using F-14s as &quot;mini-AWACs&quot;. The Iraqi Air Force reacted by increasing the sophistication of its equipment, incorporating modern electronic countermeasure pods, decoys such as chaff and flare, and anti-radiation missiles.

Due to the heavy losses in the last war of the cities, Iraq reduced their use of aerial attacks on Iranian cities. Instead, they launched Scud missiles, which the Iranians could not stop. Since the range of the Scud missile was too short to reach Tehran, they converted them to al-Husayn missiles with the help of East German engineers, cutting up their Scuds into three chunks and attaching them together. Iran responded to these attacks by using their own Scud missiles.

Compounding the extensive foreign help to Iraq, Iranian attacks were severely hampered by their shortages of weaponry, particularly heavy weapons as large amounts had been lost during the war. Iran still managed to maintain 1,000 tanks, often by capturing Iraqi ones and additional artillery, but many needed repairs to be operational. By this time Iran managed to procure spare parts from various sources, helping them to restore some weapons. They secretly imported some weapons, such as RBS-70 anti-aircraft MANPADS. In an exception to the United States&#x27; support for Iraq, in exchange for Iran using its influence to help free western hostages in Lebanon, the United States secretly sold Iran some limited supplies. In Akbar Rafsanjani&#x27;s postwar interview, he stated that during the period when Iran was succeeding, for a short time the United States supported Iran, then shortly after began helping Iraq again. Iran managed to get some advanced weapons, such as anti-tank TOW missiles, which worked better than rocket-propelled grenades. Iran later reverse-engineered and produced those weapons themselves. All of these almost certainly helped increase the effectiveness of Iran, although it did not reduce the human cost of their attacks.

====First Battle of al-Faw====


On the night of 10‚Äì11 February 1986, the Iranians launched Operation Dawn 8, in which 30,000 troops in five Army divisions and men from the Revolutionary Guard and Basij advanced in a two-pronged offensive to capture the al-Faw peninsula in southern Iraq, the only area touching the Persian Gulf. The capture of Al Faw and Umm Qasr was a major goal for Iran. Iran began with a feint attack against Basra, which was stopped by the Iraqis.

Meanwhile, an amphibious strike force landed at the foot of the peninsula. The resistance, consisting of several thousand poorly trained soldiers of the Iraqi Popular Army, fled or were defeated, and the Iranian forces set up pontoon bridges crossing the Shatt al-Arab, allowing 30,000 soldiers to cross in a short period of time. They drove north along the peninsula almost unopposed, capturing it after only 24 hours of fighting. Afterwards they dug in and set up defenses.

The sudden capture of al-Faw shocked the Iraqis, since they had thought it impossible for the Iranians to cross the Shatt al-Arab. On 12 February 1986, the Iraqis began a counter-offensive to retake al-Faw, which failed after a week of heavy fighting. On 24 February 1986, Saddam sent one of his best commanders, General Maher Abd al-Rashid, and the Republican Guard to begin a new offensive to recapture al-Faw. A new round of heavy fighting took place. Their attempts again ended in failure, costing them many tanks and aircraft. Their 15th mechanised division was almost completely wiped out. The capture of al-Faw and the failure of the Iraqi counter-offensives were blows to the Ba&#x27;ath regime&#x27;s prestige, and led the Gulf countries to fear that Iran might win the war. Kuwait in particular felt menaced with Iranian troops only away, and increased its support of Iraq accordingly.

In March 1986, the Iranians tried to follow up their success by attempting to take Umm Qasr, which would have completely severed Iraq from the Gulf and placed Iranian troops on the border with Kuwait. The offensive failed due to Iranian shortages of armor. By this time, 17,000 Iraqis and 30,000 Iranians were casualties. The First Battle of al-Faw ended in March, but heavy combat operations lasted on the peninsula into 1988, with neither side being able to displace the other. The battle bogged down into a World War I-style stalemate in the marshes of the peninsula.

====Battle of Mehran====

Immediately after the Iranian capture of al-Faw, Saddam declared a new offensive against Iran, designed to drive deep into the state. The Iranian border city of Mehran, on the foot of the Zagros Mountains, was selected as the first target. On 15‚Äì19 May, Iraqi Army&#x27;s Second Corps, supported by helicopter gunships, attacked and captured the city. Saddam then offered to exchange Mehran for al-Faw. The Iranians rejected the offer. Iraq then continued the attack, attempting to push deeper into Iran. Iraq&#x27;s attack was quickly warded off by Iranian AH-1 Cobra helicopters with TOW missiles, which destroyed numerous Iraqi tanks and vehicles.

The Iranians built up their forces on the heights surrounding Mehran. On 30 June, using mountain warfare tactics, they launched their attack, recapturing the city by 3 July. Saddam ordered the Republican Guard to retake the city on 4 July, but their attack was ineffective. Iraqi losses were heavy enough to allow the Iranians to also capture territory inside Iraq, and depleted the Iraqi military enough to prevent them from launching a major offensive for the next two years. Iraq&#x27;s defeats at al-Faw and at Mehran were severe blows to the prestige of the Iraqi regime. Western powers, including the US, became more determined to prevent an Iraqi loss.

====Situation at the end of 1986====

Through the eyes of international observers, Iran was prevailing in the war by the end of 1986. In the northern front, the Iranians began launching attacks toward the city of Suleimaniya with the help of Kurdish fighters, taking the Iraqis by surprise. They came within of the city before being stopped by chemical and army attacks. Iran&#x27;s army had also reached the Meimak Hills, only from Baghdad. Iraq managed to contain Iran&#x27;s offensives in the south, but was under serious pressure, as the Iranians were slowly overwhelming them.

Iraq retaliated by initiating another &quot;war of the cities&quot;. In one attack, Tehran&#x27;s main oil refinery was hit, and in another instance, Iraq damaged Iran&#x27;s Assadabad satellite dish, disrupting Iranian overseas telephone and telex service for almost two weeks. Civilian areas were also hit, resulting in many casualties. Iraq continued to attack oil tankers via air. Iran responded by launching Scud missiles and air attacks at Iraqi targets.

Iraq continued to attack Kharg Island and the oil tankers and facilities as well. Iran created a tanker shuttle service of 20 tankers to move oil from Kharg to Larak Island, escorted by Iranian fighter jets. Once moved to Larak, the oil would be moved to oceangoing tankers, usually neutral. They also rebuilt the oil terminals damaged by Iraqi air raids and moved shipping to Larak Island, while attacking foreign tankers that carried Iraqi oil, as Iran had blocked Iraq&#x27;s access to the open sea with the capture of al-Faw. By now, they almost always used the armed speedboats of the IRGC navy, and attacked many tankers.

The tanker war escalated drastically, with attacks nearly doubling in 1986, the majority carried out by Iraq. Iraq got permission from the Saudi government to use its airspace to attack Larak Island, although due to the distance attacks were less frequent there. The escalating tanker war in the Gulf became an ever-increasing concern to foreign powers, especially the United States.

In April 1986, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa declaring that the war must be won by March 1987. The Iranians increased recruitment efforts, obtaining 650,000 volunteers. The animosity between the Army and the Revolutionary Guard arose again, with the Army wanting to use more refined, limited military attacks, while the Revolutionary Guard wanted to carry out major offensives. Iran, confident in its successes, began planning their largest offensives of the war, which they called their &quot;final offensives&quot;.

====Iraq&#x27;s dynamic defense strategy====

Faced with their recent defeats in al-Faw and Mehran, Iraq appeared to be losing the war. Iraq&#x27;s generals, angered by Saddam&#x27;s interference, threatened a full-scale mutiny against the Ba&#x27;ath Party unless they were allowed to conduct operations freely. In one of the few times during his career, Saddam gave in to the demands of his generals. Up to this point, Iraqi strategy was to ride out Iranian attacks. However, the defeat at al-Faw led Saddam to declare the war to be &quot;Al-Defa al-Mutaharakha&quot; (The Dynamic Defense), and announcing that all civilians had to take part in the war effort.

The government tried to integrate the Shias into the war effort by recruiting many as part of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. In an attempt to counterbalance the religious fervor of the Iranians and gain support from the devout masses, the regime also began to promote religion and, on the surface, Islamization, despite the fact that Iraq was run by a secular regime. Scenes of Saddam praying and making pilgrimages to shrines became common on state-run television. While Iraqi morale had been low throughout the war, the attack on al-Faw raised patriotic fervor, as the Iraqis feared invasion.

Saddam also recruited volunteers from other Arab countries into the Republican Guard, and received much technical support from foreign nations as well. While Iraqi military power had been depleted in recent battles, through heavy foreign purchases and support, they were able to expand their military to much larger proportions by 1988.

At the same time, Saddam ordered the al-Anfal campaign in an attempt to crush the Kurdish resistance, who were now allied with Iran. The result was the deaths of several hundred thousand Iraqi Kurds, and the destruction of villages, towns, and cities.

Iraq began to try to perfect its maneuver tactics. The Iraqis began to prioritize the professionalization of their military. Prior to 1986, the conscription-based Iraqi regular army and the volunteer-based Iraqi Popular Army conducted the bulk of the operations in the war, to little effect. The Republican Guard, formerly an elite praetorian guard, was expanded as a volunteer army and filled with Iraq&#x27;s best generals. Loyalty to the state was no longer a primary requisite for joining. After the war, due to Saddam&#x27;s paranoia, the former duties of the Republican Guard were transferred to a new unit, the Special Republican Guard. Full-scale war games against hypothetical Iranian positions were carried out in the western Iraqi desert against mock targets. They were repeated over the course of a full year until the forces involved fully memorized their attacks. Iraq built its military massively, eventually possessing the 4th largest in the world, in order to overwhelm the Iranians through sheer size.

===1987‚Äì88: Renewed Iranian Offensives===

Meanwhile, Iran continued to attack as the Iraqis were planning their strike. In 1987 the Iranians renewed a series of major human wave offensives in both northern and southern Iraq. The Iraqis had elaborately fortified Basra with 5 defensive rings, exploiting natural waterways such as the Shatt-al-Arab and artificial ones, such as &quot;Fish Lake&quot; and the Jasim River, along with earth barriers. Fish Lake was a massive lake filled with mines, underwater barbed wire, electrodes and sensors. Behind each waterway and defensive line was radar-guided artillery, ground attack aircraft and helicopters, all capable of firing poison gas or conventional munitions.

The Iranian strategy was to penetrate the Iraqi defences and encircle Basra, cutting off the city as well as the Al-Faw peninsula from the rest of Iraq. Iran&#x27;s plan was for three assaults: a diversionary attack near Basra, the main offensive and another diversionary attack using Iranian tanks in the north to divert Iraqi heavy armor from Basra. For these battles, Iran had re-expanded their military by recruiting many new Basij and Pasdaran volunteers. Iran brought 150,000‚Äì200,000 total troops into the battles.

==== Operation Karbala-4 ====
On 25 December 1986, Iran launched Operation Karbala-4 (&quot;Karbala&quot; referring to Husayn ibn Ali&#x27;s Battle of Karbala). According to Iraqi General Ra&#x27;ad al-Hamdani, this was a diversionary attack. The Iranians launched an amphibious assault against the Iraqi island of Umm al-Rassas in the Shatt-Al-Arab river, parallel to Khoramshahr. They then set up a pontoon bridge and continued the attack, eventually capturing the island in a costly success but failing to advance further. The Iranians had 60,000 casualties, while the Iraqis 9,500. The Iraqi commanders exaggerated Iranian losses to Saddam, and it was assumed that the main Iranian attack on Basra had been fully defeated and that it would take the Iranians six months to recover. When the main Iranian attack, Operation Karbala 5, began, many Iraqi troops were on leave.

====Karbala-5 (Sixth Battle of Basra)====
The Siege of Basra, code-named Operation Karbala-5 (), was an offensive operation carried out by Iran in an effort to capture the Iraqi port city of Basra in early 1987. This battle, known for its extensive casualties and ferocious conditions, was the biggest battle of the war and proved to be the beginning of the end of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. While Iranian forces crossed the border and captured the eastern section of Basra Governorate, the operation ended in a stalemate.

====Karbala-6====
At the same time as Operation Karbala 5, Iran launched Operation Karbala-6 against the Iraqis in Qasr-e Shirin in central Iran to prevent the Iraqis from rapidly transferring units down to defend against the Karbala-5 attack. The attack was carried out by Basij infantry and the Revolutionary Guard&#x27;s 31st &quot;Ashura&quot; and the Army&#x27;s 77th &quot;Khorasan&quot; armored divisions. The Basij attacked the Iraqi lines, forcing the Iraqi infantry to retreat. An Iraqi armored counter-attack surrounded the Basij in a pincer movement. The Iranian tank divisions attacked, breaking the encirclement. The Iranian attack was stopped by mass Iraqi chemical weapons attacks.

===Iranian war-weariness===

Operation Karbala-5 was a severe blow to Iran&#x27;s military and morale. To foreign observers, it appeared that Iran was continuing to strengthen. By 1988, Iran had become self-sufficient in many areas, such as anti-tank TOW missiles, Scud ballistic missiles (Shahab-1), Silkworm anti-ship missiles, Oghab tactical rockets, and producing spare parts for their weaponry. Iran had improved its air defenses with smuggled surface to air missiles. Iran was even producing UAV&#x27;s and the Pilatus PC-7 propeller aircraft for observation. Iran doubled their stocks of artillery, and was self-sufficient in the manufacture of ammunition and small arms.

While it was not obvious to foreign observers, the Iranian public had become increasingly war-weary and disillusioned with the fighting, and relatively few volunteers joined the fight in 1987‚Äì88. Because the Iranian war effort relied on popular mobilization, their military strength actually declined, and Iran was unable to launch any major offensives after Karbala-5. As a result, for the first time since 1982, the momentum of the fighting shifted towards the regular army. Since the regular army was conscription based, it made the war even less popular. Many Iranians began to try to escape the conflict. As early as May 1985, anti-war demonstrations took place in 74 cities throughout Iran, which were crushed by the regime, resulting in some protesters being shot and killed.

The leadership acknowledged that the war was a stalemate, and began to plan accordingly. No more &quot;final offensives&quot; were planned. The head of the Supreme Defense Council Akbar Rafsanjani announced during a news conference the end of human wave attacks. Mohsen Rezaee, head of the IRGC, announced that Iran would focus exclusively on limited attacks and infiltrations, while arming and supporting opposition groups inside of Iraq.

On the Iranian home front, sanctions, declining oil prices, and Iraqi attacks on Iranian oil facilities and shipping took a heavy toll on the economy. While the attacks themselves were not as destructive as some analysts believed, the U.S.-led Operation Earnest Will, which protected Iraqi and allied oil tankers, but not Iranian ones, led many neutral countries to stop trading with Iran because of rising insurance and fear of air attack. Iranian oil and non-oil exports fell by 55%, inflation reached 50% by 1987, and unemployment skyrocketed. At the same time, Iraq was experiencing crushing debt and shortages of workers, encouraging its leadership to try to end the war quickly.

====Strategic situation in late 1987====


By the end of 1987, Iraq possessed 5,550 tanks, outnumbering the Iranians six to one, and 900 fighter aircraft, outnumbering the Iranians ten to one. After Operation Karbala-5, Iraq only had 100 qualified fighter pilots remaining. Therefore, Iraq began to invest in recruiting foreign pilots from countries such as Belgium, South Africa, Pakistan, East Germany and the Soviet Union. They replenished their manpower by integrating volunteers from other Arab countries into their army. Iraq also became self-sufficient in chemical weapons and some conventional ones and received much equipment from abroad. Foreign support helped Iraq bypass its economic troubles and massive debt to continue the war and increase the size of its military.

While the southern and central fronts were at a stalemate, Iran began to focus on carrying out offensives in northern Iraq with the help of the Peshmerga (Kurdish insurgents). The Iranians used a combination of semi-guerrilla and infiltration tactics in the Kurdish mountains with the Peshmerga. During Operation Karbala-9 in early April, Iran captured territory near Suleimaniya, provoking a severe poison gas counter-attack. During Operation Karbala-10, Iran attacked near the same area, capturing more territory. During Operation Nasr-4, the Iranians surrounded the city of Suleimaniya and, with the help of the Peshmerga, infiltrated over 140¬†km into Iraq and raided and threatened to capture the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and other northern oilfields.

=== Air and tanker war ===

With the stalemate on land, the air/tanker war began to play an increasingly major role in the conflict. The Iranian air force had become very small, with only 20 F-4 Phantoms, 20 F-5 Tigers, and 15 F-14 Tomcats in operation, although Iran managed to restore some damaged planes to service. The Iranian Air Force, despite its once sophisticated equipment, lacked enough equipment and personnel to sustain the war of attrition that had developed, and was unable to lead an outright onslaught against Iraq.

The Iraqi Air Force, had originally lacked modern equipment and experienced pilots, but after pleas from Iraqi military leaders, Saddam decreased political influence on everyday operations and left the fighting to his combatants. The Soviets began delivering more advanced aircraft and weapons to Iraq, while the French improved training for flight crews and technical personnel and continually introduced new methods for countering Iranian weapons and tactics. Iranian ground air defense still shot down many Iraqi aircraft.

The main Iraqi air effort had shifted to the destruction of Iranian war-fighting capability, primarily Persian Gulf oil fields, tankers, and Kharg Island, and starting in late 1986, the Iraqi Air Force began a comprehensive campaign against Iranian economic infrastructure. By late 1987, the Iraqi Air Force could count on direct American support for conducting long-range operations against Iranian infrastructural targets and oil installations deep in the Persian Gulf. U.S. Navy ships tracked and reported movements of Iranian shipping and defences. In the massive Iraqi air strike against Kharg Island, flown on 18 March 1988, the Iraqis destroyed two supertankers but lost five aircraft to Iranian F-14 Tomcats, including two Tupolev Tu-22Bs and one Mikoyan MiG-25RB.

The attacks on oil tankers continued. Both Iran and Iraq carried out frequent attacks during the first four months of the year. Iran was effectively waging a naval guerilla war with its IRGC navy speedboats, while Iraq attacked with its aircraft. In 1987, Kuwait asked to reflag its tankers to the U.S. flag. They did so in March, and the U.S. Navy began Operation Earnest Will to escort the tankers. The result of Earnest Will would be that, while oil tankers shipping Iraqi/Kuwaiti oil were protected, Iranian tankers and neutral tankers shipping to Iran would be unprotected, resulting in both losses for Iran and the undermining of its trade with foreign countries, damaging Iran&#x27;s economy further.

Iran deployed Silkworm missiles to attack ships, but only a few were actually fired. Both the United States and Iran jockeyed for influence in the Gulf. To discourage the United States from escorting tankers, Iran secretly mined some areas. The United States began to escort the reflagged tankers, but one was damaged by a mine while under escort. While being a public-relations victory for Iran, the United States increased its reflagging efforts. While Iran mined the Persian Gulf, their speedboat attacks were reduced, primarily attacking unflagged tankers shipping in the area.

On 24 September, US Navy SEALS captured the Iranian mine-laying ship &quot;Iran Ajr&quot;, a diplomatic disaster for the already isolated Iranians. Iran had previously sought to maintain at least a pretense of plausible deniability regarding its use of mines, but the Navy SEALS captured and photographed extensive evidence of &quot;Iran Ajr&quot;‚Ä≥s mine-laying activities. On 8 October, the U.S. Navy destroyed four Iranian speedboats, and in response to Iranian Silkworm missile attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers, launched Operation Nimble Archer, destroying two Iranian oil rigs in the Persian Gulf. During November and December, the Iraqi air force launched a bid to destroy all Iranian airbases in Khuzestan and the remaining Iranian air force. Iran managed to shoot down 30 Iraqi fighters with fighter jets, anti-aircraft guns, and missiles, allowing the Iranian air force to survive to the end of the war.

On 28 June, Iraqi fighter bombers attacked the Iranian town of Sardasht near the border, using chemical mustard gas bombs. While many towns and cities had been bombed before, and troops attacked with gas, this was the first time that the Iraqis had attacked a civilian area with poison gas. One quarter of the town&#x27;s then population of 20,000 was burned and stricken, and 113 were killed immediately, with many more dying and suffering health effects over following decades.

===1988: Final Iraqi offensives===

By 1988, with massive equipment imports and reduced Iranian volunteers, Iraq was ready to launch major offensives against Iran. In February 1988, Saddam began the fifth and most deadly &quot;war of the cities&quot;. Over the next two months, Iraq launched over 200 al-Husayn missiles at 37 Iranian cities. Saddam also threatened to use chemical weapons in his missiles, which caused 30% of Tehran&#x27;s population to leave the city. Iran retaliated, launching at least 104 missiles against Iraq in 1988 and shelling Basra. This event was nicknamed the &quot;Scud Duel&quot; in the foreign media. In all, Iraq launched 520 Scuds and al-Husseins against Iran and Iran fired 177 in return. The Iranian attacks were too few in number to deter Iraq from launching their attacks. Iraq also increased their airstrikes against Kharg Island and Iranian oil tankers. With their tankers protected by U.S. warships, they could operate with virtual impunity. In addition, the West supplied Iraq&#x27;s air force with laser-guided smart bombs, allowing them to attack economic targets while evading anti-aircraft defenses. These attacks began to have a major toll on the Iranian economy and morale and caused many casualties.

====Iran&#x27;s Kurdistan Operations====

In March 1988, the Iranians carried out Operation Dawn 10, Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas 2, and Operation Zafar 7 in Iraqi Kurdistan with the aim of capturing the Darbandikhan Dam and the power plant at Lake Dukan, which supplied Iraq with much of its electricity and water, as well as the city of Suleimaniya. Iran hoped that the capture of these areas would bring more favourable terms to the ceasefire agreement. This infiltration offensive was carried out in conjunction with the Peshmerga. Iranian airborne commandos landed behind the Iraqi lines and Iranian helicopters hit Iraqi tanks with TOW missiles. The Iraqis were taken by surprise, and Iranian F-5E Tiger fighter jets even damaged the Kirkuk oil refinery. Iraq carried out executions of multiple officers for these failures in March‚ÄìApril 1988, including Colonel Jafar Sadeq. The Iranians used infiltration tactics in the Kurdish mountains, captured the town of Halabja and began to fan out across the province.

Though the Iranians advanced to within sight of Dukan and captured around and 4,000 Iraqi troops, the offensive failed due to the Iraqi use of chemical warfare. The Iraqis launched the deadliest chemical weapons attacks of the war. The Republican Guard launched 700 chemical shells, while the other artillery divisions launched 200‚Äì300 chemical shells each, unleashing a chemical cloud over the Iranians, killing or wounding 60% of them, the blow was felt particularly by the Iranian 84th infantry division and 55th paratrooper division. The Iraqi special forces then stopped the remains of the Iranian force. In retaliation for Kurdish collaboration with the Iranians, Iraq launched a massive poison gas attack against Kurdish civilians in Halabja, recently taken by the Iranians, killing thousands of civilians. Iran airlifted foreign journalists to the ruined city, and the images of the dead were shown throughout the world, but Western mistrust of Iran and collaboration with Iraq led them to also blame Iran for the attack.

====Second Battle of al-Faw====

On 17 April 1988, Iraq launched Operation Ramadan Mubarak (Blessed Ramadan), a surprise attack against the 15,000 Basij troops on the al-Faw peninsula. The attack was preceded by Iraqi diversionary attacks in northern Iraq, with a massive artillery and air barrage of Iranian front lines. Key areas, such as supply lines, command posts, and ammunition depots, were hit by a storm of mustard gas and nerve gas, as well as by conventional explosives. Helicopters landed Iraqi commandos behind Iranian lines on al-Faw while the main Iraqi force made a frontal assault. Within 48 hours, all of the Iranian forces had been killed or cleared from the al-Faw Peninsula. The day was celebrated in Iraq as Faw Liberation Day throughout Saddam&#x27;s rule. The Iraqis had planned the offensive well. Prior to the attack, the Iraqi soldiers gave themselves poison gas antidotes to shield themselves from the effect of the saturation of gas. The heavy and well executed use of chemical weapons was the decisive factor in the victory. Iraqi losses were relatively light, especially compared to Iran&#x27;s casualties. Ra&#x27;ad al-Hamdani later recounted that the recapture of al-Faw marked &quot;the highest point of experience and expertise that the Iraqi Army reached.&quot; The Iranians eventually managed to halt the Iraqi drive as they pushed towards Khuzestan.

To the shock of the Iranians, rather than breaking off the offensive, the Iraqis kept up their drive, and a new force attacked the Iranian positions around Basra. Following this, the Iraqis launched a sustained drive to clear the Iranians out of all of southern Iraq. One of the most successful Iraqi tactics was the &quot;one-two punch&quot; attack using chemical weapons. Using artillery, they would saturate the Iranian front line with rapidly dispersing cyanide and nerve gas, while longer-lasting mustard gas was launched via fighter-bombers and rockets against the Iranian rear, creating a &quot;chemical wall&quot; that blocked reinforcement.

====Operation Praying Mantis====

The same day as Iraq&#x27;s attack on al-Faw peninsula, the United States Navy launched Operation Praying Mantis in retaliation against Iran for damaging a warship with a mine. Iran lost oil platforms, destroyers, and frigates in this battle, which ended only when President Reagan decided that the Iranian navy had been damaged enough. In spite of this, the Revolutionary Guard Navy continued their speedboat attacks against oil tankers. The defeats at al-Faw and in the Persian Gulf nudged Iranian leadership towards quitting the war, especially when facing the prospect of fighting the Americans.

====Iranian counteroffensive====
Faced with such losses, Khomeini appointed Rafsanjani as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, though he had in actuality occupied that position for months. Rafsanjani ordered a last desperate counter-attack into Iraq, which was launched 13 June 1988. The Iranians infiltrated through the Iraqi trenches and moved into Iraq and managed to strike Saddam&#x27;s presidential palace in Baghdad using fighter aircraft. After three days of fighting, the decimated Iranians were driven back to their original positions again as the Iraqis launched 650 helicopter and 300 aircraft sorties.

====Operation Forty Stars====

On 18 June 1988, the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) conducted a military operation known as Operation Forty Stars (). In four days, the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran wiped out a Pasdaran division, seizing Mehran and building a bridgehead twelve miles into Iran. According to the MEK, Iraqi soldiers did not participate in the operation. Baghdad also said it was not involved in the battle.

====Tawakalna ala Allah operations====
On 25 May 1988, Iraq launched the first of five Tawakalna ala Allah Operations, consisting of one of the largest artillery barrages in history, coupled with chemical weapons. The marshes had been dried by drought, allowing the Iraqis to use tanks to bypass Iranian field fortifications, expelling the Iranians from the border town of Shalamcheh after less than 10 hours of combat.

On 25 June, Iraq launched the second Tawakal ala Allah operation against the Iranians on Majnoon Island. Iraqi commandos used amphibious craft to block the Iranian rear, then used hundreds of tanks with massed conventional and chemical artillery barrages to recapture the island after 8 hours of combat. Saddam appeared live on Iraqi television to &quot;lead&quot; the charge against the Iranians. The majority of the Iranian defenders were killed during the quick assault. The final two Tawakal ala Allah operations took place near al-Amarah and Khaneqan. By 12 July, the Iraqis had captured the city of Dehloran, inside Iran, along with 2,500 troops and much armour and material, which took four days to transport to Iraq. These losses included more than 570 of the 1,000 remaining Iranian tanks, over 430 armored vehicles, 45 self-propelled artillery, 300 towed artillery pieces, and 320 antiaircraft guns. These figures only included what Iraq could actually put to use; total amount of captured materiel was higher. Since March, the Iraqis claimed to have captured 1,298 tanks, 155 infantry fighting vehicles, 512 heavy artillery pieces, 6,196 mortars, 5,550 recoilless rifles and light guns, 8,050-man-portable rocket launchers, 60,694 rifles, 322 pistols, 454 trucks, and 1,600 light vehicles. The Iraqis withdrew from Dehloran soon after, claiming that they had &quot;no desire to conquer Iranian territory&quot;. History professor Kaveh Farrokh considered this to be Iran&#x27;s greatest military disaster during the war. Stephen Pelletier, a Journalist, Middle East expert, and author, noted that &quot;Tawakal ala Allah ... resulted in the absolute destruction of Iran&#x27;s military machine.&quot;

During the 1988 battles, the Iranians put up little resistance, having been worn out by nearly eight years of war. They lost large amounts of equipment. On 2 July, Iran belatedly set up a joint central command which unified the Revolutionary Guard, Army, and Kurdish rebels, and dispelled the rivalry between the Army and the Revolutionary Guard. However, this came too late and, following the capture of 570 of their operable tanks and the destruction of hundreds more, Iran was believed to have fewer than 200 remaining operable tanks on the southern front, against thousands of Iraqi ones. The only area where the Iranians were not suffering major defeats was in Kurdistan.

===Iran accepts the ceasefire===

Saddam sent a warning to Khomeini in mid-1988, threatening to launch a new and powerful full-scale invasion and attack Iranian cities with weapons of mass destruction. Shortly afterwards, Iraqi aircraft bombed the Iranian town of Oshnavieh with poison gas, immediately killing and wounding over 2,000 civilians. The fear of an all out chemical attack against Iran&#x27;s largely unprotected civilian population weighed heavily on the Iranian leadership, and they realized that the international community had no intention of restraining Iraq. The lives of the civilian population of Iran were becoming very disrupted, with a third of the urban population evacuating major cities in fear of the seemingly imminent chemical war. Meanwhile, Iraqi conventional bombs and missiles continuously hit towns and cities, destroying vital civilian and military infrastructure, and increasing the death toll. Iran replied with missile and air attacks, but not sufficiently to deter the Iraqis.

With the threat of a new and even more powerful invasion, Commander-in-Chief Rafsanjani ordered the Iranians to retreat from Haj Omran, Kurdistan on 14 July. The Iranians did not publicly describe this as a retreat, instead calling it a &quot;temporary withdrawal&quot;. By July, Iran&#x27;s army inside Iraq had largely disintegrated. Iraq put up a massive display of captured Iranian weapons in Baghdad, claiming they captured 1,298 tanks, 5,550 recoilless rifles, and thousands of other weapons. However, Iraq had taken heavy losses as well, and the battles were very costly.

In July 1988, Iraqi aircraft dropped bombs on the Iranian Kurdish village of Zardan. Dozens of villages, such as Sardasht, and some larger towns, such as Marivan, Baneh and Saqqez, were once again attacked with poison gas, resulting in even heavier civilian casualties. On 3 July 1988, the USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; shot down Iran Air Flight 655, killing 290 passengers and crew. The lack of international sympathy disturbed the Iranian leadership, and they came to the conclusion that the United States was on the verge of waging a full-scale war against them, and that Iraq was on the verge of unleashing its entire chemical arsenal upon their cities.

At this point, elements of the Iranian leadership, led by Rafsanjani (who had initially pushed for the extension of the war), persuaded Khomeini to accept a ceasefire. They stated that in order to win the war, Iran&#x27;s military budget would have to be increased eightfold and the war would last until 1993. On 20 July 1988, Iran accepted Resolution 598, showing its willingness to accept a ceasefire. A statement from Khomeini was read out in a radio address, and he expressed deep displeasure and reluctance about accepting the ceasefire,

Happy are those who have departed through martyrdom. Happy are those who have lost their lives in this convoy of light. Unhappy am I that I still survive and have drunk the poisoned chalice...

The news of the end of the war was greeted with celebration in Baghdad, with people dancing in the streets; in Tehran, however, the end of the war was greeted with a somber mood.

====Operation Mersad and end of the war====
Operation Mersad ( &quot;ambush&quot;) was the last big military operation of the war. Both Iran and Iraq had accepted Resolution 598, but despite the ceasefire, after seeing Iraqi victories in the previous months, Mujahadeen-e-Khalq (MEK) decided to launch an attack of its own and wished to advance all the way to Tehran. Saddam and the Iraqi high command decided on a two-pronged offensive across the border into central Iran and Iranian Kurdistan. Shortly after Iran accepted the ceasefire, the MEK army began its offensive, attacking into Ilam province under cover of Iraqi air power. In the north, Iraq also launched an attack into Iraqi Kurdistan, which was blunted by the Iranians.

On 26 July 1988, the MEK started their campaign in central Iran, Operation Forough Javidan (Eternal Light), with the support of the Iraqi army. The Iranians had withdrawn their remaining soldiers to Khuzestan in fear of a new Iraqi invasion attempt, allowing the Mujahedeen to advance rapidly towards Kermanshah, seizing Qasr-e Shirin, Sarpol-e Zahab, Kerend-e Gharb, and Islamabad-e-Gharb. The MEK expected the Iranian population to rise up and support their advance; the uprising never materialised but they reached deep into Iran. In response, the Iranian military launched its counter-attack, Operation Mersad, under Lieutenant General Ali Sayyad Shirazi. Iranian paratroopers landed behind the MEK lines while the Iranian Air Force and helicopters launched an air attack, destroying much of the enemy columns. The Iranians defeated the MEK in the city of Kerend-e Gharb on 29 July 1988. On 31 July, Iran drove the MEK out of Qasr-e-Shirin and Sarpol Zahab, though MEK claimed to have &quot;voluntarily withdrawn&quot; from the towns. Iran estimated that 4,500 MEK were killed, while 400 Iranian soldiers died.

The last notable combat actions of the war took place on 3 August 1988, in the Persian Gulf when the Iranian navy fired on a freighter and Iraq launched chemical attacks on Iranian civilians, killing an unknown number of them and wounding 2,300. Iraq came under international pressure to curtail further offensives. Resolution 598 became effective on 8 August 1988, ending all combat operations between the two countries. By 20 August 1988, peace with Iran was restored. UN peacekeepers belonging to the UNIIMOG mission took the field, remaining on the Iran‚ÄìIraq border until 1991. The majority of Western analysts believe that the war had no winners while some believed that Iraq emerged as the victor of the war, based on Iraq&#x27;s overwhelming successes between April and July 1988. While the war was now over, Iraq spent the rest of August and early September clearing the Kurdish resistance. Using 60,000 troops along with helicopter gunships, chemical weapons (poison gas), and mass executions, Iraq hit 15 villages, killing rebels and civilians, and forced tens of thousands of Kurds to relocate to settlements. Many Kurdish civilians fled to Iran. By 3 September 1988, the anti-Kurd campaign ended, and all resistance had been crushed. 400 Iraqi soldiers and 50,000‚Äì100,000 Kurdish civilians and soldiers had been killed.

At the war&#x27;s conclusion, it took several weeks for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran to evacuate Iraqi territory to honor pre-war international borders set by the 1975 Algiers Agreement. The last prisoners of war were exchanged in 2003.

The Security Council did not identify Iraq as the aggressor of the war until 11 December 1991, some 11 years after Iraq invaded Iran and 16 months following Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait.

==Aftermath==
===Casualties===
The Iran‚ÄìIraq War was the deadliest conventional war ever fought between regular armies of developing countries. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica states: &quot;Estimates of total casualties range from 1,000,000 to twice that number. The number killed on both sides was perhaps 500,000, with Iran suffering the greatest losses.&quot; Iraqi casualties are estimated at 105,000‚Äì200,000 killed, while about 400,000 had been wounded and some 70,000 taken prisoner. Thousands of civilians on both sides died in air raids and ballistic missile attacks. Prisoners taken by both countries began to be released on 17 August 1990, though some were not released until more than 10 years after the end of the conflict. Cities on both sides had also been considerably damaged. While revolutionary Iran had been bloodied, Iraq was left with a large military and was a regional power, albeit with severe debt, financial problems, and labour shortages.

According to Iranian government sources, the war cost Iran an estimated 200,000‚Äì220,000 killed, or up to 262,000 according to the conservative Western estimates. This includes 123,220 combatants, 60,711 MIA and 11,000‚Äì16,000 civilians. Combatants include 79,664 members of the Revolutionary Guard Corps and additional 35,170 soldiers from regular military. In addition, prisoners of war accounted for 42,875 Iranian casualties, captured and kept in Iraqi detention centres from 2.5 to more than 15 years after the war was over.

According to the Janbazan Affairs Organization, 398,587 Iranians sustained injuries that required prolonged medical and health care following primary treatment, including 52,195 (13%) injured due to the exposure to chemical warfare agents. From 1980 to 2012, 218,867 Iranians died due to war injuries and the mean age of combatants was 23 years old. This includes 33,430 civilians, mostly women and children. More than 144,000 Iranian children were orphaned as a consequence of these deaths. Other estimates put Iranian casualties up to 600,000.

Both Iraq and Iran manipulated loss figures to suit their purposes. At the same time, Western analysts accepted improbable estimates. By April 1988, such casualties were estimated at between 150,000 and 340,000 Iraqis dead, and 450,000 to 730,000 Iranians. Shortly after the end of the war, it was thought that Iran suffered even more than a million dead. Considering the style of fighting on the ground and the fact that neither side penetrated deeply into the other&#x27;s territory, USMC analysts believe events do not substantiate the high casualties claimed. The Iraqi government has claimed 800,000 Iranians were killed in action, four times more than Iranian official figures, whereas Iraqi intelligence privately put the number at 228,000‚Äì258,000 as of August 1986. Iraqi losses were also revised downwards over time.

===Peace talks and postwar situation===

With the ceasefire in place, and UN peacekeepers monitoring the border, Iran and Iraq sent their representatives to Geneva, Switzerland, to negotiate a peace agreement on the terms of the ceasefire. However, peace talks stalled. Iraq, in violation of the UN ceasefire, refused to withdraw its troops from of disputed territory at the border area unless the Iranians accepted Iraq&#x27;s full sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab waterway. Foreign powers continued to support Iraq, which wanted to gain at the negotiating table what they failed to achieve on the battlefield, and Iran was portrayed as the one not wanting peace.

In response, Iran refused to release 70,000 Iraqi prisoners of war, compared to 40,000 Iranian prisoners of war held by Iraq. They continued to carry out a naval blockade of Iraq, although its effects were mitigated by Iraqi use of ports in friendly neighbouring Arab countries. Iran began to improve relations with many of the states that opposed it during the war. Because of Iranian actions, by 1990, Saddam had become more conciliatory, and in a letter to the future fourth President of Iran Rafsanjani, he became more open to the idea of a peace agreement, although he still insisted on full sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab.

By 1990, Iran was undergoing military rearmament and reorganization, and purchased $10¬†billion worth of heavy weaponry from the USSR and China, including aircraft, tanks, and missiles. Rafsanjani reversed Iran&#x27;s self-imposed ban on chemical weapons, and ordered the manufacture and stockpile of them (Iran destroyed them in 1993 after ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention). As war with the western powers loomed, Iraq became concerned about the possibility of Iran mending its relations with the west in order to attack Iraq. Iraq had lost its support from the West, and its position in Iran was increasingly untenable. Saddam realized that if Iran attempted to expel the Iraqis from the disputed territories in the border area, it was likely they would succeed.

Shortly after his invasion of Kuwait, Saddam wrote a letter to Rafsanjani stating that Iraq recognised Iranian rights over the eastern half of the Shatt al-Arab, a reversion to &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot; that he had repudiated a decade earlier, and that he would accept Iran&#x27;s demands and withdraw Iraq&#x27;s military from the disputed territories. A peace agreement was signed finalizing the terms of the UN resolution, diplomatic relations were restored, and by late 1990-early 1991, the Iraqi military withdrew. The UN peacekeepers withdrew from the border shortly afterward. Most of the prisoners of war were released in 1990, although some remained as late as 2003. Iranian politicians declared it to be the &quot;greatest victory in the history of the Islamic Republic of Iran&quot;.

Most historians and analysts consider the war to be a stalemate. Certain analysts believe that Iraq won, on the basis of the successes of their 1988 offensives which thwarted Iran&#x27;s major territorial ambitions in Iraq and persuaded Iran to accept the ceasefire. Iranian analysts believe that they won the war because although they did not succeed in overthrowing the Iraqi government, they thwarted Iraq&#x27;s major territorial ambitions in Iran, and that, two years after the war had ended, Iraq permanently gave up its claim of ownership over the entire Shatt al-Arab as well.

On 9 December 1991, Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar, UN Secretary General at the time, reported that Iraq&#x27;s initiation of the war was unjustified, as was its occupation of Iranian territory and use of chemical weapons against civilians:

That [Iraq&#x27;s] explanations do not appear sufficient or acceptable to the international community is a fact...[the attack] cannot be justified under the charter of the United Nations, any recognized rules and principles of international law, or any principles of international morality, and entails the responsibility for conflict. Even if before the outbreak of the conflict there had been some encroachment by Iran on Iraqi territory, such encroachment did not justify Iraq&#x27;s aggression against Iran‚Äîwhich was followed by Iraq&#x27;s continuous occupation of Iranian territory during the conflict‚Äîin violation of the prohibition of the use of force, which is regarded as one of the rules of jus cogens...On one occasion I had to note with deep regret the experts&#x27; conclusion that &quot;chemical weapons ha[d] been used against Iranian civilians in an area adjacent to an urban center lacking any protection against that kind of attack.&quot;

He also stated that had the UN accepted this fact earlier, the war would have almost certainly not lasted as long as it did. Iran, encouraged by the announcement, sought reparations from Iraq, but never received any.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Iran and Iraq relations remained balanced between a cold war and a cold peace. Despite renewed and somewhat thawed relations, both sides continued to have low level conflicts. Iraq continued to host and support the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, which carried out multiple attacks throughout Iran up until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the assassination of Iranian general Ali Sayyad Shirazi in 1999, cross border raids, and mortar attacks. Iran carried out several airstrikes and missile attacks against Mujahedeen targets inside of Iraq, the largest taking place in 2001, when Iran fired 56 Scud missiles at Mujahedeen targets.

According to General Hamdani, Iran continued to carry out low-level infiltrations of Iraqi territory, using Iraqi dissidents and anti-government activists rather than Iranian troops, in order to incite revolts. After the fall of Saddam in 2003, Hamdani claimed that Iranian agents infiltrated and created numerous militias in Iraq and built an intelligence system operating within the country.

In 2005, the new government of Iraq apologised to Iran for starting the war. The Iraqi government also commemorated the war with various monuments, including the Hands of Victory and the al-Shaheed Monument, both in Baghdad. The war also helped to create a forerunner for the Coalition of the Gulf War, when the Gulf Arab states banded together early in the war to form the Gulf Cooperation Council to help Iraq fight Iran.

===Economic situation===
The economic loss at the time was believed to exceed $500¬†billion for each country ($1.2¬†trillion total). In addition, economic development stalled and oil exports were disrupted. Iraq had accrued more than $130¬†billion of international debt, excluding interest, and was also weighed down by a slowed GDP growth. Iraq&#x27;s debt to the Paris Club amounted to $21¬†billion, 85% of which had originated from the combined inputs of Japan, the USSR, France, Germany, the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom. The largest portion of Iraq&#x27;s debt, amounting to $130¬†billion, was to its former Arab backers, with $67¬†billion loaned by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, and Jordan.

After the war, Iraq accused Kuwait of slant drilling and stealing oil, inciting its invasion of Kuwait, which in turn worsened Iraq&#x27;s financial situation: the United Nations Compensation Commission mandated Iraq to pay reparations of more than $200¬†billion to victims of the invasion, including Kuwait and the United States. To enforce payment, Iraq was put under a comprehensive international embargo, which further strained the Iraqi economy and pushed its external debt to private and public sectors to more than $500¬†billion by the end of Saddam&#x27;s rule. Combined with Iraq&#x27;s negative economic growth after prolonged international sanctions, this produced a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 1,000%, making Iraq the most indebted developing country in the world. The unsustainable economic situation compelled the new Iraqi government to request that a considerable portion of debt incurred during the Iran‚ÄìIraq war be written off.

===Science and technology===

The war had its impact on medical science: a surgical intervention for comatose patients with penetrating brain injuries was created by Iranian physicians treating wounded soldiers, later establishing neurosurgery guidelines to treat civilians who had suffered blunt or penetrating skull injuries. Iranian physicians&#x27; experience in the war informed the medical care of U.S. congresswoman Gabby Giffords after the 2011 Tucson shooting.

In addition to helping trigger the Persian Gulf War, the Iran‚ÄìIraq War also contributed to Iraq&#x27;s defeat in the Persian Gulf War. Iraq&#x27;s military was accustomed to fighting the slow moving Iranian infantry formations with artillery and static defenses, while using mostly unsophisticated tanks to gun down and shell the infantry and overwhelm the smaller Iranian tank force; in addition to being dependent on weapons of mass destruction to help secure victories. Therefore, they were rapidly overwhelmed by the high-tech, quick-maneuvering Coalition forces using modern doctrines such as AirLand Battle.

==Domestic situation==
===Iraq===

At first, Saddam attempted to ensure that the Iraqi population suffered from the war as little as possible. There was rationing, but civilian projects begun before the war continued. At the same time, the already extensive personality cult around Saddam reached new heights while the regime tightened its control over the military.

After the Iranian victories of the spring of 1982 and the Syrian closure of Iraq&#x27;s main pipeline, Saddam did a volte-face on his policy towards the home front: a policy of austerity and total war was introduced, with the entire population being mobilised for the war effort. All Iraqis were ordered to donate blood and around 100,000 Iraqi civilians were ordered to clear the reeds in the southern marshes. Mass demonstrations of loyalty towards Saddam became more common. Saddam also began implementing a policy of discrimination against Iraqis of Iranian origin.

In the summer of 1982, Saddam began a campaign of terror. More than 300 Iraqi Army officers were executed for their failures on the battlefield. In 1983, a major crackdown was launched on the leadership of the Shia community. Ninety members of the al-Hakim family, an influential family of Shia clerics whose leading members were the √©migr√©s Mohammad Baqir al-Hakim and Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, were arrested, and six were hanged.

The crackdown on Kurds saw 8,000 members of the Barzani clan, whose leader (Massoud Barzani) also led the Kurdistan Democratic Party, similarly executed. From 1983 onwards, a campaign of increasingly brutal repression was started against the Iraqi Kurds, characterised by Israeli historian Efraim Karsh as having &quot;assumed genocidal proportions&quot; by 1988. The Anfal campaign was intended to &quot;pacify&quot; Iraqi Kurdistan permanently. By 1983, the Barzanis entered an alliance with Iran in defense against Saddam Hussein.

====Gaining civilian support====
To secure the loyalty of the Shia population, Saddam allowed more Shias into the Ba&#x27;ath Party and the government, and improved Shia living standards, which had been lower than those of the Iraqi Sunnis. Saddam had the state pay for restoring Imam Ali&#x27;s tomb with white marble imported from Italy. The Baathists also increased their policies of repression against the Shia. The most infamous event was the massacre of 148 civilians of the Shia town of Dujail.

Despite the costs of the war, the Iraqi regime made generous contributions to Shia &quot;waqf&quot; (religious endowments) as part of the price of buying Iraqi Shia support. The importance of winning Shia support was such that welfare services in Shia areas were expanded during a time in which the Iraqi regime was pursuing austerity in all other non-military fields. During the first years of the war in the early 1980s, the Iraqi government tried to accommodate the Kurds in order to focus on the war against Iran. In 1983, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan agreed to cooperate with Baghdad, but the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) remained opposed. In 1983, Saddam signed an autonomy agreement with Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), though Saddam later reneged on the agreement. By 1985, the PUK and KDP had joined forces, and Iraqi Kurdistan saw widespread guerrilla warfare up to the end of the war.

===Iran===

Israeli-British historian Ephraim Karsh argued that the Iranian government saw the outbreak of war as chance to strengthen its position and consolidate the Islamic revolution, noting that government propaganda presented it domestically as a glorious &quot;jihad&quot; and a test of Iranian national character. The Iranian regime followed a policy of total war from the beginning, and attempted to mobilise the nation as a whole. They established a group known as the Reconstruction Campaign, whose members were exempted from conscription and were instead sent into the countryside to work on farms to replace the men serving at the front.

Iranian workers had a day&#x27;s pay deducted from their pay cheques every month to help finance the war, and mass campaigns were launched to encourage the public to donate food, money, and blood. To further help finance the war, the Iranian government banned the import of all non-essential items, and launched a major effort to rebuild the damaged oil plants.

According to former Iraqi general Ra&#x27;ad al-Hamdani, the Iraqis believed that in addition to the Arab revolts, the Revolutionary Guards would be drawn out of Tehran, leading to a counter-revolution in Iran that would cause Khomeini&#x27;s government to collapse and thus ensure Iraqi victory. However, rather than turning against the revolutionary government as experts had predicted, Iran&#x27;s people (including Iranian Arabs) rallied in support of the country and put up a stiff resistance.

The IRGC grew as an organization to encompass not just military concerns but also matters of economic, religious, and educational importance. The organization&#x27;s growth during the war is vital to understanding the organization&#x27;s role in Iranian society and how it has evolved since its initial formation in 1979. Domestically, the IRGC dealt with suppressing uprisings by Kurds, Baluchs, Turkmen, and the Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) which broke with Khomeini in June 1981. While initially dealing with internal threats to the revolution in its first few years, the IRGC focused its attention on external threats at the outbreak of the war in 1980. In January 1981, the IRGC would take control of the Basij to aid in the fight against Iraqi forces. The Basij helped bolster the prominence and legitimacy of the IRGC during the war as a vehicle for indoctrination and through its contributions to the defense of Iran. The transformation of the IRGC organized its command structure which allowed for the organization to match the force of Iran&#x27;s regular military and its first abroad deployment during the war began the sponsoring of other armed groups in the region through its command of the Quds force.

====Civil unrest====
In June 1981, street battles broke out between the Revolutionary Guard and the left-wing Mujaheddin e-Khalq (MEK), continuing for several days and killing hundreds on both sides. In September, more unrest broke out on the streets of Iran as the MEK attempted to seize power. Thousands of left-wing Iranians (many of whom were not associated with the MEK) were shot and hanged by the government. The MEK began an assassination campaign that killed hundreds of regime officials by the fall of 1981. On 28 June 1981, they assassinated the secretary-general of the Islamic Republican Party, Mohammad Beheshti and on 30 August, killed Iran&#x27;s president, Mohammad-Ali Rajai. The government responded with mass executions of suspected MEK members, a practice that lasted until 1985.

In addition to the open civil conflict with the MEK, the Iranian government was faced with Iraqi-supported rebellions in Iranian Kurdistan, which were gradually put down through a campaign of systematic repression. 1985 also saw student anti-war demonstrations, which were crushed by government forces.

====Economy====
In September 2020, Ali Fadavi announced that Iran spent $19.6 billion in the war. The war furthered the decline of the Iranian economy that had begun with the revolution in 1978‚Äì79. Between 1979 and 1981, foreign exchange reserves fell from $14.6¬†billion to $1¬†billion. As a result of the war, living standards dropped dramatically, and Iran was described by British journalists John Bulloch and Harvey Morris as &quot;a dour and joyless place&quot; ruled by a harsh regime that &quot;seemed to have nothing to offer but endless war&quot;.

Though Iran was becoming bankrupt, Khomeini interpreted Islam&#x27;s prohibition of usury to mean they could not borrow against future oil revenues to meet war expenses. As a result, Iran funded the war by the income from oil exports after cash had run out. The revenue from oil dropped from $20¬†billion in 1982 to $5¬†billion in 1988. French historian Pierre Razoux argued that this sudden drop in economic industrial potential, in conjunction with the increasing aggression of Iraq, placed Iran in a challenging position that had little leeway other than accepting Iraq&#x27;s conditions of peace.

In January 1985, former prime minister and anti-war Islamic Liberation Movement co-founder Mehdi Bazargan criticised the war in a telegram to the United Nations, calling it un-Islamic and illegitimate and arguing that Khomeini should have accepted Saddam&#x27;s truce offer in 1982 instead of attempting to overthrow the Ba&#x27;ath. In a public letter to Khomeini sent in May 1988, he added &quot;Since 1986, you have not stopped proclaiming victory, and now you are calling upon population to resist until victory. Is that not an admission of failure on your part?&quot; Khomeini was annoyed by Bazargan&#x27;s telegram, and issued a lengthy public rebuttal in which he defended the war as both Islamic and just.

By 1987, Iranian morale had begun to crumble, reflected in the failure of government campaigns to recruit &quot;martyrs&quot; for the front. Israeli historian Efraim Karsh points to the decline in morale in 1987‚Äì88 as being a major factor in Iran&#x27;s decision to accept the ceasefire of 1988.

Not all saw the war in negative terms. The Islamic Revolution of Iran was strengthened and radicalised. The Iranian government-owned &quot;Etelaat&quot; newspaper wrote, &quot;There is not a single school or town that is excluded from the happiness of &#x27;holy defence&#x27; of the nation, from drinking the exquisite elixir of martyrdom, or from the sweet death of the martyr, who dies in order to live forever in paradise.&quot;

==Comparison of Iraqi and Iranian military strength==
Iran&#x27;s regular Army had been purged after the 1979 Revolution, with most high-ranking officers either having fled the country or been executed.

At the beginning of the war, Iraq held a clear advantage in armour, while both nations were roughly equal in terms of artillery. The gap only widened as the war went on. Iran started with a stronger air force, but over time, the balance of power reversed in Iraq&#x27;s favour (as Iraq was constantly expanding its military, while Iran was under arms sanctions). Estimates for 1980 and 1987 were:

The conflict has been compared to World War I in terms of the tactics used, including large-scale trench warfare with barbed wire stretched across trenches, manned machine gun posts, bayonet charges, human wave attacks across a no man&#x27;s land, and extensive use of chemical weapons such as sulfur mustard by the Iraqi government against Iranian troops, civilians, and Kurds. The world powers United States and the Soviet Union, together with many Western and Arab countries, provided military, intelligence, economic, and political support for Iraq. On average, Iraq imported about $7 billion in weapons during every year of the war, accounting for fully 12% of global arms sales in the period.

The value of Iraqi arms imports increased to between $12 billion and $14 billion during 1984‚Äì1987, whereas the value of Iranian arms imports fell from $14 billion in 1985 to $5.89 billion in 1986 and an estimated $6 billion to $8 billion in 1987. Iran was constrained by the price of oil during the 1980s oil glut as foreign countries were largely unwilling to extend credit to Iran, but Iraq financed its continued massive military expansion by taking on vast quantities of debt that allowed it to win a number of victories against Iran near the end of the war but that left the country bankrupt.

Despite its larger population, by 1988 Iran&#x27;s ground forces numbered only 600,000 whereas the Iraqi army had grown to include 1 million soldiers.

==Foreign support to Iraq and Iran==


During the war, Iraq was regarded by the West and the Soviet Union as a counterbalance to post-revolutionary Iran. The Soviet Union, Iraq&#x27;s main arms supplier during the war, did not wish for the end of its alliance with Iraq, and was alarmed by Saddam&#x27;s threats to find new arms suppliers in the West and China if the Kremlin did not provide him with the weapons he wanted. The Soviet Union hoped to use the threat of reducing arms supplies to Iraq as leverage for forming a Soviet‚ÄìIranian alliance.

During the early years of the war, the United States lacked meaningful relations with either Iran or Iraq, the former due to the Iranian revolution and the Iran hostage crisis and the latter because of Iraq&#x27;s alliance with the Soviet Union and hostility towards Israel. Following Iran&#x27;s success in repelling the Iraqi invasion and Khomeini&#x27;s refusal to end the war in 1982, the United States made an outreach to Iraq, beginning with the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1984. The United States wished to both keep Iran away from Soviet influence and protect other Gulf states from any threat of Iranian expansion. As a result, the U.S. began to provide limited support to Iraq. In 1982, Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of State, outlined U.S. policy towards Iran:

The focus of Iranian pressure at this moment is Iraq. There are few governments in the world less deserving of our support and less capable of using it. Had Iraq won the war, the fear in the Gulf and the threat to our interest would be scarcely less than it is today. Still, given the importance of the balance of power in the area, it is in our interests to promote a ceasefire in that conflict; though not a cost that will preclude an eventual rapprochement with Iran either if a more moderate regime replaces Khomeini&#x27;s or if the present rulers wake up to geopolitical reality that the historic threat to Iran&#x27;s independence has always come from the country with which it shares a border of : the Soviet Union. A rapprochement with Iran, of course, must await at a minimum Iran&#x27;s abandonment of hegemonic aspirations in the Gulf.

Richard Murphy, Assistant Secretary of State during the war, testified to Congress in 1984 that the Reagan administration believed a victory for either Iran or Iraq was &quot;neither militarily feasible nor strategically desirable&quot;.

Support to Iraq was given via technological aid, intelligence, the sale of dual-use chemical and biological warfare related technology and military equipment, and satellite intelligence. While there was direct combat between Iran and the United States, it is not universally agreed that the fighting between the United States and Iran was specifically to benefit Iraq, or for separate issues between the U.S. and Iran. American official ambiguity towards which side to support was summed up by Henry Kissinger when he remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s a pity they can&#x27;t both lose.&quot;

More than 30 countries provided support to Iraq, Iran, or both; most of the aid went to Iraq. Iran had a complex clandestine procurement network to obtain munitions and critical materials. Iraq had an even larger clandestine purchasing network, involving 10‚Äì12 allied countries, to maintain ambiguity over their arms purchases and to circumvent &quot;official restrictions&quot;. Arab mercenaries and volunteers from Egypt and Jordan formed the Yarmouk Brigade and participated in the war alongside Iraqis.

===Iraq===


According to the Stockholm International Peace Institute, the Soviet Union, France, and China together accounted for over 90% of the value of Iraq&#x27;s arms imports between 1980 and 1988.

The United States pursued policies in favour of Iraq by reopening diplomatic channels, lifting restrictions on the export of dual-use technology, overseeing the transfer of third-party military hardware, and providing operational intelligence on the battlefield. France, which from the 1970s had been one of Iraq&#x27;s closest allies, was a major supplier of military hardware. The French sold weapons equal to $5¬†billion, which made up well over a quarter of Iraq&#x27;s total arms stockpile. Citing French magazine &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot; as the primary source, but also quoting French officials, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported France had been sending chemical precursors of chemical weapons to Iraq, since 1986. China, which had no direct stake in the victory of either side and whose interests in the war were entirely commercial, freely sold arms to both sides.

Iraq also made extensive use of front companies, middlemen, secret ownership of all or part of companies all over the world, forged end-user certificates, and other methods to hide what it was acquiring. Some transactions may have involved people, shipping, and manufacturing in as many as 10 countries. Support from Great Britain exemplified the methods by which Iraq would circumvent export controls. Iraq bought at least one British company with operations in the United Kingdom and the United States, and had a complex relationship with France and the Soviet Union, its major suppliers of actual weapons.

Turkey took action against the Kurds in 1986, alleging they were attacking the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK), which prompted a harsh diplomatic intervention by Iran, which planned a new offensive against Iraq at the time and were counting on the support of Kurdish factions.

Sudan supported Iraq directly during the war, sending a contingent to fight at the frontlines. The Sudanese unit consisted to a large degree of Ugandan refugees from the West Nile Region, recruited by Juma Oris.

The United Nations Security Council initially called for a cease-fire after a week of fighting while Iraq was occupying Iranian territory, and renewed the call on later occasions. However, the UN did not come to Iran&#x27;s aid to repel the Iraqi invasion, and the Iranians thus interpreted the UN as subtly biased in favour of Iraq.

====Financial support====
Iraq&#x27;s main financial backers were the oil-rich Persian Gulf states, most notably Saudi Arabia ($30.9¬†billion), Kuwait ($8.2¬†billion), and the United Arab Emirates ($8¬†billion). In all, Iraq received $35¬†billion in loans from the West and between $30 and $40¬†billion from the Persian Gulf states during the 1980s.

The Iraqgate scandal revealed that a branch of Italy&#x27;s largest bank, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), in Atlanta, Georgia, relied partially on U.S. taxpayer-guaranteed loans to funnel $5¬†billion to Iraq from 1985 to 1989. In August 1989, when FBI agents raided the Atlanta branch of BNL, branch manager Christopher Drogoul was charged with making unauthorised, clandestine, and illegal loans to Iraq‚Äîsome of which, according to his indictment, were used to purchase arms and weapons technology. According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Hewlett-Packard, Tektronix, and Matrix Churchill&#x27;s branch in Ohio were among the companies shipping militarily useful technology to Iraq under the eye of the U.S. government.

===Iran===

While the United States directly fought Iran, citing freedom of navigation as a major &quot;casus belli&quot;, it also indirectly supplied some weapons to Iran as part of a complex and illegal programme that became known as the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. These secret sales were partly to help secure the release of hostages held in Lebanon, and partly to make money to help the Contras rebel group in Nicaragua. This arms-for-hostages agreement turned into a major scandal.

Israel supported Iran in its war against Iraq through the supply of military equipment including spare parts for fighter jets, missile systems, ammunition and tank engines. Israel&#x27;s motivations for supporting Iran stemmed from a fear of what would have become if Iraq came out victorious and as an opportunity to create business for the Israeli arms industry.

North Korea was a major arms supplier to Iran, often acting as a third party in arms deals between Iran and the Communist bloc. Support included domestically manufactured arms and Eastern-Bloc weapons, for which the major powers wanted deniability. Among the other arms suppliers and supporters of Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolution, the major ones were Libya, Syria, and China. According to the Stockholm International Peace Institute, China was the largest foreign arms supplier to Iran between 1980 and 1988.

Syria and Libya, breaking Arab solidarity, supported Iran with arms, rhetoric and diplomacy. However, Libya then distanced itself from Iran from 1987, criticizing Tehran&#x27;s attitude and restoring diplomatic relations with Iraq.

===Aid to both countries===

Besides the United States and the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia also sold weapons to both countries for the entire duration of the conflict. Likewise, Portugal helped both countries; it was not unusual to see Iranian and Iraqi flagged ships anchored at Set√∫bal, waiting their turn to dock.

From 1980 to 1987, Spain sold ‚Ç¨458¬†million in weapons to Iran and ‚Ç¨172¬†million to Iraq. Weapons sold to Iraq included 4x4 vehicles, BO-105 helicopters, explosives, and ammunition. A research party later discovered that an unexploded chemical Iraqi warhead in Iran was manufactured in Spain.

Although neither side acquired any weapons from Turkey, both sides enjoyed Turkish civilian trade during the conflict, although the Turkish government remained neutral and refused to support the U.S.-imposed trade embargo on Iran. Turkey&#x27;s export market jumped from $220¬†million in 1981 to $2¬†billion in 1985, making up 25% of Turkey&#x27;s overall exports. Turkish construction projects in Iraq totaled $2.5¬†billion between 1974 and 1990. Trading with both countries helped Turkey to offset its ongoing economic crisis, though the benefits decreased as the war neared its end and accordingly disappeared entirely with Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait and the resulting Iraq sanctions Turkey imposed in response.

==U.S. involvement==

American support for Ba&#x27;athist Iraq during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, in which it fought against post-revolutionary Iran, included several billion dollars&#x27; worth of economic aid, the sale of dual-use technology, non-U.S. origin weaponry, military intelligence, and special operations training. The U.S. refused to sell arms to Iraq directly due to Iraq&#x27;s ties to terrorist groups, but several sales of &quot;dual-use&quot; technology have been documented; notably, Iraq purchased 45 Bell helicopters for $200 million in 1985. Total sales of U.S. dual-use technology to Iraq are estimated at $500 million.

U.S. government support for Iraq was not a secret and was frequently discussed in open sessions of the Senate and House of Representatives. American views toward Iraq were not enthusiastically supportive in its conflict with Iran, and activity in assistance was largely to prevent an Iranian victory. This was encapsulated by Henry Kissinger when he remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s a pity they both can&#x27;t lose.&quot;

===U.S. embargo===

A key element of U.S. political‚Äìmilitary and energy‚Äìeconomic planning occurred in early 1983. The Iran‚ÄìIraq war had been going on for three years and there were significant casualties on both sides, reaching hundreds of thousands. Within the Reagan National Security Council concern was growing that the war could spread beyond the boundaries of the two belligerents. A National Security Planning Group meeting was called chaired by Vice President George Bush to review U.S. options. It was determined that there was a high likelihood that the conflict would spread into Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, but that the United States had little capability to defend the region.

It was determined that a prolonged war in the region would induce much higher oil prices and threaten the fragile world recovery which was just beginning to gain momentum. On 22 May 1984, President Reagan was briefed on the project conclusions in the Oval Office by William Flynn Martin who had served as the head of the NSC staff that organized the study. The full declassified presentation can be seen here.

The conclusions were threefold: firstly, oil stocks needed to be increased among members of the International Energy Agency and, if necessary, released early in the event of oil market disruption; second, the United States needed to reinforce the security of friendly Arab states in the region; and thirdly, an embargo should be placed on sales of military equipment to Iran and Iraq. The plan was approved by the President and later affirmed by the G-7 leaders headed by Margaret Thatcher in the London Summit of 1984.

===U.S. knowledge of Iraqi chemical weapons use===

According to &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, the &quot;Iraqis used mustard gas and sarin prior to four major offensives in early 1988 that relied on U.S. satellite imagery, maps, and other intelligence. ... According to recently declassified CIA documents and interviews with former intelligence officials like Francona, the U.S. had firm evidence of Iraqi chemical attacks beginning in 1983.&quot;

===Iraqi attack on U.S. warship===


On 17 May 1987, an Iraqi Dassault Mirage F1 fighter jet launched two Exocet missiles at , a &quot;Perry&quot; class frigate. The first struck the port side of the ship and failed to explode, though it left burning propellant in its wake; the second struck moments later in approximately the same place and penetrated through to crew quarters, where it exploded, killing 37 crew members and leaving 21 injured. Whether or not Iraqi leadership authorised the attack is still unknown. Initial claims by the Iraqi government that &quot;Stark&quot; was inside the Iran‚ÄìIraq War zone were shown to be false, and the motives and orders of the pilot remain unanswered.

Though American officials claimed that the pilot who attacked &quot;Stark&quot; had been executed, an ex-Iraqi Air Force commander since stated he had not been punished, and was still alive at the time. The attack remains the only successful anti-ship missile strike on an American warship. Due to the extensive political and military cooperation between the Iraqis and Americans by 1987, the attack had little effect on relations between the two countries.

===U.S. military actions toward Iran===

U.S. attention was focused on isolating Iran as well as maintaining freedom of navigation. It criticised Iran&#x27;s mining of international waters, and sponsored , which passed unanimously on 20 July, under which the U.S. and Iranian forces skirmished during Operation Earnest Will. During Operation Nimble Archer in October 1987, the United States attacked Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker &quot;Sea Isle City&quot;.

On 14 April 1988, the frigate was badly damaged by an Iranian mine, and 10 sailors were wounded. U.S. forces responded with Operation Praying Mantis on 18 April, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s largest engagement of surface warships since World War II. Two Iranian oil platforms were destroyed, and five Iranian warships and gunboats were sunk. An American helicopter also crashed.

====Iran Air Flight 655====
In the course of escorts by the U.S. Navy, the cruiser shot down Iran Air Flight 655 on 3 July 1988, killing all 290 passengers and crew on board. The American government claimed that &quot;Vincennes&quot; was in international waters at the time (which was later proven to be untrue), that the Airbus A300 had been mistaken for an Iranian F-14 Tomcat, and that &quot;Vincennes&quot; feared that she was under attack. The Iranians maintain that &quot;Vincennes&quot; was in their own waters, and that the passenger jet was turning away and increasing altitude after take-off. U.S. Admiral William J. Crowe later admitted on &quot;Nightline&quot; that &quot;Vincennes&quot; was in Iranian territorial waters when it launched the missiles. At the time of the attack, Admiral Crowe claimed that the Iranian plane did not identify itself and sent no response to warning signals he had sent. In 1996, the United States expressed their regret for the event and the civilian deaths it caused.

==Iraq&#x27;s use of chemical weapons==

In a declassified 1991 report, the CIA estimated that Iran had suffered more than 50,000 casualties from Iraq&#x27;s use of several chemical weapons, though current estimates are more than 100,000 as the long-term effects continue to cause casualties. The official CIA estimate did not include the civilian population contaminated in bordering towns or the children and relatives of veterans, many of whom have developed blood, lung and skin complications, according to the Organization for Veterans of Iran. According to a 2002 article in the &quot;Star-Ledger&quot;, 20,000 Iranian soldiers were killed on the spot by nerve gas. As of 2002, 5,000 of the 80,000 survivors continue to seek regular medical treatment, while 1,000 are hospital inpatients.

According to Iraqi documents, assistance in developing chemical weapons was obtained from firms in many countries, including the United States, West Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and France. A report stated that Dutch, Australian, Italian, French and both West and East German companies were involved in the export of raw materials to Iraqi chemical weapons factories. Declassified CIA documents show that the United States was providing reconnaissance intelligence to Iraq around 1987‚Äì88 which was then used to launch chemical weapon attacks on Iranian troops and that the CIA fully knew that chemical weapons would be deployed and sarin and cyclosarin attacks followed.

On 21 March 1986, the United Nations Security Council made a declaration stating that &quot;members are profoundly concerned by the unanimous conclusion of the specialists that chemical weapons on many occasions have been used by Iraqi forces against Iranian troops, and the members of the Council strongly condemn this continued use of chemical weapons in clear violation of the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which prohibits the use in war of chemical weapons.&quot; The United States was the only member who voted against the issuance of this statement. A mission to the region in 1988 found evidence of the use of chemical weapons, and was condemned in Security Council Resolution 612.

According to W. Patrick Lang, senior defense intelligence officer at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, &quot;the use of gas on the battlefield by the Iraqis was not a matter of deep strategic concern&quot; to Reagan and his aides, because they &quot;were desperate to make sure that Iraq did not lose&quot;. He claimed that the Defense Intelligence Agency &quot;would have never accepted the use of chemical weapons against civilians, but the use against military objectives was seen as inevitable in the Iraqi struggle for survival&quot;. The Reagan administration did not stop aiding Iraq after receiving reports of the use of poison gas on Kurdish civilians.

The United States accused Iran of using chemical weapons as well, though the allegations have been disputed. Joost Hiltermann, the principal researcher for Human Rights Watch between 1992 and 1994, conducted a two-year study that included a field investigation in Iraq, and obtained Iraqi government documents in the process. According to Hiltermann, the literature on the Iran‚ÄìIraq War reflects allegations of chemical weapons used by Iran, but they are &quot;marred by a lack of specificity as to time and place, and the failure to provide any sort of evidence&quot;.

Analysts Gary Sick and Lawrence Potter have called the allegations against Iran &quot;mere assertions&quot; and stated, &quot;No persuasive evidence of the claim that Iran was the primary culprit [of using chemical weapons] was ever presented.&quot; Policy consultant and author Joseph Tragert stated, &quot;Iran did not retaliate with chemical weapons, probably because it did not possess any at the time&quot;. Documents uncovered after the 2003 invasion of Iraq show that Iraqi military intelligence was not aware of any large-scale chemical attacks by Iranian forces, although a March 1987 document describes five small-scale chemical attacks perpetrated by the Iranians (four involving mustard gas and one involving phosgene, with the likely source being captured Iraqi munitions), and there are also reports of Iranian use of tear gas and white phosphorus.

At his trial in December 2006, Saddam said he would take responsibility &quot;with honour&quot; for any attacks on Iran using conventional or chemical weapons during the war, but that he took issue with the charges that he ordered attacks on Iraqis. A medical analysis of the effects of Iraqi mustard gas is described in a U.S. military textbook and contrasted effects of World War I gas.

At the time of the conflict, the United Nations Security Council issued statements that &quot;chemical weapons had been used in the war&quot;. UN statements never clarified that only Iraq was using chemical weapons, and according to retrospective authors &quot;the international community remained silent as Iraq used weapons of mass destruction against Iranian[s] as well as Iraqi Kurds.&quot; A 1987 UN report conducted at the behest of both belligerents discovered weapon fragments that established Iraqi responsibility for chemical attacks on Iranian soldiers and civilians, but could not substantiate Iraq&#x27;s allegations of Iranian chemical weapons use: &quot;Iraqi forces have been affected by mustard gas and a pulmonary element, possibly phosgene. In the absence of conclusive evidence of the weapons used, it could not be determined how the injuries were caused.&quot;

Evidence suggests that these Iraqi chemical casualties were likely the result of &quot;blowback&quot;, whereas the evidence that Iraq submitted to the UN‚Äîsuch as two Iranian 130¬†mm shells that UN specialists found had &quot;no internal chemical-resistant coating&quot; and were &quot;normally used for filling with high explosives&quot;‚Äîdid not withstand scrutiny; UN official Iqbal Riza later acknowledged that Iraq&#x27;s evidence was &quot;clearly fabricated&quot;. However, the report&#x27;s phrasing‚Äî&quot;chemical weapons were again used against Iranian forces by Iraqi forces¬†... now also Iraqi forces have sustained injuries from chemical warfare&quot;‚Äîcontributed to an erroneous perception that Iran and Iraq were equally at fault.

In response to further Iraqi chemical attacks on Kurdish civilians after the August 1988 ceasefire with Iran, United States senators Claiborne Pell and Jesse Helms called for comprehensive economic sanctions against Iraq, including an oil embargo and severe limitations on the export of dual-use technology. Although the ensuing legislation passed in the U.S. Senate, it faced strong opposition within the House of Representatives and did not become law. In a rare rebuke, Secretary of State George Shultz condemned Iraq&#x27;s &quot;unjustified and abhorrent&quot; chemical attacks, which Shultz&#x27;s assistant Charles E. Redman characterized as &quot;unacceptable to the civilized world&quot;. Even after these pronouncements, however, the State Department advised against sanctions.

== Comparison to other conflicts==

Bruce Riedel describes the Iran‚ÄìIraq War as &quot;one of the largest and longest conventional interstate wars&quot; of the twentieth century and &quot;the only war in modern times in which chemical weapons were used on a massive scale&quot;. Kanan Makiya writes that &quot;there has not been anything like it in the long history of Iraqi‚ÄìIranian relations, just like there had been nothing like World War I in the history of Europe.&quot;

Iran&#x27;s attack on the &quot;Osirak&quot; nuclear reactor in September 1980 was the first attack on a nuclear reactor and one of only a small handful of military attacks on nuclear facilities in history. It was also the first instance of a pre-emptive attack on a nuclear reactor to forestall the development of a nuclear weapon, though it did not achieve its objective, as France repaired the reactor after the attack. (It took a second pre-emptive strike by the Israeli Air Force in June 1981 to disable the reactor, killing a French engineer in the process and causing France to pull out of &quot;Osirak&quot;. The decommissioning of &quot;Osirak&quot; has been cited as causing a substantial delay to Iraqi acquisition of nuclear weapons.)

The Iran‚ÄìIraq War was the first conflict in the history of warfare in which both forces used ballistic missiles against each other. This war also saw the only confirmed air-to-air helicopter battles in history with the Iraqi Mi-25s flying against Iranian AH-1J SeaCobras (supplied by the United States before the Iranian revolution) on several separate occasions. In November 1980, not long after Iraq&#x27;s initial invasion of Iran, two Iranian SeaCobras engaged two Mi-25s with TOW wire-guided antitank missiles. One Mi-25 went down immediately, the other was badly damaged and crashed before reaching base.

The Iranians repeated this accomplishment on 24 April 1981, destroying two Mi-25s without incurring losses to themselves. One Mi-25 was also downed by an Iranian F-14A Tomcat. The Iraqis hit back, claiming the destruction of a SeaCobra on 14 September 1983 (with YaKB machine gun), then three SeaCobras on 5 February 1984 and three more on 25 February 1984 (two with Falanga missiles, one with S-5 rockets). After a lull in helicopter losses, each side lost a gunship on 13 February 1986. Later, a Mi-25 claimed a SeaCobra shot down with YaKB gun on 16 February, and a SeaCobra claimed a Mi-25 shot down with rockets on 18 February.

The last engagement between the two types was on 22 May 1986, when Mi-25s shot down a SeaCobra. The final claim tally was 10 SeaCobras and 6 Mi-25s destroyed. The relatively small numbers and the inevitable disputes over actual kill numbers makes it unclear if one gunship had a real technical superiority over the other. Iraqi Mi-25s also claimed 43 kills against other Iranian helicopters, such as Agusta-Bell UH-1 Hueys. Both sides, especially Iraq, also carried out air and missile attacks against population centres.

In October 1986, Iraqi aircraft began to attack civilian passenger trains and aircraft on Iranian soil, including an Iran Air Boeing 737 unloading passengers at Shiraz International Airport. In retaliation for the Iranian Operation Karbala 5, Iraq attacked 65 cities in 226 sorties over 42 days, bombing civilian neighbourhoods. Eight Iranian cities came under attack from Iraqi missiles. The bombings killed 65 children in an elementary school in Borujerd. The Iranians responded with Scud missile attacks on Baghdad and struck a primary school there. These events became known as the &quot;war of the cities&quot;.

The war of the cities resumed and peaked in 1988, when Iraq dropped 40 tons of high explosives on Tehran using modified Scud missiles (dubbed &quot;al-Husayn&quot; missiles) over seven weeks, causing panic among civilians and prompting almost 1 million residents of Tehran to temporarily flee their homes. Nevertheless, scholars have noted that this still &quot;ranks as one of the smallest strategic bombing campaigns in history&quot;, paling in comparison to strategic bombing during World War II, which saw 1.2 million tons of bombs dropped on German cities in 1944 alone, or more recent events such as the so-called &quot;Christmas bombings&quot; of North Vietnam, which saw 20,000 tons of bombs dropped on Hanoi and Haiphong in a mere eleven days. In total, 10,000‚Äì11,000 civilians died as a result of the aerial bombardment of Iranian cities with the majority of those deaths occurring in the final year of the war.

Despite the war, Iran and Iraq maintained diplomatic relations and embassies in each other&#x27;s countries until mid-1987.

Iran&#x27;s government used human waves to attack enemy troops and even in some cases to clear minefields. Children volunteered as well. Some reports mistakenly have the Basijis marching into battle while marking their expected entry to heaven by wearing &quot;Plastic Keys to Paradise&quot; around their necks, although other analysts regard this story as a hoax involving a misinterpretation of the carrying of a prayer book called &quot;The Keys to Paradise&quot;(Mafatih al-Janan) by Sheikh Abbas Qumi given to all volunteers.

According to journalist Robin Wright:

During the Fateh offensive in February 1987, I toured the southwest front on the Iranian side and saw scores of boys, aged anywhere from nine to sixteen, who said with staggering and seemingly genuine enthusiasm that they had volunteered to become martyrs. Regular army troops, the paramilitary Revolutionary Guards and mullahs all lauded these youths, known as baseeji [Basij], for having played the most dangerous role in breaking through Iraqi lines. They had led the way, running over fields of mines to clear the ground for the Iranian ground assault. Wearing white headbands to signify the embracing of death, and shouting &quot;Shaheed, shaheed&quot; (Martyr, martyr) they literally blew their way into heaven. Their numbers were never disclosed. But a walk through the residential suburbs of Iranian cities provided a clue. Window after window, block after block, displayed black-bordered photographs of teenage or preteen youths.

== Iran and Iraq&#x27;s modern relationship ==

The relationship between Iraq and Iran has warmed immensely since the downfall of Saddam Hussein, out of mostly pragmatic interests, as they share a common enemy in the Islamic State. Significant military assistance has been provided by Iran to Iraq, resulting in Iran holding a large amount of political influence in Iraq&#x27;s newly elected Shia government. Iraq is also heavily dependent on the relatively more stable and developed Iran for its energy needs, so a stable Iraq is an interest for Iran, foreign policy wise.

The Iran‚ÄìIraq War is regarded as being a major trigger for rising sectarianism in the region, as it was viewed by many as a clash between Sunni Muslims (Ba&#x27;athist Iraq and other Arab States) and the Shia revolutionaries that had recently taken power in Iran. There remains lingering animosity however despite the pragmatic alliance that has been formed as multiple government declarations from Iran have stated that the war will &quot;affect every issue of internal and foreign policy&quot; for decades to come.

The sustained importance of this conflict is attributed mostly to the massive human and economic cost resulting from it, along with its ties to the Iranian Revolution. Another significant effect that the war has on Iran&#x27;s policy is the issue of remaining war reparations. The UN estimates that Iraq owes about $149¬†billion, while Iran contends that, with both the direct and indirect effects taken into account, the cost of the war reaches a trillion.

Iran has not vocalized the desire for these reparations in recent years, and has even suggested forms of financial aid. This is due most likely to Iran&#x27;s interest in keeping Iraq politically stable, and imposing these reparation costs would further burden the already impoverished nation. The most important factor that governs Iraq&#x27;s current foreign policy is the national government&#x27;s consistent fragility following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Iraq&#x27;s need for any and all allies that can help bring stability and bring development has allowed Iran to exert significant influence over the new Iraqi state despite lingering memories of the war.

Currently, Iraq is between two opposing interests, one with Iran, who can provide a reliable source of power as well as military support to the influential Shia militias and political factions, and the other with the United States, who can offer Iraq significant economic aid packages, along with military support in the form of air and artillery strikes. If Iraq is seen to be pulled too far into one side&#x27;s orbit, then the benefits offered to them by the other side will likely be gradually reduced or cut off completely. Another significant factor influencing relations is the shared cultural interests of Iraq and Iran&#x27;s citizens to freely visit the multitude of holy sites located in each country.

==Legacy and memory==
The war is known in Iran as the (&quot;Sacred Defence&quot;) and the &quot;&quot; (&quot;the Imposed War&quot;). The war is known in the Arab world and a few other regions as the &quot;First Gulf War&quot; (). That name, or simply the &#x27;Gulf War&#x27;, was used by Western sources also, until it was used to refer to the conflict between the American-led coalition and Iraq in 1991. The Iran‚ÄìIraq War was rarely referred to as the &quot;Persian Gulf War&quot; until the 1990‚Äì1991 Persian Gulf War, after which the previous war was dubbed the &quot;First Persian Gulf War&quot;.

Besides the Iran‚ÄìIraq war, the 1990 Iraq‚ÄìKuwait conflict, as well as The Iraq War from 2003 to 2011 have all been called the &quot;Second Persian Gulf War&quot;. State media in Iraq dubbed the war &quot;Saddam&#x27;s Qadisiyyah&quot; (, &quot;&quot;), in reference to the seventh-century Battle of al-QƒÅdisiyyah, in which Arab warriors overcame the Sasanian Empire during the Muslim conquest of Iran.

&quot;We are armed with Allahu Akbar&quot;, the 1979 Iranian Islamic revolutionary military march song performed by IRGC troops in front of Ayatollah Khomeini in Jamaran Husinie, made a cultural impact during the war.

<text>Incremental reading is a software-assisted method for learning and retaining information from reading, which involves the creation of flashcards out of electronic articles. &quot;Incremental reading&quot; means &quot;reading in portions&quot;. Instead of a linear reading of articles one at a time, the method works by keeping a large list of electronic articles or books (often dozens or hundreds) and reading parts of several articles in each session. The user prioritizes articles in the reading list. During reading, key points of articles are broken up into flashcards, which are then learned and reviewed over an extended period with the help of a spaced repetition algorithm.

This use of flashcards at later stages of the process is based on the spacing effect (the phenomenon whereby learning is greater when studying is spread out over time) and the testing effect (the finding that long-term memory is increased when some of the learning periods are devoted to retrieving the to-be-remembered information through testing). It targets people trying to learn for life a large amount of information, particularly if it comes from various sources.

==History==
The method itself is often credited to the Polish software developer Piotr Wo≈∫niak. He implemented the first version of incremental reading in 1999 in SuperMemo 99, providing the essential tools of the method: a prioritized reading list and the possibility to extract portions of articles and to create cloze deletions. The term &quot;incremental reading&quot; itself appeared the following year with SuperMemo 10 (2000). Later SuperMemo programmes subsequently enhanced the tools and techniques involved, such as webpage imports, material overload handling, etc.

Limited incremental reading support for the text editor Emacs appeared in 2007.

An Anki add-on for incremental reading was later published in 2011; for Anki 2.0 and 2.1, another add-on is available.

Incremental reading was the first of a series of related concepts invented by Piotr Wo≈∫niak: incremental image learning, incremental video, incremental audio, incremental mail processing, incremental problem solving, and incremental writing. &quot;Incremental learning&quot; is the term Wozniak uses to refer to those concepts.

==Method==
When reading an electronic article, the user extracts the most important parts (similar to underlining or highlighting a paper article) and gradually distills them into flashcards. Flashcards are information presented in a question-answer format (making active recall possible). Cloze deletions are often used in incremental reading, as they are easy to create from the text. Both extracts and flashcards are scheduled independently from the original article.

With time and reviews, articles are supposed to be gradually converted into extracts and extracts into flashcards. Hence, incremental reading is a method of breaking down information from electronic articles into sets of flashcards.

Contrary to extracts, flashcards are reviewed with active recall. This means that extracts such as &quot;George Washington was the first U.S. president&quot; must ultimately be converted into questions like &quot;Who was the first U.S. president?&quot; (answer: George Washington), or cloze deletions like &quot;[...] was the first U.S. president.&quot;

This flashcard creation process is semi-automated ‚Äì the reader chooses which material to learn and edits the precise wording of the questions. In contrast, the software assists in prioritizing articles and making the flashcards and does the scheduling: it calculates the time for the reader to review each chunk according to the rules of a spaced repetition algorithm. This means that all processed pieces of information are presented at increasing intervals.

Individual articles are read in portions proportional to the attention span, which depends on the user, their mood, the article, etc. This allows for a substantial gain in attention, according to Piotr Wozniak.

Without spaced repetition, the reader would quickly get lost in the glut of information when studying dozens of subjects in parallel. However, spaced repetition makes it possible to retain traces of the processed material in memory.
