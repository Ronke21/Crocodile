<text>The Fox News Channel (FNC), commonly known as Fox News, is an American multinational conservative news and political commentary television channel and website based in New York City, U.S. It is owned by Fox News Media, which itself is owned by the Fox Corporation. It is the most-watched cable news network in the U.S., and as of 2023 it generates approximately 70% of its parent company&#x27;s pre-tax profit. The channel broadcasts primarily from studios at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan. Fox News provides a service to 86 countries and territories, with international broadcasts featuring Fox Extra segments during advertising breaks.

The channel was created by Australian-born American media mogul Rupert Murdoch in 1996 to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former Republican media consultant and CNBC executive Roger Ailes as its founding CEO. It launched on October 7, 1996, to 17-million cable subscribers. Fox News grew during the late 1990s and 2000s to become the dominant United States cable news subscription network. By September 2018, 87-million U.S. households (91 percent of television subscribers) could receive Fox News. In 2019, it was the top-rated cable network, averaging 2.5-million viewers in prime time. Murdoch, the executive chairman since 2016, said in 2023 that he would step down and hand responsibilities to his son, Lachlan. Suzanne Scott has been the CEO since 2018.

It has been identified as engaging in biased and false reporting in favor of the Republican Party, its politicians, and conservative causes, while portraying the Democratic Party in a negative light. Researchers have argued that the channel is damaging to the integrity of news overall, and acts as an expanded part of the Republican Party.

The channel has knowingly endorsed false conspiracy theories to promote Republican and conservative causes. After Dominion Voting Systems initiated a defamation lawsuit against Fox regarding their reporting on the 2020 presidential election, Fox&#x27;s internal communications were released. The communications showed that its presenters and senior executives privately doubted claims of a stolen election, while Fox continued to broadcast such claims. Other communications showed Fox CEO Suzanne Scott stating that fact-checking such claims would alienate Fox viewers. Fox settled the lawsuit in 2023 by agreeing to pay Dominion $787.5 million and acknowledging the court ruling that Fox had broadcast false statements about Dominion.

According to research done by Pew Research Center in 2019, 65 percent of Republicans and people who lean Republican trusted Fox News.

==History==

In May 1985, Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch announced that he and American industrialist and philanthropist Marvin Davis intended to develop &quot;a network of independent stations as a fourth marketing force&quot; to directly compete with CBS, NBC, and ABC through the purchase of six television stations owned by Metromedia. In July 1985, 20th Century Fox announced Murdoch had completed his purchase of 50% of Fox Filmed Entertainment, the parent company of 20th Century Fox Film Corporation.

Subsequently, and prior to founding FNC, Murdoch had gained experience in the 24-hour news business when News Corporation&#x27;s BSkyB subsidiary began Europe&#x27;s first 24-hour news channel (Sky News) in the United Kingdom in 1989. With the success of his efforts establishing Fox as a TV network in the United States, experience gained from Sky News and the turnaround of 20th Century Fox, Murdoch announced on January 30, 1996, that News Corp. would launch a 24-hour news channel on cable and satellite systems in the United States as part of a News Corp. &quot;worldwide platform&quot; for Fox programming: &quot;The appetite for news – particularly news that explains to people how it affects them – is expanding enormously&quot;.

In February 1996, after former U.S. Republican Party political strategist and NBC executive Roger Ailes left cable television channel America&#x27;s Talking (now MSNBC), Murdoch asked him to start Fox News Channel. Ailes demanded five months of 14-hour workdays and several weeks of rehearsal shows before its launch on October 7, 1996.

At its debut 17-million households were able to watch FNC; however, it was absent from the largest U.S. media markets of New York City and Los Angeles. Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single-topic shows such as &quot;Fox on Crime&quot; or &quot;Fox on Politics&quot;, surrounded by news headlines. Interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest. The flagship newscast at the time was &quot;The Schneider Report&quot;, with Mike Schneider&#x27;s fast-paced delivery of the news. During the evening, Fox featured opinion shows: &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Report&quot; (later &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;), &quot;The Crier Report&quot; (hosted by Catherine Crier) and &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;. From the beginning, FNC has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation. Graphics were designed to be colorful and gain attention; this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said, even if they could not hear the host (with on-screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker, and &quot;bullet points&quot; when a host was delivering commentary). Fox News also created the &quot;Fox News Alert&quot;, which interrupted its regular programming when a breaking news story occurred.
To accelerate its adoption by cable providers, Fox News paid systems up to $11 per subscriber to distribute the channel. This contrasted with the normal practice, in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for programming. When Time Warner bought Ted Turner&#x27;s Turner Broadcasting System, a federal antitrust consent decree required Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel in addition to its own CNN on its cable systems. Time Warner selected MSNBC as the secondary news channel, not Fox News. Fox News claimed this violated an agreement (to carry Fox News). Citing its agreement to keep its U.S. headquarters and a large studio in New York City, News Corporation enlisted the help of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani&#x27;s administration to pressure Time Warner Cable (one of the city&#x27;s two cable providers) to transmit Fox News on a city-owned channel. City officials threatened to take action affecting Time Warner&#x27;s cable franchises in the city.

During the September 11, 2001 attacks, Fox News was the first news organization to run a news ticker on the bottom of the screen to keep up with the flow of information that day. The ticker has remained, and has proven popular with viewers. In January 2002, Fox News surpassed CNN in ratings for the first time.

In 2023, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that Murdoch had &quot;ditched a plan&quot; to remerge News Corporation with Fox because it &quot;faced resistance from News Corp investors unhappy at the prospect of being lumped together with Fox News, which they consider a toxic brand.&quot; Later that year, Murdoch said he would step down and that his son Lachlan would take over both Fox Corporation and News Corp.

==Political alignment==

Fox News has been identified as practicing biased and false reporting in favor of the Republican Party, its politicians, and conservative causes, while portraying the Democratic Party in a negative light. Fox News has been characterized by critics, commentators, and researchers as a propaganda organization and damaging to the integrity of news overall. Fox News has denied bias in its news reporting and the channel&#x27;s official position is that its news reporting operates independently of its opinion journalism. The channel has knowingly endorsed false conspiracy theories to promote Republican and conservative causes.

Media analyst Brian Stelter, who has written extensively about the network, observed in 2021 that in more recent years it had adjusted its programming to present &quot;less news on the air and more opinions-about-the-news&quot; throughout the day, on concerns it was losing viewers to more conservative competitors that were presenting such content.

==Outlets==
FNC maintains an archive of most of its programs. This archive also includes Movietone News series of newsreels from its now Disney-owned namesake movie studio, 20th Century Fox. Licensing for the Fox News archive is handled by ITN Source, the archiving division of ITN.

===Television===

FNC presents a variety of programming, with up to 15 hours of live broadcasting per day in addition to programming and content for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Most programs are broadcast from Fox News headquarters in New York City (at 1211 Avenue of the Americas), in its streetside studio on Sixth Avenue in the west wing of Rockefeller Center, sharing its headquarters with sister channel Fox Business Network. Fox News Channel has eight studios at its New York City headquarters that are used for its and Fox Business&#x27; programming: Studio B (used for Fox Business programming), Studio D (which has an area for studio audiences; no longer in current use), Studio E (used for &quot;Gutfeld!&quot; and &quot;The Journal Editorial Report&quot;), Studio F (used for &quot;The Story with Martha MacCallum&quot;, &quot;The Five&quot;, Fox Democracy 2020, &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;, &quot;Outnumbered&quot;, &quot;The Faulkner Focus&quot;, and &quot;Fox News Primetime&quot;), Studio G (which houses Fox Business shows, &quot;The Fox Report&quot;, &quot;Your World with Neil Cavuto&quot;, and &quot;Cavuto Live&quot;), Studio H (Fox News Deck used for breaking news coverage, no longer in current use), Studio J (used for &quot;America&#x27;s Newsroom&quot;, &quot;Hannity&quot;, &quot;Fox News Live&quot;, &quot;Fox &amp; Friends First&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Morning Futures&quot;) Starting in , &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; had its pregame show, &quot;Fox NFL Thursday&quot;, originating from Studio F. Another Fox Sports program, &quot;First Things First&quot;, also broadcasts from Studio E.

Other such programs (such as &quot;Special Report with Bret Baier&quot;, &quot;The Ingraham Angle&quot;, &quot;Fox News @ Night&quot;, &quot;Media Buzz&quot;, and editions of &quot;Fox News Live&quot; not broadcast from the New York City studios) are broadcast from Fox News&#x27;s Washington, D.C. studios, located on Capitol Hill across from Washington Union Station in a secured building shared by a number of other television networks, which includes NBC News and C-SPAN. &quot;The Next Revolution&quot; is broadcast from Fox News&#x27; Los Angeles bureau studio, which is also used for news updates coming from Los Angeles. &quot;Life, Liberty &amp; Levin&quot; is done from Levin&#x27;s personal studio in Virginia. Audio simulcasts of the channel are aired on SiriusXM Satellite Radio.

In an October 11, 2009, in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Fox said its hard-news programming runs from &quot;9 AM to 4 PM and 6 to 8 PM on weekdays&quot;. However, it makes no such claims for its other broadcasts, which primarily consist of editorial journalism and commentary.

Fox News Channel began broadcasting in the 720p resolution format on May 1, 2008. This format is available on all major cable and satellite providers.

Fox News Media produces &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;, which airs on Fox Broadcasting and re-airs on FNC. Fox News also produces occasional special event coverage that is broadcast on FBC.

===Radio===

With the growth of the FNC, the company introduced a radio division, Fox News Radio, in 2003. Syndicated throughout the United States, the division provides short newscasts and talk radio programs featuring personalities from the television and radio divisions. In 2006, the company also introduced Fox News Talk, a satellite radio station featuring programs syndicated by (and featuring) Fox News personalities.

===Online===
Introduced in December 1995, the Fox News website features news articles and videos about national and international news. Content on the website is divided into politics, media, U.S., and business. Fox News&#x27; articles are based on the network&#x27;s broadcasts, reports from Fox affiliates and articles produced by other news agencies, such as the Associated Press. Articles are usually accompanied by a video related to the article. Fox News Latino is the version aimed at a Hispanic audience, although presented almost entirely in English, with a Spanish section.

According to NewsGuard, &quot;Much of FoxNews.com&#x27;s content, particularly articles produced by beat reporters and broadcasts produced by network correspondents, is accurate and well-sourced ... However, FoxNews.com has regularly advanced false and misleading claims on topics including the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, the Russo-Ukrainian War, COVID-19, and U.S. elections&quot;.

In September 2008, FNC joined other channels in introducing a live streaming segment to its website: &quot;The Strategy Room&quot;, designed to appeal to older viewers. It airs weekdays from 9 AM to 5 PM and takes the form of an informal discussion, with running commentary on the news. Regular discussion programs include &quot;Business Hour&quot;, &quot;News With a View&quot; and &quot;God Talk&quot;. In March 2009, &quot;The Fox Nation&quot; was launched as a website intended to encourage readers to post articles commenting on the news. Fox News Mobile is the portion of the FNC website dedicated to streaming news clips formatted for video-enabled mobile phones.

=== Fox Nation ===

In 2018, FNC announced that it would launch a subscription video on demand service known as Fox Nation. It serves as a companion service to FNC, carrying original and acquired talk, documentary, and reality programming designed to appeal to Fox News viewers. Some of its original programs feature Fox News personalities and contributors.&quot;&quot;

==Ratings and reception==
In 2003, Fox News saw a large ratings jump during the early stages of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. At the height of the conflict, according to some reports, Fox News had as much as a 300% increase in viewership (averaging 3.3 million viewers daily). In 2004, Fox News&#x27; ratings for its broadcast of the Republican National Convention exceeded those of the three major broadcast networks. During President George W. Bush&#x27;s address, Fox News attracted 7.3 million viewers nationally; NBC, ABC, and CBS had a viewership of 5.9 million, 5.1 million, and 5.0 million respectively.

Between late 2005 and early 2006, Fox News saw a brief decline in ratings. One was in the second quarter of 2006, when it lost viewers for every prime-time program compared with the previous quarter. The audience for &quot;Special Report with Brit Hume&quot;, for example, dropped 19%. Several weeks later, in the wake of the 2006 North Korean missile test and the 2006 Lebanon War, Fox saw a surge in viewership and remained the top-rated cable news channel. Fox produced eight of the top ten most-watched nightly cable news shows, with &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; and &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot; finishing first and second respectively.

FNC ranked No. 8 in viewership among all cable channels in 2006, and No. 7 in 2007. The channel ranked number one during the week of Barack Obama&#x27;s election (November 3–9) in 2008, and reached the top spot again in January 2010 (during the week of the special Senate election in Massachusetts). Comparing Fox to its 24-hour-news-channel competitors, in May 2010, the channel drew an average daily prime-time audience of 1.8 million viewers (versus 747,000 for MSNBC and 595,000 for CNN).

In September 2009, the Pew Research Center published a report on the public view of national news organizations. In the report, 72 percent of polled Republican Fox viewers rated the channel as &quot;favorable&quot;, while 43 percent of polled Democratic viewers and 55 percent of all polled viewers shared that opinion. However, Fox was given the highest &quot;unfavorable&quot; rating of all national outlets studied (25 percent of all polled viewers). The report went on to say that &quot;partisan differences in views of Fox News have increased substantially since 2007&quot;.

A Public Policy Polling poll concluded in 2013 that positive perceptions of FNC had declined from 2010. 41% of polled voters said they trust it, down from 49% in 2010, while 46% said they distrust it, up from 37% in 2010. It was also called the &quot;most trusted&quot; network by 34% of those polled, more than had said the same of any other network.
On the night of October 22, 2012, Fox set a record for its highest-rated telecast, with 11.5 million viewers for the third U.S. presidential debate. In prime time the week before, Fox averaged almost 3.7 million viewers with a total day average of 1.66 million viewers.

In prime time and total day ratings for the week of April 15 to 21, 2013, Fox News, propelled by its coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing, was the highest-ranked network on U.S. cable television, for the first time since August 2005, when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States. January 2014 marked Fox News&#x27;s 145th consecutive month as the highest-rated cable news channel. During that month, Fox News beat CNN and MSNBC combined in overall viewers in both prime time hours and the total day. In the third quarter of 2014, the network was the most-watched cable channel during prime time hours. During the final week of the campaign for the United States elections, 2014, Fox News had the highest ratings of any cable channel, news or otherwise. On election night itself, Fox News&#x27; coverage had higher ratings than that of any of the other five cable or network news sources among viewers between 25 and 54 years of age. The network hosted the first prime-time GOP candidates&#x27; forum of the 2016 campaign on August 6. The debate reached a record-breaking 24 million viewers, by far the largest audience for any cable news event.

A 2017 study by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University found that Fox News was the third most-shared source among supporters of Donald Trump on Twitter during the 2016 presidential election, behind &quot;The Hill&quot; and &quot;Breitbart News&quot;.

In 2018, Fox News was rated by Nielsen as America&#x27;s most watched cable network, averaging a record 2.4 million viewers in prime time and total day during the period of January 1 to December 30, 2018. In an October 2018 Simmons Research survey of the trust in 38 news organizations, Fox News was ranked roughly in the center, with 44.7% of surveyed Americans saying they trusted it.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to increased viewership for all cable news networks. For the first calendar quarter of 2020 (January 1 – March 31), Fox News had their highest-rated quarter in the network&#x27;s history, with Nielsen showing a prime time average total audience of 3.387 million viewers. Sean Hannity&#x27;s program, &quot;Hannity&quot;, weeknights at 9 pm ET was the top-rated show in cable news for the quarter averaging 4.2 million viewers, a figure that not only beat out all of its cable news competition but also placed it ahead of network competition in the same time slot. Fox ended the quarter with the top five shows in prime time, with Fox&#x27;s &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; finishing the quarter in second overall with an average audience of 4.2 million viewers, followed by &quot;The Five&quot;, &quot;The Ingraham Angle&quot;, and &quot;Special Report with Bret Baier&quot;. &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; was the highest non-Fox show on cable, coming in sixth place. Finishing the quarter in 22nd place was &quot;The Lead with Jake Tapper&quot;, CNN&#x27;s highest rated show. According to a Fox News article on the subject, &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; averaged 1.8 million viewers, topping CNN&#x27;s &quot;New Day&quot; and MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot; combined. The same Fox News article said that the Fox Business Network also had its highest-rated quarter in history and that Fox News finished March as the highest-rated network in cable for the 45th consecutive month.

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on August 19, 2020: &quot;Fox News Channel had six of last week&#x27;s 11 highest-rated prime-time programs to finish first in the network ratings race for the third time since June&quot; 2020.

A Morning Consult survey the week after Election Day 2020 showed 30 percent of Republicans in the United States had an unfavorable opinion of Fox News, while 54 percent of Republicans viewed the network favorably, compared to 67 percent before the election. A McClatchy news story suggested criticism from Donald Trump as a major reason, as well as the network&#x27;s early calling of Arizona for Joe Biden, and later joining other networks in declaring Biden the winner of the 2020 election.

Ratings were also down for Fox News. Although it remained ahead of other networks overall, its morning show fell out of first place for the first time since 2001. Trump recommended OANN, which was gaining viewers. Newsmax was also increasing in popularity.

Following a decline in ratings post-2020 U.S. presidential election, in 2021, Fox News regained its lead in cable news ratings ahead of CNN and MSNBC.

===Demographics===
As indicated by a 2013 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, based on Nielsen statistics, Fox appears to have a mostly aged demographic. In March 2024, Fox was the most watched news network in total day and prime time viewers in primetime, with 2.135 million/1.306 million viewers respectively, compared to MSNBC with A25-54 demo, 1.307 million in primetime and 830,000 in day viewers, and CNN with 601,000 in primetime and 462,000 in day viewers. In the Adults age 25-54 category, Fox also leads with 246,000 in primetime and 158,000 in day viewers, followed by MSNBC with 133,000 viewers in primetime and 86,000 viewers in day, and CNN with 124,000 viewers in primetime and 85,000 in day viewers. According to the same Nielsen analysis, MSNBC is the second most watched news network.

In 2008, in the 25–54 age group, Fox News had an average of 557,000 viewers, but dropped to 379,000 in 2013 while increasing its overall audience from 1.89 million in 2010 to 2.02 million in 2013. The median age of a prime-time viewer was 68 . A 2019 Pew Research Center survey showed that among those who named Fox News as their main source for political news, 69% are aged 50 or older.

According to a 2013 Gallup poll, 94% of Fox viewers &quot;either identify as or lean Republican&quot;. The 2019 Pew survey showed that among people who named Fox News as their main source for political and election news, 93% identify as Republicans. Among the top eight political news sources named by at least 2% of American adults, the results show Fox News and MSNBC as the two news channels with the most partisan audiences.

=== Wikipedia consensus on reliability ===
In 2010, the Wikipedia community had its first major discussion on Fox News&#x27; reliability. The community decided that Fox News was politically biased, but generally reliable.

In July 2020, the Wikipedia community announced that Fox News would no longer be considered &quot;generally reliable&quot; in its reporting of science and politics, and that it &quot;should be used with caution to verify contentious claims&quot; for those topics. The decision was made due to Fox News downplaying the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as allegations of Fox News spreading misinformation about climate change and reporting on the false concept of &quot;no-go zones&quot; for non-Muslims in British cities. The decision did not affect Fox News&#x27; reliability on other topics.

In 2022, the Wikipedia community announced that Fox News would now be considered &quot;marginally reliable&quot; in its reporting of science and politics, that Fox News cannot be used as a source for &quot;exceptional claims&quot;, and that its reliability would be decided on an individual case-by-case basis for other scientific and political claims. The decision only applies to news articles on Fox News&#x27; website and does not apply to Fox News articles about topics that are not scientific or political.

Fox News is considered a generally unreliable source for its scientific and political coverage and its talk shows.

==Slogan==
Fox News Channel originally used the slogan &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot;, which was coined by network co-founder Roger Ailes while the network was being established. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the slogan as being a &quot;blunt signal that Fox News planned to counteract what Mr. Ailes and many others viewed as a liberal bias ingrained in television coverage by establishment news networks&quot;. In a 2013 interview with Peter Robinson of the Hoover Institution, Rupert Murdoch defended the company&#x27;s &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot; slogan, saying, &quot;In fact, you&#x27;ll find just as many Democrats as Republicans on and so on&quot;.

In August 2003, Fox News sued comedian Al Franken over his use of the slogan as a subtitle for his book, &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right&quot;, which is critical of Fox News Channel. The lawsuit was dropped three days later, after Judge Denny Chin refused its request for an injunction. In his decision, Chin ruled the case was &quot;wholly without merit, both factually and legally&quot;. He went on to suggest that Fox News&#x27; trademark on the phrase &quot;fair and balanced&quot; could be invalid. In December 2003, FNC won a legal battle concerning the slogan, when AlterNet filed a cancellation petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to have FNC&#x27;s trademark rescinded as inaccurate. AlterNet included Robert Greenwald&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Outfoxed&quot; (2004) as supporting evidence in its case. After losing early motions, AlterNet withdrew its petition; the USPTO dismissed the case. In 2008, FNC used the slogan &quot;We Report, You Decide&quot;, referring to &quot;You Decide 2008&quot; (FNC&#x27;s original slogan for its coverage of election issues).

In August 2016, Fox News Channel began to quietly phase out the &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot; slogan in favor of &quot;Most Watched, Most Trusted&quot;; when these changes were reported in June 2017 by Gabriel Sherman (a writer who had written a biography on Ailes), a network executive said the change &quot;has nothing to do with programming or editorial decisions&quot;. It was speculated by media outlets that Fox News Channel was wishing to distance itself from Ailes&#x27; tenure at the network. In March 2018, the network introduced a new ad campaign, &quot;Real News. Real Honest Opinion.&quot; The ad campaign is intended to promote the network&#x27;s opinion-based programming and counter perceptions surrounding &quot;fake news&quot;.

In mid-November 2020, following the election, Fox News began to use the slogan &quot;Standing Up For What&#x27;s Right&quot; to promote its primetime lineup.

==Content==
===Benghazi attack and aftermath===

Fox News provided extensive coverage of the 2012 Benghazi attack, which host Sean Hannity described in December 2012 as &quot;the story that the mainstream media ignores&quot; and &quot;obviously, a cover-up. And we will get to the bottom of it.&quot; Programming analysis by media watchdog Media Matters, which has declared a &quot;War on Fox News&quot;, found that during the twenty months following the Benghazi attacks, FNC ran 1,098 segments on the issue, including:
* 478 segments involving Susan Rice&#x27;s September 16, 2012, Sunday news show appearances, during which she was falsely accused of lying
* 382 segments on &quot;Special Report&quot;, the network&#x27;s flagship news program
* 281 segments alleging a &quot;cover-up&quot; by the Obama administration
* 144 interviews of GOP members of Congress, but five interviews of Democratic members of Congress and Obama administration officials
* 120 comparisons to Iran-Contra, Watergate, and the actions of the Nixon administration
* 100 segments falsely suggesting the administration issued a &quot;stand-down order&quot; to prevent a rescue operation in Benghazi

Over nearly four years after the Benghazi attack, there were ten official investigations, including six by Republican-controlled House committees. None of the investigations found any evidence of scandal, cover-up or lying by Obama administration officials.

===Uranium One===

From 2015 into 2018, Fox News broadcast extensive coverage of an alleged scandal surrounding the sale of Uranium One to Russian interests, which host Sean Hannity characterized as &quot;one of the biggest scandals in American history&quot;. According to Media Matters, the Fox News coverage extended throughout the programming day, with particular emphasis by Hannity. The network promoted an ultimately unfounded narrative asserting that, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton personally approved the Uranium One sale in exchange for $145 million in bribes paid to the Clinton Foundation. Donald Trump repeated these allegations as a candidate and as president. No evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton had been found after four years of allegations, an FBI investigation, and the 2017 appointment of a Federal attorney to evaluate the investigation. In November 2017, Fox News host Shepard Smith concisely debunked the alleged scandal, infuriating viewers who suggested he should work for CNN or MSNBC. Hannity later called Smith &quot;clueless&quot;, while Smith stated: &quot;I get it, that some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining. I get that. I don&#x27;t work there. I wouldn&#x27;t work there.&quot;

===Pro-Republican and pro-Trump bias===
Fox News has been described as conservative media, and as providing biased reporting in favor of conservative political positions, the Republican Party, and President Donald Trump. Political scientist Jonathan Bernstein described Fox News as an expanded part of the Republican Party. Political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins wrote that Fox News helped &quot;Republicans communicate with their base and spread their ideas, and they have been effective in mobilizing voters to participate in midterm elections (as in 2010 and 2014).&quot; Prior to 2000, Fox News lacked an ideological tilt, and had more Democrats watch the channel than Republicans. During the 2004 United States presidential election, Fox News was markedly more hostile in its coverage of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, and distinguished itself among cable news outlets for heavy coverage of the Swift Boat smear campaign against Kerry. During President Obama&#x27;s first term in office, Fox News helped launch and amplify the Tea Party movement, a conservative movement within the Republican Party that organized protests against Obama and his policies. In the 2004 documentary &quot;Outfoxed&quot;, four people identified as former employees said that Fox News made them &quot;slant the news in favor of conservatives&quot;. Fox News said that the film misrepresented the employment of these employees.

During the Republican primaries, Fox News was perceived as trying to prevent Trump from clinching the nomination. Under Trump&#x27;s presidency, Fox News remade itself into his image, as hardly any criticism of Trump could be heard on Fox News&#x27; prime-time shows. In Fox News&#x27; news reporting, the network dedicated far more coverage to Hillary Clinton-related stories, which critics argued was intended to deflect attention from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Trump provided significant access to Fox News during his presidency, giving 19 interviews to the channel while only 6 in total to other news channels by November 2017; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Trump&#x27;s Fox News interviews as &quot;softball interviews&quot; and some of the interviewers&#x27; interview styles as &quot;fawning&quot;. In July 2018, &quot;The Economist&quot; has described the network&#x27;s coverage of Trump&#x27;s presidency as &quot;reliably fawning&quot;. From 2015 to 2017, the Fox News prime-time lineup changed from being skeptical and questioning of Trump to a &quot;Trump safe space, with a dose of Bannonist populism once considered on the fringe&quot;. The Fox News website has also become more extreme in its rhetoric since Trump&#x27;s election; according to Columbia University&#x27;s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, the Fox News website has &quot;gone a little &quot;Breitbart&quot;&quot; over time. At the start of 2018, Fox News mostly ignored high-profile scandals in the Trump administration which received ample coverage in other national media outlets, such as White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter&#x27;s resignation amid domestic abuse allegations, the downgrading of Jared Kushner&#x27;s security clearance, and the existence of a non-disclosure agreement between Trump and the porn star Stormy Daniels.

In March 2019, Jane Mayer reported in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that Fox News.com reporter Diana Falzone had the story of the Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal before the 2016 election, but that Fox News executive Ken LaCorte told her: &quot;Good reporting, kiddo. But Rupert [Murdoch] wants Donald Trump to win. So just let it go.&quot; The story was killed; LaCorte denied making the statement to Falzone, but conceded: &quot;I was the person who made the call. I didn&#x27;t run it upstairs to Roger Ailes or others. ... I didn&#x27;t do it to protect Donald Trump.&quot; She added that &quot;[Falzone] had put up a story that just wasn&#x27;t anywhere close to being something I was comfortable publishing.&quot; Nik Richie, who claimed to be one of the sources for the story, called LaCorte&#x27;s account &quot;complete bullshit&quot;, adding that &quot;Fox News was culpable. I voted for Trump, and I like Fox, but they did their own &#x27;catch and kill&#x27; on the story to protect him.&quot;

A 2008 study found Fox News gave disproportionate attention to polls suggesting low approval for President Bill Clinton. A 2009 study found Fox News was less likely to pick up stories that reflected well on Democrats, and more likely to pick up stories that reflected well on Republicans. A 2010 study comparing Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Special Report With Brit Hume&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Nightly News&quot; coverage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during 2005 concluded &quot;Fox News was much more sympathetic to the administration than NBC&quot;, suggesting &quot;if scholars continue to find evidence of a partisan or ideological bias at FNC ... they should consider Fox as alternative, rather than mainstream, media&quot;.

Research finds that Fox News increases Republican vote shares and makes Republican politicians more partisan. A 2007 study, using the introduction of Fox News into local markets (1996–2000) as an instrumental variable, found that in the 2000 presidential election &quot;Republicans gained 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points in the towns that broadcast Fox News&quot;, suggesting &quot;Fox News convinced 3 to 28 percent of its viewers to vote Republican, depending on the audience measure&quot;. These results were confirmed by a 2015 study. A 2014 study, using the same instrumental variable, found congressional &quot;representatives become less supportive of President Clinton in districts where Fox News begins broadcasting than similar representatives in similar districts where Fox News was not broadcast.&quot; Another 2014 paper found Fox News viewing increased Republican vote shares among voters who identified as Republican or independent. A 2017 study, using channel positions as an instrumental variable, found &quot;Fox News increases Republican vote shares by 0.3 points among viewers induced into watching 2.5 additional minutes per week by variation in position.&quot; This study used a different methodology for a later period and found an ever bigger effect and impact, leading Matthew Yglesias to write in the &quot;Political Communication&quot; academic journal that they &quot;suggest that conventional wisdom may be greatly underestimating the significance of Fox as a factor in American politics.&quot;

Fox News publicly denies it is biased, with Murdoch and Ailes saying to have included Murdoch&#x27;s statement that Fox has &quot;given room to both sides, whereas only one side had it before&quot;. In June 2009, Fox News host Chris Wallace said: &quot;I think we are the counter-weight [to NBC News] ... they have a liberal agenda, and we tell the other side of the story.&quot; In 2004, Robert Greenwald&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s War on Journalism&quot; argued Fox News had a conservative bias and featured clips from Fox News and internal memos from editorial vice president John Moody directing Fox News staff on how to report certain subjects.

A leaked memo from Fox News vice president Bill Sammon to news staff at the height of the health care reform in the United States debate has been cited as an example of the pro-Republican Party bias of Fox News. His memo asked the staff to &quot;use the term &#x27;government-run health insurance,&#x27; or, when brevity is a concern, &#x27;government option,&#x27; whenever possible&quot;. The memo was sent shortly after Republican pollster Frank Luntz advised Sean Hannity on his Fox show: &quot;If you call it a public option, the American people are split. If you call it the government option, the public is overwhelmingly against it.&quot;

Surveys suggest Fox News is widely perceived to be ideological. A 2009 Pew survey found Fox News is viewed as the most ideological channel in America, with 47 percent of those surveyed said Fox News is &quot;mostly conservative&quot;, 14 percent said &quot;mostly liberal&quot; and 24 percent said &quot;neither&quot;. In comparison, MSNBC had 36 percent identify it as &quot;mostly liberal&quot;, 11 percent as &quot;mostly conservative&quot; and 27 percent as &quot;neither&quot;. CNN had 37 percent describe it as &quot;mostly liberal&quot;, 11 percent as &quot;mostly conservative&quot; and 33 percent as &quot;neither&quot;. A 2004 Pew Research Center survey found FNC was cited (unprompted) by 69 percent of national journalists as a conservative news organization. A Rasmussen poll found 31 percent of Americans felt Fox News had a conservative bias, and 15 percent that it had a liberal bias. It found 36 percent believed Fox News delivers news with neither a conservative or liberal bias, compared with 37 percent who said NPR delivers news with no conservative or liberal bias and 32 percent who said the same of CNN.

David Carr, media critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised the 2012 United States presidential election results coverage on Fox News for the network&#x27;s response to Republican adviser and Fox News contributor Karl Rove challenging its call that Barack Obama would win Ohio and the election. Fox&#x27;s prediction was correct. Carr wrote: &quot;Over many months, Fox lulled its conservative base with agitprop: that President Obama was a clear failure, that a majority of Americans saw [Mitt] Romney as a good alternative in hard times, and that polls showing otherwise were politically motivated and not to be believed. But on Tuesday night, the people in charge of Fox News were confronted with a stark choice after it became clear that Mr. Romney had fallen short: was Fox, first and foremost, a place for advocacy or a place for news? In this moment, at least, Fox chose news.&quot;

A May 2017 study conducted by Harvard University&#x27;s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy examined coverage of Trump&#x27;s first 100 days in office by several major mainstream media outlets including Fox. It found Trump received 80% negative coverage from the overall media, and received the least negative coverage on Fox – 52% negative and 48% positive.

On March 14, 2017, Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News commentator, claimed on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; that British intelligence agency GCHQ had wiretapped Trump on behalf of Barack Obama during the 2016 United States presidential election. On March 16, 2017, White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeated the claim. When Trump was questioned about the claim at a news conference, he said &quot;All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn&#x27;t make an opinion on it.&quot; On March 17, 2017, Shepard Smith, a Fox News anchor, admitted the network had no evidence that Trump was under surveillance. British officials said the White House was backing off the claim. Napolitano was later suspended by Fox News for making the claim.

In June 2018, Fox News executives instructed producers to head off inappropriate remarks made on the shows aired by the network by hosts and commentators. The instructions came after a number of Fox News hosts and guests made incendiary comments about the Trump administration&#x27;s policy of separating migrant children from their parents. Fox News host Laura Ingraham had likened the child detention centers that the children were in to &quot;summer camps&quot;. Guest Corey Lewandowski mocked the story of a 10-year-old child with Down syndrome being separated from her mother; the Fox News host did not address Lewandowski&#x27;s statement. Guest Ann Coulter falsely claimed that the separated children were &quot;child actors&quot;; the Fox News host did not challenge her claim. In a segment on Trump&#x27;s alleged use of racial dog whistles, one Fox News contributor told an African-American whom he was debating: &quot;You&#x27;re out of your cotton-picking mind.&quot;

According to the 2016 book &quot;Asymmetric Politics&quot; by political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins, &quot;Fox News tends to raise the profile of scandals and controversies involving Democrats that receive scant attention in other media, such as the relationship between Barack Obama and William Ayers ... Hillary Clinton&#x27;s role in the fatal 2012 attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya; the gun-running scandal known as &#x27;Fast and Furious&#x27;; the business practices of federal loan guarantee recipient Solyndra; the past activism of Obama White House operative Van Jones; the 2004 attacks on John Kerry by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth; the controversial sermons of Obama&#x27;s Chicago pastor Jeremiah Wright; the filming of undercover videos of supposed wrongdoing by the liberal activist group ACORN; and the &#x27;war on Christmas&#x27; supposedly waged every December by secular, multicultural liberals.&quot;

In October 2018, Fox News ran laudatory coverage of a meeting between Trump-supporting rapper Kanye West and President Trump in the Oval Office. Fox News had previously run negative coverage of rappers and their involvement with Democratic politicians and causes, such as when Fox News ran headlines describing conscious hip-hop artist Common as &quot;vile&quot; and a &quot;cop-killer rapper&quot;, and when Fox News ran negative coverage of Kanye West before he became a Trump supporter.

On November 4, 2018, Trump&#x27;s website, DonaldJTrump.com, announced in a press release that Fox News host Sean Hannity would make a &quot;special guest appearance&quot; with Trump at a midterm campaign rally the following night in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The following morning, Hannity tweeted &quot;To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the President.&quot; Hannity appeared at the president&#x27;s lectern on stage at the rally, immediately mocking the &quot;fake news&quot; at the back of the auditorium, Fox News reporters among them. Several Fox News employees expressed outrage at Hannity&#x27;s actions, with one stating that &quot;a new line was crossed&quot;. Hannity later asserted that his action was not pre-planned, and Fox News stated it &quot;does not condone any talent participating in campaign events&quot;. Fox News host Jeanine Pirro also appeared on stage with Trump at the rally. The Trump press release was later removed from Trump&#x27;s website.

Fox News released a poll of registered voters, jointly conducted by two polling organizations, on June 16, 2019. The poll found some unfavorable results for Trump, including a record high 50% thought the Trump campaign had coordinated with the Russian government, and 50% thought he should be impeached – 43% saying he should also be removed from office – while 48% said they did not favor impeachment. The next morning on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends First&quot;, host Heather Childers twice misrepresented the poll results, stating &quot;a new Fox News poll shows most voters don&#x27;t want impeachment&quot; and &quot;at least half of U.S. voters do not think President Trump should be impeached,&quot; while the on-screen display of the actual poll question was also incorrect. Later that morning on &quot;America&#x27;s Newsroom&quot;, the on-screen display showed the correct poll question and results, but highlighted the 48% of respondents who opposed impeachment rather than the 50% who supported it (the latter being broken-out into two figures). As host Bill Hemmer drew guest Byron York&#x27;s attention to the 48% opposed figure, they did not discuss the 50% support figure, while the on-screen chyron read: &quot;Fox News Poll: 43% Support Trump&#x27;s Impeachment and Removal, 48% Oppose.&quot; Later that day, Trump tweeted: &quot;@FoxNews Polls are always bad for me...Something weird going on at Fox.&quot;

In April 2017, it became known that former Obama administration national security advisor Susan Rice sought the unmasking of Trump associates who were unidentified in intelligence reports, notably Trump&#x27;s incoming national security advisor Michael Flynn, during the presidential transition. In May 2020, acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist, declassified a list of Obama administration officials who had also requested unmasking of Trump associates, which was subsequently publicly released by Republican senators. That month, attorney general Bill Barr appointed federal prosecutor John Bash to examine the unmaskings. Fox News primetime hosts declared the unmaskings a &quot;domestic spying operation&quot; for which the Obama administration was &quot;exposed&quot; in the &quot;biggest abuse of power&quot; in American history. The Bash inquiry closed months later with no findings of substantive wrongdoing.

However, certain Fox personalities have not had as much of a favorable reception from Trump: news anchors Shepard Smith (who retired from Fox in 2019) and Chris Wallace have been criticized by Trump for allegedly being adversarial, alongside Fox analyst Andrew Napolitano, who said Trump&#x27;s actions in the Trump–Ukraine scandal were &quot;both criminal and impeachable behavior&quot;. Trump was also critical of the network hiring former DNC chair Donna Brazile, in 2019. The relationship between Trump and Fox News, as well as other Rupert Murdoch-controlled outlets, soured following the 2020 United States presidential election, as Trump refused to concede that Joe Biden had been elected President-elect. This negative tonal shift led to increased viewership of Newsmax and One America News among Trump and his supporters due to their increased antipathy towards Fox; and as a result, Fox released promotional videos of their opinion hosts disputing the election results, promoting a Trump-affiliated conspiracy theory about voter fraud. By one measure, Newsmax saw a 497% spike in viewership, while Fox News saw a 38% decline.

Writing for the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in February 2021, senior media writer Tom Jones argued that the primary distinction between Fox News and MSNBC is not right bias vs. left bias, but rather that much of the content on Fox News, especially during its primetime programs, &quot;is not based in truth&quot;.

The &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; reported in August 2021 that it had reviewed four months of emails indicating Fox News producers had coordinated with aides of Florida governor Ron DeSantis to promote his political prospects by inviting him for frequent network appearances, exchanging talking points and, in one case, helping him to stage an exclusive news event.

In February 2024, Alan Rosenblatt of Johns Hopkins University said that Fox News &quot;is an entertainment company that has a news division, not a news company&quot;, adding that it &quot;not only does not provide that distinction, it goes out of its way to make it difficult to see the difference. They make their opinion programs look like news programs, and they incorporate enough opinion content on their news programs to further that deception.&quot;

In early 2024, Fox News host Jesse Watters promoted a conspiracy theory involving Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce, and the American Democratic party in hopes of influencing voters ahead of the U.S. presidential primary season.

Fox News has published headlines accusing the English Wikipedia of having a left-wing and socialist bias.

=== Coverage of Russia investigation ===

On October 30, 2017, when special counsel Robert Mueller indicted Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and revealed George Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty (all of whom were involved in the Trump 2016 campaign), this was the focus of most media&#x27;s coverage, except Fox News&#x27;. Hosts and guests on Fox News called for Mueller to be fired. Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson focused their shows on unsubstantiated allegations that Clinton sold uranium to Russia in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation and on the Clinton campaign&#x27;s role in funding the Steele dossier. Hannity asserted: &quot;The very thing they are accusing President Trump of doing, they did it themselves.&quot; During the segment, Hannity mistakenly referred to Clinton as President Clinton. Fox News dedicated extensive coverage to the uranium story, which Democrats said was an attempt to distract from Mueller&#x27;s intensifying investigation. CNN described the coverage as &quot;a tour de force in deflection and dismissal&quot;. On October 31, CNN reported Fox News employees were dissatisfied with their outlet&#x27;s coverage of the Russia investigation, with employees calling it an &quot;embarrassment&quot;, &quot;laughable&quot;, and saying it &quot;does the viewer a huge disservice and further divides the country&quot; and that it is &quot;another blow to journalists at Fox who come in every day wanting to cover the news in a fair and objective way&quot;.

When the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election intensified in October 2017, the focus of Fox News coverage turned &quot;what they see as the scandal and wrongdoing of President Trump&#x27;s political opponents. In reports like these, Bill and Hillary Clinton are prominent and recurring characters because they are considered the real conspirators working with the Russians to undermine American democracy.&quot; Paul Waldman of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the coverage as &quot;No puppet. You&#x27;re the puppet&quot;, saying it was a &quot;careful, coordinated, and comprehensive strategy&quot; to distract from Mueller&#x27;s investigation. German Lopes of &quot;Vox&quot; said Fox News&#x27; coverage has reached &quot;levels of self-parody&quot; as it dedicated coverage to low-key stories, such as a controversial &quot;Newsweek&quot; op-ed and hamburger emojis, while other networks had wall-to-wall coverage of Mueller&#x27;s indictments.

A &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis of Russia-related media coverage in cable news found most mentions of Russia on Fox News were spoken in close proximity to &quot;uranium&quot; and &quot;dossier&quot;. On November 1, 2017, &quot;Vox&quot; analyzed the transcripts of Fox News, CNN and MSNBC, and found Fox News &quot;was unable to talk about the Mueller investigation without bringing up Hillary Clinton&quot;, &quot;talked significantly less about George Papadopoulos—the Trump campaign adviser whose plea deal with Mueller provides the most explicit evidence thus far that the campaign knew of the Russian government&#x27;s efforts to help Trump—than its competitors&quot;, and &quot;repeatedly called Mueller&#x27;s credibility into question&quot;.

In December 2017, Fox News escalated its attacks on the Mueller investigation, with hosts and guest commentators suggesting the investigation amounted to a coup. Guest co-host Kevin Jackson referred to a right-wing conspiracy theory claiming Strzok&#x27;s messages are evidence of a plot by FBI agents to assassinate Trump, a claim which the other Fox co-hosts quickly said is not supported by any credible evidence. Fox News host Jeanine Pirro called the Mueller investigation team a &quot;criminal cabal&quot; and said the team ought to be arrested. Other Fox News figures referred to the investigation as &quot;corrupt&quot;, &quot;crooked&quot;, and &quot;illegitimate&quot;, and likened the FBI to the KGB, the Soviet-era spy organization that routinely tortured and summarily executed people. Political scientists and scholars of coups described the Fox News rhetoric as scary and dangerous. Experts on coups rejected that the Mueller investigation amounted to a coup; rather, the Fox News rhetoric was dangerous to democracy and mirrored the kind of rhetoric that occurs before purges. A number of observers argued the Fox News rhetoric was intended to discredit the Mueller investigation and sway President Donald Trump to fire Mueller.

In August 2018, Fox News was criticized for giving more prominent coverage of a murder committed by an undocumented immigrant than the convictions of Donald Trump&#x27;s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his long-term personal attorney, Michael Cohen. At the same time, most other national mainstream media gave wall-to-wall coverage of the convictions. Fox News hosts Dana Perrino and Jason Chaffetz argued that voters care far more about the murder than the convictions of the President&#x27;s former top aides, and hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity downplayed the convictions.

=== False claims about other media ===

==== CNN&#x27;s Jake Tapper ====
In November 2017, following the 2017 New York City truck attack wherein a terrorist shouted &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot;, Fox News distorted a statement by Jake Tapper to make it appear as if he had said &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; can be used under the most &quot;beautiful circumstances&quot;. Fox News omitted that Tapper had said the use of &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; in the terrorist attack was not one of these beautiful circumstances. A headline on FoxNews.com was preceded by a tag reading &quot;OUTRAGEOUS&quot;. The Fox News Twitter account distorted the statement even more, saying &quot;Jake Tapper Says &#x27;Allahu Akbar&#x27; Is &#x27;Beautiful&#x27; Right After NYC Terror Attack&quot; in a tweet that was later deleted. Tapper chastised Fox News for choosing to &quot;deliberately lie&quot; and said &quot;there was a time when one could tell the difference between Fox and the nutjobs at &quot;Infowars&quot;. It&#x27;s getting tougher and tougher. Lies are lies.&quot; In 2009, Tapper had come to the defense of Fox News while he was a White House correspondent for ABC News, after the Obama administration claimed that the network was not a legitimate news organization.

Fox News guest host Jason Chaffetz apologized to Tapper for misrepresenting his statement. After Fox News had deleted the tweet, Sean Hannity repeated the misrepresentation and called Tapper &quot;liberal fake news CNN&#x27;s fake Jake Tapper&quot; and mocked his ratings.

==== &quot;The New York Times&quot; ====
In July 2017, a report by &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; falsely said &quot;The New York Times&quot; had disclosed intelligence in one of its stories and that this intelligence disclosure helped Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, to evade capture. The report cited an inaccurate assertion by Gen. Tony Thomas, the head of the United States Special Operations Command, that a major newspaper had disclosed the intelligence. Fox News said it was &quot;The New York Times&quot;, repeatedly running the chyron &quot;NYT Foils U.S. Attempt To Take Out Al-Bahgdadi&quot;. Pete Hegseth, one of the show&#x27;s hosts, criticized the &quot;failing &quot;New York Times&quot;&quot;. President Donald Trump tweeted about the &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; report shortly after it first aired, saying &quot;The Failing &quot;New York Times&quot; foiled U.S. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist, Al-Baghdadi. Their sick agenda over National Security.&quot; Fox News later updated the story, but without apologizing to &quot;The New York Times&quot; or responding directly to the inaccuracies.

In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; column, Erik Wemple said Chris Wallace had covered &quot;The New York Times&quot; story himself on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;, adding: &quot;Here&#x27;s another case of the differing standards between Fox News&#x27;s opinion operation&quot;, which has given &quot;a state-run vibe on all matters related to Trump&quot;, compared to Fox News&#x27;s news operation, which has provided &quot;mostly sane coverage&quot;.

===Climate change===

Fox News has often been described as a major platform for climate change denial. According to the fact-checking website Climate Feedback, Fox News is part of &quot;a network of unreliable outlets for climate news.&quot; A 2011 study by Lauren Feldman and Anthony Leiserowitz found Fox News &quot;takes a more dismissive tone toward climate change than CNN and MSNBC&quot;. A 2008 study found Fox News emphasized the scientific uncertainty of climate change more than CNN, was less likely to say climate change was real, and more likely to interview climate change skeptics. Leaked emails showed that in 2009 Bill Sammon, the Fox News Washington managing editor, instructed Fox News journalists to dispute the scientific consensus on climate change and &quot;refrain from asserting that the planet has warmed (or cooled) in any given period without IMMEDIATELY pointing out that such theories are based upon data that critics have called into question.&quot;

According to climate scientist Michael E. Mann, Fox News &quot;has constructed an alternative universe where the laws of physics no longer apply, where the greenhouse effect is a myth, and where climate change is a hoax, the product of a massive conspiracy among scientists, who somehow have gotten the polar bears, glaciers, sea levels, superstorms, and megadroughts to play along.&quot; According to James Lawrence Powell&#x27;s 2011 study of the climate science denial movement, Fox News provides &quot;the deniers with a platform to say whatever they like without fear of contradiction.&quot; Fox News employs Steve Milloy, a prominent climate change denier with close financial and organizational ties to oil companies, as a contributor. In his columns about climate change for &quot;FoxNews.com&quot;, Fox News has failed to disclose his substantial funding from oil companies.

In 2011, the hosts of &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; described climate change as &quot;unproven science&quot;, a &quot;disputed fact&quot;, and criticized the Department of Education for working together with the children&#x27;s network Nickelodeon to teach children about climate change. In 2001, Sean Hannity described the scientific consensus on climate change as &quot;phony science from the left&quot;. In 2004, he falsely alleged that &quot;scientists still can&#x27;t agree on whether the global warming is scientific fact or fiction&quot;. In 2010, Hannity said the so-called &quot;Climategate&quot; – the leaking of e-mails by climate scientist that climate change skeptics claimed demonstrated scientific misconduct but which all subsequent enquiries have found no evidence of misconduct or wrongdoing – a &quot;scandal&quot; that &quot;exposed global warming as a myth cooked up by alarmists&quot;. Hannity frequently invites contrarian fringe scientists and critics of climate change to his shows. In 2019, a widely shared Fox News news report falsely claimed that new climate science research showed that the Earth might be heading to a new Ice Age; the author of the study that Fox News cited said that Fox News &quot;utterly misrepresents our research&quot; and the study did not in any way suggest that Earth was heading to an Ice Age. Fox News later corrected the story.

Shepard Smith drew attention for being one of few voices formerly on Fox News to forcefully state that climate change is real, that human activities are a primary contributor to it and that there is a scientific consensus on the issue. His acceptance of the scientific consensus on climate change drew criticism from Fox News viewers and conservatives. Smith left Fox News in October 2019. In a 2021 interview with Christiane Amanpour on her eponymous show in CNN, he stated that his presence on Fox had become &quot;untenable&quot; due to the &quot;falsehoods&quot; and &quot;lies&quot; intentionally spread on the network&#x27;s opinion shows.

=== Murder of Seth Rich conspiracy ===

On May 16, 2017, a day when other news organizations were extensively covering Donald Trump&#x27;s revelation of classified information to Russia, Fox News ran a lead story about a private investigator&#x27;s uncorroborated claims about the murder of Seth Rich, a DNC staffer. The private investigator said he had uncovered evidence that Rich was in contact with WikiLeaks and law enforcement were covering it up. The killing of Rich has given rise to conspiracy theories in right-wing circles that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party had Seth Rich killed allegedly because he was the source of the DNC leaks. U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russia was the source of the leaks. In reporting the investigator&#x27;s claims, the Fox News report reignited right-wing conspiracy theories about the killing.

The Fox News story fell apart within hours. Other news organizations quickly revealed the investigator was a Donald Trump supporter and had according to NBC News &quot;developed a reputation for making outlandish claims, such as one appearance on Fox News in 2007 in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol-toting lesbian gangs were raping young women.&quot; The family of Seth Rich, the Washington D.C. police department, the Washington D.C. mayor&#x27;s office, the FBI, and law enforcement sources familiar with the case rebuked the investigator&#x27;s claims. Rich&#x27;s relatives said: &quot;We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth&#x27;s murderers.&quot; The spokesperson for the family criticized Fox News for its reporting, alleging the outlet was motivated by a desire to deflect attention from the Trump-Russia story: &quot;I think there&#x27;s a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda.&quot; The family has called for retractions and apologies from Fox News for the inaccurate reporting. Over the course of the day, Fox News altered the contents of the story and the headline, but did not issue corrections. When CNN contacted the private investigator later that day, the investigator said he had no evidence that Rich had contacted WikiLeaks. The investigator claimed he only learned about the possible existence of the evidence from a Fox News reporter. Fox News did not respond to inquiries by CNN, and the Washington Post. Fox News later on May 23, seven days after the story was published, retracted its original report, saying the original report did not meet its standards.

Nicole Hemmer, then assistant professor at the Miller Center of Public Affairs, wrote that the promotion of the conspiracy theory demonstrated how Fox News was &quot;remaking itself in the image of fringe media in the age of Trump, blurring the lines between real and fake news.&quot; Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations said while intent behind Fox News, as a counterweight to the liberal media was laudable, the culmination of those efforts have been to create an alternative news source that promotes hoaxes and myths, of which the promotion of the Seth Rich conspiracy is an example. Fox News was also criticized by conservative outlets, such as &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, and conservative columnists, such as Jennifer Rubin, Michael Gerson, and John Podhoretz.

Rich&#x27;s parents, Joel and Mary Rich, sued Fox News for the emotional distress it had caused them by its false reporting. In 2020, Fox News settled with Rich family, making a payment that was not officially disclosed but which was reported to be in the seven figures. Although the settlement had been agreed to earlier in the year, Fox News arranged to delay the public announcement until after the 2020 presidential election.

=== Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville ===
Fox News hosts and contributors defended Trump&#x27;s remarks that &quot;many sides&quot; were to blame for violence at a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia. Some criticized Trump. In a press conference on August 15, Trump used the term &quot;alt-left&quot; to describe counterprotesters at the white supremacist rally, a term which had been used in Fox News&#x27; coverage of the white supremacist rally. Several of Trump&#x27;s comments at the press conference mirrored those appearing earlier on Fox News.

According to Dylan Byers of CNN, Fox News&#x27; coverage on the day of the press conference &quot;was heavy with &quot;whataboutism&quot;. The average Fox viewer was likely left with the impression that the media&#x27;s criticism of Trump and leftist protestors&#x27; toppling of some Confederate statues were far greater threats to America than white supremacism or the president&#x27;s apparent defense of bigotry.&quot; Byers wrote &quot;it showed that if Fox News has a line when it comes to Trump&#x27;s presidency, it was not crossed on Tuesday.&quot;

=== Glenn Beck&#x27;s comments about George Soros ===
During Glenn Beck&#x27;s tenure at Fox News, he became one of the most high-profile proponents of conspiracy theories about George Soros, a Jewish Hungarian-American businessman and philanthropist known for his donations to American liberal political causes. Beck regularly described Soros as a &quot;puppet-master&quot; and used common anti-Semitic tropes to describe Soros and his activities. In a 2010 three-part series, Beck depicted George Soros as a cartoonish villain trying to &quot;form a shadow government, using humanitarian aid as a cover&quot;, and that Soros wanted a one-world government. Beck promoted the false and anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Soros was a Nazi collaborator as a 14-year-old in Nazi-occupied Hungary. Beck also characterized Soros&#x27;s mother as a &quot;wildly anti-Semitic&quot; Nazi collaborator. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;Beck&#x27;s series was largely considered obscene and delusional, if not outright anti-Semitic&quot;, but Beck&#x27;s conspiracy theory became common on the right-wing of American politics. Amid criticism of Beck&#x27;s false smears, Fox News defended Beck, stating &quot;information regarding Mr. Soros&#x27;s experiences growing up were taken directly from his writings and from interviews given by him to the media, and no negative opinion was offered as to his actions as a child.&quot; Roger Ailes, then-head of Fox News, dismissed criticism levied at Beck by hundreds of rabbis, saying that they were &quot;left-wing rabbis who basically don&#x27;t think that anybody can ever use the word, Holocaust, on the air.&quot;

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
During the first few weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Fox News was considerably more likely than other mainstream news outlets to promote misinformation about COVID-19. The network promoted the narrative that the emergency response to the pandemic was politically motivated or otherwise unwarranted, with Sean Hannity explicitly calling it a &quot;hoax&quot; (he later denied doing so) and other hosts downplaying it. This coverage was consistent with the messaging of Trump at the time. Only in mid March did the network change the tone of its coverage, after President Trump declared a national emergency. At the same time that Fox News commentators downplayed the threat of the virus in public, Fox&#x27;s management and the Murdoch family took a broad range of internal measures to protect themselves and their employees against it.

Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, two of Fox News&#x27;s primetime hosts, promoted use of the drug hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19, an off-label usage which at the time was supported only by anecdotal evidence, after it was touted by Trump as a possible cure. Fox News promoted a conspiracy theory that coronavirus death toll numbers were inflated with people who would have died anyway from preexisting conditions. This was disputed by White House coronavirus task force members Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, with Fauci describing conspiracy theories as &quot;nothing but distractions&quot; during public health crises. Later in the pandemic, Hannity, Ingraham and Carlson promoted the use of livestock dewormer ivermectin as a possible COVID-19 treatment.

Studies have linked trust in Fox News, as well as viewership of Fox News, with fewer preventive behaviors and more risky behaviors related to COVID-19.

Once a COVID-19 vaccine became widely available, Fox News consistently questioned the efficacy and safety of the vaccine, celebrated evidence-free skepticism, and blasted attempts to promote vaccinations. More than 90% of Fox Corporation&#x27;s full-time employees had been fully vaccinated by September 2021.

===2020 election fraud allegations and lawsuits by Dominion and Smartmatic ===

After Trump&#x27;s defeat in the 2020 presidential election, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro promoted baseless allegations on her program that voting machine company Smartmatic and its competitor Dominion Voting Systems had conspired to rig the election against Trump. Hosts Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo also promoted the allegations on their programs on sister network Fox Business. In December 2020, Smartmatic sent a letter to Fox News demanding retractions and threatening legal action, specifying that retractions &quot;must be published on multiple occasions&quot; so as to &quot;match the attention and audience targeted with the original defamatory publications.&quot; Days later, each of the three programs aired the same three-minute video segment consisting of an interview with an election technology expert who refuted the allegations promoted by the hosts, responding to questions from an unseen and unidentified man. None of the three hosts personally issued retractions. Smartmatic filed a $2.7 billion defamation suit against the network, the three hosts, Powell and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in February 2021. In an April 2021 court brief seeking dismissal of the suit, Fox attorney Paul Clement argued that the network was simply &quot;reporting allegations made by a sitting President and his lawyers.&quot; A New York State Supreme Court judge ruled in March 2022 that the suit could proceed, though he dismissed allegations against Sidney Powell and Pirro, and some claims against Giuliani. The judge allowed allegations against Bartiromo and Dobbs to stand. The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division unanimously rejected a Fox News bid to dismiss the Smartmatic suit in February 2023. The court reinstated defamation allegations against Giuliani and Pirro.

In December 2020, Dominion Voting Systems sent a similar letter demanding retractions to Trump attorney Sidney Powell, who had promoted the allegations on Fox programs. On March 26, 2021, Dominion filed a $1.6billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News, alleging that Fox and some of its pundits spread conspiracy theories about Dominion, and allowed guests to make false statements about the company. On May 18, 2021, Fox News filed a motion to dismiss the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit, asserting a First Amendment right &quot;to inform the public about newsworthy allegations of paramount public concern.&quot; The motion to dismiss was denied on December 16, 2021, by a Delaware Superior Court judge. In addition to Bartiromo, Dobbs, and Pirro, the suit also names primetime hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. Venezuelan businessman Majed Khalil sued Fox, Dobbs and Powell for $250 million in December 2021, alleging they had falsely implicated him in rigging Dominion and Smartmatic machines. Dobbs and Fox News reached a confidential settlement with Khalil in April 2023.

Fox News was the only major network or cable news outlet to not carry the first televised prime time hearing of the January 6 committee live; its regular programming of &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; and &quot;Hannity&quot; was aired without commercial breaks. During the weeks following the election, Carlson and Hannity often amplified Trump&#x27;s election falsehoods on their programs; previously disclosed text messages between Hannity and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany were presented during the hearing. Hannity told his audience, &quot;Unlike this committee and their cheerleaders in the media mob, we will actually be telling you the truth,&quot; while Carlson said, &quot;This is the only hour on an American news channel that won&#x27;t be covering their propaganda live. They are lying and we are not going to help them do it.&quot;

In June 2022, a Delaware Superior Court judge again declined to dismiss the Dominion suit against Fox News, and also allowed Dominion to sue the network&#x27;s corporate parent, Fox Corporation. The judge ruled that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch may have acted with actual malice because there was a reasonable inference they &quot;either knew Dominion had not manipulated the election or at least recklessly disregarded the truth when they allegedly caused Fox News to propagate its claims about Dominion.&quot; He noted a report that Rupert Murdoch spoke with Trump a few days after the election and informed him that he had lost.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in December 2022 that Dominion had acquired communications between Fox News executives and hosts, and between a Fox Corporation employee and the Trump White House, showing they knew that what the network was reporting was untrue. Dominion attorneys said hosts Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, and Fox executives, attested to this in sworn depositions. In November 2020, Hannity hosted Sidney Powell, who asserted Dominion machines had been rigged, but said in his deposition, &quot;I did not believe it for one second.&quot; A February 2023 Dominion court filing showed Fox News primetime hosts messaging each other to insult and mock Trump advisers, indicating the hosts knew the allegations made by Powell and Giuliani were false. Rupert Murdoch messaged that Trump&#x27;s voter fraud claims were &quot;really crazy stuff,&quot; telling Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott that it was &quot;terrible stuff damaging everybody, I fear.&quot; As a January 2021 Georgia runoff election approached that would determine party control of the U.S. Senate, Murdoch told Scott, &quot;Trump will concede eventually and we should concentrate on Georgia, helping any way we can.&quot;

After the 2016 election, the network developed a cutting-edge system to call elections, which proved very successful during the 2018 midterm elections. The network was the first to call the 2020 Arizona race for Biden, angering many viewers. Washington managing editor Bill Sammon supervised the network&#x27;s Decision Desk that made the call. Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, the network&#x27;s main news anchors, suggested during a high-level conference call that relying solely on data to make the call was inadequate and that viewer reaction should also be considered; MacCallum said, &quot;in a Trump environment, the game is just very, very different.&quot; Sammon stood by the 2020 call and was fired by the network after the January 2021 Georgia runoff.

In 2023, Rupert Murdoch was deposed and testified that some Fox News commentators were endorsing election fraud claims they knew were false.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matza_2/27/2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters_Robertson_2/27/2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2023, Fox&#x27;s internal communications were released, showing that its presenters and senior executives privately doubted Donald Trump&#x27;s claims of a stolen election. Chairman Rupert Murdoch once described Trump&#x27;s voter fraud claims as &quot;really crazy stuff&quot;, and also said that Trump advisers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell&#x27;s television appearances were &quot;terrible stuff damaging everybody&quot;. One November 2020 exchange showed Tucker Carlson accusing Powell of &quot;lying ... I caught her. It&#x27;s insane&quot;, with Laura Ingraham responding that &quot;Sidney is a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy&quot;. In another exchange that month, Carlson called for Fox journalist Jacqui Heinrich to be &quot;fired&quot; because she fact-checked Trump and said that there was no evidence of voter fraud from Dominion. Carlson said that Heinrich&#x27;s actions &quot;needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It&#x27;s measurably hurting the company. The stock price is down&quot;, while Heinrich deleted the fact-check the next morning.

In March 2023, more of Fox&#x27;s internal communications were released. One November 2020 communication showed Fox CEO Suzanne Scott criticizing fact-checking, stating that she cannot &quot;keep defending these reporters who don&#x27;t understand our viewers and how to handle stories ... The audience feels like we crapped on&quot; them, and Fox was losing their audience&#x27;s &quot;trust and belief&quot; in them. Another December 2020 communication showed Scott responding to Fox presenter Eric Shawn&#x27;s fact-checking of Donald Trump&#x27;s false 2020 election claims by demanding that the fact-checking &quot;has to stop now ... This is bad business ... The audience is furious.&quot;

On March 31, 2023, Delaware Superior Court judge Eric Davis ruled in a summary judgment that it &quot;is CRYSTAL clear that none of the statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true&quot; and ordered for the case to go to trial.

On April 18, 2023, Fox News reached a settlement with Dominion just before the trial started, concluding the lawsuit; Fox agreed to pay Dominion $787.5 million, and further stated: &quot;We acknowledge the Court&#x27;s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false&quot;.

===Compulsory reductions in meat consumption===
In April 2021, at least five Fox News and Fox Business personalities amplified a story published by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, a British tabloid, that incorrectly linked a university study to President Joe Biden&#x27;s climate change agenda, to falsely assert that Americans would be compelled to dramatically reduce their meat consumption to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions caused by flatulence. Fox News aired a graphic detailing the supposed compulsory reductions, falsely indicating the information came from the Agriculture Department, which numerous Republican politicians and commentators tweeted. Fox News anchor John Roberts reported to &quot;say goodbye to your burgers if you want to sign up to the Biden climate agenda.&quot; Days later, Roberts acknowledged on air that the story was false.

=== Report that Biden administration was continuing to build the Mexico–United States border wall ===
According to analysis by Media Matters, on May 12, 2021, Fox News reported on its website: &quot;Biden resumes border wall construction after promising to halt it&quot;. Correspondent Bill Melugin then appeared on &quot;Special Report with Bret Baier&quot; to report &quot;the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is actually going to be restarting border wall construction down in the Rio Grande Valley&quot; after &quot;a lot of blowback and pressure from local residents and local politicians.&quot; After the Corps of Engineers tweeted a clarification, Melugin deleted a tweet about the story and tweeted an &quot;update&quot; clarifying that a levee wall was being constructed to mitigate damage to flood control systems caused by uncompleted wall construction, and the website story headline was changed to &quot;Biden administration to resume border wall levee construction as crisis worsens.&quot; Later on &quot;Fox News Primetime&quot;, host Brian Kilmeade briefly noted the levee but commented to former Trump advisor Stephen Miller: &quot;They&#x27;re going to restart building the wall again, Stephen.&quot; Fox News host Sean Hannity later broadcast the original Melugin story without any mention of the levee.

===Crime reporting===
Media Matters reported in September 2024 that during the Biden presidency Fox News had promoted a false &quot;crime crisis&quot; narrative, particularly directed toward undocumented migrants, which reflected Donald Trump&#x27;s political rhetoric. The Fox News narrative consisted of reported violent crime anecdotes rather than FBI crime rate statistics showing violent crime had declined significantly since 2020. One Fox host, Ainsley Earhardt, said that even if the FBI data were right, &quot;we&#x27;re all a little bit more scared than we used to be.&quot; Later that month, weeks before the 2024 presidential election, the FBI released crime data for 2023 showing that violent crime had declined 3% from 2022. The report was widely covered by mainstream news outlets that day, though the Fox News coverage was limited to a 28-second segment by evening anchor Bret Baier. He reported &quot;critics say the report is not accurate because it does not include big cities,&quot; echoing a false assertion made by Elon Musk and other Trump supporters on social media.

==Controversies==

===Sexual harassment===
The network has been accused of permitting sexual harassment and racial discrimination by on-air hosts, executives, and employees, paying out millions of dollars in legal settlements. Prominent Fox News figures such as Roger Ailes, Bill O&#x27;Reilly and Eric Bolling were fired after many women accused them of sexual harassment. At least four lawsuits alleged Fox News co-president Bill Shine ignored, enabled or concealed Roger Ailes&#x27; alleged sexual harassment. Fox News CEO Rupert Murdoch has dismissed the high-profile sexual misconduct allegations as &quot;largely political&quot; and speculated they were made &quot;because we are conservative&quot;.

Bill O&#x27;Reilly and Fox News settled six agreements, totaling $45 million, with women who accused O&#x27;Reilly of sexual harassment. In January 2017, shortly after Bill O&#x27;Reilly settled a sexual harassment lawsuit for $32 million (&quot;an extraordinarily large amount for such cases&quot;), Fox News renewed Bill O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s contract. Fox News&#x27;s parent company, 21st Century Fox, said it was aware of the lawsuit. The contract between O&#x27;Reilly and Fox News read he could not be fired from the network unless sexual harassment allegations were proven in court.

Fox News&#x27;s extensive coverage of the Harvey Weinstein scandal in October 2017 was seen by some as hypocritical. Fox News dedicated at least 12 hours of coverage to the Weinstein scandal, yet only dedicated 20 minutes to Bill O&#x27;Reilly, who just like Weinstein had been accused of sexual harassment by a multitude of women. A few weeks later, when a number of females under the age of 18, including a 14-year-old, accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of making sexual advances, Hannity dismissed the sexual misconduct allegations and dedicated coverage on his TV show to casting doubt on the accusers. Other prime-time Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham queried &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s reporting or opted to bring up sexual misconduct allegations regarding show business figures such as Harvey Weinstein and Louis C.K. Fox News figures Jeanine Pirro and Gregg Jarrett questioned both the validity of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s reporting and that of the women. In December 2017, a few days before the Alabama Senate election, Fox News, along with the conspiracy websites &quot;Breitbart News&quot; and &quot;The Gateway Pundit&quot;, ran an inaccurate headline which claimed one of Roy Moore&#x27;s accusers admitted to forging an inscription by Roy Moore in her yearbook; Fox News later added a correction to the story.

A number of Fox News hosts have welcomed Bill O&#x27;Reilly to their shows and paid tributes to Roger Ailes after his death. In May 2017, Hannity called Ailes &quot;a second father&quot; and said to Ailes&#x27;s &quot;enemies&quot; that he was &quot;preparing to kick your a** in the next life&quot;. Ailes had the year before been fired from Fox News after women alleged he sexually harassed them. In September 2017, several months after Bill O&#x27;Reilly was fired from Fox News in the wake of women alleging he sexually harassed them, Hannity hosted O&#x27;Reilly on his show. Some Fox News employees criticized the decision. According to CNN, during the interview, Hannity found kinship with O&#x27;Reilly as he appeared &quot;to feel that he and O&#x27;Reilly have both become victims of liberals looking to silence them.&quot;

===Obama administration conflict===
In September 2009, the Obama administration engaged in a verbal conflict with Fox News Channel. On September 20, President Barack Obama appeared on all major news programs except Fox News, a snub partially in response to remarks about him by commentators Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity and Fox coverage of Obama&#x27;s health-care proposal.

In late September 2009, Obama&#x27;s senior advisor David Axelrod and Roger Ailes met in secret to attempt to smooth out tensions between the two camps. Two weeks later, White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel referred to FNC as &quot;not a news network&quot; and communications director Anita Dunn said &quot;Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party&quot;. Obama commented: &quot;If media is operating basically as a talk radio format, then that&#x27;s one thing, and if it&#x27;s operating as a news outlet, then that&#x27;s another.&quot; Emanuel said it was important &quot;to not have the CNNs and the others in the world basically be led in following Fox&quot;.

Within days, it was reported that Fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official Ken Feinberg, with bureau chiefs from the White House press pool (ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN) coming to Fox&#x27;s defense. A bureau chief said: &quot;If any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing, it has nothing to do with Fox or the White House or the substance of the issues.&quot; Shortly after the story broke, the White House admitted to a low-level mistake, saying Fox had not made a specific request to interview Feinberg. Fox White House correspondent Major Garrett said he had not made a specific request, but had a &quot;standing request from me as senior White House correspondent on Fox to interview any newsmaker at the Treasury at any given time news is being made&quot;.

On November 8, 2009, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported an unnamed Democratic consultant was warned by the White House not to appear on Fox News again. According to the article, Dunn claimed in an e-mail to have checked with colleagues who &quot;deal with TV issues&quot; who denied telling anyone to avoid Fox. Patrick Caddell, a Fox News contributor and former pollster for President Jimmy Carter, said he had spoken with other Democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the White House.

On October 2, 2013, Fox News host Anna Kooiman cited on the air a fake story from the &quot;National Report&quot; parody site, which claimed Obama had offered to keep the International Museum of Muslim Cultures open with cash from his own pocket.

=== Journalistic ethical standards ===
Fox News attracted controversy in April 2018 when it was revealed primetime host Sean Hannity had defended Trump&#x27;s then personal attorney Michael Cohen on air without disclosing Cohen was his lawyer. On April 9, 2018, federal agents from the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office served a search warrant on Cohen&#x27;s office and residence. On the air, Hannity defended Cohen and criticized the federal action, calling it &quot;highly questionable&quot; and &quot;an unprecedented abuse of power&quot;. On April 16, 2018, in a court hearing, Cohen&#x27;s lawyers told the judge that Cohen had ten clients in 2017–2018 but did &quot;traditional legal tasks&quot; for only three: Trump, Elliott Broidy, and a &quot;prominent person&quot; who did not wish to be named for fear of being &quot;embarrassed&quot;. The federal judge ordered the revelation of the third client, whom Cohen&#x27;s lawyers named as Hannity.

Hannity was not sanctioned by Fox News for this breach of journalistic ethics, with Fox News releasing a statement that the channel was unaware of Hannity&#x27;s relationship to Cohen and that it had &quot;spoken to Sean and he continues to have our full support.&quot; Media ethics experts said that Hannity&#x27;s disclosure failure was a major breach of journalistic ethics and that the network should have suspended or fired him for it.

=== NYC Human Rights Law violations ===
In mid-2021, Fox News agreed to pay a $1 million settlement to New York City after its Commission on Human Rights cited &quot;a pattern of violating the NYC Human Rights Law&quot;. A Fox News spokesperson claimed that &quot;FOX News Media has already been in full compliance across the board, but [settled] to continue enacting extensive preventive measures against all forms of discrimination and harassment.&quot;

=== Climate denial and misinformation ===
During the May 22, 2023, episode of Fox News Tonight, discussing Roman climate protesters drawing attention on drought and floods in Italy, the correspondent Trace Gallagher downplayed the role of climate change for the recent meteorological situation pointing at Italian history.

==International transmission==

The Fox News Channel feed has international availability via multiple providers, while &quot;Fox Extra&quot; segments provide alternate programming. Fox News is carried in more than 40 countries.

===Australia===
In Australia, FNC is broadcast on the dominant pay television provider Foxtel, which is 65% owned by News Corp Australia, the Australian arm of News Corp and the sister company of FNC-owner Fox Corporation. Local cable news channel Sky News Australia is wholly owned by News Corp Australia and is therefore FNC&#x27;s de facto sister channel, although has formal partnerships with FNC competitor CNN as well as both ABC News and CBS News.

===Brazil===
FNC reached Brazil through Sky Brasil on November 1, 2002, after being introduced at ABTA 2002. On January 8, 2003, Sky Brasil added interactive functions for the channel exclusively from the provider.

Commercials on FNC are replaced with &quot;Fox Extra&quot;. It is available on Vivo TV.

===Canada===
Fox had initially planned to launch a joint venture with Canwest&#x27;s Global Television Network, tentatively named Fox News Canada, which would have featured a mixture of U.S. and Canadian news programming (MSNBC had backed a similar venture with Rogers and Shaw). As a result, the CRTC denied a 2003 application requesting permission for Fox News Channel to be carried in Canada. However, in March 2004, a Fox executive said the venture had been shelved; in November of that year, the CRTC added Fox News to its whitelist of foreign channels that may be carried by television providers.

In May 2023, the CRTC announced that it would open a public consultation regarding the channel&#x27;s carriage in Canada, acting upon complaints by the LGBT advocacy group Egale Canada surrounding a March 2023 episode of &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; that contained content described as &quot;malicious misinformation&quot; regarding trans, non-binary, gender non-conforming, and two-spirit communities, including &quot;the inflammatory and false claim that trans people are &#x27;targeting&#x27; Christians.&quot;

===Mexico===
The channel&#x27;s international feed is being carried by cable provider Izzi Telecom.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, Fox News has been carried by cable providers UPC Nederland and CASEMA, and satellite provider Canaldigitaal; all have dropped the channel in recent years. At this time, only cable provider Caiway (available in a limited number of towns in the central part of the country) is broadcasting the channel. The channel was also carried by IPTV provider KNIPPR (owned by T-Mobile).

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, FNC is broadcast on Channel 088 of pay satellite operator SKY Network Television&#x27;s digital platform. It was formerly broadcast overnight on free-to-air UHF New Zealand TV channel Prime (owned by SKY); this was discontinued in January 2010, reportedly due to an expiring broadcasting license. Fox News&#x27; former parent company News Corporation had a stake in both SKY and Prime until 2014.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, Fox News Channel is available on PTCL Smart TV and a number of cable and IPTV operators.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, Fox News Channel is available on Sky Cable Channels 138 (Metro Manila) and 510 (Regional), Cablelink Channel 224 (Metro Manila) and G Sat Channel 50. It was available on Cignal Channel 131 until January 1, 2021, due to contract expiration; however, the channel returned on June 16, 2022.

=== Portugal ===
In Portugal, Fox News was available on Meo. The channel is however no longer available on the operator and it is not carried by other Portuguese TV operators.

===Scandinavia===
Between 2003 and 2006, in Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries, FNC was broadcast 16 hours a day on TV8 (with &quot;Fox News Extra&quot; segments replacing U.S. advertising). Fox News was dropped by TV8 and replaced by German news channel Deutsche Welle in September 2006.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, FNC is broadcast on Channel 702 on pay-TV operator StarHub TV, as well on Channel 165 on Singtel TV. Both providers also broadcast its sister channel, Sky News.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, FNC is broadcast on StarSat.

The most popular pay television operator, DStv, does not offer FNC in its channel bouquet.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, Fox News was available on Movistar Plus+. The channel was part of the operator since its first incarnation as Canal Satellite Digital in the early 2000s, but was later removed from the operator&#x27;s satellite offer by March 2023, and ceased transmission to the remaining offers on July 9, 2024. The channel is not carried by other Spanish TV operators.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
FNC was carried in the United Kingdom by Sky, which was 40-percent owned by 21st Century Fox at the time, and operates its own domestic news channel Sky News. On August 29, 2017, Sky dropped Fox News; the broadcaster said its carriage was not &quot;commercially viable&quot; due to average viewership of fewer than 2,000 viewers per day. The company said the decision was unrelated to 21st Century Fox&#x27;s proposed acquisition of the remainder of Sky plc (which ultimately led to a bidding war that resulted in its acquisition by Comcast instead).

The potential co-ownership had prompted concerns from critics of the deal, who felt Sky News could similarly undergo a shift to an opinionated format with a right-wing viewpoint. However, such a move would violate Ofcom broadcast codes, which requires all news programming to show due impartiality. The channel&#x27;s broadcasts in the country have violated this rule on several occasions, while the channel also violated election silence rules by broadcasting analysis of the 2016 Brexit referendum while polls were still open (the channel was blacked out while polls were open during the 2017 general election to comply with the rule).

<text>Freeciv is a single- and multiplayer turn-based strategy game for workstations and personal computers inspired by the proprietary &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization&quot; series. It is available for most desktop computer operating systems and available in an online browser version. Released under the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later, &quot;Freeciv&quot; is free and open-source software. The game&#x27;s default settings are closest to &quot;Civilization II&quot;, in both gameplay and graphics, including the units and the isometric grid. However, with a lot of multiplayer games being played in longturn communities, rulesets and additional variants have evolved away from the original ruleset. &quot;Freeciv&quot; is playable online on various public and private servers.

Players take the role of tribal leaders in 4000 B.C. who must guide their peoples through the centuries. Over time, new technologies are discovered, which allow the construction of new city buildings and the deployment of new units. Players can wage war on one another or form diplomatic relationships.

The game ends when one civilization has eradicated all others or accomplished the goal of space colonization, or at a given deadline. If more than one civilization remains at the deadline, the player with the highest score wins. Points are awarded for the size of a civilization, its wealth, and cultural and scientific advances.

==History==
At the computer science department at Aarhus University, three students, avid players of &quot;XPilot&quot; and of Sid Meier&#x27;s &quot;Civilization&quot;, which was a stand-alone PC game for MS-DOS, decided to find out whether the two could be fused into an X-based multiplayer &quot;Civilization&quot;-like strategy game. The students—Peter Unold, Claus Leth Gregersen and Allan Ove Kjeldbjerg—started development in November 1995; the first playable version was released in January 1996, with bugfixing and small enhancements until April. The rules of the game were close to &quot;Civilization&quot;, while the client/server architecture was basically that of &quot;XPilot&quot;.

For the developers, &quot;Freeciv&quot; 1.0 was a successful proof of concept, but a rather boring game, so they went back to &quot;XPilot&quot;. Other players and developers took over; they made the game available on many other operating systems, including Linux, Solaris, Ultrix, AmigaOS, and Microsoft Windows. Linux distributions started to include &quot;Freeciv&quot;.

The main development goal remained to make a &quot;Civilization&quot;-like game playable over the Internet, with participants on different continents, even when connected with 14400 bit/s modems. &quot;Freeciv&quot; achieved this by using an asynchronous client-server protocol: during each turn, human users play concurrently, and their actions are sent to the server for processing without awaiting the results. This kept the game playable with network latency up to a few hundreds of milliseconds.
In 1998, computer players were added; they could soon beat newcomers to the game with ease, using only minor forms of cheating. Computer players are implemented directly in the server; they do not play concurrently with human players, but separately, in between turns.

The game grew in popularity. A public server was installed on which games could be played around the clock; it retained the games and published a post-game analysis webpage with per-player statistics and an animated map replay.

Subsequent 1.x releases improved the GUI, improved the gameplay, optimized playability over poor connections, and added many small features. Over time, the winning strategy proved to be &quot;city smallpox&quot;, i.e. sprawling the map with many small cities as fast as possible; whoever could develop fastest would win the game, and growing and developing individual cities was not worthwhile.

In practice, from around 2002, experienced players would form teams at the start of the game; a fork of &quot;Freeciv&quot; included specific features for team play.

Version 2.0, released in 2005, introduced several important changes. New team playing features and advanced diplomacy made cooperative gaming more attractive. Adjustments to various costs and benefits put an end to the dominance of the city smallpox strategy that left many of the game&#x27;s features unused; developing one&#x27;s empire now necessitated a careful plan for city development, including the use of trade routes and phases of &quot;rapture&quot;, in which city populations grow quickly, under relatively peaceful conditions. As a result, multiplayer games were almost always played in teams and typically took longer to finish when compared to 1.x games.

In 2006, TCP and UDP port number 5556 was assigned to &quot;Freeciv&quot; by IANA. In 2017, after being hosted on Gna! for 15 years, &quot;Freeciv&quot; moved its source repository to GitHub.

===Reception and impact===
In 2000, CNN placed &quot;Freeciv&quot; among the &quot;Top 10 Linux games for the holidays&quot;. In 2005, in an O&#x27;Reilly article on &quot;Open Source Mac Gaming&quot;, &quot;Freeciv&quot; was recommended. In 2008, &quot;APC&quot; named Freeciv among the &quot;Top 5 best (free) open source games&quot;. &quot;Linux Format&quot; selected it as &quot;HotPick&quot; in April 2010 and in October 2014.

&quot;Freeciv&quot; was described as an example in &quot;The Art of Unix Programming&quot; by Eric S. Raymond. Studies and courses have used &quot;Freeciv&quot; as a platform for experimenting with the design and programming of intelligent agents.

==Design==
Freeciv is very configurable, down to the specific rules, so it can be played in Freeciv (default) mode, &quot;Civilization&quot; mode, &quot;Civilization II&quot; mode, or a custom mode. One or several players act as game administrators and can configure the game rules. Typically modified rules are:

* Number of players required before the game can be started. The maximum number of players is 126 in the latest version of Freeciv.
* Speed of technological development
* Whether there should be computer controlled players
* Whether (computer controlled) barbarians should invade player settlements
* How close cities can be built to one another
* How continents and islands are generated and distributed over the map
* The map size, where the maximum map size is 2,048,000 map tiles (128,000 before 2.4.0)
* Map topology (rectangular or hexagonal tiling; whether it wraps horizontally and/or vertically)

In order to play a game of Freeciv, a user must start up a Freeciv client and connect it to a Freeciv server. Initially, the server is in pre-game phase; in this phase, clients can connect and game configuration parameters can be changed. At some point, the server may be ordered to start a game; in response, it creates game players (nations) and the game map, and assigns every player to either a Freeciv client or a computer player, as specified by the configuration. From that point on, the game will run until it ends or is terminated; the server can never get back into pre-game state. The user can also start a game directly from the client: this automatically starts a Freeciv server, connects to it and starts the game.

==Features==
Freeciv&#x27;s graphics system is configurable: originally, map display was always in overhead mode (like in &quot;Civ I&quot;). Isometric mode (like in &quot;Civ II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;) and optionally hexagonal tiling (like in &quot;Civ V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;) were added later. In both modes, look can be further customized by switching to an alternative set of graphics (called a &quot;tileset&quot;). The sounds can be replaced as well. Freeciv supports human-to-human multiplayer gameplay and artificial intelligence (AI) computer players. While the game is turn based, human players move simultaneously. The AI players move separately, partly at the start of a turn, partly at the end.

In releases before 2.0, AI players could not engage in diplomatic relationships with human players. Under the current releases, AI players will engage in a very predictable, rules-based diplomacy. Version 2.2.0 included a map editor, termed Civworld. It can create new scenarios, as well as edit the map currently being played. Basic scripting is available with Freeciv, but is not available in Civworld. Version 2.3 increased the limit of players from 30 to 126.
There are different clients available SDL, GTK+ (version3) and Xaw3D A Qt client was added in version 2.5. The Freeciv interface is available in over 30 different languages. The addition of Gaelic was covered on BBC TV.

==Ports and variants==
Originally developed on IRIX, Freeciv has been ported to many different operating systems: it is distributed with many Linux distributions, offers installers for Microsoft Windows, and has been known to run on Mac OS X, MorphOS, Solaris, Ultrix, QNX, OS/2, Cygwin, AmigaOS, AROS, RISC OS, Maemo, ZETA, SkyOS, various BSDs, and smartphones and tablets running Android.

Between version 2.4 and version 3.1 Mac OS X was not supported, but returned in March of 2023. As of version 2.3, Windows versions older than Windows XP SP3 are no longer supported. Freeciv is available in the PortableApps format.

===Freeciv21===
Freeciv21 is a fork of the original Freeciv project started with the intention of modernizing the code and the client interface, and also adjusting the software more to the needs of multiplayer longturn variant. It was started by enthusiasts within the Longturn.net community. As of January 2023 it is in late developing stage. The first standard Longturn game played on Fc21 software was LT75, started in November 2022.

===fciv.net===
Fciv.net is a web-based variant of Freeciv which focuses on 3D graphics. It uses the Three.js 3D engine. the site is not working.

===freecivx.net===

Freecivx.net is a free-to-play variant of Freeciv which focuses on 3D graphics. It uses the Three.js 3D engine and OpenAI for AI/LLM chat in-game assistance. Freecivx has a Java client and server in development.

===Freeciv-web===
Freeciv-web is a version of Freeciv playable online in any modern web browser. It supports 2D isometric graphics or 3D graphics using WebGL. The game is a fork of the Freeciv project, with the goal of redesigning the desktop game into a version which can be played online. Freeciv-web introduced several new features, such as play-by-email support freely available to anyone online, and support for playing the game on any real-world map location by choosing a map using Mapbox, which is not available in commercial games in the genre. The game&#x27;s default settings are closest to &quot;Civilization II&quot;, both in gameplay and graphics (including the units and the isometric grid). The proposal to create a web-version of Freeciv was made 6 April 2007 on the Freeciv mailing lists, and documented on the Freeciv.org wiki. Freeciv-web was originally created by Andreas Røsdal, but is now maintained by several Freeciv developers on GitHub.

Freeciv-web is free and open-source software. The Freeciv C server is released under the GNU General Public License, while the Freeciv-web client is released under the GNU Affero General Public License. Freeciv-web supports human-to-human multiplayer gameplay and artificial intelligence (AI) computer players. Its features are similar to the Freeciv C client, although not all of the user-interface has been ported from the C client yet.

The Freeciv-web server on play.freeciv.org was shut down in March 2018, but the project was revived by a group of volunteers on freecivweb.org. Freeciv-web can be played online at a number of servers such as freecivweb.org. All the features required to play a full game of Freeciv are in place. Most servers offer multiple varieties of the game: single-player, multiplayer free-for-all, play-by-email and longturn.

===Longturn variants===

Freeciv &quot;Longturn&quot; is a specialized large-group-multiplayer-online-strategy variant of Freeciv featuring daylong game turns with large amounts of human opponents per map, allowing for optimal timing to build up strategic plans and readapt them to the circumstances of each turn. Matches can last anytime from a few weeks to months, and commonly involve 20 to 30 players in each one.

Longturn&#x27;s first game, now called LT0, started around 2004 on the Polish Civilization fanpage civ.org.pl and is now conducted at Longturn.net. It was decided that the game is a bit too slow-paced, so a new &quot;3X movement&quot; ruleset was devised – basically, all units had their movement points and vision radius tripled. As of December 2022, the latest game was LT76. Changes to settings or rulesets are discussed in the Longturn forum. and, recently, Longturn Discord server where the community is currently centered. There is ongoing development of a few non-standard rulesets specifically adjusted for longturn multiplayer games, diverging from the rules of the original Civilization which was created as a single-player game.

&quot;Greatturn&quot; was a similar concept on another server. &quot;FreeCivWeb.org&quot; also offers longturn games (more than fifty have been played before mid-2021) with a multiplayer ruleset which is documented in great detail.

&quot;Power of Planets – Earth&quot; (formerly known as &quot;GaCivs&quot;) is a free-to-play MMO-RTS variant based on FreeCiv. The ruleset was devised to support long-term time-based gameplay instead of turn-based strategy.

<doc id="11123" wikidata="Q8913" url="?curid=11123" title="Fornax">
<text>Fornax () is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere, partly ringed by the celestial river Eridanus. Its name is Latin for furnace. It was named by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1756. Fornax is one of the 88 modern constellations.

The three brightest stars—Alpha, Beta and Nu Fornacis—form a flattened triangle facing south. With an apparent magnitude of 3.91, Alpha Fornacis is the brightest star in Fornax. Six star systems have been found to have exoplanets. The Fornax Dwarf galaxy is a small faint satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. NGC 1316 is a relatively close radio galaxy. 

The Hubble&#x27;s Ultra-Deep Field is located within Fornax. 

It is the 41st largest constellation in the night-sky, occupying an area of 398 square degrees. It is located in the first quadrant of the southern hemisphere (SQ1) and can be seen at latitudes between +50° and -90° during the month of December.

==History==
The French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille first described the constellation in French as &quot;le Fourneau Chymique&quot; (the Chemical Furnace) with an alembic and receiver in his early catalogue, before abbreviating it to &quot;le Fourneau&quot; on his planisphere in 1752, after he had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Lacaille Latinised the name to &quot;Fornax Chimiae&quot; on his 1763 chart.
==Characteristics==
The constellation Eridanus borders Fornax to the east, north and south, while Cetus, Sculptor and Phoenix gird it to the north, west and south respectively. Covering 397.5 square degrees and 0.964% of the night sky, it ranks 41st of the 88 constellations in size, The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;For&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 8 segments (&quot;illustrated in infobox&quot;). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −23.76° and −39.58°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 50°N.

==Features==
===Stars===

Lacaille gave Bayer designations to 27 stars now named Alpha to Omega Fornacis, labelling two stars 3.5 degrees apart as Gamma, three stars Eta, two stars Iota, two Lambda and three Chi. Phi Fornacis was added by Gould, and Theta and Omicron were dropped by Gould and Baily respectively. Upsilon, too, was later found to be two stars and designated as such. Overall, there are 59 stars within the constellation&#x27;s borders brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5. However, there are no stars brighter than the fourth magnitude.

The three brightest stars form a flattish triangle, with Alpha (also called Dalim) and Nu Fornacis marking its eastern and western points and Beta Fornacis marking the shallow southern apex. Originally designated 12 Eridani by John Flamsteed, Alpha Fornacis was named by Lacaille as the brightest star in the new constellation. It is a binary star that can be resolved by small amateur telescopes. With an apparent magnitude of 3.91, the primary is a yellow-white subgiant 1.21 times as massive as the Sun that has begun to cool and expand after exhausting its core hydrogen, having swollen to 1.9 times the Sun&#x27;s radius. Of magnitude 6.5, the secondary star is 0.78 times as massive as the Sun. It has been identified as a blue straggler, and has either accumulated material from, or merged with, a third star in the past. It is a strong source of X-rays. The pair is 46.4 ± 0.3 light-years distant from Earth.

Beta Fornacis is a yellow-hued giant star of spectral type G8IIIb of magnitude 4.5 that has cooled and swelled to 11 times the Sun&#x27;s diameter, 178 ± 2 light-years from Earth. It is a red clump giant, which means it has undergone helium flash and is currently generating energy through the fusion of helium at its core.

Nu Fornacis is 370 ± 10 light-years distant from Earth. It is a blue giant star of spectral type B9.5IIIspSi that is 3.65 ± 0.18 times as massive and around 245 times as luminous as the Sun, with 3.2 ± 0.4 times its diameter. It varies in luminosity over a period of 1.89 days—the same as its rotational period. This is because of differences in abundances of metals in its atmosphere; it belongs to a class of star known as an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable.

Shining with an apparent magnitude of 5.89, Epsilon Fornacis is a binary star system located 104.4 ± 0.3 light-years distant from Earth. Its component stars orbit each other every 37 years. The primary star is around 12 billion years old and has cooled and expanded to 2.53 times the diameter of the Sun, while having only 91% of its mass.
 Omega Fornacis is a binary star system composed of a blue main-sequence star of spectral type B9.5V and magnitude 4.96, and a white main sequence star of spectral type A7V and magnitude 7.88. The system is 470 ± 10 light-years distant from Earth.

Kappa Fornacis is a triple star system composed of a yellow giant and a pair of red dwarfs.

R Fornacis is a long-period variable and carbon star.

LP 944-20 is a brown dwarf of spectral type M9 that has around 7% the mass of the Sun. Approximately 21 light-years distant from Earth, it is a faint object with an apparent magnitude of 18.69. Observations published in 2007 showed that the atmosphere of LP 944-20 contains much lithium and that it has dusty clouds. Smaller and less luminous still is 2MASS 0243-2453, a T-type brown dwarf of spectral type T6. With a surface temperature of 1040–1100 K, it has 2.4–4.1% the mass of the Sun, a diameter 9.2 to 10.6% of that of the Sun, and an age of 0.4–1.7 billion years.

Six star systems in Fornax have been found to have planets:
* Lambda2 Fornacis is a star about 1.2 times as massive as the Sun with a planet about as massive as Neptune, discovered by doppler spectroscopy in 2009. The planet has an orbit of around 17.24 days.
* HD 20868 is an orange dwarf with a mass around 78% that of the Sun, 151 ± 10 light-years away from Earth. It was found to have an orbiting planet approximately double the mass of Jupiter with a period of 380 days.
* WASP-72 is a star around 1.4 times as massive that has begun to cool and expand off the main sequence, reaching double the Sun&#x27;s diameter. It has a planet around as massive as Jupiter orbiting it every 2.2 days.
* HD 20781 and HD 20782 are a pair of sunlike yellow main sequence stars that orbit each other. Each has been found to have planets.
* HR 858 is a near naked eye visible star in Fornax, 31.3 parsecs away. In May 2019, it was announced to have at least 3 exoplanets as observed by transit method of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.

Local Group

NGC 1049 is a globular cluster 500,000 light-years from Earth. It is in the Fornax Dwarf Galaxy. NGC 1360 is a planetary nebula in Fornax with a magnitude of approximately 9.0, 1,280 light-years from Earth. Its central star is of magnitude 11.4, an unusually bright specimen. It is five times the size of the famed Ring Nebula in Lyra at 6.5 arcminutes. Unlike the Ring Nebula, NGC 1360 is clearly elliptical.

The Fornax Dwarf galaxy is a dwarf galaxy that is part of the Local Group of galaxies. It is not visible in amateur telescopes, despite its relatively small distance of 500,000 light-years.

Helmi stream is a small galactic stream in Fornax. This small galaxy was destroyed by Milky Way 6 billion years ago. There was candidate for extragalactic planet, HIP 13044 b.

Outside

NGC 1097 is a barred spiral galaxy in Fornax, about 45 million light-years from Earth. At magnitude 9, it is visible in medium amateur telescopes. It is notable as a Seyfert galaxy with strong spectral emissions indicating ionized gases and a central supermassive black hole.

Fornax Cluster
The Fornax Cluster is a cluster of galaxies lying at a distance of 19 megaparsecs (62 million light-years). It is the second richest galaxy cluster within 100 million light-years, after the considerably larger Virgo Cluster, and may be associated with the nearby Eridanus Group. It lies primarily in the constellation Fornax, with its southern boundaries partially crossing into the constellation of Eridanus, and covers an area of sky about 6° across or about 28 sq degrees. The Fornax cluster is a part of larger Fornax Wall. Down are some famous objects in this cluster:

NGC 1365 is another barred spiral galaxy located at a distance of 56 million light-years from Earth. Like NGC 1097, it is also a Seyfert galaxy. Its bar is a center of star formation and shows extensions of the spiral arms&#x27; dust lanes. The bright nucleus indicates the presence of an active galactic nucleus – a galaxy with a supermassive black hole at the center, accreting matter from the bar. It is a 10th magnitude galaxy associated with the Fornax Cluster.

Fornax A is a radio galaxy with extensive radio lobes that corresponds to the optical galaxy NGC 1316, a 9th-magnitude galaxy. One of the closer active galaxies to Earth at a distance of 62 million light-years, Fornax A appears in the optical spectrum as a large elliptical galaxy with dust lanes near its core. These dust lanes have caused astronomers to discern that it recently merged with a small spiral galaxy. Because it has a high rate of type Ia supernovae, NGC 1316 has been used to determine the size of the universe. The jets producing the radio lobes are not particularly powerful, giving the lobes a more diffuse, knotted structure due to interactions with the intergalactic medium. Associated with this peculiar galaxy is an entire cluster of galaxies.

NGC 1399 is a large elliptical galaxy in the Southern constellation Fornax, the central galaxy in the Fornax cluster.

The galaxy is 66 million light-years away from Earth. With a diameter of 130 000 light-years, it is one of the largest galaxies in the Fornax cluster and slightly larger than Milky Way. William Herschel discovered this galaxy on October 22, 1835.

NGC 1386 is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation Eridanus. It is located at a distance of circa 53 million light years from Earth and has apparent dimensions of 3.89&#x27; x 1.349&#x27;. It is a Seyfert galaxy, the only one in Fornax Cluster.

NGC 1427A is an irregular galaxy in the constellation Eridanus. Its distance modulus has been estimated using the globular cluster luminosity function to be 31.01 ± 0.21 which is about 52 Mly. It is the brightest dwarf irregular member of the Fornax cluster and is in the foreground of the cluster&#x27;s central galaxy NGC 1399.

NGC 1460 is a barred lenticular galaxy in the constellation Eridanus. It was discovered by John Herschel on November 28, 1837. It is moving away from the Milky Way 1341 km/s. NGC 1460 has a Hubble classification of SB0, which indicates it is a barred lenticular galaxy. But, this one contains a huge bar at its core. The bar is spreading from center to the edge of the galaxy, as seen on Hubble image in the box. This bar is one of the largest seen in barred lenticular galaxies.

There are also first ultracompact dwarf galaxies discovered.

Distant universe

Fornax has been the target of investigations into the furthest reaches of the universe. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field is located within Fornax, and the Fornax Cluster, a small cluster of galaxies, lies primarily within Fornax. At a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society in Britain, a team from University of Queensland described 40 unknown &quot;dwarf&quot; galaxies in this constellation; follow-up observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory&#x27;s Very Large Telescope revealed that ultra compact dwarfs are much smaller than previously known dwarf galaxies, about across.
UDFj-39546284 is a candidate protogalaxy located in Fornax, although recent analyses have suggested it is likely to be a lower redshift source.

GRB 190114C was a notable gamma ray burst explosion from a galaxy 4.5 billion light years away near the Fornax constellation, that was initially detected in January 2019. According to astronomers, &quot;the brightest light ever seen from Earth [to date] ... [the] biggest explosion in the Universe since the Big Bang&quot;.

<text>Francesco Borromini (, ), byname of Francesco Castelli (; 25 September 1599 – 2 August 1667), was an Italian architect born in the modern Swiss canton of Ticino who, with his contemporaries Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Pietro da Cortona, was a leading figure in the emergence of Roman Baroque architecture.

A keen student of the architecture of Michelangelo and the ruins of Antiquity, Borromini developed an inventive and distinctive, if somewhat idiosyncratic, architecture employing manipulations of Classical architectural forms, geometrical rationales in his plans and symbolic meanings in his buildings. He seems to have had a sound understanding of structures, which perhaps Bernini and Cortona, who were principally trained in other areas of the visual arts, lacked. His soft lead drawings are particularly distinctive. He appears to have been a self-taught scholar, amassing a large library by the end of his life.

His career was constrained by his personality. Unlike Bernini who easily adopted the mantle of the charming courtier in his pursuit of important commissions, Borromini was both melancholic and quick in temper which resulted in his withdrawing from certain jobs. His conflicted character led him to a death by suicide in 1667.

Probably because his work was idiosyncratic, his subsequent influence was not widespread but is apparent in the Piedmontese works of Guarino Guarini and, as a fusion with the architectural modes of Bernini and Cortona, in the late Baroque architecture of Northern Europe. Later critics of the Baroque, such as Francesco Milizia and the English architect Sir John Soane, were particularly critical of Borromini&#x27;s work. From the late nineteenth century onwards, interest has revived in the works of Borromini and his architecture has become appreciated for its inventiveness.

==Early life and first works==

Borromini was born at Bissone, near Lugano in today&#x27;s Ticino, which was at the time a bailiwick of the Swiss Confederacy. He was the son of a stonemason and began his career as a stonemason himself. He soon went to Milan to study and practice his craft. He moved to Rome in 1619 and started working for Carlo Maderno, his distant relative, at St. Peter&#x27;s and then also at the Palazzo Barberini. When Maderno died in 1629, he and Pietro da Cortona continued to work on the palace under the direction of Bernini. Once he had become established in Rome, he changed his name from Castelli to Borromini, a name deriving from his mother&#x27;s family and perhaps also out of regard for St Charles Borromeo.

== Major works ==

=== San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (San Carlino) ===
In 1634, Borromini received his first major independent commission to design the church, cloister and monastic buildings of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (also known as San Carlino). Situated on the Quirinal Hill in Rome, the complex was designed for the Spanish Trinitarians, a religious order. The monastic buildings and the cloister were completed first after which construction of the church took place during the period 1638-1641 and in 1646 it was dedicated to San Carlo Borromeo. The church is considered by many to be an exemplary masterpiece of Roman Baroque architecture. San Carlino is remarkably small given its significance to Baroque architecture; it has been noted that the whole building would fit into one of the dome piers of Saint Peter&#x27;s. 
The site was not an easy one; it was a corner site and the space was limited. Borromini positioned the church on the corner of two intersecting roads. Although the idea for the serpentine façade must have been conceived fairly early on, probably in the mid-1630s, it was only constructed towards the end of Borromini&#x27;s life and the upper part was not completed until after the architect&#x27;s death.

Borromini devised the complex ground plan of the church from interlocking geometrical configurations, a typical Borromini device for constructing plans. The resulting effect is that the interior lower walls appear to weave in and out, partly alluding to a cross form, partly to a hexagonal form and partly to an oval form; geometrical figures that are all found explicitly in the dome above. The area of the pendentives marks the transition from the lower wall order to the oval opening of the dome. Illuminated by windows hidden from a viewer below, interlocking octagons, crosses and hexagons diminish in size as the dome rises to a lantern with the symbol of the Trinity.

=== Oratory of Saint Philip Neri (Oratorio dei Filippini) ===

In the late sixteenth century, the Congregation of the Filippini (also known as the Oratorians) rebuilt the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella (known as the Chiesa Nuova -new church) in central Rome. In the 1620s, on a site adjacent to the church, the Fathers commissioned designs for their own residence and for an oratory (or &quot;oratorio&quot; in Italian) in which to hold their spiritual exercises. These exercises combined preaching and music in a form which became immensely popular and highly influential on the development of the musical oratorio.

The architect Paolo Maruscelli drew up plans for the site (which survive) and the sacristy was begun in 1629 and was in use by 1635. After a substantial benefaction in January 1637, however, Borromini was appointed as architect. By 1640, the oratory was in use, a taller and richer clock tower was accepted, and by 1643, the relocated library was complete. The striking brick curved façade adjacent to the church entrance has an unusual pediment and does not entirely correspond to the oratory room behind it. The white oratory interior has a ribbed vault and a complex wall arrangement of engaged pilasters along with freestanding columns supporting first-level balconies. The altar wall was substantially reworked at a later date.

Borromini&#x27;s relations with the Oratorians were often fraught; there were heated arguments over the design and the selection of building materials. By 1650, the situation came to a head and in 1652 the Oratorians appointed another architect.

However, with the help of his Oratorian friend and provost Virgilio Spada, Borromini documented his own account of the building of the oratory and the residence and an illustrated version was published in Italian in 1725 

=== Sant&#x27;Ivo alla Sapienza ===
From 1640 to 1650, he worked on the design of the church of Sant&#x27;Ivo alla Sapienza and its courtyard, near University of Rome La Sapienza palace. It was initially the church of the Roman Archiginnasio. He had been initially recommended for the commission in 1632, by his then-supervisor for the work at the Palazzo Barberini, Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The site, like many in cramped Rome, is challenged by external perspectives. It was built at the end of Giacomo della Porta&#x27;s long courtyard. The dome and cochlear steeple are peculiar, and reflect the idiosyncratic architectural motifs that distinguish Borromini from contemporaries. Inside, the nave has an unusual centralized plan circled by alternating concave and convex-ending cornices, leading to a dome decorated with linear arrays of stars and putti. The geometry of the structure is a symmetric six-pointed star; from the centre of the floor, the cornice looks like two equilateral triangles forming a hexagon, but three of the points are clover-like, while the other three are concavely clipped. The innermost columns are points on a circle. The fusion of feverish and dynamic baroque excesses with rationalistic geometry is an excellent match for a church in a papal institution of higher learning.

=== Sant&#x27;Agnese in Agone ===
Borromini was one of several architects involved in the building of the church of Sant’Agnese in Agone in Rome. Not only were some of his design intentions changed by succeeding architects but the net result is a building which reflects, rather unhappily, a mix of different approaches.

The decision to rebuild the church was taken in 1652 as part of Pope Innocent X&#x27;s project to enhance the Piazza Navona, the urban space onto which his family palace, the Palazzo Pamphili, faced. The first plans for a Greek Cross church were drawn up by Girolamo Rainaldi and his son Carlo Rainaldi, who relocated the main entrance from the Via di Santa Maria dell&#x27;Anima to the Piazza Navona. The foundations were laid and much of the lower level walls had been constructed when the Rainaldis were dismissed due to criticisms of the design and Borromini was appointed in their stead.

Borromini began a much more innovative approach to the façade which was expanded to include parts of the adjacent Palazzo Pamphili and gain space for his two bell towers. Construction of the façade proceeded up to the cornice level and the dome completed as far as the lantern. On the interior, he placed columns against the piers of the lower order which was mainly completed.

In 1655, Innocent X died and the project lost momentum. In 1657, Borromini resigned and Carlo Rainaldi was recalled who made a number of significant changes to Borromini&#x27;s design. Further alterations were made by Bernini including the façade pediment. In 1668, Carlo Rainaldi returned as architect and Ciro Ferri received the commission to fresco the dome interior which it is highly unlikely that Borromini intended. Further large-scale statuary and coloured marbling were also added; again, these are not part of Borromini&#x27;s design repertoire which was orientated to white stucco architectural and symbolic motifs.

===The Re Magi Chapel of the Propaganda Fide===
The College of the Propagation of the Faith or Propaganda Fide in Rome includes the Re Magi Chapel by Borromini, generally considered by architectural historians to be one of his most spatially unified architectural interiors.

The chapel replaced a small oval chapel designed by his rival Bernini and was a late work in Borromini&#x27;s career; he was appointed as architect in 1648 but it was not until 1660 that construction of the chapel began and although the main body of work was completed by 1665, some of the decoration was finished after his death.

His façade to the Via di Propaganda Fide comprises seven bays articulated by giant pilasters. The central bay is a concave curve and accommodates the main entry into the college courtyard and complex, with the entrance to the chapel to the left and to the college to the right.

==Death and epitaph==
In the summer of 1667, and following the completion of the Falconieri chapel (the High Altar chapel) in San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, Borromini committed suicide in Rome by drawing his sword, resting the hilt against his bed, and falling on it &quot;with such force that it ran into [his] body, from one side to the other&quot; This was possibly as a result of nervous disorders and depression. The architect named cardinal Ulderico Carpegna executor of his will and bequeathed him money and objects of considerable value &quot;for&quot;, as he wrote, &quot;the infinite debt I have toward him&quot;. The prelate was a former patron who had commissioned Borromini important works of transformation and expansion of his palace at Fontana di Trevi. In his testament, Borromini wrote that he did not want any name on his burial and expressed the desire to be buried in the tomb of his kinsman Carlo Maderno in San Giovanni dei Fiorentini.

In recent times (in 1955), his name was added to the marble plaque below the tomb of Maderno and a commemorative plaque commissioned by the Swiss embassy in Rome was placed on a pillar of the church. This Latin inscription reads:

The adjective &quot;Ticinensis&quot; used in the plaque is an anachronism, since the name, related to the Ticino river, was chosen only in 1803, when the modern Canton was created by Napoleon.

== Honours ==

* Francesco Borromini was featured on the obverse of the 6th series 100 Swiss Franc banknote, which was in circulation from 1976 until 2000. 
This decision at that time caused polemics in Switzerland, started by the Swiss-Italian art historian Piero Bianconi. According to him, since in 17th century the territories which in 1803 became the Canton Ticino were Italian possessions of some Swiss cantons (Condominiums of the Twelve Cantons), Borromini could neither be defined Ticinese nor Swiss. The architect was also featured on the 7th series, which was a reserve emission and was never released. The reverse of both series shows architectural details from some of his major works.
* He is the subject of the film &quot;La Sapienza&quot; by Eugène Green released in 2015.

<text>A freedom fighter is a person engaged in a struggle to achieve political freedom, particularly against an established government. The term is typically reserved for those who are actively involved in armed or otherwise violent rebellion.

==Terminology==
Generally speaking, freedom fighters are people who use physical force to cause a change in the political and or social order. Notable examples include uMkhonto we Sizwe in South Africa, the Sons of Liberty in the American Revolution, the Irish Republican Army in Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front in Eritrea, the Mukti Bahini in Bangladesh Liberation War, and the National Resistance Army in Uganda, which were considered freedom fighters by supporters. However, a person who is campaigning for freedom through peaceful means may still be classed as a freedom fighter, though in common usage they are called political activists, as in the case of the Black Consciousness Movement. In India, &quot;Freedom fighter&quot; is an officially recognized category by the Indian government covering those who took part in the country&#x27;s independence movement; people in this category, which can also include dependant family members, get pensions and other benefits like special railway counters.

People who are described as &quot;freedom fighters&quot; are often also referenced as assassins, rebels, insurgents, or terrorists. This leads to the aphorism &quot;One man&#x27;s terrorist is another man&#x27;s freedom fighter&quot;. The degree to which this occurs depends on a variety of factors specific to the struggle in which a given freedom fighter group in engaged. During the Cold War, &quot;freedom fighter&quot; was first used with reference to the Hungarian rebels in 1956. Ronald Reagan picked up the term to explain America&#x27;s support of rebels in countries controlled by communist states or otherwise perceived to be under the influence of the Soviet Union, including the Contras in Nicaragua, UNITA in Angola and the multi-factional mujahideen in Afghanistan. 

A freedom fighter is different from a mercenary as they gain no direct material benefit from being involved in a conflict, though they may have no personal reason for being involved. Thus they are not considered mercenaries under the Geneva Convention and thus may in certain circumstances be protected by it (Mercenaries are not protected under the Geneva Convention and can be tried as criminals). In the media, the BBC tries to avoid the phrases &quot;terrorist&quot; or &quot;freedom fighter&quot;, except in attributed quotes, in favor of more neutral terms such as &quot;militant&quot;, &quot;guerrilla&quot;, &quot;assassin&quot;, &quot;insurgent&quot;, &quot;rebel&quot;, &quot;paramilitary&quot;, or &quot;militia&quot;.

<text>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States and its principal federal law enforcement agency. An agency of the United States Department of Justice, the FBI is a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the attorney general and the director of national intelligence. A leading American counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative organization, the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes.

Although many of the FBI&#x27;s functions are unique, its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and NCA, the New Zealand GCSB and the Russian FSB. Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad, the FBI is primarily a domestic agency, maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States, and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation. At an FBI field office, a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the director of national intelligence.

Despite its domestic focus, the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint, operating 60 Legal Attache (LEGAT) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe. These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries. The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas, just as the CIA has a limited domestic function. These activities generally require coordination across government agencies.

The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation, the BOI or BI for short. Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1935. The FBI headquarters is the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C. The FBI has a list of the top 10 most wanted fugitives.

== Mission, priorities and budget ==
=== Mission ===
The mission of the FBI is to &quot;protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States&quot;.

=== Priorities ===
Currently, the FBI&#x27;s top priorities are:

*Protect the United States from terrorist attacks
*Protect the United States against foreign intelligence operations, espionage, and cyber operations
*Combat significant cybercriminal activity
*Combat public corruption at all levels
*Protect civil rights
*Combat transnational criminal enterprises
*Combat major white-collar crime
*Combat significant violent crime

=== Budget ===
In the fiscal year 2019, the Bureau&#x27;s total budget was approximately $9.6 billion.

In the Authorization and Budget Request to Congress for fiscal year 2021, the FBI asked for $9,800,724,000. Of that money, $9,748,829,000 would be used for Salaries and Expenses (S&amp;E) and $51,895,000 for Construction. The S&amp;E program saw an increase of $199,673,000.

== History ==
=== Background ===
In 1896, the National Bureau of Criminal Identification was founded, providing agencies across the country with information to identify known criminals. The 1901 assassination of President William McKinley created a perception that the United States was under threat from anarchists. The Departments of Justice and Labor had been keeping records on anarchists for years, but President Theodore Roosevelt wanted more power to monitor them.

The Justice Department had been tasked with the regulation of interstate commerce since 1887, though it lacked the staff to do so. It had made little effort to relieve its staff shortage until the Oregon land fraud scandal at the turn of the 20th century. President Roosevelt instructed Attorney General Charles Bonaparte to organize an autonomous investigative service that would report only to the Attorney General.

Bonaparte contacted other agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service, for personnel, investigators in particular. On May 27, 1908, Congress forbade this use of Treasury employees by the Justice Department, citing fears that the new agency would serve as a secret police department. Again at Roosevelt&#x27;s urging, Bonaparte moved to organize a formal Bureau of Investigation, which would then have its own staff of special agents.

=== Creation of BOI ===
The Bureau of Investigation (BOI) was created on July 26, 1908. Attorney General Bonaparte, using Department of Justice expense funds, hired thirty-four people, including some veterans of the Secret Service, to work for a new investigative agency. Its first &quot;chief&quot; (the title is now &quot;director&quot;) was Stanley Finch. Bonaparte notified the Congress of these actions in December 1908.

The bureau&#x27;s first official task was visiting and making surveys of the houses of prostitution in preparation for enforcing the &quot;White Slave Traffic Act&quot; or Mann Act, passed on June 25, 1910. In 1932, the bureau was renamed the United States Bureau of Investigation.

=== Creation of FBI ===
The following year, 1933, the BOI was linked to the Bureau of Prohibition and rechristened the Division of Investigation (DOI); it became an independent service within the Department of Justice in 1935. In the same year, its name was officially changed from the Division of Investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

=== J. Edgar Hoover as FBI director ===
J. Edgar Hoover served as FBI director from 1924 to 1972, a combined 48 years with the BOI, DOI, and FBI. He was chiefly responsible for creating the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, or the FBI Laboratory, which officially opened in 1932, as part of his work to professionalize investigations by the government. Hoover was substantially involved in most major cases and projects that the FBI handled during his tenure. But as detailed below, his tenure as Bureau director proved to be highly controversial, especially in its later years. After Hoover&#x27;s death, Congress passed legislation that limited the tenure of future FBI directors to ten years.

Early homicide investigations of the new agency included the Osage Indian murders. During the &quot;War on Crime&quot; of the 1930s, FBI agents apprehended or killed a number of notorious criminals who committed kidnappings, bank robberies, and murders throughout the nation, including John Dillinger, &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson, Kate &quot;Ma&quot; Barker, Alvin &quot;Creepy&quot; Karpis, and George &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Kelly.

Other activities of its early decades focused on the scope and influence of the white supremacist group Ku Klux Klan, a group with which the FBI was evidenced to be working in the Viola Liuzzo lynching case. Earlier, through the work of Edwin Atherton, the BOI claimed to have successfully apprehended an entire army of Mexican neo-revolutionaries under the leadership of General Enrique Estrada in the mid-1920s, east of San Diego, California.

Hoover began using wiretapping in the 1920s during Prohibition to arrest bootleggers. In the 1927 case &quot;Olmstead v. United States&quot;, in which a bootlegger was caught through telephone tapping, the United States Supreme Court ruled that FBI wiretaps did not violate the Fourth Amendment as unlawful search and seizure, as long as the FBI did not break into a person&#x27;s home to complete the tapping. After Prohibition&#x27;s repeal, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934, which outlawed non-consensual phone tapping, but did allow bugging. In the 1939 case &quot;Nardone v. United States&quot;, the court ruled that due to the 1934 law, evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court. After &quot;Katz v. United States&quot; (1967) overturned &quot;Olmstead&quot;, Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control Act, allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations, as long as they obtained warrants beforehand.

==== National security ====
Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s, the bureau investigated cases of espionage against the United States and its allies. Eight Nazi agents who had planned sabotage operations against American targets were arrested, and six were executed (&quot;Ex parte Quirin&quot;) under their sentences. Also during this time, a joint US/UK code-breaking effort called &quot;The Venona Project&quot;—with which the FBI was heavily involved—broke Soviet diplomatic and intelligence communications codes, allowing the US and British governments to read Soviet communications. This effort confirmed the existence of Americans working in the United States for Soviet intelligence. Hoover was administering this project, but he failed to notify the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of it until 1952. Another notable case was the arrest of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1957. The discovery of Soviet spies operating in the US motivated Hoover to pursue his longstanding concern with the threat he perceived from the American Left.

==== Japanese American internment ====
In 1939, the Bureau began compiling a custodial detention list with the names of those who would be taken into custody in the event of war with Axis nations. The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the FBI Index list. Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Mass arrests and searches of homes, in most cases conducted without warrants, began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody. 

On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. FBI Director Hoover opposed the subsequent mass removal and confinement of Japanese Americans authorized under Executive Order 9066, but Roosevelt prevailed. The vast majority went along with the subsequent exclusion orders, but in a handful of cases where Japanese Americans refused to obey the new military regulations, FBI agents handled their arrests. The Bureau continued surveillance on Japanese Americans throughout the war, conducting background checks on applicants for resettlement outside camp, and entering the camps, usually without the permission of War Relocation Authority officials, and grooming informants to monitor dissidents and &quot;troublemakers&quot;. After the war, the FBI was assigned to protect returning Japanese Americans from attacks by hostile white communities.

==== Sex deviates program ====
According to Douglas M. Charles, the FBI&#x27;s &quot;sex deviates&quot; program began on April 10, 1950, when J. Edgar Hoover forwarded to the White House, to the U.S. Civil Service Commission, and to branches of the armed services a list of 393 alleged federal employees who had allegedly been arrested in Washington, D.C., since 1947, on charges of &quot;sexual irregularities&quot;. On June 20, 1951, Hoover expanded the program by issuing a memo establishing a &quot;uniform policy for the handling of the increasing number of reports and allegations concerning present and past employees of the United States Government who assertedly [sic] are sex deviates&quot;. The program was expanded to include non-government jobs. According to Athan Theoharis, &quot;In 1951 he [Hoover] had unilaterally instituted a Sex Deviates program to purge alleged homosexuals from any position in the federal government, from the lowliest clerk to the more powerful position of White house aide.&quot; On May 27, 1953, Executive Order 10450 went into effect. The program was expanded further by this executive order by making all federal employment of homosexuals illegal. On July 8, 1953, the FBI forwarded to the U.S. Civil Service Commission information from the sex deviates program. Between 1977 and 1978, 300,000 pages in the sex deviates program, collected between 1930 and the mid-1970s, were destroyed by FBI officials.

==== Civil rights movement ====
During the 1950s and 1960s, FBI officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders, whom they believed either had communist ties or were unduly influenced by communists or &quot;fellow travelers&quot;. In 1956, for example, Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr. T. R. M. Howard, a civil rights leader, surgeon, and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of George W. Lee, Emmett Till, and other blacks in the South. The FBI carried out controversial domestic surveillance in an operation it called the COINTELPRO, from &quot;COunter-INTELligence PROgram&quot;. It was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the United States, including both militant and non-violent organizations. Among its targets was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a leading civil rights organization whose clergy leadership included the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..
The FBI frequently investigated King. In the mid-1960s, King began to criticize the Bureau for giving insufficient attention to the use of terrorism by white supremacists. Hoover responded by publicly calling King the most &quot;notorious liar&quot; in the United States. In his 1991 memoir, &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist Carl Rowan asserted that the FBI had sent at least one anonymous letter to King encouraging him to commit suicide. Historian Taylor Branch documents an anonymous November 1964 &quot;suicide package&quot; sent by the Bureau that combined a letter to the civil rights leader telling him &quot;You are done. There is only one way out for you.&quot; with audio recordings of King&#x27;s sexual indiscretions.

In March 1971, the residential office of an FBI agent in Media, Pennsylvania, was burgled by a group calling itself the Citizens&#x27; Commission to Investigate the FBI. Numerous files were taken and distributed to a range of newspapers, including &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. The files detailed the FBI&#x27;s extensive COINTELPRO program, which included investigations into lives of ordinary citizens—including a black student group at a Pennsylvania military college and the daughter of Congressman Henry S. Reuss of Wisconsin. The country was &quot;jolted&quot; by the revelations, which included assassinations of political activists, and the actions were denounced by members of the Congress, including House Majority Leader Hale Boggs. The phones of some members of the Congress, including Boggs, had allegedly been tapped.

==== Kennedy&#x27;s assassination ====
When President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed, the jurisdiction fell to the local police departments until President Lyndon B. Johnson directed the FBI to take over the investigation. To ensure clarity about the responsibility for investigation of homicides of federal officials, Congress passed a law in 1965 that included investigations of such deaths of federal officials, especially by homicide, within FBI jurisdiction.

=== Organized crime ===

In response to organized crime, on August 25, 1953, the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program. The national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to Washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers. After the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, for RICO Act, took effect, the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition-organized groups, which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns. All the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations, using the provisions provided in the RICO Act. Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups. Although Hoover initially denied the existence of a National Crime Syndicate in the United States, the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families, including those headed by Sam Giancana and John Gotti. The RICO Act is still used today for all organized crime and any individuals who may fall under the Act&#x27;s provisions.

In 2003, a congressional committee called the FBI&#x27;s organized crime informant program &quot;one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement&quot;. The FBI allowed four innocent men to be convicted of the March 1965 gangland murder of Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Deegan in order to protect Vincent Flemmi, an FBI informant. Three of the men were sentenced to death (which was later reduced to life in prison), and the fourth defendant was sentenced to life in prison. Two of the four men died in prison after serving almost 30 years, and two others were released after serving 32 and 36 years. In July 2007, U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner in Boston found that the Bureau had helped convict the four men using false witness accounts given by mobster Joseph Barboza. The U.S. Government was ordered to pay $100 million in damages to the four defendants.

=== Special FBI teams ===

In 1982, the FBI formed an elite unit to help with problems that might arise at the 1984 Summer Olympics to be held in Los Angeles, particularly terrorism and major-crime. This was a result of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, when terrorists murdered the Israeli athletes. Named the Hostage Rescue Team, or HRT, it acts as a dedicated FBI SWAT team dealing primarily with counter-terrorism scenarios. Unlike the special agents serving on local FBI SWAT teams, HRT does not conduct investigations. Instead, HRT focuses solely on additional tactical proficiency and capabilities. Also formed in 1984 was the &quot;Computer Analysis and Response Team&quot;, or CART.

From the end of the 1980s to the early 1990s, the FBI reassigned more than 300 agents from foreign counter-intelligence duties to violent crime, and made violent crime the sixth national priority. With cuts to other well-established departments, and because terrorism was no longer considered a threat after the end of the Cold War, the FBI assisted local and state police forces in tracking fugitives who had crossed state lines, which is a federal offense. The FBI Laboratory helped develop DNA testing, continuing its pioneering role in identification that began with its fingerprinting system in 1924.

=== Notable efforts in the 1990s ===

On May 1, 1992, FBI SWAT and HRT personnel in Los Angeles County, California aided local officials in securing peace within the area during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. HRT operators, for instance, spent 10 days conducting vehicle-mounted patrols throughout Los Angeles, before returning to Virginia.

Between 1993 and 1996, the FBI increased its counter-terrorism role following the first 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and the arrest of the Unabomber in 1996. Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted. However, Justice Department investigations into the FBI&#x27;s roles in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents were found to have been obstructed by agents within the Bureau. During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing. It has settled a dispute with Richard Jewell, who was a private security guard at the venue, along with some media organizations, in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation; this had briefly led to his being wrongly suspected of the bombing.

After Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, 1994), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, 1996), and the Economic Espionage Act (EEA, 1996), the FBI followed suit and underwent a technological upgrade in 1998, just as it did with its CART team in 1991. Computer Investigations and Infrastructure Threat Assessment Center (CITAC) and the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) were created to deal with the increase in Internet-related problems, such as computer viruses, worms, and other malicious programs that threatened U.S. operations. With these developments, the FBI increased its electronic surveillance in public safety and national security investigations, adapting to the telecommunications advancements that changed the nature of such problems.

=== September 11 attacks ===

During the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center, FBI agent Leonard W. Hatton Jr. was killed during the rescue effort while helping the rescue personnel evacuate the occupants of the South Tower, and he stayed when it collapsed. Within months after the attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller, who had been sworn in a week before the attacks, called for a re-engineering of FBI structure and operations. He made countering every federal crime a top priority, including the prevention of terrorism, countering foreign intelligence operations, addressing cybersecurity threats, other high-tech crimes, protecting civil rights, combating public corruption, organized crime, white-collar crime, and major acts of violent crime.

In February 2001, Robert Hanssen was caught selling information to the Russian government. It was later learned that Hanssen, who had reached a high position within the FBI, had been selling intelligence since as early as 1979. He pleaded guilty to espionage and received a life sentence in 2002, but the incident led many to question the security practices employed by the FBI. There was also a claim that Hanssen might have contributed information that led to the September 11, 2001, attacks.

The 9/11 Commission&#x27;s final report on July 22, 2004, stated that the FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were both partially to blame for not pursuing intelligence reports that could have prevented the September 11 attacks. In its most damning assessment, the report concluded that the country had &quot;not been well served&quot; by either agency and listed numerous recommendations for changes within the FBI. While the FBI did accede to most of the recommendations, including oversight by the new director of National Intelligence, some former members of the 9/11 Commission publicly criticized the FBI in October 2005, claiming it was resisting any meaningful changes.

On July 8, 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published excerpts from UCLA Professor Amy Zegart&#x27;s book &quot;Spying Blind: The CIA, the FBI, and the Origins of 9/11&quot;. The &quot;Post&quot; reported, from Zegart&#x27;s book, that government documents showed that both the CIA and the FBI had missed 23 potential chances to disrupt the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The primary reasons for the failures included: agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas; inappropriate incentives for promotion; and a lack of cooperation between the FBI, CIA, and the rest of the United States Intelligence Community. The book blamed the FBI&#x27;s decentralized structure, which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices. The book suggested that the FBI had not evolved into an effective counter-terrorism or counter-intelligence agency, due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change. For example, FBI personnel practices continued to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff, classifying intelligence analysts alongside the FBI&#x27;s auto mechanics and janitors.

=== Faulty bullet analysis ===
For over 40 years, the FBI crime lab in Quantico had believed that lead alloys used in bullets had unique chemical signatures. It was analyzing the bullets with the goal of matching them chemically, not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory, but also to a single box of bullets. The National Academy of Sciences conducted an 18-month independent review of comparative bullet-lead analysis. In 2003, its National Research Council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of FBI testimony. It found the analytic model used by the FBI for interpreting results was deeply flawed, and the conclusion, that bullet fragments could be matched to a box of ammunition, was so overstated that it was misleading under the rules of evidence. One year later, the FBI decided to stop conducting bullet lead analyses.

After a &quot;60 Minutes&quot;/&quot;The Washington Post&quot; investigation in November 2007, two years later, the Bureau agreed to identify, review, and release all pertinent cases, and notify prosecutors about cases in which faulty testimony was given.

=== Technology ===
In 2012, the FBI formed the National Domestic Communications Assistance Center to develop technology for assisting law enforcement with technical knowledge regarding communication services, technologies, and electronic surveillance.

=== January 6 United States Capitol attack ===
An FBI informant who participated in the January 6 United States Capitol attack on democratic institutions in Washington D.C. later testified in support of the Proud boys, who were part of the plot. Revelations about the informant raised fresh questions about intelligence failures by the FBI before the riot. According to the Brennan Center, and Senate committees, the FBI&#x27;s response to white supremacist violence was &quot;woefully inadequate&quot;. The FBI has long been suspected to have turned a blind eye towards right-wing extremists while disseminating &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; on the origin of SARS-CoV-2.

== Organization ==
=== Organizational structure ===


The FBI is organized into functional branches and the Office of the Director, which contains most administrative offices. An executive assistant director manages each branch. Each branch is then divided into offices and divisions, each headed by an assistant director. The various divisions are further divided into sub-branches, led by deputy assistant directors. Within these sub-branches, there are various sections headed by section chiefs. Section chiefs are ranked analogous to special agents in charge. Four of the branches report to the deputy director while two report to the associate director.

The main branches of the FBI are:
*FBI Intelligence Branch
**Executive Assistant Director: Stephen Laycock
*FBI National Security Branch

== Legal authority ==
The FBI&#x27;s mandate is established in Title 28 of the United States Code (U.S. Code), Section 533, which authorizes the Attorney General to &quot;appoint officials to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States&quot;. Other federal statutes give the FBI the authority and responsibility to investigate specific crimes.

The FBI&#x27;s chief tool against organized crime is the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. The FBI is also charged with the responsibility of enforcing compliance of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964 and investigating violations of the act in addition to prosecuting such violations with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). The FBI also shares concurrent jurisdiction with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.

The USA PATRIOT Act increased the powers allotted to the FBI, especially in wiretapping and monitoring of Internet activity. One of the most controversial provisions of the act is the so-called &quot;sneak and peek&quot; provision, granting the FBI powers to search a house while the residents are away, and not requiring them to notify the residents for several weeks afterward. Under the PATRIOT Act&#x27;s provisions, the FBI also resumed inquiring into the library records of those who are suspected of terrorism (something it had supposedly not done since the 1970s).

In the early 1980s, Senate hearings were held to examine FBI undercover operations in the wake of the Abscam controversy, which had allegations of entrapment of elected officials. As a result, in the following years a number of guidelines were issued to constrain FBI activities.

Information obtained through an FBI investigation is presented to the appropriate U.S. Attorney or Department of Justice official, who decides if prosecution or other action is warranted.

The FBI often works in conjunction with other federal agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in seaport and airport security, and the National Transportation Safety Board in investigating airplane crashes and other critical incidents. Immigration and Customs Enforcement&#x27;s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) has nearly the same amount of investigative manpower as the FBI and investigates the largest range of crimes. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, then–Attorney General Ashcroft assigned the FBI as the designated lead organization in terrorism investigations after the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. HSI and the FBI are both integral members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

=== Indian reservations ===
The federal government has the primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting serious crime on Indian reservations.

The FBI does not specifically list crimes in Native American land as one of its priorities. Often serious crimes have been either poorly investigated or prosecution has been declined. Tribal courts can impose sentences of up to three years, under certain restrictions.

== Infrastructure ==

The FBI is headquartered at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., with 56 field offices in major cities across the United States. The FBI also maintains over 400 resident agencies across the United States, as well as over 50 legal attachés at United States embassies and consulates. Many specialized FBI functions are located at facilities in Quantico, Virginia, as well as a &quot;data campus&quot; in Clarksburg, West Virginia, where 96 million sets of fingerprints &quot;from across the United States are stored, along with others collected by American authorities from prisoners in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan&quot;. The FBI is in process of moving its Records Management Division, which processes Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, to Winchester, Virginia.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the FBI &quot;is building a vast repository controlled by people who work in a top-secret vault on the fourth floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington. This one stores the profiles of tens of thousands of Americans and legal residents who are not accused of any crime. What they have done is appear to be acting suspiciously to a town sheriff, a traffic cop or even a neighbor.&quot;

The FBI Laboratory, established with the formation of the BOI, did not appear in the J. Edgar Hoover Building until its completion in 1974. The lab serves as the primary lab for most DNA, biological, and physical work. Public tours of FBI headquarters ran through the FBI laboratory workspace before the move to the J. Edgar Hoover Building. The services the lab conducts include &quot;Chemistry&quot;, &quot;Combined DNA Index System&quot; (CODIS), &quot;Computer Analysis and Response&quot;, &quot;DNA Analysis&quot;, &quot;Evidence Response&quot;, &quot;Explosives&quot;, &quot;Firearms and Tool marks&quot;, &quot;Forensic Audio&quot;, &quot;Forensic Video&quot;, &quot;Image Analysis&quot;, &quot;Forensic Science Research&quot;, &quot;Forensic Science Training&quot;, &quot;Hazardous Materials Response&quot;, &quot;Investigative and Prospective Graphics&quot;, &quot;Latent Prints&quot;, &quot;Materials Analysis&quot;, &quot;Questioned Documents&quot;, &quot;Racketeering Records&quot;, &quot;Special Photographic Analysis&quot;, &quot;Structural Design&quot;, and &quot;Trace Evidence&quot;. The services of the FBI Laboratory are used by many state, local, and international agencies free of charge. The lab also maintains a second lab at the FBI Academy.

The FBI Academy, located in Quantico, Virginia, is home to the communications and computer laboratory the FBI utilizes. It is also where new agents are sent for training to become FBI special agents. Going through the 21-week course is required for every special agent. First opened for use in 1972, the facility is located on of woodland. The Academy trains state and local law enforcement agencies, which are invited to the law enforcement training center. The FBI units that reside at Quantico are the &quot;Field and Police Training Unit&quot;, &quot;Firearms Training Unit&quot;, &quot;Forensic Science Research and Training Center&quot;, &quot;Technology Services Unit&quot; (TSU), &quot;Investigative Training Unit&quot;, &quot;Law Enforcement Communication Unit&quot;, &quot;Leadership and Management Science Units&quot; (LSMU), &quot;Physical Training Unit&quot;, &quot;New Agents&#x27; Training Unit&quot; (NATU), &quot;Practical Applications Unit&quot; (PAU), the &quot;Investigative Computer Training Unit&quot; and the &quot;College of Analytical Studies&quot;.
In 2000, the FBI began the Trilogy project to upgrade its outdated information technology (IT) infrastructure. This project, originally scheduled to take three years and cost around $380 million, ended up over budget and behind schedule. Efforts to deploy modern computers and networking equipment were generally successful, but attempts to develop new investigation software, outsourced to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), were not. Virtual Case File, or VCF, as the software was known, was plagued by poorly defined goals, and repeated changes in management. 

In January 2005, more than two years after the software was originally planned for completion, the FBI abandoned the project. At least $100 million, and much more by some estimates, was spent on the project, which never became operational. The FBI has been forced to continue using its decade-old Automated Case Support system, which IT experts consider woefully inadequate. In March 2005, the FBI announced it was beginning a new, more ambitious software project, code-named Sentinel, which they expected to complete by 2009.
Carnivore was an electronic eavesdropping software system implemented by the FBI during the Clinton administration; it was designed to monitor email and electronic communications. After prolonged negative coverage in the press, the FBI changed the name of its system from &quot;Carnivore&quot; to &quot;DCS1000&quot;. DCS is reported to stand for &quot;Digital Collection System&quot;; the system has the same functions as before. The Associated Press reported in mid-January 2005 that the FBI essentially abandoned the use of Carnivore in 2001, in favor of commercially available software, such as NarusInsight.

The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division is located in Clarksburg, West Virginia. Organized beginning in 1991, the office opened in 1995 as the youngest agency division. The complex is the length of three football fields. It provides a main repository for information in various data systems. Under the roof of the CJIS are the programs for the &quot;National Crime Information Center&quot; (NCIC), &quot;Uniform Crime Reporting&quot; (UCR), &quot;Fingerprint Identification&quot;, &quot;Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System&quot; (IAFIS), &quot;NCIC 2000&quot;, and the &quot;National Incident-Based Reporting System&quot; (NIBRS). Many state and local agencies use these data systems as a source for their own investigations and contribute to the database using secure communications. FBI provides these tools of sophisticated identification and information services to local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies.

The FBI heads the National Virtual Translation Center, which provides &quot;timely and accurate translations of foreign intelligence for all elements of the Intelligence Community&quot;.

In June 2021, the FBI held a groundbreaking for its planned FBI Innovation Center, set to be built in Huntsville, Alabama. The Innovation Center is to be part of a large, college-like campus costing a total of $1.3 billion in Redstone Arsenal and will act as a center for cyber threat intelligence, data analytics, and emerging threat training.

== Personnel ==

, the FBI had a total of 33,852 employees. That includes 13,412 special agents and 20,420 support professionals, such as intelligence analysts, language specialists, scientists, information technology specialists, and other professionals.

The Officer Down Memorial Page provides the biographies of 86 FBI agents who have died in the line of duty from 1925 to February 2021.

=== Hiring process ===
To apply to become an FBI agent, one must be between the ages of 23 and 37, unless one is a preference-eligible veteran, in which case one may apply after age 37. The applicant must also hold U.S. citizenship, be of high moral character, have a clean record, and hold at least a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree. At least three years of professional work experience prior to application is also required. All FBI employees require a Top Secret (TS) security clearance, and in many instances, employees need a TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information) clearance. 

To obtain a security clearance, all potential FBI personnel must pass a series of Single Scope Background Investigations (SSBI), which are conducted by the Office of Personnel Management. Special agent candidates also have to pass a Physical Fitness Test (PFT), which includes a 300-meter run, one-minute sit-ups, maximum push-ups, and a run. Personnel must pass a polygraph test with questions including possible drug use. Applicants who fail polygraphs may not gain employment with the FBI. Up until 1975, the FBI had a minimum height requirement of .

=== BOI and FBI directors ===
FBI directors are appointed (nominated) by the president of the United States and must be confirmed by the United States Senate to serve a term of office of ten years, subject to resignation or removal by the president at his/her discretion before their term ends. Additional terms are allowed following the same procedure.

J. Edgar Hoover, appointed by President Calvin Coolidge in 1924, was by far the longest-serving director, serving until his death in 1972. In 1968, Congress passed legislation, as part of the &quot;Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968&quot;, requiring Senate confirmation of appointments of future directors. As the incumbent, this legislation did not apply to Hoover. The last FBI director was Andrew McCabe. The current FBI director is Christopher A. Wray, appointed by President Donald Trump. He has indicated that he intends to resign before the change of administrations although it is prior to his term of office.

The FBI director is responsible for the day-to-day operations at the FBI. Along with the deputy director, the director makes sure cases and operations are handled correctly. The director also is in charge of making sure the leadership in the FBI field offices is staffed with qualified agents. Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act was passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the FBI director would directly brief the president of the United States on any issues that arise from within the FBI. Since then, the director now reports to the director of national intelligence (DNI), who in turn reports to the President.

== Firearms ==
Upon qualification, an FBI special agent is issued a full-size Glock 22 or compact Glock 23 semi-automatic pistol, both of which are chambered in the .40 S&amp;W cartridge. In May 1997, the FBI officially adopted the Glock, in .40 S&amp;W, for general agent use, and first issued it to New Agent Class 98-1 in October 1997. At present, the Glock 23 &quot;FG&amp;R&quot; (finger groove and rail; either 3rd generation or &quot;Gen4&quot;) is the issue sidearm. 

New agents are issued firearms, on which they must qualify, on successful completion of their training at the FBI Academy. The Glock 26 (subcompact 9 mm Parabellum), Glock 23 and Glock 27 (.40 S&amp;W compact and subcompact, respectively) are authorized as secondary weapons. Special agents are also authorized to purchase and qualify with the Glock 21 in .45 ACP.

Special agents of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) and regional SWAT teams are issued the Springfield Armory Professional Model 1911 pistol in .45 ACP.

In June 2016, the FBI awarded Glock a contract for new handguns. Unlike the currently issued .40 S&amp;W chambered Glock pistols, the new Glocks will be chambered for 9 mm Parabellum. The contract is for the full-size Glock 17M and the compact Glock 19M. The &quot;M&quot; means the Glocks have been modified to meet government standards specified by a 2015 government request for proposal.

== Publications ==

The &quot;FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin&quot; is published monthly by the FBI Law Enforcement Communication Unit, with articles of interest to state and local law enforcement personnel. First published in 1932 as &quot;Fugitives Wanted by Police&quot;, the &quot;FBI Law Bulletin&quot; covers topics including law enforcement technology and issues, such as crime mapping and use of force, as well as recent criminal justice research, and ViCAP alerts, on wanted suspects and key cases.

The FBI also publishes some reports for both law enforcement personnel as well as regular citizens covering topics including law enforcement, terrorism, cybercrime, white-collar crime, violent crime, and statistics. The vast majority of federal government publications covering these topics are published by the Office of Justice Programs agencies of the United States Department of Justice, and disseminated through the National Criminal Justice Reference Service.

=== Crime statistics ===
During the 1920s the FBI began issuing crime reports by gathering numbers from local police departments. Due to limitations of this system that were discovered during the 1960s and 1970s—victims often simply did not report crimes to the police in the first place—the Department of Justice developed an alternative method of tallying crime, the victimization survey.

==== Uniform Crime Reports ====

The Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) compile data from over 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the country. They provide detailed data regarding the volume of crimes to include arrest, clearance (or closing a case), and law enforcement officer information. The UCR focuses its data collection on violent crimes, hate crimes, and property crimes. Created in the 1920s, the UCR system has not proven to be as &quot;uniform&quot; as its name implies. The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape. Since about 93% of the data submitted to the FBI is in this format, the UCR stands out as the publication of choice as most states require law enforcement agencies to submit this data.

Preliminary Annual &quot;Uniform Crime Report&quot; for 2006 was released on June 4, 2006. The report shows violent crime offenses rose 1.3%, but the number of property crime offenses decreased 2.9% compared to 2005.

==== National Incident-Based Reporting System ====

The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data. The system is used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes. Local, state, and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems. Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category. The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories. Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system. In addition to the Group A offenses, eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information. The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system. , 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data. That amount represents 20% of the United States population and 16% of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI.

== eGuardian ==
eGuardian is the name of an FBI system, launched in January 2009, to share tips about possible terror threats with local police agencies. The program aims to get law enforcement at all levels sharing data quickly about suspicious activity and people.

eGuardian enables near real-time sharing and tracking of terror information and suspicious activities with local, state, tribal, and federal agencies. The eGuardian system is a spin-off of a similar but classified tool called Guardian that has been used inside the FBI, and shared with vetted partners since 2005.

== Controversies ==
Throughout its history, the FBI has been the subject of many controversies, both at home and abroad.

*Files on Puerto Rican independence advocates – Congressman Luiz Gutierrez revealed that Pedro Albizu Campos and his Nationalist political party had been watched for a decade-long period in the 1930s.
*The Whitey Bulger case – The FBI was, and continues to be, criticized for its handling of Boston criminal Whitey Bulger. As a result of Bulger acting as an informant, the agency turned a blind eye to his activities as an exchange.
*Latin America – For decades during the Cold War, the FBI placed agents to monitor the governments of Caribbean and Latin American nations.
*Domestic surveillance – In 1985, it was found that the FBI had made use of surveillance devices on numerous American citizens between 1940 and 1960.
*Robert Hanssen – In what is described by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) as &quot;possibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S. history&quot;. Hanssen managed to evade the FBI as he simultaneously sold thousands of classified American documents to Soviet intelligence operatives.
*Viola Liuzzo – Gary Thomas Rowe, an FBI informant who at the time was also an active member of the Ku Klux Klan, assisted in the murder of Viola Liuzzo (a civil rights activist) in 1965, and afterwards, defamatory rumors were spread by the Bureau about the victim.
*Ruby Ridge (1992) was a shootout between the FBI and Randy Weaver over his failure to appear for weapons charges.
*Waco siege (1993) was a failed raid by the ATF that resulted in the death of 4 ATF agents and 6 Branch Davidians. The FBI and US military got involved with the 51 day siege that followed. The building ended up burning down killing 76 including 26 children. This is what motivated Timothy McVeigh (along with Ruby Ridge) to carry out the Oklahoma City bombing (1995).
*Associated Press (AP) impersonation case – A Bureau agent, masquerading as an AP journalist, placed surveillance software in the personal computer of a minor. This resulted in a series of conflicts between the news agency and the FBI.
*Stoneman Douglas High School shooting – A statement from the FBI confirmed that it had failed to act on a tip warning of the possibility of the shooting over a month prior to its occurrence, which may have prevented the tragedy outright.
*1993 World Trade Center bombing - Emad Salem, an FBI informant and a key witness in the trial of Ramzi Yousef, Abdul Hakim Murad, and Wali Khan Amin Shah, stated that the bomb itself was built under supervision from the FBI.

Specific practices include:

*Internal investigations of shootings – A professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha suggested that FBI internal reports found a questionably high number of weapon discharges by its agents to be justified.
*Covert operations on political groups – Political groups deemed disruptive have been investigated and discredited by the FBI in the aim of &quot;protecting national security, preventing violence, and maintaining the existing social and political order&quot;.
*FBI surveillance since 2010 – In the years since 2010, it has been uncovered by various civil liberties groups (such as the American Civil Liberties Union [ACLU]) that the FBI earmarked disproportionate resources for the surveillance of left-leaning movements and political organizations. The FBI has also committed several breaches of the First Amendment in this time.
*Files on U.S. citizens – The Bureau kept files on certain individuals for varying reasons and lengths of time, notably, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, John Denver.
*Entrapment - The FBI has been criticized for its use of entrapment, where &quot;agent provocateurs&quot; attempt to incite individuals into committing illegal acts. Notable critics of FBI entrapment such as Human Rights Watch and the ACLU note that entrapment cases often target impoverished individuals or those with mental or emotional disabilities and that these cases have an adverse effect on marginalized groups.

== Media portrayal ==
The FBI has been frequently depicted in popular media since the 1930s. The bureau has participated to varying degrees, which has ranged from direct involvement in the creative process of film or TV series development, to providing consultation on operations and closed cases. A few of the notable portrayals of the FBI on television are the series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, which started in 1993 and concluded its eleventh season in early 2018, and concerned investigations into paranormal phenomena by five fictional special agents, and the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) agency in the TV drama &quot;24&quot;, which is patterned after the FBI Counterterrorism Division. 

The 1991 movie &quot;Point Break&quot; depicts an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated a gang of bank robbers. The 1997 movie &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; is based on the true story of undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone infiltrating the Mafia. The 2005–2020 television series &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, that follows the team members of the FBI&#x27;s Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) in the pursuit of serial killers. The 2017 TV series Riverdale where one of the main characters is an FBI agent. The 2015 TV series &quot;Quantico&quot;, titled after the location of the Bureau&#x27;s training facility, deals with probationary and special agents, not all of whom, within the show&#x27;s format, may be fully reliable or even trustworthy. 

The 2018 series &quot;FBI&quot;, set in NYC that follows the personal and professional lives of the agents assigned to 26 Federal Plaza (NYC FBI field office). &quot;FBI&quot; first spin-off titled &quot;&quot; (2019), follows the FBI&#x27;s Fugitive Task Force in chasing down the US&#x27;s most wanted criminals, and the second spin-off, &quot;&quot; (2021), follows the FBI&#x27;s International Fly Team that goes where ever they are needed in the world to protect the US&#x27;s interests.

<text>A Flamsteed designation is a combination of a number and constellation name that uniquely identifies most naked eye stars in the modern constellations visible from southern England. They are named for John Flamsteed who first used them while compiling his &quot;Historia Coelestis Britannica&quot;. (Flamsteed used a telescope, and the catalog also includes some stars which are relatively bright but not necessarily visible with the naked eye.)

==Description==

Flamsteed designations for stars are similar to Bayer designations, except that they use numbers instead of Greek and Roman letters. Each star is assigned a number and the Latin genitive of the constellation it lies in (see 88 modern constellations for a list of constellations and the genitive forms of their names). Flamsteed designations were assigned to 2554 stars. The numbers were originally assigned in order of increasing right ascension within each constellation, but due to the effects of precession they are now slightly out of order in some places.

This method of designating stars first appeared in a preliminary version of John Flamsteed&#x27;s &quot;Historia Coelestis Britannica&quot; published by Edmond Halley and Isaac Newton in 1712 without Flamsteed&#x27;s approval. The final version of Flamsteed&#x27;s catalogue published in 1725 after his death omitted the numerical designations altogether. The numbers now in use were assigned by the French astronomer, Joseph Jérôme de Lalande and appeared in his 1783 almanac, &quot;Éphémérides des mouvemens célestes&quot; which contained a revised edition of Flamsteed&#x27;s catalogue. Lalande noted in his Introduction that he got the idea from the unofficial 1712 edition.

Flamsteed designations gained popularity throughout the eighteenth century, and are now commonly used when no Bayer designation exists. Where a Bayer designation with a Greek letter does exist for a star, it is usually used in preference to the Flamsteed designation. (Flamsteed numbers are generally preferred to Bayer designations with &quot;Roman&quot; letters.) Examples of well-known stars that are usually referred to by their Flamsteed numbers include 51 Pegasi, and 61 Cygni. Flamsteed designations are often used instead of the Bayer designation if the latter contains an extra attached number; for example, &quot;55 Cancri&quot; is more common than &quot;Rho1 Cancri&quot;.

There are examples of stars, such as 10 Ursae Majoris in Lynx, bearing Flamsteed designations for constellations in which they do not lie, just as there are for Bayer designations, because of the compromises that had to be made when the modern constellation boundaries were drawn up.

Flamsteed&#x27;s catalogue covered only the stars visible from Great Britain, and therefore stars of the far southern constellations have no Flamsteed numbers. Some stars, such as the nearby star 82 Eridani, were named in a major southern-hemisphere catalog called &quot;Uranometria Argentina&quot;, by Benjamin Gould; these are Gould numbers, rather than Flamsteed numbers, and should be differentiated with a G, as in 82 G. Eridani. Except for a handful of cases, Gould numbers are not in common use. Similarly, Flamsteed-like designations assigned by other astronomers (for example, Hevelius) are no longer in general use. (A well-known exception is the globular cluster 47 Tucanae from Bode&#x27;s catalog.)

84 stars entered in Flamsteed&#x27;s catalog are errors and proved not to exist in the sky: All of them except 11 Vulpeculae were plotted on his star charts.
* Flamsteed observed Uranus in 1690 but did not recognize it as a planet and entered it into his catalog as a star called &quot;34 Tauri&quot;.
* 11 Vulpeculae was a nova, now known as CK Vulpeculae.
* Many of them were caused by arithmetic errors made by Flamsteed.

==List of constellations using Flamsteed star designations==
There are 52 constellations that primarily use Flamsteed designations. Stars are listed in the appropriate lists for the constellation, as follows:

In addition, several stars in Puppis, and a small number of stars in Centaurus and Lupus, have been given Flamsteed designations.

<text>The Northrop F-5 is a family of supersonic light fighter aircraft initially designed as a privately funded project in the late 1950s by Northrop Corporation. There are two main models: the original F-5A and F-5B Freedom Fighter variants, and the extensively updated F-5E and F-5F Tiger II variants. The design team wrapped a small, highly aerodynamic fighter around two compact and high-thrust General Electric J85 engines, focusing on performance and a low cost of maintenance. Smaller and simpler than contemporaries such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, the F-5 costs less to procure and operate, making it a popular export aircraft. Though primarily designed for a day air superiority role, the aircraft is also a capable ground-attack platform. The F-5A entered service in the early 1960s. During the Cold War, over 800 were produced through 1972 for US allies. Despite the United States Air Force (USAF) not needing a light fighter at the time, it did procure approximately 1,200 Northrop T-38 Talon trainer aircraft, which were based on Northrop&#x27;s N-156 fighter design.

After winning the International Fighter Aircraft Competition, a program aimed at providing effective low-cost fighters to American allies, in 1972 Northrop introduced the second-generation F-5E Tiger II. This upgrade included more powerful engines, larger fuel capacity, greater wing area and improved leading-edge extensions for better turn rates, optional air-to-air refueling, and improved avionics, including air-to-air radar. Primarily used by American allies, it remains in US service to support training exercises. It has served in a wide array of roles, being able to perform both air and ground attack duties; the type was used extensively in the Vietnam War. A total of 1,400 Tiger IIs were built before production ended in 1987. More than 3,800 F-5s and the closely related T-38 advanced trainer aircraft were produced in Hawthorne, California. The F-5N/F variants are in service with the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps as adversary trainers. Over 400 aircraft were in service as of 2021.

The F-5 was also developed into a dedicated reconnaissance aircraft, the RF-5 Tigereye. The F-5 also served as a starting point for a series of design studies which resulted in the Northrop YF-17 and the F/A-18 naval fighter aircraft. The Northrop F-20 Tigershark was an advanced variant to succeed the F-5E which was ultimately canceled when export customers did not emerge.

==Design and development==

===Origins===
The design effort was led by Northrop vice president of engineering and aircraft designer Edgar Schmued, who previously at North American Aviation had been the chief designer of the successful North American P-51 Mustang and F-86 Sabre fighters. Schmued recruited a strong engineering team to Northrop.

In December 1953, NATO issued NBMR-1, calling for a lightweight tactical fighter capable of carrying conventional and nuclear weapons and operating from rough airfields. In late 1954, a Northrop team toured Europe and Asia to examine both the NBMR-1 and the needs of SEATO members. From this tour, Schmued gave his team the goal of reversing the trend in fighter development towards greater size and weight in order to deliver an aircraft with high performance, enhanced maneuverability, and high reliability, while still delivering a cost advantage over contemporary fighters. Recognizing that expensive jet aircraft could not viably be replaced every few years, he also demanded &quot;engineered growth potential&quot; allowing service longevity in excess of 10 years.

The design began to firm up in 1955 with the introduction of the General Electric J85 turbojet engine. Originally developed for McDonnell&#x27;s ADM-20 Quail decoy for use on the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, the J85 had a thrust-to-weight ratio of 6.25 to 7.5 depending on the version, giving it a notable advantage over contemporaries such as the 4.7 ratio of the J79 engine used in the F-4 Phantom.

===Design evolution===
Using a pair of J85s as the baseline, the team began considering a series of prospective designs. Among the earliest concepts was the N-156TX of March 1955. This mounted the engines in pods, one under each wing about mid-span. The fuselage was quite slim compared to the final design, with a crew of two under a narrow cockpit canopy.

That year, the US Navy expressed an interest in a fighter to operate from its escort carriers, which were too small to operate the Navy&#x27;s existing jet fighters. Northrop responded with a radical redesign, PD-2706, which placed the engines against the fuselage in short ducts exiting in front of the tail area, like the F-4, and moved the elevator up to form a T-tail. The resulting design had a much shorter fuselage and was quite compact. Development along these lines ended when the Navy decided to withdraw the escort carriers. Northrop continued development of the N-156, both as a two-seat advanced trainer, designated as N-156T, and a single-seat fighter, designated as N-156F.
Another highly influential figure was chief engineer Welko Gasich, who convinced Schmued that the engines must be located within the fuselage for maximum performance. This led to the January 1956 PD-2812 version which began to look a lot like the final product, although this version had a long-span low-mounted elevator with notable anhedral. March 1956&#x27;s PD-2832 moved to a more conventional elevator and had a strongly swept vertical stabilizer. The design underwent several further versions over the next year which experimented with different nose designs and continued to lengthen the fuselage. The final design, PD-2879D, emerged in December 1956.

Gasich also introduced the concept of &quot;life cycle cost&quot; into fighter design, which provided the foundation for the F-5&#x27;s low operating cost and long service life. A Northrop design study stated &quot;The application of advanced technology was used to provide maximum force effectiveness at minimum cost. This became the Northrop philosophy in the development of the T-38 and F-5 lightweight trainer and fighter aircraft.&quot;

===Into production===
The N-156T was quickly selected by the United States Air Force as a replacement for the T-33 in July 1956. On 12 June 1959, the first prototype aircraft, which was subsequently designated as YT-38 Talon, performed its first flight. By the time production had ended in January 1972, a total of 1,189 Talons had been produced. Development of the N-156F continued at a lower priority as a private venture by Northrop; on 25 February 1958, an order for three prototypes was issued for a prospective low-cost fighter that could be supplied under the Military Assistance Program for distribution to less-developed nations. The first N-156F flew at Edwards Air Force Base on 30 July 1959, exceeding the speed of sound on its first flight.

Although testing of the N-156F was successful, demonstrating unprecedented reliability and proving superior in the ground-attack role to the USAF&#x27;s existing North American F-100 Super Sabres, official interest in the Northrop type waned, and by 1960 it looked as if the program was a failure. Interest revived in 1961 when the United States Army tested it, (along with the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and Fiat G.91) for reconnaissance and close-support. Although all three types proved capable during army testing, operating fixed-wing combat aircraft was legally the responsibility of the Air Force, which would not agree to allow the Army to operate fixed-wing combat aircraft, a situation repeated with the C-7 Caribou.

In 1962, the Kennedy Administration revived the requirement for a low-cost export fighter, selecting the N-156F as winner of the F-X competition on 23 April 1962, subsequently becoming the &quot;F-5A&quot;, and was ordered into production in October that year. It was named under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system, which included a re-set of the fighter number series. Northrop manufactured a total of 624 F-5As, including three YF-5A prototypes, before production ended in 1972. A further 200 F-5B two-seat trainer aircraft, lacking nose-mounted cannons but otherwise combat-capable, and 86 RF-5A reconnaissance aircraft, fitted with four-camera noses, were also built. In addition, Canadair built 240 first generation F-5s under license, CASA in Spain built 70 more aircraft.

The Royal Norwegian Air Force placed the first international order on 28 February 1964.

===F-5E and F-5F Tiger II===

In 1970, Northrop won the International Fighter Aircraft (IFA) competition to replace the F-5A, with better air-to-air performance against aircraft like the Soviet MiG-21. The resulting aircraft, initially known as F-5A-21, subsequently became the F-5E. It had two more powerful GE J85-21 engines, each with dry thrust and in afterburner, and had a lengthened and enlarged fuselage to accommodate more fuel. Its wings were fitted with enlarged leading edge extensions, giving an increased wing area and improved maneuverability. The aircraft&#x27;s avionics were more sophisticated, crucially including a radar (initially the Emerson Electric AN/APQ-153) (F-5A and B had no radar). It retained the gun armament of two M39 cannons, one on either side of the nose of the F-5A. Various specific avionics fits could be accommodated at a customer&#x27;s request, including an inertial navigation system, TACAN and ECM equipment. Additionally the two position nose landing gear from the Canadian CF-5 was incorporated to reduce takeoff distance.

The first F-5E flew on 11 August 1972. A two-seat combat-capable trainer, the F-5F, was offered, first flying on 25 September 1974, at Edwards Air Force Base, with a new nose, that was three feet longer, which, unlike the F-5B that did not mount a gun, allowed it to retain a single M39 cannon, albeit with a reduced ammunition capacity. The two-seater was equipped with the Emerson AN/APQ-157 radar, which is a derivative of the AN/APQ-153 radar, with dual control and display systems to accommodate the two-men crew, and the radar has the same range of AN/APQ-153, around 10 nmi. On 6 April 1973, the 425th TFS at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, received the first F-5E Tiger II.
A reconnaissance version, the RF-5E Tigereye, with a sensor package in the nose displacing the radar and one cannon, was also offered.

The F-5E eventually received the official name Tiger II; 792 F-5Es, 146 F-5Fs and 12 RF-5Es were eventually built by Northrop. More were built under license overseas: 91 F-5Es and F-5Fs in Switzerland, 68 by Korean Air in South Korea, and 308 in Taiwan.

The F-5E proved to be a successful combat aircraft in service with US allies, but had no combat service with the US Air Force, though the F-5A with modifications, designated F-5C, was flown by the US in Vietnam. The F-5E evolved into the single-engine F-5G, which was rebranded the F-20 Tigershark. It lost out on export sales to the F-16 Fighting Falcon in the 1980s.

===Upgrades===
The F-5E experienced numerous upgrades in its service life, with the most significant one being adopting a new planar array radar, Emerson AN/APQ-159 with a range of 20 nmi to replace the original AN/APQ-153. Similar radar upgrades were also proposed for F-5F, with the derivative of AN/APQ-159, the AN/APQ-167, to replace the AN/APQ-157, but that was cancelled. The latest radar upgrade included the Emerson AN/APG-69, which was the successor of AN/APQ-159, incorporating mapping capability. However, most nations chose not to upgrade for financial reasons, and the radar saw very little service in USAF aggressor squadrons and Swiss Air Force.

Various F-5 versions remain in service with many nations. Having taken delivery of its first F-5 Tigers in 1979, Singapore operated approximately 49 modernized and re-designated F-5S (single-seat) and F-5T (two-seat) aircraft until the early 2010s when they were retired from service. Upgrades included new FIAR Grifo-F X-band radar from Galileo Avionica (similar in performance to the AN/APG-69), updated cockpits with multi-function displays, and compatibility with the AIM-120 AMRAAM and Rafael Python air-to-air missiles.
One National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) F-5E was given a modified fuselage shape for its employment in the Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration program carried out by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). It is preserved in the Valiant Air Command Warbird Museum at Titusville, Florida.

The Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) had their F-5s undergo an extensive upgrade program, resulting in the aircraft re-designated as F-5T Tigris. They are armed with Python III and IV missiles; and equipped with the Dash helmet-mounted cueing system.

Similar programs have been carried out in Chile and Brazil with the help of Elbit. The Chilean upgrade, called the F-5 Tiger III Plus, incorporated a new Elta EL/M-2032 radar and other improvements. The Brazilian program, re-designated as F-5M, adds a new Grifo-F radar along with several avionics and cockpit refurbishments, including the Dash helmet. The F-5M has been equipped with new weapon systems such as the Beyond Visual Range Derby missile, Python IV short-range air-to-air missile, SMKB &quot;smart&quot; bombs, and several other weapons.

==Operational history==

===United States===
The F-5 entered service with the USAF&#x27;s 4441st Combat Crew Training Squadron at Williams Air Force Base, which had the role of training pilots and ground crew for customer nations, including Norway, on 30 April 1964. At that point, it was still not intended that the aircraft be used in significant numbers by the USAF itself.

USAF doctrine with regard to the F-5 changed following operational testing and limited deployment in 1965. Preliminary combat evaluation of the F-5A began at the Air Proving Ground Center, Eglin AFB, Florida, in mid-1965 under the code name Project &quot;Sparrow Hawk&quot;. One airframe was lost in the course of the project, through pilot error, on 24 June.

In October 1965, the USAF began a five-month combat evaluation of the F-5A titled &quot;Skoshi Tiger&quot;. A total of 12 aircraft were delivered for trials to the 4503rd Tactical Fighter Squadron, and after modification with probe and drogue aerial refueling equipment, armor and improved instruments, were redesignated &quot;F-5C&quot;. Over the next six months, they flew in combat in Vietnam, flying more than 2,600 sorties, both from the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing at Bien Hoa Air Base over South Vietnam and from Da Nang Air Base, where operations were flown over Laos. Nine aircraft were lost in Vietnam, seven to enemy ground fire and two to operational causes.

Operations with 3rd TFW were declared a success, with the F-5 generally rated as being as capable a ground-attacker as the F-100, albeit having a shorter range. However, the program was more a political gesture that was intended to aid the export of F-5s than a serious consideration of the type for US service. (Following &quot;Skoshi Tiger&quot; the Philippine Air Force acquired 23 F-5A and B models in 1965. These aircraft, along with remanufactured Vought F-8 Crusaders, eventually replaced the Philippine Air Force&#x27;s F-86 Sabres in the air defense and ground attack roles.)

From April 1966, the USAF aircraft continued operations under the auspices of the 10th Fighter Squadron, Commando, with their number boosted to 17 aircraft.
In June 1967, the surviving aircraft of the 10th Fighter Squadron, Commando, were transferred to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF). In view of the performance, agility and size of the F-5, it might have appeared to be a good match against the similar MiG-21 in air combat; however, US doctrine was to use heavy, faster and longer-range aircraft like the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II over North Vietnam.

The F-5 was also adopted as an opposing forces (OPFOR) &quot;aggressor&quot; for dissimilar training role because of its small size and performance similarities to the Soviet MiG-21. In realistic trials at Nellis AFB in 1977, called ACEVAL/AIMVAL, the F-14 reportedly scored slightly better than a 2:1 kill ratio against the simpler F-5, while the F-15 scored slightly less. There is some contradiction of these reports, another source reports that &quot;For the first three weeks of the test, the F-14s and F-15s were hopelessly outclassed and demoralized&quot;; after adapting to qualities of the F-5 carrying the new all aspect AIM-9L missile and implementing rule changes to artificially favor long range radar-guided missiles, &quot;the F-14s did slightly better than breaking even with the F-5s in non-1 v 1 engagements; the F-15s got almost 2:1&quot;. A 2012 Discovery Channel documentary &quot;Great Planes&quot; reported that in USAF exercises, F-5 aggressor aircraft were competitive enough with more modern and expensive fighters to only be at small disadvantage in Within Visual Range (WVR) combat.
The F-5E served with the US Air Force from 1975 until 1990, in the 64th Aggressor Squadron and 65th Aggressor Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, and with the 527th Aggressor Squadron at RAF Alconbury in the UK and the 26th Aggressor Squadron at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines. The US Marines purchased used F-5s from the Air Force in 1989 to replace their F-21s, which served with VMFT-401 at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. The US Navy used the F-5E extensively at the Naval Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN) when it was located at NAS Miramar, California. When TOPGUN relocated to become part of the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center at NAS Fallon, Nevada, the command divested itself of the F-5, choosing to rely on VC-13 (redesignated VFC-13 and which already used F-5s) to employ their F-5s as adversary aircraft. Former adversary squadrons such as VF-43 at NAS Oceana, VF-45 at NAS Key West, VF-126 at NAS Miramar, and VFA-127 at NAS Lemoore have also operated the F-5 along with other aircraft types in support of Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT).

The US Navy F-5 fleet continues to be modernized with 36 low-hour F-5E/Fs purchased from Switzerland in 2006. These were updated as F-5N/Fs with modernized avionics and other improved systems. Currently, the only US Navy and US Marine Corps units flying the F-5 are VFC-13 at NAS Fallon, Nevada, VFC-111 at NAS Key West, Florida and VMFT-401 at MCAS Yuma, Arizona. Currently, VFC-111 operates 18 Northrop F-5N/F Tiger IIs. 17 of these are single-seater F-5Ns and the last is a twin-seater F-5F &quot;FrankenTiger&quot;, the product of grafting the older front-half fuselage of an F-5F into the back-half fuselage of a newer low-hours F-5E acquired from the Swiss Air Force. A total of three &quot;FrankenTigers&quot; were made.

According to the FAA, there are 18 privately owned F-5s in the US, including Canadair CF-5Ds.

===Brazil===

In October 1974, the Brazilian Air Force (&quot;FAB&quot;) ordered 36 F-5E and 6 F-5B aircraft from Northrop for $72 million. The first three aircraft arrived on 12 March 1975. In 1988, FAB acquired 22 F-5E and four F-5F second-hand USAF &quot;aggressor&quot; fighters. A total of 15 of these aircraft were part of the initial batch of 30 aircraft produced by Northrop. In 1990, FAB retired all remaining five F-5Bs; later, they were sent to Brazilian museums around the country.

In 2001, Elbit Systems and Embraer started work on a $230 million Brazilian F-5 modernization program, performed over an eight-year period, upgrading 46 F-5E/F aircraft, re-designated as F-5EM and F-5FM. The modernization centered on several areas: new electronic warfare systems, the Grifo F radar, an air-to-air refueling system, INS/GPS-based navigation, support for new weapons, targeting and self-defense systems, HOTAS, LCD displays, helmet-mounted displays (HMDs), Radar Warning Receiver, encrypted communications, cockpit compatibility for night vision goggles, On-Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS) and various new onboard computer upgrades. One important capability is the secure communication with R-99 airborne early warning platforms and ground stations.

Externally, the new aircraft features a larger nose cone that accommodates the larger radar equipment. The first F-5EM was handed over on 21 September 2005. On 7 July 2003, four Rafael Litening III targeting pods were ordered at a cost of US$13 million, to be used on F-5M together with three Rafael Sky Shield jamming pods ordered on 5 July 2006 at a cost of US$42 million.

In 2009, FAB bought eight single-seat and three twin-seat F-5F used aircraft from Jordan in a US$21 million deal. These aircraft were built between 1975 and 1980. On 14 April 2011, a contract of $153 million was signed with Embraer and Elbit to modernize the additional F-5s bought from Jordan, and to supply one more flight simulator as a continuation of the contract signed in 2000. These F-5s will receive the same configuration as those from the initial 46 F-5s currently completing the upgrade process. The first delivery of this second batch of upgraded jet fighters is scheduled for 2013 with expected use to 2030.

In 2020, the FAB started implementing the new proprietary Datalink System of the Brazilian Armed Forces on the F-5EM, for integrated communication and real-time sharing battlefield/warfare data with AEW&amp;C R-99/E-99 FAB/Embraer aircraft, other aircraft, ships, helicopters, tanks and front/back-ends battlefield control centers, called Link-BR2.

===Ethiopia===
Ethiopia received 10 F-5As and two F-5Bs from the US starting in 1966. In addition to these, Ethiopia had a training squadron equipped with at least eight Lockheed T-33 Shooting Stars. In 1970, Iran transferred at least three F-5As and Bs to Ethiopia. In 1975, another agreement was reached with the US to deliver a number of military aircraft, including 14 F-5Es and three F-5Fs; later in the same year eight F-5Es were transferred while the others were embargoed and delivered to a USAF aggressor Squadron due to the changed political situation. The US also withdrew its personnel and cut diplomatic relations. Ethiopian officers contracted a number of Israelis to maintain American equipment.

The Ethiopian F-5 fighters saw combat action against Somali forces during the Ogaden War (1977–1978). The main Somali fighter aircraft was the MiG-21MF delivered in the 1970s, supported by Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17s delivered in the 1960s by the Soviet Union. Ethiopian F-5E aircraft were used to gain air superiority because they could use the AIM-9B air-to-air missile, while the F-5As were kept for air interdiction and airstrike. During this period Ethiopian F-5Es went on training against Ethiopian F-5As and F-86 Sabres (simulating Somali MiG-21s and MiG-17s).

On 17 July 1977, two F-5s were on combat air patrol near Harer, when four Somali MiG-21MFs were detected nearby. In the engagement, two MiG-21s were shot down while the other two had a midair collision while avoiding an AIM-9B missile. The better-trained F-5 pilots swiftly gained air superiority over the Somali Air Force, shooting down a number of aircraft, while other Somali aircraft were lost to air defense and to incidents. Records indicate that Ethiopian F-5s of the 9th Fighter Squadron &quot;shot down 13 MiGs-17 and 12 MiGs-21 from 20th July until 1st September 1977. All aircraft were hit by Sidewinders (AIM-9).&quot; However at least three F-5s were shot down by air defense forces during attacks against supply bases in western Somalia.

Ethiopian pilots who had flown both the F-5E and the MiG-21 considered the F-5E to be the superior fighter because of its manoeuvrability at low to medium speeds and the fact that it was far easier to fly, allowing the pilot to focus on combat rather than controlling his airplane. This effect was enhanced by the poor quality of pilot training provided by the Soviets, which provided limited flight time and focused exclusively on taking off and landing, with no practical training in air combat.

Ethiopia&#x27;s ace pilot and national hero was Legesse Tefera who is credited with shooting down 6 (or 7) Somali MiGs, thus making him the most successful F-5 pilot.

===Greece===
The Hellenic Air Force was the first European air force to receive the Freedom Fighter. The first F-5As were delivered in 1965, and over the next 8 years a total of about 70 F-5A/Bs were operational. The Hellenic Air Force bought an additional 10 F-5A/Bs from Iran in 1975, and around the same period another batch of 10 F-5A/Bs were acquired from Jordan. Another 10 were acquired from Norway in 1986, and a final 10 NF-5As were purchased from the Netherlands in 1991. The total number of F-5s in operation (including the ex-Iranian machines, 34 RF-5As, and 20 F-5Bs) in the Hellenic Air Force was about 120 aircraft, from 1965 to 2002, when the last F-5 was decommissioned and the type went out of operation in the Hellenic Air Force.

Units that used the F-5 in Greek service:
* 337th Day Interceptor Squadron (1967–1978)
* 341st Day Interceptor Squadron (1965–1993)
* 343rd Day Interceptor Squadron (1966–2001)
* 349th Day Interceptor Squadron (1970–1997)

===Iran===

The Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) received extensive US equipment in the 1960s and 1970s. Iran received its first 11 F-5As and two F-5Bs in February 1965 which were then declared operational in June 1965. Ultimately, Iran received 104 F-5As and 23 F-5Bs by 1972. From January 1974 with the first squadron of 28 F-5Fs, Iran received a total of 166 F-5E/Fs and 15 additional RF-5As with deliveries ending in 1976. While receiving the F-5E and F, Iran began to sell its F-5A and B inventory to other countries, including Ethiopia, Turkey, Greece and South Vietnam; by 1976, many had been sold, except for several F-5Bs retained for training purposes. F-5s were also used by the IIAF&#x27;s aerobatic display team, the Golden Crown.

After the Iranian revolution in 1979, the new Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) was partially successful at keeping Western fighters in service during the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s and the simple F-5 had a good service readiness until late in the war. Initially, Iran took spare parts from foreign sources; later it was able to have its new aircraft industry keep the aircraft flying.

IRIAF F-5s were heavily involved, flying air-to-air and air-to-ground sorties. Iranian F-5s took part in air combat with Iraqi MiG-21s, MiG-23s, MiG-25s, Su-20/22s, Mirage F1s and Super Etendards. The exact combat record is not known with many differing claims from Iraqi, Iranian, Western, and Russian sources. There are reports that an IRIAF F-5E, piloted by Major Yadollah Javadpour, shot down a MiG-25 on 6 August 1983. Russian sources state that the first confirmed kill of a MiG-25 occurred in 1985.

During their first years of service, Iranian F-5s had the advantage in missile technology, using advanced versions of the infrared homing AIM-9 Sidewinder, later lost with deliveries of new missiles and fighters to Iraq.

Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company currently produces three aircraft, the Azarakhsh, Saeqeh, and Kowsar, derived from the F-5.

===Kenya===
In June 1976, Kenya ordered 10 new F-5E and two F-5F aircraft from the U.S. for $70 million.

Starting on 16 October 2011 during Operation Linda Nchi, Kenyan Air Force F-5s supported the Kenyan forces fighting in Somalia against Al Shabab Islamists bombing targets inside Somalia and spearheading the ground forces.

===Malaysia===
In 1975, the Royal Malaysian Air Force received 14 F-5Es and two F-5Bs. In 1982, four F-5Fs were received and the two F-5Bs already in Malaysian service were transferred to the Royal Thai Air Force. In 1983, RMAF received two RF-5E Tigereye. Subsequently, two F-5Es (M29-21 &amp; M29-22) and a F-5F (M29-23) which came with the new &quot;shark nose&quot; and with leading edge root extensions (LERX) version were ordered as attrition replacement. The F-5E was the first supersonic fighter in Royal Malaysian Air Force service and it replaced the former RAAF CAC Sabre as the Royal Malaysian Air Force&#x27;s primary air defense fighter throughout the 1980s and early &#x27;90s. It also served in secondary ground attack role alongside the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk. Five F-5Es and one F-5F were lost in the accident with three fatalities (2 pilots in E (1983 &amp; 1995) and 1 in F (1986), all crashed into the sea). In 2000, all the RMAF F-5s were deactivated, but they were reactivated in 2003 as the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Squadron and Reserve. Several upgrade packages were proposed to extend the service life of the aircraft, but none were taken. In 2015, the F-5s were pulled out of service, but some were kept in storage.

===Mexico===
In 1982, the Mexican Air Force received 10 F-5Es and two F-5Fs after the purchase of 24 IAI Kfir C.1 was blocked by the US, because the Kfir used the American-produced J79 engine. These fighters complemented the Lockheed T-33 and de Havilland Vampire Mk. I (received much earlier), two of the first combat jet aircraft in Mexico. The F-5 gave Mexico its first supersonic warplane, and it saw the formation of Air Squadron 401. On 16 September 1995, after more than 30 military parade flights without incidents, an F-5E collided in midair with three Lockheed T-33s during the military parade for the Independence of Mexico resulting in 10 deaths. As of 2021, the Mexican Air Force has five Northrop F-5E and two F-5F fighters combat ready and for training purposes.

===Morocco===
The Royal Moroccan Air Force received 22 F-5As, two F-5Bs and two RF-5As from the United States between 1966 and 1974. These entered service with the 1st Fighter Squadron. Two additional F-5As were donated by Iran in 1974, and six F-5As were acquired from Jordan in 1976. Three F-5As were involved in the failed 1972 Moroccan coup attempt, attacking King Hassan II of Morocco&#x27;s Boeing 727 in mid-air, before strafing and bombing a military airfield and the royal palace. After the failure of the attempted coup, nearly all F-5 pilots were arrested, and most of them disappeared. Another consequence of the failed coup was that the designation system of Moroccan air force units changed from numerical designations to names. From then on, the F-5A squadron was known as the Borak squadron.

Morocco used its F-5s in the Western Sahara War in reconnaissance and bombing missions. Several aircraft were shot down by 9K32 Strela-2 MANPADS, machine-gun fire, and 9K31 Strela-1 (SA-9) and 2K12 Kub (SA-6) self-propelled anti-aircraft systems. To counter the SA-6 threat, AN/ALR-66 radar warning receivers were installed on the RF-5As and F-5Bs around 1981. These aircraft were grouped into a newly established dedicated reconnaissance unit, the Erige squadron; one of its main tasks was to track the Polisario Front&#x27;s surface-to-air missile systems.

In the same period, Morocco started receiving 16 F-5Es and four F-5Fs, that had been ordered in 1979 thanks to Saudi financing. Deliveries lasted from 1981 to 1983. Shortly after their arrival, the F-5Es were fitted with the same radar warning receivers as the RF-5As and F-5Bs; they also received in-flight refuelling probes. Lastly, Moroccan F-5Es could be equipped with electronic and infrared countermeasures pods, that enhanced their survivability against Polisario surface-to-air missiles. F-5E/Fs were operated by the Borak and Erige squadrons, where they served together with older F-5 versions, as well as the Chahine squadron. During the war in Western Sahara, Moroccan F-5s deployed general-purpose and cluster bombs, unguided rockets, and more rarely AGM-65 Maverick missiles. In total, 15 F-5s are confirmed to have been lost in the course of the Western Sahara War.

Starting in 1990, Morocco received 12 more F-5Es from the United States, a total of 24 F-5Es having been upgraded to the F-5TIII standard.

===Netherlands===
In the mid-1960s, the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) recognized that its fleet of F-84F fighter-bombers and T-33 trainers was in need of replacement. A deal was made with Canadair to produce modified versions of their license-built CF-5A single-seater and CF-5D twin-seater, which where given the designation NF-5A and NF-5B respectively. The NF-5 differed from the CF-5 mainly in having maneuvering flaps, a radar altimeter and a roller map display that is part of a navigation computer system. Later modifications included the addition of chaff/flare dispensers and a radar warning system.

The first NF-5A was handed over in October 1969 at Twente Air Base for 313 Squadron acting as Operational Conversion Unit. The last aircraft was handed over in March 1972. The NF-5As flew under the Dutch registrations K-3001 / K-3075 and the NF-5Bs under K-4002 / K-4030. They were operational at Twenthe AB (OCU, 313 and 315 Squadrons), Eindhoven AB (314 Squadron) and Gilze-Rijen AB (316 Squadron). In total, the RNLAF would receive 75 NF-5As and 30 NF-5Bs.

During the RNLAF transition to the F-16, the NF-5s and Bs were stored at Gilze-Rijen and Woensdrecht air bases. 60 aircraft were sold to Turkey, 11 to Greece and 7 to Venezuela. Some aircraft have been written off during their operational life due to crashes and some remaining aircraft are displayed in museums or used in technical schools. The NF-5As and Bs were operational from 1971 to 1991.

===Norway===
The Royal Norwegian Air Force received 108 Freedom Fighters: 16 RF-5A, 78 F-5A and 14 F-5B. The first 64 were received as military aid. They were used by six squadrons, the first and last being 336 Squadron receiving the first aircraft in February 1966 (formal handing-over ceremony a month later), and deactivating in August 2000. Three aircraft were kept flying until 2007, serving with Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace for tests in the &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; program, supporting development of the Norwegian Penguin anti-ship missile. The aircraft received under military aid were handed off to Greece and Turkey. Of the aircraft bought by the Norwegian government, nine were used in exchange with US authorities for submarines of the .

In October 2011 five F-5A single seaters were given to aircraft maintenance schools around the country; including the Skedsmo, Sola, Bodø, and Bardufoss high schools, and the Royal Norwegian Air Force&#x27;s training center at Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik. The aircraft were disassembled at Moss Airport, Rygge, before delivery to the schools. Of the ten remaining Norwegian F-5s, eight F-5B two-seaters were still for sale as of 2011, six of which were stored in Norway and two in the United States. The two aircraft in the United States had been approved for sale to the American businessman Ross Perot Jr., in 2008, but the deal was blocked by the US government initially. However, in 2015, Perot Jr. got permission and subsequently bought the aircraft for significantly below market price, which caused controversy and public criticism of the government of Norway. Three survivors are exhibited at the Norwegian Armed Forces Aircraft Collection, two at Norsk Luftfartsmuseum in Bodø and one at Flyhistorisk Museum, Sola, near Stavanger.

===Philippines===
The Philippine Air Force acquired 37 F-5A and F-5B from 1965 to 1998. The F-5A/Bs were used by the 6th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Cobras) of the 5th Fighter Wing and the Blue Diamonds aerobatic team, replacing the F-86F Sabre previously used by 1965 and 1968 respectively. The F-5s also underwent an upgrade which equipped it with surplus AN/APQ-153 radars with significant overhaul at the end of the 1970s to stretch their service lives another 15 years.

In 2005, the Philippines decommissioned its remaining F-5A/B fleet, including those received from Taiwan and South Korea.

===Singapore===
Singapore is an important operator of the F-5E/F variant, first ordering the aircraft in 1976 during a massive expansion of the city-state&#x27;s armed forces; delivery of this first batch of 18 F-5Es and three F-5Fs was completed by late February 1979, equipping the newly formed-up No. 144 &quot;Black Kite&quot; Squadron at Tengah Air Base. At the end of 1979, an order was placed for six more F-5Es, which were delivered by 1981. In 1982, an order for three more F-5Fs was placed, these were forward delivered in September 1983 to RAF Leuchars in Scotland where they were taken over by pilots of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). In 1983, the type took over the duties of airborne interception from the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s Mirage IIIOs detachment (rotated between No. 3 &amp; No. 75 Squadron RAAF) stationed at &quot;Tengah&quot;.

Another order for six more F-5Es was placed in 1985, these were delivered the same year and would go on to equip the newly formed-up No. 149 &quot;Shikra&quot; Squadron at &quot;Tengah&quot;. The following year, the RSAF placed an order for its final batch of three F-5Fs and five F-5Es, these were delivered in December 1987 and July 1989, respectively. In a bid to modernize its air force, the Royal Jordanian Air Force put up seven F-5Es for sale in 1994, these were later acquired by Singapore.

From 1990 to 1991, using jigs and toolings purchased from Northrop, Singapore Aircraft Industries (SAI, now ST Aerospace) converted eight existing F-5Es into RF-5E Tigereye variant. Subsequently, these were used to reequip No. 141 &quot;Merlin&quot; Squadron, which had traded in their older Hawker Hunter FR.74S for the newer Tigereyes in 1992 and was by then based at Paya Lebar Air Base, after the 144 Squadron had relocated there in 1986. By June 1993, all three squadrons had been relocated to the base, thus consolidating Singapore&#x27;s F-5E/F operations at &quot;Paya Lebar&quot;.

In 1991, SAI was awarded a contract as the prime contractor to modernize all RSAF F-5E/Fs (including the 7 ex-Jordanian F-5Es); Elbit Systems was the sub-contractor responsible for systems integration. Upgrades include a new X band multi-mode radar (the Italian &quot;FIAR Grifo-F&quot;, with Beyond-visual-range missile and Look-down/shoot-down capabilities), a revamped cockpit with new MIL-STD-1553R databuses, GEC/Ferranti 4510 Head-up display/weapons delivery system, two BAE Systems MED-2067 Multi-function displays, Litton LN-93 INS (similar to the ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk) and Hands On Throttle-And-Stick controls (HOTAS) to reduce pilot workload. Reportedly, the Elisra SPS2000 radar warning receiver and countermeasure system was also installed.

In addition, the starboard M39 20 mm cannon mounted in the nose was removed to make way for additional avionics (the sole cannon on the two-seaters was removed because of this), and to improve maneuverability, upgraded aircraft received larger leading edge root extensions (LERX). The process began in March 1996 and was completed by 2001, receiving the new designation of &quot;F-5S/T&quot;. In 1998, the eight RF-5Es also received the upgrades (except for the radar) and were redesignated as &quot;RF-5S&quot;. Each F-5S/T upgraded reportedly cost SGD$6 million.

By end of 2009, the type had accumulated more than 170,000 hours of flight time in Singapore service with only two F-5Es being lost in separate accidents (in 1984 and 1991, respectively). 144 Squadron, the last squadron operating F-5Es, disbanded in September 2015 after the F-5S was retired.

=== South Korea ===
The Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) purchased F-5A/Bs in 1965, and it purchased F-5Es in August 1974. KF-5 variants were built by Korean Air under license between 1982 and 1986.

The F-5E/Fs and KF-5E/Fs were to be replaced by FA-50s and after 2001, by the plans to eventually field the Korean F-X Phase 3.

=== Spain ===

Spain has operated F-5 many decades, and upgrades in the early 21st century there is still in service in the 2020s although they are reaching the end of their career.

On 11 January 1965 Spain announced the choice of the F-5 to replace their T-33 and F-86. During the evaluation phase, an F-5B crashed near Torrejón Air Base, killing both occupants, a Northrop pilot and a pilot from the Ejército del Aire. The contract included 70 units, 8 of them being manufactured by Northrop, 2 disassembled and assembled in Spain, and the remaining 6 in the form of components and structures ready construction. The remaining 62 would be built under license by CASA in the factory at Getafe. The first of this Spanish built batch would take off on 22 May 1968 from the Getafe Air Base flown by a Northrop test pilot. The first delivery to the Ejército del Aire would be on 19 June 1969, being 2 F-5B for the 202 Escuadrón, based at Morón de la Frontera. The first delivery consisted on all F-5B, being the single-seater F-5A and RF-5A delivered later. The last of the 70 airframes was received by the Ejército del Aire on 11 April 1972.

The F-5B was ascribed to the Ala 73 at Talavera la Real Air Base, dedicated to training. Additionally to the aforementioned Escuadrón 202, the Escuadrón 204 received RF-5A. This unit would later become the Ala 21 in 1971.

With the increasing tension with Morocco during the later phase of the Francoist government, the Spanish CASA/Northrop F-5A saw action during the conflict in the Spanish Sahara, being deployed at the Gando Air Base with more than 500 real combat missions. This deployment became permanent from 1974 on, being formalized in 1976. Two F-5B and all F-5A with even registration were ascribed to Ala 46 in the Escuadrón 464 at the Gando Air Base, until their replacement in 1982 by the newly acquired Dassault-Breguet F1EE, being the F-5 sent back to Morón de la Frontera.

In 1989 a mid-air accident is suffered by an F-5B due to a structural failure of a wing. All F-5 fleet is grounded in search for signs of material fatigue, and as a result of it, many of them are retired. The remaining single-seaters (F-5A and RF-5A) are transferred in 1995 to the Ala 23 in Talavera la Real, together with some of the retired airframes, used for spare parts. That would be the final destination of the Spanish single-seaters where they would be retired over the late 1990s.

On the other hand, as a result of the 1990 accident, all twin-seaters are sent to the CASA Getafe Factory to be maintained and renovated. A new modernisation program in 2008 intended to extend their operational life until 2025, receiving glass cockpits and zero-zero ejection seats.

As of the early 2020s, Spain has a fleet of about 20 F-5s that it is planning to operate until at least 2028, as no replacement has yet been found. The aircraft have been in service for about 50 years and, with continued maintenance, have several years of service.

===Switzerland===
The Swiss Air Force flies a total of 22 F-5E and 4 F-5F aircraft, down from a peak of 98 and 12 in 1981. They were chosen chiefly because of their excellent performance, suitability for the unique Swiss Air Force mission, and their relatively low maintenance cost per flight hour.

It had been expected these aircraft would be replaced by the Saab JAS 39 Gripen, but in May 2014, a referendum by the Swiss people decided against the purchase of the Gripens.

For the foreseeable future, the Swiss Air Force will continue to fly its present F-5s. There are still plans by the Swiss Air Force and in the Swiss parliament to fly 18 F-5E and four F-5F models. This would also include the continued operation of the Patrouille Suisse, in F-5Es until 2018.

In September 2020 the Swiss people voted yes in a referendum to get a replacement. With 50.1% to 49.9% and only 8670 votes between.

The Swiss Air Force has decided to replace the aircraft with 36 F-35As.

In March 2024, The Swiss Federal Office for Armaments started delivery of 22 decommissioned F-5E/F Tiger II fighter jets to the United States. The first aircraft was picked up by the United States Marine Corps on 18 March from Emmen Air Force Station aboard a Lockheed KC-130J transport aircraft. The sale, finalized in 2020, encompasses 16 single-seat F-5E and 6 twin-seat F-5F variants, along with associated ground equipment, spare parts, and logistical support for in-country storage and preparation for transport to the U.S. The total value of the sale is estimated at $32.4 million.

===Taiwan===
The Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF, Taiwan&#x27;s air force) received its first batch of seven F-5As and two F-5Bs under the US Military Assistance Program in 1965. By 1971, the ROCAF was operating 72 F-5As and 11 F-5Bs. During 1972, the US borrowed 48 ROCAF F-5As to lend to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force before the withdrawal of US forces from Vietnam. By 1973, most of those loaned F-5As were not in flying condition, thus the US opted to return 20 F-5As to Taiwan by drawing nine F-5As from US reserves while repairing 11 from South Vietnam. An additional 28 new F-5Es were issued to Taiwan by May 1975. By 1973, Taiwan&#x27;s AIDC started local production of a first batch of 100 F-5Es, the first of six Peace Tiger production batches. By end of 1986 when the production line closed after completing Peace Tiger 6, the AIDC had produced 242 F-5Es and 66 F-5Fs. Taiwan was the largest operator of the type at one time, having 336 F-5E/Fs in inventory. The last batch of AIDC F-5E/Fs featured the F-20&#x27;s shark nose.

With the introduction of 150 F-16s, 60 Mirage 2000-5s and 130 F-CK-1s in the mid-to-late-1990s, the F-5E/F series became second line fighters in ROCAF service and mostly are now withdrawn from service as squadrons converted to new fighters entering ROCAF service. Seven low airframe hours F-5Es were sent to ST Aerospace to convert them to RF-5E standard to fulfill a reconnaissance role previously undertaken by the retiring Lockheed RF-104G in ROCAF service. As of 2009, only about 40 ROCAF F-5E/Fs still remain in service in training roles with about 90–100 F-5E/Fs held in reserve. The other retired F-5E/F are either scrapped, or used as decoys painted in colors representing the main front line F-16, Mirage 2000-5 or F-CK-1 fighters, and deployed around major air bases.

Taiwan also tried to upgrade the F-5E/F fleet with AIDC&#x27;s Tiger 2000/2001 program. The first flight took place on 24 July 2002. The program would replace the F-5E/F&#x27;s radar with F-CK-1&#x27;s GD-53 radar and allow the fighter to carry a single TC-2 BVRAAM on the centerline. But lack of interest from the ROCAF eventually killed the program. The only prototype is on display in AIDC in Central Taiwan.

On 22 March 2021, two Taiwanese pilots flying F-5E&#x27;s crashed into each other during a training mission resulting in the third crash within six months. Two pilots died after the crash.

===South Vietnam / Vietnam===

In June 1967, the US donated the surviving aircraft of 10th FCS USAF to South Vietnam. The president of South Vietnam had asked the US for F-4 Phantoms, but these were in high demand, while the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) was flying only ground support missions, operating only Douglas A-1 Skyraider attackers at that point. In addition, the North Vietnamese Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF) was not sending aircraft over South Vietnam. Hence the RVNAF did not require an aircraft with advanced air to air capabilities (like the F-4). A dedicated RVNAF unit was formed – the 522nd Fighter Squadron.

248 RVNAF aircraft were flown out of South Vietnam to Thailand during the Fall of Saigon in 1975. At least 25 F-5Es were reclaimed by the US, while one F-5B was transferred to Thailand. North Vietnam captured approximately 877 aircraft, of which 87 were reported as F-5As and 27 were F-5Es.

In November 1975, the Vietnamese government gave the Soviet military an opportunity to select captured US equipment for research and intelligence purposes. A complete F-5, along with two complete spare engines, spare parts, and ground support equipment, were loaded onto a Soviet cargo ship. Several other F-5s were later transferred by Vietnam to the USSR, Poland and Czechoslovakia.

The VPAF reportedly used 41 F-5s operationally. Others were decommissioned and put on display at museums in Vietnam. The 935th Fighter Regiment of the VPAF 372nd Air Division became the only unit in the world to simultaneously fly both the MiG-21 and F-5. The type was used for combat by the VPAF, in ground–attack sorties against the Khmer Rouge.

Gradually, a lack of critical spare parts in Vietnam caused initially by a US embargo and later by termination of manufacturing and dwindling stocks – grounded the remaining F-5s. However, in May 2017 it was reported that the VPAF was considering upgrading particular systems in some retired aircraft, in order to put them back into service.

===Venezuela===

After a reorganization of the Venezuelan Air Force in the late 1960s, the government realized that it was time to replace its obsolete de Havilland Vampires and Venoms active at that time, as well as the last surviving F-86 Sabres in active duty. In 1971, 54 Canadian-built CF-5As were put in storage, after the RCAF could not take them due to budget cuts. From this batch, Venezuela acquired 16 CF-5As and two CF-5Ds. In 1972, after all the aircraft were delivered, the F-86s, Venoms, and Vampires were finally scrapped.

The F-5 became the first military plane in Venezuela capable of flying at supersonic speeds. After a legal dispute between Canadair and Northrop, two more CF-5Ds were built and delivered to Venezuela in 1974. Their first base of operations was the General Rafael Urdaneta Air Base in Maracaibo. After 1974, the fleet was relocated to Teniente Vicente Landaeta Gil Air Base in Barquisimeto.

In 1979, after several upgrades to the fleet&#x27;s communication, navigation and approximation equipment, the aircraft were renamed VF-5s, designating the CF-5As as VF-5As and the CF-5Ds as VF-5Ds. Venezuelan F-5s could also carry weaponry such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, Mk.82 and M117 bombs, and 70mm rocket launchers.

In 1991, after tensions between Colombia and Venezuela almost led to a conflict, the air force started yet another modernization program for the F-5s, called &quot;Proyecto Grifo&quot; (Project Gryphon). Some aircraft (VF-5D number 5681 and VF-5A number 9124) were sent to Singapore for testing, then brought back for upgrade of the remaining airframes. That same year, a small fleet of four NF-5Bs and a single NF-5A, was acquired from the Netherlands to replace aircraft lost in previous years.

In 1992, during the coup d&#x27;état attempt against president Carlos Andres Perez, 3 F-5s were lost to a rebel-operated OV-10 Bronco bombing Barquisimeto Air Base. The failed coup delayed the modernization program for a year, finally coming together in 1993. The fleet was equipped with inertial laser navigation systems (similar to those in Venezuelan F-16s), IFFs, HUDs, refueling probes and modernized engines with an estimated lifespan of 22 years.

In 2002, small upgrades were made to the remaining F-5s. The fleet was kept operational until 2010, when a batch of Hongdu JL-8s was delivered as their replacement. By late 2010, it was known that at least one VF-5D was in flight-worthy condition; it is unknown if more aircraft are in operational condition.

Between 1972 and 2002, a total of 9 Venezuelan F-5s were lost.

===Yemen===
In March 1979, following North Yemen&#x27;s defeat in the Yemenite War of 1979, the United States gave Saudi Arabia the permission to transfer four Northrop F-5B trainers to North Yemen. Additionally, Saudi Arabia financed the procurement of twelve F-5E fighters. By the end of the year, all 16 aircraft had arrived. This did not leave enough time to properly train local pilots and ground crews to operate them. Hence, the Saudis agreed with Taiwan to deploy a group of 80 Republic of China Air Force pilots and ground personnel to Sana&#x27;a. They formed the 112th Squadron of the Yemen Arab Republic Air Force (YARAF), which was also known as the Desert Squadron. Most of the Squadron&#x27;s members were Taiwanese until 1985, by when enough Yemenis were trained on the F-5 to take over their duties. However, some Taiwanese personnel remained in the country: in 1990, no less than 700 Taiwanese served in Yemen. They were finally withdrawn in 1991, after the Yemeni unification.

North Yemeni F-5Es have seen combat during the 1994 civil war. On 6 May, two South Yemeni MiG-21s were claimed shot down by Major Nabi Ali Ahmad, using AIM-9 missiles. According to South Yemeni sources, only one MiG-21bis was shot down in an air combat, and its pilot killed. Reportedly, the North Yemenis subsequently deployed their Tiger IIs for air-to-air combat only. On 15 May, two helicopters (probably Mil Mi-8s) were shot down, one of them supposedly by Major Nabi Ali Ahmad. On 28 May, an F-5E was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. On 20 June, a South Yemeni MiG-21 was shot down over Al Anad Air Base in an air combat with two F-5Es, and its pilot was killed. Lastly, on 29 June, an encounter between two YARAF F-5Es and a single South Yemeni MiG-29 was reported. However, neither side opened fire.

Following the North&#x27;s victory in the civil war, the F-5 fleet was integrated into the unified Yemeni Air Force. However, the number of F-5s in service declined over the years. In 2003, there were negotiations with Singapore for the overhaul and upgrade of the remaining aircraft. However, nothing came out of it. Around 2010, only six aircraft were operational, partly thanks to US aid packages. In the night of 29–30 March 2015, at least one F-5B and one F-5E were destroyed on the ground at Sanaa International Airport by Royal Saudi Air Force bombardments, in the first days of the Saudi-led intervention.

===Others===
Saudi Arabia deployed F-5Es during the Gulf War, flying close air support and aerial interdiction missions against Iraqi units in Kuwait. One Royal Saudi Air Force F-5E was lost to ground fire on 13 February 1991, resulting in the death of the pilot.

AeroGroup, a private commercial company in the US, operates the CF-5B as a fighter lead-in aircraft for training and for other support services. There were 17 aircraft originally purchased from the Canadian Government with US State Department approval and then imported into the US in 2006.

Since 2013, Tunisian F-5s have been used in strike missions in support of major military offensives in the border region of Mount Chaambi against Ansar al-Sharia and al-Qaeda-linked militants.

F-5s were used by the Libyan Air Force at Wheelus Air Base in Tripoli, Libya from 1968 to 1969.

===Derivatives===

====F-20 Tigershark====
In comparison to later fighters, the improved F-5E had some weaknesses; these included marginal acceleration, rearward visibility, and fuel fraction, and a lack of Beyond Visual Range (BVR) weapons once such radar–guided missiles became reliable during the 1980s. The F-5G, later renamed the F-20 Tigershark, aimed to correct these weaknesses while maintaining a small size and low cost to produce a competitive fighter. Compared to the F-5E, it had 60% more power, a higher climb rate and acceleration, better cockpit visibility, more modern radar and BVR capability, and competitive performance with fourth generation fighters. Like the F-5, it had better cost–effectiveness as it had the minimum necessary features relative to its competition to perform its air superiority mission. As an example, in the 1960s and early 1970s, the F-5&#x27;s lack of BVR missiles was not a significant disadvantage as the kill rate of such missiles was approximately 8% to 10%, and the performance and loss of surprise (radar warning to the enemy) cost of carrying them was not practically justified. By the early 1980s, the American AIM-7 Sparrow radar-guided missile in its &quot;M&quot; version was realistically exceeding a 60% kill rate, and was integrated onto the F-20. Brigadier General Chuck Yeager, test pilot and the first man to break the sound barrier, referred to the F-20 as &quot;the finest fighter&quot;. Despite its performance and affordable cost, the F-20 lost out for foreign sales against the similarly capable but more expensive F-16, which was being procured in large numbers by the US Air Force and was viewed as having greater support.

====Northrop YF-17====
The Northrop YF-17&#x27;s main design elements date from the F-5 based internal Northrop project N-300. The N-300 featured a longer fuselage, small leading-edge root extensions (LERX), and more powerful GE15-J1A1 turbojets. The wing was moved higher on the fuselage to increase ordnance flexibility. The N-300 further evolved into the P-530 Cobra. The P-530&#x27;s wing planform and nose section was similar to the F-5, with a trapezoidal shape formed by a sweep of 20° at the quarter-chord line, and an unswept trailing edge, but was over double the area. While the YF-17 lost its bid for the USAF lightweight fighter, it would be developed into the larger McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.

====Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration====
A single ex-USN F-5E was modified to carry out research into reducing noise from supersonic flight by shaping the shock waves produced by the aircraft.

<doc id="11144" wikidata="Q134194" url="?curid=11144" title="Fresco">
<text>Fresco ( or frescoes) is a technique of mural painting executed upon freshly laid (&quot;wet&quot;) lime plaster. Water is used as the vehicle for the dry-powder pigment to merge with the plaster, and with the setting of the plaster, the painting becomes an integral part of the wall. The word &quot;fresco&quot; () is derived from the Italian adjective &quot;fresco&quot; meaning &quot;fresh&quot;, and may thus be contrasted with fresco-secco or secco mural painting techniques, which are applied to dried plaster, to supplement painting in fresco. The fresco technique has been employed since antiquity and is closely associated with Italian Renaissance painting.

The word &quot;fresco&quot; is commonly and inaccurately used in English to refer to any wall painting regardless of the plaster technology or binding medium. This, in part, contributes to a misconception that the most geographically and temporally common wall painting technology was the painting into wet lime plaster. Even in apparently &quot;buon fresco&quot; technology, the use of supplementary organic materials was widespread, if underrecognized.

==Technology==
&quot;Buon fresco&quot; pigment is mixed with room temperature water and is used on a thin layer of wet, fresh plaster, called the intonaco (after the Italian word for plaster). Because of the chemical makeup of the plaster, a binder is not required, as the pigment mixed solely with the water will sink into the intonaco, which itself becomes the medium holding the pigment. The pigment is absorbed by the wet plaster; after a number of hours, the plaster dries in reaction to air: it is this chemical reaction which fixes the pigment particles in the plaster.
The chemical processes are as follows:
* calcination of limestone in a lime kiln: CaCO3 → CaO + CO2
* slaking of quicklime: CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2
* setting of the lime plaster: Ca(OH)2 + CO2 → CaCO3 + H2O
In painting &quot;buon fresco&quot;, a rough underlayer called the &quot;arriccio&quot; is added to the whole area to be painted and allowed to dry for some days. Many artists sketched their compositions on this underlayer, which would never be seen, in a red pigment called sinopia, a name also used to refer to these under-paintings. Later,new techniques for transferring paper drawings to the wall were developed. The main lines of a drawing made on paper were pricked over with a point, the paper held against the wall, and a bag of soot (&quot;spolvero&quot;) banged on them to produce black dots along the lines. If the painting was to be done over an existing fresco, the surface would be roughened to provide better adhesion. On the day of painting, the intonaco, a thinner, smooth layer of fine plaster was added to the amount of wall that was expected to be completed that day, sometimes matching the contours of the figures or the landscape, but more often just starting from the top of the composition. This area is called the &quot;giornata&quot; (&quot;day&#x27;s work&quot;), and the different day stages can usually be seen in a large fresco, by a faint seam that separates one from the next.

&quot;Buon frescoes&quot; are difficult to create because of the deadline associated with the drying plaster. Generally, a layer of plaster will require ten to twelve hours to dry; ideally, an artist would begin to paint after one hour and continue until two hours before the drying time—giving seven to nine hours&#x27; working time. Once a &quot;giornata&quot; is dried, no more &quot;buon fresco&quot; can be done, and the unpainted intonaco must be removed with a tool before starting again the next day. If mistakes have been made, it may also be necessary to remove the whole intonaco for that area—or to change them later, &quot;a secco&quot;.
An indispensable component of this process is the carbonatation of the lime, which fixes the colour in the plaster ensuring durability of the fresco for future generations.

A technique used in the popular frescoes of Michelangelo and Raphael was to scrape indentations into certain areas of the plaster while still wet to increase the illusion of depth and to accent certain areas over others. The eyes of the people of the School of Athens are sunken-in using this technique which causes the eyes to seem deeper and more pensive. Michelangelo used this technique as part of his trademark &#x27;outlining&#x27; of his central figures within his frescoes.

In a wall-sized fresco, there may be ten to twenty or even more &quot;giornate&quot;, or separate areas of plaster. After five centuries, the &quot;giornate&quot;, which were originally nearly invisible, have sometimes become visible, and in many large-scale frescoes, these divisions may be seen from the ground. Additionally, the border between giornate was often covered by an &quot;a secco&quot; painting, which has since fallen off.

One of the first painters in the post-classical period to use this technique was the Isaac Master (or Master of the Isaac fresco, and thus a name used to refer to the unknown master of a particular painting) in the Upper Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi. A person who creates fresco is called a frescoist.

==Other types of wall painting==
A secco or fresco-secco painting is done on dry plaster (&quot;secco&quot; meaning &quot;dry&quot; in Italian). The pigments thus require a binding medium, such as egg (tempera), glue or oil to attach the pigment to the wall. It is important to distinguish between &quot;a secco&quot; work done on top of &quot;buon fresco&quot;, which according to most authorities was in fact standard from the Middle Ages onwards, and work done entirely &quot;a secco&quot; on a blank wall. Generally, &quot;buon fresco&quot; works are more durable than any &quot;a secco&quot; work added on top of them, because &quot;a secco&quot; work lasts better with a roughened plaster surface, whilst true fresco should have a smooth one. The additional &quot;a secco&quot; work would be done to make changes, and sometimes to add small details, but also because not all colours can be achieved in true fresco, because only some pigments work chemically in the very alkaline environment of fresh lime-based plaster. Blue was a particular problem, and skies and blue robes were often added &quot;a secco&quot;, because neither azurite blue nor lapis lazuli, the only two blue pigments then available, works well in wet fresco.

It has also become increasingly clear, thanks to modern analytical techniques, that even in the early Italian Renaissance painters quite frequently employed &quot;a secco&quot; techniques so as to allow the use of a broader range of pigments. In most early examples this work has now entirely vanished, but a whole painting done &quot;a secco&quot; on a surface roughened to give a key for the paint may survive very well, although damp is more threatening to it than to &quot;buon fresco&quot;.

A third type called a &quot;mezzo-fresco&quot; is painted on nearly dry intonaco—firm enough not to take a thumb-print, says the sixteenth-century author Ignazio Pozzo—so that the pigment only penetrates slightly into the plaster. By the end of the sixteenth century this had largely displaced &quot;buon fresco&quot;, and was used by painters such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo or Michelangelo. This technique had, in reduced form, the advantages of &quot;a secco&quot; work.

The three key advantages of work done entirely &quot;a secco&quot; were that it was quicker, mistakes could be corrected, and the colours varied less from when applied to when fully dry—in wet fresco there was a considerable change.

For wholly &quot;a secco&quot; work, the intonaco is laid with a rougher finish, allowed to dry completely and then usually given a key by rubbing with sand. The painter then proceeds much as he or she would on a canvas or wood panel.

==History==


=== Egypt and ancient Near East ===
The first known Egyptian fresco was found in Tomb 100 at Hierakonpolis, and dated to . Several of the themes and designs visible in the fresco are otherwise known from other Naqada II objects, such as the Gebel el-Arak Knife. It shows the scene of a &quot;Master of Animals&quot;, a man fighting against two lions, individual fighting scenes, and Egyptian and foreign boats. Ancient Egyptians painted many tombs and houses, but those wall paintings are not frescoes.

An old fresco from Mesopotamia is the &quot;Investiture of Zimri-Lim&quot; (modern Syria), dating from the early 18th century BC.

=== Aegean civilizations ===

The oldest frescoes done in the &quot;buon fresco&quot; method date from the first half of the second millennium BCE during the Bronze Age and are to be found among Aegean civilizations, more precisely Minoan art from the island of Crete and other islands of the Aegean Sea. The most famous of these, the &quot;Bull-Leaping Fresco&quot;, depicts a sacred ceremony in which individuals jump over the backs of large bulls. The oldest surviving Minoan frescoes are found on the island of Santorini (classically known as Thera), dated to the Neo-Palatial period ().

While some similar frescoes have been found in other locations around the Mediterranean basin, particularly in Egypt and Morocco, their origins are subject to speculation. Some art historians believe that fresco artists from Crete may have been sent to various locations as part of a trade exchange, a possibility which raises to the fore the importance of this art form within the society of the times. The most common form of &quot;fresco&quot; was Egyptian wall paintings in tombs, usually using the &quot;a secco&quot; technique.

===Classical antiquity===
Frescoes were also painted in ancient Greece, but few of these works have survived. In southern Italy, at Paestum, which was a Greek colony of the Magna Graecia, a tomb containing frescoes dating back to 470 BC, the so-called Tomb of the Diver, was discovered in June 1968. These frescoes depict scenes of the life and society of ancient Greece, and constitute valuable historical testimonials. One shows a group of men reclining at a symposium, while another shows a young man diving into the sea. Etruscan frescoes, dating from the 4th century BC, have been found in the Tomb of Orcus near Veii, Italy.

The richly decorated Thracian frescoes of the Tomb of Kazanlak are dating back to 4th century BC, making it a UNESCO protected World Heritage Site.

Roman wall paintings, such as those at the magnificent Villa dei Misteri (1st century BC) in the ruins of Pompeii, and others at Herculaneum, were completed in &quot;buon fresco.&quot;

Roman (Christian) frescoes from the 1st to 2nd centuries AD were found in catacombs beneath Rome, and Byzantine icons were also found in Cyprus, Crete, Ephesus, Cappadocia, and Antioch. Roman frescoes were done by the artist painting the artwork on the still damp plaster of the wall, so that the painting is part of the wall, actually colored plaster.

Also a historical collection of Ancient Christian frescoes can be found in the Churches of Göreme.

===India===
Thanks to large number of ancient rock-cut cave temples, valuable ancient and early medieval frescoes have been preserved in more than 20 locations of India.
The frescoes on the ceilings and walls of the Ajanta Caves were painted between and are the oldest known frescoes in India. They depict the Jataka tales that are stories of the Buddha&#x27;s life in former existences as Bodhisattva. The narrative episodes are depicted one after another although not in a linear order. Their identification has been a core area of research on the subject since the time of the site&#x27;s rediscovery in 1819. Other locations with valuable preserved ancient and early medieval frescoes include Bagh Caves, Ellora Caves, Sittanavasal, Armamalai Cave, Badami Cave Temples and other locations. Frescoes have been made in several techniques, including tempera technique.

The later Chola paintings were discovered in 1931 within the circumambulatory passage of the Brihadisvara Temple in India and are the first Chola specimens discovered.

Researchers have discovered the technique used in these frescos. A smooth batter of limestone mixture was applied over the stones, which took two to three days to set. Within that short span, such large paintings were painted with natural organic pigments.

During the Nayak period, the Chola paintings were painted over. The Chola frescos lying underneath have an ardent spirit of saivism expressed in them. They probably synchronised with the completion of the temple by Rajaraja Cholan the Great.

The frescoes in Dogra/ Pahari style paintings exist in their unique form at Sheesh Mahal of Ramnagar (105 km from Jammu and 35 km west of Udhampur). Scenes from epics of Mahabharat and Ramayan along with portraits of local lords form the subject matter of these wall paintings. Rang Mahal of Chamba (Himachal Pradesh) is another site of historic Dogri fresco with wall paintings depicting scenes of &quot;Draupti Cheer Haran&quot;, and &quot;Radha- Krishna Leela&quot;. This can be seen preserved at National Museum at New Delhi in a chamber called &quot;Chamba Rang Mahal&quot;.

During the Mughal Era, frescos were used for making interior design on walls and inside the ceilings of domes.
===Sri Lanka===

The Sigiriya Frescoes are found in Sigiriya in Sri Lanka. Painted during the reign of King Kashyapa I (ruled 477 – 495 AD). The generally accepted view is that they are portrayals of women of the royal court of the king depicted as celestial nymphs showering flowers upon the humans below. They bear some resemblance to the Gupta style of painting found in the Ajanta Caves in India. They are, however, far more enlivened and colorful and uniquely Sri Lankan in character. While some scholars contend that these frescos are the only surviving secular art from antiquity found in Sri Lanka today, others argue that they are Buddhist in nature (potentially representing goddesses from Tusita heaven)

The painting technique used on the Sigiriya paintings is &quot;fresco lustro&quot;. It varies slightly from the pure fresco technique in that it also contains a mild binding agent or glue. This gives the painting added durability, as clearly demonstrated by the fact that they have survived, exposed to the elements, for over 1,500 years.

Located in a small sheltered depression a hundred meters above ground only 19 survive today. Ancient references, however, refer to the existence of as many as five hundred of these frescoes.

===Middle Ages===

The late Medieval period and the Renaissance saw the most prominent use of fresco, particularly in Italy, where most churches and many government buildings still feature fresco decoration. This change coincided with the reevaluation of murals in the liturgy. Romanesque churches in Catalonia were richly painted in 12th and 13th century, with both decorative and educational—for the illiterate faithfuls—roles, as can be seen in the MNAC in Barcelona, where is kept a large collection of Catalan romanesque art. In Denmark too, church wall paintings or &quot;kalkmalerier&quot; were widely used in the Middle Ages (first Romanesque, then Gothic) and can be seen in some 600 Danish churches as well as in churches in the south of Sweden, which was Danish at the time.

One of the rare examples of Islamic fresco painting can be seen in Qasr Amra, the desert palace of the Umayyads in the 8th century Magotez.

===Early modern Europe===

Fresco painting continued into the Baroque in southern Europe, for churches and especially palaces. Gianbattista Tiepolo was arguably the last major exponent of this tradition, with huge schemes for palaces in Madrid and Würzburg in Germany.

Northern Romania (historical region of Moldavia) boasts about a dozen painted monasteries, completely covered with frescos inside and out, that date from the last quarter of the 15th century to the second quarter of the 16th century. The most remarkable are the monastic foundations at Voroneţ (1487), Arbore (1503), Humor (1530), and Moldoviţa (1532). Suceviţa, dating from 1600, represents a late return to the style developed some 70 years earlier. The tradition of painted churches continued into the 19th century in other parts of Romania, although never to the same extent.

Henri Clément Serveau produced several frescos including a three by six meter painting for the &quot;Lycée de Meaux&quot;, where he was once a student. He directed the &quot;École de fresques&quot; at , and decorated the &quot;Pavillon du Tourisme&quot; at the 1937 (Paris), &quot;Pavillon de la Ville de Paris&quot;; now at Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. In 1954 he realized a fresco for the Cité Ouvrière du Laboratoire Débat, Garches. He also executed mural decorations for the &quot;Plan des anciennes enceintes de Paris&quot; in the Musée Carnavalet.

The Foujita chapel in Reims completed in 1966, is an example of modern frescos, the interior being painted with religious scenes by the School of Paris painter Tsuguharu Foujita. In 1996, it was designated an historic monument by the French government.

===Mexican muralism===
José Clemente Orozco, Fernando Leal, David Siqueiros and Diego Rivera the famous Mexican artists, renewed the art of fresco painting in the 20th century. Orozco, Siqueiros, Rivera and his wife Frida Kahlo contributed more to the history of Mexican fine arts and to the reputation of Mexican art in general than anybody else. Channeling pre-Columbian Mexican artworks including the true frescoes at Teotihuacan, Orozco, Siqueiros, River and Fernando Leal established the art movement known as &quot;Mexican Muralism&quot;.

===Contemporary===
There have been comparatively few frescoes created since the 1960s but there are some significant exceptions.

The American artist, Brice Marden&#x27;s monochrome works first shown in 1966 at Bykert Gallery, New York were inspired by frescos and &quot;watching masons plastering stucco walls.&quot; While Marden employed the imagistic effects of fresco, David Novros was developing a 50-year practice around the technique. David Novros is an American painter and a muralist of geometric abstraction. In 1968 Donald Judd commissioned Novros to create a work at 101 Spring Street, New York, NY soon after he had purchased the building. Novros used medieval techniques to create the mural by &quot;first preparing a full-scale cartoon, which he transferred to the wet plaster using the traditional pouncing technique,&quot; the act of passing powdered pigment onto the plaster through tiny perforations in a cartoon. The surface unity of the fresco was important to Novros in that the pigment he used bonded with the drying plaster, becoming part of the wall rather than a surface coating. This site-specific work was Novros&#x27;s first true fresco, which was restored by the artist in 2013.

The American painter, James Hyde first presented frescoes in New York at the Esther Rand Gallery, Thompkins Square Park in 1985. At that time Hyde was using true fresco technique on small panels made of cast concrete arranged on the wall. Throughout the next decade Hyde experimented with multiple rigid supports for the fresco plaster including composite board and plate glass. In 1991 at John Good Gallery in New York City, Hyde debuted true fresco applied on an enormous block of Styrofoam. Holland Cotter of the New York Times described the work as &quot;objectifying some of the individual elements that have made modern paintings paintings.&quot; While Hyde&#x27;s work &quot;ranges from paintings on photographic prints to large-scale installations, photography, and abstract furniture design&quot; his frescoes on Styrofoam have been a significant form of his work since the 1980s.

The frescoes have been shown throughout Europe and the United States. In ArtForum David Pagel wrote, &quot;like ruins from some future archaeological dig, Hyde&#x27;s nonrepresentational frescoes on large chunks of Styrofoam give suggestive shape to the fleeting landscape of the present.&quot; Over its long history, practitioners of frescoes always took a careful methodological approach. Hyde&#x27;s frescoes are done improvisationally. The contemporary disposability of the Styrofoam structure contrast the permanence of the classical fresco technique. In 1993, Hyde mounted four automobile sized frescoes on Styrofoam suspended from a brick wall. Progressive Insurance commissioned this site-specific work for the monumental 80- foot atrium in their headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio.

==Conservation of frescoes==

The climate and environment of Venice has proved to be a problem for frescoes and other works of art in the city for centuries. The city is built on a lagoon in northern Italy. The humidity and the rise of water over the centuries have created a phenomenon known as rising damp. As the lagoon water rises and seeps into the foundation of a building, the water is absorbed and rises up through the walls often causing damage to frescoes. Venetians have become quite adept in the conservation methods of frescoes. The mold aspergillus versicolor can grow after flooding, to consume nutrients from frescoes.

The following is the process that was used when rescuing frescoes in La Fenice, a Venetian opera house, but the same process can be used for similarly damaged frescoes. First, a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol is applied. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses and the wall and pictorial layer were strengthened with barium hydrate. The cracks and detachments are stopped with lime putty and injected with an epoxy resin loaded with micronized silica.

<text>Fire is the rapid oxidation of a fuel in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.
Flames, the most visible portion of the fire, are produced in the combustion reaction when the fuel reaches its ignition point. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. The color and intensity of the flame depend on the type of fuel and composition of the surrounding gases.

Fire, in its most common form, has the potential to result in conflagration, which can lead to permanent physical damage. It impacts ecological systems worldwide. The positive effects of fire include stimulating plant growth and maintaining ecological balance. Its negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. When fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall can cause soil erosion. The burning of vegetation releases nitrogen into the atmosphere, unlike other plant nutrients such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. This loss of nitrogen produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, though it can be recovered by &quot;nitrogen-fixing&quot; plants such as clover, peas, and beans; by decomposition of animal waste and corpses, and by natural phenomena such as lightning.

Fire is one of the four classical elements and has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;fire&quot; comes from Old English and has cognates in many Germanic languages and other Indo-European languages. The Proto-Germanic nominative form is reconstructed as , descending from Proto-Indo-European . An alternative spelling existed in Middle English: ; still preserved in &quot;fiery&quot;.

== History ==

=== Fossil record ===

The fossil record of fire first appears with the establishment of a land-based flora in the Middle Ordovician period, , which contributed large amounts of oxygen to the atmosphere, as the new hordes of land plants pumped it out as a waste product. When this concentration rose above 13%, it permitted the possibility of wildfire. Wildfire is first recorded in the Late Silurian fossil record, , by fossils of charred plants. Apart from a controversial gap in the Late Devonian, charcoal is present ever since. The level of atmospheric oxygen is closely correlated with the amount of charcoal in the fossil record, clearly pointing to oxygen as the key factor in the prevalence of wildfire. Fire also became more abundant when grasses became the dominant component of many ecosystems, around , providing excellent tinder for more rapid spread of fire. This widespread emergence of wildfire may have initiated a positive feedback process, whereby they produced a warmer, drier climate more conducive to fire.

=== Human control ===
The period of history characterized by the influence of human-caused fire activity on Earth has been dubbed the pyrocene. This epoch includes the burning of fossil fuels, especially for technological uses.

==== Early human control ====
The ability to control fire was a dramatic change in the habits of early humans. Making fire to generate heat and light made it possible for people to cook food, simultaneously increasing the variety and availability of nutrients and reducing disease by killing pathogenic microorganisms in the food. The heat produced would also help people stay warm in cold weather, enabling them to live in cooler climates. Fire also kept nocturnal predators at bay. Evidence of occasional cooked food is found from . Although this evidence shows that fire may have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 million years ago, other sources put the date of regular use at 400,000 years ago. Evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago, suggesting regular use from this time; resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a similar point in time. The use of fire became progressively more sophisticated, as it was used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from tens of thousands of years ago.

Fire has also been used for centuries as a method of torture and execution, as evidenced by death by burning as well as torture devices such as the iron boot, which could be heated over an open fire to the agony of the wearer.
By the Neolithic Revolution, during the introduction of grain-based agriculture, people all over the world used fire as a tool in landscape management. These fires were typically controlled burns or &quot;cool fires&quot;, as opposed to uncontrolled &quot;hot fires&quot;, which damage the soil. Hot fires destroy plants and animals, and endanger communities. This is especially a problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops. Cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn. They clear undergrowth, burning up biomass that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense. They provide a greater variety of environments, which encourages game and plant diversity. For humans, they make dense, impassable forests traversable.

Another human use for fire in regards to landscape management is its use to clear land for agriculture. Slash-and-burn agriculture is still common across much of tropical Africa, Asia and South America. For small farmers, controlled fires are a convenient way to clear overgrown areas and release nutrients from standing vegetation back into the soil. However, this useful strategy is also problematic. Growing population, fragmentation of forests and warming climate are making the earth&#x27;s surface more prone to ever-larger escaped fires. These harm ecosystems and human infrastructure, cause health problems, and send up spirals of carbon and soot that may encourage even more warming of the atmosphere – and thus feed back into more fires. Globally today, as much as 5 million square kilometres – an area more than half the size of the United States – burns in a given year.

==== Later human control ====

There are numerous modern applications of fire. In its broadest sense, fire is used by nearly every human being on Earth in a controlled setting every day. Users of internal combustion vehicles employ fire every time they drive. Thermal power stations provide electricity for a large percentage of humanity by igniting fuels such as coal, oil or natural gas, then using the resultant heat to boil water into steam, which then drives turbines.

==== Use in war ====
The use of fire in warfare has a long history. Fire was the basis of all early thermal weapons, including incendiary devices, heated projectiles, and the use of smoke. This class of weapons was particularly evident during naval battles and siege warfare. The Byzantine fleet used Greek fire to attack ships and men.

The invention of gunpowder in China led to the fire lance, a flame-thrower weapon dating to around 1000 CE which was a precursor to projectile weapons driven by burning gunpowder. The earliest modern flamethrowers were used by infantry in the First World War, first used by German troops against entrenched French troops near Verdun in February 1915. They were later successfully mounted on armoured vehicles in the Second World War.

Hand-thrown incendiary bombs improvised from glass bottles, later known as Molotov cocktails, were deployed during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. During that war, incendiary bombs were deployed against Guernica by Fascist Italian and Nazi German air forces that had been created specifically to support Franco&#x27;s Nationalists.

Incendiary bombs were dropped by Axis and Allies during the Second World War, notably on Coventry, Tokyo, Rotterdam, London, Hamburg and Dresden. In the latter two cases, firestorms were deliberately caused in which a ring of fire surrounding each city was drawn inward by an updraft created by a central cluster of fires. The United States Army Air Force extensively used incendiaries against Japanese targets in the latter months of the war, devastating entire cities constructed primarily of wood and paper houses. The incendiary fluid napalm was used in July 1944, towards the end of the Second World War, although its use did not gain public attention until the Vietnam War.

==== Productive use for energy ====

Burning fuel converts chemical energy into heat energy; wood has been used as fuel since prehistory. The International Energy Agency states that nearly 80% of the world&#x27;s power has consistently come from fossil fuels such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal in the past decades. The fire in a power station is used to heat water, creating steam that drives turbines. The turbines then spin an electric generator to produce electricity. Fire is also used to provide mechanical work directly by thermal expansion, in both external and internal combustion engines.

The unburnable solid remains of a combustible material left after a fire is called &quot;clinker&quot; if its melting point is below the flame temperature, so that it fuses and then solidifies as it cools, and &quot;ash&quot; if its melting point is above the flame temperature.

== Physical properties ==

=== Chemistry ===

Fire is a chemical process in which a fuel and an oxidizing agent react, yielding carbon dioxide and water. This process, known as a combustion reaction, does not proceed directly and involves intermediates. Although the oxidizing agent is typically oxygen, other compounds are able to fulfill the role. For instance, chlorine trifluoride is able to ignite sand.

Fires start when a flammable or a combustible material, in combination with a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist, such as chlorine), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, and is able to sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions. For example, a flammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.

Once ignited, a chain reaction must take place whereby fires can sustain their own heat by the further release of heat energy in the process of combustion and may propagate, provided there is a continuous supply of an oxidizer and fuel. If the oxidizer is oxygen from the surrounding air, the presence of a force of gravity, or of some similar force caused by acceleration, is necessary to produce convection, which removes combustion products and brings a supply of oxygen to the fire. Without gravity, a fire rapidly surrounds itself with its own combustion products and non-oxidizing gases from the air, which exclude oxygen and the fire. Because of this, the risk of fire in a spacecraft is small when it is coasting in inertial flight. This does not apply if oxygen is supplied to the fire by some process other than thermal convection.

Fire can be extinguished by removing any one of the elements of the fire tetrahedron. Consider a natural gas flame, such as from a stove-top burner. The fire can be extinguished by any of the following:
* turning off the gas supply, which removes the fuel source;
* covering the flame completely, which smothers the flame as the combustion both uses the available oxidizer (the oxygen in the air) and displaces it from the area around the flame with CO2;
* application of an inert gas such as carbon dioxide, smothering the flame by displacing the available oxidizer;
* application of water, which removes heat from the fire faster than the fire can produce it (similarly, blowing hard on a flame will displace the heat of the currently burning gas from its fuel source, to the same end); or
* application of a retardant chemical such as Halon (largely banned in some countries ) to the flame, which retards the chemical reaction itself until the rate of combustion is too slow to maintain the chain reaction.

In contrast, fire is intensified by increasing the overall rate of combustion. Methods to do this include balancing the input of fuel and oxidizer to stoichiometric proportions, increasing fuel and oxidizer input in this balanced mix, increasing the ambient temperature so the fire&#x27;s own heat is better able to sustain combustion, or providing a catalyst, a non-reactant medium in which the fuel and oxidizer can more readily react.

=== Flame ===


A flame is a mixture of reacting gases and solids emitting visible, infrared, and sometimes ultraviolet light, the frequency spectrum of which depends on the chemical composition of the burning material and intermediate reaction products. In many cases, such as the burning of organic matter, for example wood, or the incomplete combustion of gas, incandescent solid particles called soot produce the familiar red-orange glow of &quot;fire&quot;. This light has a continuous spectrum. Complete combustion of gas has a dim blue color due to the emission of single-wavelength radiation from various electron transitions in the excited molecules formed in the flame. Usually oxygen is involved, but hydrogen burning in chlorine also produces a flame, producing hydrogen chloride (HCl). Other possible combinations producing flames, amongst many, are fluorine and hydrogen, and hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. Hydrogen and hydrazine/UDMH flames are similarly pale blue, while burning boron and its compounds, evaluated in mid-20th century as a high energy fuel for jet and rocket engines, emits intense green flame, leading to its informal nickname of &quot;Green Dragon&quot;.
The glow of a flame is complex. Black-body radiation is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles are too small to behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. Much of the radiation is emitted in the visible and infrared bands. The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra.
The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends to rise to the top of a general flame, as in a candle in normal gravity conditions, making it yellow. In microgravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the CO2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in microgravity, and tends to smother the flame). There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in microgravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions. These discoveries have potential applications in applied science and industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency.

== Fire science ==
Fire science is a branch of physical science which includes fire behavior, dynamics, and combustion. Applications of fire science include fire protection, fire investigation, and wildfire management.

=== Ecology ===
Every natural ecosystem on land has its own fire regime, and the organisms in those ecosystems are adapted to or dependent upon that fire regime. Fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches, each at a different stage of succession. Different species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting a particular stage, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape.

=== Firefighting ===
Fire fighting services are provided in most developed areas to extinguish or contain uncontrolled fires. Trained firefighters use fire apparatus, water supply resources such as water mains and fire hydrants or they might use A and B class foam depending on what is feeding the fire.

The early detection of a wildfire outbreak can be performed by a fire lookout observing from a tower constructed for that purpose. Fire suppression aircraft guided by a lookout can be used to help manage wildfires.

=== Management, prevention and protection systems ===
Controlling a fire to optimize its size, shape, and intensity is generally called &quot;fire management&quot;, and the more advanced forms of it, as traditionally (and sometimes still) practiced by skilled cooks, blacksmiths, ironmasters, and others, are highly skilled activities. They include knowledge of which fuel to burn; how to arrange the fuel; how to stoke the fire both in early phases and in maintenance phases; how to modulate the heat, flame, and smoke as suited to the desired application; how best to bank a fire to be revived later; how to choose, design, or modify stoves, fireplaces, bakery ovens, or industrial furnaces; and so on. Detailed expositions of fire management are available in various books about blacksmithing, about skilled camping or military scouting, and about domestic arts.

Wildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as &quot;wildland fire use&quot; and &quot;prescribed or controlled burns&quot;. &quot;Wildland fire use&quot; refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn. &quot;Controlled burns&quot; are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions.

Fire prevention is intended to reduce sources of ignition. Fire prevention also includes education to teach people how to avoid causing fires. Buildings, especially schools and tall buildings, often conduct fire drills to inform and prepare citizens on how to react to a building fire. Purposely starting destructive fires constitutes arson and is a crime in most jurisdictions.

Model building codes require passive fire protection and active fire protection systems to minimize damage resulting from a fire. A common form of active fire protection is fire sprinklers. To maximize passive fire protection of buildings, building materials and furnishings in most developed countries are tested for fire-resistance, combustibility and flammability. Upholstery, carpeting and plastics used in vehicles and vessels are also tested.

Where fire prevention and fire protection have failed to prevent damage, fire insurance can mitigate the financial impact.

<text>The International Chess Federation or World Chess Federation, commonly referred to by its French acronym FIDE ( , ), is an international organization based in Switzerland that connects the various national chess federations and acts as the governing body of international chess competition. FIDE was founded in Paris, France, in 1924. Its motto is , Latin for &#x27;We are one Family&#x27;. In 1999, FIDE was recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). there are 201 member federations of FIDE. The current world chess champion is Gukesh Dommaraju.

==Role==
FIDE&#x27;s most visible activity is organizing the World Chess Championship since 1948. FIDE also organizes world championships for women, juniors, seniors, and the disabled, as well the world championships for the shorter time formats rapid and blitz. Another flagship event is the Chess Olympiad, a biennial chess tournament organized since 1924, in which national teams compete. In alternate years, FIDE also organizes the World Team Championship, in which the best teams from the previous Olympiad compete.

As part of the World Chess Championship cycle, FIDE also organizes the Candidates Tournament, which determines who will challenge the reigning World Champion, and the qualifying tournaments for the Candidates, such as the Chess World Cup, the FIDE Grand Prix, and the FIDE Grand Swiss Tournament 2019.

FIDE is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the supreme body responsible for the organization of chess and its championships at global and continental levels. Other tournaments are not overseen directly by FIDE, but they generally observe FIDE rules and regulations. Some national chess organizations such as the US Chess Federation use minor differences to FIDE rules.

FIDE defines the rules of chess, both for individual games (i.e. the board and moves) and for the conduct of international competitions. The international competition rules are the basis for local competitions, although local bodies are allowed to modify these rules to a certain extent. FIDE awards a number of organizational titles, including International Arbiter, which signifies that the recipient is competent and trusted to oversee top-class competitions.

FIDE calculates the Elo ratings of players and awards titles for achievement in competitive play, such as the Grandmaster title. It also awards titles to composers and solvers of chess problems and studies.

FIDE funds and manages outreach programs, such as the Chess for Freedom program and awards such as, since 2020, the Svetozar Gligoric Award for fair play.

Correspondence chess (chess played by post, email or on online servers) is regulated by the International Correspondence Chess Federation, an independent body that cooperates with FIDE where appropriate.

The FIDE budget for 2022 was , an increase from the 2021 budget which was . Income is primarily from rights to tournaments such as the Olympiad and World Championship, from various fees and commissions, and from corporate sponsorship and donations.

==History==
===Foundation and early years (up to 1939)===
In 1904, L&#x27;union Amicale, a French chess association, attempted to establish an international chess federation. In April 1914, an initiative was taken in St. Petersburg, Russia, to form an international chess federation. Another attempt was made in July 1914 during the Mannheim International Chess Tournament. Further efforts temporarily came to an end as a result of the outbreak of World War I. In 1920, another attempt to organize an international federation was made at the Gothenburg Tournament.

Players made the first attempt to produce rules for world championship matches—in 1922, world champion José Raúl Capablanca proposed the &quot;London rules&quot;: the first player to win six games outright would win the match; playing sessions would be limited to five hours; the time limit would be 40 moves in 2.5 hours each; the champion would be obliged to defend his title within one year of receiving a challenge from a recognized master; the champion would decide the date of the match; the champion was not obliged to accept a challenge for a purse of less than $10,000 (); 20% of the purse was to be paid to the title holder, with the remainder being divided, 60 percent to the winner of the match, and 40% to the loser; the highest purse bid must be accepted. Alekhine, Bogoljubov, Maróczy, Réti, Rubinstein, Tartakower and Vidmar promptly signed them. The only match played under those rules was Capablanca vs Alekhine in 1927.

In 1922, the Russian master Eugene Znosko-Borovsky, while participating in an international tournament in London, announced that a tournament would be held during the 8th Sports Olympic Games in Paris in 1924 and would be hosted by the French Chess Federation. On July 20, 1924, the participants at the Paris tournament founded FIDE as a kind of players&#x27; union. In its early years, FIDE had little power, and it was poorly financed.

FIDE&#x27;s congresses in 1925 and 1926 expressed a desire to become involved in managing the world championship. FIDE was largely happy with the &quot;London Rules&quot;, but claimed that the requirement for a purse of $10,000 was impracticable and called upon Capablanca to come to an agreement with the leading masters to revise the Rules.

FIDE&#x27;s third congress, in Budapest in 1926, also decided to organize a Chess Olympiad. The invitations were, however, late in being sent, with the result that only four countries participated, and the competition was called the Little Olympiad. The winner was Hungary, followed by Yugoslavia, Romania, and Germany. In 1927, FIDE began organizing the First Chess Olympiad during its 4th Congress in London. The official title of the tournament was the &quot;Tournament of Nations&quot;, or &quot;World Team Championship&quot;, but &quot;Chess Olympiad&quot; became a more popular title. The event was won by Hungary, with 16 teams competing.

In 1928, FIDE recognized Bogoljubow as &quot;Champion of FIDE&quot; after he won a match against Max Euwe. Alekhine, the reigning world champion, attended part of the 1928 Congress and agreed to place future matches for the world title under the auspices of FIDE, although any match with Capablanca should be under the same conditions as in Buenos Aires, 1927, i.e., including the requirement for a purse of at least $10,000. FIDE accepted this and decided to form a commission to modify the London Rules for future matches, though this commission never met; by the time of the 1929 Congress, a world championship match between Alekhine and Bogoljubow was under way, held neither under the auspices of FIDE nor in accordance with the London Rules.

While negotiating his 1937 World Championship re-match with Alekhine, Euwe proposed that if he retained the title, FIDE should manage the nomination of future challengers and the conduct of championship matches. FIDE had been trying since 1935 to introduce rules on how to select challengers, and its various proposals favored selection by some sort of committee. While they were debating procedures in 1937 and Alekhine and Euwe were preparing for their re-match later that year, the Dutch Chess Federation proposed that a super-tournament (AVRO) of ex-champions and rising stars should be held to select the next challenger. FIDE rejected this proposal and at their second attempt nominated Salo Flohr as the official challenger. Euwe then declared that: if he retained his title against Alekhine he was prepared to meet Flohr in 1940 but he reserved the right to arrange a title match either in 1938 or 1939 with José Raúl Capablanca, who had lost the title to Alekhine in 1927; if Euwe lost his title to Capablanca then FIDE&#x27;s decision should be followed and Capablanca would have to play Flohr in 1940. Most chess writers and players strongly supported the Dutch super-tournament proposal and opposed the committee processes favored by FIDE. While this confusion went unresolved: Euwe lost his title to Alekhine; the AVRO tournament in 1938 was won by Paul Keres under a tie-breaking rule, with Reuben Fine placed second and Capablanca and Flohr in the bottom places; and the outbreak of World War II in 1939 cut short the controversy. Although competitive chess continued in many countries, including some that were under Nazi occupation, there was no international competition and FIDE was inactive during the war.

===1946 to 1993===

====Birth of the World Championship challenge cycle====
From the time of Emanuel Lasker&#x27;s defeat of Wilhelm Steinitz in 1894, until 1946, a new World Champion had won the title by defeating the former champion in a match. Alexander Alekhine&#x27;s death created an &quot;interregnum&quot; that made the normal procedure impossible. The situation was confused, with many respected players and commentators offering different solutions. FIDE found it difficult to organize the early discussions on how to resolve the &quot;interregnum&quot;, because problems with money and travel in the aftermath of World War II prevented many countries from sending representatives, most notably the Soviet Union. The shortage of clear information resulted in otherwise responsible magazines publishing rumors and speculation, which only made the situation more confused. See Interregnum of World Chess Champions for more details.

This situation was exacerbated by the Soviet Union having long refused to join FIDE, and by this time it was clear that about half the credible contenders were Soviet citizens. The Soviet Union realized, however, it could not afford to be left out of the discussions regarding the vacant world championship, and in 1947 sent a telegram apologizing for the absence of Soviet representatives and requesting that the USSR be represented in future FIDE Committees.

The eventual solution was similar to FIDE&#x27;s initial proposal and to a proposal put forward by the Soviet Union (authored by Mikhail Botvinnik). The 1938 AVRO tournament was used as the basis for the 1948 Championship Tournament. The AVRO tournament had brought together the eight players who were, by general acclamation, the best players in the world at the time. Two of the participants at AVRO—Alekhine and former world champion Capablanca—had since died; but FIDE decided that the other six participants at AVRO would play a quadruple round-robin tournament. These players were: Max Euwe (from The Netherlands); Botvinnik, Paul Keres and Salo Flohr (from the Soviet Union); and Reuben Fine and Samuel Reshevsky (from the United States). FIDE soon accepted a Soviet request to substitute Vasily Smyslov for Flohr, and Fine withdrew in order to continue his degree studies in psychiatry, so five players competed, in a quintuple round robin. Botvinnik won, thus becoming world champion, ending the &quot;interregnum&quot;.

The proposals which led to the 1948 Championship Tournament also specified the procedure by which challengers for the World Championship would be selected in a three-year cycle: countries affiliated with FIDE would send players to Zonal tournaments (the number varied depending on the number of strong players each country had); the players who gained the top places in these would compete in an Interzonal tournament (later split into two, then three tournaments as the number of countries and eligible players increased); the highest-placed players from the Interzonal would compete in the Candidates Tournament, along with the loser of the previous title match and the runner-up in the previous Candidates Tournament; and the winner of the Candidates played a title match against the champion. From 1950 until 1962 inclusive, the Candidates Tournament was a multi-round round-robin—how and why it was changed are described below.

====Bobby Fischer controversies====
FIDE found itself embroiled in some controversies relating to the American player Bobby Fischer. The first controversy took place when Fischer alleged that, at the 1962 Candidates Tournament in Curaçao, the Soviet players Tigran Petrosian, Paul Keres and Efim Geller had pre-arranged draws in their games played amongst themselves, and that Viktor Korchnoi, another Soviet player, had been instructed to lose to them (Fischer had placed 4th, well behind Petrosian, Keres and Geller). Grandmaster Yuri Averbakh, a member of the Soviet delegation at the tournament, confirmed in 2002 that Petrosian, Keres and Geller privately agreed to draw their games. FIDE responded by changing the format of Candidates Tournaments from a multi-round round-robin to a series of elimination matches, initially 10–12 games in duration; however, by the 1970s, the Candidates final would be as long as 24 games.

Then, in 1969, Fischer refused to play in the U.S. Championship because of disagreements about the tournament&#x27;s format and prize fund. Since that event was being treated as a Zonal tournament, Fischer forfeited his right to compete for the right to challenge World Champion Boris Spassky in 1972. Grandmaster Pal Benko agreed to relinquish his qualifying place at the Interzonal in Fischer&#x27;s favor, and the other participants waived their right to claim the spot. FIDE president Max Euwe interpreted the rules very flexibly to allow Fischer to play in the 1970 Interzonal at Palma de Mallorca, which he won convincingly. Fischer then crushed Mark Taimanov, Bent Larsen (both 6–0) and Tigran Petrosian in the 1971 Candidates
Tournament and won the title match with Spassky to become world champion.

After winning the world championship, Fischer criticized the existing championship match format (24 games; the champion retained the title if the match was tied) on the grounds that it encouraged whoever got an early lead to play for draws. While this dispute was going on, Anatoly Karpov won the right to challenge in 1975. Fischer refused to accept any match format other than the one he proposed. Among Fischer&#x27;s demands was a requirement that the challenger must beat him by at least two games in order to take his title (Fischer proposed a match format in which the first player to win 10 games wins, with draws not counting, but if the result is 9–9 it is considered a tie). The FIDE argued that it was unfair for a challenger to be able to beat the world champion, yet not take his title. Fischer would not back down, and eventually FIDE awarded the title to Karpov by default. Some commentators have questioned whether FIDE president Max Euwe did as much as he could have to prevent Fischer from forfeiting his world title.

====Other 1970s controversies====
FIDE had a number of conflicts with the Soviet Chess Federation. These conflicts included:
* The defection of grandmaster Gennadi Sosonko in 1972. The Soviets demanded that Sosonko be excluded from competitive chess, television or any other event that might publicize his defection. FIDE refused, and no Soviet players took part in the 1974 Wijk aan Zee tournament in The Netherlands because Sosonko was playing in it.
* In 1976 world championship contender Viktor Korchnoi sought political asylum in The Netherlands. In a discussion a few days earlier Euwe told Korchnoi, &quot;...of course you will retain all your rights...&quot; and later opposed Soviet efforts to prevent Korchnoi from challenging for Anatoly Karpov&#x27;s title in 1978.
* FIDE decided to hold the 1976 Chess Olympiad in Israel despite the Soviet Chess Federation announced its boycott of Israel as the site of the Olympiad and the congress because of what it described as Israeli aggression against Arab states.

====Rapid expansion of membership====
During his period as president of FIDE (1970–1978) Max Euwe strove to increase the number of member countries, and Florencio Campomanes (president 1982–1995) continued this policy, with each member nation receiving one vote. Former world champion Anatoly Karpov later said this was a mixed blessing, as the inclusion of so many small, poor countries led to a &quot;leadership vacuum at the head of the world of chess...&quot; Yuri Averbakh said the presence of so many weak countries made it easy to manipulate decisions.

====World Championship, 1983–1985====
The events leading to Garry Kasparov&#x27;s winning the world championship involved FIDE in two controversies. While arranging the Candidates Tournament semi-final matches to be played in 1983, FIDE accepted bids to host Kasparov versus Victor Korchnoi in Pasadena, California. The Soviet Union refused to accept this, either because it feared Kasparov would defect or because it thought Kasparov was the greater threat to reigning champion Anatoly Karpov. Their refusal would have meant that Kasparov forfeited his chance of challenging for the title. FIDE president Florencio Campomanes negotiated with the Soviet Union, and the match was played in London.

In the 1984 world championship match between Karpov and Kasparov the winner was to be the first to win six games. In the first 27 games Karpov gained a 5–0 lead but by the end of the 48th Kasparov had reduced this to 5–3. At this point the match had lasted for 159 days (from September 1984 to February 1985). Then the match was ended without result by Florencio Campomanes, the President of the World Chess Federation, and a new match was announced to start a few months later. The termination was controversial, as both players stated that they preferred the match to continue. Announcing his decision at a press conference, Campomanes cited the health of the players, which had been strained by the length of the match. Kasparov won the second match and became world champion.
===1993 to 2018===

====World Championship divided, 1993–2006====
In 1992, Nigel Short emerged as the official challenger for Kasparov&#x27;s world title after winning the Candidates Tournament. FIDE promptly accepted a bid from Manchester, England, to host the 1993 title match, but without consulting Short, as its rules required; Short was traveling to Greece at the time. Upon learning of this, Short reached out to Kasparov, who had harbored distrust for FIDE and its president, Florencio Campomanes, since the abrupt end of his 1984 title match against Anatoly Karpov. Kasparov and Short concluded that FIDE had not secured the best financial deal for them and announced their decision to play under a new organization, the Professional Chess Association (PCA). In response, FIDE stripped Kasparov of his title, removed both Kasparov and Short from the official rating list, and announced a title match between Karpov and Jan Timman, whom Short had defeated in the Candidates Tournament. Both Kasparov and Karpov won their respective matches, both claiming the title of world champion.

By 1994, Kasparov realized that separating from FIDE had been a mistake, as the split in the world championship was unpopular among commercial sponsors and most grandmasters. He began efforts to mend relations with FIDE and supported Campomanes&#x27;s re-election bid as FIDE president. However, many FIDE delegates viewed Campomanes as corrupt, and he agreed to resign in 1995, provided his successor was Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of the Republic of Kalmykia.

Several attempts to reunify the world championship in the following years failed for various reasons, including financial constraints and Kasparov&#x27;s opposition to any plan requiring him to play in a qualifying series. In 2000, Vladimir Kramnik defeated Kasparov in a match for the now-renamed Braingames World Chess Championship, as the PCA had dissolved by then. Kramnik, like Kasparov, was unwilling to play in a qualifying series and strongly objected to FIDE&#x27;s attempt to decide the world championship through annual knockout tournaments and to shorten game time limits.

In 2006, a reunification match was held between Kramnik and Veselin Topalov, which Kramnik won amidst a controversy that resulted in one game being awarded to Topalov. However, the split in the world title had lingering effects, as evidenced by FIDE&#x27;s complex regulations for the 2007-2009 world championship cycle. FIDE decided to grant Topalov a &quot;fast track&quot; entry into the 2007-2009 cycle due to his inability to compete in the 2007 World Chess Championship Tournament. Additionally, FIDE decided that if Kramnik did not win the 2007 championship tournament, he would play a championship match in 2008 against the winner. This provision came into effect when Viswanathan Anand won the tournament and became the world champion.

====IOC recognition====
In 1999, FIDE was recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Two years later, it introduced the IOC&#x27;s anti-drugs rules to chess, as part of its campaign for chess to become part of the Olympic Games.
====Commercial agreement with Agon and World Chess==== 

In 2012 FIDE entered into a commercial agreement, initially planned to last until 2021, with the company Agon Limited. This company was given rights to organize and commercially exploit the World Chess Championship and the associated events in the World Championship cycle. The first tournament it organized was the London FIDE Grand Prix event in September 2012, followed by the London Candidates Tournament in March 2013, and the Chennai World Chess Championship in November 2013.

Agon subsequently organized the four events in the FIDE Grand Prix 2014–15, the Candidates Tournament in 2014, and the World Chess Championship in 2014.

Agon had been founded in 2012 in Jersey by Andrew Paulson as the sole shareholder. On February 20, 2012, an agreement between Agon and FIDE was made, subject to approval by the 2012 FIDE General Assembly. This approval was forthcoming in September 2012. In October 2014, Agon was sold to its current CEO Ilya Merenzon for the sum of one pound. At the September 2016 FIDE General Assembly, it was resolved that Agon should institute a corporate presence in a locale with more transparency. Merenzon said that they would register in the United Kingdom within a few months. As a result, a new company, World Chess Limited, was registered shortly after, replacing Agon as the rights holder in the agreement with FIDE.

====FIDE and Agon/World Chess contract controversy====

Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was happy with the agreement on the basis that now FIDE itself did not have to expend resources to find organizers for its premier events. The issue of financial guarantees was also important, though as explained below, these have not always materialized. His estimation of 10–12 million euros to FIDE from the coming cycles has not yet come to fruition either.

The condition that Agon would be the sole organizer of Championship events was disputed originally by principally the Bulgarian Chess Federation, with respect to the Candidates matches for 2012. In early 2014, a purported agreement between Paulson and FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was leaked, and then published by Chess.com (and others), which allegedly indicated that Paulson was simply a front man with Ilyumzhinov the ultimate benefactor of Agon. In that Chess.com article Malcolm Pein is quoted as having twice been told by Paulson that Ilyuzmhinov owned Agon, and in a &quot;New In Chess&quot; article Nigel Short asserted he had also been told this personally by Paulson. In response, FIDE&#x27;s deputy vice president Georgios Makropoulos pointed out that the purported contract was a draft document. The FIDE Ethics Commission ruled in September 2015 that Ilyumzhinov did not violate the FIDE Code of Ethics.

===2018 to present===
====The election of Arkady Dvorkovich and the end of the Ilyumzhinov era====

In July 2018, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was ousted as FIDE President, after having been in office for 23 years, since 1995. Being subjected to US sanctions for his business dealings with the Syrian government, Ilyumzhinov was forced out and did not run for re-election in the 2018 FIDE elections. The Greek Georgios Makropoulos, who had been General Secretary since 1990 and number two in the organization under Kirsan&#x27;s presidency, was the first to announce his ticket. He was followed by the Englishman Nigel Short, a world title contender in the World Chess Championship 1993 against Garry Kasparov. The last to announce his candidacy was Arkady Dvorkovich, an economist who had served as Russian deputy prime minister and was also a member of the supervisory board of the Russian Chess Federation. Dvorkovich was also one of the chief organizers of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Dvorkovich was placed in the US Treasury pre-sanctions list in 2018 as a top Russian government employee.

In the elections, held in Batumi (Georgia) in October 2018, Dvorkovich won by 103 votes to 78 against Makropoulos, after Nigel Short withdrew his candidacy at the last minute and expressed his support to the Russian candidate.

After the 2018 FIDE elections and the appointment of a new FIDE President, the new management took regaining control over the World Championship cycle as one of their top priorities. In January 2019, FIDE Director-General Emil Sutovsky announced that a new contract has been signed that continues a scaled-back relationship with World Chess (formerly known as AGON) through 2021. In virtue of this new agreement, FIDE reasserted control over the 2020 Candidates and the World Championship match, which from now on will undergo an open bidding procedure. Agon/World Chess only retained organizational and commercial rights over the FIDE Grand Prix Series, limited until 2021.

At FIDE&#x27;s general assembly in Chennai, India, in August 2022 Dvorkovich got re-elected by 157 votes to 16 against Ukraine&#x27;s Andrii Baryshpolets.

====Reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine====
On February 27, 2022, FIDE issued an official statement condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As a consequence, Russia and Belarus were forbidden from hosting official FIDE events. The decision to hold the 2022 Chess Olympiad and the 2022 FIDE congress in Moscow was also revoked. The Russian and Belarusian national teams were banned from participating in FIDE tournaments, although individual players could compete if they complied with strict regulations, in which case their federation and flag was replaced with FIDE and its banner.

On March 22, 2022, FIDE decided to issue a six-month ban from competing in rated tournaments against Russian grandmaster Sergey Karjakin. Karjakin had posted controversial statements on Twitter in which he declared his support for the invasion of Ukraine and for President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s characterization of the war as a fight against Nazism. FIDE argued that Karjakin&#x27;s statements had shed a negative light on chess and on the federation and found that he had violated the FIDE code of ethics. Sergei Shipov, who also publicly commented in favor of Russia, was not sanctioned, because FIDE decided that his statements were less provocative.

==== Policy on transgender players ====

In August 2023, FIDE ruled that transgender women would be excluded from women&#x27;s tournaments organised by them, such as the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship, the Women&#x27;s Chess World Cup, and qualification events for these. Additionally, they implemented rules stripping transgender men of any women&#x27;s titles they might have earned while competing as women. The regulation affects those who changed their gender identity after being assigned a FIDE identification number.

The French Chess Federation announced that they would not implement any restrictions on transgender players, considering the FIDE decision transphobic. A little later, the German Chess Federation said in a statement that they do not exclude transgender women from women&#x27;s tournaments, and made reference to Annemarie Sylvia Meier, a transgender woman who won the 2003 German Women&#x27;s Chess Championship. They also said that no one should have to experience violence and discrimination. Similar statements were also released by the English, Finnish and US chess federations.

Since the announcement, French transgender player Yosha Iglesias has competed as a woman and been awarded the Woman International Master title.

<text>The Fresnel equations (or Fresnel coefficients) describe the reflection and transmission of light (or electromagnetic radiation in general) when incident on an interface between different optical media. They were deduced by French engineer and physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel () who was the first to understand that light is a transverse wave, when no one realized that the waves were electric and magnetic fields. For the first time, polarization could be understood quantitatively, as Fresnel&#x27;s equations correctly predicted the differing behaviour of waves of the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; polarizations incident upon a material interface.

== Overview ==
When light strikes the interface between a medium with refractive index and a second medium with refractive index , both reflection and refraction of the light may occur. The Fresnel equations give the ratio of the &quot;reflected&quot; wave&#x27;s electric field to the incident wave&#x27;s electric field, and the ratio of the &quot;transmitted&quot; wave&#x27;s electric field to the incident wave&#x27;s electric field, for each of two components of polarization. (The &quot;magnetic&quot; fields can also be related using similar coefficients.) These ratios are generally complex, describing not only the relative amplitudes but also the phase shifts at the interface.

The equations assume the interface between the media is flat and that the media are homogeneous and isotropic. The incident light is assumed to be a plane wave, which is sufficient to solve any problem since any incident light field can be decomposed into plane waves and polarizations.

=== S and P polarizations ===
There are two sets of Fresnel coefficients for two different linear polarization components of the incident wave. Since any polarization state can be resolved into a combination of two orthogonal linear polarizations, this is sufficient for any problem. Likewise, unpolarized (or &quot;randomly polarized&quot;) light has an equal amount of power in each of two linear polarizations.

The s polarization refers to polarization of a wave&#x27;s electric field &quot;normal&quot; to the plane of incidence (the direction in the derivation below); then the magnetic field is &quot;in&quot; the plane of incidence. The p polarization refers to polarization of the electric field &quot;in&quot; the plane of incidence (the plane in the derivation below); then the magnetic field is &quot;normal&quot; to the plane of incidence. The names &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; for the polarization components refer to German &quot;senkrecht&quot; (perpendicular or normal) and &quot;parallel&quot; (parallel to the plane of incidence).

Although the reflection and transmission are dependent on polarization, at normal incidence () there is no distinction between them so all polarization states are governed by a single set of Fresnel coefficients (and another special case is mentioned below in which that is true).

== Configuration ==

In the diagram on the right, an incident plane wave in the direction of the ray strikes the interface between two media of refractive indices and at point . Part of the wave is reflected in the direction , and part refracted in the direction . The angles that the incident, reflected and refracted rays make to the normal of the interface are given as , and , respectively.
The relationship between these angles is given by the law of reflection:
formula_1
and Snell&#x27;s law:
formula_2

The behavior of light striking the interface is explained by considering the electric and magnetic fields that constitute an electromagnetic wave, and the laws of electromagnetism, as shown below. The ratio of waves&#x27; electric field (or magnetic field) amplitudes are obtained, but in practice one is more often interested in formulae which determine &quot;power&quot; coefficients, since power (or irradiance) is what can be directly measured at optical frequencies. The power of a wave is generally proportional to the square of the electric (or magnetic) field amplitude.

== Power (intensity) reflection and transmission coefficients ==

We call the fraction of the incident power that is reflected from the interface the &quot;reflectance&quot; (or reflectivity, or power reflection coefficient) , and the fraction that is refracted into the second medium is called the &quot;transmittance&quot; (or transmissivity, or power transmission coefficient) . Note that these are what would be measured right &quot;at&quot; each side of an interface and do not account for attenuation of a wave in an absorbing medium &quot;following&quot; transmission or reflection.

The reflectance for s-polarized light is

formula_3
while the reflectance for p-polarized light is

formula_4
where and are the wave impedances of media 1 and 2, respectively.

We assume that the media are non-magnetic (i.e., ), which is typically a good approximation at optical frequencies (and for transparent media at other frequencies). Then the wave impedances are determined solely by the refractive indices and :
formula_5
where is the impedance of free space and . Making this substitution, we obtain equations using the refractive indices:
formula_6
formula_7

The second form of each equation is derived from the first by eliminating using Snell&#x27;s law and trigonometric identities.

As a consequence of conservation of energy, one can find the transmitted power (or more correctly, irradiance: power per unit area) simply as the portion of the incident power that isn&#x27;t reflected:
formula_8
and
formula_9

Note that all such intensities are measured in terms of a wave&#x27;s irradiance in the direction normal to the interface; this is also what is measured in typical experiments. That number could be obtained from irradiances &quot;in the direction of an incident or reflected wave&quot; (given by the magnitude of a wave&#x27;s Poynting vector) multiplied by for a wave at an angle to the normal direction (or equivalently, taking the dot product of the Poynting vector with the unit vector normal to the interface). This complication can be ignored in the case of the reflection coefficient, since , so that the ratio of reflected to incident irradiance in the wave&#x27;s direction is the same as in the direction normal to the interface.

Although these relationships describe the basic physics, in many practical applications one is concerned with &quot;natural light&quot; that can be described as unpolarized. That means that there is an equal amount of power in the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; polarizations, so that the &quot;effective&quot; reflectivity of the material is just the average of the two reflectivities:
formula_10

For low-precision applications involving unpolarized light, such as computer graphics, rather than rigorously computing the effective reflection coefficient for each angle, Schlick&#x27;s approximation is often used.

=== Special cases ===
==== Normal incidence ====
For the case of normal incidence, , and there is no distinction between s and p polarization. Thus, the reflectance simplifies to
formula_11

For common glass () surrounded by air (), the power reflectance at normal incidence can be seen to be about 4%, or 8% accounting for both sides of a glass pane.

==== Brewster&#x27;s angle ====

At a dielectric interface from to , there is a particular angle of incidence at which goes to zero and a p-polarised incident wave is purely refracted, thus all reflected light is s-polarised. This angle is known as Brewster&#x27;s angle, and is around 56° for and (typical glass).

==== Total internal reflection ====

When light travelling in a denser medium strikes the surface of a less dense medium (i.e., ), beyond a particular incidence angle known as the &quot;critical angle&quot;, all light is reflected and . This phenomenon, known as total internal reflection, occurs at incidence angles for which Snell&#x27;s law predicts that the sine of the angle of refraction would exceed unity (whereas in fact for all real ). For glass with surrounded by air, the critical angle is approximately 42°.

==== 45° incidence ====
Reflection at 45° incidence is very commonly used for making 90° turns. For the case of light traversing from a less dense medium into a denser one at 45° incidence (), it follows algebraically from the above equations that equals the square of :
formula_12

This can be used to either verify the consistency of the measurements of and , or to derive one of them when the other is known. This relationship is only valid for the simple case of a single plane interface between two homogeneous materials, not for films on substrates, where a more complex analysis is required.

Measurements of and at 45° can be used to estimate the reflectivity at normal incidence. The &quot;average of averages&quot; obtained by calculating first the arithmetic as well as the geometric average of and , and then averaging these two averages again arithmetically, gives a value for with an error of less than about 3% for most common optical materials. This is useful because measurements at normal incidence can be difficult to achieve in an experimental setup since the incoming beam and the detector will obstruct each other. However, since the dependence of and on the angle of incidence for angles below 10° is very small, a measurement at about 5° will usually be a good approximation for normal incidence, while allowing for a separation of the incoming and reflected beam.

== Complex amplitude reflection and transmission coefficients ==
The above equations relating powers (which could be measured with a photometer for instance) are derived from the Fresnel equations which solve the physical problem in terms of electromagnetic field complex amplitudes, i.e., considering phase shifts in addition to their amplitudes. Those underlying equations supply generally complex-valued ratios of those EM fields and may take several different forms, depending on the formalism used. The complex amplitude coefficients for reflection and transmission are usually represented by lower case and (whereas the power coefficients are capitalized). As before, we are assuming the magnetic permeability, of both media to be equal to the permeability of free space as is essentially true of all dielectrics at optical frequencies.

In the following equations and graphs, we adopt the following conventions. For &quot;s&quot; polarization, the reflection coefficient is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave&#x27;s complex electric field amplitude to that of the incident wave, whereas for &quot;p&quot; polarization is the ratio of the waves complex &quot;magnetic&quot; field amplitudes (or equivalently, the &quot;negative&quot; of the ratio of their electric field amplitudes). The transmission coefficient is the ratio of the transmitted wave&#x27;s complex electric field amplitude to that of the incident wave, for either polarization. The coefficients and are generally different between the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; polarizations, and even at normal incidence (where the designations &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; do not even apply!) the sign of is reversed depending on whether the wave is considered to be &quot;s&quot; or &quot;p&quot; polarized, an artifact of the adopted sign convention (see graph for an air-glass interface at 0° incidence).

The equations consider a plane wave incident on a plane interface at angle of incidence , a wave reflected at angle , and a wave transmitted at angle . In the case of an interface into an absorbing material (where is complex) or total internal reflection, the angle of transmission does not generally evaluate to a real number. In that case, however, meaningful results can be obtained using formulations of these relationships in which trigonometric functions and geometric angles are avoided; the inhomogeneous waves launched into the second medium cannot be described using a single propagation angle.

Using this convention,

formula_13
One can see that and . One can write very similar equations applying to the ratio of the waves&#x27; magnetic fields, but comparison of the electric fields is more conventional.

Because the reflected and incident waves propagate in the same medium and make the same angle with the normal to the surface, the power reflection coefficient is just the squared magnitude of :
formula_14

On the other hand, calculation of the power transmission coefficient is less straightforward, since the light travels in different directions in the two media. What&#x27;s more, the wave impedances in the two media differ; power (irradiance) is given by the square of the electric field amplitude &quot;divided by&quot; the characteristic impedance of the medium (or by the square of the magnetic field &quot;multiplied by&quot; the characteristic impedance). This results in:
formula_15
using the above definition of . The introduced factor of is the reciprocal of the ratio of the media&#x27;s wave impedances. The factors adjust the waves&#x27; powers so they are reckoned &quot;in the direction&quot; normal to the interface, for both the incident and transmitted waves, so that full power transmission corresponds to .

In the case of total internal reflection where the power transmission is zero, nevertheless describes the electric field (including its phase) just beyond the interface. This is an evanescent field which does not propagate as a wave (thus ) but has nonzero values very close to the interface. The phase shift of the reflected wave on total internal reflection can similarly be obtained from the phase angles of and (whose magnitudes are unity in this case). These phase shifts are different for &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; waves, which is the well-known principle by which total internal reflection is used to effect polarization transformations.

=== Alternative forms ===

In the above formula for , if we put formula_16 (Snell&#x27;s law) and multiply the numerator and denominator by , we obtain
formula_17

If we do likewise with the formula for , the result is easily shown to be equivalent to
formula_18

These formulas are known respectively as &quot;Fresnel&#x27;s sine law&quot; and &quot;Fresnel&#x27;s tangent law&quot;. Although at normal incidence these expressions reduce to 0/0, one can see that they yield the correct results in the limit as .

== Multiple surfaces ==
When light makes multiple reflections between two or more parallel surfaces, the multiple beams of light generally interfere with one another, resulting in net transmission and reflection amplitudes that depend on the light&#x27;s wavelength. The interference, however, is seen only when the surfaces are at distances comparable to or smaller than the light&#x27;s coherence length, which for ordinary white light is few micrometers; it can be much larger for light from a laser.

An example of interference between reflections is the iridescent colours seen in a soap bubble or in thin oil films on water. Applications include Fabry–Pérot interferometers, antireflection coatings, and optical filters. A quantitative analysis of these effects is based on the Fresnel equations, but with additional calculations to account for interference.

The transfer-matrix method, or the recursive Rouard method can be used to solve multiple-surface problems.

== History ==
In 1808, Étienne-Louis Malus discovered that when a ray of light was reflected off a non-metallic surface at the appropriate angle, it behaved like &quot;one&quot; of the two rays emerging from a doubly-refractive calcite crystal. He later coined the term &quot;polarization&quot; to describe this behavior.  In 1815, the dependence of the polarizing angle on the refractive index was determined experimentally by David Brewster. But the &quot;reason&quot; for that dependence was such a deep mystery that in late 1817, Thomas Young was moved to write:

In 1821, however, Augustin-Jean Fresnel derived results equivalent to his sine and tangent laws (above), by modeling light waves as transverse elastic waves with vibrations perpendicular to what had previously been called the plane of polarization. Fresnel promptly confirmed by experiment that the equations correctly predicted the direction of polarization of the reflected beam when the incident beam was polarized at 45° to the plane of incidence, for light incident from air onto glass or water; in particular, the equations gave the correct polarization at Brewster&#x27;s angle. The experimental confirmation was reported in a &quot;postscript&quot; to the work in which Fresnel first revealed his theory that light waves, including &quot;unpolarized&quot; waves, were &quot;purely&quot; transverse.

Details of Fresnel&#x27;s derivation, including the modern forms of the sine law and tangent law, were given later, in a memoir read to the French Academy of Sciences in January 1823. That derivation combined conservation of energy with continuity of the &quot;tangential&quot; vibration at the interface, but failed to allow for any condition on the &quot;normal&quot; component of vibration. The first derivation from &quot;electromagnetic&quot; principles was given by Hendrik Lorentz in 1875.

In the same memoir of January 1823, Fresnel found that for angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, his formulas for the reflection coefficients ( and ) gave complex values with unit magnitudes. Noting that the magnitude, as usual, represented the ratio of peak amplitudes, he guessed that the argument represented the phase shift, and verified the hypothesis experimentally. The verification involved
* calculating the angle of incidence that would introduce a total phase difference of 90° between the s and p components, for various numbers of total internal reflections at that angle (generally there were two solutions),
* subjecting light to that number of total internal reflections at that angle of incidence, with an initial linear polarization at 45° to the plane of incidence, and
* checking that the final polarization was circular.
Thus he finally had a quantitative theory for what we now call the &quot;Fresnel rhomb&quot; — a device that he had been using in experiments, in one form or another, since 1817 (see &quot;Fresnel rhomb §History&quot;).

The success of the complex reflection coefficient inspired James MacCullagh and Augustin-Louis Cauchy, beginning in 1836, to analyze reflection from metals by using the Fresnel equations with a complex refractive index.

Four weeks before he presented his completed theory of total internal reflection and the rhomb, Fresnel submitted a memoir in which he introduced the needed terms &quot;linear polarization&quot;, &quot;circular polarization&quot;, and &quot;elliptical polarization&quot;, and in which he explained optical rotation as a species of birefringence: linearly-polarized light can be resolved into two circularly-polarized components rotating in opposite directions, and if these propagate at different speeds, the phase difference between them — hence the orientation of their linearly-polarized resultant — will vary continuously with distance.

Thus Fresnel&#x27;s interpretation of the complex values of his reflection coefficients marked the confluence of several streams of his research and, arguably, the essential completion of his reconstruction of physical optics on the transverse-wave hypothesis (see &quot;Augustin-Jean Fresnel&quot;).

== Derivation ==
Here we systematically derive the above relations from electromagnetic premises.

=== Material parameters ===
In order to compute meaningful Fresnel coefficients, we must assume that the medium is (approximately) linear and homogeneous. If the medium is also isotropic, the four field vectors are related by
formula_19
where and are scalars, known respectively as the (electric) &quot;permittivity&quot; and the (magnetic) &quot;permeability&quot; of the medium. For vacuum, these have the values and , respectively. Hence we define the &quot;relative&quot; permittivity (or dielectric constant) , and the &quot;relative&quot; permeability .

In optics it is common to assume that the medium is non-magnetic, so that . For ferromagnetic materials at radio/microwave frequencies, larger values of must be taken into account. But, for optically transparent media, and for all other materials at optical frequencies (except possible metamaterials), is indeed very close to 1; that is, .

In optics, one usually knows the refractive index of the medium, which is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum () to the speed of light in the medium. In the analysis of partial reflection and transmission, one is also interested in the electromagnetic wave impedance , which is the ratio of the amplitude of to the amplitude of . It is therefore desirable to express and in terms of and , and thence to relate to . The last-mentioned relation, however, will make it convenient to derive the reflection coefficients in terms of the wave &quot;admittance&quot; , which is the reciprocal of the wave impedance .

In the case of &quot;uniform plane sinusoidal&quot; waves, the wave impedance or admittance is known as the &quot;intrinsic&quot; impedance or admittance of the medium. This case is the one for which the Fresnel coefficients are to be derived.

=== Electromagnetic plane waves ===
In a uniform plane sinusoidal electromagnetic wave, the electric field has the form

where is the (constant) complex amplitude vector, is the imaginary unit, is the wave vector (whose magnitude is the angular wavenumber), is the position vector, is the angular frequency, is time, and it is understood that the &quot;real part&quot; of the expression is the physical field.  The value of the expression is unchanged if the position varies in a direction normal to ; hence &quot;is normal to the wavefronts&quot;.

To advance the phase by the angle &quot;ϕ&quot;, we replace by (that is, we replace by ), with the result that the (complex) field is multiplied by . So a phase &quot;advance&quot; is equivalent to multiplication by a complex constant with a &quot;negative&quot; argument. This becomes more obvious when the field () is factored as , where the last factor contains the time-dependence. That factor also implies that differentiation w.r.t. time corresponds to multiplication by .

If &quot;ℓ&quot; is the component of in the direction of , the field () can be written .  If the argument of is to be constant,  &quot;ℓ&quot; must increase at the velocity formula_20 known as the &quot;phase velocity&quot; . This in turn is equal to Solving for gives
As usual, we drop the time-dependent factor , which is understood to multiply every complex field quantity. The electric field for a uniform plane sine wave will then be represented by the location-dependent &quot;phasor&quot;
.&lt;/math&gt;|}}
For fields of that form, Faraday&#x27;s law and the Maxwell-Ampère law respectively reduce to
formula_21

Putting and , as above, we can eliminate and to obtain equations in only and :
formula_22
If the material parameters and are real (as in a lossless dielectric), these equations show that form a &quot;right-handed orthogonal triad&quot;, so that the same equations apply to the magnitudes of the respective vectors. Taking the magnitude equations and substituting from (), we obtain
formula_23
where and are the magnitudes of and . Multiplying the last two equations gives

Dividing (or cross-multiplying) the same two equations gives , where

This is the &quot;intrinsic admittance&quot;.

From () we obtain the phase velocity For vacuum this reduces to Dividing the second result by the first gives
formula_24
For a &quot;non-magnetic&quot; medium (the usual case), this becomes .
Taking the reciprocal of (), we find that the intrinsic &quot;impedance&quot; is In vacuum this takes the value formula_25 known as the impedance of free space. By division, /\epsilon_{\text{rel}}}&lt;/math&gt;.}} For a &quot;non-magnetic&quot; medium, this becomes formula_26

=== Wave vectors ===
In Cartesian coordinates , let the region have refractive index , intrinsic admittance , etc., and let the region have refractive index , intrinsic admittance , etc. Then the plane is the interface, and the axis is normal to the interface (see diagram). Let and (in bold roman type) be the unit vectors in the and directions, respectively. Let the plane of incidence be the plane (the plane of the page), with the angle of incidence measured from towards . Let the angle of refraction, measured in the same sense, be , where the subscript stands for &quot;transmitted&quot; (reserving for &quot;reflected&quot;).

In the absence of Doppler shifts, &quot;ω&quot; does not change on reflection or refraction. Hence, by (), the magnitude of the wave vector is proportional to the refractive index.

So, for a given , if we &quot;redefine&quot; as the magnitude of the wave vector in the &quot;reference&quot; medium (for which ), then the wave vector has magnitude in the first medium (region in the diagram) and magnitude in the second medium. From the magnitudes and the geometry, we find that the wave vectors are
formula_27
where the last step uses Snell&#x27;s law. The corresponding dot products in the phasor form () are

Hence:
=== &quot;s&quot; components ===
For the &quot;s&quot; polarization, the field is parallel to the axis and may therefore be described by its component in the  direction. Let the reflection and transmission coefficients be and , respectively. Then, if the incident field is taken to have unit amplitude, the phasor form () of its -component is
,&lt;/math&gt;|}}
and the reflected and transmitted fields, in the same form, are
 E_\text{t} &amp;= t_{s\,} e^{i\mathbf{k}_\text{t}\mathbf{\cdot r}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Under the sign convention used in this article, a positive reflection or transmission coefficient is one that preserves the direction of the &quot;transverse&quot; field, meaning (in this context) the field normal to the plane of incidence. For the &quot;s&quot; polarization, that means the field. If the incident, reflected, and transmitted fields (in the above equations) are in the -direction (&quot;out of the page&quot;), then the respective fields are in the directions of the red arrows, since form a right-handed orthogonal triad. The fields may therefore be described by their components in the directions of those arrows, denoted by . Then, since ,
 H_\text{r} &amp;=\, Y_1 r_{s\,} e^{i\mathbf{k}_\text{r}\mathbf{\cdot r}}\\
 H_\text{t} &amp;=\, Y_2 t_{s\,} e^{i\mathbf{k}_\text{t}\mathbf{\cdot r}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

At the interface, by the usual interface conditions for electromagnetic fields, the tangential components of the and fields must be continuous; that is,

When we substitute from equations () to () and then from (), the exponential factors cancel out, so that the interface conditions reduce to the simultaneous equations

which are easily solved for and , yielding
{Y_1\cos\theta_\text{i}+Y_2\cos\theta_\text{t}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
and
{Y_1\cos\theta_\text{i}+Y_2\cos\theta_\text{t}}\.&lt;/math&gt;|}}
At &quot;normal incidence&quot; , indicated by an additional subscript 0, these results become

and

At &quot;grazing incidence&quot; , we have , hence and .

=== &quot;p&quot; components ===
For the &quot;p&quot; polarization, the incident, reflected, and transmitted fields are parallel to the red arrows and may therefore be described by their components in the directions of those arrows. Let those components be (redefining the symbols for the new context). Let the reflection and transmission coefficients be and . Then, if the incident field is taken to have unit amplitude, we have
 E_\text{r} &amp;= r_{p\,} e^{i\mathbf{k}_\text{r}\mathbf{\cdot r}}\\
 E_\text{t} &amp;= t_{p\,} e^{i\mathbf{k}_\text{t}\mathbf{\cdot r}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
If the fields are in the directions of the red arrows, then, in order for to form a right-handed orthogonal triad, the respective fields must be in the -direction (&quot;into the page&quot;) and may therefore be described by their components in that direction. This is consistent with the adopted sign convention, namely that a positive reflection or transmission coefficient is one that preserves the direction of the transverse field the field in the case of the &quot;p&quot; polarization. The agreement of the &quot;other&quot; field with the red arrows reveals an alternative definition of the sign convention: that a positive reflection or transmission coefficient is one for which the field vector in the plane of incidence points towards the same medium before and after reflection or transmission.

So, for the incident, reflected, and transmitted fields, let the respective components in the -direction be . Then, since ,
 H_\text{r} &amp;=\, Y_1 r_{p\,} e^{i\mathbf{k}_\text{r}\mathbf{\cdot r}}\\
 H_\text{t} &amp;=\, Y_2 t_{p\,} e^{i\mathbf{k}_\text{t}\mathbf{\cdot r}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

At the interface, the tangential components of the and fields must be continuous; that is,

When we substitute from equations () and () and then from (), the exponential factors again cancel out, so that the interface conditions reduce to

Solving for and , we find
{Y_2\cos\theta_\text{i}+Y_1\cos\theta_\text{t}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
and
{Y_2\cos\theta_\text{i}+Y_1\cos\theta_\text{t}}\.&lt;/math&gt;|}}
At &quot;normal incidence&quot; indicated by an additional subscript 0, these results become

and

At , we again have , hence and .

Comparing () and () with () and (), we see that at &quot;normal&quot; incidence, under the adopted sign convention, the transmission coefficients for the two polarizations are equal, whereas the reflection coefficients have equal magnitudes but opposite signs. While this clash of signs is a disadvantage of the convention, the attendant advantage is that the signs agree at &quot;grazing&quot; incidence.

=== Power ratios (reflectivity and transmissivity) ===
The &quot;Poynting vector&quot; for a wave is a vector whose component in any direction is the &quot;irradiance&quot; (power per unit area) of that wave on a surface perpendicular to that direction. For a plane sinusoidal wave the Poynting vector is , where and are due &quot;only&quot; to the wave in question, and the asterisk denotes complex conjugation. Inside a lossless dielectric (the usual case), and are in phase, and at right angles to each other and to the wave vector ; so, for s polarization, using the and components of and respectively (or for p polarization, using the and components of and ), the irradiance in the direction of is given simply by , which is in a medium of intrinsic impedance . To compute the irradiance in the direction normal to the interface, as we shall require in the definition of the power transmission coefficient, we could use only the component (rather than the full component) of or or, equivalently, simply multiply by the proper geometric factor, obtaining .

From equations () and (), taking squared magnitudes, we find that the &quot;reflectivity&quot; (ratio of reflected power to incident power) is
{Y_1\cos\theta_\text{i}+Y_2\cos\theta_\text{t}}\right|^2&lt;/math&gt;|}}
for the s polarization, and
{Y_2\cos\theta_\text{i}+Y_1\cos\theta_\text{t}}\right|^2&lt;/math&gt;|}}
for the p polarization. Note that when comparing the powers of two such waves in the same medium and with the same cos&quot;θ&quot;, the impedance and geometric factors mentioned above are identical and cancel out. But in computing the power &quot;transmission&quot; (below), these factors must be taken into account.

The simplest way to obtain the power transmission coefficient (&quot;transmissivity&quot;, the ratio of transmitted power to incident power &quot;in the direction normal to the interface&quot;, i.e. the direction) is to use (conservation of energy). In this way we find
{\left|Y_1\cos\theta_\text{i}+Y_2\cos\theta_\text{t}\right|^2}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
for the s polarization, and
{\left|Y_2\cos\theta_\text{i}+Y_1\cos\theta_\text{t}\right|^2}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
for the p polarization.

In the case of an interface between two lossless media (for which ϵ and μ are &quot;real&quot; and positive), one can obtain these results directly using the squared magnitudes of the amplitude transmission coefficients that we found earlier in equations () and (). But, for given amplitude (as noted above), the component of the Poynting vector in the direction is proportional to the geometric factor and inversely proportional to the wave impedance . Applying these corrections to each wave, we obtain two ratios multiplying the square of the amplitude transmission coefficient:
{Y_1\cos\theta_\text{i}+Y_2\cos\theta_\text{t}}\right)^2\frac{\,Y_2\,}{Y_1}\,\frac{\cos\theta_\text{t}}{\cos\theta_\text{i}}
=\frac{4Y_1 Y_2\cos\theta_\text{i}\cos\theta_\text{t}}{\left(Y_1\cos\theta_\text{i}+Y_2\cos\theta_\text{t}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
for the s polarization, and
{Y_2\cos\theta_\text{i}+Y_1\cos\theta_\text{t}}\right)^2\frac{\,Y_2\,}{Y_1}\,\frac{\cos\theta_\text{t}}{\cos\theta_\text{i}}
=\frac{4Y_1 Y_2\cos\theta_\text{i}\cos\theta_\text{t}}{\left(Y_2\cos\theta_\text{i}+Y_1\cos\theta_\text{t}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
for the p polarization. The last two equations apply only to lossless dielectrics, and only at incidence angles smaller than the critical angle (beyond which, of course, ).

For unpolarized light:
formula_28
formula_29
where formula_30.

=== Equal refractive indices ===
From equations () and (), we see that two dissimilar media will have the same refractive index, but different admittances, if the ratio of their permeabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their permittivities. In that unusual situation we have (that is, the transmitted ray is undeviated), so that the cosines in equations (), (), (), (), and () to () cancel out, and all the reflection and transmission ratios become independent of the angle of incidence; in other words, the ratios for normal incidence become applicable to all angles of incidence. When extended to spherical reflection or scattering, this results in the Kerker effect for Mie scattering.

=== Non-magnetic media ===
Since the Fresnel equations were developed for optics, they are usually given for non-magnetic materials. Dividing () by ()) yields
formula_31
For non-magnetic media we can substitute the vacuum permeability for , so that
formula_32
that is, the admittances are simply proportional to the corresponding refractive indices. When we make these substitutions in equations () to () and equations () to (), the factor &quot;cμ&quot;0 cancels out. For the amplitude coefficients we obtain:

{n_1\cos\theta_\text{i}+n_2\cos\theta_\text{t}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
{n_1\cos\theta_\text{i}+n_2\cos\theta_\text{t}}\,&lt;/math&gt;|}}

{n_2\cos\theta_\text{i}+n_1\cos\theta_\text{t}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
{n_2\cos\theta_\text{i}+n_1\cos\theta_\text{t}}\.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

For the case of normal incidence these reduce to:



The power reflection coefficients become:
{n_1\cos\theta_\text{i}+n_2\cos\theta_\text{t}}\right|^2&lt;/math&gt;|}}
{n_2\cos\theta_\text{i}+n_1\cos\theta_\text{t}}\right|^2\.&lt;/math&gt;|}}
The power transmissions can then be found from .

=== Brewster&#x27;s angle ===
For equal permeabilities (e.g., non-magnetic media), if and are &quot;complementary&quot;, we can substitute for , and for , so that the numerator in equation () becomes , which is zero (by Snell&#x27;s law). Hence and only the s-polarized component is reflected. This is what happens at the Brewster angle. Substituting for in Snell&#x27;s law, we readily obtain

for Brewster&#x27;s angle.

=== Equal permittivities ===
Although it is not encountered in practice, the equations can also apply to the case of two media with a common permittivity but different refractive indices due to different permeabilities. From equations () and (), if is fixed instead of , then becomes &quot;inversely&quot; proportional to , with the result that the subscripts 1 and 2 in equations () to () are interchanged (due to the additional step of multiplying the numerator and denominator by ). Hence, in () and (), the expressions for and in terms of refractive indices will be interchanged, so that Brewster&#x27;s angle () will give instead of , and any beam reflected at that angle will be p-polarized instead of s-polarized. Similarly, Fresnel&#x27;s sine law will apply to the p polarization instead of the s polarization, and his tangent law to the s polarization instead of the p polarization.

This switch of polarizations has an analog in the old mechanical theory of light waves (see &quot;§History&quot;, above). One could predict reflection coefficients that agreed with observation by supposing (like Fresnel) that different refractive indices were due to different &quot;densities&quot; and that the vibrations were &quot;normal&quot; to what was then called the plane of polarization, or by supposing (like MacCullagh and Neumann) that different refractive indices were due to different &quot;elasticities&quot; and that the vibrations were &quot;parallel&quot; to that plane. Thus the condition of equal permittivities and unequal permeabilities, although not realistic, is of some historical interest.

<text>Figure skating is a sport in which individuals, pairs, or groups perform on figure skates on ice. It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games, with its introduction occurring at the 1908 Olympics in London. The Olympic disciplines are men&#x27;s singles, women&#x27;s singles, pair skating, and ice dance; the four individual disciplines are also combined into a team event, which was first included in the Winter Olympics in 2014. The non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating, Theater on Ice, and four skating. From intermediate through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs (the short program and the free skate), which, depending on the discipline, may include spins, jumps, moves in the field, lifts, throw jumps, death spirals, and other elements or moves.

Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level (senior) at local, regional, sectional, national, and international competitions. The International Skating Union (ISU) regulates international figure skating judging and competitions. These include the Winter Olympics, the World Championships, the World Junior Championships, the European Championships, the Four Continents Championships, the Grand Prix series (senior and junior), and the ISU Challenger Series.

The sport is also associated with show business. Major competitions generally conclude with exhibition galas, in which the top skaters from each discipline perform non-competitive programs. Many skaters, both during and after their competitive careers, also skate in ice shows, which run during the competitive season and the off-season.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;professional&quot; in skating refers not to skill level but competitive status. Figure skaters competing at the highest levels of international competition are not &quot;professional&quot; skaters. They are sometimes referred to as amateurs, even though some earn money. Professional skaters include those who have lost their ISU eligibility and those who perform only in shows. They may also include former Olympic and World champions who have ended their competitive career, as well as skaters with little or no international competitive experience. In addition to performing in ice shows, professional skaters often compete in professional competitions, which are held throughout the world, each with its own format and rules.

The term &quot;figure skating&quot; is an English language term; the sport is called &quot;Eiskunstlauf&quot; in German and &quot;patinage artistique&quot; in French.
==Figure skates==

The most visible difference from ice hockey skates is that figure skates have a set of large, jagged teeth called &quot;toe picks&quot; on the front part of the blade. These are used primarily in jumping and should not be used for stroking or spins. If used during a spin, the toe pick will cause the skater to lose momentum, or move away from the center of the spin. Blades are mounted to the sole and heel of the boot with screws. Typically, high-level figure skaters are professionally fitted for their boots and blades at a reputable skate shop. Professionals are also employed to sharpen blades to individual requirements.

Blades are about thick. When viewed from the side, the blade of a figure skate is not flat, but curved slightly, forming an arc of a circle with a radius of . This curvature is referred to as the &quot;rocker&quot; of the blade. The &quot;sweet spot&quot; is the part of the blade on which all spins are rotated; this is usually located near the stanchion of the blade, below the ball of the foot. The blade is also &quot;hollow ground&quot;; a groove on the bottom of the blade creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The inside edge of the blade is on the side closest to the skater; the outside edge of the blade is on the side farthest from the skater. In figure skating, it is always desirable to skate on only one edge of the blade. Skating on both at the same time (which is referred to as a &quot;flat&quot;) may result in lower skating skills scores. The apparently effortless power and glide across the ice exhibited by elite figure skaters fundamentally derives from efficient use of the edges to generate speed.

Skates used in singles and pair skating have a set of large, jagged teeth called a toepick on the front of each blade. The toepicks are mainly used to help launch the skater into the air for the take-off when performing jumps. Ice dance blades have smaller toepicks than blades used for the other disciplines.

During a spin, skaters use the sweet spot of the blade, which is one of two rockers to be found on a blade and is the roundest portion of the blade. The sweet spot is located just behind the toe pick and near the middle of the blade. The other rocker is the more general curvature of the blade when stroking or gliding.

Ice dancers&#x27; blades are about an inch shorter in the rear than those used by skaters in other disciplines, to accommodate the intricate footwork and close partnering in dance. Dancers&#x27; blades also have a smaller toepick as they do not require the large toepick used for jumping in the other disciplines. Hard plastic &quot;skate guards&quot; are used when the skater must walk in his or her skates when not on the ice, to protect the blade from dirt or material on the ground that may dull the blade. Soft blade covers called &quot;soakers&quot; are used to absorb condensation and protect the blades from rust when the skates are not being worn. In competition, skaters are allowed three minutes to make repairs to their skates.

There are many different types of boots and blades to suit different disciplines and abilities. For example, athletes who are performing advanced multi-rotational jumps often need a stiffer boot that is higher and gives more support. Athletes working on single or double jumps require less support and may use a less stiff boot. Ice dancers may prefer a lower cut boot that is designed to enable more knee bend.

Likewise, blades designed for free and pairs skating have a longer tail to assist landing. The blade profile and picks are designed to assist with spinning, jump entry, take-off, landing, and exit. Modern blade technology increasingly uses carbon fibre and materials other than steel to make blades lighter. These materials may also be more flexible and help cushion jump landings and be protective of young athlete&#x27;s joints. Ice dance blades have short tails to enable close foot work and reduce the risk of blade clash in close complex moves. They may also be thinner to assist with glide and fast changes of edge.

Off-ice training is the term for physical conditioning that takes place off the ice. Besides regular physical exercise, skaters do walk-throughs of jumps off the ice to practice sufficient rotation and height of their jumps, and to practice consistency in landing on one foot. In 2020/2021 many athletes relied on a variety of off-ice training and conditioning methods due to rinks being closed due to COVID-19.

==Ice rinks and rink equipment==
Since 1980, all figure skating competitions must be held in completely covered and enclosed rinks. The rule was expanded to include practice rinks in 1984. According to figure skating historian James R. Hines, the development of indoor ice rinks, other than the development of the bladed skate during the 14th century and the practice of fastening boots permanently to skates in the 19th century, has had the greatest effect on figure skating. It allowed for skating year-round, as well as anywhere in the world, and prevented the cancellation of competitive events due to the lack of ice in outdoor rinks. The first attempts to make artificial ice occurred during the 1870s in England and the U.S. The first notable indoor ice rink was made in 1876, by John Gamgee, in Chelsea along the north bank of the Thames River; it measured 24 by 40 feet. By the end of the 19th century, many major cities in Europe and North America had indoor rinks.

There is significant variation in the dimensions of ice rinks. Olympic-sized rinks have dimensions of , NHL-sized rinks are , while European rinks are sometimes . The ISU prefers Olympic-sized rinks for figure skating competitions, particularly for major events. According to ISU rule 342, a figure skating rink for an ISU event &quot;if possible, shall measure sixty (60) meters in one direction and thirty (30) meters in the other, but not larger, and not less than fifty-six (56) meters in one direction and twenty-six (26) meters in the other.&quot; The scoring system rewards skaters who have good ice coverage, i.e. those who efficiently cover the entire ice surface during their programs. Olympic-sized rinks make the differences in skill between skaters more apparent but they are not available for all events. If a rink has different dimensions, a skater&#x27;s jump setup and speed may be hindered as he or she adjusts.

Ice quality is judged by smoothness, friction, hardness, and brittleness. Factors affecting ice quality include temperature, water quality, and usage, with toe picks causing more deterioration. For figure skating, the ice surface temperature is normally maintained between , with the Olympic disciplines requiring slightly softer ice (−3.5°C) than synchronized skating (−5.5°C). Typically after every two warm-up groups, an ice resurfacer cleans and smooths the surface of the ice sheet. Inadequate ice quality may affect skaters&#x27; performances.

Some rinks have a harness system installed to help skaters learn new jumps in a controlled manner. A heavy-duty cable is securely attached to two of the walls around the ice, with a set of pulleys riding on the cable. The skater wears a vest or belt, with a cable or rope attached to it, and the cable/rope is threaded through the movable pulley on the cable above. The coach holds the other end of the cable and lifts the skater by pulling the cable/rope. The skater can then practice the jump with the coach assisting the completion. This is used when a skater needs more help on a jump. However, if the coaches see fit, they could use another harness usually called &quot;the fishing pole harness.&quot; It is named that because it looks similar to a fishing pole. The skater will put on the harness and the coach will adjust it so it fits the skater. The skater will go and do the jump with very little help from their coach. They can also do the jump on any pattern they choose, whereas, the other harness, they must do in a straight line.

==Disciplines==
Figure skating consists of the following disciplines:
*In Single skating, male and female skaters compete individually. Figure skating is the oldest winter sport contested at the Olympics, with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s single skating appearing as two of the four figure skating events at the London Games in 1908. Single skating has required elements that skaters must perform during a competition and that make up a well-balanced skating program. They include jumps (and jump combinations), spins, step sequences, and choreographic sequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;P/ID2022-112&quot;&gt;S&amp;P/ID 2022, pp. 105—106, 110&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pair skating is defined as &quot;the skating of two persons in unison who perform their movements in such harmony with each other as to give the impression of genuine Pair Skating as compared with independent Single Skating&quot;. The ISU also states that a pairs team consists of &quot;one Woman and one Man&quot;. Pair skating, along with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s single skating, has been an Olympic discipline since figure skating, the oldest Winter Olympic sport, was introduced at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. The ISU World Figure Skating Championships introduced pair skating in 1908. Pair skating required elements include lifts, twist lifts, jumps and partner assisted jumps, pair spins, death spirals, step sequences, and choreographic sequences. The elements performed by pairs teams must be &quot;linked together by connecting steps of a different nature&quot; and by other comparable movements and with a variety of holds and positions.
*Ice dance historically draws from ballroom dancing. It joined the World Figure Skating Championships in 1952, and became a Winter Olympic Games medal sport in 1976. According to the ISU, an ice dance team consists of one woman and one man. Ice dance has its roots in the &quot;combined skating&quot; developed in the 19th century by skating clubs and organizations and in recreational social skating. The first national competitions occurred in England, Canada, the U.S., and Austria during the 1930s. The first international ice dance competition took place as a special event at the World Championships in 1950 in London. The elements ice dance teams must perform are the dance lift, the dance spin, the step sequence, twizzles, and choreographic elements.
*Synchronized skating (formerly known as &quot;precision skating&quot;) is for mixed-gender groups of between twelve and twenty figure skaters. This discipline resembles a group form of ice dance, with additional emphasis on precise formations of the group as a whole and complex transitions between formations. The basic formations include wheels, blocks, lines, circles, and intersections. The close formations, and the need for the team to stay in unison, add to the difficulty of the footwork performed by the skaters in these elements. Formal proposals were put forward by the ISU to include synchronized skating in the 2022 Winter Olympics, but those efforts have been unsuccessful.
*Compulsory figures or school figures were formerly a discipline of figure skating, and gave the sport its name. They are the &quot;circular patterns which skaters trace on the ice to demonstrate skill in placing clean turns evenly on round circles&quot;. For approximately the first 50 years of figure skating as a sport, until 1947, compulsory figures made up 60 percent of the total score at most competitions around the world. These figures continued to dominate the sport, although they steadily declined in importance, until the ISU voted to discontinue them as a part of competitions in 1990. Since 2015 with the founding of the World Figure Sport Society and the World Figure &amp; Fancy Skating Championships &amp; Festival on black ice more skaters are training and competing in figures. More coaches are learning the new methods developed by World Figure Sport to teach them to skaters, as some skaters and coaches believe that figures give skaters an advantage in developing alignment, core strength, body control, and discipline.

==Elements and moves==
Each element receives a score according to its base value and grade of execution (GOE), resulting in a combined technical elements score (TES). At competitions, a technical specialist identifies the elements and assigns each one a level of difficulty, ranging from B (Basic) to Level 4 (most difficult). For each element, a panel of judges determines the GOE, ranging between −5 and +5, according to how well the skater executes the element. The GOE is weighted according to the base value of the element. Through the ISU guidelines skaters must perform a minimum of seven elements in their short program and twelve elements in their long program.

The ISU defines a fall as a loss of control with the result that the majority of the skater&#x27;s body weight is not on the blade but supported by hands, knees, or buttocks.

===Jumps===

Jumps involve the skater leaping into the air and rotating rapidly to land after completing one or more rotations. There are many types of jumps, identified by the way the skater takes off and lands, as well as by the number of rotations that are completed.

Each jump receives a score according to its base value and grade of execution (GOE). Quality of execution, technique, height, speed, flow and ice coverage are considered by the judges. An &quot;under-rotated&quot; jump (indicated by&lt;) is &quot;missing rotation of more than , but less than revolution&quot; and receives 70% of the base value. A &quot;downgraded&quot; jump (indicated by«) is &quot;missing rotation of revolution or more&quot;. A downgraded triple is treated as a double jump, while a downgraded double is treated as a single jump.

An edge violation occurs when a skater executes a jump on the incorrect edge. The hollow is a groove on the bottom of the blade which creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The inside edge of the blade is on the side closest to the skater, the outside edge is on the side farthest from the skater, and a &quot;flat&quot; refers to skating on both edges at the same time, which is discouraged. An unclear edge or edge violation is indicated with an &#x27;e&#x27; and reflected in the GOE according to the severity of the problem. &quot;Flutz&quot; and &quot;lip&quot; are the colloquial terms for a Lutz and flip jump with an edge violation.

In 1982, the ISU enacted a rule stating that a skater may perform each type of triple only once in a program, or twice if one of them is incorporated into a combination or sequence. For a set of jumps to be considered a &quot;combination&quot;, each jump must take off from the landing edge of the previous jump, with no steps, turns, or change of edge between jumps. Toe loops and loops are commonly performed as the second or third jump in a combination because they take off from the back outside edge of the landing foot, or skating leg. To perform a salchow or flip on the back end of a combination, a half loop (which is actually a full rotation, but lands on a back inside edge of the landing leg) may be used as a connecting jump. In contrast, jump &quot;sequences&quot; are sets of jumps that may be linked by non-listed jumps or hops. Sequences are worth 80% of the combined value of the same jumps executed in combination.
A figure skater only needs to be able to jump in one direction, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. The vast majority of figure skaters prefer to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction when jumping. Thus, for clarity, all jumps will be described for a skater jumping counter-clockwise.

There are six jumps in figure skating that count as jump elements. All six are landed on one foot on the back outside edge (with counter-clockwise rotation, for single and multi-revolution jumps), but have different takeoffs, by which they may be distinguished. Jumps are divided into two different categories: &quot;toe jumps&quot; and &quot;edge jumps&quot;.

The number of rotations performed in the air determines whether the jump is a single, double, triple, or quadruple (commonly known as a &quot;quad&quot;). The simplest jump is a waltz jump, which can only be done in a half-leap and is not classified as a single, double, or triple jump. Triple jumps, other than the triple Axel, are commonly performed by female single skaters. It is rare for a female skater to land a quadruple jump, and very few female single skaters have been credited with quads in competition. Senior-level male single skaters perform mostly triple and quadruple jumps in competition. The final of the six jumps to be landed cleanly as a quad in international competition is the elusive quadruple Axel. A few male skaters made valiant efforts to land the immensely difficult four-and-a-half revolution jump (most notably two-time Olympic Champion from Japan, Yuzuru Hanyu), but failed to land one cleanly and fully-rotated. The first clean and fully-rotated quad Axel was successfully landed by American men&#x27;s skater Ilia Malinin at the 2022 CS U.S. Classic, 34 years after the first-ever quadruple jump (a quad toe loop) was landed by Canada&#x27;s Kurt Browning at the World Figure Skating Championships in 1988.

Some elite skaters can complete a jump in about one second, with 26 inches of height and 10 feet in distance. The takeoff speed of a jump can reach up to 25 kilometers per hour. Prior to most jumps, a figure skater needs to skate backward to build power and speed.

====Toe jumps====
Toe jumps are launched by digging the toe pick of one skate into the ice, using it to vault into the air with the opposite leg. The main toe jumps are (in order of score value):
#Toe loop – the skater takes off backwards from the outside edge of the right (or left) foot, launching the jump using the opposite toe pick.
#Flip (sometimes known as a toe salchow)the skater takes off backwards from the inside edge of the left (or right) foot and assists the take-off using the opposite toe pick.
#Lutz – similar to the flip, but the skater takes off from the backward &quot;outside&quot; edge of the left (or right) foot, launching the jump using the opposite toe pick.

All of the above descriptions assume a counter-clockwise direction of rotation, landing backwards on the outside edge of the right foot. (For clockwise rotation, the skater takes off using the alternative foot and lands backwards on the outside edge of the left foot.)

====Edge jumps====
Edge jumps use no toe assist, and include (in order of score value):
#Salchow – the skater takes off backwards from the inside edge of the left (or right) foot, allowing the edge to come round, the opposite leg helps to launch the jump into the air.
#Loop (also known as a Rittberger jump)the skater takes off backwards from the outside edge of the right (or left) foot.
#Axel – the skater takes off forwards from the outside edge of the left (or right) foot. As this is the only rotating jump to take off from a forward edge, it includes an extra half rotation.

Again, these descriptions assume a counter-clockwise direction of rotation, landing backwards on the outside edge of the right foot. (For clockwise rotation, the skater takes off using the alternative foot and always lands backwards on the outside edge of the left foot.)

====Other jumps====
Several other jumps are usually performed only as single jumps and in elite skating are used as transitional movements or highlights in step sequences. These include the half toe loop (ballet jump), half loop, half flip, walley jump, waltz jump, inside Axel, one-foot Axel, stag jump, and split jump. There are two kinds of split jump:
*Russian split, performed in a position that is similar to that of a straddle split
*front split, performed in the position of the more traditional split, facing the direction of the front leg
===Spins===
Spins are an element in which the skater rotates, centered on a single point on the ice, while holding one or more body positions. They are performed by all disciplines of the sport. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; says, &quot;While jumps look like sport, spins look more like art. While jumps provide the suspense, spins provide the scenery, but there is so much more to the scenery than most viewers have time or means to grasp&quot;. According to world champion and figure skating commentator Scott Hamilton, spins are often used &quot;as breathing points or transitions to bigger things&quot;

Figure skating spins, along with jumps, spirals, and spread eagles were originally individual compulsory figures, sometimes special figures. Unlike jumps, spins were a &quot;graceful and appreciated&quot; part of figure skating throughout the 19th century. They advanced between World War I and World War II; by the late 1930s, all three basic spin positions were used.

There are two types of spins, the forward spin and the backward spin. There are three basic spin positions: the upright spin, the sit spin, and the camel spin. Skaters also perform flying spins and combination spins.

===Lifts===

Figure skating lifts are required elements in pair skating and ice dance. There are five groups of lifts in pair skating, categorized in order of increasing level of difficulty. Judges look for the following when evaluating pair lifts: speed of entry and exit; control of the woman&#x27;s free leg when she is exiting out of the lift, with the goal of keeping the leg high and sweeping; the position of the woman in the air; the man&#x27;s footwork; quick and easy changes of position; and the maintenance of flow throughout the lift. Twist lifts are &quot;the most thrilling and exciting component in pair skating&quot;. They can also be the most difficult movement to perform correctly. They require more strength and coordination than many other pair elements, and are usually the first or second element in a program. According to the International Skating Union (ISU), &quot;the Woman must be caught in the air at the waist by the Man prior to landing and be assisted to a smooth landing on the ice on a backward outside edge on one foot&quot; during a twist lift.

The ISU defines dance lifts as &quot;a movement in which one of the partners is elevated with active and/or passive assistance of the other partner to any permitted height, sustained there and set down on the ice&quot;. Dance lifts are delineated from pair lifts to ensure that ice dance and pair skating remain separate disciplines. After the judging system changed from the 6.0 system to the ISU Judging System (IJS), dance lifts became more &quot;athletic, dramatic and exciting&quot;. There are two types of dance lifts: short lifts, which should be done in under seven seconds; and combination lifts, which should be done in under 12 seconds. A well-balanced free dance program in ice dance must include dance lifts.

===Turns, steps, moves===
Along with other forms of skating, figure skating is one of the only human powered activities where travelling backwards is integral to the discipline. The ability to skate well backwards and forwards are considered to be equally important, as is the ability to transition well between the two.

Step sequences are a required element in all four Olympic disciplines. The pattern can be straight line, circular, or serpentine. The step sequence consists of a combination of turns, steps, hops and edge changes. Additionally, steps and turns can be used as transitions between elements. The various turns, which skaters can incorporate into step sequences, include:
Choctaws are the two-foot equivalents of rockers and counters. Other movements that may be incorporated into step sequences or used as connecting elements include lunges and spread eagles. An Ina Bauer is similar to a spread eagle performed with one knee bent and typically an arched back. Hydroblading refers to a deep edge performed with the body as low as possible to the ice in a near-horizontal position.

Moves in the field is a pre-determined required sequence that demonstrated basic skating skills and edge control. In the context of a competitive program, they include sequences that may include spirals, spread eagles, Ina Bauers, hydroblading, and similar extended edge moves, along with loops, twizzles, and different kinds of turns.

A spiral is an element in which the skater moves across the ice on a specific edge with the free leg held at hip level or above. Spirals are distinguished by the edge of the blade used (inside or outside), the direction of motion (forward or backward), and the skater&#x27;s position. A spiral sequence is one or more spiral positions and edges done in sequence. Judges look at the depth, stability, and control of the skating edge, speed and ice coverage, extension, and other factors. Some skaters can change edges during a spiral, i.e. from inside to outside edge. Spirals performed on a &quot;flat&quot; are generally not considered as true spirals. Spiral sequences were required in women&#x27;s and pair skating prior to the 2012–13 season, but from the 2012–13 season onward, they were replaced by the choreographic sequence. The choreographic sequence consists of moves in the field, unlisted jumps, spinning movements, etc. and is required for the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and pair free program.

A death spiral is a required element of pair skating. There are four varieties distinguished by the lady&#x27;s edge and direction of motion. The man performs a pivot, one toe anchored in the ice, while holding the hand of his partner, who circles him on a deep edge with her body almost parallel to the ice. As of 2011, the woman&#x27;s head must at some time reach her skating knee. The man must also be in a full pivot position and the death spiral must be held for a minimum amount of rotation, depending on the level.
==Competition format and scoring==

The ISU is the governing body for international competitions in figure skating, including the World Championships and the figure skating events at the Winter Olympic Games. Medals are awarded for overall results; the standard medals are gold for first place, silver for second, and bronze for third place. U.S. Figure Skating also awards pewter medals for fourth-place finishers in national events. Additionally, at the World, European, Four Continents, and World Junior Championships, the ISU awards &quot;small medals&quot; for segment results (short and free program) (Since 2009). A medal is generally attributed to only one country, even if a partnership is composed of skaters with different nationalities. A notable exception was the pair skating partnership between Ludowika Eilers and Walter Jakobsson; their 1910–11 medals were attributed to both Germany and Finland. Beyond the early 20th century, no skaters have been allowed to represent two countries in the same competition.

In singles and pairs figure skating competition, competitors perform two programs: the short program, in which they complete a set of required elements consisting of jumps, spins and steps; and the free skate, also known as the &quot;long program&quot;, in which they have a slightly wider choice of elements. Under both the 6.0 system and the ISU Judging System, the judges consider the &quot;complete package&quot; when evaluating performances, i.e. the best jumper is not always placed first if the judges consider the difference in jumping execution to be outweighed by another skater&#x27;s speed, spins, presentation, etc.

Ice dance competitions formerly consisted of three phases: one or more compulsory dances; an original dance to a ballroom rhythm that was designated annually; and a free dance to music of the skaters&#x27; own choice. Beginning in the 2010–11 season, the compulsory and original dances were merged into the short dance, which itself was renamed the &quot;rhythm dance&quot; in June 2018, before the 2018–19 season.

===6.0 System===
Skating was formerly judged for &quot;technical merit&quot; (in the free skate), &quot;required elements&quot; (in the short program), and &quot;presentation&quot; (in both programs). The marks for each program ran from 0.0 to 6.0, the latter being the highest. These marks were used to determine a preference ranking (or &quot;ordinal&quot;) separately for each judge; the judges&#x27; preferences were then combined to determine placements for each skater in each program. The placements for the two programs were then combined, with the free skate placement weighted more heavily than the short program. The highest placing individual (based on the sum of the weighted placements) was declared the winner.

===ISU Judging System===
In 2004, in response to the judging controversy during the 2002 Winter Olympics, the ISU adopted the International Judging System (IJS), which became mandatory at all international competitions in 2006, including the 2006 Winter Olympics. The new system is sometimes informally referred to as the &quot;Code of Points&quot;, however, the ISU has never used the term to describe their system in any of their official communications.

Under the IJS, points are awarded individually for each skating element, and the sum of these points is the &quot;total element score&quot; (TES). Competitive programs are constrained to include a set number of elements. Each element is judged first by a technical specialist who identifies the specific element and determines its &quot;base value&quot;. This is done using instant replay video to verify features that distinguish different elements; e.g. the exact foot position at take-off and landing of a jump. A panel of nine judges then each award a mark for the quality and execution of the element. This mark, called the &quot;grade of execution&quot; (GOE), is an integer with a minimum value of −5 and a maximum value of +5. The GOE mark is then translated into another value by using the table of values in ISU rule 322. The GOE value from the nine judges is then processed with a computerized random selection of nine judges, the highest and lowest values are then discarded, and finally the average of the remaining seven is calculated. This average value is then added to (or subtracted from) the base value to determine the total value for the element.

Note: The IJS previously used a GOE scale of −3 to +3, but this was changed for the 2018–19 season.

The &quot;program components score&quot; (PCS) awards points to holistic aspects of a program or other nuances that are not rewarded in the &quot;total element score&quot;. The components are:

:* Composition : This evaluates how the program is designed in relation to the music; how are the different elements connected; how is the available space used; how does the choreography reflect musical phrase and form?

:* Presentation: This evaluates how the program is performed; what does the skater express and project; what energy is created; what is the musical sensitivity and timing; for Pair, Ice Dance and Synchronized skating is the skating appropriately synchronized and showing awareness of space?

:* Skating skills: This mark assesses the skater&#x27;s command of the blade over the ice, including the ability to skate with power and ease. The judges look at variety and clarity of edges, balance, body control, turns, steps, flow, power and speed.

A detailed description of each component is given in ISU rule 322.2. Judges award each component a raw mark from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.25, with a mark of 5 being defined as &quot;average&quot;. For each separate component, the raw marks are then selected, trimmed, and averaged in a manner akin to determining a &quot;grade of execution&quot;. The trimmed mean scores are then translated into a factored mark by multiplying by a factor that depends on the discipline, competition segment, and level. Then the five (or four) factored marks are added to give the final PCS score.

The &quot;total element score&quot; and the &quot;program components score&quot; are added to give the total score for a competition segment (TSS). A skater&#x27;s final placement is determined by the total of their scores in all segments of a competition. No ordinal rankings are used to determine the final results.

===Other judging and competition===
There are also skating competitions organized for professional skaters by independent promoters. These competitions use judging rules set by whoever organizes the competition. There is no &quot;professional league&quot;. Well-known professional competitions in the past have included the World Professional Championships (held in Landover, Maryland), the Challenge Of Champions, the Canadian Professional Championships and the World Professional Championships (held in Jaca, Spain).

The Ice Skating Institute (ISI), an international ice rink trade organization, runs its own competitive and test program aimed at recreational skaters. Originally headquartered in Minnesota, the organization now operates out of Dallas, Texas. ISI competitions are open to any member that have registered their tests. There are very few &quot;qualifying&quot; competitions, although some districts hold Gold Competitions for that season&#x27;s first-place winners. ISI competitions are especially popular in Asian countries that do not have established ISU member federations. The Gay Games have also included skating competitions for same-gender pairs and dance couples under ISI sponsorship. Other figure skating competitions for adults also attract participants from diverse cultures.

==World standings and season&#x27;s bests==
===World standings===
The world standing (WS) of a skater/couple is calculated based on the results over the current and preceding two seasons. Competitors receive points based on their final placement at an event and the event&#x27;s weight. The following events receive points:
*ISU Championships (World, European, Four Continents, and World Junior Championships) and Olympic Winter Games: The best result by points per season, the best two results by points over the three seasons.
*ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating and Final (senior and junior): The two best results by points per season, the best four results by points over the three seasons.
*International senior calendar competitions: The two best results by points per season, the best four results by points over the three seasons.
Following the current season&#x27;s World Championships, the results from the earliest season are deleted. A new partnership starts with zero points; there is no transfer of WS points if a pair or ice dance couple split up and form a new partnership.

These standings do not necessarily reflect the capabilities of the skater(s). Due to limits on entries to events (no more than three from each country), and varying numbers of high-level skaters in each country, skaters from some countries may find it more difficult to qualify to compete at major events. Thus, a skater with a lower SB but from a country with few high-level skaters may qualify to a major event while a skater with a much higher SB but from a country with more than three high-level skaters may not be sent. As a result, it is possible for a skater who regularly scores higher to end up with a much lower world standing.

The &quot;season&#x27;s world ranking&quot; of a skater/couple is calculated similarly to the overall world standing but is based on the results of the ongoing season only.

===Season&#x27;s bests===
The season&#x27;s best (SB) of a skater/couple is the highest score achieved within a particular season. There is an SB for the combined total score and the individual segment scores (short program/rhythm dance, free skating/free dance). Only scores achieved at selected international competitions are considered; scores from national competitions and some international events are disregarded. The best combined total for each skater or couple appears on a list of season&#x27;s bests, and the list may be used to help determine participants in the following season&#x27;s Grand Prix series.

Skaters and couples also have personal best (PB) scores, i.e. the highest scores achieved over their entire career, in terms of combined total and segment scores. However, PB scores are not completely comparable if achieved in different seasons because the ISU regulations and technical rules are modified before each new season. There may be different requirements specified to achieve a certain level; the required elements may change and new elements may be allowed (for example, two quads in the short program were permitted starting in the 2010–11 season); and the point values may change (for example, the values of quads were increased after the 2010 Olympics, and a second step sequence is no longer assigned a level in the men&#x27;s competition). As a result of these variations in the technical requirements, the ISU places more weight on the season&#x27;s bests, which are fully comparable within any one season.

==Music and clothing==
===Music===
For competitive programs, figure skaters were once restricted to instrumental music; vocals were allowed only if they contained no lyrics or words. Beginning in the 1997–98 season, the ISU decided to allow lyrics or words in ice dance music. Although the rules were not relaxed for singles and pairs, judges did not always penalize violations. At the 2011 World Championships, Florent Amodio&#x27;s long program music included words but an insufficient number of judges voted for a deduction. In June 2012, the ISU voted to allow skaters from all disciplines to choose music with words in their competitive programs beginning in the 2014–15 season.

Skaters may use professional music editors so that their music meets requirements. Ice dancers are required to skate to music that has a definite beat or rhythm. Singles and pair skaters more often skate to the melody and phrasing of their music. For long programs, figure skaters generally search for music with different moods and tempos. Music selections for exhibitions are less constrained than for competitive programs.

===Clothing===
Skaters are generally free to select their own attire, with a few restrictions. In competition, women may wear a dress, typically with matching attached briefs. This rule of costuming was created in response to Katarina Witt&#x27;s costume and performance at the 1988 Winter Olympics. In 2004, the rule was extended to allow women to wear trousers. They may wear opaque flesh-colored leggings or tights under dresses and skirts, which may extend to cover their skates. Men must wear trousersthey are not allowed to wear tights, although officials do not always impose a deduction for violations. Matching costumes are not required in pair skating and ice dance.

Competition costumes vary widely, from simple designs to heavily beaded or trimmed costumes. Skaters risk a deduction if a piece of their costume falls onto the ice surface. An official may stop a program if he or she deems there to be a hazard. Skaters and family members may design their own costumes, sometimes with assistance from their coach or choreographer, or turn to professional designers. Costumes may cost thousands of dollars if designed by a top-level costume maker.

According to current ISU regulations, costumes in competition must be fair, non-revealing, and appropriate for both short and long programs. Costumes should not be showy or exotic in nature. Clothing, however, can reflect the genre of music chosen. Although the use of flesh-colored fabric means the costumes are often less revealing than they may appear, there have been repeated attempts to ban clothing that gives the impression of &quot;excessive nudity&quot; or that is otherwise inappropriate for athletic competition. In general, accessories or props are not permitted in competition. The ISU allowed an exception for the original dance in the 2007–08 season but not since.

==Eligibility==
===Age eligibility===
To compete internationally on the senior level, skaters must be at least 17 before July 1 of the preceding year. To be eligible for junior-level events, a skater must be at least 13 but under 19 before that date (or 21 for male pair skaters and ice dancers). A skater must meet the age requirement &quot;before&quot; it becomes July 1 in their place of birth. For example, Adelina Sotnikova was born a few hours into July 1, 1996, in Moscow and consequently, was not eligible to compete at Junior Worlds until 2011 and senior Worlds until 2013. The ISU&#x27;s rules apply to international events. Many countries have no age requirements for domestic non-ISU competitions, thus, some skaters compete at the senior level nationally while not eligible for international competition.

The ISU has modified its age rules several times. Before the 1990s, 12 was the minimum age for senior international competitions. New rules were introduced in 1996, requiring skaters to be at least 15 before July 1 of the preceding year to compete at the Olympics, Worlds, Europeans, or Four Continents. The minimum age for all other senior internationals was 14 until July 2014, when it was raised to 15. The age limit was then raised to 16 years old for the 2023–24 season before increasing to 17 for the 2024–25 season, in a move to raise the age limit gradually. The move came after the 2022 Winter Olympics scandal over Kamila Valieva&#x27;s doping allegations and the controversy over her responsibility as a minor.

During the 2005–06 season, Mao Asada of Japan was age-eligible to compete at the Grand Prix Final, where she claimed the title, but she was not permitted to compete at the Olympics. For the 2008 World Championships, the United States was obliged to send skaters who had placed 5th and 7th at nationals because higher-placed skaters were too young, including a skater who missed the cutoff by 20 days. The ISU has strictly enforced the rules in recent years. However, American pair skater Natasha Kuchiki was allowed to compete at the 1990 World Championships when she was two years too young and American single skater Tara Lipinski, who was 13 at the time the 1996 rules were introduced, was grandfathered into remaining eligible for future events, along with other skaters who had already competed at the World Championships. A loophole also existed for a few years for underage skaters who had medaled at Junior Worlds.

As in gymnastics, skating has experienced controversy surrounding possible age falsification. On February 14, 2011, questions emerged surrounding nine Chinese skaters. The Associated Press found that birthdates listed on the Chinese Skating Association&#x27;s website suggested five female skaters, Sui Wenjing, Zhang Dan, Yu Xiaoyu, Geng Bingwa, and Xu Binshu, were younger than their ISU ages, and four male skaters, Han Cong, Zhang Hao, Jin Yang, and Gao Yu, were older. The dates disappeared from the website by February 15. On February 17, the ISU said there were no discrepancies for Zhang Dan, Zhang Hao, and Xu Binshu between the birthdates listed on their passports, ISU registration forms and the Chinese Olympic Committee&#x27;s website. Athletes in China sometimes face pressure to falsify their age.

===Other eligibility rules===
Skaters may represent a country of which they are not yet a citizen in most competitions, except the Olympics which require citizenship.

At most international events, each country may send one to a maximum of three entries per discipline. Consequently, even if a skater has a high season&#x27;s best, he or she may not be sent to major events if their country has many good skaters in their discipline. Some skaters have tried to circumvent this by representing another country. In response, the ISU introduced rules barring skaters from international events for a certain period of time. In the 2010 regulations, it was 24 months or more from the date of the last ISU Championship. In the 2012 regulations, the minimum was 18 months for singles and 12 months for pairs/ice dancers from the date of their last ISU Championships (Worlds, Europeans, Four Continents, Junior Worlds) and 12 months if they competed in some other international competition. Competitors may sit out for much longer because they also have to obtain a release from their previous federation. The ISU has set no limit to how long a country may hold skaters.

Skaters may lose their ISU eligibility if they perform in an unsanctioned show or competition.

Beginning in the 2010–11 season, minimum scores were introduced for the World, European, or Four Continents Championships. In the 2011–12 season, different minimum scores were introduced for the Grand Prix series.

==Competitors&#x27; expenses, income, and funding==
Figure skating is an expensive sport. This is particularly due to the costs of ice time and coaching. In the late 1980s, the expenses of a top-ten women&#x27;s competitor at the U.S. Championships reached nearly US$50,000 a year. In October 2004, a U.S. Figure Skating article estimated the annual expense at US$9,000–$10,000 for pre-juvenile, US$18,000 for juvenile, US$35,000–$40,000 for novice, and said junior and senior levels were somewhat more expensive. In the 2010s, American senior national medalists had expenses in the mid-five-figure range. Swiss skater Stéphane Lambiel said his costs were around CHF 100,000 per season. World champion Patrick Chan&#x27;s expenses were Can$150,000. In 2015, CBC Sports estimated that a Canadian pair team had expenses of about Can$100,000 per year.

Prize money is relatively low compared to other sports. A men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s singles skater who won the 2011 World Championships earned US$45,000, about 1.8% to 2.5% of the US$1,800,000–$2,400,000 for winners of the tennis US Open and Australian Open. A couple who won the pairs or ice dance title split US$67,500. A winner of the senior Grand Prix Final in December 2011 earned US$25,000.

Some national associations provide funding to some skaters if they meet certain criteria. Many skaters take part-time jobs and some have tried crowdfunding. In Germany, many elite skaters join the army to fund their skating. In Italy, some skaters join police agencies&#x27; sport groups, such as the Polizia Penitenziaria&#x27;s &quot;Fiamme Azzurre&quot; (Carolina Kostner, Anna Cappellini, Luca Lanotte) or Polizia di Stato&#x27;s &quot;Fiamme Oro&quot; (Federica Faiella, Paolo Bacchini). Some competitive skaters depend on income from shows. Shows must be sanctioned by their association, i.e. skaters may lose their competitive eligibility if they take part without permission. In some cases, skaters may feel pressure to compete through injury to be allowed to perform in a show.
Others may become involved with coaching younger athletes in order to fund their own training costs.

==Injuries and health issues==
In some countries, medical personnel may be slow to respond to accidents. At the 2000 World Championships in Nice, France, a pair skater who had been injured in a lift accident lay on the ice for several minutes and had to get up and leave the ice on his own before being offered medical attention.

===Head injuries, falls and collisions===

Competitive skaters generally do not wear helmets or other protective gear. There is a risk of head injuries, particularly in pair skating as a result of falls from lifts. Although pair skaters are most susceptible, serious head injuries can occur in all disciplines, including ice dance. Partners have accidentally slashed each other with their skate blades. This may occur when partners drift too close during side-by-side camel spins. Several female pair skaters have suffered head/face injuries during this element, including Elena Berezhnaya, Tatiana Totmianina, Jessica Dubé, Mandy Wötzel, Galina Maniachenko (Efremenko), and Elena Riabchuk.

Commenting on falls and concussions, Madison Hubbell said that &quot;Most of the time, the worst falls are on things we kind of take for granted.&quot; Shin splints, knee injuries, and back problems are not uncommon. Hip damage may occur as a result of practising jumps and throws. In rare cases, intensive training of spins may result in subtle concussions (Lucinda Ruh).

Injuries have also been sustained by skaters from different teams when many skaters are practising on the ice. Midori Ito collided with Laetitia Hubert at the 1991 World Championships, while Oksana Baiul and Tanja Szewczenko collided at the 1994 Olympics, but all went on to compete. At the 2014 Cup of China the Japanese Yuzuru Hanyu, winner of the Olympic title a few months before, and the Chinese Han Yan, collided during the warm up of the free program. Despite being visibly injured, both skaters finished the competition. On practice sessions with multiple skaters on the ice, the skater whose music is playing conventionally has right of way. Also, pairs and ice dancers skating as a unit have right of way over those skating separately as changing course is more difficult for a couple.

===Eating disorders and RED–S===

Eating disorders are reportedly common in figure skating and can result in the development of relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S), formerly known as the &quot;female athlete triad&quot;. RED-S is a syndrome of three interrelated conditions which can cause long-standing illness in girls and women and even death. Body image and the need to maintain a fit body is a very common issue in figure skating, as skaters age, their bodies change and change the way they must approach the sport. Skaters such as Gracie Gold, and Ashley Wagner  have faced issues such as eating disorders and depression.

===Doping===
Figure skaters occasionally have positive doping results but it is not common. In a 1991 interview, three-time Olympic champion Irina Rodnina admitted that Soviet skaters used doping substances in preparation for the competitive season, stating: &quot;Boys in pairs and singles used drugs, but this was only in August or September. This was done just in training, and everyone was tested (in the Soviet Union) before competitions.&quot;

==History==

Although people have been ice skating for centuries, figure skating in its current form originated in the mid-19th century. &quot;A Treatise on Skating&quot; (1772) by the accomplished skater, Welshman Lt. &#x27;Captain&#x27; Robert Jones (), is the first-known book on figure skating. He designed skates that could be attached to shoes by screws through the heels (rather than using straps), and these were soon available from Riccard&#x27;s Manufactory in London.
Competitions were held in the &quot;English style&quot; of skating, which was stiff and formal and bore very little resemblance to modern figure skating. Without changing the basic techniques used by skaters, only a limited number of figure skating moves could be performed. This was still true in the mid-1800s before improvements were brought about by American skater Jackson Haines, who was considered to be the &quot;father of modern figure skating&quot;. In the mid-1860s, Haines introduced a new style of skating, incorporating free and expressive techniques, which became known as the &quot;international style&quot;. Although popular in Europe, the international style of skating was not widely adopted in the United States until long after Haines&#x27;s death.

===Early 1900s===
The International Skating Union was founded in 1892. The first European Figure Skating Championships were held in 1891 in Hamburg, Germany (won by Oskar Uhlig), and the first World Figure Skating Championships were held in 1896 in Saint Petersburg, Russia (won by Gilbert Fuchs). Only men competed in the early events but in 1902 a woman entered the World Championships for the first time: British female skater Madge Syers competed in the men&#x27;s competition, finishing in second place behind Sweden&#x27;s Ulrich Salchow. The ISU quickly banned women from competing against men, and established a separate &quot;ladies&quot; competition in 1906. Pair skating was introduced at the 1908 World Championships, where the title was won by Anna Hübler and Heinrich Burger of Germany.

Figure skating was the first winter sport contested at the Olympics; it made its Olympic debut at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. On March 20, 1914, an international figure skating championship was held in New Haven, Connecticut. This event was the forerunner of both the United States and Canadian National Championships. However, international competitions in figure skating were interrupted by World War I.

In the 1920s and 1930s, figure skating was dominated by Sonja Henie of Norway. Henie turned competitive success into a lucrative professional career as a movie star and touring skater, also setting the fashion for female skaters to wear short skirts and white boots. The top male figure skaters of this period included Sweden&#x27;s Gillis Grafström and Austria&#x27;s Karl Schäfer.

===After World War II===
Skating competitions were again interrupted for several years by World War II. After the war, with many European rinks in ruins, skaters from the United States and Canada began to dominate international competitions and to introduce technical innovations to the sport. Dick Button, 1948 and 1952 Olympic Champion, was the first skater to perform the double Axel and triple loop jumps, as well as the flying camel spin.

The World Figure Skating Championships did not include ice dance until 1952. In its early years, ice dance was dominated by British skaters, and until 1960 the world title was won every year by a British couple, beginning with Jean Westwood and Lawrence Demmy.
On February 15, 1961, the entire U.S. figure skating team and their coaches were killed in the crash of Sabena Flight 548 in Brussels, Belgium en route to the World Championships in Prague. This tragedy sent the U.S. skating program into a period of rebuilding.

Meanwhile, the Soviet Union rose to become a dominant force in the sport, especially in the disciplines of pair skating and ice dance. Soviet and Russian domination in pair skating began in the 1950s and continued throughout the rest of the 1900s. Only five non-Soviet or Russian teams won the Olympics and World Championships from 1965 to 2010. When Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo of China won the gold medal at the 2010 games, this was the first time since 1960 that a Russian, Soviet, or Unified Team (CIS) flagged team did not win the gold medal. The 1967 World Championships was the last event held on an outdoor rink.

===Effect of television and the present day===
Compulsory figures formerly accounted for up to 60% of the score in singles figure skating, meaning that skaters who could build up a significant lead in figures could win competitions even if they were mediocre free skaters. As television coverage of skating events became more important, the popularity of free skating increased because this part of the competition was televised and shown to the general public, whereas the compulsory figures competition was not. The television audience would complain when superior free programs sometimes failed to equate to gold medal victories. Beginning in 1968, the ISU progressively reduced the weighting of compulsory figures and introduced the short program in 1973. A critical issue was said to have been the continued failure of Janet Lynn to achieve on the world stage despite her outstanding free skate programs. For example, she missed out on a podium place at the 1971 World Championships after winning the free skate competition decisively, which produced an uproar and loud booing from the audience during the medal ceremony.

With these changes, the emphasis in competitive figure skating shifted to increased athleticism. Landing triple jumps during the short program and the free skate became more important. By the 1980s, some skaters began practising quadruple jumps. Jozef Sabovcik of Czechoslovakia landed a quad toe loop at the 1986 European Championships which was recognized at the event but then ruled invalid three weeks later due to a touchdown with his free foot. At the 1988 World Championships, Kurt Browning of Canada landed the first quad toe loop which has remained ratified. Despite expectations, it was several years before quads became an important part of men&#x27;s skating. In 1988, Japan&#x27;s Midori Ito became the first woman to land a triple Axel, pushing the athletic and technical level for women&#x27;s programs. Worth only 20% by 1989, compulsory figures were eliminated from international competition in 1990.
Television contributed to the sport&#x27;s popularity by showing skaters in the kiss and cry area after competing. Television also played a role in removing the restrictive amateur status rules that once governed the sport. In May 1990, the ISU voted to allow skaters intending to skate professionally to return to ISU competition, provided that they obtained their national association&#x27;s permission. In 1995, in an effort to retain skaters who might otherwise have given up their eligibility to participate in lucrative professional events, the ISU introduced prize money at its major competitions, funded by revenues from selling the TV rights to those events.

In 1984, more than 24 million people in Great Britain watched ice dance pair Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean earn unanimous 6.0s for presentation, the only perfect score in Olympic skating history, which was ranked the 8th greatest sporting moment in a UK poll. In the 1993 National Sports Study II, considered by the Associated Press as the largest study of spectator sport popularity in America, women&#x27;s figure skating was the second most popular spectator sport in America, just behind NFL football out of over 100 sports surveyed. The 1993 study found that three figure skatersDorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming, and Scott Hamiltonwere among the eight most popular athletes in the United States, of more than 800 athletes surveyed. Dorothy Hamill was statistically tied with Mary Lou Retton as the most popular athlete in America. The Tonya Harding scandal in 1994 increased interest in figure skating. The first night of the women&#x27;s figure skating competition in the 1994 Winter Olympics achieved higher Nielsen TV ratings than the Super Bowl three weeks earlier and, to that date, was the most watched sports television program of all time.

To show support, spectators sometimes throw a variety of items onto the ice after the end of a figure skating program, most commonly stuffed toys and flowers. Officials discourage people from throwing flowers that are not fully wrapped because of the possibility of debris disrupting or endangering the following skaters.

Countries that have produced a great many successful skaters include Russia and the former Soviet Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, China, France, Germany, and Italy. While the sport has grown in East Asia, training opportunities in South Asia are limited due to a scarcity of ice rinks. India had only four major indoor ice rinks as of 2011, but there were plans for ten more to be built, mostly in malls, over the following five years. As of 2016, three of these intended ten indoor rinks were built at Neptune Magnet Mall, Atria Millennium Mall, and Lulu Mall respectively.

Four skating has mostly disappeared, while synchronized skating, singles/pair skating and ice dance have grown. On April 6, 2011, the International Olympic Committee officially confirmed the approval of a figure skating team event, which was introduced at the 2014 Winter Olympics. The elimination of the compulsory dance segment provided space for the team event. Each team is composed of a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singles skater, a pair, and an ice dance duo. A maximum of ten teams can compete, with five eliminated after the short program. In December 2011, the ISU released details of the qualifying system and the competition.

According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, television helped figure skating become more celebrity oriented, with high-profile skaters being treated like entertainers and famous athletes in other sports. She states that television has encouraged &quot;casual fans and other members of the general public to understand skating in terms of media-shaped parables about broader cultural issues,&quot; including anxieties about femininity or masculinity, individuality versus conformity, and nationalistic sporting contests. Kestnbaum also states that even though most skating broadcasts are produced by networks&#x27; sports divisions, competitions, even the more serious ones, they are packaged with &quot;more emphasis on the aesthetic qualities of the skating—or of the female skaters—and on the pleasures of rooting for a home-country hero than on the technical details that determine the winners&quot;. Viewers who depend upon the televised coverage of figure skating are limited in their access to information about it as a sport because broadcasters present a week&#x27;s worth of competition in a few hours and they are compelled to avoid overloading viewers with too much information about the more technical aspects of the sport. Journalists and scholars who write about figure skating also tend to focus on the same broader cultural issues.

<doc id="11157" wikidata="Q940304" url="?curid=11157" title="Fudge (role-playing game system)">
<text>Fudge is a generic role-playing game system for use in freeform role-playing games. The name &quot;FUDGE&quot; was once an acronym for &quot;Freeform Universal Donated&quot; (later, &quot;Do-it-yourself&quot;) &quot;Gaming Engine&quot; and, though the acronym has since been dropped, that phrase remains a good summation of the game&#x27;s design goals. &quot;Fudge&quot; has been nominated for an Origins Award for &quot;Best Role-Playing Game System&quot; for the &quot;Deryni Adventure Game&quot;.

Rather than being a rigidly pre-defined set of rules like &quot;d20 System&quot; or &quot;GURPS&quot;, &quot;Fudge&quot; offers a customizable toolkit for building the users&#x27; own specialized role-playing game system. Such things as what attributes and skills will define characters are left to be determined by the Game Master and players, and several different optional systems for resolving actions and conflicts are offered. &quot;Fudge&quot; is not tied to any particular genre or setting and world builders are encouraged to invent appropriate attributes and rules tailored to the campaign.

== History ==
The project that would lead to &quot;Fudge&quot; was first proposed by Steffan O&#x27;Sullivan in November 1992 on the rec.games.design newsgroup, and over the following months that online community would contribute to the directed project. One of the earliest stipulations of O&#x27;Sullivan was that the basic system would always remain free to the public over the internet, and the PDF of the 1995 version still is. The 1995 version of &quot;Fudge&quot; is available under a non-commercial licence.

Grey Ghost Press, with the endorsement of Steffan O&#x27;Sullivan, publishes an expanded form of the &quot;Fudge&quot; system. There have been three Grey Ghost Press editions, the most current being the &quot;Fudge 10th Anniversary Edition&quot;, which includes several suggested rules systems for common RPG elements and an example basic fantasy &quot;build&quot; of the game.

In March 2004, Grey Ghost Press acquired the copyright of &quot;Fudge&quot;, and on April 6, 2005, they released a version of &quot;Fudge&quot; under the Open Game License.

The OGL license has allowed the &quot;Fate&quot; role-playing game system to build on &quot;Fudge&quot; as its underlying mechanic.

In 1999 &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named &quot;Fudge&quot; as one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Most Underrated Games&quot;. Editor Scott Haring stated &quot;&quot;Fudge&quot; is an extremely flexible, rules-light system. It works great, and everybody who plays it, loves it. Why isn&#x27;t it more popular? I dunno.&quot;

== Name==
At the time &quot;Fudge&quot; was conceived, it was stylish to give role-playing games acronyms for names (for instance, &quot;GURPS&quot; and &quot;TWERPS&quot;), and originally the usenet design project referred to the game as &quot;SLUG&quot;, for &quot;Simple Laid-back Universal Game&quot;. However, this was soon changed to &quot;FUDGE&quot; for &quot;Free-form Universal Donated Gaming Engine&quot;, but also because the word invoked connotations of an easy to make source of fun. This again was changed when Grey Ghost Press released their 1995 hard copy version of the game, to &quot;Free-form Universal Do-it-yourself Gaming Engine&quot;.

With the publication of the Expanded Edition in 2000, the fad for acronym-based names had long since faded, and the writer and the publisher both felt that the forced acronym had become irrelevant. The game has been referred to officially as just &quot;Fudge&quot; ever since, though fans often still refer to it in the old manner as &quot;FUDGE&quot;.

==Game mechanics==

In &quot;Fudge&quot;, character Traits such as Attributes and Skills, are rated on a seven-level, ascending adjective scale: &quot;Terrible, Poor, Mediocre, Fair, Good, Great,&quot; and &quot;Superb.&quot;

&quot;Fudge&quot; characters can also have Gifts and Faults, which are positive and negative traits that do not fit into the adjective scale.

===Fudge dice===

&quot;Fudge&quot; uses customized &quot;&quot;Fudge&quot; dice&quot; which have an equal number of plus, minus, and blank sides. A number of these dice are rolled, usually four at a time (&quot;4dF&quot; in Fudge dice notation), and for every plus side that comes up the result of using the Trait is considered one step higher (e.g. from &quot;Fair&quot; to &quot;Good&quot;) and for every minus side that comes up the result is considered one step lower. The goal is to match or surpass the difficulty level, also on the adjective scale, of the test. Thus, a &quot;Good&quot; attribute is considered to be &quot;Great&quot; if the player were to roll two plus sides, one minus side, and one blank—the minus side cancels out one of the plus sides and the remaining plus side raises the result by one step. The same &quot;Good&quot; attribute would be considered &quot;Poor&quot; if you were to roll three minus sides and one blank. The same dice roll can be achieved with six-sided dice, treating a 1 or 2 as [−], a 3–4 as [ ] and a 5–6 as [+].

There are also several alternative dice systems available that use ten-sided dice, coins, or playing cards.

==Complexity==
The rules of &quot;Fudge&quot; are highly customizable and can be adjusted for the level of simplicity or complexity desired by the Game Master and Players. Overall, the system is designed to encourage role-playing over strict adherence to a set of rules. In fact, the main &quot;Fudge&quot; documents encourage players to &quot;Just Fudge It&quot;; that is, to focus on the story being created rather than on the game rules. For example, one character creation method encourages players to first write prose descriptions of their characters and then translate those into &quot;Fudge&quot; Traits.

==Reception==
In the January 1996 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 225), Rick Swan called this game system &quot;a remarkable achievement, a concise, logical analysis of RPG theory that amateur and pro designers alike would do well to ponder.&quot; Although Swan liked the simplicity and logic of the open system, he felt that too much of the onus fell on the gamemaster. &quot;Not only must he role-play the NPCs, stage memorable encounters, and keep the story on track, he must also come up with Difficulty Levels for every conceivable situation. It ain&#x27;t easy.&quot; He concluded by giving the game a rating of 5 out of 6, saying, &quot;FUDGE is about as appropriate for novices as calculus is for preschoolers. Seasoned gamers, however, will be in for a pleasant surprise.&quot;

In Issue 17 of &quot;Shadis&quot;, Leonard Wilson was enthusiastic about this game system, writing, &quot;Simply put, from start to finish, FUDGE is the sort of quality product that can&#x27;t be mistaken for anything but a labor of love for everyone involved. If you&#x27;re a role-player who frequents the Internet anyway, you&#x27;ll be missing a real treasure if you don&#x27;t download yourself a copy. Even if you don’t frequent the Internet, if you&#x27;ve ever found yourself tinkering with the rules to a role-playing games, you&#x27;ll find it well worth the effort to track down a copy of FUDGE.&quot;

In Issue 3 of the French games magazine &quot;Backstab’&quot;, Stéphane Bura liked the game system, commenting &quot;This is, to my knowledge, the best system using a normal bell curve (frequent average results and rare extreme results) published to date ... Even if it requires some effort, FUDGE will satisfy those looking for a good generic system less complicated than &quot;GURPS&quot;.&quot; Bura concluded by giving the game system a rating of 8 out of 10.

In Issue 30 of the Australian game magazine &quot;Australian Realms&quot;, Mike Bell wrote, &quot;What lifts FUDGE to new heights of excellence [...] is the way it encourages and guides through designing your very own personalised RPG using the basic building blocks supplied by its author, Stefan O&#x27;Sullivan. Originally distributed via the Internet, buyers are actively encouraged to design and distribute their own FUDGE-based games so long as they include copyright notices and a disclaimer. Way cool!&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;Most people didn&#x27;t see it at the time, but &quot;FUDGE&quot; marks a fundamental change in RPGs. Simultaneously a system of rules and a treatise on game design theory, it questions many of the methods and mechanics that are taken for granted about roleplaying and reshapes those assumptions, paving the way for other games to continue pushing into new forms in the coming decades.&quot;
