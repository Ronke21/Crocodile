<text>Sir John Falstaff is a fictional character who appears in three plays by William Shakespeare and is eulogised in a fourth. His significance as a fully developed character is primarily formed in the plays &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;, where he is a companion to Prince Hal, the future King Henry V of England. Falstaff is also featured as the buffoonish suitor of two married women in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. Though primarily a comic figure, he embodies a depth common to Shakespeare&#x27;s major characters. A fat, vain, and boastful knight, he spends most of his time drinking at the Boar&#x27;s Head Inn with petty criminals, living on stolen or borrowed money. Falstaff leads the apparently wayward Prince Hal into trouble, and is repudiated when Hal becomes king.

Falstaff has appeared in other works, including operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Otto Nicolai, a &quot;symphonic study&quot; by Edward Elgar, and in Orson Welles&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot;. The operas focus on his role in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, while the film adapts the Henriad and &quot;The Merry Wives&quot;. Welles, who played Falstaff in his film, considered the character &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s greatest creation&quot;. The word &quot;Falstaffian&quot; has entered the English language with connotations of corpulence, jollity, and debauchery.

==Role in the plays== 
Falstaff appears in three of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays: &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, and &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. His death is mentioned in &quot;Henry V&quot;, but he has no lines, nor is it directed that he appear on stage. However, many stage and film adaptations have seen it necessary to include Falstaff for the insight he provides into King Henry V&#x27;s character. The most notable examples in cinema are Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1944 version and Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s 1989 film, both of which draw additional material from the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays.

The character is known to have been very popular with audiences at the time, and for many years afterwards. According to Leonard Digges, writing shortly after Shakespeare&#x27;s death, while many plays could not get good audiences, &quot;let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest, you scarce shall have a room&quot;.

===&quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;===

King Henry is troubled by the behaviour of his son and heir, the Prince of Wales. Hal (the future Henry V) has lost his authority at court and spends his time in taverns with low companions. He has become an object of scorn to the nobility and his worthiness to succeed his father is doubted. Hal&#x27;s main companion in enjoying the low life is Sir John Falstaff. Fat, old, drunk, and corrupt as he is, he has a charisma and a zest for life that captivates the Prince.

Hal likes Falstaff but makes no pretence of being like him. He enjoys insulting his dissolute friend and makes sport of him. He and Poins pretend to go along with a plan by Falstaff and three friends to carry out a highway robbery, but then attack the robbers in disguise and in turn steal their loot, after which Hal returns it to its owner. Hal tells the audience that he will soon abandon this life and assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change will gain him additional approval and earn him respect at court.

Falstaff, who has &quot;misused the King&#x27;s press damnably&quot;, by taking money from able-bodied men who wished to evade service and by keeping the wages of those he recruited who were killed in battle (&quot;food for powder, food for powder&quot;) is obliged to play a role in the Battle of Shrewsbury. Left on his own during Hal&#x27;s duel with Hotspur, he feigns death to avoid attack by Douglas. After Hal leaves both Hotspur and Falstaff on the field and being thought dead, Falstaff revives, stabs Hotspur&#x27;s corpse in the thigh and claims credit for the kill. Though Hal knows better, he is merciful to Falstaff, who subsequently states that he wants to amend his life and begin &quot;to live cleanly as a nobleman should do&quot;.

===&quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;===
The play focuses on Prince Hal&#x27;s journey toward kingship, and his ultimate rejection of Falstaff. However, unlike &quot;Part One&quot;, Hal&#x27;s and Falstaff&#x27;s stories are almost entirely separate, as the two characters meet only twice and very briefly. The tone of much of the play is elegiac, focusing on Falstaff&#x27;s age and his closeness to death, which parallels that of the increasingly sick king.

Falstaff is still drinking and engaging in petty criminality in the London underworld. He first appears, followed by a new character, a young page whom Prince Hal has assigned him as a joke. Falstaff enquires what the doctor has said about the analysis of his urine, and the page cryptically informs him that the urine is healthier than the patient. Falstaff delivers one of his most characteristic lines: &quot;I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men.&quot; Falstaff promises to outfit the page in &quot;vile apparel&quot; (ragged clothing). He then complains of his insolvency, blaming it on &quot;consumption of the purse.&quot; They go off, Falstaff vowing to find a wife &quot;in the stews&quot; (i.e., the local brothels).

The Lord Chief Justice enters, looking for Falstaff. Falstaff at first feigns deafness in order to avoid conversing with him. When this tactic fails, Falstaff pretends to mistake him for someone else. As the Chief Justice attempts to question Falstaff about a recent robbery, Falstaff insists on turning the subject of the conversation to the nature of the illness afflicting the King. He then adopts the pretense of being a much younger man than the Chief Justice: &quot;You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young.&quot; Finally, he asks the Chief Justice for one thousand pounds to help outfit a military expedition, but is denied.

He has a relationship with Doll Tearsheet, a prostitute, who gets into a fight with Ancient Pistol, Falstaff&#x27;s ensign. After Falstaff ejects Pistol, Doll asks him about the Prince. Falstaff is embarrassed when his derogatory remarks are overheard by Hal, who is present disguised as a musician. Falstaff tries to talk his way out of it, but Hal is unconvinced. When news of a second rebellion arrives, Falstaff joins the army again, and goes to the country to raise forces. There he encounters an old school friend, Justice Shallow, and they reminisce about their youthful follies. Shallow brings forward potential recruits for the loyalist army: Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, Shadow and Wart, a motley collection of rustic yokels. Falstaff and his cronies accept bribes from two of them, Mouldy and Bullcalf, not to be conscripted.

In the final scene, Falstaff, having learned from Pistol that Hal is now King, travels to London in expectation of great rewards. But Hal rejects him, saying that he has now changed, and can no longer associate with such people. The London lowlifes, expecting a paradise of thieves under Hal&#x27;s governance, are instead purged and imprisoned by the authorities.

===&quot;Henry V&quot;===

Although Falstaff does not appear on stage in &quot;Henry V&quot;, his death is the main subject of Act 2, Scene 3, in which Mistress Quickly delivers a memorable eulogy:

There is a similarity in Shakespeare&#x27;s description of the death of Falstaff, and in Plato&#x27;s description of the death of Socrates. In a description in Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Phaedo&quot;, after Socrates has drunk hemlock, the man who gave him the poisonfelt him, and after an interval examined his feet and legs; he then pinched his foot hard and asked if he would feel it, and Socrates said not. And then he felt his shins once more; and moving upwards in this way, he showed us that he was becoming cold and numb. He went on feeling him and said that when the coldness reached his heart, he would be gone.

===&quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;===

Falstaff arrives in Windsor very short on money. To obtain financial advantage, he decides to court two wealthy married women, Mistress Ford and Mistress Page. Falstaff decides to send the women identical love letters and asks his servants – Pistol and Nym – to deliver them to the wives. When they refuse, Falstaff sacks them, and, in revenge, the men tell Ford and Page (the husbands) of Falstaff&#x27;s intentions. Page is not concerned, but the jealous Ford persuades the Host of the Garter Inn to introduce him to Falstaff as a &#x27;Master Brook&#x27; so that he can find out Falstaff&#x27;s plans.

When the women receive the letters, each goes to tell the other, and they quickly find that the letters are almost identical. The &quot;merry wives&quot; are not interested in the ageing, overweight Falstaff as a suitor; however, for the sake of their own amusement and to gain revenge for his indecent assumptions towards them both, they pretend to respond to his advances.

This all results in great embarrassment for Falstaff. Mr. Ford poses as &#x27;Mr. Brook&#x27; and says he is in love with Mistress Ford but cannot woo her as she is too virtuous. He offers to pay Falstaff to court her, saying that once she has lost her honour he will be able to tempt her himself. Falstaff cannot believe his luck, and tells &#x27;Brook&#x27; he has already arranged to meet Mistress Ford while her husband is out. Falstaff leaves to keep his appointment and Ford soliloquises that he is right to suspect his wife and that the trusting Page is a fool.

When Falstaff arrives to meet Mistress Ford, the merry wives trick him into hiding in a laundry basket (&quot;buck basket&quot;) full of filthy, smelly clothes awaiting laundering. When the jealous Ford returns to try and catch his wife with the knight, the wives have the basket taken away and the contents (including Falstaff) dumped into the river. Although this affects Falstaff&#x27;s pride, his ego is surprisingly resilient. He is convinced that the wives are just playing hard to get with him, so he continues his pursuit of sexual advancement, with its attendant capital and opportunities for blackmail.

Again Falstaff goes to meet the women but Mistress Page comes back and warns Mistress Ford of her husband&#x27;s approach again. They try to think of ways to hide him other than the laundry basket which he refuses to get into again. They trick him again, this time into disguising himself as Mistress Ford&#x27;s maid&#x27;s obese aunt, known as &quot;the fat woman of Brentford&quot;. Ford tries once again to catch his wife with the knight but ends up beating the &quot;old woman&quot;, whom he despises, and throwing her out of his house. Black and blue, Falstaff laments his bad luck.

Eventually the wives tell their husbands about the series of jokes they have played on Falstaff, and together they devise one last trick which ends up with the Knight being humiliated in front of the whole town. They tell Falstaff to dress as &quot;Herne, the Hunter&quot; and meet them by an old oak tree in Windsor Forest (now part of Windsor Great Park). They then dress several of the local children as fairies and get them to pinch and burn Falstaff to punish him.

The wives meet Falstaff, and almost immediately the &quot;fairies&quot; attack. After the chaos, the characters reveal their true identities to Falstaff. Although he is embarrassed, Falstaff takes the joke surprisingly well, as he sees it was what he deserved. Ford says he must pay back the 20 pounds &#x27;Brook&#x27; gave him and takes the Knight&#x27;s horses as recompense. Eventually they all leave together and Mistress Page even invites Falstaff to come with them: &quot;let us every one go home, and laugh this sport o&#x27;er by a country fire; Sir John and all&quot;.

==Origins==
===John Oldcastle===
Shakespeare originally named Falstaff &quot;John Oldcastle&quot;, a real historical personage who died in 1417. Lord Cobham, a descendant of Oldcastle, complained, forcing Shakespeare to change the name. Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays and &quot;Henry V&quot; adapted and developed the material in an earlier play called &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry V&quot;, in which Sir John &quot;Jockey&quot; Oldcastle appears as a dissolute companion of the young Henry. Prince Hal refers to Falstaff as &quot;my old lad of the castle&quot; in the first act of the play; the epilogue to &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, moreover, explicitly disavows any connection between Falstaff and Oldcastle: &quot;Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man.&quot;

The historical Oldcastle was a knight from Herefordshire who became a Lollard who was executed for heresy and rebellion, and he was respected by many Protestants as a martyr. In addition to the anonymous &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry V&quot;, in which Oldcastle is Henry V&#x27;s companion, Oldcastle&#x27;s history is described in Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s usual source for his histories.

===Cobhams===
It is not clear, however, if Shakespeare characterised Falstaff as he did for dramatic purposes, or because of a specific desire to satirise Oldcastle or the Cobhams. Cobham was a common butt of veiled satire in Elizabethan popular literature; he figures in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; and may have been part of the reason &quot;The Isle of Dogs&quot; was suppressed. Shakespeare&#x27;s desire to burlesque a hero of early English Protestantism could indicate Roman Catholic sympathies, but Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham was sufficiently sympathetic to Catholicism that in 1603, he was imprisoned as part of the Main Plot to place Arbella Stuart on the English throne, so if Shakespeare wished to use Oldcastle to embarrass the Cobhams, he seems unlikely to have done so on religious grounds.

The Cobhams appear to have intervened while Shakespeare was in the process of writing either &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; or the second part of &quot;Henry IV&quot;. The first part of &quot;Henry IV&quot; was probably written and performed in 1596, and the name Oldcastle had almost certainly been allowed by Master of the Revels Edmund Tilney. William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham may have become aware of the offensive representation after a public performance; he may also have learned of it while it was being prepared for a court performance (Cobham was at that time Lord Chamberlain). As father-in-law to the newly widowed Robert Cecil, Cobham certainly possessed the influence at court to get his complaint heard quickly. Shakespeare may have included a sly retaliation against the complaint in his play &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (published after the &quot;Henry IV&quot; series). In the play, the paranoid, jealous Master Ford uses the alias &quot;Brook&quot; to fool Falstaff, perhaps in reference to William Brooke. At any rate, the name is Falstaff in the &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; quarto, of 1598, and the epilogue to the second part, published in 1600, contains this clarification:

===Sir John Fastolf===
The new name &quot;Falstaff&quot; probably derived from the medieval knight Sir John Fastolf. The historical Fastolf fought at the Battle of Patay against Joan of Arc, which the English lost. His previous career as a soldier had earned him wide respect but he seems to have become a scapegoat after the debacle. He was among the few English military leaders to avoid death or capture during the battle, and although there is no evidence that he acted with cowardice, he was temporarily stripped of his knighthood. Fastolf appears in &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot; in which he is portrayed as an abject coward. In the&quot; First Folio &quot;his name is spelled &quot;Falstaffe&quot;, so Shakespeare may have directly appropriated the spelling of the name he used in the earlier play.

===Robert Greene===
It has been suggested that the dissolute writer Robert Greene may also have been an inspiration for the character of Falstaff. This theory was first proposed in 1930 and has been championed by Stephen Greenblatt. Notorious for a life of dissipation and debauchery somewhat similar to Falstaff, he was among the first to mention Shakespeare in his work (in &quot;Greene&#x27;s Groats-Worth of Wit&quot;), suggesting to Greenblatt that the older writer may have influenced Shakespeare&#x27;s characterisation.

==Cultural adaptations==

There are several works about Falstaff, inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s plays:

===Literature===
*&quot;Falstaff&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1766), a drama by William Kenrick, was set after the events of &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;. To restore his financial position after his rejection by Hal, Falstaff is forced to marry Mistress Ursula (a character briefly mentioned by Shakespeare, whom Falstaff has &quot;weekly&quot; promised to marry). The play exists in two very different versions. In the first version Falstaff is drawn into Scroop&#x27;s plot to murder the king, but wins back Henry&#x27;s favour by exposing the plot. In the second this story is dropped for a purely farcical storyline.
*English lawyer and occasional writer George Radford sketched a &quot;biography&quot; of Falstaff based on clues drawn from plays in which the character appears, surmising, for example, that Falstaff was of Scandinavian descent and hailed from Norfolk.

===Music===

*&quot;Falstaff&quot; (1799), Antonio Salieri&#x27;s opera, with a libretto by Carlo Prospero Defranceschi, which is based upon &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;.
*&quot;Falstaff&quot; (1838), an opera by Michael William Balfe to an Italian libretto by S. Manfredo Maggione that is based upon &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;.
*&quot;Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor&quot; (1849) by Otto Nicolai, based upon &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;.
*&quot;Le songe d&#x27;une nuit d&#x27;été&quot; (1850), an opera by Ambroise Thomas in which Shakespeare and Falstaff meet.
*&quot;Falstaff&quot; (1893), Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s last opera, with a libretto by Arrigo Boito. It is mostly based upon &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;.
*&quot;Falstaff&quot; (1913), a &quot;symphonic study&quot; (or symphonic poem) by Edward Elgar, depicts Falstaff&#x27;s life.
*&quot;At the Boar&#x27;s Head&quot; (1925), a short opera by Gustav Holst based on the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays.
*&quot;Sir John in Love&quot; (1929), an opera by Ralph Vaughan Williams based upon &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;.
* &quot;Plump Jack&quot; (1985/2005), an opera with both libretto and music by Gordon Getty, adapted from the text of &quot;Henry IV&quot; and &quot;Henry V &quot;.

===Stage===
*&quot;Falstaff&quot; was a 1982 theater piece adapted from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays by Grey Cattell Johnson and Bill Cain. It was directed by Johnson and staged by the Boston Shakespeare Company.

===Film and television===
*On film, Falstaff appeared in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s acclaimed 1944 version of &quot;Henry V&quot;. Although Falstaff does not appear in the play, Olivier inserted an original scene depicting the fat knight – played by George Robey, who first previously performed the role in a stage production of &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; in 1935 – as a dying, heartbroken old man attended by Mistress Quickly, pathetically reliving in his mind his rejection by Henry. This was immediately followed by the actual scene from the play of Mistress Quickly describing Falstaff&#x27;s death to his grieving followers.
*Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; (1965) compiles the two &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays into a single, condensed storyline, while adding a handful of scenes from &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;. The film, also known as &quot;Falstaff&quot;, features Welles himself in the title role, with film critic Vincent Canby stating in 1975 that it &quot;may be the greatest Shakespearean film ever made, bar none&quot;.
*Falstaff appeared in the 1960 series &quot;An Age of Kings&quot;, which was actually a 15 part series depicting Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays from &quot;Richard II&quot; to &quot;Richard III&quot;; in the &quot;Henry IV&quot; episodes he was played by Frank Pettingell.
*In the 1979 season of the &quot;BBC Shakespeare&quot; series, in both parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot; Falstaff was played by Anthony Quayle, and in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; which followed in the 1982 season, by Richard Griffiths.
*In Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s acclaimed 1989 version of &quot;Henry V&quot;, Falstaff, here played by Robbie Coltrane, as in the Olivier version is given an original scene, this time dying in his bed and attended by Mistress Quickly, while downstairs his followers share a flashback – put together from various bits from both parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot; – showing the fat knight carousing with Henry back when he was &quot;madcap prince&quot; Hal, but it ends abruptly when the prince makes an ominous hint that some day when he becomes King he will be banishing his old friend. Later, prior to the actual scene where Mistress Quickly describes his death, there is a fleeting close-up shot of her sadly examining the knight&#x27;s now deceased body one last time before going downstairs to his followers.
*Falstaff appeared in the Michael Bogdanov/Michael Pennington&#x27;s English Shakespeare Company&#x27;s presentation of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays concerning &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;; originally taped live during their final tour with the series in 1989. In the &quot;Henry IV&quot; episodes, Falstaff was played by Barry Stanton, who later played the Chorus in &quot;Henry V&quot;. Although Falstaff never actually appeared in the production of &quot;Henry V&quot;, there is a humorous scene in silhouette prior to the scene where Mistress Quickly describing his funeral, depicting Falstaff&#x27;s funeral procession, with a group of soldiers staggering under the weight of his coffin (an obvious nod to the final scene in &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot;).
*Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; is partially a retelling of the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays, set in the contemporary US, and with the character of Bob Pigeon (William Richert) representing Falstaff. In the scene immediately following Bob&#x27;s first appearance in the film, Scott Favor (Keanu Reeves)the film&#x27;s version of Halis seen drinking from a bottle of Falstaff brand beer. Bob Pigeon&#x27;s final scene in the film mirrors that of Falstaff, with Scott/Prince Hal delivering a version of the famous &quot;I know thee not, old man&quot; speech.
*In the 2012 television series &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot;, which likewise consisted of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays concerning the &quot;Wars of the Roses&quot;, Falstaff was played by Simon Russell Beale. Just as in Olivier&#x27;s and Branagh&#x27;s film versions of &quot;Henry V&quot;, the Falstaff in this series appeared in the &quot;Henry V&quot; episode as well the &quot;Henry IV&quot; ones, sadly recollecting his rejection by his former friend while he is dying.
*In Phyllida Lloyd&#x27;s 2017 all-female Donmar Warehouse production of &quot;Henry IV&quot; (combining both parts), which was videotaped and broadcast, Sophie Stanton played Falstaff.
*In the 2019 Netflix film &quot;The King&quot;, Falstaff (played by Joel Edgerton) proposes to Henry V the military tactics employed by the English in the Battle of Agincourt and dies in the battle.
*In the comedy series &quot;Upstart Crow&quot;, William Shakespeare, played by David Mitchell, is inspired by his wastrel father&#x27;s antics to create a character called &quot;John Foulstuff&quot;.

*James White&#x27;s book &quot;Falstaff&#x27;s Letters&quot; (1796) purports to be a collection of letters written by Falstaff, provided by a descendant of Mistress Quickly&#x27;s sister.

<text>Floorball (also known by other names) is a sport played with five players and a goalkeeper in each team. It is played indoors with sticks and a hollow plastic ball with holes. Matches are played in three periods. The sport of bandy also played a role in the game&#x27;s development.

The game was invented in Sweden in the late 1960s. The basic rules were established in 1979 when the first floorball club in the world, Sala IBK, from Sala, was founded in Sweden. Official rules for matches were first written down in 1981.

The sport is organized internationally by the International Floorball Federation (IFF). As of 2019, there were about 377,000 registered floorball players worldwide, up from around 300,000 in 2014. Events include an annual Champions Cup, EuroFloorball Cup and EuroFloorball Challenge for club teams and the biennial World Floorball Championships with separate divisions for men and women. Men&#x27;s semi-professional club leagues include Finland&#x27;s F-liiga, Sweden&#x27;s Svenska Superligan, Switzerland&#x27;s Unihockey Prime League, and the Czech Republic&#x27;s Superliga florbalu. Women&#x27;s semi-professional leagues from the same countries are F-liiga, Svenska Superligan, Unihockey Prime League and Extraliga žen.

While the IFF contains 80 members, floorball is most popular where it has been developed the longest, such as the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. It is gaining popularity in Australia, New Zealand, India, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

Floorball was included in the World Games for the first time in 2017 in Wrocław, Poland, where Sweden became the first team to win a gold medal.

== Etymology ==
The game of floorball is also known by many other names, such as (in Estonia), (in Finland), (in Sweden and Norway), unihockey (in Switzerland and Ireland), unihokej (in Poland), and (in Lithuania). The names and are derived from &quot;bandy&quot; and translate to &quot;hall bandy&quot; and &quot;indoor bandy&quot; respectively. In Sweden, voices have been raised to get rid of the word as name of the sport, to avoid confusions with bandy. The name &quot;unihockey&quot; is shortened from &quot;universal hockey&quot; since it is meant to be a special and simplified hockey form.

== History ==

In various forms the game of floor hockey has been played since the early 20th Century in Canada as a recreational sport, especially in high school gymnasiums, as a playful variant of hockey. The basic design of floorball sticks is believed to have come from the ice skating team sport of bandy.

By the 1950s and 1960s many public school systems within Michigan in the United States incorporated floorball into their primary and secondary school gym classes. Americans have since claimed to have invented floorball. America held interstate tournaments in the 1960s.

Floorball was formally organized as an international and more organized sport in the late 1970s in Gothenburg, Sweden. The sport began as something that was played for fun as a pastime in schools. After a decade or so, floorball began showing up in Nordic countries where the former schoolyard pastime was becoming a developed sport. Formal rules were soon developed, and clubs began to form. After some time, several countries developed national associations, and the IFF was founded in 1986.

=== Expansion ===

When the IFF was founded in 1986, the sport was played mostly in the Nordic countries, several parts of the rest of Europe and Japan. By 1990, floorball was recognized in 7 countries, and by the time of the first European Floorball Championships in 1994, the number had risen to 14. That number included the United States, who was the first country outside Europe and Asia to recognize floorball. By the time of the first men&#x27;s world championships in 1996, 20 nations played floorball, with 12 of them participating at the tournament.

Currently the IFF has 80 members, in addition to recognizing 11 other countries with ongoing floorball development. Of its members, 58 have national floorball associations that are recognized by the IFF. With the addition of Sierra Leone, Africa&#x27;s first floorball nation, the IFF has at least one national association on each continent of the world, with the exception of Antarctica.

=== Development ===
10 years after the IFF was founded, the first world championships were played, with a sold out final of 15,106 people at the Globen in Stockholm, Sweden. In addition to that, the world&#x27;s two largest floorball leagues, Finland&#x27;s Salibandyliiga and Sweden&#x27;s Svenska Superligan were formed, in 1986 and 1995 respectively.

==== Recognition ====
In December 2008, the IFF and the sport of floorball received recognition from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). In July 2011, the IOC officially welcomed the IFF into its family of Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF). This will pave the way for floorball to enter the official sport programme. The IFF hoped that this recognition would help allow floorball to become a part of the 2020 Summer Olympics. As of 2024, the IOC has not announced any plans to add floorball to future Olympic games.

In January 2009, the IFF and the sport of floorball received recognition from the Special Olympics.

In addition to recognition by the IOC and Special Olympics, the IFF is also a member of the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF, formerly SportAccord), and co-operates with the International University Sports Federation (FISU). Floorball is now also member of IWGA, which runs the World Games, and floorball was on the programme for the first time in Wrocław 2017.

== World championships ==

The world floorball championships is annual event, but each class only meet every other year—the men and women under 19 meet in even years, and the women and men under 19 meet in odd years. The Czech Republic, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland remain the only five countries to have ever captured a medal at a World Championship event.
* The Men&#x27;s World Floorball Championship takes place every December (since 2008) in every even year.
* The Women&#x27;s World Floorball Championship takes place every December (since 2009) in every odd year.
* The Men&#x27;s under-19 World Floorball Championship takes place every May (since 2009) in every odd year.
* The Women&#x27;s under-19 World Floorball Championships takes place every May (since 2008) in every even year.

From 1996 to 2009, the IFF used a World Floorball Championship format where the last team in the A-Division was relegated to the B-Division, while the top team in the B-Division was promoted to the A-Division. This format caused much hardship for countries such as Australia, Canada, Slovakia, and Spain, who have all been trying to get to the B-Division from the C-Division since 2004. In 2010, the IFF adopted a FIFA-like continental qualification system, where teams must qualify to play at the world championships. Depending on the number of countries registered per continent or region, the IFF gives spots for the world championships. For example, Argentina, Brazil, Canada and the United States would need to play for one spot at the world championships in a continental qualification tournament for the Americas.

== Gameplay ==
=== Measurements ===
Floorball is played indoors on a rink whose size can officially vary from wide to long, and which is surrounded by high enclosed boards with rounded corners. The goals are wide and high. Their depth is and they are from the end of the nearest boards. Face-off dots are marked on the center line. Dots are also marked from both sides of the rink on the goal lines imaginary extensions. The dots do not exceed in diameter. They do not have to be dots, they can also be crosses.

=== Equipment ===

Typical equipment for a floorball player consists of a stick, a pair of shorts, a shirt, socks, and indoor sport shoes. Players may wear shin guards, eye protectors and protective padding for vital areas although most do not. Protective eyewear is, in some countries, compulsory for junior players.

A floorball stick is short compared with one for ice hockey; the maximum size for a stick is . As a stick cannot weigh any more than , floorball sticks are often made of carbon and composite materials. The blade of the stick can either be &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot; which indicates which way stick is supposed to be held from the player&#x27;s point of view. A player who is right-handed will often use a &quot;left&quot; blade since they will be holding the stick to right, and the other way around for left-handed people.

=== Goalkeepers ===

Goalkeepers wear limited protection provided by padded pants, a padded chest protector, knee pads and a helmet. Some goalkeepers like to wear gloves and/or wristbands The goalkeeper may also wear other protective equipment such as elbow pads and jock straps but bulky padding is not permitted. Goalkeepers do not use sticks and may use their hands to play the ball when they are within the goalkeeper&#x27;s box. There, they are allowed to throw the ball out to their teammates provided that the ball touches the ground before the half court mark. They can assist but not score. When they are completely outside the box, goalkeepers are considered field players and are not allowed to touch the ball with their hands.

=== Ball ===

A floor ball weighs and its diameter is . It has 26 holes in it, each of which are in diameter. Many of these balls now are made with aerodynamic technology, where the ball has over a thousand small dimples in it that reduce air resistance. There have been several times where a ball has been recorded to have traveled at a speed of approximately .

== Forms ==

=== 3v3 ===
This modality works almost the same as the normal 5v5 one, but with only 3 field players per team. Goalkeepers have a bag full of balls behind the goal, and they will play one if the current ball goes out the field. They can score directly if the ball bounces before the midfield line. Game time is divided in 2 parts of 10 minutes each with semi-effective time (only stops on goals or interruptions led by the referee) and a 2-minute break.

First 3vs3 World Floorball Championships were celebrated in Lahti (11-12 May 2024) with Finland winning the female tournament and Latvia doing the same in the male category. This WFC format is expected to be celebrated each year.
=== Freebandy ===
Freebandy is a sport that developed in the 2000s from floorball fanatics who specialize in a technique called &quot;zorro&quot;, which involves lifting the ball onto a stick and allowing air resistance and fast movements to keep the ball &quot;stuck&quot; to the stick. This technique is also referred to as &quot;airhooking&quot; or &quot;skyhooking&quot;. In freebandy, the rules are very much the same of those of floorball, with the exception of high nets and no infractions for high sticking. As well, the sticks are slightly tweaked from those of a floorball variety to include a &quot;pocket&quot; where the ball can be placed.

=== Special Olympics ===
Floorball at the Special Olympics is slightly modified from the &quot;regular&quot; form of floorball. Matches are played 3-on-3 with a goaltender, on a smaller court that measures long by wide. This form of floorball was developed for the intellectually disabled, and has yet to be played at the Special Olympics. Floorball was played as a demonstration sport at the 2013 Special Olympics World Winter Games, and was played as an official sport at the games in 2017.

=== Streetbandy ===

A simplified less formal version of floorball, played with smaller team numbers and shorter periods, and typically outdoors on various surfaces, including AstroTurf. In its most basic form, it is an informal pick up game amongst friends. However, a more formal version is played in Sweden, with the following structure:
* three field players on each team, with smaller overall team sizes (including subs.)
* small goals, with no goalie
* smaller playing area, usually closer to a half rink.
* 10-minute length.
* tendency towards &quot;first team to score 5 goals in the time limit&quot; rather than traditional scoring. Sudden death on a draw.
* penalties are taken from the centre line.
* most situations arising from the ball leaving play are resumed from a fixed point (e.g. corner, centre line)
* no physical contact, high sticks or dangerous activity allowed.

=== Swiss floorball ===
Swiss floorball called unihockey is a revised version of a floorball match. The match is played on a slightly smaller court and often involves only three field players playing on each side, in 3-on-3 floorball. This form of floorball is also slightly shorter, with only two periods of 15 to 20 minutes each played. In Switzerland this form of playing is called &quot;smallcourt&quot; (Kleinfeld), opposed to the usual style of playing on a bigger court, which is called &quot;bigcourt&quot; (Grossfeld).

=== Wheelchair floorball ===

Originally developed for players with disabilities, wheelchair floorball is played with exactly the same rules as &quot;regular&quot; floorball. Players use the same stick and ball, and goaltenders are also allowed to play.

The first ever IFF-sanctioned wheelchair floorball matches were played between the men&#x27;s teams of the Czech Republic and Sweden during the 2008 Men&#x27;s World Floorball Championships in Prague.

In addition to this, there is also an electric wheelchair variation.

== Rules ==

Each team can field six players at a time on the court, one player being a goalkeeper. But the coach can take the goalkeeper off and substitute them for a field player whenever they like, although it usually only happens in the end to increase the chances of scoring with one more outfield player. This can bring an advantage for the attacking side of the team but also disadvantages when it comes to their own defense. Both teams are also allowed to change players any time in the game; usually, a change comprises the whole team. Individual substitution happens sometimes, but usually only when a player is exhausted or hurt.

A floorball game is officially played over three periods lasting 20 minutes each (15 minutes for juniors). The clock is stopped in the case of penalties, goals, time-outs and any situation where the ball is not considered to be in play. The signal of a timeout is a triple honking sound. An intermission of 10 minutes (or maximum 15 minutes in some competitions) takes place between each period, where teams change ends and substitution areas. Each team is allowed one timeout of 30 seconds, which is often used late in matches. There are two referees to oversee the game, each with equal authority. If a game ends in a tie, teams play ten minutes extra, and the team that scores first wins. If the game is still drawn after extra-time, a penalty shootout similar to ice-hockey decides the winner.

Checking is prohibited in floorball. Controlled shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed but ice hockey-like checking is forbidden. Pushing players without the ball or competing for a loose ball is also disallowed, and many of these infractions lead to two-minute penalties. The best comparison in terms of legal physical contact is Association football (soccer), where checking is used to improve one&#x27;s positioning in relation to the ball rather than to remove an opposing player from the play. In addition to checking, players cannot lift an opponent&#x27;s stick or perform any stick infractions in order to get to the ball. Moreover, players may not raise their stick or play the ball above knee level, and a stick may not be placed in between a player&#x27;s legs. Passing the ball by foot is allowed more than once, following a rule change from 2022. Passing by hand or head deliberately may result in a two minutes penalty for the offending player. A field player may not enter the marked goal area and playing without stick is prohibited.

When a player commits a foul or when the ball is deemed unplayable, play is resumed from a free hit or a face-off. A free hit means that a player from one of the teams restarts the play from the place where the ball was last deemed unplayable. A comparable situation to this is a free kick in association football. For many fouls, such as stick infractions, a free hit is the only disciplinary action prescribed. However, at their own discretion the referee may additionally award a two or five minute penalty to the offending player. In that case, the player who committed the foul has to leave the field and sit out his punishment in a dedicated penalty area, leaving his team shorthanded for the time of the penalty. If an &#x27;extreme&#x27; foul is committed, such as physical contact or unsportsmanlike conduct, a player may receive a 10-minute personal penalty.

=== Penalties ===

Two-minute penalties can arise from a number of infractions and result in the offending player being sat on a penalty seat next to the scorers/timekeepers and away from the team benches. Each penalty has a specific code that is recorded on the official match record along with the time of the foul. The team of the offending player will play short-handed for the full length of the penalty. The codes are as follows;

== Competitions ==

In addition to the Floorball World Championships, there are other IFF Events for club teams such as the Champions Cup which is for the national competition winners from the Top-4 ranked nations, and the EuroFloorball Cup for the national competition winners from the 5th and lower ranked nations. There are also many international floorball club competitions.

=== Asia Pacific Floorball Championship ===

The Asia Pacific Floorball Championships are played every single year in New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, or Japan. The event was created by the Singapore Floorball Association together with the cooperation of the Asia Oceania Floorball Confederation (AOFC). Members of the AOFC get together during this tournament to play for the Asia Pacific Floorball Championship every year.

As of 2010, the Asia Pacific Floorball Championship is also the qualifying tournament for the World Floorball Championships.

=== Canada Cup ===

The Canada Cup is an international club tournament that is held every year in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the largest floorball club tournament outside of Europe, and attracts 55+ clubs from worldwide, every year.

=== Czech Open ===

The world&#x27;s largest club team tournament, the Czech Open is a traditional summer tournament held in Prague, Czech Republic. It is famous not only for its on-court activities, but also for those off-court. The tournament attracts 200+ clubs every year from 20 countries.

=== Champions Cup ===

The Champions Cup was played for the first time in 2011. It is now the premier IFF event for Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Club teams. The national championship winners from the Top-4 ranked nations compete in the event.

=== EuroFloorball Cup ===
The EuroFloorball Cup (formerly European Cup) is an IFF-organised club event for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. It has taken place every single year since 1993, and in 2000 it changed its format to a 2-year event (i.e. 2000–01). In 2008, the tournament switched back to its one-year format. In 2011 it underwent another change when the Champions Cup was introduced for the first time.

The EuroFloorball Cup (EFC) is now for the national competition winners from the 5th and lower ranked nations. Qualification can be made via a number of processes. Firstly, the teams from the 5th, 6th &amp; 7th ranked nations receive automatic qualification. A team nominated by the local event organiser also gets automatic qualification, and then the last two spots are determined by qualification tournaments.

=== North American Floorball League ===

The North American Floorball League is the first and only semi professional floorball league outside of Europe. It is not affiliated with any federation, so it has players from around the world. The inaugural set of teams are entirely based in the United States, though there is potential for expansion into Canada.

<doc id="11250" wikidata="Q9448" url="?curid=11250" title="Premier League">
<text>The Premier League is a professional association football league in England and the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches: two against each other team, one home and one away. Most games are played on weekend afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.

The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992, following the decision of First Division (the top-tier league from 1888 until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League. However, teams are still relegated to and promoted from the EFL Championship at the conclusion of each season. The Premier League is a corporation managed by a chief executive, with member clubs acting as shareholders. The Premier League takes advantage of a £5 billion television rights deal, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games, respectively. This deal will rise to £6.7 billion for the four seasons from 2025 to 2029. The league is projected to earn $7.2 billion in overseas TV rights from 2022 to 2025. Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to EFL clubs.

The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes, with a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. For the 2023–24 season, the average Premier League match attendance was 38,375, second to the German Bundesliga&#x27;s 39,512, whilst aggregated attendance across all matches in a 38-game season is the highest of any association football league. Most stadium occupancies are near capacity. , the Premier League is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, ahead of Spain&#x27;s La Liga. The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of European Cup / UEFA Champions League titles, with a record six English clubs having won fifteen European cups in total.

Fifty-one clubs have competed in the Premier League since its inception in 1992: 49 from England and 2 from Wales. Seven have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (8), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1), and Liverpool (1). Only six clubs have played in every season to date: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.

==History==
===Origins===
Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were deteriorating with poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster between the fans of Liverpool Football Club and the fans of Juventus in 1985. The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy&#x27;s Serie A and Spain&#x27;s La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.

By the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football&#x27;s governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster; between the fans of Liverpool and the fans of Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, Yorkshire on 15 April 1989, was published in January 1990.

During the 1980s, major English clubs began to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation. The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in doing so, they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986. They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches, and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received £6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44 million over four years, with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash. According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988. The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a &quot;super league&quot;, but they were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion&#x27;s share of the deal. The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that, in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the whole of the First Division with them instead of a smaller &quot;super league&quot;. By the beginning of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrades as proposed by the Taylor Report.

In 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the &quot;big five&quot; football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton, and Arsenal) over a dinner. The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from the Football League. Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money. The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of the Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not have an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it a way to weaken the Football League&#x27;s position. The FA released a report in June 1991, &quot;Blueprint for the Future of Football&quot;, that supported the plan for the Premier League, with the FA as the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.

===Founding and Manchester United dominance (1990s)===
At the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991, by the game&#x27;s top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League. The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe. Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on &quot;Match of the Day&quot;.

Luton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season. They were replaced by Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough, and Blackburn Rovers, promoted from the old Second Division. The 22 First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year, the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association&#x27;s then headquarters in Lancaster Gate. The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:
*Arsenal
*Aston Villa
*Blackburn Rovers
*Chelsea
*Coventry City
*Crystal Palace
*Everton
*Ipswich Town
*Leeds United
*Liverpool
*Manchester City
*Manchester United
*Middlesbrough
*Norwich City
*Nottingham Forest
*Oldham Athletic
*Queens Park Rangers
*Sheffield United
*Sheffield Wednesday
*Southampton
*Tottenham Hotspur
*Wimbledon
This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions, with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.

The league held its first season in 1992–93. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season (reduced to 20 in the 1995–96 season). The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United.

Manchester United won the inaugural edition of the new league, ending a twenty-six year wait to be crowned champions of England. Bolstered by this breakthrough, United immediately became the competition&#x27;s dominant team, winning seven of the first nine trophies, two League and FA Cup &#x27;doubles&#x27; and a European treble, initially under a team of hardened veterans such as Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Eric Cantona, before Cantona, Bruce, and Roy Keane led a young, dynamic new team filled with the Class of 92, a group of young players including David Beckham who came through the Manchester United Academy.

Between 1993 and 1997, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United came close to challenging Manchester United&#x27;s early dominance; Blackburn won the 1994–95 FA Premier League and Newcastle led the title charge over United for much of the 1995–96 season. As the decade closed, Arsenal replicated Manchester United&#x27;s dominance by winning the League and FA Cup double in 1997–98, and together they would form a duopoly over the league between 1997 and 2003.

===Emergence of the &quot;Big Four&quot; (2000s)===
The 2000s saw the rise of Liverpool alongside the &quot;Big 2&quot;, followed by Chelsea finally breaking the Arsenal–Man United duopoly by winning the league in 2004–05. The dominance of the so-called &quot;Big Four&quot; clubsArsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester Unitedsaw them finish at the top of the table for most of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third.

Following the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname &quot;The Invincibles&quot; as they became the first and, to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.

In May 2008, Kevin Keegan stated that &quot;Big Four&quot; dominance threatened the division: &quot;This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.&quot; Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: &quot;There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you&#x27;re at the top, in the middle, or at the bottom that make it interesting.&quot;

Between 2005 and 2012, there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals, with only the &quot;Big Four&quot; clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008), and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008), and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals. Leeds United were the only non-&quot;Big Four&quot; side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000–01 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006–07, 2007–08, and 2008–09, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002–03 and La Liga in 1999–2000).

Additionally, between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached the UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006), and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.

Although the group&#x27;s dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of Manchester City and Tottenham, in terms of all-time Premier League points won, they remain clear by some margin. As of the end of the 2021–22 season – the 30th season of the Premier League – Liverpool, in fourth place in the all-time points table, were over 300 points ahead of the next team, Tottenham Hotspur. They are also the only teams to maintain a winning average of over 50% throughout their entire Premier League tenures.

===Emergence of the &quot;Big Six&quot; (2010s)===

The years following 2009 marked a shift from the &quot;Big Four&quot; with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the &quot;Big Four&quot; into the &quot;Big Six&quot;. In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first new team to finish in the top four since Everton five years prior. Criticism of the gap between an elite group of &quot;super clubs&quot; and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs. Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the &quot;Big Four&quot; to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season. That season also saw two of the &quot;Big Four&quot; (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.

With only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the five seasons following the 2011–12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times, whilst Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17, ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.

In the 2015–16 season, underdogs Leicester City won the Premier League. With 5000/1 odds of winning the league at the beginning of the season, Leicester became the first club outside the &quot;Big Six&quot; to win the Premier League since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season.

Off the pitch, the &quot;Big Six&quot; wield significant financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play. Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success. The 2016–17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between the &quot;Big Six&quot; and the rest of the division. All of the &quot;Big Six&quot; had revenues greater than €350 million, with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at €676.3 million. Leicester City was the closest club to the &quot;Big Six&quot; in terms of revenue, recording a figure of €271.1 million for that season – helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth-largest revenue generator, West Ham – who did not play in European competition – had revenues of €213.3 million, less than half of those of the club with the fifth-largest revenue, Liverpool (€424.2 million). A substantial part of the clubs&#x27; revenue by then came from television broadcast deals, with the biggest clubs each taking from around £150 million to nearly £200 million in the 2016–17 season from such deals. In Deloitte&#x27;s 2019 report, all the &quot;Big Six&quot; were in the top ten of the world&#x27;s richest clubs.

===Manchester City dominance (2020s)===
From the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league. The 2019–20 season saw Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years.

Project Big Picture was announced in October 2020 that described a plan to reunite the top Premier League clubs with the English Football League, proposed by leading Premier League clubs Manchester United and Liverpool. It has been criticised by the Premier League leadership and the UK government&#x27;s Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

On 26 April 2021, play was stopped during a match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace to allow Muslim players Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyaté to break Ramadan fast. It is believed to be the first time in Premier League history that a game was paused to allow Muslim players to eat and drink after the sun had set in accordance with the rules of the faith.

The 2022–23 season was the first to take a six-week break between November and December 2022 to allow for the first winter World Cup, with a return for the Boxing Day fixtures. The Premier League players decided to take the knee at selected &quot;significant moments&quot;. They assured to &quot;remain resolutely committed to eradicate racial prejudice&quot;. That season was notable for Newcastle United and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion breaking the traditional &quot;Big Six&quot; as they finished fourth and sixth, respectively, whilst &quot;Big Six&quot; teams Tottenham and Chelsea finished eighth and twelfth. Meanwhile, 2015–16 champions Leicester City were relegated, becoming the second league-winning club to suffer relegation since 1992, after Blackburn Rovers in the 2011–12 season.

In the 2023–24 season, Manchester City won the Premier League for the sixth time in seven years to become the first top-flight team to win four consecutive league titles in English football history. Meanwhile, non-Big Six club Aston Villa finished fourth and qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League.


==Corporate structure==
The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL) is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs select a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league. The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.

The current chief executive is Richard Masters, who was appointed in December 2019. The chair is currently Alison Brittain, who took over the role in early 2023.

The Premier League sends representatives to UEFA&#x27;s European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2023–24 season, the Premier League has 13 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United, and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA&#x27;s Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.

===Criticism of governance ===
The Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability.

Following the Premier League&#x27;s blocking of the attempted takeover of Newcastle United by a PIF-backed consortium through the league&#x27;s Owners&#x27; and Directors&#x27; test, many MPs, Newcastle United fans and related parties to the deal denounced the Premier League for its perceived lack of transparency and accountability throughout the process. On 6 July 2021, consortium member Amanda Staveley of PCP Capital Partners said that &quot;fans surely deserve absolute transparency from the regulators across all their processes – to best ensure that they act responsibly. They (the Premier League) are performing a function like that of a government regulator – but without the same systems for accountability.&quot;

On 22 July 2021, Tracey Crouch MP – chair of the fan-led review into the UK&#x27;s football governance – announced in the review&#x27;s interim findings that the Premier League had &quot;lost the trust and confidence&quot; of fans. The review also recommended that a new independent regulator be created to oversee matters such as club takeovers.

Premier League chief executive Richard Masters had earlier spoken out against the implementation of an independent regulator, saying in May 2021, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that the independent regulator is the answer to the question. I would defend the Premier League&#x27;s role as regulator of its clubs over the past 30 years.&quot;

==Competition format==


===Competition===
There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.

===Promotion and relegation===
A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League, with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs. The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted. The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.

On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy&#x27;s Serie A and Spain&#x27;s La Liga, be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction. Ultimately, the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.

===Video Assistant Referee===
Video assistant referee (VAR), was introduced to the Premier League at the beginning of the 2019–20 season. It uses technology and officials to assist the referee in making decisions on the pitch. However, its use has been met with mixed receptions from fans and pundits, with some praising its accuracy whilst others criticise its impact on the flow of the game and consistency of decision-making.

The on-field referee still makes the final decision, but VAR can assist the referee in the decision-making process. VAR can only be used for four types of decisions: goals, penalty decisions, direct red card incidents, and cases of mistaken identity. VAR officials review the video footage and communicate with the on-field referee via a headset. The VAR officials are located in a central control room, which is equipped with multiple camera angles and the ability to replay footage at various speeds.

A study evaluating fan reception of VAR in the Premier League was made by Otto Kolbinger and Melanie Knopp and was done by analysing Twitter data. The researchers used sentiment analysis to measure the overall positive or negative attitudes towards VAR, as well as topic modelling to identify specific issues that fans are discussing related to VAR. The study found that the reception of VAR on Twitter is largely negative, with fans expressing frustration and criticism of the technology&#x27;s impact on the flow of the game and the inconsistency of decisions. The researchers also identified specific issues, such as handball and offside decisions, that fans are particularly critical of. The study concludes that VAR has not been well received by fans in the Premier League, and that efforts to improve the technology and increase transparency in decision-making are needed to address these concerns.

==Clubs==
Fifty-one clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2023–24 season.

===Champions===

&quot;Italics&quot; indicate former Premier League champions that are currently outside the Premier League.

===2024–25 season===
Twenty clubs are competing in the 2024–25 season – top seventeen from the previous season and three promoted from the Championship.

*Luton Town, Burnley and Sheffield United were relegated to the EFL Championship for the 2024–25 season, whilst Leicester City, Ipswich Town, and Southampton, as winners, runners-up and play-off final winners, respectively, were promoted from the 2023–24 season.
*Only two clubs have remained in the Premier League since their first promotion: Brentford and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, who have been in 4 and 8 season(s) (out of 33), respectively.


===Non-English clubs===
In 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time. The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City&#x27;s home match at Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011. The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14, as Cardiff City gained promotion, but they were relegated after their maiden season. Cardiff were promoted again in 2017–18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018–19 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017–18. Following Cardiff City&#x27;s relegation after the 2018–19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League.

Because they are members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England&#x27;s three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–13. The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.

Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result. The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland. Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland&#x27;s two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.

==International competitions==

===Qualification for European competitions===
====Qualification criteria for 2024–25====
The top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season&#x27;s UEFA Champions League league phase. The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season&#x27;s Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League. However, starting from the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League there are additional berths for the two best associations in the previous season&#x27;s ranking, which may result in a maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League.

The fifth-placed team in the Premier League, as well as the winners of the FA Cup, qualify for the subsequent season&#x27;s Europa League league phase, but if the winner of the FA Cup also finishes in the top five places in the Premier League or has won one of UEFA&#x27;s major tournaments, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth. The winner of the EFL Cup qualifies for the subsequent season&#x27;s UEFA Conference League, but if the winner had already qualified for a UEFA competition via their performance in another competition, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League, or seventh if the FA Cup result had already caused the sixth-placed team to qualify.

The number of places allocated to English clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position the country holds in the UEFA coefficient rankings, which are calculated based on the performance of teams in UEFA competitions over the previous five years. Currently, England is ranked first, ahead of Spain.

As of 26 September 2024, the coefficients for are as follows (only top five European leagues are shown):


====Previous seasons====
An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the season before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. The governing body subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winners finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League. This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the 2012–13 Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.

From 2015–16, the Europa League champions qualify for the Champions League, increasing the maximum number of participants per country to five. This took effect in England in 2016–17, when Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League and won the Europa League, giving England five Champions League entrants for 2017–18. In these instances, any Europa League berth vacated is not handed down to the next-best Premier League finisher outside of a qualifying place. If both Champions League and Europa League winners are of the same association and both finish outside the top four, then the fourth-placed team is transferred to the Europa League.

===Performance in international competition===

With 48 continental trophies won, English clubs are the third-most successful in European football, behind Italy (50) and Spain (67). In the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 20 and 11, respectively. In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are third, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals. In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, English teams won a record eight titles and had a further five finalists. In the non-UEFA organised Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively. In the newly created third-tier UEFA Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far. In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings, although English clubs were notorious for treating the tournament with disdain, either sending &quot;B&quot; squads or withdrawing from it altogether. In the one-off UEFA Super Cup, England has ten winners and ten runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with 17 and 15, respectively. Similarly to the Intertoto Cup, English teams did not take the former Intercontinental Cup seriously enough, despite its international status of the &quot;Club World Championship&quot;. They a made a total of six appearances in the one-off competition, winning only one of them, and withdrew a further three times. English clubs have won the FIFA-organised Club World Cup four times, tied for the second-most with Brazil, and behind only Spain, with eight.

==Sponsorship==

After an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the Premier League was sponsored by Carling from 1993 until 2001, during which time it was known as the FA Carling Premiership. In 2001, a new sponsorship deal with Barclaycard saw the league rebranded the FA Barclaycard Premiership, which was changed to the FA Barclays Premiership in time for the 2004–05 season.

For the 2007–08 season, the league was rebranded the Barclays Premier League.

Barclays&#x27; deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. The organisation announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a &quot;clean&quot; brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues.

As well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers. The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000–01 season when they took over from Mitre. Under its &quot;Merlin&quot; brand, Topps held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League between 1994 and 2019 including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards. Launched in the 2007–08 season, Topps&#x27; Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world. In October 2018, Panini were awarded the licence to produce collectables from the 2019–20 season. The chocolate company Cadbury has been the official snack partner of the Premier League since 2017, and sponsored the Golden Boot, Golden Glove and Playmaker of the Season awards from the 2017–18 season to 2019–20 season. The Coca-Cola Company (under its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar product line) sponsored these awards during the 2020–21 season with Castrol being the current sponsor as of the 2021–22 season.

==Finances==

The Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10. In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues. In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom&#x27;s broadcasting industry.

The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world. Deloitte&#x27;s &quot;Football Money League&quot; listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009–10 season, and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013–14 season, largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue. In 2019, the league generated around £3.1 billion per year in domestic and international television rights.

Premier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.

Central payments for the 2016–17 season amounted to £2,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of £35,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (£1,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, £1,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and £39,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of £4,759,404) and a notional measure of &quot;merit&quot; which was based upon final league position. The merit component was a nominal sum of £1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 × £1,941,609 = £9,708,045 merit payment).

===Relegation===

Since its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues. Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this.

Promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first Premier League season. One Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League every season, save the 2001–02, 2011–12, 2017–18 &amp; 2022–23 seasons. In the 1997–98 and 2023–24 seasons, all three promoted clubs were relegated by the season&#x27;s end.

The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue as &quot;parachute payments&quot; to relegated clubs for adjustment to television revenue loss. The average Premier League team receives £41 million whilst the average Championship club receives £2 million. Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons. Critics maintain that the payments widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not, leading to the common occurrence of teams &quot;bouncing back&quot; soon after their relegation.

Clubs which have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League have seen financial problems, in some cases administration or liquidation. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have occurred for multiple clubs unable to cope with the gap.

==Media coverage==
===United Kingdom and Ireland===

Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League&#x27;s decision to assign broadcasting rights to Sky in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time, paid television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky&#x27;s strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public&#x27;s appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League&#x27;s TV rights soar.

The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs. The money is divided into three parts: half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.

Not all Premier League matches are televised in the United Kingdom, as the league upholds the long-standing prohibition on telecasts of any association football match (domestic or otherwise) that kicks off between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays.

The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons. The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons. The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2004. The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2007. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis. Sky&#x27;s monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid £1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on &quot;Match of the Day&quot;) for £171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period. Sky and BT Group (via its new channel BT Sport, now TNT Sports) agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 p.m. on matchday. Overseas television rights fetched £625 million, nearly double the previous contract. The total raised from those deals was more than £2.7 billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.

The TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases arose as a result. An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position. In July 1999 the Premier League&#x27;s method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, which concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.

The BBC&#x27;s highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights, as well as other evenings when fixtures justify, ran until 2016. Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 were purchased for £1.782 billion. On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30 million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2013. On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons at £246 million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky, which paid £760 million-a-year. The total domestic rights raised £3.018 billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights. The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid £5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season.

A new rights cycle began in the 2019–20 season, with the domestic package increasing to 200 matches overall; in February 2018, BT were awarded the package of 32 lunchtime fixtures on Saturdays, whilst Sky was awarded four of the seven packages, covering the majority of weekend fixtures (including eight new prime time fixtures on Saturdays), as well as Monday and Friday matches. Two remaining packages of 20 fixtures each were to be sold at a later date, including three rounds of mid-week fixtures and a bank holiday round. As Sky already owned the maximum number of matches it could hold without breaching a 148-match cap, it was speculated that at least one of the new packages could go to a new entrant, such as a streaming service. The five packages sold to BT and Sky were valued at £4.464 billion. In June 2018, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video and BT had acquired the remaining two packages; Amazon acquired rights to 20 matches per-season, covering a mid-week round in December, and all Boxing Day fixtures. The Amazon telecasts are produced in association with Sunset + Vine and BT Sport.

With the resumption of play in the 2019–20 Premier League due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Premier League announced that all remaining matches would be carried on British television, split primarily across Sky, BT, and Amazon. A large number of these matches were also scheduled for free-to-air broadcasts, with Sky airing 25 on Pick, Amazon streaming its four matches on Twitch, and the BBC – for the first time in league history – carrying four live matches.

As matches would continue to be played without spectators upon the start of the 2020–21 Premier League, its clubs voted on 8 September to continue broadcasting all matches through at least September (with the BBC and Amazon each holding one additional match), and &quot;appropriate arrangements&quot; being made for October. It was later announced that matches not selected for broadcast would be carried on pay-per-view via BT Sport Box Office and Sky Box Office at a cost of £14.95 per-match. The PPV scheme was poorly received; the Football Supporters&#x27; Federation felt that the price was too high, and there were concerns that it could encourage piracy. There were calls from supporters to boycott the pay-per-views, and make donations to support charitable causes instead (with Newcastle&#x27;s &quot;Charity Not PPV&quot; campaign raising £20,000 for a local food bank, and Arsenal fans raising £34,000 for Islington Giving). On 13 November, amid the reintroduction of measures across the UK, the Premier League officially announced that the non-televised matches would be assigned to its main broadcast partners, and again including additional matches for the BBC and Amazon Prime.

The next cycle of rights between 2022–23 and 2024–25 season was renewed without tender due to compelling and exceptional circumstances in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, rights remained as they were since the 2019–20 season.

UK highlights

In August 2016, it was announced the BBC would be creating a new magazine-style show for the Premier League entitled &quot;The Premier League Show&quot;.

===Worldwide===

The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. The Premier League&#x27;s production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces content for its international television partners. On 22 November 2024, the Premier League announced plans to end its agreement with IMG and take Premier League Productions in-house beginning in 2026–27.

The Premier League is the most widely distributed sports programme in Asia. In the Indian subcontinent, the matches are broadcast live on STAR Sports. In MENA region, BeIN Sports holds exclusive rights to the Premier League. In China, the broadcast rights were awarded to iQiyi, Migu and CCTV that began in the 2021–22 season. SCTV broadcast the matches for Indonesia, and Astro for Malaysia. In Australia, Optus telecommunications holds exclusive rights to the Premier League, providing live broadcasts and online access (Fox Sports formerly held rights). As of the 2022–23 season, Canadian media rights to the Premier League are owned by FuboTV, after having been jointly owned by Sportsnet and TSN, and most recently DAZN.

The Premier League is broadcast in the United States by NBC Sports, a division of Sky parent Comcast. Acquiring the rights to the Premier League in 2013 (replacing Fox Soccer and ESPN), NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage. NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league until the end of the 2021–22 season in a deal valued at $1 billion (£640 million). In November 2021, NBC reached another six-year extension through 2028 in a deal valued at $2.76 billion (£2 billion).

The Premier League is broadcast by SuperSport across sub-Saharan Africa. Broadcasters to continental Europe until 2025 include Canal+ for France, Sky Sport Germany for Germany and Austria, Match TV for Russia, Sky Sport Italy for Italy, Eleven Sports for Portugal, DAZN for Spain, beIN Sports Turkey to Turkey, Digi Sport for Romania, and NENT to Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark and Norway), Poland and the Netherlands. In South America, ESPN covers much of the continent, with coverage in Brazil shared between ESPN Brasil and ESPN4. Paramount+ broadcasts the league in Central America.

==Stadiums==
As of the 2023–24 season, Premier League football has been played in 61 stadiums since the formation of the division. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished. As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater. Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums. Eleven stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2023–24 season show a large disparity in capacity. For example, Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, has a capacity of 74,031 whilst Dean Court, the home of Bournemouth, has a capacity of 11,307. The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2023–24 season is 787,002 with an average capacity of 39,350.

Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs. For the 2022–23 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 40,235 for Premier League matches with an aggregate attendance of 15,289,340.&lt;ref name=&quot;2022/23 Attendance&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This represents an increase of 19,109 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the Premier League&#x27;s first season (1992–93). However, during the 1992–93 season, the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report&#x27;s 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums. The 2022–23 season also set a competition record for total attendance with more than 15 million spectators, with average attendance also reaching record levels, surpassing the previous record of 39,989 set in the 2021–22 season, which in turn broke an over 70-year-old record set in the 1948–49 season.

In October 2024 it was reported that the government is planning to grant the independent regulator authority to stop Premier League clubs from selling their stadiums to affiliated or third-party companies.

==Managers==
Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans. Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;A&#x27; Licences. The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (&quot;i.e.&quot;, more than 12 weeks, the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control). Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including Paul Hart at Portsmouth, David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur and Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Manchester United.

Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his departure at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League&#x27;s inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.

Notably, since its creation the Premier League has never been won by an English manager.

There have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam, performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater&#x27;s study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.


==Players==
===Appearances===


===Transfer regulations and foreign players===
Player transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis. As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances. This was to enable the &quot;home grown&quot; rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be &quot;home-grown players&quot;.

At the inception of the Premier League in 1992–93, just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland. By 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36% of the total. In the 2004–05 season, the figure had increased to 45%. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up, and on 14 February 2005, Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match. By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English. By February 2020, 117 different nationalities had played in the Premier League, and 101 nationalities had scored in the competition.

In 1999, in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union. A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive &#x27;A&#x27; team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.

Following the implementation of Brexit in January 2021, new regulations were introduced which require all foreign players to obtain a Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) in order to play football in the United Kingdom, regardless of EU status.

===Top scorers===



The Premier League Golden Boot is awarded each season to the top scorer in the division. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260. Thirty-three players have reached the 100-goal mark. Since the first Premier League season in 1992–93, 23 players from 11 clubs have won or shared the top scorer title. Thierry Henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005–06 season. Erling Haaland holds the record for most goals in a Premier League season (38 matches) with 36 goals as of 15 May 2023. Ryan Giggs of Manchester United holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons, having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league. Giggs also holds the record for the most Premier League assists, with 162.

===Wages===
There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was £75,000 per year. In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £2.99 million.

The total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018–19 season was £1.62 billion; this compares to £1.05 billion in La Liga, £0.83 billion in Serie A, £0.72 billion in Bundesliga, and £0.54 billion in Ligue 1. The club with the highest average wage is Manchester United at £6.5 million. This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain (Barcelona £10.5 million) and Italy (Juventus £6.7 million), but higher than in Germany (Bayern Munich £6.4 million) and France (Paris Saint-Germain £6.1 million). For the 2018–19 season, the ratio of the wages of the highest-paid team to lowest-paid in the Premier League is 6.82 to 1. This is much lower than in La Liga (19.1 to 1), Serie A (16 to 1), Bundesliga (20.5 to 1), and Ligue 1 (26.6 to 1). Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League, it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues.

===Player transfer fees===
The record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million. The record has increased steadily and Enzo Fernández is now the most expensive transfer fee paid by a Premier League club at £106.8 million, whilst Philippe Coutinho is the biggest transfer involving a Premier League club at £105 million.



==Awards==

===Trophy===
The Premier League maintains two trophies – the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica. Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being secured, in the event that on the final day of the season two clubs are still within reach of winning the League. In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season, a replica won by a previous club is used.

The current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Garrard &amp; Co/Asprey of London and was designed in house at Garrard &amp; Co by Trevor Brown and Paul Marsden. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base. The plinth weighs and the trophy weighs . The trophy and plinth are tall, wide and deep.

Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, whilst its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. The green of the malachite represents the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season. The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year. In 2004, a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat.

===Player and manager awards===
In addition to the winner&#x27;s trophy and the individual winner&#x27;s medals awarded to players who win the title, the Premier League also issues other awards throughout the season.

A man-of-the-match award is awarded to the player who has the greatest impact in an individual match.

Monthly awards are also given for the Manager of the Month, Player of the Month and Goal of the Month. These are also issued annually for Manager of the Season, Player of the Season and Goal of the Season. The Young Player of the Season award is given to the most outstanding U-23 player starting from the 2019–20 season.

The Golden Boot award is given to the top goalscorer of every season, the Playmaker of the Season award is given to the player who makes the most assists of every season, and the Golden Glove award is given to the goalkeeper with the most clean sheets at the end of the season.

Starting with the 2021–22 season, four new awards are given. The Save of the Season is awarded to the goalkeeper deemed to have made the most impressive save. The Game Changer of the Season is earned by the player with the single most game-changing performance over the course of the campaign. The Most Powerful Goal is given to the player whose goal-scoring shot had the highest average velocity from the time it was struck to the time it crossed the goal line, and the Most Improbable Comeback award is meant for the team that, based on calculations performed by Oracle Corporation, goes behind and overcomes a deficit to win their respective match.

From the 2017–18 season, players receive a milestone award for 100 appearances and every century there after and also players who score 50 goals and multiples thereof. Each player to reach these milestones is to receive a presentation box from the Premier League containing a special medallion and a plaque commemorating their achievement.

<doc id="11252" wikidata="Q247135" url="?curid=11252" title="Fine Gael">
<text>Fine Gael ( ; ; ) is a centre-right, liberal-conservative, Christian democratic political party in Ireland. Fine Gael is currently the third-largest party in the Republic of Ireland in terms of members of Dáil Éireann. The party had a membership of 25,000 in 2021. Simon Harris succeeded Leo Varadkar as party leader on 24 March 2024.

Fine Gael was founded on 8 September 1933, following the merger of its parent party Cumann na nGaedheal, the National Centre Party and the Blueshirts. Its origins lie in the struggle for Irish independence and the pro-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War, with the party claiming the legacy of Michael Collins. In its early years, the party was commonly known as &quot;Fine Gael – The United Ireland Party&quot;, abbreviated &quot;UIP&quot;, and its official title in its constitution remains Fine Gael (United Ireland).

Fine Gael holds a pro-European stance and is generally considered to be more of a proponent of economic liberalism than its traditional rival, Fianna Fáil. Fine Gael describes itself as a &quot;party of the progressive centre&quot; which it defines as acting &quot;in a way that is right for Ireland, regardless of dogma or ideology&quot;. It lists its core values as &quot;equality of opportunity, free enterprise and reward, security, integrity and hope.&quot; In international politics, the party is highly supportive of the European Union, along with generally supporting strengthened relations with the United Kingdom and opposition to physical force Irish republicanism. The party&#x27;s autonomous youth wing, Young Fine Gael (YFG), was formed in 1977.

Having governed in coalition with the Labour Party between 2011 and 2016, and in a minority government along with Independent TDs from 2016 to 2020, Fine Gael currently forms part of a historic coalition government with its traditional rival, Fianna Fáil, and the Green Party, with Simon Harris serving as Taoiseach since April 2024.

==History==
===Foundation===

Fine Gael was created in 1933 following the merger of three political organisations; Cumann na nGaedhael (CnaG) led by W. T. Cosgrave, the National Centre Party led by Frank MacDermot and James Dillon, and the National Guard (better known as the Blueshirts), led by Eoin O&#x27;Duffy. Cumann na nGaedhael, born out of the pro-Anglo-Irish Treaty side in the Irish Civil War, had been the party of government from the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 until the 1932 general election, which it lost to the newly emergent Fianna Fáil. The National Centre Party was a new party that had done well at the 1932 election, and represented the interests of farmers. The National Guard were not a political party, but a militant group made up of former pro-Treaty Irish Army soldiers, and was previously known as the Army Comrades Association. Following the disruption of Cumann na nGaedhael meetings by members of the Irish Republican Army, the ACA had begun providing security at their events. This led to the leadership of the ACA being taken over by a number of CnaG TDs, including Thomas F. O&#x27;Higgins. In early 1933, Eoin O&#x27;Duffy took over the ACA, renamed them the National Guard, and began instilling the organisation with elements of European fascism. However, in August 1933 the Fianna Fáil government banned the National Guard, fearing a planned parade in Dublin might be an attempt to emulate the March on Rome, which saw Benito Mussolini rise to power in Italy.

In September 1933, the three groups combined forces and merged to form Fine Gael. The National Guard (referred to informally by this point as &quot;the Blueshirts&quot;) were to serve as the youth wing of the new party, &quot;The League of Youth&quot;. CnaG members dominated the new party. However, to avoid the perception that Fine Gael was simply Cumann na nGaedhael under a new name, O&#x27;Duffy was made leader of the new party. Following poor results at the 1934 local elections and concerns over his increasingly rabid rhetoric, O&#x27;Duffy resigned from the leadership after the party attempted to control what he said in public. He was replaced by W. T. Cosgrave, with James Dillon becoming deputy leader. O&#x27;Duffy attempted to regain control of the Blueshirts, but was rebuffed by the majority of them, who chose to stay with Fine Gael. Under the stewardship of Cosgrave and Dillon, the party returned to the more traditional conservatism espoused by Cumann na nGaedhael, with the moribund League of Youth disbanded by 1936.

===Finding success with coalitions with Labour===

Fine Gael remained out of government and at a low ebb for a prolonged period until the aftermath of the 1948 general election, which saw the party form a grand coalition with several other parties in order to oust Fianna Fáil and place Fine Gael member John A. Costello as Taoiseach. The coalition was short-lived but revived again between 1954 and 1957. However, following this stint Fine Gael returned to opposition for 16 years. The party went through a period of soul-searching during the 1960s, in which a new generation of Fine Gael politicians led by Declan Costello sought to revitalise Fine Gael with new ideas. In what has later been hailed as a landmark moment in Fine Gael history, Costello proposed moving the party to the left in a social democratic direction with a document entitled &quot;Towards a Just Society&quot;. The document was adopted as the basis for the party&#x27;s manifesto for the 1965 general election; however, when the party failed to make headway at the polls the momentum behind the Just Society document wilted and faded.

It was not until leader Liam Cosgrave secured an election pact with the Labour Party that Fine Gael returned to government in 1973. This period also saw Fine Gael becoming increasingly liberal in ethos, particularly under the leadership of Garret FitzGerald who took the reins of the party in 1977; It was during this time that Fine Gael campaigned in a number of referendums: the party supported Irish entry into the European Economic Community, supported lowering the voting age from 21 to 18, and supported a proposal to remove the &quot;special position&quot; of the Roman Catholic Church from the constitution. It was on the successful side in all three of these campaigns. The party also began to take a more liberal approach to the introduction of contraceptives to Ireland, although an attempt by the Fine Gael/Labour coalition to legalise contraceptives in 1974 stumbled after six members of Fine Gael, most prominently Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave, voted against the government&#x27;s own bill.

The arrangement between Fine Gael and Labour proved pleasing to both parties and their election pacts remained throughout the rest of the 1970s and into the 1980s, seeing the pair enter government a number of times together. In 1985, Fine Gael/Labour voted to liberalise access to contraceptives. That same year FitzGerald signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement with Margaret Thatcher, paving the way to devolved government in Northern Ireland. In 1986 the party campaigned for a Yes in that year&#x27;s referendum on legalising divorce, which was defeated, with the No side obtaining 63.5% of the vote.

===Decline and rebuilding===
The 1980s had proven fruitful electorally for Fine Gael, but the 1990s and early 2000s saw this momentum decline quickly. One of the first signs of this was the party&#x27;s poor result in the 1990 presidential election, in which their candidate Austin Currie obtained just 17% of the first preference vote.

Fine Gael formed a government between 1994 and 1997 with the Labour Party and the Democratic Left. This government legalised divorce after a successful referendum in 1995. The party&#x27;s share of TDs fell from 54 in 1997 to only 31 in the 2002 general election, its second-worst result ever at that point. It was at this point Enda Kenny took over leadership of the party and began the process of rebuilding it. At the 2007 general election Kenny was able to bring Fine Gael back to its 1997 levels with 51 TDs.

===Recovery===
The collapse of the Celtic Tiger resulted in the post-2008 Irish economic downturn, which threw Ireland not only into economic turmoil but also political upheaval. The 2011 Irish general election saw the governing Fianna Fáil collapse at the polls, while Fine Gael and the Labour Party returned with their best results ever. For the first time in its history, Fine Gael became the largest party in Dáil Eireann. Once more Fine Gael and Labour paired up to form a government, their tenure marked by the difficulty of trying to guide Ireland towards economic recovery. In 2013, a number of Fine Gael parliamentary party members, including Lucinda Creighton, were expelled from the party for defying the party whip on anti-abortion grounds to oppose the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill. These members subsequently formed a political party called Renua.

===Since 2015===
In 2015, the Fine Gael/Labour government held a referendum to allow gay marriage under the constitution. The government campaigned for a yes vote and were successful. Following the 2016 general election, Fine Gael retained control of the government as a minority government, made possible by a confidence and supply agreement with Fianna Fáíl, who agreed to abstain in confidence votes. Enda Kenny resigned as party leader in 2017. Following a leadership contest, Leo Varadkar became his successor as well as Taoiseach. In doing so, Varadkar became one of the first openly LGBT heads of government in the world. In 2018 the Fine Gael government held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment, the provision in the Irish constitution which forbid abortion. The party campaigned to repeal the amendment and was successful.

After the 2020 general election, for the first time in history, Fine Gael entered into a coalition government with its traditional rival Fianna Fáil, as well as the Green Party, with Leo Varadkar serving as Tánaiste for the first half of the government&#x27;s five-year term, then becoming Taoiseach in December 2022. Leo Varadkar resigned as leader of Fine Gael on 20 March 2024, and was succeeded by Simon Harris, who was elected unopposed on 24 March.

==Ideology and policies==

As a political party of the centre-right, Fine Gael has been described as liberal-conservative, Christian-democratic, liberal, conservative liberal, conservative, and pro-European, with an ideological base combining elements of cultural conservatism and economic liberalism.

Although Ireland&#x27;s political spectrum was traditionally divided along Civil War lines, rather than the traditional European left–right spectrum, Fine Gael is described generally as a centre-right party, with a focus on &quot;fiscal rectitude&quot;. As the descendant of the pro-Treaty factions in the Irish Civil War, Fine Gael cites Michael Collins as an inspiration and claims his legacy. He remains a symbol for the party, and the anniversary of his death is commemorated each year in August.

Although Fine Gael was historically a Catholic party, it became the de facto home for Irish Protestants. Its membership base had a higher proportion of Protestants than that of Fianna Fáil or Labour. The party promoted a strong Catholic image and depicted itself as a defender of Catholicism against Atheistic Communism, of which it accused the two aforementioned parties of being sympathetic to.
===Social policies===
Fine Gael adopted the &quot;Just Society&quot; policy statement in the 1960s, based on principles of social justice and equality. It was created by the emerging social democratic wing of the party, led by Declan Costello. The ideas expressed in the policy statement had a significant influence on the party in the years to come.

While Fine Gael was traditionally socially conservative for most of the twentieth century due to the conservative Christian ethos of Irish society during this time, its members are variously influenced by social liberalism, social democracy and Christian democracy on issues of social policy. Under Garret FitzGerald, the party&#x27;s more socially liberal, or pluralist, wing gained prominence. Proposals to allow divorce were put to referendum by two Fine Gael–led governments, in 1986 under FitzGerald, and in 1995 under John Bruton, passing very narrowly on this second attempt. Its modern supporters have shown a preference for postmaterialist values.

====LGBT+ issues====

Fine Gael supported civil unions for same-sex couples from 2003, voting for the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2010. In 2012, the party approved a motion at its Ardfheis to prioritise the consideration of same-sex marriage in the upcoming constitutional convention. In 2013, party leader and Taoiseach Enda Kenny declared his support for same-sex marriage. The Fine Gael–led government held a referendum on the subject on 22 May 2015. The referendum passed, with the electorate voting to extend full marriage rights to same-sex couples, with 62.1% in favour and 37.9% opposed.

In 2015, months before the marriage equality referendum, Leo Varadkar became the first Irish government minister to come out as gay. In May 2019, former Rose of Tralee Maria Walsh, was elected as a Fine Gael MEP for the Midlands-Northwest constituency in the 2019 European Parliament election, running alongside Mairéad McGuinness MEP. Walsh was Fine Gael&#x27;s first openly lesbian candidate.

Fine Gael has an LGBT+ section, Fine Gael LGBT, and in 2017, Leo Varadkar became the first Taoiseach to march in Dublin Pride.

==== Abortion ====
In 1983, the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which proposed to protect the life of the unborn, was put to a referendum. Fine Gael initially supported the proposal, but then came out in opposition to it. Under leader and Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, the party campaigned for a &#x27;No&#x27; vote, arguing, on the advice of the Attorney General Peter Sutherland, that the wording, which had been drafted under the previous government, was ambiguous and open to many interpretations. Its stance conflicted with that of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign (PLAC) and Catholic bishops, and Fianna Fáil, the largest party in the State at the time, but then in opposition. The amendment resulted in the addition of Article 40.3.3° to the Constitution, giving the unborn child a qualified equal right to life to that of the mother.

In 1992, in the X Case, the Supreme Court held that a risk to the life of woman from suicide was a permissible ground under Article 40.3.3° for abortion. In 2002, Fine Gael campaigned against the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which proposed to remove suicide as a grounds for granting a termination of a pregnancy. The amendment was rejected by Irish voters.

In 2013 it proposed, and supported, the enactment of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, which implemented in statute law the &quot;X case&quot; ruling of the Supreme Court, granting access to a termination of a pregnancy where there is a real and substantial risk to the life, not the health, of the mother, including a threat of suicide. Five TDs and two Senators, including Minister of State Lucinda Creighton, lost the Fine Gael party whip for voting against the legislation. Creighton later left Fine Gael to found Renua. The Act was criticised by various anti-abortion groups and Catholic bishops, but supported by a majority of the electorate in opinion polls, with many indicating they wished to see a more liberal law on abortion.

Enda Kenny&#x27;s Fine Gael–led minority government took office after the 2016 election with a programme which promised a randomly selected Citizens&#x27; Assembly to report on possible changes to the Eighth Amendment, which would be considered by an Oireachtas committee, to whose report the government would respond officially in debates in both houses of the Oireachtas. Fine Gael Oireachtas members were promised a free vote on the issue. Leo Varadkar succeeded Enda Kenny as Taoiseach on 14 June 2017 and promised to hold a referendum on abortion in 2018. Several Fine Gael TDs, notably Health Minister Simon Harris and Kate O&#x27;Connell, were prominent supporters of the pro-choice side before and during the referendum. While the party was divided, the majority of Fine Gael TDs and Senators, as well as most members, were in favour of repealing the Eighth Amendment. A referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment was held on 25 May 2018 and was approved by 66.4% of voters.

==== Drug policies ====
The party has traditionally held a strong stance against the decriminalisation of drugs. In 2007, Fine Gael&#x27;s leader at the time Enda Kenny called for drug and alcohol testing to be performed in schools, saying cocaine usage at schools was &quot;rampant&quot; in some areas.

At the party&#x27;s 2014 Ard Fheis, a proposed motion to support the legalisation of cannabis was voted down by the membership.

In 2016, the Fine Gael health minister James Reilly said that they would not be changing their policy on the legalisation of cannabis, due to &quot;serious concerns about the health impacts&quot; of cannabis.

===Economic policies===
Fine Gael has, since its inception, portrayed itself as a party of fiscal rectitude and minimal government interference in economics, advocating pro-enterprise policies. In that they followed the line of the previous pro-Treaty government that believed in minimal state intervention, low taxes and social expenditures. Newly elected politicians for the party in the Dáil have strongly advocated liberal economic policies. Lucinda Creighton (who has since left the party) and Leo Varadkar in particular have been seen as strong advocates of a neoliberal approach to Ireland&#x27;s economic woes and unemployment problems. Varadkar in particular has been a strong proponent of small, indigenous business, advocating in 2008 that smaller firms should have benefitted from the government&#x27;s recapitalisation program. Its former finance spokesman Richard Bruton&#x27;s proposals were seen as approaching problems from a pro-enterprise point of view. Its fairer budget website in 2011 suggested that its solutions are &quot;tough but fair&quot;. Other solutions conform generally to conservative governments&#x27; policies throughout Europe, focusing on cutting numbers in the public sector, while maintaining investment in infrastructure.

Fine Gael&#x27;s proposals have sometimes been criticised mostly by smaller political groupings in Ireland, and by some of the trade unions, who have raised the idea that the party&#x27;s solutions are more conscious of business interests than the interests of the worker. In 2008 the SIPTU trade union stated its opposition to then-Taoiseach Enda Kenny&#x27;s assertion, in response to Ireland&#x27;s economic crisis, that the national wage agreement ought to have been suspended. Kenny&#x27;s comments had support however and the party attributed its significant rise in polls in 2008 to this.

Fine Gael&#x27;s Simon Coveney launched what the party termed a radical re-organisation of the Irish semi-state company sector. Styled the New Economy and Recovery Authority (or NewERA), Coveney said that it is an economic stimulus plan that will &quot;reshape the Irish economy for the challenges of the 21st century&quot;. Requiring an €18.2 billion investment in Energy, Communications and Water infrastructure over a four-year period, it was promoted as a way to enhance energy security and the digital reputation of Ireland. A very broad-ranging document, it proposed the combined management of a portfolio of semi-state assets, and the sale of all other, non-essential services. The release of equity through the sale of the various state resources, including electricity generation services belonging to the ESB, Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis, in combination with use of money in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, was Fine Gael&#x27;s proposed funding source for its national stimulus package.

The plan was seen as the longer term contribution to Fine Gael&#x27;s economic agenda and the basis of its program for government. It was publicised in combination with a more short term policy proposal from Leo Varadkar. This document, termed &quot;Hope for a Lost Generation&quot;, promised to bring 30,000 young Irish people off the Live Register in a year by combining a National Internship Program, a Second Chance Education Scheme, an Apprenticeship Guarantee and Community Work Program, as well as instituting a German style Workshare program.

===Constitutional reform policies===
In 2010 Fine Gael&#x27;s Phil Hogan published the party&#x27;s proposals for political and constitutional reform. In a policy document entitled &quot;New Politics&quot;, Hogan suggested creating a country with &quot;a smaller, more dynamic and more responsive political system&quot; by reducing the size of the Dáil by 20, changing the way the Dáil works, and by abolishing the Irish senate, Seanad Éireann.

The question of whether to abolish the Seanad or not was put to a referendum in 2013, with voters voting 51% to 49% to retain bicameralism in Ireland.

===Health policies===
The Irish health system, being administered centrally by the Health Service Executive, is seen to be poor by comparison to other countries in Europe, ranking outside expected levels at 25th according to the Euro Health Consumer Index 2006.

Fine Gael has long wanted Ireland to break with the system of private health insurance, public medical cards and what it calls the two tiers of the health system and has launched a campaign to see the system reformed. Speaking in favour of the campaign, Fine Gael then health spokesman James Reilly stated &quot;Over the last 10 years the health service has become a shambles. We regularly have over 350 people on trolleys in A&amp;E, waiting lists that go on for months, outpatient waiting lists that go on for years and cancelled operations across the country...&quot;

Fine Gael launched its FairCare campaign and website in April 2009, which stated that the health service would be reformed away from a costly ineffective endeavour, into a publicly regulated system where compulsory universal health insurance would replace the existing provisions.

This strategy was criticised by Fianna Fáil&#x27;s then-Minister for Children, Barry Andrews. The spokesperson for family law and children, Alan Shatter TD, robustly defended its proposals as the only means of reducing public expenditure, and providing a service in Ireland more akin to the Canadian, German, Dutch and Austrian health systems.

Fine Gael&#x27;s current healthcare policy revolves around the implementation of Sláintecare, a cross-party plan for the reform of the Irish health system. Sláintecare is focused on introducing &quot;a universal single-tiered health service, which guarantees access based on need, not income… through Universal Health Insurance&quot;.

===Pro-Europeanism and defence policies===
Fine Gael is among the most pro-European integration parties in Ireland, having supported the European Constitution, the Lisbon Treaty, and advocating participation in European common defence. The party have been supportive of NATO. In 1998, party leader John Bruton called on Ireland to join the NATO-led Partnership for Peace. The party&#x27;s youth wing, Young Fine Gael, passed a motion in 2016 calling on the government to apply for membership of NATO.

Under Enda Kenny, the party called on the state to end Irish neutrality and to sign up for a European defence structure, with Kenny claiming that &quot;the truth is, Ireland is not neutral. We are merely unaligned.&quot; Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Fine Gael called for an increase in defence spending, with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney proposing an increase of €500 million a year and suggesting Ireland needed a &quot;fundamental rethink&quot; of its security approach.

Since Brexit, Fine Gael has taken a strong pro-European stance, stating that Ireland&#x27;s place is &quot;at the heart of Europe&quot;. In government, the party has launched the &quot;Global Ireland&quot; plan to develop alliances with other small countries across Europe and the world.

==European affiliations==
Fine Gael is a founding member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), the largest European political party comprising liberal conservative and Christian democratic national-level parties from across Europe. Fine Gael&#x27;s MEPs sit with the EPP Group in the European Parliament, and Fine Gael parliamentarians also sit with the EPP Groups in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and Committee of the Regions. Young Fine Gael is a member of the Youth of the European People&#x27;s Party (YEPP).

It is inferred from the party&#x27;s relationship with its European counterparts via membership of the European People&#x27;s Party that Fine Gael belongs on the centre-right. The party conforms generally with European political parties that identify themselves as being Christian democratic.

==Planning and payment tribunals==
The Moriarty Tribunal has sat since 1997 and has investigated the granting of a mobile phone license to Esat Telecom by Michael Lowry when he was Fine Gael Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in the Rainbow Coalition of the mid-1990s. Lowry resigned from the Cabinet after it was revealed at the Moriarty Tribunal that businessman Ben Dunne had paid for an IR£395,000 extension to Lowry&#x27;s County Tipperary home. Lowry, now an independent TD, supported the Fianna Fáil–Green Party government in Dáil Éireann until March 2011.

It was also revealed in December 1996 that Fine Gael had received some £180,000 from Ben Dunne in the period 1987 to 1993. This was composed of £100,000 in 1993, £50,000 in 1992 and £30,000 in 1989. In addition, Michael Noonan received £3,000 in 1992 towards his election campaign, Ivan Yates received £5,000, Michael Lowry received £5,000 and Sean Barrett received £1,000 in the earlier 1987 election. John Bruton said he had received £1,000 from Dunne in 1982 towards his election campaign, and Dunne had also given £15,000 to the Labour Party during the 1990 Presidential election campaign.

Following revelations at the Moriarty Tribunal on 16 February 1999, in relation to Charles Haughey and his relationship with AIB, former Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald confirmed that AIB and Ansbacher wrote off debts of almost £200,000 that he owed in 1993, when he was in financial difficulties because of the collapse of the aircraft leasing company, GPA, in which he was a shareholder. The write-off occurred after Fitzgerald left politics. Fitzgerald also said he believed his then Fine Gael colleague, Peter Sutherland, who was chairman of AIB at the time, was unaware of the situation.

==Leadership==
The leader of the Fine Gael party is Simon Harris. The position of deputy leader has been held since 2024 by Helen McEntee TD, the Minister for Justice.

===Party leader===

The following are the terms of office as party leader, and as Taoiseach (bolded) if applicable:
===Deputy leader===
===Seanad leader===
==Election results==
===Dáil Éireann===
=== Presidential elections ===
===European Parliament===
==Electoral performance since 2009==
In the 2009 local elections held on 5 June 2009, Fine Gael won 556 seats, surpassing Fianna Fáil which won 407 seats, and making Fine Gael the largest party of local government nationally. They gained 88 seats from their 2004 result.

In the 2009 European Parliament election held on the same day as the local elections, which saw a reduction in the number seats from 13 to 12 for Ireland, the party won four seats, retaining the largest number of seats of an Irish party in the European Parliament. This was a loss of one seat from its 2004 result.

In the 2011 general election, Fine Gael gained 25 seats bringing them to a total of 76. The party ran candidates in all 43 constituencies and had candidates elected in every constituency except Dublin North-West. Fine Gael won 19 seats in Seanad Éireann following the 2011 election, a gain of four from the previous election in 2007.

While Fine Gael was responsible for the initial nomination of the uncontested, first President of Ireland, Douglas Hyde, a Fine Gael candidate has never won an election to the office of president. The Fine Gael presidential candidate, Gay Mitchell, finished fourth in the 2011 presidential election, with 6.4% of the vote. In 2004, Fine Gael supported the re-election of President Mary McAleese. Similarly, it supported the re-election of Michael D. Higgins in the 2018 presidential election.

In the 2016 general election the outgoing government consisting of Fine Gael and its partner the Labour Party was defeated. The previous government had the largest majority in the history of the state with a combined 113 seats out of the 166-seat Dáil Éireann. The aftermath of the general election resulted in months of negotiations for an agreement of government. A deal was reached with the main opposition and traditional rival Fianna Fáil to facilitate a minority Fine Gael-led government. Fine Gael governed Ireland alone with eight Independent members of the Dáil until 2020, when the party emerged as the third party following the general election. After governing for several months in a caretaker capacity, Fine Gael agreed to serve in a historic coalition government along with its traditional rival, Fianna Fáil, and the Green Party, with Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin serving as Taoiseach and Leo Varadkar serving as Tánaiste.
As per the agreed Programme for Government, on 17 December 2022, Leo Varadkar returned to the role of Taoiseach with Micheál Martin as Tánaiste.

==Front bench==
==Young Fine Gael==

Young Fine Gael (YFG) is the autonomous youth movement of Fine Gael. It was founded in 1976 by the then leader Garret FitzGerald. It caters for young people under 35 with an interest in Fine Gael and politics, in cities, towns and third level colleges throughout Ireland. YFG is led by its national executive consisting of ten members elected on a regional basis, and on a national panel.

<doc id="11253" wikidata="Q1357701" url="?curid=11253" title="Fu Manchu">
<text>Dr. Fu Manchu () is a supervillain who was introduced in a series of novels by the English author Sax Rohmer beginning shortly before World War I and continuing for another forty years. The character featured in cinema, television, radio, comic strips and comic books for over 100 years, and he has also become an archetype of the evil criminal genius and mad scientist, while lending his name to the Fu Manchu moustache.

== Background and publication ==
According to his own account, Sax Rohmer decided to start the Dr. Fu Manchu series after his Ouija board spelled out C-H-I-N-A-M-A-N when he asked what would make his fortune. Clive Bloom argues that the portrait of Fu Manchu was based on the popular music hall magician Chung Ling Soo, &quot;a white man in costume who had shaved off his Victorian moustache and donned a Mandarin costume and pigtail&quot;. As for Rohmer&#x27;s theories concerning &quot;Eastern devilry&quot; and &quot;the unemotional cruelty of the Chinese&quot;, he seeks to give them intellectual credentials by referring to the travel writing of Bayard Taylor. Taylor was a would-be ethnographer who, though unversed in Chinese language and culture, used the pseudo-science of physiognomy to find in the Chinese race &quot;deeps on deeps of depravity so shocking and horrible, that their character cannot even be hinted&quot;. Rohmer&#x27;s protagonists treat him as an authority.

Fu Manchu first appeared in Rohmer&#x27;s short story &quot;The Zayat Kiss&quot; (1912). It and nine further stories were later collected into the 1913 novel &quot;The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu&quot;. Two more series were collected into &quot;The Devil Doctor&quot; (1916) and &quot;The Si-Fan Mysteries&quot; (1917), before the character entered a 14-year absence. Following 1931&#x27;s &quot;The Daughter of Fu-Manchu&quot;, Rohmer wrote nine more Fu Manchu novels before his death in 1959. Four previously published stories were posthumously collected into &quot;The Wrath of Fu-Manchu&quot; (1973). In total, Rohmer wrote 14 novels concerning the character. The image of &quot;Orientals&quot; invading Western nations became the foundation of Rohmer&#x27;s commercial success, being able to sell 20 million copies in his lifetime.

== Characters ==
=== Dr. Fu Manchu ===

Supervillain Dr. Fu Manchu&#x27;s murderous plots are marked by the extensive use of arcane methods; he disdains guns or explosives, preferring dacoits (armed robbers in India), Thugs (professional robbers and murderers in India) and members of other secret societies as his agents (usually armed with knives) or using &quot;pythons and cobras ... fungi and my tiny allies, the bacilli ... my black spiders&quot; and other peculiar animals or natural chemical weapons. He has a great respect for the truth (in fact, his word is his bond), and uses torture and other gruesome tactics to dispose of his enemies.

Dr. Fu Manchu is described as a mysterious villain because he seldom appears on the scene. He always sends his minions to commit crimes for him. In the novel &quot;The Insidious Dr Fu-Manchu&quot;, he sends a beautiful young girl to the crime scene to see that the victim is dead. He also sends a dacoit to attack Sir Denis Nayland Smith and Dr Petrie.

In the novel &quot;Fu Manchu&#x27;s Bride&quot; (1933), Dr. Fu Manchu claims to hold doctorates from four Western universities, while in &quot;Emperor Fu Manchu&quot; (1959), he states that he attended Heidelberg University, the Sorbonne and the University of Edinburgh. (In the film &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot;, however, he states proudly that &quot;I am a doctor of philosophy from Edinburgh, a doctor of law from Christ&#x27;s College, a doctor of medicine from Harvard. My friends, out of courtesy, call me &#x27;Doctor.) At the time of their first encounter (1911) Dr. Petrie believed that Dr Fu Manchu was more than 70 years old. That would mean that he studied for his first doctorate in the 1860s or 1870s.

According to Cay Van Ash, Rohmer&#x27;s biographer and former assistant who became the first author to continue the series after Rohmer&#x27;s death, &quot;Fu Manchu&quot; was a title of honor, which referred to &quot;the warlike Manchu&quot;. Van Ash speculates that Dr. Fu Manchu was a member of the imperial family of China who backed the losing side in the Boxer Rebellion. In the early books (1913–1917), Dr. Fu Manchu is an agent of a Chinese tong, known as the &quot;Si-Fan&quot;, and acts as the mastermind behind a wave of assassinations targeting Westerners living in China. In the later books (1931–1959), he has gained control of the &quot;Si-Fan&quot;, which has been changed from a mere Chinese tong into an international criminal organization under his leadership. In addition to attempting to take over the world and restore China to its former glory (Dr. Fu Manchu&#x27;s main goals right from the beginning), the &quot;Si-Fan&quot; now also tries to eliminate fascist dictators and halt the spread of communism around the globe, for its leader&#x27;s own selfish reasons. Dr. Fu Manchu knows that both fascism and communism present major obstacles to his plans for world domination. The &quot;Si-Fan&quot; is largely funded through criminal activities, particularly the drug trade and human trafficking. Dr. Fu Manchu has extended his already considerable lifespan by use of the elixir of life, a formula that he has spent decades trying to perfect.

=== Sir Denis Nayland Smith and Dr Petrie ===
Opposing Dr Fu Manchu in the stories are Sir Denis Nayland Smith and, in the first three books, Dr Petrie. Petrie narrates the first three novels. (The later novels are narrated by various other characters allied with Smith right up to the end of the series.) Smith carries on the fight, combating Dr Fu Manchu more by sheer luck and dogged determination than intellectual brilliance except &quot;in extremis&quot;. Smith and Dr Fu Manchu share a grudging respect for one another, as each believes that a man must keep his word, even to an enemy.

In the first three books, Smith serves in the Indian Imperial Police as a police commissioner in Burma who has been granted a roving commission, allowing him to exercise authority over any group who can help him in his mission. When Rohmer revived the series in 1931, Smith, who has been knighted for his efforts to defeat Fu Manchu, is an ex-Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard. He later accepts a position with MI6. Several books have him placed on special assignment with the FBI.

=== Kâramanèh ===
Prominent among Dr Fu Manchu&#x27;s agents is the &quot;seductively lovely&quot; Kâramanèh. Her real name is unknown. She was sold to the &quot;Si-Fan&quot; by Egyptian slave traders while she was still a child. Kâramanèh falls in love with Dr Petrie, the narrator of the first three books in the series, and rescues Petrie and Nayland Smith many times. Eventually the couple are united and she wins her freedom. They marry and have a daughter, Fleurette, who figures in two later novels, &quot;Fu Manchu&#x27;s Bride&quot; (1933) and its sequel, &quot;The Trail of Fu Manchu&quot; (1934). Lin Carter later created a son for Dr Petrie and Kâramanèh.

=== Fah Lo Suee ===
Dr Fu Manchu&#x27;s daughter, Fah Lo Suee, is a devious mastermind in her own right, frequently plotting to usurp her father&#x27;s position in the &quot;Si-Fan&quot; and aiding his enemies both within and outside the organization. Her real name is unknown; Fah Lo Suee was a childhood term of endearment. She is introduced anonymously while still a teenager in the third book in the series and plays a larger role in several of the titles of the 1930s and 1940s. She is known for a time as Koreani after being brainwashed by her father, but her memory is later restored. Like her father, she takes on false identities, among them Madame Ingomar, Queen Mamaloi and Mrs van Roorden. In films she has been portrayed by numerous actresses over the years. Her character is usually renamed in film adaptations because of difficulties with the pronunciation of her name. Anna May Wong played Ling Moy in &quot;Daughter of the Dragon&quot; (1931). Myrna Loy portrayed the similarly named Fah Lo See in &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; (1932). Gloria Franklin had the role of Fah Lo Suee in &quot;Drums of Fu Manchu&quot; (1940). Laurette Luez played Karamaneh in &quot;The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1956), but the character owed more to Fah Lo Suee than to Rohmer&#x27;s depiction of Kâramanèh. Tsai Chin portrayed Dr Fu Manchu&#x27;s daughter Lin Tang in the five Christopher Lee films of the 1960s.

Actors who have played Sir Denis Nayland Smith
== Cultural impact ==
The style of facial hair associated with Fu Manchu in film adaptations has become known as the Fu Manchu moustache. The &quot;Fu Manchu&quot; moustache is defined in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as a &quot;long, narrow moustache whose ends taper and droop down to the chin&quot;, although Rohmer&#x27;s writings described the character as wearing no such adornment.

Before the creation of Fu Manchu, Chinese people were often portrayed in Western media as victims. Fu Manchu indicated a new phase in which Chinese people were portrayed as perpetrators of crime and threats to Western society as a whole. Rohmer&#x27;s villain is presented as the kingpin of a plot by the &quot;yellow races&quot; threatening the existence of &quot;the entire white race&quot;, and his narrator opines, &quot;No white man, I honestly believe, appreciates the unemotional cruelty of the Chinese.&quot;

The character of Dr. Fu Manchu became, for many, a stereotype embodying the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;. For others, Fu Manchu became the most notorious personification of Western views of the Chinese, and became the model for other villains in contemporary &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; thrillers: these villains often had characteristics consistent with xenophobic and racist stereotypes which coincided with a significant increase in Chinese emigration to Western countries.

After the Second World War, the stereotype inspired by Fu Manchu increasingly became a subject of satire. Fred Fu Manchu, a &quot;famous Chinese bamboo saxophonist&quot;, was a recurring character on &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, a 1950s British radio comedy programme. He was featured in the episode &quot;The Terrible Revenge of Fred Fu Manchu&quot; in 1955 (announced as &quot;Fred Fu Manchu and his Bamboo Saxophone&quot;), and made minor appearances in other episodes (including &quot;China Story&quot;, &quot;The Siege of Fort Night&quot;, and in &quot;The Lost Emperor&quot; as &quot;Doctor Fred Fu Manchu, Oriental tattooist&quot;). The character was created and performed by the comedian Spike Milligan, who used it to mock the racist attitudes which had led to the creation of the character. The character was also parodied in a later radio comedy, &quot;Round the Horne&quot;, as Dr Chu En Ginsberg MA (failed), portrayed by Kenneth Williams.

Dr. Fu Manchu was parodied as the fiendish Dr. Wu in the action-comedy film &quot;Black Dynamite&quot; (2009), in which the executor of an evil plan against African Americans is an insidious, moustache-sporting kung fu master.

Science historian Fred Cooper and colleagues draws a parallel between narratives that COVID-19 was created by China, and the machinations of Fu Manchu, who is &quot;expert in the deadly application of animal and biological agents&quot; and who has been depicted on US television shows as threatening the West with lethal diseases.

== In other media ==
=== Film ===
Dr Fu Manchu first appeared on the big screen in the British silent film series &quot;The Mystery of Dr Fu Manchu&quot; (1923) starring Harry Agar Lyons, a series of 15 short feature films, each running around 20 minutes. Lyons returned to the role in &quot;The Further Mysteries of Dr Fu Manchu&quot; (1924), which comprised eight additional short feature films.

Dr Fu Manchu made his American film debut in Paramount Pictures&#x27; early talkie &quot;The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1929) starring Warner Oland, soon to be known for his portrayal of Charlie Chan. Oland repeated the role in &quot;The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1930) and &quot;Daughter of the Dragon&quot; (1931) as well as in the short film &quot;Murder Will Out&quot; (part of the omnibus film &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot;) in which Dr. Fu Manchu confronts both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes.

The most controversial incarnation of the character was MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; (1932) starring Boris Karloff and Myrna Loy. At the time of its first release the film was considered racist and offensive by representatives of the Chinese government. The film was suppressed for many years, but has been released on DVD uncut.

Dr Fu Manchu returned to the serial format in Republic Pictures&#x27; &quot;Drums of Fu Manchu&quot; (1940), a 15-episode serial considered to be one of the best the studio ever made. It was later edited and released as a feature film in 1943.

Other than an obscure, unauthorized Spanish spoof &quot;El Otro Fu Manchu&quot; (1946), the Devil Doctor was absent from the big screen for 25 years, until producer Harry Alan Towers began a series starring Christopher Lee in 1965. Towers and Lee made five Fu Manchu films: &quot;The Face of Fu Manchu&quot; (1965), &quot;The Brides of Fu Manchu&quot; (1966), &quot;The Vengeance of Fu Manchu&quot; (1967), &quot;The Blood of Fu Manchu&quot; (1968), and &quot;The Castle of Fu Manchu&quot; (1969).

The character&#x27;s last authorised film appearance was in the Peter Sellers spoof &quot;The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1980), with Sellers featured as both Dr Fu Manchu and Nayland Smith. The film bore little resemblance to any earlier film or the original books. Fu Manchu claims he was known as &quot;Fred&quot; at public school, a reference to the character in &quot;The Terrible Revenge of Fred Fu Manchu&quot;, a 1955 episode of &quot;The Goon Show&quot; which had co-starred Sellers.

Jesús Franco, who directed &quot;The Blood of Fu Manchu&quot; and &quot;The Castle of Fu Manchu&quot;, also directed &quot;The Girl from Rio&quot;, the second of three Harry Alan Towers films based on Rohmer&#x27;s Fu Manchu-like female character Sumuru. He later directed an unauthorized 1986 Spanish film featuring Dr Fu Manchu&#x27;s daughter, &quot;Esclavas del Crimen&quot;.

In the film &quot;Grindhouse&quot; (2007), Nicolas Cage makes an uncredited comedic cameo appearance as Dr Fu Manchu during the &quot;trailer&quot; for the fake film &quot;Werewolf Women of the SS&quot;, directed by Rob Zombie.

A composite character of Fu Manchu and the Mandarin, named Xu Wenwu, appears in Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four film &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot;, portrayed by Tony Leung Chiu-wai. The character was previously referenced in the &quot;Iron Man&quot; trilogy and &quot;All Hail the King&quot;. Xialing, Wenwu&#x27;s daughter and Shang-Chi&#x27;s sister, was partially inspired by Fah Lo Suee.

=== Television ===
A half-hour pilot was produced in 1952 for NBC&#x27;s consideration starring Cedric Hardwicke as Sir Denis Nayland Smith, John Carradine as Dr. Fu Manchu, and Reed Hadley as Dr. John Petrie. NBC turned it down without broadcasting it, but it has been screened at special events.

The television arm of Republic Pictures produced a 13-episode syndicated series, &quot;The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1956), starring Glen Gordon as Dr. Fu Manchu, Lester Matthews as Sir Denis Nayland Smith, and Clark Howat as Dr. John Petrie. The title sequence depicted Smith and Dr. Fu Manchu in a game of chess as the announcer stated that &quot;the devil is said to play for men&#x27;s souls. So does Dr. Fu Manchu, evil incarnate.&quot; At the conclusion of each episode, after Nayland Smith and Petrie had foiled Dr. Fu Manchu&#x27;s latest fiendish scheme, Dr. Fu Manchu would be seen breaking a black chess piece in a fit of frustration (black king&#x27;s bishop, always the same scene, repeated) just before the closing credits rolled. It was directed by Franklin Adreon, as well as William Witney. Dr. Fu Manchu was never allowed to succeed in this TV series. Unlike the Holmes/Watson type relationship of the films, the series featured Smith as a law enforcement officer and Petrie as a staff member for the Surgeon-General. Though Republic had planned to film 78 episodes for the series, a dispute with Sax Rohmer ended the series after only 13 episodes were produced.

=== Music ===
* American stoner rock band Fu Manchu was formed in Southern California in 1985.
* Desmond Dekker had a 1969 reggae song titled &quot;Fu Man Chu&quot;.
* The Sparks song &quot;Moustache&quot; from the 1982 album &quot;Angst in My Pants&quot; includes a lyric &quot;My Fu Manchu was real fine&quot;.
* The Rockin&#x27; Ramrods had a 1965 song based on the film &quot;The Face of Fu Manchu&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fool with Fu Manchu&quot;.
* Quebec rock singer Robert Charlebois included an epic three-part song titled &quot;Fu Man Chu&quot; on his 1972 album &quot;Charlebois&quot;.
* Russian hardbass artist XS Project has a 2016 song named &quot;Fu Manchu&quot;.
* American country music singer Tim McGraw published a song called &quot;Live Like You Were Dying&quot;. The song references Dr. Fu Manchu in the lyric &quot;I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu&quot;.
* American country music singer Travis Tritt published a song called &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Day to Be Alive&quot;. Dr. Fu Manchu&#x27;s iconic moustache is referenced in the lyric &quot;Might even grow me a Fu Manchu&quot;.
* Japanese electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra published a song called &quot;La Femme Chinoise&quot;, in which they reference the supervillain: &quot;Fu Manchu and Susie Que and the girls of the floating world&quot;.
* American rock musician Black Francis released a song entitled &quot;Fu Manchu&quot; on his 1993 solo album &quot;Frank Black&quot;, which references both the style of moustache as well as the character after which it was named.
* British band The Kinks song &#x27;The Village Green Preservation Society&#x27;, released in 1968, includes a reference to Fu Manchu in the lyric &quot;Help save Fu Manchu, Moriarty and Dracula&quot;.

=== Radio ===
Dr. Fu Manchu&#x27;s earliest radio appearances were on &quot;The Collier Hour&quot; 1927–1931 on the Blue Network. This was a radio program designed to promote &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine and presented weekly dramatizations of the current issue&#x27;s stories and serials. Dr. Fu Manchu was voiced by Arthur Hughes. A self-titled show on CBS followed in 1932–33. John C. Daly, and later Harold Huber, played Dr. Fu Manchu.
In 2010, Fu Manchu&#x27;s connections with the University of Edinburgh where he supposedly obtained a doctorate were investigated in a mockumentary by Miles Jupp for BBC Radio 4.
Additionally, there were &quot;pirate&quot; broadcasts from the continent into Britain, from Radio Luxembourg and Radio Lyons in 1936 through 1937. Frank Cochrane voiced Dr. Fu Manchu. The BBC produced a competing radio play, &quot;The Peculiar Case at the Poppy Club&quot; written by Rohmer and broadcast in December 1938. In 1939, &quot;The Shadow of Fu Manchu&quot; aired in the United States as a thrice-weekly serial dramatizing the first nine novels.

=== Comic strips ===
Dr. Fu Manchu was first brought to newspaper comic strips in a black and white daily comic strip drawn by Leo O&#x27;Mealia (1884–1960) that ran from 1931 to 1933. The strips were adaptations of the first two Dr. Fu Manchu novels and part of the third. Unlike most other illustrators, O&#x27;Mealia drew Dr. Fu Manchu as a clean-shaven man with an abnormally large cranium. The strips were copyrighted by &quot;Sax Rohmer and The Bell Syndicate, Inc.&quot; Two of the Dr. Fu Manchu comic strip storylines were reprinted in the 1989 book &quot;Fu Manchu: Two Complete Adventures&quot;. In 1940, the Chicago Tribune published an adaptation of &quot;Drums of Fu Manchu&quot;, at first it was a photo comics, but later it was illustrated by a unicredit artist.

Between 1962 and 1973, the French newspaper &quot;Le Parisien Libéré&quot; published a comic strip by Juliette Benzoni (script) and Robert Bressy (art).

=== Comic books ===

* Dr. Fu Manchu made his first comic book appearance in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #17 and continued, as one feature among many in the anthology series, until #28. These were reprints of the earlier Leo O&#x27;Mealia strips. In 1943, the serial &quot;Drums of Fu Manchu&quot; was adapted by Spanish comic artist José Grau Hernández in 1943. Original Dr. Fu Manchu stories in comics had to wait for Avon&#x27;s one-shot &quot;The Mask of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; in 1951 by Wally Wood. Fleetway published an adaptation of &quot;The Island of Fu Manchu&quot; in 1956 through their &quot;pocket library&quot; title &quot;Super Detective Library&quot; #9.
* In the 1970s, Dr. Fu Manchu appeared as the father of the superhero Shang-Chi in the Marvel Comics series &quot;Master of Kung Fu.&quot; However, Marvel cancelled the book in 1983 and issues over licensing the character and concepts from the novels (such as his daughter Fah Lo Suee and adversaries Sir Denis Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie) have hampered Marvel&#x27;s ability to both collect the series in trade paperback format and reference Dr. Fu Manchu as Shang-Chi&#x27;s father. As such, the character is either never mentioned by name, or by an alias (such as &quot;Mr. Han&quot;). In &quot;Secret Avengers&quot; #6–10, writer Ed Brubaker officially sidestepped the entire issue via a storyline where the Shadow Council resurrect a zombified version of Dr. Fu Manchu, only to discover that &quot;Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; was only an alias; that Shang-Chi&#x27;s father was really Zheng Zu, an ancient Chinese sorcerer who discovered the secret to immortality. Later, Fah Lo Suee was renamed Zheng Bao Yu.
* Dr. Fu Manchu appears as an antagonist in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;. Simply called &quot;the Doctor&quot;, he is the first to steal the Cavorite that the League is sent to retrieve. He is apparently killed in the climactic battle with Professor Moriarty.
* Fu Manchu makes a cameo appaerence in an issue of the &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; web comics. In the comics, Fu Manchu is a spy and one of nine mercenaries hired at some point in the 1850s by twins Redmond and Blutarch Mann to fight in the &quot;Gravel War&quot;, a conflict about the lands in New Mexico owned by the brothers. 

=== Role-playing games ===
Fu Manchu appears in the adventures &quot;Night Moves&quot; and &quot;Night Live&quot; for the role-playing game &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;.

== Accusations of racism ==

The stories of Dr Fu Manchu, both in print and on screen, have sparked accusations of racism and orientalism, from his fiendish design to his nonsensical Chinese name. After the release of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; (1932), which featured the Chinese villain telling his followers that they must &quot;kill the white man and take his women&quot;, the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, issued a formal complaint against the film.

Following the release of Republic Pictures&#x27; serial adaptation of &quot;Drums of Fu Manchu&quot; (1940) the U.S. State Department requested that the studio make no further films about the character, as China was an ally against Japan during the Second World War. Likewise, Rohmer&#x27;s publisher, Doubleday, refused to publish additions to the best-selling series for the duration of the Second World War once the United States entered the conflict. BBC Radio and Broadway investors subsequently rejected Rohmer&#x27;s proposals for an original Fu Manchu radio serial and stage show during the 1940s.

The re-release of &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; in 1972 was met with protests from the Japanese American Citizens League, which stated that &quot;the movie was offensive and demeaning to Asian Americans&quot;. CBS Television decided to cancel a showing of &quot;The Vengeance of Fu Manchu&quot;. Los Angeles TV station KTLA shared similar sentiments, but ultimately decided to run &quot;The Brides of Fu Manchu&quot; with the disclaimer: &quot;This feature is presented as fictional entertainment and is not intended to reflect adversely on any race, creed or national origin.&quot;

Rohmer responded to charges that his work demonized Asians in &quot;Master of Villainy&quot;, a biography co-written by his widow:

It was Rohmer&#x27;s contention that he based Dr Fu Manchu and other &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; mysteries on real Chinese criminals he met as a newspaper reporter covering Limehouse.

In May 2013, General Motors cancelled an advertisement after complaints that a phrase it contained, &quot;the land of Fu Manchu&quot;, which was intended to refer to China, was offensive.

Characterizing Dr Fu Manchu as an overtly racist creation has been criticized in the book &quot;Lord of Strange Deaths: The Fiendish World of Sax Rohmer&quot;. In a review of the book in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Dr Fu Manchu is contextualised: &quot;These magnificently absurd books, glowing with a crazed exoticism, are really far less polar, less black and white, less white and yellow, than they first seem.&quot;

<text>Friesland ( ; ; official ), historically and traditionally known as Frisia (), named after the Frisians, is a province of the Netherlands located in the country&#x27;s northern part. It is situated west of Groningen, northwest of Drenthe and Overijssel, north of Flevoland, northeast of North Holland, and south of the Wadden Sea. As of January 2023, the province had a population of about 660,000, and a total area of .

The province is divided into 18 municipalities. The capital and seat of the provincial government is the city of Leeuwarden (West Frisian: &quot;Ljouwert&quot;, Liwwaddes: &quot;Liwwadde&quot;), a city with 123,107 inhabitants. Other large municipalities in Friesland are Sneek (pop. 33,512), Heerenveen (pop. 50,257), and Smallingerland (includes town of Drachten, pop. 55,938). Since 2017, Arno Brok is the King&#x27;s Commissioner in the province. A coalition of the Christian Democratic Appeal, the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, the Labour Party, and the Frisian National Party forms the executive branch. The area of the province was once part of the ancient, larger region of Frisia, which gave the province its name. The land is mostly made up of grassland and it has numerous lakes. The official languages of Friesland are West Frisian and Dutch.

==Toponymy==
In 1996, the Provincial Council of Friesland resolved that the official name of the province should follow the West Frisian spelling rather than the Dutch spelling, resulting in &quot;Friesland&quot; being replaced by &quot;Fryslân&quot;. In 2004, the Dutch government confirmed this resolution, putting in place a three-year scheme to oversee the name change and associated cultural programme.

The province of Friesland is occasionally referred to as &quot;Frisia&quot; by, amongst others, Hanno Brand, head of the history and literature department at the Fryske Akademy since 2009. However, the English-language webpage of the Friesland Provincial Council refers to the province as &quot;Fryslân&quot;.

==History==
===Prehistory===

The Frisii were among the migrating Germanic tribes that, following the breakup of Celtic Europe in the 4th century BC, settled along the North Sea. They came to control the area from roughly present-day Bremen to Bruges, and conquered many of the smaller offshore islands. What little is known of the Frisii is provided by a few Roman accounts, most of them military. Pliny the Elder said their lands were forest-covered with tall trees growing up to the edge of the lakes. They lived by agriculture and raising cattle.

In his &quot;Germania&quot;, Tacitus described all the Germanic peoples of the region as having elected kings with limited powers and influential military leaders who led by example rather than by authority. The people lived in spread-out settlements. He specifically noted the weakness of Germanic political hierarchies in reference to the Frisii, when he mentioned the names of two kings of the 1st century Frisii and added that they were kings &quot;as far as the Germans are under kings&quot;.

In the 1st century BC, the Frisii halted a Roman advance and thus managed to maintain their independence. Some or all of the Frisii may have joined into the Frankish and Saxon peoples in late Roman times, but they would retain a separate identity in Roman eyes until at least 296, when they were forcibly resettled as &quot;laeti&quot; (Roman-era serfs) and thereafter disappear from recorded history. Their tentative existence in the 4th century is confirmed by archaeological discovery of a type of earthenware unique to 4th-century Frisia, called &quot;terp Tritzum&quot;, showing that an unknown number of Frisii were resettled in Flanders and Kent, likely as &quot;laeti&quot; under the aforementioned Roman coercion. The lands of the Frisii were largely abandoned by as a result of the conflicts of the Migration Period, climate deterioration, and the flooding caused by a rise in the sea level.

===Early Middle Ages===

The area lay empty for one or two centuries, when changing environmental and political conditions made the region habitable again. At that time, during the Migration Period, &quot;new&quot; Frisians (probably descended from a merging of Frisii, Angles, Saxons and Jutes) repopulated the coastal regions. These Frisians consisted of tribes with loose bonds, centred on war bands but without great power. The earliest Frisian records name four social classes, the (&quot;nobiles&quot; in Latin documents; &quot;adel&quot; in Dutch and German) and (&quot;vrijen&quot; in Dutch and &quot;Freien&quot; in German), who together made up the &quot;Free Frisians&quot; who might bring suit at court, and the &quot;laten&quot; or &quot;liten&quot; with the slaves, who were absorbed into the &quot;laten&quot; during the Early Middle Ages, as slavery was not so much formally abolished, as evaporated. The &quot;laten&quot; were tenants of lands they did not own and might be tied to it in the manner of serfs, but in later times might buy their freedom.

Under the rule of King Aldgisl, the Frisians came in conflict with the Frankish mayor of the palace Ebroin, over the old Roman border fortifications. Aldgisl could keep the Franks at a distance with his army. During the reign of Redbad, however, the tide turned in favour of the Franks; in 690, the Franks were victorious in the Battle of Dorestad. In 733, Charles Martel sent an army against the Frisians. The Frisian army was pushed back to Eastergoa. The next year the Battle of the Boarn took place. Charles ferried an army across the Almere with a fleet that enabled him to sail up to De Boarn. The Frisians were defeated in the ensuing battle, and their last king Poppo was killed. The victors began plundering and burning heathen sanctuaries. Charles Martel returned with much loot, and broke the power of the Frisian kings for good. The Franks annexed the Frisian lands between the Vlie and the Lauwers. They conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785, when Charlemagne defeated Widukind. The Carolingians laid Frisia under the rule of &quot;grewan&quot;, a title that has been loosely related to count in its early sense of &quot;governor&quot; rather than &quot;feudal overlord&quot;. About 100,000 Dutch drowned in a flood in 1228.

===Frisian freedom===

When, around 800, the Scandinavian Vikings first attacked Frisia, which was still under Carolingian rule, the Frisians were released from military service on foreign territory in order to be able to defend themselves against the heathen Vikings. With their victory in the Battle of Norditi in 884 they were able to drive the Vikings permanently out of East Frisia, although it remained under constant threat. Over the centuries, whilst feudal lords reigned in the rest of Europe, no aristocratic structures emerged in Frisia. This &#x27;Frisian freedom&#x27; was represented abroad by &quot;redjeven&quot; who were elected from among the wealthier farmers or from elected representatives of the autonomous rural municipalities. Originally the &quot;redjeven&quot; were all judges, so-called &quot;Asega&quot;, who were appointed by the territorial lords.

After significant territories were lost to Holland in the Friso-Hollandic Wars, Frisia saw an economic downturn in the mid-14th century. Accompanied by a decline in monasteries and other communal institutions, social discord led to the emergence of untitled nobles called &quot;haadlingen&quot; (&quot;headmen&quot;), wealthy landowners possessing large tracts of land and fortified homes who took over the role of the judiciary as well as offering protection to their local inhabitants. Internal struggles between regional leaders resulted in bloody conflicts and the alignment of regions along two opposing parties: the Fetkeapers and Skieringers. On 21 March 1498, a small group of Skieringers from Westergo secretly met with Albert III, Duke of Saxony, the Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, in Medemblik requesting his help. Albrecht, who had gained a reputation as a formidable military commander, accepted and soon conquered all Friesland. Emperor Maximilian of Habsburg appointed Albrecht hereditary potestate and gubernator of Friesland in 1499.

In 1515, an army of haadlingen and peasants, with the help of mercenaries known as the Arumer Zwarte Hoop, started a fight for freedom from oppression by the Habsburg authorities. One of the leaders was Pier Gerlofs Donia, whose farm had been burned down and whose kinfolk had been killed by a marauding &quot;Landsknecht&quot; regiment. Since the regiment had been employed by the Habsburg authorities to suppress the civil war of the Fetkeapers and Skieringers, Donia put the blame on the authorities. After this he gathered angry peasants and some petty noblemen from Frisia and Gelderland and formed the &quot;Arumer Zwarte Hoop&quot;.The rebels received financial support from Charles II, Duke of Guelders, who claimed the Duchy of Guelders in opposition to the House of Habsburg. Charles also employed mercenaries under command of his military commander Maarten van Rossum in their support. However, when the tides turned against the rebels after the Donia&#x27;s death in 1520, Charles withdrew his support, without which the rebels could no longer afford to pay their mercenary army. The revolt was put to an end in 1523 and Frisia was incorporated into the Habsburg Netherlands, bringing an end to the Frisian freedom.

===Modern times===
Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, became the first lord of the Lordship of Frisia. He appointed Georg Schenck van Toutenburg, who had crushed the peasants&#x27; revolt, as Stadtholder to rule over the province in his stead. When Charles abdicated in 1556, Frisia was inherited by Philip II of Spain along with the rest of the Netherlands. In 1566, Frisia joined the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule.

In 1577, George de Lalaing, Count of Rennenberg was appointed Stadtholder of Frisia and other provinces. A moderate, trusted by both sides, he tried to reconcile the rebels with the Crown. But in 1580, Rennenburg declared for Spain. The States of Frisia raised troops and took his strongholds of Leeuwarden, Harlingen and Stavoren. Rennenburg was deposed and Frisia became the fifth Lordship to join the rebels&#x27; Union of Utrecht. From 1580 onward, all stadtholders were members of the House of Orange-Nassau. With the Peace of Münster in 1648, Frisia became a full member of the independent Dutch Republic, a federation of provincies. In economic and therefore also political importance, Friesland was next in rank to the provinces of Holland and Zeeland.

In 1798, three years after the Batavian Revolution, the provincial lordship of Frisia was abolished and its territory was divided between the Eems and Oude IJssel departments. This was short-lived, however, as Frisia was revived as a department in 1802. When the Netherlands were annexed by the First French Empire in 1810, the department was in French renamed Frise. After Napoleon was defeated in 1813 and a new constitution was introduced in 1814, Friesland became a province of the Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands, then of the unitary Kingdom of the Netherlands a year later.

==Geography==


Friesland is situated at in the northwest of the Netherlands, west of the province of Groningen, northwest of Drenthe and Overijssel, north of Flevoland, northeast of the IJsselmeer and North Holland, and south of the North Sea. It is the largest province of the Netherlands if one includes areas of water; in terms of land area only, it is the third-largest province.

Most of Friesland is on the mainland, but it also includes a number of West Frisian Islands, including Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog, which are connected to the mainland by ferry. The province&#x27;s highest point is a dune at above sea level, on the island of Vlieland.

There are four national parks of the Netherlands located in Friesland: Schiermonnikoog, De Alde Feanen, Lauwersmeer (partially in Groningen), and Drents-Friese Wold (also partially situated in Drenthe).

=== Urban areas ===
The ten urban areas in Friesland with the largest population are:

=== Municipalities ===
The province is divided into 18 municipalities, each with local government (municipal council, mayor and aldermen).

===Climate===
The province of Friesland, like the rest of the Netherlands, has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;).
==Demography==
In 2023, Friesland had a population of 659,551 and a population density of .

The years 1880–1900 show slower population growth due to an agricultural recession during which some 20,000 Frisians emigrated to the United States.


===Anthropometry===
Since the late Middle Ages, Friesland has been renowned for the exceptional height of its inhabitants. Even early Renaissance poet Dante Alighieri refers to the height of Frisians in his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; when, in the canticle about Hell, he talks about the magnitude of an infernal demon by stating that &quot;not even three tall Frieslanders, were they set one upon the other, would have matched his height&quot;.

==Religion==
In 2015, 28.5% of the population belonged to the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, while 6.6% were Roman Catholic, 1.1% were Muslim and 6.5% belonged to other churches or faiths. Over half of the population (57.2%) identified as non-religious.

==Economy==
Friesland is mainly an agricultural province. The black and white Frisian cattle, black and white Stabyhoun and the black Frisian horse originated here. Tourism is another important source of income: the principal tourist destinations include the lakes in the southwest of the province and the islands in the Wadden Sea to the north. There are 195 windmills in the province of Friesland, out of a total of about 1200 in the entire country.

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 19.8 billion € in 2018, accounting for 2.6% of the Netherlands economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €26,700 or 89% of the EU27 average in the same year.

== Culture ==
=== Languages ===
Friesland is one of the twelve provinces of the Netherlands to have its national language that is recognized as such, West Frisian. Before the 18th century, varieties of Frisian were also spoken in the provinces of North Holland and Groningen, and together with the Frisian speakers in East Friesland and North Friesland a continuous linguistic area existed between Amsterdam and the present day Danish-German border.

The mutual intelligibility in reading between Dutch and Frisian is limited. A cloze test in 2005 revealed native Dutch speakers understood 31.9% of a West Frisian newspaper, 66.4% of an Afrikaans newspaper and 97.1% of a Dutch newspaper. In 2007, West Frisian is the native language of 54.3% of the inhabitants of the province of Friesland, followed by Dutch with 34.7%, and speakers of other regional languages, most of these restricted to Friesland, with 9.7%, and in the end other foreign languages with 1.4%. Frisian speakers are traditionally underrepresented in urban areas, and predominant in the countryside.

West Frisian is also spoken in a small adjacent part of the province of Groningen. Up to the 18th century Frisian was spoken in the, at that time Prussian and Hanoverian, lordships of East Friesland). Since then the East Frisian population switched to East Frisian (&quot;Ostfriesisch&quot;), a Low German dialect. Only in some, formerly remoted, East Frisian villages (Saterland) a variety of historically East Frisian (&quot;Seeltersk&quot;) is still in use but by an older generation. A collection of dialects named North Frisian, is or was spoken in North Friesland, alongside the North Sea coast and on the islands of Schleswig-Holstein. The named Frisian languages are historically related to Old English, which points towards the fact that Angles and Saxons, eventually accompanied by Frisians, came from these areas.

In Stellingwerf, in south-east Friesland, a dialect of Low Saxon is spoken, as is in the northeast in Kollumerpomp.

In the former municipality of het Bildt the Hollandic dialect of Bildts is spoken. It contains a lot of Frisian influence. In most of the cities of Leeuwarden, Town Frisian is spoken. As with Bildts, these variants are Hollandic dialects with Frisian influence.

The language policy in Friesland is preservation. West Frisian is a mandatory subject in Friesland in primary and secondary schools of the Frisian speaking districts. Bilingual (Dutch–Frisian) and trilingual (Dutch–English–Frisian) schools in the province of Friesland use West Frisian as a language of instruction in some lessons, besides Dutch in most other lessons and alongside them English. Literacy in Frisian however, is not often a core aim and that makes the number of Frisians speakers able to write in Frisian only 12%.

The provincial government takes various initiatives to preserve the West Frisian language. All parents in Friesland receive, at their children&#x27;s birth, information about language and multilingualism (e.g. &#x27;taaltaske&#x27;). To support the use of Frisian in public and at public events, the province also invests in the development of speech pathology materials and strives to create information technology devices for the West Frisian language. The Frisian government subsidizes the &quot;Afûk&quot; organization, which offers language courses and actively promotes Frisian in all sectors of society as well as the corporate domain which as a rule is dominated by Dutch and English. The province also promotes a wide range of art and entertainment in Frisian.

=== Sports ===
The province is famous for its speed skaters, with mass participation in cross-country ice skating when weather conditions permit. When winters are cold enough to allow the freshwater canals to freeze hard, the province holds its traditional Elfstedentocht (Eleven cities tour), a ice skating tour. A traditional sport is Frisian handball. Another Frisian practice is &quot;fierljeppen&quot;, a sport with some similarities to pole vaulting. A jump consists of an intense sprint to the pole (&quot;polsstok&quot;), jumping and grabbing it, then climbing to the top while trying to control the pole&#x27;s forward and lateral movements over a body of water and finishing with a graceful landing on a sand bed opposite to the starting point. Because of all the diverse skills required in fierljeppen, fierljeppers are considered to be very complete athletes with superbly developed strength and coordination. In the warmer months, many Frisians practice &quot;wadlopen&quot;, the traditional art of wading across designated sections of the Wadden Sea at low tide.
Friesland has lots of waterways and lakes there for Sailcontests with a Skutsje or frisian Tjalk is done during the summer on various lakes.

There are currently two professional football clubs playing in Friesland: SC Cambuur from Leeuwarden (home stadium Cambuur Stadion) active in de keuken kampioen divisie(2nd div.) and SC Heerenveen (home stadium Abe Lenstra Stadion) active in de Eredivisie(1st div.).

== Politics ==
The King&#x27;s Commissioner of Friesland is Arno Brok. The Provincial Council of Friesland has 43 seats. The Provincial Executive was a coalition of the Christian Democratic Appeal, the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, the Labour Party and the Frisian National Party (FNP), until 2023 when new provincial elections saw a different composition in the provincial council.

<text>Feminist science fiction is a subgenre of science fiction (abbreviated &quot;SF&quot;) focused on such feminist themes as: gender inequality, sexuality, race, economics, reproduction, and environment. Feminist SF is political because of its tendency to critique the dominant culture. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using utopias to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or dystopias to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue.
==Definition==
Feminist science fiction is a sub-genre of science fiction (SF for short) that focuses on theories that include feminist themes, for example gender inequality, sexuality, race, economics and reproduction. Feminist science fiction spans a wider range than science fiction itself, covering fantasy, utopia and dystopia, horror (such as Anne Rice&#x27;s vampire stories). Marleen S. Barr says that what is described as feminist ‘SF’ is not really ‘SF’ at all, because it is not concerned with ‘hard science’ but with women&#x27;s drive for power. Hard science fiction is of course a subset of science fiction. She thought we needed to use a term like feminist fabulation.

Fantasy literature is de facto a privileged genre for tackling feminist themes. Because it allows to reflect on the future, on the possibilities of humanity and science, this literature allows all progressive and innovative ideas to coexist. So, to qualify as feminist science fiction, the stories must carry a political message, that of challenging the male/female paradigm in society. With this in mind, in the early 1990s the American feminist fanzine Aurora SF published a list of ten levels of feminism to measure the political content of a text. This graduation of the political message ranges from simple questioning of patriarchal society, to egalitarian discourse between the sexes, to systematic criticism of men, to the establishment of feminist and lesbian utopia.

In her book &quot;In the chinks of the world machine: feminism and science fiction&quot;, Scottish author Sarah LeFanu distinguishes between feminist SF and women&#x27;s SF insofar as the latter, while having a certain influence on the development of science fiction in general by rejecting sexism and featuring female heroes, does not make feminist demands.

Feminist science fiction (SF) distinguishes between &quot;female&quot; SF authors and &quot;feminist&quot; SF authors. Both female and feminist SF authors are historically significant to the feminist SF subgenre, as female writers have increased women&#x27;s visibility and perspectives in SF literary traditions, while the feminist writers have foregrounded political themes and tropes in their works. Because distinctions between female and feminist can be blurry, whether a work is considered feminist can be debatable, but there are generally agreed-upon canonical texts, which help define the subgenre.

==History==
===Early modern times===
As early as the English Restoration, female authors were using themes of SF and imagined futures to explore women&#x27;s issues, roles, and place in society. This can be seen as early as 1666 in Margaret Cavendish&#x27;s &quot;The Blazing World&quot;, in which she describes a utopian kingdom ruled by an empress. This foundational work has garnered attention from some feminist critics, such as Dale Spender, who considered this a forerunner of the science fiction genre, more generally. Another early female writer of science fiction was Mary Shelley. Her novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818) dealt with the asexual creation of new life, and has been considered by some a reimagining of the Adam and Eve story.

Her book is a critique of Darwinist ideas and also of the use of science without ethical reflection, as well as of the seventeenth-century view that science was endowed with a certain virility aimed at penetrating the secrets of nature, presented as other, feminine and objectified. The book paved the way for future explorations of the cyborg theme by feminist science fiction and had a lasting influence.

In France, feminist writer Marie-Anne de Roumier-Robert&#x27;s &quot;Voyage de Milord Céton dans les sept planètes&quot;, published in 1758, is considered one of the first science fiction novels. Refusing to overlook the contribution made by women to science and culture for the sole benefit of men, Marie-Anne Robert wrote an initiatory tale designed to develop women&#x27;s critical faculties, and ultimately work towards their emancipation.

===First-wave feminism (suffrage)===
Women writers involved in the utopian literature movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries could be considered the first feminist SF authors. Their texts, emerging during the first-wave feminist movement, often addressed issues of sexism through imagining different worlds that challenged gender expectations. In 1881, &quot;Mizora: A Prophecy&quot; described a women-only world with technological innovations such as parthenogenesis, videophones, and artificial meat.

It was closely followed by other feminist utopian works, such as Elizabeth Burgoyne Corbett&#x27;s &quot;New Amazonia: A Foretaste of the Future&quot; (1889). In 1892, poet and abolitionist Frances Harper published &quot;Iola Leroy&quot;, one of the first novels by an African American woman. Set during the antebellum South, it follows the life of a mixed race woman with mostly white ancestry and records the hopes of many African Americans for social equality—of race and gender—during Reconstruction. &quot;Unveiling a Parallel&quot; (1893) features a male protagonist who takes an &quot;aeroplane&quot; to Mars, visiting two different &quot;Marsian&quot; societies; in both, there is equality between men and women. In one, Paleveria, women have adopted the negative characteristics of men; in Caskia, the other, gender equality &quot;has made both sexes kind, loving, and generous.&quot; Two American Populists, A.O. Grigsby and Mary P. Lowe, published &quot;NEQUA or The Problem of the Ages&quot; (1900), which explores issues of gender norms and posited structural inequality. This recently rediscovered novel displays familiar feminist SF conventions: a heroine narrator who masquerades as a man, the exploration of sexist mores, and the description of a future hollow earth society (like &quot;Mizora&quot;) where women are equal.

&quot;The Sultana&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1905), by Bengali Muslim feminist Rokeya Sakhawat Hussain, engages with the limited role of women in colonial India. Through depicting a gender-reversed purdah in an alternate technologically futuristic world, Rokeya Sakhawat Hussain,&#x27;s book has been described as illustrating the potential for cultural insights through role reversals early on in the subgenre&#x27;s formation.

In the utopian novel &quot;Beatrice the Sixteenth&quot; (1909), transgender writer Irene Clyde creates a world where gender is no longer recognized and the story itself is told without the use of gendered nouns. Along these same lines, Charlotte Perkins Gilman explores and critiques the expectations of women and men by creating a single-sex world in &quot;Herland&quot; (1915), possibly the most well-known of the early feminist SF and utopian novels.

Among the francophones, Renée Marie Gouraud dʻAblancourt published in 1909 &quot;Vega la magicienne&quot;, depicting L&#x27;Oiselle, a winged superheroine and the first of the francophone superhero series.

Rhoda Broughton is also one of a number of 19th-century women writing in the successful science fiction genre.

Rosa Rosà (Edith von Haynau) wrote the first Italian feminist science fiction with &quot;Una donna con tre anime&quot; in 1918.

===Between the wars===
During the 1920s and 1930s, many popular pulp science fiction magazines exaggerated views of masculinity and featured portrayals of women that were perceived as sexist. These views would be subtly satirized by Stella Gibbons in &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; (1932) and much later by Margaret Atwood in &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; (2000). As early as 1920, however, women writers of this time, such as Clare Winger Harris (&quot;The Runaway World,&quot; 1926) and Gertrude Barrows Bennett (&quot;Claimed&quot;, 1920), published science fiction stories written from female perspectives and occasionally dealt with gender and sexuality based topics.

John Wyndham, writing under his early pen-name of John Beynon Harris, was a rare pulp writer to include female leads in stories such as The Venus Adventure (Wonder Stories, 1932), in which a mixed crew travel to Venus. The story opens in a future in which women are no longer enslaved by pregnancy and childbirth thanks to artificial incubators, which are opposed by a religious minority. Women have used this freedom to enter professions including chemistry. Wyndham&#x27;s outlook was so rare that in a serialisation of his novel Stowaway to Mars, one magazine editor &quot;corrected&quot; the name of the central character Joan to John. Wyndham then had to write them a new final instalment to replace the conclusion in which Joan fell in love and became pregnant. 

====&quot;The Fate of the Poseidonia&quot;, 1927====

The first science fiction story published in a magazine by a woman in America was &quot;The Fate of the Poseidonia&quot;, written by Claire Winger Harris in 1927. The story was published by Hugo Gernsback in the pulp magazine Amazing Stories. The story was published as part of a science fiction competition, in which 300 short stories were proposed. Hugo Gernsback put out a call to his magazine&#x27;s readership for this competition, inviting them to send in texts describing the cover of Amazing Stories in December 1926. The cover featured an ocean liner floating in space. Using the term ‘fans’ to describe his male and female readers, blurring the boundary between readership and writing, he allowed women to take part for the first time. The 1920s saw the establishment of what was later to become ‘fandom’.

===Post World War II===
The Post-WWII and Cold War eras were a pivotal and often overlooked period in feminist SF history. During this time, female authors utilized the SF genre to assess critically the rapidly changing social, cultural, and technological landscape. Women SF authors during the post-WWII and Cold War time periods directly engage in the exploration of the impacts of science and technology on women and their families, which was a focal point in the public consciousness during the 1950s and 1960s. These female SF authors, often published in SF magazines such as &quot;The Avalonian&quot;, &quot;Astounding&quot;, &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, and &quot;Galaxy&quot;, which were open to new stories and authors that pushed the boundaries of form and content.

At the beginning of the Cold War, economic restructuring, technological advancements, new domestic technologies (washing machines, electric appliances), increased economic mobility of an emerging middle class, and an emphasis on consumptive practices, carved out a new technological domestic sphere where women were circumscribed to a new job description – the professional housewife. Published feminist SF stories were told from the perspectives of women (characters and authors) who often identified within traditional roles of housewives or homemakers, a subversive act in many ways given the traditionally male-centered nature of the SF genre and society during that time.

In &quot;Galactic Suburbia&quot;, author Lisa Yaszek recovers many women SF authors of the post-WWII era such as Judith Merril, author of &quot;That Only a Mother&quot; (1948), &quot;Daughters of Earth&quot; (1952), &quot;Project Nursemaid&quot; (1955), &quot;The Lady Was a Tramp&quot; (1957); Alice Eleanor Jones &quot;Life, Incorporated&quot; (1955), &quot;The Happy Clown&quot; (1955), &quot;Recruiting Officer&quot; (1955); and Shirley Jackson &quot;One Ordinary Day, with Peanuts&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Omen&quot; (1958). These authors often blurred the boundaries of feminist SF fiction and feminist speculative fiction, but their work laid substantive foundations for second-wave feminist SF authors to directly engage with the feminist project. &quot;Simply put, women turned to SF in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s because it provided them with growing audiences for fiction that was both socially engaged and aesthetically innovative.&quot;

===Second-wave feminism===
By the 1960s, science fiction was combining sensationalism with political and technological critiques of society. With the advent of second-wave feminism, women&#x27;s roles were questioned in this &quot;subversive, mind expanding genre&quot;. Three notable texts of this period are Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; (1969), Marge Piercy&#x27;s &quot;Woman on the Edge of Time&quot; (1976) and Joanna Russ&#x27;s &quot;The Female Man&quot; (1970). Each highlights what the authors believe to be the socially constructed aspects of gender roles by creating worlds with genderless societies. Two of these authors were pioneers in feminist criticism of science fiction during the 1960s and 1970s through essays collected in &quot;The Language of the Night&quot; (Le Guin, 1979) and &quot;How To Suppress Women&#x27;s Writing&quot; (Russ, 1983). Also of note, Madeleine L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; (1962), written for children and teens, features a 13-year-old girl protagonist, Meg Murry, whose mother, Mrs. Murry, is a scientist with degrees in biology and bacteriology. L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s novel is decidedly science fiction, feminist, and deeply Christian, and the first of her series, &quot;The Time Quintet&quot;. Meg&#x27;s adventures to other planets, galaxies, and dimensions are aided in &quot;Wrinkle&quot; by three ancient beings, Mrs What, Mrs Which, and Mrs Who who &quot;tesser&quot; to travel vast distances. &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1963 and has never been out of print. Men also contributed literature to feminist science fiction. Prominently, Samuel R. Delany&#x27;s short story, &quot;Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones&quot; (1968), which won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1970, follows the life of a gay man that includes themes involving sadomasochism, gender, significance of language, and when high and low society encounter one another, while his novel &quot;Babel-17&quot; has a Chinese woman as its primary hero and protagonist. Octavia Butler&#x27;s &quot;Kindred&quot; (1979) tells the story of an African American woman living in the United States in 1979 who uncontrollably time travels to the antebellum South. The novel poses complicated questions about the nature of sexuality, gender, and race when the present faces the past.

&quot;The Demon Breed&quot; is a 1968 science fiction novel by James H. Schmitz in which the female main character, Nyles Etland, armed only with intelligence and intimate knowledge of her home environment, allies and science, intimidated an alien species who had intended to invade. Schmitz, who still commands a cult audience half a century after his death, dealt almost exclusively in competent and intelligent female main characters in dozens of novels and short stories.

===1980s onwards===
Feminist science fiction continues on into the 1980s with Margaret Atwood&#x27;s novel &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1985), a dystopic tale of a theocratic society in which women have been systematically stripped of all liberty. The book was motivated by fear of potential retrogressive effects on women&#x27;s rights. Sheri S. Tepper is perhaps best known for her series The True Game, which explore the &quot;Lands of the True Game&quot;, a portion of a planet explored by humanity somewhere in the future. In November 2015, she received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement for this series. Tepper has written under several pseudonyms, including A. J. Orde, E. E. Horlak, and B. J. Oliphant. Carol Emshwiller is another feminist SF author whose best known works are &quot;Carmen Dog&quot; (1988), &quot;The Mount&quot; (2002), and &quot;Mister Boots&quot; (2005). Emshwiller had also been writing SF for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; since 1974. She won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2005 for her novel &quot;The Mount&quot; (2002). This novel explores the prey/predator mentality through an alien race. Another author of the 1980s, Pamela Sargent has written the &quot;Seed Series&quot;, which included &quot;Earthseed&quot;, &quot;Farseed&quot;, and &quot;Seed Seeker&quot; (1983–2010), the &quot;Venus Series&quot; about the terraforming of Venus, which includes &quot;Venus of Dreams&quot;, &quot;Venus of Shadows&quot;, and &quot;Child of Venus&quot; (1986–2001), and &quot;The Shore of Women&quot; (1986). Sargent is also the 2012 winner of the Pilgrim Award for lifetime contributions to SF/F studies. Lois McMaster Bujold has won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for her novella &quot;The Mountains of Mourning&quot;, which is part of her series the &quot;Vorkosigan Saga&quot; (1986–2012). This saga includes points of view from a number of minority characters, and is also highly concerned with medical ethics, identity, and sexual reproduction.

More recent science fiction authors illuminate what they contend are injustices that are still prevalent. At the time of the LA Riots, Japanese-American writer Cynthia Kadohata&#x27;s work &quot;In the Heart of the Valley of Love&quot; (1992) was published. Her story, set in the year 2052, examines tensions between two groups as defined as the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have-nots&quot; and is written as seen through the eyes of a nineteen-year-old girl who is of Asian and African descent. Nalo Hopkinson&#x27;s &quot;Falling in Love With Hominids&quot; (2015) is a collection of her short stories whose subjects range from an historical fantasy involving colonialism in the Caribbean, to age manipulation, to ethnic diversity in the land of Faerie, among others.

In the early 1990s, a new award opportunity for feminist SF authors was created. The James Tiptree, Jr. Award is an annual literary prize for works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore one&#x27;s understanding of gender (Alice Sheldon was a female writer who published science fiction under the Tiptree pen name). Science fiction authors Pat Murphy and Karen Joy Fowler initiated this subsequent discussion at WisCon in February 1991. The authors&#x27; publishing in feminist SF after 1991 were now eligible for an award named after one of the genre&#x27;s beloved authors. Karen Joy Fowler herself is considered a feminist SF writer for her short stories, such as &quot;What I Didn&#x27;t See&quot;, for which she received the Nebula Award in 2004. This story is an homage to Sheldon, and describes a gorilla hunting expedition in Africa. Pat Murphy won a number of awards for her feminist SF novels as well, including her second novel &quot;The Falling Woman&quot; (1986), a tale of personal conflict and visionary experiences set during an archaeological field study for which she won the Nebula Award in 1988. She won another Nebula Award in the same year for her story &quot;Rachel in Love&quot;. Her short story collection, &quot;Points of Departure&quot; (1990) won the Philip K. Dick Award, and her 1990 novella &quot;Bones&quot; won the 1991 World Fantasy Award.

Other winners of the James Tiptree, Jr. Award include &quot;The Sparrow&quot; by Mary Doria Russell (1996), &quot;Black Wine&quot; by Candas Jane Dorsey (1997), &quot;Redwood and Wildfire&quot; by Andrea Hairston (2011), &quot;The Carhullan Army&quot; by Sarah Hall (2007), &quot;Ammonite&quot; by Nicola Griffith (1993), and &quot;The Conqueror&#x27;s Child&quot; by Suzy McKee Charnas (1999). All of these authors have had an important impact on the SF world by adding a feminist perspective to the traditionally male genre.

Eileen Gunn&#x27;s science fiction short story &quot;Coming to Terms&quot; received the Nebula Award (2004) in the United States and the Sense of Gender Award (2007) in Japan, and has been nominated twice each for the Hugo Award, Philip K. Dick Award and World Fantasy Award, and short-listed for the James Tiptree, Jr. Award. Her most popular anthology of short stories is &quot;Questionable Practices&quot;, which includes stories &quot;Up the Fire Road&quot; and &quot;Chop Wood, Carry Water&quot;. She also edited &quot;The WisCon Chronicles 2: Provocative Essays on Feminism, Race, Revolution, and the Future&quot; with L. Timmel Duchamp. Duchamp has been known in the feminist SF community for her first novel &quot;Alanya to Alanya&quot; (2005), the first of a series of five titled &quot;The Marq&#x27;ssan Cycle&quot;. &quot;Alanya to Alanya&quot; is set on a near-future earth controlled by a male-dominated ruling class patterned loosely after the corporate world of today. Duchamp has also published a number of short stories, and is an editor for Aqueduct Press. Lisa Goldstein is another well respected feminist sf author. The novelette &quot;Dark Rooms&quot; (2007) is one of her better known works, and another one of her novels, &quot;The Uncertain Places&quot;, won the Mythopoeic Award for Best Adult Novel in 2012.

==Recurrent themes==
Works of feminist science fiction are often similar in the goals they work towards as well as the subjects and plotlines they focus on in order to achieve those goals. Feminist science fiction is science fiction that carries across feminist ideals and the promotion of societal values such as gender equality, and the elimination of patriarchal oppression. Feminist science fiction works often present tropes that are recurrent across science fiction with an emphasis on gender relations and gender roles. Many elements of science fiction, such as cyborgs and implants, as well as utopias and dystopias, are given context in a gendered environment, providing a real contrast with present-day gender relations while remaining a work of science fiction.

===Utopian and dystopian societies===
Representations of utopian and dystopian societies in feminist science fiction place an increased emphasis on gender roles while countering the anti-utopian philosophies of the 20th century. Male philosophers such as John Rawls, Isaiah Berlin, and Michael Oakeshott often criticize the idea of utopia, theorizing that it would be impossible to establish a utopia without violence and hegemony. Many male authored works of science fiction as well as threads of philosophical utopian thought dismiss utopias as something unattainable, whereas in feminist science fiction, utopian society is often presented as something both achievable and desirable.

Anti-utopian philosophies and feminist science fiction come to odds in the possibility of achieving utopia. In &quot;Rehabilitating Utopia: Feminist Science Fiction and Finding the Ideal&quot;, an article published in Contemporary Justice Review, philosophers against the dream of utopia argue that &quot;First is the expectation that utopia justifies violence, second is the expectation that utopia collapses individual desires into one communal norm, and third is the expectation that utopia mandates a robotic focus on problem-solving.&quot; In feminist science fiction, utopias are often realized through a communal want for an ideal society. One such novel is summarized in the aforementioned article, Charlotte Perkins Gilman&#x27;s novel &quot;Herland&quot;, in which &quot;Gilman perfectly captures the utopian impulse that all problems are solvable. She establishes a society where every consideration about a question aims for the rational answer.&quot; Gilman&#x27;s utopia is presented as something attainable and achievable without conflict, neither enabling violence nor extinguishing individualism.

In the Parable series by feminist science fiction novelist Octavia Butler, anti-utopian philosophies are criticized via a dystopian setting. In the first novel, &quot;Parable of the Sower&quot;, following the destruction of her home and family, Lauren Olamina, one of many who live in a dystopian, ungoverned society, seeks to form her own utopian religion entitled &#x27;Earthseed&#x27;. Olamina&#x27;s utopian creation does not justify the use of violence as a means, no matter how expedient, to justify the end, achieving utopia, no matter how desirable. Yet we witness that she cannot avoid violence, as it results from little more than promulgating ideas different from those held by the majority of those living within the current social structure, however disorganized and ungoverned that social structure may be. Butler posits that utopian society can never be achieved as an entity entirely separate from the outside world, one of the more commonly held beliefs about conditions necessary to achieve utopia. Olamina&#x27;s, and Butler&#x27;s, utopia is envisioned as a community with a shared vision that is not forced on all within it.

One common trend in feminist science fiction utopias is the existence of utopian worlds as single-gendered – most commonly female, an early example being Emília Freitas’s 1899 novel &quot;A Rainha do Ignoto&quot;. In literary works female utopias are portrayed as free of conflict, and intentionally free of men. The single gendered utopias of female science fiction are free of the conflicts that feminism aims to eliminate, such as patriarchal oppression and the gender inequality inherent in patriarchal society. In a statement about these single gendered utopias, Joanna Russ, author of &quot;The Female Man&quot; , theorized that male-only societies were not written because in patriarchal society, male oppression is not as pressing an issue as is female oppression.

Utopia as an ideal to strive for is not a concept wholly limited to feminist science fiction, however many non-feminist science fiction works often dismiss utopia as an unachievable goal, and as such, believe that pursuits for utopia should be considered dangerous and barren. Anti-utopian theory focuses on the &#x27;how&#x27; in the transition from present society to a utopian future. In feminist science fiction, the achievement of a utopian future depends on the ability to recognize the need for improvement and the perseverance to overcome the obstacles present in creating a utopian society.

===Representation of women===
Perhaps the most obvious attraction of science fiction to women writers – feminist or not – is the possibilities it offers for the creation of a female hero. The demands of realism in the contemporary or historical novel set limits which do not bind the universes available to science fiction. Although the history of science fiction reveals few heroic, realistic, or even original images of women, the genre had a potential recognized by the women writers drawn to it in the 1960s and 1970s. Before this time, the appeal for women writers was not that great. The impact of feminism on the science fiction field can be observed not only in science fiction texts themselves, but also on the development of feminist approaches to science fiction criticism and history, as well as conversations and debates in the science fiction community. One of the main debates is about the representation of women in science fiction.

In her article &quot;Redefining Women&#x27;s Power through Feminist Science Fiction&quot;, Maria DeRose suggests that, &quot;One of the great early socialists said that the status of women in a society is a pretty reliable index of the degree of civilization of that society. If this is true, then the very low status of women in science fiction should make us ponder about whether science fiction is civilized at all&quot;. The women&#x27;s movement has made most of us conscious of the fact that Science Fiction has totally ignored women. This &quot;lack of appreciation&quot; is the main reason that women are rebelling and actively fighting to be noticed in the field anyway.

Virginia Wolf relates to this aspect of feminist science fiction in the article &quot;Feminist Criticism and Science Fiction for Children&quot;. As she discusses the scarcity of women in the field, she states, &quot;During the first period, that of the nineteenth century, apparently only two women wrote Science Fiction, Mary Shelley and Rhoda Broughton,&quot; and continues, &quot;In the early twentieth century, a few women were successful Science Fiction writers&quot;. But, &quot;The times changed. Repression gave way to questioning and outright rebellion, and in the Science Fiction of the 1960s stylistic innovations and new concerns emerged &#x27;Many of their stories, instead of dealing with the traditional hardware of science fiction, concentrated on the effects that different societies or perceptions would have on individual characters&#x27;&quot;. Andre Norton, a semi-well known analyst of Science fiction argues along these lines as well. As Norton explored one or more novels she came across, she realized that the creation of characters and how they are shown is a clear connection to the real world situation. From here, she goes in depth of characters in these feminist novels and relates them to the real world. She concludes here article along these lines. She wanted to get the idea out that feminists have a way to get their voice out there. Now, all their works are famous/ popular enough for their ideas to be let out. Virginia Wolf can attest to this fact. She introduced the idea that women were not represented well in the field till the early 1900s and added to the fact by stating, &quot;Women are not represented well in Science Fiction&quot;.

Individual characters, as we come to know, have their own perception and observation of their surroundings. Characters in novels such as &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; by James Tiptree and Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; are fully aware of the situation at hand and their role in society. This idea is a continuation of the argument presented by Andre Norton. Wolf argues the same point in her analysis of Le Guin&#x27;s writing, who has many contributions to the works of feminist Science Fiction. Wolf argues, &quot;What matters to Le Guin is not what people look like or how they behave but whether or not they have choice and whether or not they receive respect for who they are and what they do rather than on the basis of sex. Feminism is for her not a matter of how many women (or characters in Science Fiction) are housewives but a part of our hope for survival, which she believes lies in the search for balance and integration&quot;. This stirs up many questions about equality (a debate which has been going on for many years) but nobody seems to have an answer. In this continual search for equality, many characters find themselves asking the same question: &quot;Is Gender Necessary&quot; (which is, coincidentally, one of Le Guin&#x27;s novels and also another problem arising from gender biases). Robin Roberts, an American literary historian, addresses the link of these characters and what that means for our society today. Roberts believes that men and women would like to be equal, but are not equal. They should be fighting the same battle when in fact they are fighting each other. She also debates that gender equality has been a problem in every reach of feminism, not just in feminist science fiction. Wolf also tackles this problem, &quot;As she explains in &quot;Is Gender Necessary?&quot;, &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; convinced her that if men and women were completely and genuinely equal in their social roles, equal legally and economically, equal in freedom, in responsibility, and in self-esteem, ... our central problem would not be the one it is now: the problem of exploitation—exploitation of the woman, of the weak, of the earth&#x27; (p. 159)&quot;. Science fiction criticism has come a long way from its defensive desire to create a canon. All of these authors demonstrate that science fiction criticism tackles the same questions as other literary criticism: race, gender, and the politics of Feminism itself. Wolf believes that evaluating primarily American texts, written over the past one hundred and twenty years, these critics locate science fiction&#x27;s merits in its speculative possibilities. At the same time, however, all note that the texts they analyze reflect the issues and concerns of the historical period in which the literature was written. DeRose introduces her article with, in effect, the same argument. She says, &quot;the power of women in Science Fiction has greatly depreciated in the past few years&quot;.

===Gender identity===
Feminist science fiction offers authors the opportunity to imagine worlds and futures in which women are not bound by the standards, rules, and roles that exist in reality. Rather, the genre creates a space in which the gender binary might be troubled and different sexualities may be explored.

As Anna Gilarek explains, issues of gender have been a part of feminist discourse throughout the feminist movement, and the work of authors such as Joanna Russ and Marge Piercy explore and expose gender based oppression. Gilarek outlines two approaches to social critique via Feminist SF: the use of fantastical elements such as &quot;invented worlds, planets, moons, and lands&quot;, used to call attention to the ills of society by exaggerating them, or a more straightforward approach, &quot;relying on realist techniques to convey the message about the deficiencies of our world and its social organization, in particular the continued inequality of women&quot;. There are many examples of redefined gender roles and gender identity found in Feminist SF, ranging from the inversion of gendered oppression to the amplification of gender stereotypes and tropes. In the short story &quot;The Matter of Seggri&quot;, by Ursula Le Guin, traditional gender roles are completely swapped. Men are relegated to roles of athletes and prostitutes while women control the means of production and have exclusive access to education. In Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, gendered oppression is exaggerated in a dystopian society in which women&#x27;s rights are stripped away and fertile women are relegated to the roles of handmaids who will bear children to further the human race. New books continue the dystopian theme of women living in a society which conforms to the wishes of men, at the expense of women&#x27;s rights and well-being, such as in Louise O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s young adult novel &quot;Only Ever Yours&quot;. In this work, females are no longer born naturally but are genetically designed before birth to conform to the physical desires of men, then placed in a school in which they are taught not to think (they are never taught to read), and to focus on appearance until they are rated by beauty on a scale at age sixteen, with the top ten becoming the brides of elite men, the middle ten forced into concubinage, and the bottom ten forced to continue their lives as instructors at the school in very humiliating circumstances. At age forty, the women are euthanized. In the post-apocalyptic novel, &quot;Gather the Daughters&quot;, by Jennie Melamed, females living in an island society are sexually exploited from the time they are girls, are forced to marry at adolescence, and after they become grandmothers must commit suicide.

Over the decades, SF and feminist SF authors have taken different approaches to criticizing gender and gendered society. Helen Merrick outlines the transition from what Joanna Russ describes as the &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; tradition to a more egalitarian or androgynous approach. Also known as the &quot;Dominant Woman&quot; stories, the &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; stories often present matriarchal societies in which women have overcome their patriarchal oppressors and have achieved dominance. These stories are representative of an anxiety that perceives women&#x27;s power as a threat to masculinity and the heterosexual norm. As Merrick explains, &quot;And whilst they may at least hint at the vision of a more equal gendered social order, this possibility is undermined by figuring female desire for greater equality in terms of a (stereotypical) masculine drive for power and domination.&quot; Examples of these types of stories, written in the 1920s and 30s through the 50s, include Francis Steven&#x27;s &quot;Friend Island&quot; and Margaret Rupert&#x27;s &quot;Via the Hewitt Ray&quot;; in 1978, Marion Zimmer Bradley released &quot;The Ruins of Isis&quot;, a novel about a futuristic matriarchy on a human colony planet where the men are extremely oppressed.

In the 1960s and 1970s, feminist SF authors shifted from the &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; writing more egalitarian stories and stories that sought to make the feminine more visible. Ursula Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; portrayed an androgynous society in which a world without gender could be imagined. In James Tiptree Jr.&#x27;s short story &quot;Houston, Houston, Do You Read?&quot;, women are able to be seen in their full humanity due to the absence of men in a post-apocalyptic society. Joanna Russ&#x27;s works, including &quot;When it Changed&quot; and &quot;The Female Man&quot; are other examples of exploring femininity and a &quot;deconstruction of the acceptable, liberal &#x27;whole&#x27; woman towards a multiple, shifting postmodernist sense of female &#x27;selfhood&#x27;&quot;.

==Comic books and graphic novels==
Feminist science fiction is evidenced in the globally popular mediums of comic books, manga, and graphic novels. One of the first appearances of a strong female character was that of the superhero Wonder Woman, co-created by husband and wife team William Moulton Marston and Elizabeth Holloway Marston. In December 1941, Wonder Woman came to life on the pages of &quot;All Star Comics&quot;, and in the intervening years has been reincarnated in from animated TV series to live-action films, with significant cultural impact. By the early 1960s, Marvel Comics already contained some strong female characters, although they often suffered from stereotypical female weakness such as fainting after intense exertion. By the 1970s and 1980s, true female heroes started to emerge on the pages of comics. This was helped by the emergence of self-identified feminist writers including Ann Nocenti, Linda Fite, and Barbara Kesel. As female visibility in comics increased, the &quot;fainting heroine&quot; type began to fade into the past. However, some female comic book writers, such as Gail Simone, believe that female characters are still relegated to plot devices (see &quot;Women in Refrigerators&quot;).

Feminism in science fiction shōjo manga has been a theme in the works of Moto Hagio among others, for whom the writings of Ursula K. Le Guin have been a major influence.

==Film and television==
Feminism has driven the creation of a considerable body of action-oriented science fiction with female protagonists: Wonder Woman (originally created in 1941) and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; during the time of the organized women&#x27;s movement in the 1970s; &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; and the &quot;Alien tetralogy&quot; in the 1980s; and &quot;Xena, Warrior Princess&quot;, comic book character &quot;Red Sonja&quot;, and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. 2001 science fiction TV series &quot;Dark Angel&quot; featured a powerful female protagonist, with gender roles between her and the main male character generally reversed.

However, feminists have also created science fiction that directly engages with feminism beyond the creation of female action heroes. Television and film have offered opportunities for expressing new ideas about social structures and the ways feminists influence science. Feminist science fiction provides a means to challenge the norms of society and suggest new standards for how societies view gender. The genre also deals with male/female categories, showing how female roles can differ from feminine roles. Hence feminism influences the film industry by creating new ways of exploring and looking at masculinity/femininity and male/female roles. A contemporary example of feminist science fiction television can be found in &quot;Orphan Black&quot;, which deals with issues of reproductive justice, science, gender, and sexuality.

==Fandom==
By the 1970s, the science fiction community was confronting questions of feminism and sexism within science fiction culture itself. Multiple Hugo-winning fan writer and professor of literature Susan Wood and others organized the &quot;feminist panel&quot; at the 1976 World Science Fiction Convention against considerable resistance. Reactions to the appearance of feminists among fannish ranks led indirectly to the creation of &quot;A Women&#x27;s APA&quot; and WisCon.

Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender.

==Publications==
In the 1970s, the first feminist science fiction publications were created. The most well-known are fanzines &quot;The Witch and the Chameleon&quot; (1974–1976) and &quot;Janus&quot; (1975–1980), which later became &quot;Aurora SF&quot; (Aurora Speculative Feminism) (1981–1987). Windhaven, &quot;A Journal of Feminist Science Fiction&quot; was published from 1977 to 1979 by Jessica Amanda Salmonson in Seattle. Special issues of magazines linked to science fiction meetings were also published at that moment, like the Khatru symposium&#x27;s fanzine &quot;Women in Science Fiction&quot; in 1975.

==Critical works==
===&quot;Femspec&quot;===
&quot;Femspec&quot; is a feminist academic journal specializing in works that challenge gender through speculative genres, including science fiction, fantasy, magical realism, mythic explorations in poetry and post-modern fiction, and horror. There is a conscious multicultural focus of the journal, both in content and in the diverse makeup of its editorial group. The first issue came out in 1999 under the editorial direction of founder Batya Weinbaum, who is still the Editor-in-Chief. &quot;Femspec&quot; is still publishing and has brought over 1000 authors, critics and artists into print. Having lost their academic home in May 2003, they increasingly cross genres and print write-ups of all books and media received, as well as of events that feature creative works that imaginatively challenge gender such as intentional communities, performance events, and film festivals.

<text>Fellatio (also known as fellation, and in slang as blowjob, BJ, giving head, or sucking off) is an oral sex act consisting of the stimulation of a penis by using the mouth. Oral stimulation of the scrotum may also be termed &quot;fellatio&quot;, or colloquially as &quot;teabagging&quot;. 

It may be performed by a sexual partner as foreplay before other sexual activities, such as vaginal or anal intercourse, or as an erotic and physically intimate act of its own. Fellatio creates a risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but the risk is significantly lower than that of vaginal or anal sex, especially for HIV transmission.

Most countries do not have laws banning the practice of fellatio, though some cultures may consider it taboo. People may also refrain from engaging in fellatio due to personal preference, negative feelings, or sexual inhibitions. Commonly, people do not view oral sex as affecting the virginity of either partner, though opinions on the matter vary.

==Etymology==
The English noun &quot;fellatio&quot; comes from the Latin &#x27;, the past participle of the verb &#x27;, meaning &quot;to suck&quot;. In &quot;fellatio&quot;, the &quot;-us&quot; is replaced by the &quot;-io&quot; while the declension stem ends in &quot;-ion-&quot;, which gives the suffix the form &quot;-ion&quot; (cf. French &quot;fellation&quot;). The &quot;-io&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) ending is used in English to create nouns from Latin adjectives and it can indicate a state or action wherein the Latin verb is being, or has been, performed.

Further English words have been created based on the same Latin root. A person who performs fellatio upon another (i.e. who &quot;fellates&quot;) may be termed a &quot;fellator.&quot; Latin&#x27;s gender based declension means this word may be restricted to describing a male. The equivalent term for a female is &quot;fellatrix&quot;.

==Practice==
===General===
The essential aspect of fellatio is oral stimulation of the penis (including the shaft and glans) through sucking with the mouth, use of the tongue for licking, using the lips, or some combination. One method is the sex partner taking the penis into the mouth and moving smoothly up and down to a rhythm while being careful to avoid contact with the teeth. Fellatio also includes oral stimulation of the scrotum, whether licking, sucking or taking the entire scrotum into the mouth. During the act, orgasm may be achieved and semen may be ejaculated into the partner&#x27;s mouth. When the penis is thrust into someone&#x27;s mouth, it is called &quot;irrumatio&quot;, though the term is rarely used.

Performing fellatio can trigger the gag reflex. 

It is physically possible for men with sufficient flexibility, penis size, or both, to perform fellatio on themselves as a form of masturbation, in an act called autofellatio. However, few men possess the flexibility and penis length to safely perform the necessary frontbend.

===Deposition of semen===

During fellatio, a partner may ingest semen from the penis. As late as 1976, some doctors were advising women in the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy not to swallow semen lest it induce premature labor, but it was later determined to be safe.

The receiver of fellatio typically becomes sexually aroused. Once the prerequisite level of sexual stimulation has been achieved and ejaculation becomes imminent, the semen may be discharged onto his partner. The male may position his penis prior to ejaculation so that semen will be deposited onto his partner&#x27;s face (known as a &quot;facial&quot;), or other body part such as their neck, chest or breast.

===Deep-throating===

Deep-throating is a sexual act in which a person takes a partner&#x27;s entire erect penis into the mouth and throat. The technique and term became popularized by the 1972 pornographic film &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. For deep-throating, the penis must be long enough so that it can reach the back of the receiver&#x27;s throat.

Deep-throating can be difficult because of the natural gag reflex that is triggered when the soft palate is touched. People have different sensitivities to this reflex. With practice, some learn to suppress it. Deep-throating leads to a different kind of sexual stimulation of the penis than regular fellatio: the tongue&#x27;s movement is restricted during deep-throating and sucking becomes impossible; the tightness of the pharynx can intensely stimulate the glans of the penis.

===Other aspects===

The male receiving fellatio receives direct sexual stimulation, while his partner may derive satisfaction from giving him pleasure. Giving and receiving fellatio may happen simultaneously in sex positions like 69 and daisy chain.

Fellatio is sometimes practiced when vaginal or anal penetration would create a physical difficulty for a sex partner. For example, it may be practiced during pregnancy instead of vaginal intercourse by couples wishing to engage in intimate sexual activity while avoiding the difficulty of vaginal intercourse during later stages of pregnancy.

Other reasons why a woman may not wish to have vaginal intercourse include apprehension of losing her virginity or of becoming pregnant, or because she may be menstruating.

==Health aspects==

===Sexually transmitted infections===

Chlamydia, human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be transmitted through oral sex. Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.

There is an increased risk of STI transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on their genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in their mouth, or bleeding gums. Brushing the teeth, flossing, or undergoing dental work soon before or after giving fellatio can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth. These wounds, even when they are microscopic, increase the chances of contracting STIs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions. Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common bacteria and viruses found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of the aforementioned factors, medical sources advise the use of condoms or other effective barrier methods when performing or receiving fellatio with a partner whose STI status is unknown.

===HPV and oral cancer link===
Links have been reported between oral sex and oral cancer with HPV-infected people.

A 2007 study suggested a correlation between oral sex and throat cancer. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV, a virus that has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers and which has been detected in throat cancer tissue in numerous studies. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral sex partners had a 250 percent increased risk.

===Pregnancy and semen exposure===
Fellatio cannot result in pregnancy, as there is no way for ingested sperm to reach the uterus and fallopian tubes to fertilize an egg cell. At any rate, acids in the stomach and digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract break down and kill spermatozoa.

Clinical research has tentatively linked fellatio with immune modulation, indicating it may reduce the chance of complications during pregnancy. The potentially fatal complication pre-eclampsia was observed to occur less in women who regularly engaged in fellatio, with those who also ingested their partner&#x27;s semen being at the least risk. The results were consistent with the fact that semen contains TGF-β1, the exchange of which between partners has a causal reduction in risk of pre-eclampsia caused by an immunological reaction. However, fellatio is not the only viable mechanism for the transmission of TGF-β1.

==Cultural views==

===Virginity===

Oral sex is commonly used as a means of preserving virginity, especially among heterosexual pairings; this is sometimes termed &quot;technical virginity&quot; (which additionally includes anal sex, manual sex and other non-penetrative sex acts, but excludes penile-vaginal sex). The concept of &quot;technical virginity&quot; or sexual abstinence through oral sex is particularly popular among teenagers in the United States, including with regard to teenage girls who not only fellate their boyfriends to preserve their virginities, but also to create and maintain intimacy or to avoid pregnancy. Other reasons given for the practice among teenage girls are peer-group pressure and as their introduction to sexual activity. Additionally, gay males may regard fellatio as a way of maintaining their virginities, with penile-anal penetration defined as resulting in virginity loss, while other gay males may define fellatio as their main form of sexual activity.

===Legality===
Fellatio is legal in most countries. Laws of some jurisdictions regard fellatio as penetrative sex for the purposes of sexual offenses with regard to the act, but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice, in contrast to anal sex or extramarital sex. In Islamic literature, the only forms of sexual activity that are consistently explicitly prohibited within marriage are anal sex and sexual activity during menstruation. However, the exact attitude towards oral sex is a subject of disagreements between modern scholars of Islam. Authorities considering it &quot;objectionable&quot; do so because of the penis&#x27; supposedly impure fluids coming in contact with the mouth. Others emphasize that there is no decisive evidence to forbid oral sex.

In Malaysia, fellatio is illegal, but the law is seldom enforced. Under Malaysia&#x27;s Section 377A of the Penal Code, the introduction of the penis into the anus or mouth of another person is considered a &quot;carnal intercourse against the order of nature&quot; and is punishable with imprisonment of 20 years maximum and whipping.

===Tradition===

Galienus called fellatio &quot;lesbiari&quot; since women of the island of Lesbos were supposed to have introduced the practice of using one&#x27;s lips to give sexual pleasure.
The Ancient Indian &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;, dating from the first century AD, describes oral sex, discussing fellatio in great detail (the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; has a chapter on (or ), &quot;mouth congress&quot;) and only briefly mentioning cunnilingus. However, according to the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;, fellatio is above all a characteristic of eunuchs (or, according to other translations, of effeminate homosexuals or trans women similar to the modern Hijra of India), who use their mouths as a substitute for female genitalia.

Vātsyāyana, the author of the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;, states that it is also practiced by &quot;unchaste women&quot;, but mentions that there are widespread traditional concerns about this being a degrading or unclean practice, with known practitioners being evaded as love partners in large parts of the country. The author appears to somewhat agree with these attitudes, claiming that &quot;a wise man&quot; should not engage in that form of intercourse while acknowledging that it can be appropriate in some unspecified cases.

The Moche culture of ancient Peru depicted fellatio in their ceramics.

In some cultures, such as Cambodia, Chinese in Southeast Asia, northern Manchu tribes along Amur River, Sambians in Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Telugus of India, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, briefly taking the penis of a male infant or toddler into one&#x27;s mouth was considered a nonsexual form of affection or even a form of ritual, greeting, respect, parenting love, or lifesaving. According to some sources, it was an ancient Chinese custom for grandmothers, mothers, and elder sisters to calm their baby boys with fellatio. It has also been reported that some modern Chinese mothers have performed fellatio to their moribund sons as affection and means for lifesaving, because they culturally believe that when the penis is completely retracted into the abdomen, the boy or man will die.

==Other animals==
Flying foxes (a type of bat) have been observed engaging in oral sex. Indian flying fox males will lick a female&#x27;s vulva both before and after copulation, with the length of pre-copulation cunnilingus positively correlated with length of copulation. The fruit bat &quot;Cynopterus sphinx&quot;, has been observed to engage in fellatio during mating. Pairs spend more time copulating if the female licks the male than if she does not. Male Livingstone&#x27;s fruit bats have been observed engaging in homosexual fellatio, although it is unknown if this is an example of sexual behavior or social grooming. Bonin flying foxes also engage in homosexual fellatio, but the behavior has been observed independently of social grooming.

<text>A fatwa (; ; ; ) is a legal ruling on a point of Islamic law (sharia) given by a qualified Islamic jurist (&quot;faqih&quot;) in response to a question posed by a private individual, judge or government. A jurist issuing fatwas is called a &quot;mufti&quot;, and the act of issuing fatwas is called ifta&#x27;. Fatwas have played an important role throughout Islamic history, taking on new forms in the modern era.

Resembling &quot;jus respondendi&quot; in Roman law and rabbinic &quot;responsa&quot;, privately issued fatwas historically served to inform Muslim populations about Islam, advise courts on difficult points of Islamic law, and elaborate substantive law. In later times, public and political fatwas were issued to take a stand on doctrinal controversies, legitimize government policies or articulate grievances of the population. During the era of mass European/Christian invasions, fatwas played a part in mobilizing resistance against foreign aggressors.

Muftis acted as independent scholars in the classical legal system. Over the centuries, Sunni muftis were gradually incorporated into state bureaucracies, while Shia jurists in Iran asserted an autonomous authority starting from the early modern era.

In the modern era, fatwas have reflected changing economic, social and political circumstances, and addressed concerns arising in varied Muslim communities. The spread of codified state laws and Western-style legal education in the modern Muslim world has displaced muftis from their traditional role of clarifying and elaborating the laws applied in courts. Instead, modern fatwas have increasingly served to advise the general public on other aspects of sharia, particularly questions regarding religious rituals and everyday life. Modern public fatwas have addressed and sometimes sparked controversies in the Muslim world, and some fatwas in recent decades have gained worldwide notoriety. The legal methodology of modern &quot;ifta&quot; often diverges from pre-modern practice, particularly so in the West. Emergence of modern media and universal education has transformed the traditional institution of &quot;ifta&quot; in various ways. While the proliferation of contemporary fatwas attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims, little research has been done to determine how much these fatwas affect the beliefs or behavior of the Muslim public.

==Terminology==

The word &quot;fatwa&quot; comes from the Arabic root &quot;f-t-w&quot;, whose meanings include &#x27;youth, newness, clarification, explanation&#x27;. A number of terms related to &quot;fatwa&quot; derive from the same root. A jurist issuing fatwas is called a &quot;mufti&quot;. The person who asks for a fatwa is known as &quot;mustafti&quot;. The act of issuing fatwas is called &quot;iftāʾ&quot;. The term &quot;futyā&quot; refers to soliciting and issuing fatwas.

In older English language works the spelling fetva, from Turkish, is used, relating to the Ottoman Empire.

==Origins==

The origins of the &quot;fatwa&quot; can be traced back to the Quran. On a number of occasions, the Quranic text instructs the Islamic prophet Muhammad how to respond to questions from his followers regarding religious and social practices. Several of these verses begin with the phrase &quot;When they ask you concerning ..., say ...&quot; In two cases (4:127, 4:176) this is expressed with verbal forms of the root &quot;f-t-y&quot;, which signify asking for or giving an authoritative answer. In the hadith literature, this three-way relationship between God, Muhammad, and believers, is typically replaced by a two-way consultation, in which Muhammad replies directly to queries from his Companions (&quot;sahaba&quot;).

According to Islamic doctrine, with Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632, God ceased to communicate with mankind through revelation and prophets. At that point, the rapidly expanding Muslim community turned to Muhammad&#x27;s Companions, as the most authoritative voices among them, for religious guidance, and some of them are reported to have issued pronouncements on a wide range of subjects. The generation of Companions was in turn replaced in that role by the generation of Successors (&quot;tabi&#x27;un&quot;). The concept of fatwa thus developed in Islamic communities under a question-and-answer format for communicating religious knowledge, and took on its definitive form with development of the classical theory of Islamic law.

==In pre-modern Islam==

===Process of &quot;iftāʾ&quot;===

The legal theory of the fatwa was formulated in the classical texts of &quot;usul al-fiqh&quot; (principles of jurisprudence), while more practical guidelines for muftis were found in manuals called &quot;adab al-mufti&quot; or &quot;adab al-fatwa&quot; (etiquette of the mufti/fatwa).

Fatwas are issued in response to a query. They can range from a simple yes/no answer to a book-length treatise. A short fatwa may state a well-known point of law in response to a question from a lay person, while a &quot;major&quot; fatwa may give a judgment on an unprecedented case, detailing the legal reasoning behind the decision. Queries to muftis were supposed to address real and not hypothetical situations and be formulated in general terms, leaving out names of places and people. Since a mufti was not supposed to inquire into the situation beyond the information included in the query, queries regarding contentious matters were often carefully constructed to elicit the desired response. A mufti&#x27;s understanding of the query commonly depended on their familiarity with local customs and colloquialisms. In theory, if the query was unclear or not sufficiently detailed for a ruling, the mufti was supposed to state these caveats in their response.

Fatwas were solicited by men and women from all social classes. A mufti could be an obscure scholar, who occasionally replied to queries from people in his neighborhood, or, at the other extreme, a famous jurist or a powerful state official. The level of technical detail supplied in a fatwa, such as citations of sources or specification of legal methodologies employed, depended on the technical level of the petitioner. In theory, a petitioner was supposed to verify the mufti&#x27;s scholarly reputation, but mufti manuals (&quot;adab al-mufti&quot;) recognized that it would be difficult for a lay person to do so, and advised the petitioner to trust their sense of the mufti&#x27;s piety and ideally follow the advice of a single scholar known for exemplary morals. The mufti was often a well-known figure in his neighborhood. Some petitioners could choose among several local muftis, while others had to or chose to travel to receive a fatwa. Judges commonly sent letters to solicit fatwas from prominent jurists in another town or even country. Sunni legal theory generally permits the petioner to obtain a fatwa from multiple jurists on the same query, provided that it addresses a real and not hypothetical situation. Some petitioners sought out a second fatwa because they were unsatisfied with the first, and the two sides in a legal dispute generally each sought to obtain a fatwa that would support their position. Muftis often consulted another mufti on difficult cases, though this practice was not foreseen by legal theory, which saw &quot;futya&quot; as a transaction between one qualified jurist and one &quot;unqualified&quot; petitioner.

In theory, a mufti was expected to issue fatwas free of charge. In practice, muftis commonly received support from the public treasury, public endowments or private donations. Taking of bribes was forbidden. Until the 11th or 12th century, the vast majority of jurists held other jobs to support themselves. These were generally lower- and middle-class professions such as tanning, manuscript copying or small trade.

In theory, fatwas could be delivered orally or in writing, but it is not clear how common oral fatwas were, aside from those issued by an Ottoman office established specifically for the purpose of issuing oral fatwas. Many routine, written fatwas were delivered directly to the petitioner on the piece of paper containing the query, leaving no documentary trace. However, large collections of ordinary fatwas are preserved in Ottoman and Indian archives. Mufti manuals contained a number of regulations about the standard format of a fatwa, such as avoiding blank space that could be used for a spurious addition and concluding the fatwa with an expression like &quot;allahu a&#x27;lam&quot; (God knows best). Nonetheless, fatwas took on a variety of forms depending on the local legal culture.

The 14th century jurist Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyya was known for his methodology of issuing &quot;fatwas&quot; through direct research of the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot;, rather than being restrained by the mechanism of the &quot;madhhabs&quot; (legal schools). Explaining Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s approach to issue &quot;fatwas&quot;, his student Al-Dhahabi writes: &quot;He was well informed of the legal views of the [Prophet&#x27;s] companions and their followers, and he rarely talked about a subject without quoting the four schools of the imams. Yet, he contradicted the four schools in well-known matters about which he wrote and for which provided arguments from the Koran and the Sunna. He has compiled a work entitled &quot;Politics According to Divine Law for Establishing Order for Sovereign and Subjects&quot; and a book [called] &quot;Removing the Reproach from the Learned Imams&quot;... For some years now he has not issued &quot;fatwas&quot; (legal opinions) according to a specific school, rather he bases these on the proof he has ascertained himself. He supported the pure Sunna and the way of Salafiyah&quot;.

===Role of fatwas===

The classical institution of fatwa is similar to &quot;jus respondendi&quot; in Roman law and the &quot;responsa&quot; in Jewish law.

Fatwas have played three important roles in the classical legal system:
* managing information about Islam by providing legal advice to Muslim populations as well as counseling them in matters of ritual and ethics;
* advising courts of law on finer points of Islamic law, in response to queries from judges;
* elaborating substantive Islamic law, particularly though a genre of legal literature developed by author-jurists who collected fatwas of prominent muftis and integrated them into books.

Before the rise of modern education, the study of law was a centerpiece of advanced education in the Islamic world. A relatively small class of legal scholars controlled the interpretation of sharia on a wide range of questions essential to the society, ranging from ritual to finance. It was considered a requirement for qualified jurists to communicate their knowledge through teaching or issuing fatwas. The ideal mufti was conceived as an individual of scholarly accomplishments and exemplary morals, and muftis were generally approached with the respect and deference corresponding to these expectations.

Judges generally sought an opinion from a mufti with higher scholarly authority than themselves for difficult cases or potentially controversial verdicts. Fatwas were routinely upheld in courts, and if a fatwa was disregarded, it was usually because another fatwa supporting a different position was judged to be more convincing. If a party in a dispute was not able to obtain a fatwa supporting their position, they would be unlikely to pursue their case in court, opting for informal mediation instead, or abandoning their claim altogether. Sometimes muftis could be petitioned for a fatwa relating to a court judgment that has already been passed, acting as an informal appeals process, but the extent of this practice and its mechanism varied across history. While in most of the Islamic world judges were not required to consult muftis by any political authority, in Muslim Spain this practice was mandatory, so that a judicial decision was considered invalid without prior approval by a legal specialist.

Author-jurists collected fatwas by muftis of high scholarly reputation and abstracted them into concise formulations of legal norms that could be used by judges, giving a summary of jurisprudence for a particular &quot;madhhab&quot; (legal school). Author-jurists sought out fatwas that reflected the social conditions of their time and place, often opting for later legal opinions which were at variance with the doctrine of early authorities. Research by Wael Hallaq and Baber Johansen has shown that fatwa compilations could, and sometimes did, have a significant impact on the development of Islamic law.

During the early centuries of Islam, the roles of mufti, author-jurist and judge were not mutually exclusive. A jurist could lead a teaching circle, conduct a fatwa session, and adjudicate court cases in a single day, devoting his night hours to writing a legal treatise. Those who were able to act in all four capacities were regarded as the most accomplished jurists.

From the standpoint of morality and religious obligation, the term &quot;fatwa&quot; has been contrasted with &quot;taqwa&quot; (piety, fear of God), particularly in Sufi literature. Fatwas may allow a choice between lenient and strict interpretation of &quot;sharia&quot; on a certain matter, or they may employ legalistic stratagems (&quot;hiyal&quot;) to circumvent a stricter interpretation, while such strategies may not be acceptable from the standpoint of &quot;taqwa&quot;.

===Qualifications of a mufti===

The basic prerequisite for issuing fatwas under the classical legal theory was religious knowledge and piety. According to the &quot;adab al-mufti&quot; manuals, a mufti must be an adult, Muslim, trusted and reliable, of good character and sound mind, an alert and rigorous thinker, trained as a jurist, and not a sinner. On a practical level, the stature of muftis derived from their reputation for scholarly expertise and upright character.

According to legal theory, it was up to each mufti to decide when he was ready to practice. In practice, an aspiring jurist would normally study for several years with one or several recognized scholars, following a curriculum that included Arabic grammar, hadith, law and other religious sciences. The teacher would decide when the student was ready to issue fatwas by giving him a certificate (&quot;ijaza&quot;).

During the first centuries of Islam, it was assumed that a mufti was a &quot;mujtahid&quot;, i.e., a jurist who is capable of deriving legal rulings directly from the scriptural sources through independent reasoning (&quot;ijtihad&quot;), evaluating the reliability of hadith and applying or even developing the appropriate legal methodologies. Starting from around 1200 CE, legal theorists began to accept that muftis of their time may not possess the knowledge and legal skill to perform this activity. In addition, it was felt that the major question of jurisprudence had already been addressed by master jurists of earlier times, so that later muftis only had to follow the legal opinions established within their legal school (&quot;taqlid&quot;). At that point, the notions of &quot;mufti&quot; and &quot;mujtahid&quot; became distinguished, and legal theorists classified jurists into three or more levels of competence.

Among Twelver Shia, the Akhbari school of jurisprudence, which was predominant for a time during the early modern era, hold a different view on &quot;ifta&quot; from the currently predominant Usuli school. According to the Usulis, fatwas can be based on valid conjecture (&quot;zann&quot;) arrived through &quot;ijtihad&quot;, and every Muslim who is not qualified to be a &quot;mujtahid&quot; should become a follower (&quot;muqallid&quot;) of a &quot;mujtahid&quot;. In contrast, Akhbaris hold that all Shia Muslims must be &quot;muqallids&quot; of the Twelve Imams, and that fatwas should reflect only knowledge that is certain (&quot;qatʿ&quot;) and based on the traditions of the Imams.

Unlike the post of &quot;qadi&quot;, which is reserved for men in the classical sharia system, fatwas could be issued by qualified women as well as men. In practice, the vast majority of jurists who completed the lengthy curriculum in linguistic and religious sciences required to obtain the qualification to issue fatwas were men. Slaves and persons who were blind or mute were likewise theoretically barred from the post of a judge, but not that of mufti.

===Fatwa vs. court judgment===

The mufti and the judge play different roles in the classical sharia system, with corresponding differences between a fatwa and a &quot;qada&quot; (court decision):
* A fatwa is nonbinding (unless issued by a government judge in an Islamic state), while a court decision is binding and enforceable.
* A fatwa may deal with rituals, ethical questions, religious doctrines and sometimes even philosophical issues, while court cases dealt with legal matters in the narrow sense.
* The authority of a court judgment applies only to the specific court case, while a fatwa applies to all cases that fit the premises of the query.
* A fatwa is made on the basis of information provided in the request, while a judge actively investigates the facts of the case.
* A judge evaluates rival claims of two parties in a dispute in order to reach a verdict, while a fatwa is made on the basis of information provided by a single petitioner.
* Fatwas by prominent jurists were collected in books as sources of precedent, while court decisions were recorded in court registers, but not otherwise disseminated.
* While both muftis and judges were interpreters of sharia, judicial interpretation centered on evaluating evidence such as testimony and oath, while a mufti investigated textual sources of law (scripture and legal literature).
* In the classical legal system, judges were civil servants appointed by the ruler, while muftis were private scholars and not appointed officials.

===Institutions===

Before the 11th century CE, anyone who possessed scholarly recognition as an Islamic jurist could issue fatwas. Starting around that time, however, the public office of mufti began to appear alongside the private issuing of fatwas. In Khurasan, the rulers appointed a head of the local ulama, called &quot;shaykh al-Islam&quot;, who also functioned as the chief mufti. The Mamluks appointed four muftis, one for each of the four Sunni madhhabs, to appellate courts in provincial capitals. The Ottomans organized muftis into a hierarchical bureaucracy with a chief mufti of the empire called &quot;shaykh al-Islam&quot; at the top. The Ottoman &quot;shaykh al-Islam&quot; (Turk. &quot;şeyhülislam&quot;), was among the most powerful state officials. Scribes reviewed queries directed to Ottoman muftis and rewrote them to facilitate issuing of fatwas. In Mughal India and Safavid Iran the chief mufti had the title of &quot;sadr&quot;.

For the first few centuries of Islam, muftis were educated in informal study circles, but beginning in the 11th and 12th centuries, the ruling elites began to establish institutions of higher religious learning known as madrasas in an effort to secure support and cooperation of the &quot;ulema&quot; (religious scholars). Madrasas, which were primarily devoted to the study of law, soon multiplied throughout the Islamic world, helping to spread Islamic learning beyond urban centers and to unite diverse Islamic communities in a shared cultural project.

In some states, such as Muslim Spain, muftis were assigned to courts in advisory roles. In Muslim Spain jurists also sat on a &quot;shura&quot; (council) advising the ruler. Muftis were additionally appointed to other public functions, such as market inspectors.

==== In Shia Islam ====

While the office of the mufti was gradually subsumed into the state bureaucracy in much of the Sunni Muslim world, Shia religious establishment followed a different path in Iran starting from the early modern era. During Safavid rule, independent Islamic jurists (&quot;mujtahids&quot;) claimed the authority to represent the hidden imam. Under the Usuli doctrine that prevailed among Twelver Shias in the 18th century and under the Qajar dynasty, the &quot;mujtahids&quot; further claimed to act collectively as deputies of the imam. According to this doctrine, every Muslim is supposed to choose and follow a high-ranking living &quot;mujtahid&quot; bearing the title of &quot;marja&#x27; al-taqlid&quot;, whose fatwas are considered binding, unlike fatwas in Sunni Islam. Thus, in contrast to Sunni muftis, Shia &quot;mujtahids&quot; gradually achieved increasing independence from the state.

===Public and political fatwas===

While most fatwas were delivered to an individual or a judge, some fatwas that were public or political in nature played an important role in religious legitimation, doctrinal disputes, political criticism, or political mobilization. As muftis were progressively incorporated into government bureaucracies in the course of Islamic history, they were often expected to support government policies. Ottoman sultans regularly sought fatwas from the chief mufti for administrative and military initiatives, including fatwas sanctioning jihad against Mamluk Egypt and Safavid Iran. Fatwas by the Ottoman chief mufti were also solicited by the rulers to lend religious legitimacy to new social and economic practices, such as financial and penal laws enacted outside of sharia, printing of nonreligious books (1727) and vaccination (1845).

At other times muftis wielded their influence independently of the ruler, and several sultans in Morocco and the Ottoman Empire were dethroned as a result of fatwas issued by influential jurists. This happened, for example, to the Ottoman sultan Murad V on the grounds of his insanity. Public fatwas were also used to dispute doctrinal matters, and in some case to proclaim that certain groups or individuals who professed to be Muslim were to be excluded from the Islamic community (a practice known as &quot;takfir&quot;). In both political and scholarly sphere, doctrinal controversies between different states, denominations or centers of learning were accompanied by dueling fatwas. Muftis also acted to counteract the influence of judges and secular functionaries. By articulating grievances and legal rights of the population, public fatwas often prompted an otherwise unresponsive court system to provide redress.

==In the modern era==

===Anti-colonial fatwas===

Early in the era of Western colonialism, several fatwas were issued drawing on the classical legal distinction between lands under Islamic rule (&quot;dar al-Islam&quot;) and lands of war (&quot;dar al-harb&quot;) or unbelief (&quot;dar al-kufr&quot;). These fatwas classified countries under European domination as lands of war or unbelief and invoked the legal theory obliging Muslims to wage war against the rulers of these lands or emigrate. A number of such fatwas were issued during the 19th century, including in 1803 by Shah Abdul Aziz in India and in 1804 by Usman dan Fodio in West Africa. The unrealistic nature of these fatwas was soon recognized and in 1870 the &quot;ulama&quot; of northern India issued fatwas stating that Indian Muslims were not obliged to rebel or emigrate. A similar doctrinal controversy occurred in French-ruled Algeria. The fatwas solicited by the Algerian anti-colonial leader Abd al-Qadir differed in their technical detail, while the French authorities obtained fatwas from local muftis, stating that Muslims living under the rule of unbelievers were not obligated to fight or emigrate as long as they were granted religious freedom by the authorities.

On many other occasions, fatwas served as an effective tool for influencing the political process. For example, in 1904 a fatwa by Moroccan ulema achieved the dismissal of European experts hired by the Moroccan government, while in 1907 another Moroccan fatwa succeeded in deposing the sultan on accusation that he failed to mount a defense against French aggression. The 1891 tobacco protest fatwa by the Iranian &quot;mujtahid&quot; Mirza Shirazi, which prohibited smoking as long as the British tobacco monopoly was in effect, also achieved its goals.

===Modern institutions===

Under European colonial rule, the institution of &quot;dar al-ifta&quot; was established in a number of madrasas (law colleges) as a centralized place for issuing of fatwas, and these organizations to a considerable extent replaced independent muftis as religious guides for the general population. Following independence, most Muslim states established national organizations devoted to issuing fatwas. One example is the Egyptian Dar al-Ifta, founded in 1895, which has served to articulate a national vision of Islam through fatwas issued in response to government and private queries. National governments in Muslim-majority countries also instituted councils of senior religious scholars to advise the government on religious matters and issue fatwas. These councils generally form part of the ministry for religious affairs, rather than the justice department, which may have a more assertive attitude toward the executive branch.

While chief muftis of earlier times oversaw a hierarchy of muftis and judges applying traditional jurisprudence, most modern states have adopted European-influenced legal codes and no longer employ traditional judicial procedures or traditionally trained judges. State muftis generally promote a vision of Islam that is compatible with state law of their country.

Although some early theorists argued that muftis should not respond to questions on certain subjects, such as theology, muftis have in practice handled queries relating to a wide range of subjects. This trend continued in modern times, and contemporary state-appointed muftis and institutions for &quot;ifta&quot; respond to government and private queries on varied issues, including political conflicts, Islamic finance, and medical ethics, contributing to shaping a national Islamic identity.

There exists no international Islamic authority to settle differences in interpretation of Islamic law. An International Islamic Fiqh Academy was created by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, but its legal opinions are not binding.

===Legal methodology===

Modern fatwas have been marked by an increased reliance on the process of &quot;ijtihad&quot;, i.e. deriving legal rulings based on an independent analysis rather than conformity with the opinions of earlier legal authorities (&quot;taqlid&quot;). While in the past muftis were associated with a particular school of law (&quot;madhhab&quot;), in the 20th century many muftis began to assert their independence from traditional schools of jurisprudence.

The most notorious result of disregarding classical jurisprudence are the fatwas of militant extremists who have interpreted the Quran and hadith as supporting suicide bombings, indiscriminate killing of bystanders, and declaration of self-professed Muslims as unbelievers (&quot;takfir&quot;).

New forms of ijtihad have also given rise to fatwas that support such notions as gender equality and banking interest, which are at variance with classical jurisprudence. This is commonly accomplished by application of various traditional legal doctrines such as the &quot;maqasid&quot; (objectives) of sharia, &quot;maslaha&quot; (public interest) and &quot;darura&quot; (necessity), in place of adhering to the letter of scriptural sources. The main argument for this approach is that Islamic law is meant to serve the interest of Muslims and make their lives easier (&quot;taysīr&quot;). This form of ijtihad is particularly prominent in &quot;fiqh al-aqallīyāt&quot; (minority jurisprudence), a recently developed branch of Islamic jurisprudence that aims to address the needs of Muslims living in countries with a non-Muslim majority. Its opponents object that sharia is supposed to determine the interests of Muslims, and not the other way around.

===Political fatwas and controversies===

On November 14, 1914, the Ottoman sultan proclaimed a jihad to mark the official entry of the Ottoman Empire into World War I. The proclamation was supported by a fatwa issued by the Shaykh al-Islam. Contrary to the German hopes that the proclamation would trigger Muslim revolts in British and French colonies, it was either rejected or quietly ignored by their Muslim authorities. It also quickly gave rise to a heated academic debate in Europe. The controversy was sparked by a 1915 article by the prominent Dutch orientalist C. Snouck Hurgronje, titled &quot;Heilige Oorlog [Holy War] Made in Germany&quot;. In it Hurgronje denounced his German colleagues, who he felt instigated the jihad proclamation in an irresponsible appeal to an antiquated concept that threatened the project of modernizing the Muslim world. The article was widely circulated in an English translation and its accuracy continues to be debated by historians, who acknowledge both the German influence and the internal political calculations of the Ottoman government underlying the proclamation.

Several boycott fatwas were issued in modern times, such as the one issued by Iraqi ulema in 1933, calling on Muslims to boycott Zionist products. In 2004 Yusuf al-Qaradawi issued a fatwa calling for boycott of Israeli and American products, arguing that buying these goods would strengthen the &quot;enemy&quot; fighting against Muslims in the struggle over Palestine.

Some muftis in the modern era, like the mufti of the Lebanese republic in the mid-20th century and the Grand Mufti of the Sultanate of Oman, were important political leaders. In Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini used proclamations and fatwas to introduce and legitimize a number of institutions, including the Council of the Islamic Revolution and the Iranian Parliament.

Khomeini&#x27;s most publicized fatwa was the proclamation condemning Salman Rushdie to death for his novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;. Khomeini himself did not call this proclamation a fatwa, and some scholars have argued that it did not qualify as one, since in Islamic legal theory only a court can decide whether an accused is guilty. However, after the proclamation was presented as a fatwa in Western press, this characterization was widely accepted by both its critics and its supporters, and the Rushdie Affair is credited with bringing the institution of fatwa to world attention. Together with later militant fatwas, it has contributed to the popular misconception of the fatwa as a religious death warrant.

Many militant and reform movements in modern times have disseminated fatwas issued by individuals who do not possess the qualifications traditionally required of a mufti. A famous example is the fatwa issued in 1998 by Osama bin Laden and four of his associates, proclaiming &quot;jihad against Jews and Crusaders&quot; and calling for killing of American civilians. In addition to denouncing its content, many Islamic jurists stressed that bin Laden was not qualified to either issue a fatwa or declare a jihad.

The Amman Message was a statement, signed in 2005 in Jordan by nearly 200 prominent Islamic jurists, which served as a &quot;counter-fatwa&quot; against a widespread use of &quot;takfir&quot; (excommunication) by jihadist groups to justify jihad against rulers of Muslim-majority countries. The Amman Message recognized eight legitimate schools of Islamic law and prohibited declarations of apostasy against them. The statement also asserted that fatwas can be issued only by properly trained muftis, thereby seeking to delegitimize fatwas issued by militants who lack the requisite qualifications.

Erroneous and sometimes bizarre fatwas issued by unqualified or eccentric individuals in recent times have sometimes given rise to complaints about a &quot;chaos&quot; in the modern practice of &quot;ifta&quot;.

===Fatwas in the West===

In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, a group of Middle Eastern Islamic scholars issued a fatwa permitting Muslims serving in the U.S. army to participate in military action against Muslim countries, in response to a query from a U.S. Army Muslim chaplain. This fatwa illustrated two increasingly widespread practices. First, it drew directly on the Quran and hadith without referencing the body of jurisprudence from any of the traditional schools of Islamic law. Secondly, questions from Western Muslims directed to muftis in Muslim-majority countries have become increasingly common, as about one-third of Muslims now live in Muslim-minority countries.

Institutions devoted specifically to issuing fatwas to Western Muslims have been established in the West, including the Fiqh Council of North America (FCNA, founded in 1986) and the European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR, founded in 1997). These organizations aim to provide fatwas that address the concerns of Muslim minorities, helping them to comply with sharia, while stressing compatibility of Islam with diverse modern contexts. The FCNA was founded with the goal of developing legal methodologies for adopting Islamic law to life in the West. The ECRF draws on all major schools of Sunni law as well as other traditional legal principles, such as concern for the public good, local custom, and the prevention of harm, to derive fatwas suitable for life in Europe. For example, a 2001 ECRF ruling allowed a woman who had converted to Islam to remain married without requiring her husband&#x27;s conversion, based in part on the existence of European laws and customs under which women are guaranteed the freedom of religion. Rulings of this kind have been welcomed by some, but also criticized by others as being overly eclectic in legal methodology and having potential to negatively impact the interpretation of sharia in Muslim-majority countries.

The needs of Western Muslims have given rise to a new branch of Islamic jurisprudence which has been termed the jurisprudence of (Muslim) minorities (&quot;fiqh al-aqallīyāt&quot;). The term is believed to have been coined in a 1994 fatwa by Taha Jabir Alalwani, then the chairman of FCNA, which encouraged Muslim citizens to participate in American politics. This branch of jurisprudence has since been developed primarily, but not exclusively for Muslim minorities in the West.

===Role of modern media===

Advances in communication technology and the rise of the internet have changed the reception and role of fatwas in modern society. In the pre-modern era, most fatwas issued in response to private queries were read only by the petitioner. Early in the 20th century, the reformist Islamic scholar Rashid Rida responded to thousands of queries from around the Muslim world on a variety of social and political topics in the regular &quot;fatwa&quot; section of his Cairo-based journal &quot;Al-Manar&quot;. In the late 20th century, when the Grand Mufti of Egypt Sayyid Tantawy issued a fatwa allowing interest banking, the ruling was vigorously debated in the Egyptian press by both religious scholars and lay intellectuals.

In the internet age, a large number of websites has appeared offering fatwas to readers around the world. For example, IslamOnline publishes an archive of &quot;live fatwa&quot; sessions, whose number approached a thousand by 2007, along with biographies of the muftis. Together with satellite television programs, radio shows and fatwa hotlines offering call-in fatwas, these sites have contributed to the rise of new forms of contemporary &quot;ifta&quot;. Unlike the concise or technical pre-modern fatwas, fatwas delivered through modern mass media often seek to be more expansive and accessible to the wide public.

Modern media have also facilitated cooperative forms to &quot;ifta&quot;. Networks of muftis are commonly engaged by fatwa websites, so that queries are distributed among the muftis in the network, who still act as individual jurisconsults. In other cases, Islamic jurists of different nationalities, schools of law, and sometimes even denominations (Sunni and Shia), coordinate to issue a joint fatwa, which is expected to command greater authority with the public than individual fatwas. The collective fatwa (sometimes called &quot;ijtihād jamāʿī&quot;, &quot;collective legal interpretation&quot;) is a new historical development, and it is found in such settings as boards of Islamic financial institutions and international fatwa councils.

===Social role of fatwas===

As the role of fatwas on strictly legal issues has declined in modern times, there has been a relative increase in the proportion of fatwas dealing with rituals and further expansion in purely religious areas like Quranic exegesis, creed, and Sufism. Modern fatwas also deal with a wide variety of other topics, including insurance, sex-change operations, moon exploration, beer drinking, abortion in the case of fatal foetal abnormalities, or males and females sharing workplaces. Public &quot;fatwa wars&quot; have reflected political controversies in the Muslim world, from anti-colonial struggles to the Gulf War of the 1990s, when muftis in some countries issued fatwas supporting collaboration with the US-led coalition, while muftis from other countries endorsed the Iraqi call for jihad against the US and its collaborators. In the private sphere, some muftis have begun to resemble social workers, giving advice on various personal issues encountered in everyday life.

The social profile of the fatwa petitioner has also undergone considerable changes. Owing to the rise of universal education, those who solicit fatwas have become increasingly educated, which has transformed the traditional mufti–mustafti relationship based on restricted literacy. The questioner is now also increasingly likely to be female, and in the modern world Muslim women tend to address muftis directly rather than conveying their query through a male relative as in the past. Since women now represent a significant proportion of students studying Islamic law and qualifying as muftiyas, their prominence in its interpretation is likely to rise. A fatwa hotline in the United Arab Emirates provides access to either male or female muftis, allowing women to request fatwas from female Islamic legal scholars.

The vast amount of fatwas produced in the modern world attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims. However, there is little research available to indicate to what extent Muslims acknowledge the authority of various fatwas and heed their rulings in real life. Rather than reflecting the actual conduct or opinions of Muslims, these fatwas may instead represent a collection of opinions on what Muslims &quot;ought to think&quot;.

<text>&quot;Relax&quot; is the debut single by English new wave band Frankie Goes to Hollywood, released in the United Kingdom by ZTT Records in 1983.

The hit version, produced by Trevor Horn and featuring the band along with other musicians, entered the UK Top 75 singles chart in November 1983 but did not crack the Top 40 until early January 1984. Three weeks later it reached number one, on the chart dated 28 January 1984, replacing Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Pipes of Peace&quot;. One of the decade&#x27;s most controversial and most commercially successful records, &quot;Relax&quot; eventually sold a reported two million copies in the UK alone, easily ranking among the ten biggest-selling singles in the UK. It remained in the UK Top 40 for 37 consecutive weeks, 35 of which overlapped with a radio airplay ban by the BBC (owing to lyrics perceived as overtly sexual).

In June 1984, bolstered by the instant massive success of the band&#x27;s follow-up single &quot;Two Tribes&quot;, the single re-entered the Top Ten for a further nine weeks, including two spent at no. 2 (behind &quot;Two Tribes&quot;). At that time, Frankie Goes to Hollywood were the only act apart from the Beatles and John Lennon to concurrently occupy the top two positions on the chart. Several 12-inch single versions (and the &quot;Frankie Say Relax&quot; T-shirt craze) further fed the &quot;Relax&quot; phenomenon. The single re-entered the UK Top 75 in February 1985 and, more successfully, in October 1993, when it spent three weeks in the Top Ten. &quot;Relax&quot; remains the UK&#x27;s biggest-selling debut single of all time. 

In the United States &quot;Relax&quot; was also comparatively slow in reaching its chart peak. Released in March 1984, albeit with a different mix and nearly a minute shorter in length, the single stalled at no. 67 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 in May during a seven-week run, but it ranked number one for the year on the Los Angeles &quot;alternative rock&quot; station KROQ, as voted for by listeners. In January 1985 a release of &quot;Relax&quot; that was far more similar to the UK hit version entered the Hot 100 at no. 70, and in March it reached no. 10 during its 16-week run. In January 1989 the single was certified gold by the RIAA.

In February 1985 the record was awarded Best British Single of 1984 at the Brit Awards, and Frankie Goes to Hollywood won Best British Newcomer. A version of the song features on Frankie Goes to Hollywood&#x27;s debut album &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot;, released in October 1984.

==Background and recording==

Singer Holly Johnson said the lyrics came to him as he was walking down Princess Avenue in Liverpool: &quot;I mean they were just, you know, words that floated into my head one day when I was walking down Princess Avenue with no bus fare, trying to get to rehearsals – I mean there was no great sort of calculated, &#x27;Oh I&#x27;ll sing these words and this record&#x27;ll be banned&#x27;.&quot;

ZTT Records signed Frankie Goes to Hollywood after producer-turned-ZTT cofounder Trevor Horn saw the band play on the television show &quot;The Tube&quot;, on which the group played an early version of &quot;Relax&quot;. Horn described the original version of &quot;Relax&quot; as &quot;more a jingle than a song&quot;, but he preferred to work with songs that were not professionally finished because he could then &quot;fix them up&quot; in his own style. Once the band was signed, ZTT co-founder Paul Morley mapped out the marketing campaign fashioned as a &quot;strategic assault on pop&quot;. Morley opted to tackle the biggest possible themes in the band&#x27;s singles (&quot;sex, war, religion&quot;), of which &quot;Relax&quot; would be the first, and emphasized the shock impact of Frankie members Holly Johnson&#x27;s and Paul Rutherford&#x27;s open homosexuality in the packaging and music videos.

Horn dominated the recording of &quot;Relax&quot; in his effort for perfectionism. Initial sessions were held at the Manor Studio. The band were overawed and intimidated by Horn&#x27;s reputation, and thus were too nervous to make suggestions. Johnson said in his autobiography, &quot;Whatever he said we went along with&quot;. When attempts to record with the full band proved unsatisfactory, Horn hired former Ian Dury backing band the Blockheads for the sessions, with Norman Watt-Roy providing the original bass line. Those sessions were later deemed to be not modern-sounding enough. Instead, Watt-Roy&#x27;s playing was replaced by a sampled E note on a bass guitar, which was layered over a Linn 2 bass drum.

Horn then constructed a more electronic-based version of the song with keyboards by session musician Andy Richards and with rhythm programming assistance from J. J. Jeczalik of Art of Noise. Horn developed this version of the recording in his west London studio while the band remained in their hometown of Liverpool. Horn had made three versions of &quot;Relax&quot; prior to Richards and guitarist Stephen Lipson joining his ZTT Production &#x27;Theam&#x27; in late 1983. Horn left the studio late one night asking for Lipson to erase the multitrack (of version 3) due to lack of progress, but came back into the studio some time later to hear Richards playing a variety of modal chords based around the key of E minor with Lipson playing guitar along to the unerased multitrack.

Ultimately, vocalists Johnson and Rutherford were the only band members to perform on the record. The only contribution by the other members was a sample crafted from the sound of the rest of the band jumping into a swimming pool. Johnson later said that &quot;Trevor didn&#x27;t like the band&#x27;s standard of playing as he couldn&#x27;t sync it to his machinery&quot;. Horn later recalled of the song&#x27;s intro, &quot;Hit singles are not just good songs. They need to be moments. Holly had been blowing his saxophone on the studio roof in Notting Hill at 2am, and a bunch of guys appeared on the street, calling up to him. He came down to do the vocal, and I suggested he play it at the start of Relax.&quot;

In a 2021 interview, Horn said that &quot;the band we signed weren&#x27;t quite the band who had appeared on the original demo, though we didn&#x27;t know that at the time&quot;. The demo had featured Jed O&#x27;Toole, brother of bassist Mark O&#x27;Toole, on guitar, who subsequently left to pursue a 9-to-5 career. He was replaced by Brian Nash, who was a guitar novice at the time the single was recorded, though Horn acknowledged that he developed into a good guitarist by the time &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; was finished. Horn completed the recording having spent £70,000 in studio time.

==Release, controversy and ban by the BBC==
Morley intentionally courted scandal with the promotion of &quot;Relax&quot;. ZTT initiated the ad campaign for &quot;Relax&quot; with two quarter-page ads in the British music press. The first ad featured images of Rutherford in a sailor cap and a leather vest, and Johnson with a shaved head and rubber gloves. The images were accompanied by the phrase &quot;ALL THE NICE BOYS LOVE SEA MEN&quot;, a pun on the music hall song &quot;Ship Ahoy! (All the Nice Girls Love a Sailor)&quot;. It declared &quot;Frankie Goes to Hollywood are coming ... making Duran Duran lick the shit off their shoes ... Nineteen inches that must be taken always.&quot; The second ad promised &quot;theories of bliss, a history of Liverpool from 1963 to 1983, a guide to Amsterdam bars&quot;.

When the single was first released in November 1983, the initial progress of &quot;Relax&quot; on the UK Top 75 was sluggish. First charting at no. 67, it had progressed only to no. 35 by its seventh week on the chart, even having fallen back slightly during that time. But then on Thursday 5 January 1984, Frankie Goes to Hollywood were shown performing &quot;Relax&quot; on the BBC flagship television chart show, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The following week it soared to no. 6. On 11 January 1984, Radio 1 disc jockey Mike Read expressed on air his distaste for both the record&#x27;s suggestive sleeve (designed by Anne Yvonne Gilbert) and its lyric, which centred on the oft-repeated &quot;Relax, don&#x27;t do it/When you want to sock it to it/Relax, don&#x27;t do it/ When you want to come.&quot; He announced his refusal to play the record, not knowing the BBC had just decided the song was not to be played on the BBC anyway. Holly Johnson admitted that while the label claimed the lyric was &quot;When you want to sock it to it&quot;, he was actually singing &quot;When you want to suck it, chew it&quot;.

In support of their disc jockey, BBC Radio banned the single from its shows a reported two days later (although certain prominent night-time BBC shows – including those of Kid Jensen and John Peel – continued to play the record, as they saw fit, during 1984). The now-banned &quot;Relax&quot; rose to no. 2 on the charts by 17 January, and hit the number-one spot on 24 January. By this time, the BBC Radio ban had extended to &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; as well, which simply displayed a still picture of the group during its climactic number one announcement, before airing a performance by a non-number one artist.

This went on for the five weeks that &quot;Relax&quot; was at number one. It then began a slow decline on the charts, falling back as far as no. 31 in May 1984 before returning to no. 2 in July whilst Frankie&#x27;s follow-up single &quot;Two Tribes&quot; held the UK number-one spot. In the end, &quot;Relax&quot; remained in the Top 75 for 48 consecutive weeks and returned in February 1985 for four more, giving a total of 52.

The ban became an embarrassment for the BBC, especially given that UK commercial radio and television stations were still playing the song. Later in 1984 the ban was lifted and &quot;Relax&quot; featured on both the Christmas Day edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and Radio 1&#x27;s rundown of the best-selling singles of the year.

Throughout the &quot;Relax&quot; controversy, the band continued to publicly deny that the song&#x27;s lyrics were sexual. Nevertheless, by late 1984, it was clear that the public were aware of the sexual nature of the lyrics, but the scandal had fuelled sales anyway. In 1985, with the release of the &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; album (which included &quot;Relax&quot;), the band dropped any public pretence about the lyrics: 
The track was reissued in September 1993, the first of a string of Frankie Goes to Hollywood singles to be reissued that year. It debuted at a high no. 6 on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at no. 5 the following week. It spent seven weeks in the Top 75 this time, thus extending its combined total to 59, making it at the time the third longest runner of all time; it has since been surpassed by 44 other songs and sits in joint 47th place.

==Critical reception==
American magazine &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that the song is &quot;a very danceable cut&quot;, in which &quot;heavy bass and bass drum provide the backdrop for Frankie&#x27;s pleading lyric and Frank Sinatraesque soaring vocal.&quot; Alan Jones from &quot;Music Week&quot; gave the 1993 remix four out of five, writing, &quot;ZTT recently got its catalogue back from Island, and is about to embark on a high profile re-issue/remix campaign, of which this is the first fruit. &quot;Relax&quot; is updated by Ollie J in a stomping house mix, while Jam &amp; Spoon&#x27;s pumped-up Hi-NRG version is hardcore tempo. With the original mixes added to the package, this is going to be big all over again. But will One FM play it?&quot; Richard Harris from &quot;NME&quot; commented, &quot;&#x27;Relax&#x27; sounds as divine as ever; a perfect soundtrack for pubescents to discover the delightful realities of having hormones.&quot;

==Original 1983–1984 mixes==

Although the 7-inch version of the single remained unchanged throughout its initial release (a mix generally known as &quot;Relax (Move)&quot;), promotional 7-inch records featuring a substantially different mix of &quot;Relax&quot; (entitled either &quot;The Last Seven Inches&quot; or &quot;Warp Mix&quot; because it is a compilation of other versions) were the subject of a limited 1984 release.

Three principal 12-inch remixes of &quot;Relax&quot; were eventually created by producer Trevor Horn:

One of the reasons we did all the remixes was that the initial 12-inch version of &#x27;Relax&#x27; contained something called &#x27;The Sex Mix&#x27;, which was 16 minutes long and didn&#x27;t even contain a song. It was really Holly Johnson just jamming, as well as a bunch of samples of the group jumping in the swimming pool and me sort of making disgusting noises by dropping stuff into buckets of water! We got so many complaints about it — particularly from gay clubs, who found it offensive — that we cut it in half and reduced it down to eight minutes, by taking out some of the slightly more offensive parts [this became &quot;Sex Mix (Edition 2)&quot;]. Then we got another load of complaints, because the single version wasn&#x27;t on the 12-inch — I didn&#x27;t see the point in this at the time, but I was eventually put straight about it.

Horn attested that visits to New York&#x27;s Paradise Garage club led to the creation of the final &quot;Relax (New York Mix)&quot;, which ultimately replaced the original &quot;Sex Mix&quot; releases:

It was only when I went to this club and heard the sort of things they were playing that I really understood about 12-inch remixes. Although I myself had already had a couple of big 12-inch hits, I&#x27;d never heard them being played on a big sound system, and so I then went back and mixed &#x27;Relax&#x27; again and that was the version which sold a couple of million over here [in the UK].
The original 12-inch version of &quot;Relax&quot;, labelled &quot;Sex Mix&quot;, ran for over 16 minutes, and is broadly as described by Horn above. The subsequent &quot;Edition 2&quot; was an 8-minute-plus edit of the &quot;Sex Mix&quot;, and can only be distinguished by having &quot;12ISZTAS1&quot; etched on the vinyl. The final 12-inch mix, containing no elements from the foregoing versions, was designated the &quot;New York Mix&quot;, and ran for approximately 7:20. This was the most commonly available 12-inch version of &quot;Relax&quot; during its worldwide 1984 chart success.

The UK cassette single featured &quot;Greatest Bits&quot;, a unique amalgam of excerpts from the &quot;Sex Mix&quot;, &quot;New York Mix&quot;, &quot;Move&quot; and an instrumental version of &quot;Move&quot;.

Since virtually all of the UK &quot;Relax&quot; 12-inch singles were labelled &quot;Sex Mix&quot;, a method of differentiating between versions by reference to the record&#x27;s matrix numbers necessarily became &quot;de rigueur&quot; for collectors of Frankie Goes to Hollywood releases (and ultimately collectors of ZTT records in general).

&quot;Relax (Come Fighting)&quot; was the version of the song included on the &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; album. This is ostensibly a variant of the 7-inch single &quot;Move&quot; mix, but is different from that version. For example, the 7&quot; mix fades in on a foghorn type sound while the album mix fades in on sustained synth chords. Also, the backing vocals of the 7&quot; mix are panned to the left, whereas they are mixed in the centre on the album version. Additionally, the 7&quot; mix features a prominent reverberated kick drum sound during the introduction that also appears in other parts of the song, which is completely absent from the album mix. The album mix also has a certain post-production sheen (greater stereo separation of parts, more strategic uses of reverb, etc.) that is absent from the original 1983 7-inch single mix. The &quot;Classic 1993 Version&quot; is a version of the original 7&quot; mix that uses &quot;Bonus, Again&quot; as the instrumental track, although modification with elements from &quot;Come Fighting&quot; thrown in (e.g. both the intro and outro come directly from it) and much of it made to sound more clear.

The original airing of Relax on &quot;The Tube&quot;, before the band were signed to ZTT, featured another verse that was edited from all the released versions, &quot;In heaven everything is fine, you&#x27;ve got yours and I&#x27;ve got mine&quot;, presumably removed as it was taken directly from the David Lynch film &quot;Eraserhead&quot;.

According to a fan enquiry by a member of the Alternate forum (a forum dedicated to ZTT) to Holly Johnson over accusation that &quot;Edition 2&quot; was created by a DJ, &quot;Edition 2&quot; was edited by Trevor Horn at the Sarm East studio with J. J. Jeczalik engineering and Johnson watching.

==B-sides==
The 7-inch featured &quot;One September Monday&quot;, an interview between ZTT&#x27;s Paul Morley, Holly Johnson and Paul Rutherford. During the interview, Holly revealed that the group&#x27;s name derived from a page of the &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine, headlined &quot;Frankie Goes Hollywood&quot; and featuring Frank Sinatra &quot;getting mobbed by teenyboppers&quot;.

On all of the original 12-inch releases, the B-side featured a cover of &quot;Ferry &#x27;Cross the Mersey&quot;, followed by a brief dialogue involving Rutherford attempting to sign on, and an a cappella version of the title track&#x27;s chorus, segueing into an instrumental version of &quot;Relax&quot;, known as &quot;Bonus, Again&quot; (which resembles &quot;Come Fighting&quot; more than the 7&quot; mix).

The UK cassette single included &quot;Ferry &#x27;Cross the Mersey&quot; and interview sections not included on &quot;One September Monday&quot;.

==Videos==
The first official music video for &quot;Relax&quot;, directed by Bernard Rose and set in an S&amp;M themed gay nightclub at Wilton&#x27;s music hall in London it featuring the bandmembers accosted by buff leathermen, a glamorous drag queen, and an obese admirer dressed up as a Roman emperor, played by actor John Dair, was allegedly banned by MTV and the BBC, prompting the recording of a second video, directed by Godley and Creme in early 1984, featuring the group performing with the help of laser beams. However, after the second video was made the song was banned completely by the BBC, meaning that neither video was ever broadcast on any BBC music programmes.

A live performance video of the song was directed by David Mallet, making the rounds at MTV. The live version was released as the B-side of the US 12&quot; version of &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot;, titled &quot;Relax (International)&quot;.

Another MTV video of the studio version includes footage from the Brian De Palma film &quot;Body Double&quot;. &quot;Body Double&quot;, a popular 1984 erotic thriller film, contains a film within a film sequence in which Frankie Goes to Hollywood performs &quot;Relax&quot; on the set of a porn film.

==&quot;Zoolander&quot; versions==
&quot;Relax&quot; is a major plot point in the film &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001), where the titular character is conditioned to assassinate a target when he hears the song. Limp Bizkit also recorded their own version for the film, though Powerman 5000&#x27;s cover was used instead, in both the film and on the soundtrack. &quot;Relax&quot; was also used for the trailer of &quot;Zoolander 2&quot; (2016).

<doc id="11261" wikidata="Q1549629" url="?curid=11261" title="Two Tribes">
<text>&quot;Two Tribes&quot; is an anti-war song by British band Frankie Goes to Hollywood, released in the UK by ZTT Records on 4 June 1984. The song was later included on the album &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot;. Presenting a nihilistic, gleeful lyric expressing enthusiasm for nuclear war, it juxtaposes a relentless pounding bass line and guitar riff inspired by American funk and R&amp;B pop with influences of Russian classical music, in an opulent arrangement produced by Trevor Horn.

The single was a phenomenal success in the UK, helped by a wide range of remixes and supported by an advertising campaign depicting the band as members of the Red Army. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number one on 10 June 1984, where it stayed for nine consecutive weeks, during which time the group&#x27;s previous single &quot;Relax&quot; climbed back up the charts to number two. It was the longest-running number-one single in the UK of the 1980s. It has sold 1.58 million copies in the UK as of November 2012, being in the Top 30 best-selling singles in the UK as of 2022.

Songwriters Johnson, Gill and O&#x27;Toole received the 1984 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. In 2015 the song was voted by the British public as the nation&#x27;s 14th-favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV.

==Music==
A version of &quot;Two Tribes&quot; was originally recorded for a BBC John Peel session in October 1982. The session version makes clear that the basic structure of the song, including its signature bass-line, percussion arrangement and idiosyncratic introductory and middle eight sections, were already intact prior to any involvement from ZTT or eventual producer Trevor Horn.

Johnson also noted: &quot;There&#x27;s two elements in the music – an American funk line and a Russian line. It&#x27;s the most obvious demonstration of two tribes that we have today.&quot; To accentuate the musical tension, Horn arranged the &#x27;Russian&#x27; segments as a dramatic string arrangement. The driving funk/rock rhythm section was played on synthesisers.

==Title and lyrics==
The single was released at a time when the Cold War had intensified and fears about global nuclear warfare were at a peak. Although Johnson would attest in a 1984 radio interview that the &quot;two tribes&quot; of the song potentially represented any pair of warring adversaries (giving the examples of &quot;cowboys and Indians or Captain Kirk and Klingons&quot;), the line &quot;On the air America/I modelled shirts by Van Heusen&quot; is a clear reference to then US President Ronald Reagan. Reagan had advertised for Phillips Van Heusen in 1953 (briefly reviving the association in the early 1980s). The title of his first film had been &quot;Love Is on the Air&quot;.

The lyric &quot;working for the black gas&quot; is, according to Johnson, &quot;About oil surpassing gold. How you might as well be paid in petrol.&quot; And the line &quot;Are we living in a land where sex and horror are the new gods?&quot; was inspired by the 1959 British film &quot;Cover Girl Killer&quot;. Johnson explained, &quot;The TV was on in the background while I was doing me ironing and suddenly this character came out with that statement.&quot; (The actual dialogue, which occurs at about 48 minutes 24 seconds into the film, is &quot;Surely sex and horror are the new gods in this polluted world of so-called entertainment?&quot;)

The track featured snippets of narration from actor Patrick Allen, recreating his narration from the British &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; public information films about how to survive a nuclear war. (The original &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; soundtracks were sampled for the 7-inch mixes.)

The 12-inch A- and B-sides featured voice parts by British actor Chris Barrie imitating Ronald Reagan. Barrie also voiced the Reagan puppet on &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. Barrie&#x27;s parts as &#x27;Reagan&#x27; included praise for the band, as well as parts of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s speech to a court after the Beer Hall Putsch: &quot;You may pronounce us guilty a thousand times over, but the Goddess of the Eternal Court of History will smile and tear to tatters the brief of the State Prosecutor and the sentence of this court, for She acquits us.&quot; Barrie also voiced the last sentence of &quot;History Will Absolve Me&quot; (Spanish: &quot;La historia me absolverá&quot;) which is the concluding sentence and subsequent title of a four-hour speech made by Fidel Castro on 16 October 1953. Castro made the speech in his own defense in court against the charges brought against him after leading an attack on the Moncada Barracks on 26 July 1953. Barrie would return for the band&#x27;s next single, &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, imitating Mike Read in a parody of the DJ&#x27;s ban on their previous single, &quot;Relax&quot;.

The song&#x27;s title derives from the line &quot;two mighty warrior tribes went to war&quot; from the film &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (the line is also spoken by Holly Johnson at the beginning of the session version).

==Critical reception==
American magazine &quot;Cash Box&quot; called it &quot;a more scintillating anti-war track than [&quot;The War Song&quot;]&quot;, saying it is &quot;both an effective dance cut and a piece of modern art.&quot; Richard Harris from &quot;NME&quot; wrote, Two Tribes&#x27; is a fine example of why over-production is a musical virtue, not least when it ceases to be a pop song and tries to disco-ise Tchaikovsky.&quot;

==Promotion==
ZTT aggressively marketed the single in terms of its topical political angle, promoting it with images of the group wearing American military garb in combat, as well as Soviet-style army uniforms set against an American urban backdrop.

The original cover art featured a Soviet mural of Vladimir Lenin in St Petersburg, and images of Reagan and then-UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The sleeve notes, attributed to ZTT&#x27;s Paul Morley, dispassionately reported details of the relative nuclear arsenals of each superpower.

==Original 1984 mixes==
The song appeared in the form of six mixes, including &quot;Annihilation&quot;, &quot;Carnage&quot;, &quot;Hibakusha&quot;, &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot;, &quot;We Don&#x27;t Want to Die&quot; and &quot;For the Victims of Ravishment&quot;.

The first 12-inch mix (&quot;Annihilation&quot;) started with an air-raid siren, and included advice from Allen about how to tag and dispose of family members should they die in the fallout shelter (taken from the public information film &quot;Casualties&quot;). This version appeared on CD editions of the album. &quot;Annihilation&quot; was the basis for the &quot;Hibakusha&quot; mix, which was originally released in a limited edition, Japanese-only version of the 1985 album &quot;Bang!&quot;. Hibakusha is the Japanese word for survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

&quot;For the Victims of Ravishment&quot; appeared on the LP and cassette editions of the album &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot;. It is the shortest version, at 3:27 minutes. This mix derived from the &quot;Carnage&quot; mix, which prominently featured strings as well as vocal samples from Allen and the group&#x27;s B-side interview.

Since 1984, &quot;Two Tribes&quot; has been re-issued several times, generally involving third-party remixes bearing little relation to the original releases in terms of either structure or character.

==B-sides==
The 7-inch featured &quot;One February Friday&quot;, an interview between Morley and the group&#x27;s three musicians, Mark O&#x27;Toole, Brian Nash and Peter Gill, over an otherwise untitled instrumental track. A similar track had been included on the B-side of &quot;Relax&quot;, with the title &quot;One September Monday&quot;.

The principal B-side to the original 12-inch single was a cover version of &quot;War&quot;, which became the subject of an extended remix (subtitled &quot;Hidden&quot;) on the single&#x27;s third UK 12-inch release, where it was promoted as a double A-side with &quot;Carnage&quot;.

The UK cassette single featured a cut-together combination of &quot;Surrender&quot;, &quot;Carnage&quot; and &quot;Annihilation&quot;, plus Reagan snippets and interview sections not included on any other release.

==Videos==
The Godley &amp; Creme-directed video depicted a wrestling match between then-US President Ronald Reagan and Konstantin Chernenko, then Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in front of group members and an assembly of representatives from the world&#x27;s nations. The match eventually degenerates into global destruction. Certain violent moments (&quot;Reagan&quot; is seen, for example, biting &quot;Chernenko&#x27;s&quot; ear) were edited from the version shown on MTV.

A longer version of the video (based on the &quot;Hibakusha&quot; mix) included an introductory, heavily edited monologue by Richard Nixon taken from an ad from his 1960 US Presidential campaign (&quot;No ... firm diplomacy ... No ... peace for America and the world&quot;), plus similar contributions from other world leaders, including Lord Beaverbrook, Yasser Arafat and John F. Kennedy. The complete soundtrack to the extended video was eventually released as &quot;Two Tribes (Video Destructo)&quot; on the German version of the &quot;Twelve Inches&quot; compilation. A third version of the video, included on the band&#x27;s &quot;From An Wasteland to an Artificial Paradise&quot; VHS, retains the introduction, but omits most of the inserted clips in the main wrestling sequence.

7&quot;: ZTT / ZTAS 3 United Kingdom:
The A-side mix is commonly referred as &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot; to avoid confusion with other mixes, as ZTT commonly gives the sides on singles separate names. Thus, &quot;One February Friday&quot; is sometimes subtitled as either &quot;Doctors and Nurses&quot; (as per the regular 7&quot;) or &quot;Only Bullets Can Stop Them Now&quot; (as per the picture disc B-side label).

7&quot; (picture disc): ZTT / P ZTAS 3 United Kingdom:

The A-side is an alternative mix to the regular 7&quot; (subtitled &quot;We Don&#x27;t Want To Die&quot; on the B-side label). A common theory within many fans is that &quot;We Don&#x27;t Want To Die&quot; is essentially &quot;Surrender&quot; with vocals.

Also issued as a regular 7&quot; in Canada.

<text>&quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; is the title track to the 1984 debut album by English pop band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. The lyrics of the song were inspired by the poem &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

In March 1985, the album track was abridged and remixed for release as the group&#x27;s fourth UK single.

While criticised at the time of release and afterward for being a song that glorifies debauchery, the lyrics (and video), just as Coleridge&#x27;s poem, were about the &quot;dangers&quot; of mindless indulgence. This song, along with &quot;Relax&quot;, made Frankie Goes to Hollywood even more controversial than they already were.

&quot;Billboard&quot; compared it to &quot;Relax&quot;, saying that &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; had &quot;less hook, less controversy, more drama.&quot;

==Original 1985 single==

Despite the group&#x27;s record label (ZTT) pre-emptively promoting the single as &quot;their fourth number one&quot;, an achievement that would have set a new UK record for consecutive number one singles by a debuting artist, &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, being kept off the top spot by the Phil Collins/Philip Bailey duet &quot;Easy Lover&quot;. The single spent a total of eleven weeks on the UK chart.

It was the first release by the group not to reach number one and, despite representing a creditable success in its own right, it symbolically confirmed the end of the chart invincibility that the group had enjoyed during 1984. Frankie Goes to Hollywood would not release another record for seventeen months, and they would fail to emulate their past chart success upon their return.

The spoken-word introductions to both 12-inch mixes are adapted from Walter Kaufmann&#x27;s 1967 translation of Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;. The recitation on the first 12-inch/cassette single (&quot;Real Altered&quot;) is by Gary Taylor, whilst that on the second 12-inch (&quot;Fruitness&quot;) is by actor Geoffrey Palmer. It is unknown whether Palmer&#x27;s concluding &quot;Welcome to the Pleasured&quot;r&quot;ome&quot; was a genuine mistake or a deliberately scripted one.

This is the only single from the group that was not released on a CD single at that time. &quot;Relax&quot;, &quot;Two Tribes&quot;, &quot;The Power of Love&quot; and &quot;Rage Hard+&quot; all saw a CD-maxi release in Germany at the end of the &#x27;80s. &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; was not given such a release. However, the 7-inch vinyl single was released in two different mixes, and it was purely random as to which one you ended up with, as both mixes were in identical sleeve designs and carried the same catalogue number. Not only that, but the subtitle used to identify different mixes was identical on both record labels, with only the matrix number on the run out groove giving the game away. The first 7-inch (matrix 7 A 1 U) carried the normal 7-inch single mix, which was guitar driven. However, the &quot;secret&quot; alternative mix (matrix 7 A 7 U or 7 A 8 U) was quite different, and featured on the apple-shaped picture disc. The subtitle for that disc was &#x27;alternative reel&#x27; but on the 7-inch single the subtitle remained unchanged as &#x27;altered real&#x27;.

==B-sides==
All releases featured an edited version of &quot;Get It On&quot;, originally recorded for a BBC Radio 1 session in 1983 (a full-length version was included on the cassette release), plus a faded or full length version of &quot;Happy Hi!&quot;, a non-album track.

Both &quot;Relax (International)&quot; and &quot;Born to Run&quot; are live recordings (with some minor overdubs), based on an actual live appearance on &quot;The Tube&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Europe A-Go-Go&quot; in Newcastle during early January 1985.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; was directed by Bernard Rose. It features the group stealing a car whilst Holly is flying in a helicopter chasing them, going to a carnival and encountering all manner of deceptively &quot;pleasureable&quot; activities. The audio soundtrack of the video was included as part of the cassette single.

Three edits were made, the regular 4:55 version with the regular 7-inch mix, a 5:45 version matching what was included on the cassette single and a 7:52 version with a longer, different intro.

==Promotional releases==
In 1984, a few months prior to the album&#x27;s release, an early instrumental version of the album track was issued as a promotional 12-inch single, entitled &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome (Pleasure Fix)&quot;, along with a similar early instrumental of &quot;The Only Star in Heaven&quot; (subtitled &quot;Star Fix&quot;). These tracks were subsequently given wider release as part of the B-side to the second 12-inch of &quot;The Power of Love&quot; single.

&quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; was also used on several promotional records in the USA during 1985, featuring the following tracks in various combinations:
*The second UK 7-inch mix of the track (&quot;Alternative Reel&quot;), labelled &quot;Trevor Horn Re-mix Edit&quot;.
*An edited version of the album track created by the Sacramento radio station KZAP, and known as &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome (KZAP Edit)&quot; (6:22)
*A version of the second UK 7-inch mix (&quot;Alternative Reel&quot;) with a new introduction added, and known as &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome (Urban Mix)&quot; (8:08). This is on the Bang! Japanese album and CD, alongside the digital &quot;Fruitness&quot; single.
*A slightly edited (spoken introduction removed) version of &quot;Relax (International)&quot; (4:26)

==Reissues==
The track has periodically been reissued as a single, including during 1993 and 2000. Although these releases have some admirers, and have usefully made available various original mixes on CD for the first time, the accompanying A-side remixes by contemporary DJs have tended on the whole to bear little or no comparison to the spirit of the originals.

Reissues in the group&#x27;s name have also tended to shun any overt reference to the identity of the original artists, and the reissue artwork has notably featured no images of the group. It has been suggested that this situation may relate to Johnson&#x27;s successful but acrimonious court case against ZTT in 1989, which freed him (and effectively the other group members) from their contract with the label.

<doc id="11264" wikidata="Q7282857" url="?curid=11264" title="Rage Hard">
<text>&quot;Rage Hard&quot; is the fifth single by English pop band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. It was released on 25 August 1986 as the first single from their second album &quot;Liverpool&quot;. The song reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in Germany and it was also a massive success in other countries.

==Background==

Having topped the charts around the world with &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; and its accompanying singles, Frankie Goes to Hollywood took off to Amsterdam to record the follow-up album, &quot;Liverpool&quot;. Taking on a rockier edge, &quot;Rage Hard&quot; was the first single culled from the album.

In a 1986 interview, singer Holly Johnson was asked about the meaning of the song explaining, &quot;Have you read the poem &#x27;Do Not Go Gently Into That Good Night&#x27; by Dylan Thomas? It was kind of inspired by that. It&#x27;s an incantation against death and lethargy, and it&#x27;s supposed to encourage lots of creative idealism in the listener.&quot; 

Not only was it the first Frankie single to be featured on CD single, it was also the first single to not feature a cassette release—new rules limited the number of items that could count towards the official charts, following the earlier ZTT excesses. &quot;Rage Hard&quot; eventually hit number 4 in the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in Germany for two weeks, #5 in Switzerland, #7 in the Netherlands, #12 in Austria, #19 in Sweden and #32 in France.

==Critical reception==
In a contemporary review, &quot;Billboard&quot; praised the band&#x27;s performance calling &quot;the matured Frankie socks out weight art-rock best suited to AOR/ alternative radio.&quot; Ro Newton of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; compared the single unfavorably with their previous releases as, &quot;watered-down and without the guts. The over all effect is a bit limp and very disappointing.&quot;

==B-sides==
The original B-side is an odd composition entitled &quot;(Don&#x27;t Lose What&#x27;s Left) Of Your Little Mind&quot;. It was released in two versions—a 4-minute mix and a 6-minute mix—and featured Holly Johnson and Brian Nash imitating Count von Count (&quot;Ha ha ha/I am the Count&quot;) from the children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. This was complemented by sampled burps and belches over a backing track.

For the 12&quot; single to &quot;Rage Hard&quot; were covers of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Suffragette City&quot;, stylized as &quot;SuffRAGEtte City&quot; to fit in with the &quot;Rage Hard&quot; promotion and the second cover song was the Doors&#x27; &quot;Roadhouse Blues.&quot; A shorter version features on the CD single.

<doc id="11267" wikidata="Q1358484" url="?curid=11267" title="Liverpool (album)">
<text>Liverpool is the second and final studio album by British band Frankie Goes to Hollywood, released in October 1986. Produced by Stephen Lipson and mixed by Trevor Horn, the album showcases a heavy rock sound in contrast to the synth dance tone found in its predecessor, &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot;. The recording sessions would be marred by the radical change in musical direction creating tension within the band.

The album received mixed reviews from critics and was a commercial disappointment compared to its predecessor, but it charted at number 5 in the United Kingdom and was a modest success in other countries. It would be supported by the lead single “Rage Hard”, a UK number 5 and number 1 in Germany. &quot;Liverpool&quot; would be the band&#x27;s final album as lead singer Holly Johnson would leave the band followed by a flurry of lawsuits from ZTT.

==Recording==
Johnson was distant from the band during the sessions and was unhappy about the album&#x27;s focus on rock over dance. Jill Sinclair, Horn&#x27;s wife and one of the ZTT founders, later alleged that Johnson had been uncooperative and absent for most of the sessions. According to Nash, Johnson was preoccupied with the serious illness of Wolfgang Kuhle, then Johnson&#x27;s boyfriend, but he did not tell the band. Johnson&#x27;s distancing and disinterest came to the point that the band members concluded he was &quot;finished and were in the market for a new singer&quot;. They invited Duran Duran singer Simon Le Bon but he declined, Pete Wylie was also approached, but Johnson eventually remained with the band and completed &quot;Liverpool&quot;. The session studio recordings were made in Ibiza, Holland and London.

==Production==
The album&#x27;s production was handled by Trevor Horn&#x27;s engineer Stephen Lipson, who urged the band to play their own instruments on this album (Horn having replaced many of the band&#x27;s performances and arrangements with his session musicians or his own performances on &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot;). According to Nash, the band was given contradicting information, with Horn considered as a producer or executive producer. In the end Horn took over mixing it on which &quot;spent a whopping £500,000 (making £840,000 in all) tidying it up&quot;. The band was so much in debt that they had to sell at least a million copies to start earning &quot;a penny&quot;.

==Music==
&quot;Liverpool&quot; features a heavier rock sound than its predecessor. Frankie Goes to Hollywood have not released any more studio albums since &quot;Liverpool&quot;. The cover photo was different depending on what format was purchased (LP, cassette, or compact disc).

==Release==
The album was a commercial disappointment compared to the band&#x27;s previous effort, though it charted generally high at No. 5 in the United Kingdom and Germany, No. 7 on the Austrian and Swiss music charts and No. 8 in Norway. It produced the top 5 single &quot;Rage Hard&quot; (No. 1 in Germany), top 20 single &quot;Warriors of the Wasteland&quot; and top 30 single &quot;Watching the Wildlife&quot;. By March 1988, the album had sold around 800,000 copies. On 20 June 2011 was released a 2xCD reissue including session recordings, mixes and covers of David Bowie, the Doors and Rolling Stones.

==Critical reception==
In the 80s and 90s the album received poor critical reception. &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; wrote: &quot;Like most of the era&#x27;s one-hit wonders, the group did make a second album, though God only knows why anyone would want to hear it.&quot;

Alex S. Garcia writing 2.5/5 review for AllMusic considered that &quot;on many accounts, &quot;Liverpool&quot; can be considered as an improvement over its predecessor&quot;, that being shorter duration and almost the same quality of all songs, and &quot;the production is impeccable ... worth a listen if you like the band or have an interest for 80s music—of which this is not such a bad sample&quot;.

Paul Lester in BBC review of 2011 reissue noted how &quot;many of the [original] tracks are straight hard rock/metal, with the lavish sonics and orchestral pomp typical of the ZTT label dropped on top&quot;, and that the reissue is &quot;a superb repackage of what remains one of the great anticlimaxes in pop&quot;. Lester compared the original album to the similar &quot;climb-down&quot; records ABC&#x27;s &quot;Beauty Stab&quot; (1983) and Simple Minds&#x27; &quot;Sparkle in the Rain&quot; (1984), &quot;those other early-80s albums where the bands in question retreated from studio opulence towards a more &#x27;authentic&#x27; approach that proved they could reproduce the music live; that they were Proper Rock Bands.&quot;

Steve Howe, who played on the album, said in a 2023 interview, &quot;I just was hoping so much that &quot;Liverpool&quot; [...] would [...] make a meaningful dent in the [...] success of the band because it was just great.&quot;

<doc id="11273" wikidata="Q25258" url="?curid=11273" title="Faroese language">
<text>Faroese ( ; ) is a North Germanic language spoken as a first language by about 69,000 Faroe Islanders, of whom 21,000 reside mainly in Denmark and elsewhere.

It is one of five languages descended from Old West Norse spoken in the Middle Ages; the others include Norwegian, Icelandic, and the extinct Norn and Greenlandic Norse. Faroese and Icelandic, its closest extant relative, are not easily mutually intelligible in speech, but the written languages resemble each other quite closely, largely owing to Faroese&#x27;s etymological orthography.

==History==


Around 900 AD, the language spoken in the Faroes was Old Norse, which Norse settlers had brought with them during the time of the settlement of Faroe Islands () that began in 825. However, many of the settlers were not from Scandinavia, but descendants of Norse settlers in the Irish Sea region. In addition, women from Norse Ireland, Orkney, or Shetland often married native Scandinavian men before settling in the Faroe Islands and Iceland. As a result, the Irish language has had some influence on both Faroese and Icelandic.

There is speculation about Irish language place names in the Faroes: for example, the names of Mykines, Stóra Dímun, Lítla Dímun and Argir have been hypothesized to contain Celtic roots. Other examples of early-introduced words of Celtic origin are: / (buttermilk), cf. Middle Irish ; (tail-piece of an animal), cf. Middle Irish ; (head, headhair), cf. Middle Irish ; (hand, paw), cf. Middle Irish ; (bull), cf. Middle Irish ; and (pasture in the outfield), cf. Middle Irish .

Between the 9th and the 15th centuries, a distinct Faroese language evolved, although it was probably still mutually intelligible with Old West Norse, and remained similar to the Norn language of Orkney and Shetland during Norn&#x27;s earlier phase.

Faroese ceased to be a written language after the Danish–Norwegian Reformation of the early 16th century, with Danish replacing Faroese as the language of administration and education. The islanders continued to use the language in ballads, folktales, and everyday life. This maintained a rich spoken tradition, but for 300 years the language was not used in written form.

In 1823, the Danish Bible Society published a diglot of the Gospel of Matthew, with Faroese on the left and Danish on the right.

Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb and the Icelandic grammarian and politician Jón Sigurðsson published a written standard for Modern Faroese in 1854, which still exists. They set a standard for the orthography of the language, based on its Old Norse roots and similar to that of Icelandic. The main purpose of this was for the spelling to represent the diverse dialects of Faroese in equal measure. Additionally, it had the advantages of being etymologically clear and keeping the kinship with the Icelandic written language. The actual pronunciation, however, often differs considerably from the written rendering. The letter &quot;ð&quot;, for example, has no specific phoneme attached to it.

Jakob Jakobsen devised a rival system of orthography, based on his wish for a phonetic spelling, but this system was never taken up by the speakers.

In 1908, Scripture Gift Mission published the Gospel of John in Faroese.

In 1937, Faroese replaced Danish as the official school language, in 1938, as the church language, and in 1948, as the national language by the Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands. The first complete translation of the Bible was completed in 1948.

Up until the 1980s public radio broadcasts were primarily conducted in Norwegian and Danish. This helps to explain why older generations can speak Norwegian in addition to Danish and Faroese. Faroese broadcasts quickly replaced earlier programs and now all radio content is transmitted in the language, alongside all local newspapers. Today, Danish is considered a foreign language, although around 5% of residents on the Faroes learn it as a first language. Both Danish and English are obligatory at the primary and secondary school levels, with fluency in English becoming increasingly valued particularly among the younger generations. Films and television are frequently shown in English with Danish subtitles.

In 2017, the tourist board Visit Faroe Islands launched a website entitled Faroe Islands Translate. Text can be entered in thirteen languages, including English, Chinese, Russian, Japanese, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Instead of an instant machine translation being given, the text goes to a volunteer who will provide a live video translation, or else a recorded one later. The aim of this project was to get Faroese featured on Google Translate.
== Old Faroese ==
Old Faroese (, ca. mid-14th to mid-16th centuries) is a form of Old Norse spoken in medieval times in the Faroe Islands. The most crucial aspects of the development of Faroese are diphthongisation and palatalisation.

There is not enough data available to establish an accurate chronology of Faroese, but a rough one may be developed through comparison to the chronologies of Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian. In the 12th/13th centuries, &quot;á&quot; and &quot;ǫ́&quot; merged as ; later on at the beginning of the 14th century, delabialization took place: &quot;y&quot;, &quot;øy&quot;, &quot;au&quot; &gt; ; &quot;í&quot; and &quot;ý&quot; merged in addition to &quot;i&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, but in the case of &quot;í&quot; and &quot;ý&quot;, it appears that labialisation took place instead as is documented by later development to . Further, the language underwent a palatalisation of &quot;k&quot;, &quot;g&quot; and &quot;sk&quot; before Old Norse &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;ø&quot;, &quot;au&quot; &gt; &gt; &gt; . Before the palatalisation &quot;é&quot; and &quot;ǽ&quot; merged as and approximately in the same period epenthetic &quot;u&quot; is inserted into word-final and clusters.

A massive quantity shift also operated in Middle Faroese. In the case of &quot;skerping&quot;, it took place after delabialization but before loss of post-vocalic &quot;ð&quot; and &quot;g&quot; . The shift of &quot;hv&quot; to , the deletion of in (remaining) word-initial –sonorant clusters (&quot;hr&quot;, &quot;hl&quot;, &quot;hn&quot; &gt; &quot;r&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;n&quot;), and the dissolution of &quot;þ&quot; (&quot;þ&quot; &gt; &quot;t&quot;; &quot;þ&quot; &gt; &quot;h&quot; in demonstrative pronouns and adverbs) appeared before the end of the 13th century. Another undated change is the merger of &quot;ǫ&quot;, &quot;ø&quot; and &quot;ǿ&quot; into ; pre-nasal &quot;ǫ&quot;, &quot;ǫ́&quot; &gt; &quot;o&quot;, &quot;ó&quot;. &quot;enk&quot;, &quot;eng&quot; probably became , in the 14th century; the development of &quot;a&quot; to before &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;nk&quot; appeared after the palatalisation of &quot;k&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, and &quot;sk&quot; had been completed, such a change is quite a recent development, as well as change &quot;Cve&quot; &gt; &quot;Cvø&quot;.

== Dialects ==

Faroese is a highly variable language with many dialects actively used across the islands’ approximately 120 communities. While the dialect of Tórshavn is the most prominent due to the city&#x27;s outstanding size, there is no official spoken standard variety, and little evidence that the Tórshavn dialect has developed prestige status. Faroese speech communities are tightly knit and the use of dialectal speech is widely encouraged.

The study of Faroese dialectology began hundreds of years ago, with the scholar Lucas Debes noting a north–south distinction as early as 1673. In the 18th century linguist Jens Christian Svabo made further distinctions, such as identifying the Tórshavn dialect, though his categorization lacked thorough justification. In 1891 Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb would write a more definitive study of the language&#x27;s variation, noting distinguishing characteristics of the north–south divide such as the northern aspiration of unvoiced plosives after long vowels and the pronunciation of as in most of the north compared to in the south.

The most recent and detailed classification by Hjalmar P. Petersen divides the language into four major varieties including North-Western Faroese, Central Faroese, Northern Faroese, and Southern Faroese. Additional sub-dialects of particular islands and villages have also been identified. Most of the analysis by Petersen and earlier authors is based on phonological evidence.

The southern variety of Faroese is very distinct, possibly due to geographic distance exacerbated by the lack of underwater tunnels which have connected most other islands north of Sandur. The dialect of these islands is characterized by a unique form of certain personal pronouns, alongside phonological features such as the intervocalic voicing of non-geminate stops. The fortis consonants , , and are aspirated following long vowels.

The central dialect area centered around Suðurstreymoy features a merging of and in unstressed ending syllables. The fortis consonants are neither aspirated nor weakened. The island of Nólsoy is a notable transitional area due to its unique realization of long as and short as compared to the and found in Tórshavn and elsewhere.

The northern dialect is characterized by weakened fortis consonants and a monophthongal pronunciation of in ending syllables, i.e., . The realization of as dominates in this region, although small parts of the central and northwestern regions use this pronunciation as well.

The northwestern dialect features aspirated fortis consonants after long vowels. The and vowels remain unmerged in unstressed ending syllables. Long is pronounced and short is pronounced .

== Alphabet ==

The Faroese alphabet consists of 29 letters derived from the Latin script:

== Phonology ==
As with most other Germanic languages, Faroese has a large number of vowels, with 26 in total. Vowel distribution is similar to other North Germanic languages in that short vowels appear in closed syllables (those ending in consonant clusters or long consonants) and long vowels appearing in open syllables.

Faroese shares with Icelandic and Danish the feature of maintaining a contrast between stops based exclusively on aspiration, not voicing. Geminated stops may be pre-aspirated in intervocalic and word-final position. Intervocalically the aspirated consonants become pre-aspirated unless followed by a closed vowel. In clusters, the preaspiration merges with a preceding nasal or apical approximant, rendering them voiceless.

There are several phonological processes involved in Faroese, including:
*Nasals generally assume the place of articulation and laryngeal settings of following consonants.
*Velar stops palatalize to postalveolar affricates before and 
* becomes before voiceless consonants
* becomes after and before 
* becomes retroflex before consonants in consonant clusters, yielding the allophones while itself becomes , example: is realized as .
*Pre-occlusion of original to and to .
*Pre-aspiration of original voiceless stops after non-high long vowels and diphthongs or when a voiceless stop is followed by . All long voiceless stops are pre-aspirated when doubled or in clusters .

==Grammar==

Faroese grammar is related and very similar to that of modern Icelandic and Old Norse. Faroese is an inflected language with three grammatical genders and four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive.

<text>In particle physics, an elementary particle or fundamental particle is a subatomic particle that is not composed of other particles. The Standard Model presently recognizes seventeen distinct particles—twelve fermions and five bosons. As a consequence of flavor and color combinations and antimatter, the fermions and bosons are known to have 48 and 13 variations, respectively. Among the 61 elementary particles embraced by the Standard Model number: electrons and other leptons, quarks, and the fundamental bosons. Subatomic particles such as protons or neutrons, which contain two or more elementary particles, are known as composite particles.

Ordinary matter is composed of atoms, themselves once thought to be indivisible elementary particles. The name &quot;atom&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word &quot;ἄτομος&quot; () which means &quot;indivisible&quot; or &quot;uncuttable&quot;. Despite the theories about atoms that had existed for thousands of years, the factual existence of atoms remained controversial until 1905. In that year, Albert Einstein published his paper on Brownian motion, putting to rest theories that had regarded molecules as mathematical illusions. Einstein subsequently identified matter as ultimately composed of various concentrations of energy.

Subatomic constituents of the atom were first identified toward the end of the 19th century, beginning with the electron, followed by the proton in 1919, the photon in the 1920s, and the neutron in 1932. By that time, the advent of quantum mechanics had radically altered the definition of a &quot;particle&quot; by putting forward an understanding in which they carried out a simultaneous existence as matter waves.

Many theoretical elaborations upon, and beyond, the Standard Model have been made since its codification in the 1970s. These include notions of supersymmetry, which double the number of elementary particles by hypothesizing that each known particle associates with a &quot;shadow&quot; partner far more massive. However, like an additional elementary boson mediating gravitation, such superpartners remain undiscovered as of 2013.

== Overview ==

All elementary particles are either bosons or fermions. These classes are distinguished by their quantum statistics: fermions obey Fermi–Dirac statistics and bosons obey Bose–Einstein statistics. Their spin is differentiated via the spin–statistics theorem: it is half-integer for fermions, and integer for bosons.

In the Standard Model, elementary particles are represented for predictive utility as point particles. Though extremely successful, the Standard Model is limited by its omission of gravitation and has some parameters arbitrarily added but unexplained.

== Cosmic abundance of elementary particles ==
According to the current models of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the primordial composition of visible matter of the universe should be about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium-4 (in mass). Neutrons are made up of one up and two down quarks, while protons are made of two up and one down quark. Since the other common elementary particles (such as electrons, neutrinos, or weak bosons) are so light or so rare when compared to atomic nuclei, we can neglect their mass contribution to the observable universe&#x27;s total mass. Therefore, one can conclude that most of the visible mass of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, which, like all baryons, in turn consist of up quarks and down quarks.

Some estimates imply that there are roughly baryons (almost entirely protons and neutrons) in the observable universe.

The number of protons in the observable universe is called the Eddington number.

In terms of number of particles, some estimates imply that nearly all the matter, excluding dark matter, occurs in neutrinos, which constitute the majority of the roughly elementary particles of matter that exist in the visible universe. Other estimates imply that roughly elementary particles exist in the visible universe (not including dark matter), mostly photons and other massless force carriers.

== Standard Model ==

The Standard Model of particle physics contains 12 flavors of elementary fermions, plus their corresponding antiparticles, as well as elementary bosons that mediate the forces and the Higgs boson, which was reported on July 4, 2012, as having been likely detected by the two main experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ATLAS and CMS). The Standard Model is widely considered to be a provisional theory rather than a truly fundamental one, however, since it is not known if it is compatible with Einstein&#x27;s general relativity. There may be hypothetical elementary particles not described by the Standard Model, such as the graviton, the particle that would carry the gravitational force, and sparticles, supersymmetric partners of the ordinary particles.

=== Fundamental fermions ===
The 12 fundamental fermions are divided into 3 generations of 4 particles each. Half of the fermions are leptons, three of which have an electric charge of −1 &quot;e&quot;, called the electron (), the muon (), and the tau (); the other three leptons are neutrinos (, , ), which are the only elementary fermions with neither electric nor color charge. The remaining six particles are quarks (discussed below).

==== Generations ====
==== Mass ====
The following table lists current measured masses and mass estimates for all the fermions, using the same scale of measure: millions of electron-volts relative to square of light speed (MeV/&quot;c&quot;2). For example, the most accurately known quark mass is of the top quark () at , estimated using the on-shell scheme.

Estimates of the values of quark masses depend on the version of quantum chromodynamics used to describe quark interactions. Quarks are always confined in an envelope of gluons that confer vastly greater mass to the mesons and baryons where quarks occur, so values for quark masses cannot be measured directly. Since their masses are so small compared to the effective mass of the surrounding gluons, slight differences in the calculation make large differences in the masses.

==== Antiparticles ====
There are also 12 fundamental fermionic antiparticles that correspond to these 12 particles. For example, the antielectron (positron) is the electron&#x27;s antiparticle and has an electric charge of +1 &quot;e&quot;.

==== Quarks ====

Isolated quarks and antiquarks have never been detected, a fact explained by confinement. Every quark carries one of three color charges of the strong interaction; antiquarks similarly carry anticolor. Color-charged particles interact via gluon exchange in the same way that charged particles interact via photon exchange. Gluons are themselves color-charged, however, resulting in an amplification of the strong force as color-charged particles are separated. Unlike the electromagnetic force, which diminishes as charged particles separate, color-charged particles feel increasing force.

Nonetheless, color-charged particles may combine to form color neutral composite particles called hadrons. A quark may pair up with an antiquark: the quark has a color and the antiquark has the corresponding anticolor. The color and anticolor cancel out, forming a color neutral meson. Alternatively, three quarks can exist together, one quark being &quot;red&quot;, another &quot;blue&quot;, another &quot;green&quot;. These three colored quarks together form a color-neutral baryon. Symmetrically, three antiquarks with the colors &quot;antired&quot;, &quot;antiblue&quot; and &quot;antigreen&quot; can form a color-neutral antibaryon.

Quarks also carry fractional electric charges, but, since they are confined within hadrons whose charges are all integral, fractional charges have never been isolated. Note that quarks have electric charges of either  &quot;e&quot; or  &quot;e&quot;, whereas antiquarks have corresponding electric charges of either  &quot;e&quot; or  &quot;e&quot;.

Evidence for the existence of quarks comes from deep inelastic scattering: firing electrons at nuclei to determine the distribution of charge within nucleons (which are baryons). If the charge is uniform, the electric field around the proton should be uniform and the electron should scatter elastically. Low-energy electrons do scatter in this way, but, above a particular energy, the protons deflect some electrons through large angles. The recoiling electron has much less energy and a jet of particles is emitted. This inelastic scattering suggests that the charge in the proton is not uniform but split among smaller charged particles: quarks.

=== Fundamental bosons ===
In the Standard Model, vector (spin-1) bosons (gluons, photons, and the W and Z bosons) mediate forces, whereas the Higgs boson (spin-0) is responsible for the intrinsic mass of particles. Bosons differ from fermions in the fact that multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state (Pauli exclusion principle). Also, bosons can be either elementary, like photons, or a combination, like mesons. The spin of bosons are integers instead of half integers.

==== Gluons ====
Gluons mediate the strong interaction, which join quarks and thereby form hadrons, which are either baryons (three quarks) or mesons (one quark and one antiquark). Protons and neutrons are baryons, joined by gluons to form the atomic nucleus. Like quarks, gluons exhibit color and anticolor – unrelated to the concept of visual color and rather the particles&#x27; strong interactions – sometimes in combinations, altogether eight variations of gluons.

==== Electroweak bosons ====
There are three weak gauge bosons: W+, W−, and Z0; these mediate the weak interaction. The W bosons are known for their mediation in nuclear decay: The W− converts a neutron into a proton then decays into an electron and electron-antineutrino pair.
The Z0 does not convert particle flavor or charges, but rather changes momentum; it is the only mechanism for elastically scattering neutrinos. The weak gauge bosons were discovered due to momentum change in electrons from neutrino-Z exchange. The massless photon mediates the electromagnetic interaction. These four gauge bosons form the electroweak interaction among elementary particles.

==== Higgs boson ====
Although the weak and electromagnetic forces appear quite different to us at everyday energies, the two forces are theorized to unify as a single electroweak force at high energies. This prediction was clearly confirmed by measurements of cross-sections for high-energy electron-proton scattering at the HERA collider at DESY. The differences at low energies is a consequence of the high masses of the W and Z bosons, which in turn are a consequence of the Higgs mechanism. Through the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs selects a special direction in electroweak space that causes three electroweak particles to become very heavy (the weak bosons) and one to remain with an undefined rest mass as it is always in motion (the photon). On 4 July 2012, after many years of experimentally searching for evidence of its existence, the Higgs boson was announced to have been observed at CERN&#x27;s Large Hadron Collider. Peter Higgs who first posited the existence of the Higgs boson was present at the announcement. The Higgs boson is believed to have a mass of approximately . The statistical significance of this discovery was reported as 5 sigma, which implies a certainty of roughly 99.99994%. In particle physics, this is the level of significance required to officially label experimental observations as a discovery. Research into the properties of the newly discovered particle continues.

==== Graviton ====

The graviton is a hypothetical elementary spin-2 particle proposed to mediate gravitation. While it remains undiscovered due to the difficulty inherent in its detection, it is sometimes included in tables of elementary particles. The conventional graviton is massless, although some models containing massive Kaluza–Klein gravitons exist.

== Beyond the Standard Model ==
Although experimental evidence overwhelmingly confirms the predictions derived from the Standard Model, some of its parameters were added arbitrarily, not determined by a particular explanation, which remain mysterious, for instance the hierarchy problem. Theories beyond the Standard Model attempt to resolve these shortcomings.

=== Grand unification ===
One extension of the Standard Model attempts to combine the electroweak interaction with the strong interaction into a single &#x27;grand unified theory&#x27; (GUT). Such a force would be spontaneously broken into the three forces by a Higgs-like mechanism. This breakdown is theorized to occur at high energies, making it difficult to observe unification in a laboratory. The most dramatic prediction of grand unification is the existence of X and Y bosons, which cause proton decay. The non-observation of proton decay at the Super-Kamiokande neutrino observatory rules out the simplest GUTs, however, including SU(5) and SO(10).

=== Supersymmetry ===
Supersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries to the Lagrangian. These symmetries exchange fermionic particles with bosonic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of supersymmetric particles, abbreviated as &quot;sparticles&quot;, which include the sleptons, squarks, neutralinos, and charginos. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose spin differs by from the ordinary particle. Due to the breaking of supersymmetry, the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary counterparts; they are so heavy that existing particle colliders would not be powerful enough to produce them. Some physicists believe that sparticles will be detected by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

=== String theory ===
String theory is a model of physics whereby all &quot;particles&quot; that make up matter are composed of strings (measuring at the Planck length) that exist in an 11-dimensional (according to M-theory, the leading version) or 12-dimensional (according to F-theory) universe. These strings vibrate at different frequencies that determine mass, electric charge, color charge, and spin. A &quot;string&quot; can be open (a line) or closed in a loop (a one-dimensional sphere, that is, a circle). As a string moves through space it sweeps out something called a &quot;world sheet&quot;. String theory predicts 1- to 10-branes (a 1-brane being a string and a 10-brane being a 10-dimensional object) that prevent tears in the &quot;fabric&quot; of space using the uncertainty principle (e.g., the electron orbiting a hydrogen atom has the probability, albeit small, that it could be anywhere else in the universe at any given moment).

String theory proposes that our universe is merely a 4-brane, inside which exist the three space dimensions and the one time dimension that we observe. The remaining 7 theoretical dimensions either are very tiny and curled up (and too small to be macroscopically accessible) or simply do not/cannot exist in our universe (because they exist in a grander scheme called the &quot;multiverse&quot; outside our known universe).

Some predictions of the string theory include existence of extremely massive counterparts of ordinary particles due to vibrational excitations of the fundamental string and existence of a massless spin-2 particle behaving like the graviton.

=== Technicolor ===
Technicolor theories try to modify the Standard Model in a minimal way by introducing a new QCD-like interaction. This means one adds a new theory of so-called Techniquarks, interacting via so called Technigluons. The main idea is that the Higgs boson is not an elementary particle but a bound state of these objects.

=== Preon theory ===
According to preon theory there are one or more orders of particles more fundamental than those (or most of those) found in the Standard Model. The most fundamental of these are normally called preons, which is derived from &quot;pre-quarks&quot;. In essence, preon theory tries to do for the Standard Model what the Standard Model did for the particle zoo that came before it. Most models assume that almost everything in the Standard Model can be explained in terms of three to six more fundamental particles and the rules that govern their interactions. Interest in preons has waned since the simplest models were experimentally ruled out in the 1980s.

=== Acceleron theory ===
Accelerons are the hypothetical subatomic particles that integrally link the newfound mass of the neutrino to the dark energy conjectured to be accelerating the expansion of the universe.

In this theory, neutrinos are influenced by a new force resulting from their interactions with accelerons, leading to dark energy. Dark energy results as the universe tries to pull neutrinos apart. Accelerons are thought to interact with matter more infrequently than they do with neutrinos.

<text>The Miami Marlins are an American professional baseball team based in Miami. The Marlins compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) East Division. The team plays its home games at LoanDepot Park.

The franchise began play as an expansion team in the 1993 season as the Florida Marlins. The Marlins originally played home games at Joe Robbie Stadium, which they shared with the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). In 2012, the team moved to LoanDepot Park (then known as Marlins Park), their first exclusive home and the first to be designed as a baseball park. As part of an agreement with park owner Miami-Dade County to use the stadium, the franchise also changed their name to the Miami Marlins prior to the 2012 season.

With a record of (), the Marlins have the lowest winning percentage and fewest postseason appearances (four) among active MLB franchises. Despite this, the Marlins won the World Series during their first two playoff runs in and . Only three players were on both World Series teams with the Marlins: Jeff Conine, Luis Castillo, and Rick Helling (both Conine and Castillo are the only Marlins to play a thousand games with the team). All four of their playoff appearances came as wild card teams, making them one of two MLB franchises (along with the Colorado Rockies) to have never won a division title, as well as the only franchise to have never appeared in back-to-back postseasons. The Marlins were also the first team to win the World Series as a wild card. The Marlins have no retired numbers, with the exception of Jackie Robinson&#x27;s universally retired #42 in 1997.

==History==

Wayne Huizenga, CEO of Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, was awarded an expansion franchise in the National League (NL) for a $95 million expansion fee and the team began operations in 1993 as the Florida Marlins. MLB had announced a few months earlier that it intended to add two new teams to the National League. It was a foregone conclusion that one of them would be placed in Florida; the only question was whether Huizenga would beat out competing groups from Orlando and Tampa Bay. Orlando waged a very spirited campaign bolstered by its family-oriented tourism industry. Tampa Bay already had a baseball park—the Florida Suncoast Dome in St. Petersburg, completed in 1990. However, on June 10, , the National League awarded a Miami-based franchise to Huizenga. The franchise adopted the nickname &quot;Marlins&quot; from previous minor league teams, the Miami Marlins of the Triple-A &#x27;s International League from 1956 to 1960, and the Miami Marlins (1962–70) and Miami Marlins (1982–88) teams that played in the Florida State League.

The Marlins&#x27; first manager was Rene Lachemann, a former catcher who had previously managed the Seattle Mariners and Milwaukee Brewers, and who at the time of his hiring was a third base coach for the Oakland Athletics. The team drafted its initial lineup of players in the 1992 MLB Expansion Draft. The Marlins defeated the Houston Astros 12–8 in their inaugural spring training game. Jeff Conine hit Florida&#x27;s first homer before a crowd of 6,696 at the Cocoa Expo Sports Complex. The Marlins won their first game on April 5, , against the Dodgers. Charlie Hough was the starting pitcher for that game. Jeff Conine went 4-for-4 as well, making him an immediate crowd favorite. By the end of his tenure with Florida, he had earned the nickname &quot;Mr. Marlin.&quot; Gary Sheffield and Bryan Harvey represented the Marlins as the club&#x27;s first All-Star Game selections, and Sheffield homered in the Marlins&#x27; first All-Star Game at-bat. The team finished the year five games ahead of the last-place New York Mets and with an attendance of 3,064,847. In that season, the Marlins traded young set-up reliever Trevor Hoffman and two minor-league prospects to the San Diego Padres for third baseman Gary Sheffield. While Sheffield helped Florida immediately and became an all-star, Hoffman eventually emerged as the best closer in the National League. After the 1993 season, Donald A. Smiley was named the second president in club history. The Marlins finished last (51–64) in their division in the strike-shortened season of and fourth (67–76) in . Lachemann was replaced as manager midway through the by director of player development John Boles.

=== 1997: First World Series title ===
Following an 80–82 record in 1996, former Pittsburgh Pirates manager Jim Leyland was hired to lead the club heading into 1997.

In 1997, the Marlins finished nine games back of the Division Champion Atlanta Braves, but earned the wild card berth. Veteran additions such as LF Moisés Alou, 3B Bobby Bonilla, and trade-deadline additions Darren Daulton and Jim Eisenreich added experience and clutch hits. Talented young stars Luis Castillo (2B) and Édgar Rentería (SS) comprised one of the best double play combos in the NL. The Marlins swept the San Francisco Giants 3–0 in the National League Division Series, and then went on to beat the Atlanta Braves 4–2 in the National League Championship Series, overcoming the loss of Alex Fernandez to a torn rotator cuff, and Kevin Brown to a virus. Brown&#x27;s place was taken in Game 5 by rookie pitcher Liván Hernández, who struck out 15 Braves and outdueled multiple Cy Young Award winner Greg Maddux to a 2–1 victory. The underdog Marlins went on to face the Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series, and won in seven games. In Game 7, Craig Counsell&#x27;s sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth tied the game at 2, then, with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 11th, Édgar Rentería&#x27;s soft liner glanced off the glove of Cleveland pitcher Charles Nagy and into center field to score Counsell and give the Marlins the win.

=== 2003: Second World Series victory ===
On May 9, the Marlins called up high-kicking southpaw Dontrelle Willis from the Double-A Carolina Mudcats and helped carry the injury-plagued Marlins with an 11–2 record in his first 17 starts. Miguel Cabrera (also from the Mudcats) filled in well, hitting a walk-off home run in his first major league game, against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Pro Player Stadium. Both Willis and Cabrera would later prove to be essential parts of the Marlin&#x27;s playoff success. Jeff Conine – an original Marlin and member of the 1997 World Series team – returned from Baltimore, Hall of Fame catcher Iván Rodríguez signed with the Marlins as a free agent and closer Ugueth Urbina arrived from the Texas Rangers. These acquisitions helped to keep the team in contention, and although they finished ten games behind the Braves, the Marlins captured the NL wild card.

On October 15, the Marlins defeated the Chicago Cubs four games to three in the 2003 National League Championship Series, coming back from a 3–1 deficit. Game 6 saw the Marlins play a role in one of baseball&#x27;s most infamous moments, the Steve Bartman incident. With one out in the eighth inning and the Cubs three runs ahead, Marlins second baseman Luis Castillo hit a pop foul a row into the stands along the third baseline. Cubs fan Steve Bartman reached for the ball, preventing Cubs left fielder Moisés Alou from making the out and setting off an eight-run Marlins rally. The incident with Bartman and a come-from-behind win in Wrigley Field in Game 7 helped the Marlins capture their second NL pennant, keeping the &quot;Curse of the Billy Goat&quot; alive and well.

In the 2003 World Series, the Marlins defeated the heavily favored New York Yankees in six games, winning the sixth game in Yankee Stadium. Shortstop Álex González helped the Marlins in Game 4 of the series with a walk-off home run in extra innings. Josh Beckett was named the Most Valuable Player for the series after twirling a five-hit complete-game shutout in Game 6. Skipper Jack McKeon became the oldest manager ever to win a World Series title.
=== 2012–present ===
In 2012, the team moved from the football-oriented Sun Life Stadium (located in Miami Gardens) to Marlins Park in downtown Miami. As a condition of the move, the team was renamed the Miami Marlins, and adopted a new logo and colors. On November 16, 2017, Giancarlo Stanton won the National League MVP, becoming the first Marlin to win the award.

During the 2020 shortened season, the Marlins finished with a 31–29 overall record and 2nd place in the NL East. In the Wild Card Series they swept the Chicago Cubs in 2 games. Miami loss in three games to the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS.

On November 13, 2020, the Marlins became the first club in any American major-level sports league to hire a woman to an executive position when Kim Ng was announced as the team&#x27;s general manager. In addition, she will also be MLB&#x27;s first Asian American general manager. On February 28, 2022, it was announced Derek Jeter stepped down as CEO of the Marlins. On September 30, 2023, with the Marlins 7–3 win in Pittsburgh, the Marlins clinched their fourth postseason berth, making Kim Ng the first woman GM in MLB history to lead a playoff team.

==Uniform history==
===1993–2002===
The Florida Marlins debuted wearing three different uniforms. The primary and alternate home uniforms shared the same design: &quot;Marlins&quot; (with an underline after the letter &quot;S&quot;) in teal with black trim and letters were rendered in black with teal trim, along with teal pinstripes. The alternate home uniforms were sleeveless, and teal undershirts were added to the ensemble. The road uniforms featured &quot;Florida&quot; (with the marlin wrapped around the letter &quot;F&quot;) in teal with black trim and letters were rendered in black with teal trim. The primary logo patch was placed on the left sleeve. The Marlins wore three different cap designs, all featuring the &quot;F&quot; insignia in front of a leaping marlin. The all-teal home cap and the black-brimmed teal road cap were initially the primary headwear the team used, with the all-black cap as the alternate.

By the late 1990s, teal was gradually de-emphasized and the Marlins wore black caps and undershirts for the remainder of the uniform&#x27;s run.
===2003–2011===
The Marlins introduced new uniforms before its second World Series-winning season. On the home uniforms, teal was relegated to accent color status with black the primary lettering and pinstripe color. Silver accents were also added to the letters. A sleeved alternate pinstriped home uniform replaced the original sleeveless version, sharing the same design as the primary home uniform except with the &quot;F&quot; logo on the left chest. The &quot;F&quot; logo also took its place on the left sleeve in place of the primary logo. Road uniforms again featured &quot;Florida&quot; but shared the same script look and color scheme as the home uniform (with an underline after the letter &quot;A&quot;). White accents were added to the letters. In addition, the Marlins began wearing a black alternate uniform, featuring the same &quot;Marlins&quot; script but in silver with teal, black and white accents. Both alternate uniforms lacked the front chest numbers.

In 2010, the Marlins changed its road uniform design, replacing &quot;Florida&quot; with &quot;Marlins&quot;. The sleeve logo patches were also removed.
===2012–2018===
Rebranding as the Miami Marlins, the team introduced a new color scheme with orange, black and blue. The &quot;M&quot; insignia is white with orange, yellow and sky blue accents, along with a stylized abstract marlin on top. This logo served as a cap logo as well as a patch on the left sleeve. The primary home, road and black alternate uniforms all feature &quot;Miami&quot; in front, with the first &quot;M&quot; shaped similarly to the cap and sleeve logos. The home and road uniform feature black letters with silver trim, along with orange drop shadows on the numbers, while the alternate black uniform feature white letters with silver trim and orange numbers with silver trim and black drop shadows. The orange alternate uniform featured the team name in white with sky blue accents; however the abstract marlin was located atop the letter &quot;I&quot;. Letters were black with silver trim, while sky blue drop shadows were featured on the numbers. The Marlins primarily wore all-black caps, though for a brief period they wore alternate all-orange caps.
===Since 2019===
The Marlins released updated logos and color schemes, replacing orange and silver with bright Caliente red, Miami blue and slate grey. Home and road uniforms contain &#x27;Miami&quot; and letters in black with red drop shadows and blue accents, while the black alternate uniform contain &quot;Marlins&quot; and letters in black with red drop shadows and blue accents. The cap logo, used on the all-black cap, is a stylized &quot;M&quot; with a more realistic marlin on top. The Marlin logo also appears on the left sleeve.

In 2021, the Marlins unveiled a City Connect uniform. The primarily red uniform with Miami blue trim paid homage to the Cuban Sugar Kings.

In 2024, the Marlins updated their black alternate uniform, changing the letters to white in order to improve visibility. They also introduced a new Miami blue alternate uniform, featuring the black &quot;Marlins&quot; lettering with white trim and red drop shadows. This was originally their Spring Training uniform, albeit with the &quot;M&quot; logo on the left chest.

==Rivalry==
===Citrus Series===

The Rays also have a geographical, interleague rivalry with the Miami Marlins. Tampa Bay currently leads the series, 81–60.

==World Series championships==
The Marlins won the World Series in 1997 and 2003, but both titles were followed by controversial periods where the team sold off all the high-priced players and rebuilt. Between 2003 and 2019, the team&#x27;s two World Series runs also marked their sole postseason appearances. Their three playoff qualifications and seven winning seasons are the fewest among MLB franchises.

Despite never winning a division title, the Florida Marlins is the only team to make the playoffs and win a World Series in its first two winning seasons.

===Retired numbers===
From 1993 until 2011, the Marlins had retired the number 5 in honor of Carl Barger, the first president of the Florida Marlins, who had died prior to the team&#x27;s inaugural season. Barger&#x27;s favorite player was Joe DiMaggio, thus the selection of number 5. With the move to LoanDepot Park, the team opted to honor Barger with a plaque instead, and opened number 5 to circulation. Logan Morrison, a Kansas City native and fan of Royals Hall-of-Famer George Brett (who wore that number with the Royals), became the first Marlins player to wear the number. As of 2024, the Marlins are the only franchise with no retired numbers for former players, and while seven former players are in the Hall of Fame, none wear a Marlins cap on their plaque or have the Marlins listed as their primary team.

After José Fernández&#x27;s death as a result of a boating accident on September 25, 2016, the Miami Marlins built a memorial at LoanDepot Park in his honor, which displays his number 16. Fernández&#x27;s number has yet to be officially retired, but remains inactive.

The 2025 inaugural Hall of Fame class features four members, each of whom will be inducted during certain points of the season.


==Minor league affiliations==
The Miami Marlins farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates.

==Radio and television==

The Marlins&#x27; flagship radio station from their inception in 1993 through 2007 was WQAM 560 AM. Although the Marlins had plans to leave WQAM after 2006, they remained with WQAM for the 2007 season. On October 11, 2007, the Marlins announced an agreement with WAXY 790 AM to broadcast all games for the 2008 season. Longtime Montreal Expo and current Marlins play-by-play radio announcer Dave Van Horne won the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Ford C. Frick Award for excellence in baseball broadcasting in 2010. He shares the play-by-play duties with Glenn Geffner.

Games are also broadcast in Spanish on Radio Mambi 710 AM. Felo Ramírez called play-by-play on that station from 1993 to 2017 along with Luis Quintana, won the Ford C. Frick Award from the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001.

Marlins games are televised by Bally Sports Florida. Paul Severino serves as the play-by-play announcer with Tommy Hutton, J.P. Arencibia, Gaby Sánchez and Jeff Nelson. Jessica Blaylock host&#x27;s &quot;Marlins Live&quot; and is the Marlins on site reporter.

==Culture==
In 1989, &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; had a reference to the Chicago Cubs defeating a baseball team from Miami in the 2015 World Series, ending the longest championship drought in all four of the major North American professional sports leagues. In actuality, the Cubs would end up getting swept in four games by the New York Mets in the NLCS, the Marlins failed to make the postseason, and the 2015 World Series was between the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets, with the Royals winning in five games. Also, both the Cubs and Marlins are part of the National League, rendering a World Series matchup between the two teams impossible.

The Marlins were the first team in Major League Baseball to have a dance/cheer team. Debuting in 2003, the &quot;Marlins Mermaids&quot; influenced other MLB teams to develop their own cheer/dance squads. In 2008, the Florida Marlins debuted &quot;The Marlins Manatees&quot;, Major League Baseball&#x27;s first all-male dance/energy squad, to star alongside the Mermaids. As of 2012, the Marlins have abandoned the &quot;Mermaids&quot; and &quot;Manatees&quot; for in-game entertainment instead using an &quot;energy squad&quot;, a co-ed group of dancers. In 2019, the Marlins brought back the Mermaids for the first time since 2012.

The Marlins have had many official anthems over the years, performed by such artists as Pitbull, DJ Khaled, Poo Bear and Creed frontman Scott Stapp. Stapp penned their 2010 anthem Marlins Will Soar.

On July 16, 2022, the Marlins became the second NL team to form a cheering section for fans when it opened &quot;Sandy&#x27;s Beach&quot; at Section 22 of LoanDepot Park for supporters of team starter Sandy Alcantara. Fans assigned to this section, located near the 3rd base line, wear beach related clothing in an nod to the city&#x27;s famous beaches whenever Sandy pitchers on select game days.

<doc id="11281" wikidata="Q5506083" url="?curid=11281" title="Frontline (Australian TV series)">
<text>Frontline is an Australian comedy television series which satirised Australian television current affairs programmes and reporting. It ran for three series of 13 half-hour episodes and was broadcast on ABC TV in 1994, 1995 and 1997.

==Production==

The series was written, directed and produced by Jane Kennedy, Santo Cilauro, Rob Sitch and Tom Gleisner. They created and performed in the television shows &quot;The D-Generation&quot; and &quot;The Late Show&quot; before creating &quot;Frontline&quot; (as well as &quot;Funky Squad&quot; between series 1 and 2 of &quot;Frontline&quot;). After &quot;Frontline&quot; they moved into feature films, making several popular Australian movies including &quot;The Castle&quot; and &quot;The Dish&quot;, and hosted &quot;The Panel&quot; for several years, before moving on to &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot; and later &quot;Have You Been Paying Attention?&quot;.

The series was partly inspired by a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; special &quot;Has the media gone too far?&quot;. It bears some similarity to the UK series &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot;.

==Setting==
===A commercial network===
The series follows the fortunes of a fictional current affairs show, &quot;Frontline&quot;. In the show, &quot;Frontline&quot; competes directly with Nine&#x27;s &quot;A Current Affair&quot; and Seven&#x27;s &quot;Real Life&quot;, which changed its name to &quot;Today Tonight&quot; from 1995 onwards.

The &quot;Frontline&quot; office showcases and satirises the machinations of the ruthless producers, the self-obsessed airhead host, and the ambitious, cynical reporters, all of whom resort to any sort of underhanded trick to get ratings and maintain their status—including the use of hidden cameras, foot-in-the-door, bullying interview techniques, and chequebook journalism. They ingratiate themselves with the all-powerful network bosses, while the real work is in fact done by their long-suffering production staff.

The station itself also runs other television shows referenced by &quot;Frontline&quot; staff, such as 6 o&#x27;clock news program, a 3-hour news review show &quot;Sunday Forum&quot;, a sketch show &quot;The Komedy Bunch&quot;, a game show &quot;Jackpot&quot;, a teen soap opera &quot;Sunshine Cove&quot; which later changed to &quot;Rainbow Island&quot;, also lesser mentioned shows such as the football show &quot;Ball-to-Ball&quot;, &quot;Late-Night OZ&quot;, &quot;Cartoon Crazies&quot;, &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, &quot;Face the Press&quot; and &quot;Vacation&quot;.

===As a commentary===
The characters and situations were often thinly-disguised parodies of recent real events and real people, giving the show&#x27;s comedy a black edge. In particular, the Season 1 episode &quot;The Siege&quot; was a replay of a controversial real life incident which had occurred just a few months earlier, told as though &quot;Frontline&quot; itself had covered the story.

The dim-witted, egotistical host Mike Moore was a parody of current television hosts and journalists. Sitch has claimed that none of the characters were directly based on a single person, and indeed the character of Moore was a combination of well-known characteristics of a number of high-profile television figures, including &quot;A Current Affair&quot; host Ray Martin, Martin&#x27;s predecessor Mike Willesee, and &quot;Real Life&quot; host Stan Grant.

The ABC&#x27;s media review show &quot;Media Watch&quot; was featured prominently. Much of the real life journalistic misconduct reported on &quot;Media Watch&quot; later appeared on &quot;Frontline&quot; in fictionalised form. One example of this was when &quot;Media Watch&quot; reported that Dave &quot;Sluggo&quot; Richardson had made a highly misleading report on Christopher Skase for &quot;Today Tonight&quot;. Richardson was suspended from duty for a month, and in the &quot;One Rule for One&quot; episode of &quot;Frontline&quot;, fictional reporter Martin di Stasio is suspended for a month for doing exactly the same thing.

Multiple episodes of &quot;Frontline&quot; featured &quot;Media Watch&quot; segments criticising the show.

== Episodes ==

== Characters ==
===Reporters===
* Mike Moore (Rob Sitch) is the anchor of &quot;Frontline&quot;. He is self-centred and dim-witted, but his intentions are generally noble. Mike is very protective of what he calls his &quot;journalistic integrity&quot; and resents any insinuation that he is a lightweight. He believes that he is on the cutting edge of journalism, but is oblivious to most of &quot;Frontline&quot;″s content, as the executive producers go to some length to keep him out of production meetings, and a running gag within the show sees Mike ignore most of the stories that &quot;Frontline&quot; airs despite his position as host. Mike is desperate for any sort of publicity he can get, but his public appearances are a constant source of amusement for the rest of the &quot;Frontline&quot; team, as they typically end in disaster. While usually harmless, Mike is not above using underhanded tactics to get his way—in &quot;A Hole in the Heart&quot; (series 3), he steals a story from Marty because viewers are responding positively to it, while in &quot;Addicted to Fame&quot;, he demands that Geoffrey&#x27;s television show be cancelled because he is jealous of the attention his friend is getting. In the first two series Mike&#x27;s position is constantly under threat from senior reporter Brooke Vandenberg, who has a better press profile, but by the last series he has been cemented as one of the network&#x27;s most valuable stars and considerably more effort is made to pander to his whims. While Mike is usually portrayed as simply dumb (for example, in &quot;A Man of His Convictions&quot; in series 2 he writes a letter to media commentator Stuart Littlemore full of basic spelling and grammatical errors) he occasionally surprises his colleagues with his sneakiness: in &quot;Give &#x27;em Enough Rope&quot; (series 2) he traps the network owner into admitting to contravening the Broadcasting Act in a live interview, after first getting the owner to publicly commit to allowing him to ask difficult questions without threat to his job. Many gags centre around how easily he is manipulated by his executive producer, the most typical case being when Mike refuses to present a story and then is convinced to run it by an appeal to his supposed fearlessness or journalistic integrity. Mike used to work for the ABC until he was &quot;poached&quot; to run &quot;Frontline&quot;.
* Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) is a reporter on &quot;Frontline&quot;. She is ambitious, amoral and publicity hungry. While there are constant rumours that she has affairs with male celebrities in order to build her profile, in some cases she simply creates the rumours herself; in &quot;The Desert Angel&quot; (series 1) she confesses to Pat Cash that she started a rumour about having an affair with him. Like most of the employees of &quot;Frontline&quot;, she has no ethical problems with any action the show takes to get a good story. She is, however, portrayed as being very hypocritical; in &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (series 1), she has no issues with violating peoples&#x27; privacy when she runs a story using a hidden camera to catch shoplifters in a store change room, but is outraged when a rival network violates her own privacy in the same way when broadcasting a similar story. Brooke is also very vain, and tends to edit her stories to give herself as much screen time as she can manage. When a new segment producer edits footage of Brooke out of a story in &quot;I Disease&quot; (series 3), she becomes upset to the point where she demands that the producer be fired for it. In &quot;A Hole in the Heart&quot;, Brooke discovers she is pregnant to a former boyfriend and is bribed into having an abortion by a new hosting offer.
* Martin &quot;Marty&quot; Di Stasio (Tiriel Mora) is a senior reporter on &quot;Frontline&quot;. He is Mike&#x27;s major antagonist on the team, often baiting him about sensitive topics, such as the supposedly anti-Semitic golf club of which Mike is a member (&quot;A Hole in the Heart&quot;), or whenever Mike&#x27;s public appearances end in disaster. He is the most experienced journalist on the team: a few references are made to him winning a Walkley Award. Like Brooke, he is uncritical of the show&#x27;s journalistic tactics (although in the episode &quot;Judge and Jury&quot;, he has reservations about their persecution of a priest accused of rape, mainly because he is a lapsed Catholic); in fact he is usually the confidante of the executive producers, and the one they can trust to do what is needed to get a good story, or to persuade Mike to present a story. His position on &quot;Frontline&quot; is more tenuous than that of Mike or Brooke: in &quot;Dick on the Line&quot; (series 3) he tells Mike and Brooke that at his age he signs his yearly contract immediately and does not mess about negotiating.

===Producers===
* Emma Ward (Alison Whyte) is the Line Producer on &quot;Frontline&quot;. She questions the show&#x27;s practices most frequently and acts as the viewers&#x27; conscience. In &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; (series 2), she is the only member of the team to have read the supposedly racist book the show is attacking and objects to their incendiary treatment of its author. Early in series 2 and 3, the executive producers of the time approach Marty and ask him to explain Emma. Marty explains that while she has moral qualms like Mike does, she is more difficult to handle because she is intelligent. Despite often objecting, Emma is usually party to ethically questionable practices and occasionally finds them amusing. In &quot;A Hole in the Heart (part 2)&quot;, to placate a director from charity organisation Rotary, she allows the executive producer to yell at her and pretend to fire her over one of the show&#x27;s decisions, when in reality she is receiving a large pay rise in return for her part of the act.
* Kate Preston (Trudy Hellier) is the segment producer. While Kate is friendly with Emma, who has a more senior position, Kate has fewer ethical qualms about stories than Emma, and tends to be in the middle of conflicts between Emma and the executive producer.
* Brian &quot;Thommo&quot; Thompson (Bruno Lawrence) is the executive producer during series 1. He is fired by the network in the first episode of series 2, although he is never shown on screen in that episode; the real reason for this is that Lawrence died of lung cancer between the filming of series 1 and series 2, forcing the writers to create a new executive producer character, Sam (see below).
* Sam Murphy (Kevin J. Wilson) is the executive producer during series 2, hired immediately after Brian is fired. Thommo&#x27;s and Sam&#x27;s characters are similar; a hard-nosed EP who would not hesitate to air questionable stories to attract ratings.
* Graham &quot;Prowsey&quot; Prowse (Steve Bisley) is the executive producer during series 3, hired after the producer who took &quot;Frontline&quot; to the top retires. Prowsey is much more aggressive and unpleasant than his two predecessors. He has a bad temper, is unpleasant to the staff and is unashamedly sexist: groping the female staff, dismissing bulimia as a &quot;chick thing&quot; and writing off Brooke&#x27;s bad moods as PMS. He is, however, like his predecessors, capable of being charming when needed to deceive Mike, placate Emma or feed Brooke&#x27;s ego.

===Supporting staff===
* Domenica Baroni (Anita Cerdic) is the office receptionist, and the only person in the office who truly admires Mike. Her increasingly bizarre hairstyles become a running gag, culminating in &quot;Give &#x27;em Enough Rope&quot;, when she is completely bald and festooned with ribbons. Her reactions to the show usually reflect the target audience&#x27;s responses. She is a reluctant and sometimes traitorous party to the office&#x27;s determination to keep Mike away from production meetings. She is always very supportive of Mike and there are often hints that she actually has a crush on him. Domenica occasionally contributes to stories run by the show, such as when she receives a tipoff from a relative in &quot;Divide the Community, Multiply the Ratings&quot; or when she is the only female staff member willing to go undercover in a nightclub in &quot;My Generation&quot;.
* Shelley Cohen (Linda Ross) is the executive producer&#x27;s secretary. She has worked for the network for many years and is usually unfazed by the mishaps in the office.
* Stuart &quot;Stu&quot; O&#x27;Hallaran (Pip Mushin) is the office&#x27;s main cameraman and shoots most of Brooke&#x27;s and Marty&#x27;s stories. He, Marty and Jase are all friends and frequently make fun of Mike.
* Jason &quot;Jase&quot; Cotter (Torquil Neilson) is the sound recordist who works with Stu. Jase is not actually heard speaking until series 3 despite appearing in most episodes in series 1 and 2. He is fired in the episode &quot;I Get the Big Names&quot; for audio taping Brooke Vandanberg while she urinates on the toilet and then leaking it to the media.
* Hugh Tabbagh (Marcus Eyre) is the editor of videos, who is almost always seen editing in the audio-visual room whilst sitting, smoking cigarettes, coughing wildly and inhaling an asthma puffer.
* Trev (Stephen Curry) appears as Jase&#x27;s replacement as the sound recordist towards the end of the third series.

=== Network employees ===
* Geoffrey Salter (Santo Cilauro) is the network&#x27;s weatherman and Mike&#x27;s closest friend at work. Geoff usually appears in private conversations in his office with Mike, and is often the catalyst for Mike to question the reassurance he has been given by a producer that the story of the moment is being ethically pursued. Despite his being Mike&#x27;s closest friend, Mike frequently ignores Geoff&#x27;s issues, and their conversations often serve to reinforce Mike&#x27;s beliefs. Geoff is unpopular with the rest of the &quot;Frontline&quot; staff to the point where he is banned from the &quot;Frontline&quot; set, but they are all supportive when he unexpectedly achieves popularity with his own one-hour programme in &quot;Addicted to Fame&quot; (series 3), though he is unaware that Mike demanded the plans for the expansion of the show be cancelled because he was jealous of the attention Geoff was getting. He is the focus of a running gag where he will laugh hysterically along with Mike at any anecdote Mike tells him, before admitting that he does not understand it.
* Ian Farmer (Gerard Kennedy) is the Station Manager, the boss of the local studios. He appears only in series one. He and Brian Thompson are good friends, and frequently play golf together.
* Bob Caville (Peter Stratford) is the network&#x27;s managing director, and definitively pulls the office into line.
* Jan Whelan (Genevieve Mooy) is the network&#x27;s head of publicity in series 1 and 2. Jan refers to everyone as &quot;poppet&quot; and &quot;darling&quot; and has extravagantly camp mannerisms, but is in fact practical and efficient.
* Trish (Lynda Gibson) is the network&#x27;s head of publicity in series 3. Gibson also appears in &quot;Workin&#x27; Class Man&quot; from series 2 as the wife/mother of three of a working-class family who is visited by Brooke for a story regarding the difficulties of making ends meet.
* Elliot Rhodes (Boris Conley) is a comedian and musician, performing short musical sketches about current events at the end of Friday night episodes of &quot;Frontline&quot;. Mike detests his act but is required to laugh uproariously and compliment it on air every week. In two episodes, he was fired at Mike&#x27;s request.

=== Special guests ===
&quot;Frontline&quot; frequently featured celebrity cameos, unusually including major Australian politicians appearing as themselves, often but not always as interviewees. The most memorable appearance is that of Pauline Hanson in &quot;The Shadow We Cast&quot; (series 3), in which she turns her famous &quot;please explain?&quot; phrase on Mike. Noel Pearson appears as an interviewee later in the same episode. Other appearances include: John Hewson in &quot;The Soufflé Rises&quot; (series 1); Pat Cash in &quot;The Desert Angel&quot;; Cheryl Kernot in &quot;We Ain&#x27;t Got Dames&quot; (series 1); Ben Elton, Bert Newton, Rosemary Margan, Amanda Keller and Anne Fulwood in &quot;This Night of Nights&quot; (series 1); Glenn Ridge in &quot;Add Sex and Stir&quot; and &quot;Office Mole&quot; (series 2); Glenn Robbins and Molly Meldrum in &quot;Add Sex and Stir&quot;; George Negus in &quot;Add Sex and Stir&quot; and &quot;Dick on the Line&quot; (series 3); and Ian Baker-Finch in &quot;A Hole in the Heart&quot;. Harry Shearer appeared in the series 2 episode &quot;Changing the Face of Current Affairs&quot;, where he played the character of Larry Hadges. Merv Hughes also starred in the series 2 episode &quot;Workin&#x27; Class Man&quot;.

Other guest stars appeared in mock-ups of their own shows: Mike Moore appeared on fictitious episodes of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Backyard&quot; with Don Burke, Rex Hunt&#x27;s fishing show, and &quot;The AFL Footy Show&quot; with Sam Newman. Stuart Littlemore, who at the time was hosting the media commentary show &quot;Media Watch&quot;, appeared in several fictitious episodes as a critic of &quot;Frontline&quot;.

== Production strategies ==
&quot;Frontline&quot; broke new ground for Australian situation comedy, by adopting some innovative production strategies. Its rapid production schedule was inspired by UK series &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot;, where each episode was written and taped in a single week and scripts were closely based on the real news stories of the preceding seven days.

The &quot;Frontline&quot; scripts were likewise written and the series filmed with a short period, often within a single week. It was a fully collaborative effort, with Cilauro, Kennedy, Gleisner and Sitch all sharing writing and directing duties, and the cast all contributing ideas during all stages of production. So sometimes when the show appeared on then-current events, it was a coincidence, as episodes were delayed by several months. In other cases there was direct commentary on real events, albeit not extremely recent ones.

To create a heightened illusion of grainy documentary realism, footage was shot under fluorescent lights in an actual office building set, and taped on hand-held Hi-8 camcorders usually operated by Gleisner and Cilauro. The footage was then transferred onto film and finally transferred back to videotape (see: Kinescope). Footage that was portrayed as being part of the &quot;Frontline&quot; broadcast (i.e., studio or field reports) was shot at broadcast quality, to increase the &quot;realism&quot; of the satire and complement the behind-the-scenes footage.

== Other airings ==
In 1997, Channel Seven bought the rights to the series; however, they only aired a handful of episodes. The show was perceived by management as &quot;too close to the bone&quot; for a network significantly focused upon its prime-time current affairs ratings battle with rival stations. The Comedy Channel has shown the series as late as 2005. It was shown again on ABC TV in 2018 and in 2020–21.

In America, &quot;Frontline&quot; was shown as either &quot;Behind the Frontline&quot; on cable or as &quot;Breaking News&quot; on PBS (which already has a news series titled &quot;Frontline&quot;).

In the UK, series 1 and 2 were shown by the Paramount Comedy Channel. Series 3, however, was never screened.

In Canada, it was aired as &quot;Behind the Frontline&quot; on Showcase in 1997.

== Impact ==
The series was extremely popular through its run, winning a Logie Award for Most Outstanding Achievement in Comedy in 1995, and a Logie for Alison Whyte as most outstanding actress in 1997. Critics often place Frontline at or near the top of lists of &quot;the best Australian TV shows ever made&quot;.

Six episodes from series one were a core text in the Year 12 English Advanced syllabus for the Higher School Certificate in New South Wales (2000–2008) for Module C: Representation and Text: Elective 1: Telling the Truth. The episodes are &quot;Playing the Ego Card&quot;, &quot;Add Sex and Stir&quot;, &quot;The Siege&quot;, &quot;Smaller Fish to Fry&quot;, &quot;We Ain&#x27;t Got Dames&quot;, and &quot;This Night of Nights&quot;. The show has also been used as a text response for both Years 11 and 12 in the English units of the Victorian Certificate of Education. Episodes of &quot;Frontline&quot; have been analysed for the Media topic in the Year 10 English syllabus in New South Wales since at least 2001 and in Western Australia since at least 2009.

==MentalAs campaign==
In October 2014, Sitch reprised the role of Mike Moore and &quot;Frontline&quot; during a short sketch on the &quot;Friday Night Crack Up&quot; as part of the ABC&#x27;s &quot;MentalAs&quot; campaign to raise money and awareness for mental health issues.

<doc id="11282" wikidata="Q13515" url="?curid=11282" title="Frédéric Bastiat">
<text>Claude-Frédéric Bastiat (; ; 30 June 1801 – 24 December 1850) was a French economist, writer and a prominent member of the French liberal school.

A member of the French National Assembly, Bastiat developed the economic concept of opportunity cost and introduced the parable of the broken window. He was described as &quot;the most brilliant economic journalist who ever lived&quot; by economic theorist Joseph Schumpeter.

As an advocate of classical economics and the economics of Adam Smith, his views favored a free market and influenced the Austrian School. He is best known for his book &quot;The Law&quot;, where he argued that law must protect rights such as private property, not &quot;plunder&quot; others&#x27; property.

== Biography ==

Bastiat was born on 29 June 1801 in Bayonne, Aquitaine, a port town in the south of France on the Bay of Biscay. His father, Pierre Bastiat, was a prominent businessman in the town. His mother died in 1808 when Frédéric was seven years old. His father moved inland to the town of Mugron, with Frédéric following soon afterward. The Bastiat estate in Mugron had been acquired during the French Revolution and had previously belonged to the Marquis of Poyanne. Pierre Bastiat died in 1810, leaving Frédéric an orphan. He was fostered by his paternal grandfather and his unmarried aunt Justine Bastiat. He attended a school in Bayonne, but his aunt thought poorly of it and so enrolled him in the school Saint-Sever. At age 17, he left school at Sorèze to work for his uncle in his family&#x27;s export business. It was the same firm where his father had been a partner.

Bastiat began to develop an intellectual interest as he no longer wished to work with his uncle and desired to go to Paris for formal studies. This hope was not realized as his grandfather was in poor health and wished to go to the Mugron estate. Bastiat accompanied him and cared for him. The next year when Bastiat was 24, his grandfather died, leaving him the family estate, thereby providing him with the means to further his theoretical inquiries. Bastiat developed intellectual interests in several areas including philosophy, history, politics, religion, travel, poetry, political economy and biography. After the middle-class Revolution of 1830, Bastiat became politically active and was elected justice of the peace of Mugron in 1831 and to the Council General (county-level assembly) of Landes in 1832. Bastiat was elected to the national legislative assembly after the French Revolution of 1848.

His public career as an economist began only in 1844, when his first article was published in the &quot;Journal des économistes&quot; during October of that year and it was ended by his untimely death in 1850. Bastiat contracted tuberculosis, probably during his tours throughout France to promote his ideas and that illness eventually prevented him from making further speeches (particularly at the legislative assembly to which he was elected in 1848 and 1849) and ended his life. In &quot;The Law&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Until the day of my death, I shall proclaim this principle with all the force of my lungs (which alas! is all too inadequate)&quot;.

This last line is understood by translators to be a reference to the effects of his tuberculosis. During the autumn of 1850, he was sent to Italy by his doctors, and he first traveled to Pisa, then to Rome. On 24 December 1850, Bastiat called those with him to approach his bed and murmured twice the words &quot;the truth&quot; before he died at the age of 49.

== Works ==

Bastiat was the author of many works on economics and political economy, generally characterized by their clear organization, forceful argumentation and acerbic wit. Economist Murray Rothbard wrote that &quot;Bastiat was indeed a lucid and superb writer, whose brilliant and witty essays and fables to this day are remarkable and devastating demolitions of protectionism and of all forms of government subsidy and control. He was a truly scintillating advocate of an unrestricted free market&quot;. However, Bastiat himself declared that subsidy should be available, albeit limited under extraordinary circumstances, saying the following: &quot;Under extraordinary circumstances, for urgent cases, the State should set aside some resources to assist certain unfortunate people, to help them adjust to changing conditions&quot;.

Among his better-known works is &quot;Economic Sophisms&quot;, a series of essays (originally published in the &quot;Journal des économistes&quot;) which contain a defence of free trade. Bastiat wrote the work while living in England to advise the shapers of the French Republic on perils to avoid. &quot;Economic Sophisms&quot; was translated and adapted for an American readership in 1867 by the economist and historian of money Alexander del Mar, writing under the pseudonym Emile Walter.

=== &quot;Economic Sophisms&quot; and the candlemakers&#x27; petition ===
Contained within &quot;Economic Sophisms&quot; is the satirical parable known as the candlemakers&#x27; petition in which candlemakers and tallow producers lobby the Chamber of Deputies of the French July Monarchy (1830–1848) to block out the Sun to prevent its unfair competition with their products. Also included in the &quot;Sophisms&quot; is a facetious petition to the king asking for a law forbidding the usage of everyone&#x27;s right hand, based on a presumption by some of his contemporaries that more difficulty means more work and more work means more wealth.

=== &quot;The Law&quot; (1850) ===
Bastiat&#x27;s most famous work is &quot;The Law&quot;, originally published as a pamphlet in 1850. It defines a just system of laws and then demonstrates how such law facilitates a free society. In &quot;The Law&quot;, Bastiat wrote that everyone has a right to protect &quot;his person, his liberty, and his property&quot;. The state should be only a &quot;substitution of a common force for individual forces&quot; to defend this right. According to Bastiat, justice (meaning defense of one&#x27;s life, liberty and property) has precise limits, but if government power extends further into philanthropic endeavors, then government becomes so limitless that it can grow endlessly. The resulting statism is &quot;based on this triple hypothesis: the total inertness of mankind, the omnipotence of the law, and the infallibility of the legislator&quot;. The public then becomes socially engineered by the legislator and must bend to the legislators&#x27; will &quot;like the clay to the potter&quot;, saying: Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.

I do not dispute their right to invent social combinations, to advertise them, to advocate them, and to try them upon themselves, at their own expense and risk. But I do dispute their right to impose these plans upon us by law – by force – and to compel us to pay for them with our taxes.

Bastiat posits that the law becomes perverted when it punishes one&#x27;s right to self-defense (of his life, liberty and property) in favor of another&#x27;s right to legalized plunder which he defines as &quot;if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime&quot; in which he includes the tax support of &quot;protective tariffs, subsidies, guaranteed profits, guaranteed jobs, relief and welfare schemes, public education, progressive taxation, free credit, and public works&quot;. According to Bastiat, legal plunder can be committed in &quot;an infinite number of ways. Thus, we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it: tariffs, protection, benefits, subsidies, encouragements, progressive taxation, public schools, guaranteed jobs, guaranteed profits, minimum wages, a right to relief, a right to the tools of labor, free credit, and so on, and so on. All these plans as a whole — with their common aim of legal plunder — constitute socialism&quot;. Bastiat also made the following humorous point: &quot;If the natural tendencies of mankind are so bad that it is not safe to permit people to be free, how is it that the tendencies of these organizers are always good? Do not the legislators and their appointed agents also belong to the human race? Or do they believe that they themselves are made of a finer clay than the rest of mankind?&quot;

=== &quot;What is Seen and What is Not Seen&quot; ===
In his 1850 essay &quot;Ce qu&#x27;on voit et ce qu&#x27;on ne voit pas&quot; (&quot;What is seen and what is not seen&quot;), Bastiat introduced through the parable of the broken window the concept of opportunity cost in all but name. This term was not coined until over sixty years after his death by Friedrich von Wieser in 1914.

=== Debate with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon ===
Bastiat also famously engaged in a debate between 1849 and 1850 with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon about the legitimacy of interest. As Robert Leroux argued, Bastiat had the conviction that Proudhon&#x27;s anti-interest doctrine &quot;was the complete antithesis of any serious approach&quot;. Proudhon famously lost his temper and resorted to personal attacks: &quot;Your intelligence is asleep, or rather it has never been awake. You are a man for whom logic does not exist. You do not hear anything, you do not understand anything. You are without philosophy, without science, without humanity. Your ability to reason, like your ability to pay attention and make comparisons is zero. Scientifically, Mr. Bastiat, you are a dead man.&quot;

Bastiat asserted that the sole purpose of government is to protect the right of an individual to life, liberty and property and that it is dangerous and morally wrong for government to interfere with an individual&#x27;s other personal matters. From this, Bastiat concluded that the law cannot defend life, liberty and property if it promotes legal or legalized plunder which he defined as using government force and laws to take something from one individual and give it to others (as opposed to a transfer of property via mutually agreed contracts without using fraud or violent threats against the other party, which Bastiat considered a legitimate transfer of property).

In &quot;The Law&quot;, Bastiat explains that if the privileged classes or socialists use the government for legalized plunder, this will encourage the other socioeconomic class to also use legal plunder and that the correct response to the socialists is to cease all legal plunder. Bastiat also explains why his opinion is that the law cannot defend life, liberty and property if it promotes socialist policies. When used to obtain legalized plunder for any group, he says that the law is perverted against the only things (life, liberty and property) it is supposed to defend.

Bastiat was a strong supporter of free trade who was inspired by and routinely corresponded with Richard Cobden and the English Anti-Corn Law League and worked with free-trade associations in France.

Because of his emphasis on the mutual gains to be had from free exchange, on subjective value, and on the importance of deductive reasoning (as opposed to mathematical models) in deriving economic conclusions, Bastiat has been described by Mark Thornton, Thomas DiLorenzo and other economists as a forerunner of the Austrian School, with Thornton positing that through taking this position on the motivations of human action he demonstrates a pronounced &quot;Austrian flavor.&quot;

<doc id="11283" wikidata="Q220888" url="?curid=11283" title="Falsifiability">
<text>Falsifiability (or refutability) is a deductive standard of evaluation of scientific theories and hypotheses, introduced by the philosopher of science Karl Popper in his book &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot; (1934). A theory or hypothesis is falsifiable if it can be &quot;logically&quot; contradicted by an empirical test.

Popper emphasized the asymmetry created by the relation of a universal law with basic observation statements and contrasted falsifiability to the intuitively similar concept of verifiability that was then current in logical positivism. He argued that the only way to verify a claim such as &quot;All swans are white&quot; would be if one could theoretically observe all swans, which is not possible. On the other hand, the falsifiability requirement for an anomalous instance, such as the observation of a single black swan, is theoretically reasonable and sufficient to logically falsify the claim.

Popper proposed falsifiability as the cornerstone solution to both the problem of induction and the problem of demarcation. He insisted that, as a logical criterion, his falsifiability is distinct from the related concept &quot;capacity to be proven wrong&quot; discussed in Lakatos&#x27;s falsificationism. Even being a logical criterion, its purpose is to make the theory predictive and testable, and thus useful in practice.

By contrast, the Duhem–Quine thesis says that definitive experimental falsifications are impossible and that no scientific hypothesis is by itself capable of making predictions, because an empirical test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions.

Popper&#x27;s response is that falsifiability does not have the Duhem problem because it is a logical criterion. Experimental research has the Duhem problem and other problems, such as the problem of induction, but, according to Popper, statistical tests, which are only possible when a theory is falsifiable, can still be useful within a critical discussion.

As a key notion in the separation of science from non-science and pseudoscience, falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.

==The problem of induction and demarcation==
One of the questions in the scientific method is: how does one move from observations to scientific laws? This is the problem of induction. Suppose we want to put the hypothesis that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue (or &quot;induce&quot;) from &quot;here is a white swan&quot; to &quot;all swans are white&quot;; doing so would require a logical fallacy such as, for example, affirming the consequent.

Popper&#x27;s idea to solve this problem is that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that &quot;not&quot; every swan is white. Such falsification uses the valid inference &quot;modus tollens&quot;: if from a law formula_1 we logically deduce formula_2, but what is observed is formula_3, we infer that the law formula_1 is false. For example, given the statement formula_5 &quot;all swans are white&quot;, we can deduce formula_6 &quot;the specific swan here is white&quot;, but if what is observed is formula_7 &quot;the specific swan here is not white&quot; (say black), then &quot;all swans are white&quot; is false. More accurately, the statement formula_2 that can be deduced is broken into an initial condition and a prediction as in formula_9 in which formula_10 &quot;the thing here is a swan&quot; and formula_11 &quot;the thing here is a white swan&quot;. If what is observed is C being true while P is false (formally, formula_12), we can infer that the law is false.

For Popper, induction is actually never needed in science. Instead, in Popper&#x27;s view, laws are conjectured in a non-logical manner on the basis of expectations and predispositions. This has led David Miller, a student and collaborator of Popper, to write &quot;the mission is to classify truths, not to certify them&quot;. In contrast, the logical empiricism movement, which included such philosophers as Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath, and A. J. Ayer wanted to formalize the idea that, for a law to be scientific, it must be possible to argue on the basis of observations either in favor of its truth or its falsity. There was no consensus among these philosophers about how to achieve that, but the thought expressed by Mach&#x27;s dictum that &quot;where neither confirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not concerned&quot; was accepted as a basic precept of critical reflection about science.

Popper said that a demarcation criterion was possible, but we have to use the &quot;logical possibility&quot; of falsifications, which is falsifiability. He cited his encounter with psychoanalysis in the 1910s. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if one finds an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true. A verification has no value in itself. But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, there is a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all. In the definition of falsifiability, contradictions with observations are not used to support eventual falsifications, but for &quot;logical&quot; &quot;falsifications&quot; that show that the law makes risky predictions, which is completely different.

On the basic philosophical side of this issue, Popper said that some philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless. In opposition to this view, Popper said that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a criterion of demarcation.

===From Hume&#x27;s problem to non problematic induction===

The problem of induction is often called Hume&#x27;s problem. David Hume studied how human beings obtain new knowledge that goes beyond known laws and observations, including how we can discover new laws. He understood that deductive logic could not explain this learning process and argued in favour of a mental or psychological process of learning that would not require deductive logic. He even argued that this learning process cannot be justified by any general rules, deductive or not. Popper accepted Hume&#x27;s argument and therefore viewed progress in science as the result of quasi-induction, which does the same as induction, but has no inference rules to justify it. Philip N. Johnson-Laird, professor of psychology, also accepted Hume&#x27;s conclusion that induction has no justification. For him induction does not require justification and therefore can exist in the same manner as Popper&#x27;s quasi-induction does.

When Johnson-Laird says that no justification is needed, he does not refer to a general inductive method of justification that, to avoid a circular reasoning, would not itself require any justification. On the contrary, in agreement with Hume, he means that there is no general method of justification for induction and that&#x27;s ok, because the induction steps do not require justification. Instead, these steps use patterns of induction, which are not expected to have a general justification: they may or may not be applicable depending on the background knowledge. Johnson-Laird wrote: &quot;[P]hilosophers have worried about which properties of objects warrant inductive inferences. The answer rests on knowledge: we don&#x27;t infer that all the passengers on a plane are male because the first ten off the plane are men. We know that this observation doesn&#x27;t rule out the possibility of a woman passenger.&quot; The reasoning pattern that was not applied here is enumerative induction.

Popper was interested in the overall learning process in science, to quasi-induction, which he also called the &quot;path of science&quot;. However, Popper did not show much interest in these reasoning patterns, which he globally referred to as psychologism. He did not deny the possibility of some kind of psychological explanation for the learning process, especially when psychology is seen as an extension of biology, but he felt that these biological explanations were not within the scope of epistemology. Popper proposed an evolutionary mechanism to explain the success of science, which is much in line with Johnson-Laird&#x27;s view that &quot;induction is just something that animals, including human beings, do to make life possible&quot;, but Popper did not consider it a part of his epistemology. He wrote that his interest was mainly in the &quot;logic&quot; of science and that epistemology should be concerned with logical aspects only. Instead of asking why science succeeds he considered the pragmatic problem of induction. This problem is not how to justify a theory or what is the global mechanism for the success of science but only what methodology do we use to pick one theory among theories that are already conjectured. His methodological answer to the latter question is that we pick the theory that is the most tested with the available technology: &quot;the one, which in the light of our &quot;critical discussion&quot;, appears to be the best so far&quot;. By his own account, because only a negative approach was supported by logic, Popper adopted a negative methodology. The purpose of his methodology is to prevent &quot;the policy of immunizing our theories against refutation&quot;. It also supports some &quot;dogmatic attitude&quot; in defending theories against criticism, because this allows the process to be more complete. This negative view of science was much criticized and not only by Johnson-Laird.

In practice, some steps based on observations can be justified under assumptions, which can be very natural. For example, Bayesian inductive logic is justified by theorems that make explicit assumptions. These theorems are obtained with deductive logic, not inductive logic. They are sometimes presented as steps of induction, because they refer to laws of probability, even though they do not go beyond deductive logic. This is yet a third notion of induction, which overlaps with deductive logic in the following sense that it is supported by it. These deductive steps are not really inductive, but the overall process that includes the creation of assumptions is inductive in the usual sense. In a fallibilist perspective, a perspective that is widely accepted by philosophers, including Popper, every logical step of learning only creates an assumption or reinstates one that was doubted—that is all that science logically does.

==The elusive distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology==

Popper distinguished between the logic of science and its applied &quot;methodology&quot;. For example, the falsifiability of Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation, as defined by Popper, depends purely on the logical relation it has with a statement such as &quot;The brick fell upwards when released&quot;. A brick that falls upwards would not alone falsify Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation. The capacity to verify the absence of conditions such as a hidden string attached to the brick is also needed for this state of affairs to eventually falsify Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation. However, these applied methodological considerations are irrelevant in falsifiability, because it is a logical criterion. The empirical requirement on the potential falsifier, also called the &quot;material requirement&quot;, is only that it is observable inter-subjectively with existing technologies. There is no requirement that the potential falsifier can actually show the law to be false. The purely logical contradiction, together with the material requirement, are sufficient. The logical part consists of theories, statements, and their purely logical relationship together with this material requirement, which is needed for a connection with the methodological part.

The methodological part consists, in Popper&#x27;s view, of informal rules, which are used to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc. These include statistical tests: Popper is aware that observation statements are accepted with the help of statistical methods and that these involve methodological decisions. When this distinction is applied to the term &quot;falsifiability&quot;, it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term &quot;falsifiable&quot;. Popper said that he only uses &quot;falsifiability&quot; or &quot;falsifiable&quot; in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks instead of &quot;falsification&quot; and its problems.

Popper said that methodological problems require proposing methodological rules. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then one has retired oneself from the game of science. The logical side does not have such methodological problems, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because basic statements are not required to be possible. Methodological rules are only needed in the context of actual falsifications.

So observations have two purposes in Popper&#x27;s view. On the methodological side, observations can be used to show that a law is false, which Popper calls falsification. On the logical side, observations, which are purely logical constructions, do not show a law to be false, but contradict a law to show its falsifiability. Unlike falsifications and &quot;free from the problems of falsification&quot;, these contradictions establish the value of the law, which may eventually be corroborated.

Popper wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction between the logical aspect and the methodological aspect was not observed. This is still seen in a more recent literature. For example, in their 2019 article &quot;Evidence based medicine as science&quot;, Vere and Gibson wrote &quot;[falsifiability has] been considered problematic because theories are not simply tested through falsification but in conjunction with auxiliary assumptions and background knowledge.&quot;

==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==
===Basic statements===

In Popper&#x27;s view of science, statements of observation can be analyzed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations. The set of all purely logical observations that are considered constitutes the empirical basis. Popper calls them the &quot;basic statements&quot; or &quot;test statements&quot;. They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper says that basic statements do not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that they are accepted by convention as belonging to the empirical language, a language that allows intersubjective verifiability: &quot;they must be testable by intersubjective observation (the material requirement)&quot;. See the examples in section .

In more than twelve pages of &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot;, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that are considered in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law &quot;all swans are white&quot; the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as &quot;there exists a black swan&quot; is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, &quot;this swan here is black&quot; is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.

===The definition of falsifiability===

Thornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular &quot;observation-reports&quot;. He then gives Popper&#x27;s definition of falsifiability:
As in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary. The first decision described by Lakatos is implicit in this agreement, but the other decisions are not needed. This agreement, if one can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in detail and, as described in section , an actual agreement is needed. This may require using a deeper empirical basis, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ( gives some examples).

Popper says that despite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which the whole logical process of science would not be possible.

===Initial condition and prediction in falsifiers of laws===

In his analysis of the scientific nature of universal laws, Popper arrived at the conclusion that laws must &quot;allow us to deduce, roughly speaking, more &quot;empirical&quot; singular statements than we can deduce from the initial conditions alone.&quot; A singular statement that has one part only cannot contradict a universal law. A falsifier of a law has always two parts: the initial condition and the singular statement that contradicts the prediction.

However, there is no need to require that falsifiers have two parts in the definition itself. This removes the requirement that a falsifiable statement must make prediction. In this way, the definition is more general and allows the basic statements themselves to be falsifiable. Criteria that require that &quot;a law&quot; must be predictive, just as is required by falsifiability (when applied to laws), Popper wrote, &quot;have been put forward as criteria of the meaningfulness of sentences (rather than as criteria of demarcation applicable to theoretical systems) again and again after the publication of my book, even by critics who pooh-poohed my criterion of falsifiability.&quot;

===Falsifiability in model theory===

Scientists such as the Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon have studied the semantic aspects of the logical side of falsifiability. These studies were done in the perspective that a logic is a relation between formal sentences in languages and a collection of mathematical structures. The relation, usually denoted formula_13, says the formal sentence formula_14 is true when interpreted in the structure formula_15—it provides the semantic of the languages. According to Rynasiewicz, in this semantic perspective, falsifiability as defined by Popper means that in some observation structure (in the collection) there exists a set of observations which refutes the theory. An even stronger notion of falsifiability was considered, which requires, not only that there exists one structure with a contradicting set of observations, but also that all structures in the collection that cannot be expanded to a structure that satisfies formula_14 contain such a contradicting set of observations.

In response to Lakatos who suggested that Newton&#x27;s theory was as hard to show falsifiable as Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic theory, Popper gave the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another. Popper thought that it was a basic statement that was a potential falsifier for Newton&#x27;s theory, because the position of the apple at different times can be measured. Popper&#x27;s claims on this point are controversial, since Newtonian physics does not deny that there could be forces acting on the apple that are stronger than Earth&#x27;s gravity.

===Einstein&#x27;s equivalence principle===
Another example of a basic statement is &quot;The inert mass of this object is ten times larger than its gravitational mass.&quot; This is a basic statement because the inert mass and the gravitational mass can both be measured separately, even though it never happens that they are different. It is, as described by Popper, a valid falsifier for Einstein&#x27;s equivalence principle.

===Evolution===
====Industrial melanism====

In a discussion of the theory of evolution, Popper mentioned industrial melanism as an example of a falsifiable law. A corresponding basic statement that acts as a potential falsifier is &quot;In this industrial area, the relative fitness of the white-bodied peppered moth is high.&quot; Here &quot;fitness&quot; means &quot;reproductive success over the next generation&quot;. It is a basic statement, because it is possible to separately determine the kind of environment, industrial vs natural, and the relative fitness of the white-bodied form (relative to the black-bodied form) in an area, even though it never happens that the white-bodied form has a high relative fitness in an industrial area.

====Precambrian rabbit====
A famous example of a basic statement from J. B. S. Haldane is &quot;[These are] fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era.&quot; This is a basic statement because it is possible to find a fossil rabbit and to determine that the date of a fossil is in the Precambrian era, even though it never happens that the date of a rabbit fossil is in the Precambrian era. Despite opinions to the contrary, sometimes wrongly attributed to Popper, this shows the scientific character of paleontology or the history of the evolution of life on Earth, because it contradicts the hypothesis in paleontology that all mammals existed in a much more recent era. Richard Dawkins adds that any other modern animal, such as a hippo, would suffice.

===Simple examples of unfalsifiable statements===
A simple example of a non-basic statement is &quot;This angel does not have large wings.&quot; It is not a basic statement, because though the absence of large wings can be observed, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify angels. Even if it is accepted that angels exist, the sentence &quot;All angels have large wings&quot; is not falsifiable.

Another example from Popper of a non-basic statement is &quot;This human action is altruistic.&quot; It is not a basic statement, because no accepted technology allows us to determine whether or not an action is motivated by self-interest. Because no basic statement falsifies it, the statement that &quot;All human actions are egotistic, motivated by self-interest&quot; is thus not falsifiable.

===Omphalos hypothesis===
Some adherents of young-Earth creationism make an argument (called the Omphalos hypothesis after the Greek word for navel) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs. This ad hoc hypothesis introduced into young-Earth creationism is unfalsifiable because it says that the time of creation (of a species) measured by the accepted technology is illusory and no accepted technology is proposed to measure the claimed &quot;actual&quot; time of creation. Moreover, if the ad hoc hypothesis says that the world was created as we observe it today without stating further laws, by definition it cannot be contradicted by observations and thus is not falsifiable. This is discussed by Dienes in the case of a variation on the Omphalos hypothesis, which, in addition, specifies that God made the creation in this way to test our faith.

===Useful metaphysical statements===

 discussed statements such as &quot;All men are mortal.&quot; This is not falsifiable, because it does not matter how old a man is, maybe he will die next year. Maxwell said that this statement is nevertheless useful, because it is often corroborated. He coined the term &quot;corroboration without demarcation&quot;. Popper&#x27;s view is that it is indeed useful, because Popper considers that metaphysical statements can be useful, but also because it is indirectly corroborated by the corroboration of the falsifiable law &quot;All men die before the age of 150.&quot; For Popper, if no such falsifiable law exists, then the metaphysical law is less useful, because it is not indirectly corroborated. This kind of non-falsifiable statements in science was noticed by Carnap as early as 1937.
Maxwell also used the example &quot;All solids have a melting point.&quot; This is not falsifiable, because maybe the melting point will be reached at a higher temperature. The law is falsifiable and more useful if we specify an upper bound on melting points or a way to calculate this upper bound.

Another example from Maxwell is &quot;All beta decays are accompanied with a neutrino emission from the same nucleus.&quot; This is also not falsifiable, because maybe the neutrino can be detected in a different manner. The law is falsifiable and much more useful from a scientific point of view, if the method to detect the neutrino is specified. Maxwell said that most scientific laws are metaphysical statements of this kind, which, Popper said, need to be made more precise before they can be indirectly corroborated. In other words, specific technologies must be provided to make the statements inter-subjectively-verifiable, i.e., so that scientists know what the falsification or its failure actually means.

In his critique of the falsifiability criterion, Maxwell considered the requirement for decisions in the falsification of, both, the emission of neutrinos (see ) and the existence of the melting point. For example, he pointed out that had no neutrino been detected, it could have been because some conservation law is false. Popper did not argue against the problems of falsification per se. He always acknowledged these problems. Popper&#x27;s response was at the logical level. For example, he pointed out that, if a specific way is given to trap the neutrino, then, at the level of the language, the statement is falsifiable, because &quot;no neutrino was detected after using this specific way&quot; formally contradicts it (and it is inter-subjectively-verifiable—people can repeat the experiment).

===Natural selection===
In the 5th and 6th editions of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, following a suggestion of Alfred Russel Wallace, Darwin used &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot;, an expression first coined by Herbert Spencer, as a synonym for &quot;Natural Selection&quot;. Popper and others said that, if one uses the most widely accepted definition of &quot;fitness&quot; in modern biology (see subsection ), namely reproductive success itself, the expression &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; is a tautology.

Darwinist Ronald Fisher worked out mathematical theorems to help answer questions regarding natural selection. But, for Popper and others, there is no (falsifiable) law of Natural Selection in this, because these tools only apply to some rare traits. Instead, for Popper, the work of Fisher and others on Natural Selection is part of an important and successful metaphysical research program.

===Mathematics===
Popper said that not all unfalsifiable statements are useless in science. Mathematical statements are good examples. Like all formal sciences, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the empirical world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as quantity, structure, space and change. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable reality. Albert Einstein wrote, &quot;One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.&quot;

===Historicism===
Popper made a clear distinction between the original theory of Marx and what came to be known as Marxism later on. For Popper, the original theory of Marx contained genuine scientific laws. Though they could not make preordained predictions, these laws constrained how changes can occur in society. One of them was that changes in society cannot &quot;be achieved by the use of legal or political means&quot;. In Popper&#x27;s view, this was both testable and subsequently falsified. &quot;Yet instead of accepting the refutations&quot;, Popper wrote, &quot;the followers of Marx re-interpreted both the theory and the evidence in order to make them agree. ... They thus gave a &#x27;conventionalist twist&#x27; to the theory; and by this stratagem, they destroyed its much advertised claim to scientific status.&quot; Popper&#x27;s attacks were not directed toward Marxism, or Marx&#x27;s theories, which were falsifiable, but toward Marxists who he considered to have ignored the falsifications which had happened. Popper more fundamentally criticized &#x27;historicism&#x27; in the sense of any preordained prediction of history, given what he saw as our right, ability and responsibility to control our own destiny.

===Use in courts of law===

Falsifiability has been used in the &quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot; case (in 1982), the &quot;Daubert&quot; case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 found that &quot;[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert&#x27;s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.&quot;

====&quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot; case====

In the ruling of the &quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot; case, Judge William Overton used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that &quot;creation science&quot; was not scientific and should not be taught in Arkansas public schools as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher Michael Ruse defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see , and ):
* It is guided by natural law;
* It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;
* It is testable against the empirical world;
* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and
* It is falsifiable.
In his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that: 

====Daubert standard====
In several cases of the United States Supreme Court, the court described scientific methodology using the five Daubert factors, which include falsifiability. The Daubert result cited Popper and other philosophers of science: 

David H. Kaye said that references to the Daubert majority opinion confused falsifiability and falsification and that &quot;inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations.&quot;

==Connections between statistical theories and falsifiability==

Considering the specific detection procedure that was used in the neutrino experiment, without mentioning its probabilistic aspect, Popper wrote &quot;it provided a test of the much more significant &quot;falsifiable&quot; theory that such emitted neutrinos could be trapped in a certain way&quot;. In this manner, in his discussion of the neutrino experiment, Popper did not raise at all the probabilistic aspect of the experiment. Together with Maxwell, who raised the problems of falsification in the experiment, he was aware that some convention must be adopted to fix what it means to detect or not a neutrino in this probabilistic context. This is the third kind of decisions mentioned by Lakatos. For Popper and most philosophers, observations are theory impregnated. In this example, the theory that impregnates observations (and justifies that we conventionally accept the potential falsifier &quot;no neutrino was detected&quot;) is statistical. In statistical language, the potential falsifier that can be statistically accepted (not rejected to say it more correctly) is typically the null hypothesis, as understood even in popular accounts on falsifiability.

Different ways are used by statisticians to draw conclusions about hypotheses on the basis of available evidence. Fisher, Neyman and Pearson proposed approaches that require no prior probabilities on the hypotheses that are being studied. In contrast, Bayesian inference emphasizes the importance of prior probabilities. But, as far as falsification as a yes/no procedure in Popper&#x27;s methodology is concerned, any approach that provides a way to accept or not a potential falsifier can be used, including approaches that use Bayes&#x27; theorem and estimations of prior probabilities that are made using critical discussions and reasonable assumptions taken from the background knowledge. There is no general rule that considers as falsified an hypothesis with small Bayesian revised probability, because as pointed out by Mayo and argued before by Popper, the individual outcomes described in detail will easily have very small probabilities under available evidence without being genuine anomalies. Nevertheless, Mayo adds, &quot;they can indirectly falsify hypotheses by adding a methodological falsification rule&quot;. In general, Bayesian statistic can play a role in critical rationalism in the context of inductive logic, which is said to be inductive because implications are generalized to conditional probabilities. According to Popper and other philosophers such as Colin Howson, Hume&#x27;s argument precludes inductive logic, but only when the logic makes no use &quot;of additional assumptions: in particular, about what is to be assigned positive prior probability&quot;. Inductive logic itself is not precluded, especially not when it is a deductively valid application of Bayes&#x27; theorem that is used to evaluate the probabilities of the hypotheses using the observed data and what is assumed about the priors. Gelman and Shalizi mentioned that Bayes&#x27; statisticians do not have to disagree with the non-inductivists.

Because statisticians often associate statistical inference with induction, Popper&#x27;s philosophy is often said to have a hidden form of induction. For example, Mayo wrote &quot;The falsifying hypotheses ... necessitate an evidence-transcending (inductive) statistical inference. This is hugely problematic for Popper&quot;. Yet, also according to Mayo, Popper [as a non-inductivist] acknowledged the useful role of statistical inference in the falsification problems: she mentioned that Popper wrote her (in the context of falsification based on evidence) &quot;I regret not studying statistics&quot; and that her thought was then &quot;not as much as I do&quot;.

==Lakatos&#x27;s falsificationism==

Imre Lakatos divided the problems of falsification in two categories. The first category corresponds to decisions that must be agreed upon by scientists before they can falsify a theory. The other category emerges when one tries to use falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science. Lakatos described four kind of falsificationisms in view of how they address these problems. Dogmatic falsificationism ignores both types of problems. Methodological falsificationism addresses the first type of problems by accepting that decisions must be taken by scientists. Naive methodological falsificationism or naive falsificationism does not do anything to address the second type of problems. Lakatos used dogmatic and naive falsificationism to explain how Popper&#x27;s philosophy changed over time and viewed sophisticated falsificationism as his own improvement on Popper&#x27;s philosophy, but also said that Popper some times appears as a sophisticated falsificationist. Popper responded that Lakatos misrepresented his intellectual history with these terminological distinctions.

===Dogmatic falsificationism===

A dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory-impregnated. Being theory-impregnated means that it goes beyond direct experience. For example, the statement &quot;Here is a glass of water&quot; goes beyond experience, because the concepts of glass and water &quot;denote physical bodies which exhibit a certain law-like behaviour&quot; (Popper). This leads to the critique that it is unclear which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation? This is sometimes called the &#x27;Duhem–Quine problem&#x27;. An example is Galileo&#x27;s refutation of the theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. Another example is the theory that neutrinos are emitted in beta decays. Had they not been observed in the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment, many would have considered that the strength of the beta-inverse reaction used to detect the neutrinos was not sufficiently high. At the time, wrote, the possibility that this strength was sufficiently high was a &quot;pious hope&quot;.

A dogmatic falsificationist ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses. The assumptions or auxiliary hypotheses of a particular test are all the hypotheses that are assumed to be accurate in order for the test to work as planned. The predicted observation that is contradicted depends on the theory and these auxiliary hypotheses. Again, this leads to the critique that it cannot be told if it is the theory or one of the required auxiliary hypotheses that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton&#x27;s law, we will not know if it is Newton&#x27;s law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.

Lakatos says that Popper&#x27;s solution to these criticisms requires that one relaxes the assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false: 

Methodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a &quot;contradicting observation&quot; accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies four kinds of decisions that have these respective goals: the selection of all &quot;basic statements&quot; (statements that correspond to logically possible observations), selection of the &quot;accepted basic statements&quot; among the basic statements, making statistical laws falsifiable and applying the refutation to the specific theory (instead of an auxiliary hypothesis). The experimental falsifiers and falsifications thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory.

===Naive falsificationism===

According to Lakatos, naive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how scientific knowledge progresses. Very often a theory is still useful and used even after it is found in contradiction with some observations. Also, when scientists deal with two or more competing theories which are both corroborated, considering only falsifications, it is not clear why one theory is chosen above the other, even when one is corroborated more often than the other. In fact, a stronger version of the Quine-Duhem thesis says that it is not always possible to rationally pick one theory over the other using falsifications. Considering only falsifications, it is not clear why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper&#x27;s critical rationalism uses both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science. How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.

Popper distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories and accepted basic statements emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated. The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations could be justified using some kind of formal logic. It is a delicate question, because this logic would be inductive: it justifies a universal law in view of instances. Also, falsifications, because they are based on methodological decisions, are useless in a strict justification perspective. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should. In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favour theories that are corroborated over those that are falsified, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.

Popper&#x27;s way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of verisimilitude, a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to describe a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science. Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.

===From the problem of induction to falsificationism===

Hume explained induction with a theory of the mind that was in part inspired by Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation. Popper rejected Hume&#x27;s explanation of induction and proposed his own mechanism: science progresses by trial and error within an evolutionary epistemology. Hume believed that his psychological induction process follows laws of nature, but, for him, this does not imply the existence of a method of justification based on logical rules. In fact, he argued that any induction mechanism, including the mechanism described by his theory, could not be justified logically. Similarly, Popper adopted an evolutionary epistemology, which implies that some laws explain progress in science, but yet insists that the process of trial and error is hardly rigorous and that there is always an element of irrationality in the creative process of science. The absence of a method of justification is a built-in aspect of Popper&#x27;s trial and error explanation.

As rational as they can be, these explanations that refer to laws, but cannot be turned into methods of justification (and thus do not contradict Hume&#x27;s argument or its premises), were not sufficient for some philosophers. In particular, Russell once expressed the view that if Hume&#x27;s problem cannot be solved, “there is no intellectual difference between sanity and insanity” and actually proposed a method of justification. He rejected Hume&#x27;s premise that there is a need to justify any principle that is itself used to justify induction. It might seem that this premise is hard to reject, but to avoid circular reasoning we do reject it in the case of deductive logic. It makes sense to also reject this premise in the case of principles to justify induction. Lakatos&#x27;s proposal of sophisticated falsificationism was very natural in that context.

Therefore, Lakatos urged Popper to find an inductive principle behind the trial and error learning process and sophisticated falsificationism was his own approach to address this challenge. Kuhn, Feyerabend, Musgrave and others mentioned and Lakatos himself acknowledged that, as a method of justification, this attempt failed, because there was no normative methodology to justify—Lakatos&#x27;s methodology was anarchy in disguise.

===Falsificationism in Popper&#x27;s philosophy===

Popper&#x27;s philosophy is sometimes said to fail to recognize the Quine-Duhem thesis, which would make it a form of dogmatic falsificationism. For example, Watkins wrote &quot;apparently forgetting that he had once said &#x27;Duhem is right [...]&#x27;, Popper set out to devise potential falsifiers just for Newton&#x27;s fundamental assumptions&quot;. But, Popper&#x27;s philosophy is not always qualified of falsificationism in the pejorative manner associated with dogmatic or naive falsificationism. The problems of falsification are acknowledged by the falsificationists. For example, Chalmers points out that falsificationists freely admit that observation is theory impregnated. Thornton, referring to Popper&#x27;s methodology, says that the predictions inferred from conjectures are not directly compared with the facts simply because all observation-statements are theory-laden. For the critical rationalists, the problems of falsification are not an issue, because they do not try to make experimental falsifications logical or to logically justify them, nor to use them to logically explain progress in science. Instead, their faith rests on critical discussions around these experimental falsifications. Lakatos made a distinction between a &quot;falsification&quot; (with quotation marks) in Popper&#x27;s philosophy and a falsification (without quotation marks) that can be used in a systematic methodology where rejections are justified. He knew that Popper&#x27;s philosophy is not and has never been about this kind of justification, but he felt that it should have been. Sometimes, Popper and other falsificationists say that when a theory is falsified it is rejected, which appears as dogmatic falsificationism, but the general context is always critical rationalism in which all decisions are open to critical discussions and can be revised.

==Controversies==
===Methodless creativity versus inductive methodology===
As described in section , Lakatos and Popper agreed that universal laws cannot be logically deduced (except from laws that say even more). But unlike Popper, Lakatos felt that if the explanation for new laws cannot be deductive, it must be inductive. He urged Popper explicitly to adopt some inductive principle and sets himself the task to find an inductive methodology. However, the methodology that he found did not offer any exact inductive rules. In a response to Kuhn, Feyerabend and Musgrave, Lakatos acknowledged that the methodology depends on the good judgment of the scientists. Feyerabend wrote in &quot;Against Method&quot; that Lakatos&#x27;s methodology of scientific research programmes is epistemological anarchism in disguise and Musgrave made a similar comment. In more recent work, Feyerabend says that Lakatos uses rules, but whether or not to follow any of these rules is left to the judgment of the scientists. This is also discussed elsewhere.

Popper also offered a methodology with rules, but these rules are also not-inductive rules, because they are not by themselves used to accept laws or establish their validity. They do that through the creativity or &quot;good judgment&quot; of the scientists only. For Popper, the required non deductive component of science never had to be an inductive methodology. He always viewed this component as a creative process beyond the explanatory reach of any rational methodology, but yet used to decide which theories should be studied and applied, find good problems and guess useful conjectures. Quoting Einstein to support his view, Popper said that this renders obsolete the need for an inductive methodology or logical path to the laws. For Popper, no inductive methodology was ever proposed to satisfactorily explain science.

===Ahistorical versus historiographical===
Section says that both Lakatos&#x27;s and Popper&#x27;s methodology are not inductive. Yet Lakatos&#x27;s methodology extended importantly Popper&#x27;s methodology: it added a historiographical component to it. This allowed Lakatos to find corroborations for his methodology in the history of science. The basic units in his methodology, which can be abandoned or pursued, are research programmes. Research programmes can be degenerative or progressive and only degenerative research programmes must be abandoned at some point. For Lakatos, this is mostly corroborated by facts in history.

In contradistinction, Popper did not propose his methodology as a tool to reconstruct the history of science. Yet, some times, he did refer to history to corroborate his methodology. For example, he remarked that theories that were considered great successes were also the most likely to be falsified. Zahar&#x27;s view was that, with regard to corroborations found in the history of science, there was only a difference of emphasis between Popper and Lakatos.

As an anecdotal example, in one of his articles Lakatos challenged Popper to show that his theory was falsifiable: he asked &quot;Under what conditions would you give up your demarcation criterion?&quot;. Popper replied &quot;I shall give up my theory if Professor Lakatos succeeds in showing that Newton&#x27;s theory is no more falsifiable by &#x27;observable states of affairs&#x27; than is Freud&#x27;s.&quot; According to David Stove, Lakatos succeeded, since Lakatos showed there is no such thing as a &quot;non-Newtonian&quot; behaviour of an observable object. Stove argued that Popper&#x27;s counterexamples to Lakatos were either instances of begging the question, such as Popper&#x27;s example of missiles moving in a &quot;non-Newtonian track&quot;, or consistent with Newtonian physics, such as objects not falling to the ground without &quot;obvious&quot; countervailing forces against Earth&#x27;s gravity.

===Normal science versus revolutionary science===
Thomas Kuhn analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper&#x27;s view is that only revolutions are relevant. For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge, is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought, Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which represent some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It is only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section ). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory. Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.

===Unfalsifiability versus falsity of astrology===
Popper often uses astrology as an example of a pseudoscience. He says that it is not falsifiable because both the theory itself and its predictions are too imprecise. Kuhn, as a historian of science, remarked that many predictions made by astrologers in the past were quite precise and they were very often falsified. He also said that astrologers themselves acknowledged these falsifications.

===Epistemological anarchism vs the scientific method===
Paul Feyerabend rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos&#x27;s argument for &quot;ad hoc&quot; hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method. He said that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, epistemological anarchism or &quot;anything goes&quot; would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have, derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.

===Sokal and Bricmont===

In their book &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot; (from 1997, published in the UK as &quot;Intellectual Impostures&quot;) the physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont criticised falsifiability. They include this critique in the &quot;Intermezzo&quot; chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism. Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper&#x27;s description of falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.

<text> (, &quot;Free Corps&quot; or &quot;Volunteer Corps&quot;) were irregular German and other European paramilitary volunteer units that existed from the 18th to the early 20th centuries. They effectively fought as mercenaries or private military companies, regardless of their own nationality. In German-speaking countries, the first so-called (&quot;free regiments&quot;, &quot;Freie Regimenter&quot;) were formed in the 18th century from native volunteers, enemy renegades, and deserters. These sometimes exotically equipped units served as infantry and cavalry (or, more rarely, as artillery); sometimes in just company strength and sometimes in formations of up to several thousand strong. There were also various mixed formations or legions. The Prussian included infantry, jäger, dragoons and hussars. The French &quot;Volontaires de Saxe&quot; combined uhlans and dragoons.

In the aftermath of World War I and during the German Revolution of 1918–19, , consisting partially of World War I veterans, were raised as paramilitary militias. They were ostensibly mustered to fight on behalf of the government against the German communists attempting to overthrow the Weimar Republic. However, many also largely despised the Republic and were involved in assassinations of its supporters, later aiding the Nazis in their rise to power.

== Origins ==
The first appeared during the War of the Austrian Succession and especially during the Seven Years&#x27; War, when France, Prussia, and the Habsburg monarchy embarked on an escalation of petty warfare while conserving their regular regiments. Even during the last Kabinettskrieg, the War of the Bavarian Succession, formations were formed in 1778. Germans, Hungarians, Poles, Lithuanians, and South Slavs, as well as Turks, Tatars and Cossacks, were believed by all warring parties to be inherently good fighters. The nationality of many soldiers can no longer be ascertained as the ethnic origin was often described imprecisely in the regimental lists. Slavs (Croats, Serbs) were often referred to as &quot;Hungarians&quot; or just &quot;Croats&quot;, and Muslim recruits (Albanians, Bosnians, Tatars) as &quot;Turks&quot;.

Inspired by the Slavic troops in Austrian service, France, the Dutch Republic and other nations began employing &quot;Free Troops&quot;, usually consisting of infantry and cavalry units. The Dutch Republic employed a number of &quot;Vrij compagnieën&quot;(Free Companies), raised between 1745 and 1747 and made up of volunteers and French deserters, such as the Walloon Grenadier Company. Although mostly used for reconnaissance and harassing enemy columns, the companies were organised into a battalion and engaged at the engagement at Wouw and the Battle of Lauffelt. Some companies were accompanied by a company of Dragons or Hussars, such as Roodt&#x27;s Company and Cornabé&#x27;s Legion. And in late 1747, a French company of Miners was captured and taken into service of the Republic. 

France also made extensive use of Free Companies and Legions. At the Battle of Fontenoy, deployment of the British attack column was hampered by the French &#x27;Harquebusiers de Grassins&#x27;. After the Battle of Lauffelt, French light troops pursued the retreating allies, but were engaged in a bloody guerilla war with Austrian and Dutch light troops and Free Companies for the remainder of the campaign. 

For Prussia, the Pandurs, who were made up of Croats and Serbs, were a clear model for the organization of such &quot;free&quot; troops. On 15 July 1759, Frederick the Great ordered the creation of a squadron of volunteer hussars to be attached to the 1st Hussar Regiment (von Kleist&#x27;s Own). He entrusted the creation and command of this new unit to Colonel Friedrich Wilhelm von Kleist. This first squadron (80 men) was raised in Dresden and consisted mainly of Hungarian deserters. This squadron was placed under the command of Lieutenant Johann Michael von Kovacs. At the end of 1759, the first four squadrons of dragoons (also called horse grenadiers) of the were organised. They initially consisted of Prussian volunteers from Berlin, Magdeburg, Mecklenburg and Leipzig, but later recruited deserters. The were regarded as unreliable by regular armies, so they were used mainly as sentries and for minor duties.. During the war, 14 &quot;free infantry&quot; () units were created, mainly between 1756 and 1758, which were intended to be attractive to those soldiers who wanted military &quot;adventure&quot;, but did not want to have to do military drill. A distinction should be made between the formed up to 1759 for the final years of the war, which operated independently and disrupted the enemy with surprise attacks, and the free infantry which consisted of various military branches (such as infantry, hussars, dragoons, &quot;jäger&quot;) and were used in combination. They were often used to ward off Maria Theresa&#x27;s Pandurs. In the era of linear tactics, light troops had been seen necessary for outpost, reinforcement and reconnaissance duties. During the war, eight such volunteer corps were set up:
* Trümbach&#x27;s (Voluntaires de Prusse) (FI)
* Kleist&#x27;s (FII)
* Glasenapp&#x27;s Free Dragoons (F III)
* Schony&#x27;s (F IV)
* Gschray&#x27;s (F V)
* Bauer&#x27;s Free Hussars (F VI)
* Légion Britannique (FV – of the Electorate of Hanover)
* Volontaires Auxiliaires (F VI).

Because, some exceptions, they were seen as undisciplined and less battleworthy, they were used for less onerous guard and garrison duties. In the so-called &quot;petty wars&quot;, the interdicted enemy supply lines with guerrilla warfare. In the case of capture, their members were at risk of being executed as irregular fighters. In Prussia the , which Frederick the Great had despised as &quot;vermin&quot;, were disbanded. Their soldiers were given no entitlement to pensions or invalidity payments.

In France, many corps continued to exist until 1776. They were attached to regular dragoon regiments as &quot;jäger&quot; squadrons. During the Napoleonic Wars, Austria recruited various of Slavic origin. The Slavonic Wurmser fought in Alsace. The combat effectiveness of the six Viennese (37,000 infantrymen and cavalrymen), however, was low. An exception were the border regiments of Croats and Serbs who served permanently on the Austro-Ottoman border.

== Napoleonic era ==
During Napoleon&#x27;s 1812 invasion of Russia, the hussar Denis Davydov, a warrior-poet, formed volunteer partisan detachments functioning as &quot;Freikorps&quot; during the French retreat from Moscow. These irregular units operated in conjunction with Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov&#x27;s regular Russian Imperial Army and Ataman Matvei Platov&#x27;s Cossack detachments, harassing the French supply lines and inflicting defeats on the retreating Grande Armée in the battles of Krasnoi and the Berezina.

 in the modern sense emerged in Germany during the course of the Napoleonic Wars. They fought not so much for money but for patriotic reasons, seeking to shake off the French Confederation of the Rhine. After the French under Emperor Napoleon had either conquered the German states or forced them to collaborate, remnants of the defeated armies continued to fight on in this fashion. Famous formations included the King&#x27;s German Legion, who had fought for Britain in French-occupied Spain and mainly were recruited from Hanoverians, the Lützow Free Corps and the Black Brunswickers.

The attracted many nationally disposed citizens and students. commanders such as Ferdinand von Schill, Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow or Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, known as the &quot;Black Duke&quot;, led their own attacks on Napoleonic occupation forces in Germany. Those led by Schill were decimated in the Battle of Stralsund (1809); many were killed in battle or executed at Napoleon&#x27;s command in the aftermath. The were very popular during the period of the German War of Liberation (1813–15), during which von Lützow, a survivor of Schill&#x27;s , formed his Lützow Free Corps. The anti-Napoleonic often operated behind French lines as a kind of commando or guerrilla force.

Throughout the 19th century, these anti-Napoleonic were greatly praised and glorified by German nationalists, and a heroic myth built up around their exploits. This myth was invoked, in considerably different circumstances, in the aftermath of Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I.

=== Freikorps poetry ===
The anti-Napoleonic guerrilla movements in Germany, Russia and Spain in the early 1810s also produced their own style of poetry, &quot;hussar poetry&quot; or &quot;Freikorps poetry&quot;, written by soldier-poets. In Germany, Theodor Körner, Max von Schenkendorff and Ernst Moritz Arndt were the most famous soldier-poets from the Freikorps. Their lyrics were for the most part patriotic, republican, anti-monarchical and anti-French. In Russia, the leader of the guerrilla army, Davydov, invented the genre of hussar poetry, characterised by hedonism and bravado. He used events from his own life to illustrate such poetry. Later, when Mikhail Lermontov was a &quot;junker&quot; (cadet) in the Russian Imperial Army, he also wrote such poetry.

== 1815–71 ==

Even in the aftermath of the Napoleonic era, were set up with varying degrees of success. During the March 1848 riots, student were set up in Munich.

In First Schleswig War of 1848 the of &quot;von der Tann&quot;, &quot;Zastrow&quot; and others distinguished themselves.

In 1864 in Mexico, the French formed the so-called &quot;Contreguerrillas&quot; under former Prussian hussar officer, Milson. In Italy, Giuseppe Garibaldi formed his famous &quot;Freischars&quot;, notably the &quot;Thousand of Marsala&quot;, which landed in Sicily in 1860.

Even before the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71, were developed in France that were known as franc-tireurs.

== Post–World War I ==

After World War I, the meaning of the word Freikorps changed compared to its past iterations. After 1918, the term referred to various—yet, still, loosely affiliated—paramilitary organizations that were established in Germany following the defeat in World War I. Of the numerous Weimar paramilitary groups active during that time, the Freikorps were, and remain, the most notable. While numbers are difficult to determine, historians agree that some 500,000 men were formal Freikorps members with another 1.5 million men participating informally.

Amongst the social, political, and economic upheavals that marked the early years of the Weimar Republic, the tenuous German government under Friedrich Ebert, leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (, SPD), used the Freikorps to quell socialist and communist uprisings. Minister of Defence and SPD member Gustav Noske also relied on the Freikorps to suppress the Marxist Spartacist uprising, culminating in the summary executions of revolutionary communist leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg on 15 January 1919.

=== Freikorps involvement in Germany and Eastern Europe ===
==== Bavarian Soviet Republic ====
The Bavarian Soviet Republic was a short-lived and unrecognized socialist-communist state from 12 April – 3 May 1919 in Bavaria during the German Revolution of 1918–19. Following a series of political revolts and takeovers from German socialists and then Russian-backed Bolsheviks, Noske responded from Berlin by sending various Freikorps brigades to Bavaria in late April totalling some 30,000 men. The brigades included Hermann Ehrhardt&#x27;s second Marine Brigade Freikorps, the Gorlitz Freikorps under Lieutenant Colonel Faupel, and two Swabian divisions from Württemberg under General Haas and Major Hirl as well as the largest Freikorps in Bavaria commanded by Colonel Franz Ritter von Epp.

While they were met with little Communist resistance, the Freikorps acted with particular brutality and violence under Noske&#x27;s blessing and at the behest of Major Schulz, adjutant of the Lützow Freikorps, who reminded his men that it &quot;[was] a lot better to kill a few innocent people than to let one guilty person escape&quot; and that there was no place in his ranks for those whose conscience bothered them. On 5 May 1919, Lieutenant Georg Pölzing, one of Schulz&#x27;s officers, travelled to the town of Perlach outside of Munich. There, Pölzing chose a dozen alleged communist workers—none of whom were actually communists, but members of the Social Democratic Party—and shot them on the spot. The following day, a Freikorps patrol led by Captain Alt-Sutterheim interrupted the meeting of a local Catholic club, the St Joseph Society, and chose twenty of the thirty members present to be shot, beaten, and bayoneted to death. A memorial on Pfanzeltplatz in Munich commemorates the incident. Historian Nigel Jones notes that as a result of the Freikorps&#x27; violence, Munich&#x27;s undertakers were overwhelmed, resulting in bodies lying in the streets and decaying until mass graves were completed.

==== Eastern Europe ====
The Freikorps also fought against communists and Bolsheviks in Eastern Europe, most notably East Prussia, Latvia, Silesia, and Poland. The Freikorps demonstrated fervent anti-Slavic racism and viewed Slavs and Bolsheviks as &quot;sub-human&quot; hordes of &quot;ravening wolves&quot;. To justify their campaign in the East, the Freikorps launched a campaign of propaganda that falsely positioned themselves as protectors of Germany&#x27;s territorial hegemony over Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia as a result of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and as defenders against Slavic and Bolshevik hordes that &quot;raped women and butchered children&quot; in their wake. Historian Nigel Jones highlights the Freikorps&#x27;s &quot;usual excesses&quot; of violence and murder in Latvia which were all the more unrestrained since they were fighting in a foreign land versus their own country. Hundreds were murdered in the Freikorps&#x27; Eastern campaigns, such as the massacre of 500 Latvian civilians suspected of harbouring Bolshevik sympathies or the capture of Riga which saw the Freikorps slaughter some 3,000 people. Summary executions via firing squads were most common, but several Freikorps members recorded the brutal and deadly beatings of suspected communists and particularly communist women.

=== Freikorps identity and ideals ===
Freikorps ranks were composed primarily of former World War I soldiers who, upon demobilization, were unable to reintegrate into civilian society having been brutalized by the violence of the war physically and mentally. Combined with the government&#x27;s poor support of veterans, who were dismissed as hysterical when suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, many German veterans found comfort and a sense of belonging in the Freikorps. Jason Crouthamel notes how the Freikorps&#x27; military structure was a familiar continuation of the frontlines, emulating the &quot;Kampfgemeinschaft&quot; (battle community) and &quot;Kameradschaft&quot; (camaraderie), thus preserving &quot;the heroic spirit of comradeship in the trenches&quot;. Others, angry at Germany&#x27;s sudden, seemingly inexplicable defeat, joined the Freikorps to fight against communism and socialism in Germany or to exact some form of revenge on those they considered responsible. To a lesser extent, German youth who were not old enough to have served in World War I enlisted in the Freikorps in hopes of proving themselves as patriots and as men.

Regardless of reasons for joining, modern German historians agree that men of the Freikorps consistently embodied post-Enlightenment masculine ideals that are characterized by &quot;physical, emotional, and moral &#x27;hardness&#x27;&quot;. Described as &quot;children of the trenches, spawned by war&quot; and its process of brutalization, historians argue that Freikorps men idealized a militarized masculinity of aggression, physical domination, the absence of emotion (hardness). They were to be as &quot;swift as greyhounds, tough as leather, [and] hard as Krupp steel&quot; so as to defend what remained of German conservatism in times of social chaos, confusion, and revolution that came to define the immediate interwar era. Although World War I ended in Germany&#x27;s surrender, many men in the Freikorps nonetheless viewed themselves as soldiers still engaged in active warfare with enemies of the traditional German Empire such as communists and Bolsheviks, Jews, socialists, and pacifists. Prominent Freikorps member Ernst von Salomon described his troops as &quot;full of wild demand for revenge and action and adventure...a band of fighter...full of lust, exultant in anger.&quot;

In 1977, German sociologist Klaus Theweleit published &quot;Male Fantasies,&quot; in which he argues that men in the Freikorps radicalized Western and German norms of male self-control into a perpetual war against feminine-coded desires for domesticity, tenderness, and compassion amongst men. Historians Nigel Jones and Thomas Kühne note that the Freikorps&#x27; displays of violence, terror, and male aggression and solidarity established the beginnings of the fascist New Man upon which the Nazis built.

=== Demobilization ===
The extent of the Freikorps&#x27; involvement and actions in Eastern Europe, where they demonstrated full autonomy and rejected orders from the Reichswehr and German government, left a negative impression with the state. By this time, the Freikorps had served Ebert&#x27;s purpose of suppressing revolts and communist uprisings. After the failed Kapp-Lütwitz Putsch in March 1920 that the Freikorps participated in, the Freikorps&#x27; autonomy and strength steadily declined as Hans von Seeckt, commander of the Reichswehr, removed all Freikorps members from the army and restricted the movements&#x27; access to future funding and equipment from the government. Von Seeckt was successful, and by 1921 only a small yet devoted core remained, effectively drawing an end to the Freikorps until their resurgence as far-right thugs and street brawlers for the Nazis beginning in 1923.

=== Affiliation with the Nazi Party ===
The rise of the Nazi Party led to a resurgence of Freikorps activity, as many members or ex-members were drawn to the party&#x27;s marrying of military and political life and extreme nationalism by joining the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) and &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). Unlike in the German Revolution of 1918–19 or their involvement in Eastern Europe, the Freikorps now had almost no military value and were instead utilized by the Nazis as thugs to engage in street brawls with communists and to break up anarchist, communist and socialist meetings alongside the SA to gain a political edge. Moreover, the Nazis elevated the Freikorps as a symbol of pure German nationalism, anti-communism, and militarized masculinity to co-opt the lingering social and political support of the movement.

Eventually, Adolf Hitler came to view the Freikorps as a nuisance and possible threat to his consolidation of power. During the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, an internal purge of Hitler&#x27;s enemies within the Nazi Party, numerous Freikorps members and leaders were targeted for killing or arrest, including Freikorps commander Hermann Ehrhardt and SA leader Ernst Röhm. In Hitler&#x27;s Reichstag speech following the purge, Hitler denounced the Freikorps as lawless &quot;moral degenerates...aimed at the destruction of all existing institutions&quot; and as &quot;pathological enemies of the state...[and] enemies of all authority,&quot; despite his previous public adoration of the movement.

=== Nazi legacy ===
Numerous future members and leaders of the Nazi Party served in the Freikorps. Martin Bormann, eventual head of the Nazi Party Chancellery and Private Secretary to Hitler, joined Gerhard Roßbach&#x27;s Freikorps in Mecklenburg as a section leader and quartermaster. Reich Farmers&#x27; Leader and Minister of Food and Agriculture Richard Walther Darré was part of the Berlin Freikorps. Reinhard Heydrich, future chief of the Reich Security Main Office (including the Gestapo, Kripo, and SD) and initiator of the Final Solution, was in Georg Ludwig Rudolf Maercker&#x27;s Freikorps as a teenager. Leader of the SS Heinrich Himmler enlisted in the Freikorps and carried a flag in the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch. Rudolf Höss joined the East Prussian Volunteer Freikorps in 1919 and eventually became commander of the Auschwitz extermination camp. Ernst Röhm, eventual leader of the SA, supported various Bavarian Freikorps groups, funnelling them arms and cash. Although many high-ranking National Socialists were former Freikorps fighters, recent research shows that former Freikorps fighters were no more likely to be involved in National Socialist organisations than the average male population in Germany.

==World War II==

During World War II, there existed certain armed groups loyal to Germany that went under the name &quot;Freikorps&quot;. These include:
* Sudetendeutsches Freikorps, a German nationalist paramilitary that fought against Czechoslovakia for annexation of the Sudetenland into Germany.
* Free Corps Denmark, a Danish volunteer collaborationist group in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; that was founded by the National Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of Denmark, and participated in the invasion of the Soviet Union.
* British Free Corps, a &quot;Waffen-SS unit&quot; made up of former British Commonwealth prisoners of war.
* Freikorps Sauerland

==Use in other countries==
===France===
In France, a similar group (but unrelated to the Freikorps) were the &quot;Corps Franc&quot;. Starting in October 1939, the French Army raised a number of Corps Franc units with the mission of carrying out ambush, raid, and harassing operations forward of the Maginot Line during the period known as the Phoney War (Drôle de Guerre). They were tasked with attacking German troops guarding the Siegfried Line. Future Vichy collaborationist, Anti-Bolshevik and SS Major Joseph Darnand was one of the more famous participants in these commando actions.

In May 1940, the experience of the Phoney War-era Corps Franc was an influence in creating the Groupes Francs Motorisé de Cavalerie (GFC) who played a storied role in the delaying operations and last stands of the Battle of France, notably in the defenses of the Seine and the Loire. Between April – September 1944, the Corps Franc de la Montagne Noire unit operated as part of the French Resistance.

==== Corps Francs d&#x27;Afrique ====
On 25 November 1942, in the immediate aftermath of the Allied Invasion of Vichy French North Africa the Corps Francs d&#x27;Afrique (CFA) (African Corps Franc) was raised in French Morocco within the Free French Forces by General Giraud. Giraud drew the members of the all-volunteer unit from residents of Northern Africa of diverse religious backgrounds (Christian, Jew, and Muslim) and gave them the title of &quot;Vélite&quot;, a name inspired by the elite light infantry of Napoleon&#x27;s Imperial Guard, who were named after the Roman Velites. Much of the Corps was drawn from Henri d&#x27;Astier de la Vigerie and José Aboulker&#x27;s Géo Gras French Resistance Group which had been responsible for the Algiers Insurrection where the Resistance seized control of Algiers on the night of 8 November 1942 in coordination with the Allied landings happening that same night. In taking over Algiers, they managed to capture both Admiral Darlan and General Juin, which led to the Darlan Deal wherein Vichy French forces came over to the Allied side. Darlan was later assassinated by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, an early member of the Corps Francs d&#x27;Afrique. They functioned as the Free French equivalent to the British Commandos. The Corps also included many Spanish and International old combatants of the Spanish Republican Army, which had sought refuge in Northern Africa in 1939.

The Corps Francs d&#x27;Afrique, under command of Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert, went on to fight Rommel&#x27;s Afrikakorps in Tunisia with the U.S. 5th Army. They fought alongside the British 139th Brigade at Kassarine and Sidi Nasr, where they famously conducted a heroic bayonet charge, facing two to one odds, against the Italian 34th Battalion of the 10th Bersaglieri near the mountain of Kef Zilia on the road to Bizerte, taking 380 prisoners, killing the Italian battalion commander, and capturing the plans for Operation Ausladung. They participated in the capture of Bizerte in May 1943.

For its actions, the Corps Franc d&#x27;Afrique was awarded the Croix de Guerre.

The CFA formally was dissolved on 9 July 1943, with its members and equipment forming the corps of the newly created African Commando Group (GCA) on 13 July 1943 in Dupleix, Algeria, today seen as a forebear to the postwar Parachutist Shock Battalions and the modern day 13th RDP. The GCA went on to fight at Pianosa, Elba, Salerno, Provence, Belfort, Giromagny, Alsace, Cernay, Guebwiller, Buhl, and the Invasion of Germany.

<text>Francisco Ignacio Madero González (; 30 October 1873 – 22 February 1913) was a Mexican businessman, revolutionary, writer and statesman, who served as the 37th president of Mexico from 1911 until he was deposed in a coup d&#x27;état in February 1913 and assassinated. He came to prominence as an advocate for democracy and as an opponent of President and &quot;de facto&quot; dictator Porfirio Díaz. After Díaz claimed to have won the fraudulent election of 1910 despite promising a return to democracy, Madero started the Mexican Revolution to oust Díaz. The Mexican revolution would continue until 1920, well after Madero and Díaz&#x27;s deaths, with hundreds of thousands dead.

A member of one of Mexico&#x27;s wealthiest families, Madero studied business at the École des Hautes Études Commerciales de Paris. An advocate for social justice and democracy, his 1908 book &quot;The Presidential Succession in 1910&quot; called Mexican voters to prevent the reelection of Porfirio Díaz, whose regime had become increasingly authoritarian. Bankrolling the opposition Anti-Reelectionist Party, Madero&#x27;s candidacy garnered widespread support in the country. He challenged Díaz in the 1910 election, which resulted in his arrest. After Díaz declared himself winner for an eighth term in a rigged election, Madero escaped from jail, fled to the United States, and called for the overthrow of his regime in the Plan of San Luis Potosí, sparking the Mexican Revolution.

Madero&#x27;s armed support was concentrated in northern Mexico and was aided by access to arms and finances in the United States. In Chihuahua, Madero recruited wealthy landowner Abraham González to his movement, appointing him provisional governor of the state. González then enlisted Pancho Villa and Pascual Orozco as revolutionary leaders. Madero crossed from Texas into Mexico and took command of a band of revolutionaries, but was defeated in the Battle of Casas Grandes by the Federal Army, which led him to abandon military command roles. Concerned the Battle of Ciudad Juárez would cause casualties in the American city of El Paso and prompt foreign intervention, Madero ordered Villa and Orozco to retreat, but they disobeyed and captured Juárez. Díaz resigned on 25 May 1911 after the signing of the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez and went into exile. Madero retained the Federal Army and dismissed the revolutionary fighters who had forced Díaz&#x27;s resignation.

Madero was enormously popular among many sectors but did not immediately assume the presidency. An interim president was installed, and elections were scheduled. Madero was elected in a landslide and sworn into office on 6 November 1911. The Madero administration soon encountered opposition from conservatives and more radical revolutionaries. Hesitation to implement large-scale land reform efforts upset many of his followers, who viewed it as a promised demand from conflict participation. Workers also became disillusioned by his moderate policies. Former supporter Emiliano Zapata declared himself in rebellion against Madero in the Plan of Ayala, and in the north, Pascual Orozco led an insurrection against him. Foreign investors became concerned that Madero could not maintain political stability, while foreign governments were concerned that a destabilized Mexico would threaten international order.

In February 1913, a coup d&#x27;état backed by the United States and led by conservative generals Félix Díaz (a nephew of Porfirio Díaz), Bernardo Reyes, and Victoriano Huerta was staged in Mexico City, with the latter taking the presidency. Madero was captured and assassinated along with vice president José María Pino Suárez in a series of events now called the Ten Tragic Days, where his brother Gustavo was tortured and killed. After his assassination, Madero became a unifying force among revolutionary factions against the Huerta regime. In the north, Venustiano Carranza, then governor of Coahuila, led the nascent Constitutionalist Army; meanwhile, Zapata continued his rebellion against the federal government under the Plan of Ayala. Once Huerta was ousted in July 1914, the revolutionary coalitions met in the Convention of Aguascalientes, where disagreements persisted, and Mexico entered a new stage of civil war.

==Early years (1873–1903)==
===Family background===
Francisco Ignacio Madero González was born in 1873 into a large and extremely wealthy family in northeastern Mexico at the hacienda of El Rosario, in Parras de la Fuente, Coahuila. His grandfather Evaristo Madero Elizondo had built an enormous and diversified fortune as a young man and briefly served as Governor of Coahuila, from 1880 to 1884, during the four-year interregnum of Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s rule (1880–1884), when Díaz&#x27;s right-hand man General Manuel González served as president, doing a poor job in Díaz&#x27;s opinion. Díaz returned to the presidency in 1884 and did not relinquish the office until 1911, when Francisco Madero&#x27;s revolutionary movement forced him to resign. Díaz had permanently sidelined Evaristo Madero from further political office. He was of Portuguese-Jewish descent

Evaristo was the founder of a commercial transport business. Taking advantage of economic opportunity, he transported cotton from the Confederate states to Mexican ports during the U.S. Civil War (1861–65).

Evaristo married twice, with the first marriage before he made his fortune to sixteen-year-old María Rafaela Hernádez Lombaraña (1847–1870), the daughter of an influential landowner, together producing seven children. She was the half-sister of the powerful miner and banker Antonio V. Hernández Benavides, a close friend of José Yves Limantour, Secretary of Finance. Alongside his brother-in-law and others of his new political family&#x27;s relations, Evaristo founded the &quot;Compañía Industrial de Parras&quot;, initially involved in commercial vineyards, cotton, and textiles, and later also in mining, cotton mills, ranching, banking, coal, guayule rubber, and foundries in the later part of the nineteenth century. After Rafaela Hernández&#x27;s death at age 38, Evaristo married Manuela Farías y Benavides (1870–1893), producing eleven children. She was a member of one of northern Mexico&#x27;s most influential families, daughter of Juan Francisco Farías, founder of the Rio Grande Republic. The surviving children of Evaristo&#x27;s marriages also married into prominent families and expanded the Madero family&#x27;s power and wealth.
For many years despite their exclusion from political office, the family prospered during Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s regime, and by 1910 the family was one of the richest in Mexico, worth 30 million pesos ($15 million U.S. dollars of the day, and almost $500 million U.S. dollars in today&#x27;s money). Much of this wealth arose from the diversification of Madero lands during the 1890s into the production of &quot;guayule&quot; rubber plants.

Unusually for a Mexican landowner, many of whom stayed close to home, the patriarch Evaristo traveled to Europe, as did Francisco&#x27;s father. Francisco&#x27;s father was interested in the increasingly popular philosophical movement of spiritism, founded by Allan Kardec, and subscribed to the &quot;La Revue Spirite&quot; and the Société Parisienne d&#x27;Études Spirites, whilst completing his studies at the École Commercial in Antwerp (Belgium). Back in Mexico, he hired Thomas Edison to electrify his hacienda and neighboring town of Parras. Young Francisco was sent to Paris to study business alongside his brother Gustavo and became a devotee of spiritism himself. He wrote extensively about spiritism in his diaries. &quot;He was searching for ethical connections between Spiritualism and the Christian Gospels. &#x27;I have no doubts that the moral transformation I have experienced is due to my becoming a medium.&#x27;&quot;

Francisco I. Madero was the first-born son of Evaristo&#x27;s first-born son of his first marriage, Francisco Ignacio Madero Hernández and Mercedes González Treviño, and was Evaristo&#x27;s first-born grandson. Young Francisco was the first of his father&#x27;s eleven children. This wealthy and prolific extended family could provide vast resources to young Francisco when he challenged Porfirio Díaz for the presidency in 1910. He was a sickly child and was small in stature as an adult. It is widely believed that Madero&#x27;s middle initial, I, stood for Indalecio, but according to his birth certificate it stood for Ignacio. On the birth certificate, Ignacio was written with the archaic spelling of &quot;Ygnacio&quot;.

After winning election to the presidency in 1911, Francisco confirmed his uncle Ernesto Madero Farías, from his grandfather&#x27;s second marriage, as his Minister of Finance (a post which he had since the previous presidency), which was used to accuse him of nepotism. Francisco was close to his brother Gustavo A. Madero as a trusted advisor when president. His brother Gustavo was murdered during the coup that overthrew Francisco from the presidency. His brothers Emilio, Julio, and Raúl fought in the Mexican Revolution.

Although Francisco I. Madero&#x27;s marriage to Sara Pérez was childless and there are no direct descendants of his line of the Maderos, the descendants of Evaristo Madero make up some of Mexico&#x27;s most influential families today. Thus, young Francisco was a member of an extended and powerful northern Mexican clan with a focus on commercial rather than political interests.

===Education===

Francisco and his younger brother Gustavo A. Madero attended the Jesuit college of San Juan in Saltillo and wanted to then become a Jesuit. He and his brother Gustavo briefly attended another religious school in the U.S. His English was poor, so he learned little in his short time there, and he abandoned any notion of a religious vocation.
Between 1886 and 1892, Madero was educated in France and then the United States, attending the Lycée Hoche de Versailles, HEC Paris and UC Berkeley. At the Lycée Hoche in Versailles, France, he completed the classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles program. Soon after, he was admitted to study business at the prestigious École des Hautes Études Commerciales de Paris (HEC). His father&#x27;s subscription to the magazine &quot;Revue Spirite&quot; awakened in the young Madero an interest in Spiritism, an offshoot of Spiritualism. During his time in Paris, Madero made a pilgrimage to the tomb of Allan Kardec, the founder of Spiritism, and became a passionate advocate of the belief, soon coming to believe he was a medium. Following business school, Madero studied at the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue courses in agricultural techniques and to improve his English. During his time there, he was influenced by the theosophist ideas of Annie Besant, which were prominent at nearby Stanford University.

===Return to Mexico===

In 1893, the 20-year-old Madero returned to Mexico and assumed management of one of the Madero family&#x27;s hacienda at San Pedro, Coahuila. Well-traveled and well-educated, he was now in robust health. Proving an enlightened and progressive member of the Madero commercial complex, Francisco installed new irrigation, introduced American-made cotton and cotton machinery, and built a soap factory and also an ice factory. He embarked on a lifelong commitment to philanthropy. His employees were well paid and received regular medical exams; he built schools, hospitals, and community kitchens; and he paid to support orphans and award scholarships. He also taught himself homeopathy and offered medical treatments to his employees. Francisco became increasingly engaged with Spiritism and in 1901 was convinced that the spirit of his brother Raúl, who had died at age 4, was communicating with him, urging him to do charity work and practice self-discipline and self-abnegation. Madero became a vegetarian and stopped drinking alcohol and smoking.

Already well-connected to a wealthy family and now well-educated in business, he had built a personal fortune of over 500,000 pesos by 1899. He invested in mines with other members of his family, which came to compete with interests of the Guggenheim family in Mexico. The family was organized on patriarchal principles, so that even though young Francisco was wealthy in his own right, his father and especially his grandfather Evaristo viewed him as someone who should be under the authority of his elders. As the eldest sibling, Francisco exercised authority over his younger brothers and sisters. In January 1903, he married Sara Pérez Romero, first in a civil ceremony, and then a Catholic nuptial mass celebrated by the archbishop.

==Political career==
===Introduction to politics (1903–1908)===
On 2 April 1903, Bernardo Reyes, governor of Nuevo León, violently crushed a political demonstration, an example of the increasingly authoritarian policies of president Porfirio Díaz. Madero was deeply moved and, believing himself to be receiving advice from the spirit of his late brother Raúl, he decided to act. The spirit of Raúl told him, &quot;Aspire to do good for your fellow citizens...working for a lofty ideal that will raise the moral level of society, that will succeed in liberating it from oppression, slavery, and fanaticism.&quot; Madero founded the Benito Juárez Democratic Club and ran for municipal office in 1904, though he lost the election narrowly. In addition to his political activities, Madero continued his interest in Spiritualism, publishing a number of articles under the pseudonym of Arjuna (a prince from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;).

In 1905, Madero became increasingly involved in opposition to the Díaz government, which had excluded his family from political power. He organized political clubs and founded a political newspaper (&quot;El Demócrata&quot;) and a satirical periodical (&quot;El Mosco&quot;, &quot;The Fly&quot;). Madero&#x27;s preferred candidate, Frumencio Fuentes, was defeated by that of Porfirio Díaz in Coahuila&#x27;s 1905 gubernatorial elections. Díaz considered jailing Madero, but Bernardo Reyes suggested that Francisco&#x27;s father be asked to control his increasingly political son.

===Leader of the Anti-Re-election Movement (1908–1909)===
In an interview with journalist James Creelman published on 17 February 1908 issue of &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, President Díaz said that Mexico was ready for a democracy and that the 1910 presidential election would be a free election.

Madero spent the bulk of 1908 writing a book, which he believed was at the direction of spirits, now including that of Benito Juárez himself. This book, published in January 1909, was titled &quot;La sucesión presidencial en 1910&quot; (&quot;The Presidential Succession of 1910&quot;). The book quickly became a bestseller in Mexico. The book proclaimed that the concentration of absolute power in the hands of one man – Porfirio Díaz – for so long had made Mexico sick. Madero pointed out the irony that in 1871, Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s political slogan had been &quot;No Re-election&quot;. Madero acknowledged that Porfirio Díaz had brought peace and a measure of economic growth to Mexico. However, Madero argued that this was counterbalanced by the dramatic loss of freedom, including the brutal treatment of the Yaqui people, the repression of workers in Cananea, excessive concessions to the United States, and an unhealthy centralization of politics around the person of the president. Madero called for a return of the Liberal 1857 Constitution. To achieve this, Madero proposed organizing a Democratic Party under the slogan &quot;Sufragio efectivo, no reelección&quot; (&quot;Effective Suffrage. No Re-election&quot;). Porfirio Díaz could either run in a free election or retire.

Madero&#x27;s book was well received, and widely read. Many people began to call Madero &quot;the Apostle of Democracy&quot;. Madero sold off much of his property – often at a considerable loss – to finance anti-re-election activities throughout Mexico. He founded the Anti-Re-election Center in Mexico City in May 1909, and soon thereafter lent his backing to the periodical &quot;El Antirreeleccionista&quot;, which was run by the young lawyer/philosopher José Vasconcelos and another intellectual, Luis Cabrera Lobato. In Puebla, Aquiles Serdán, from a politically engaged family, contacted Madero and as a result, formed an Anti-Re-electionist Club to organize for the 1910 elections, particularly among the working classes. Madero traveled throughout Mexico giving anti-reelectionist speeches, and everywhere he went he was greeted by crowds of thousands. His candidacy cost him financially, since he sold much of his property at a loss to back his campaign.

In spite of the attacks by Madero and his earlier statements to the contrary, Díaz ran for re-election. In a show of U.S. support, Díaz and William Howard Taft planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, for 16 October 1909, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also the first time a U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico. At the meeting, Diaz told John Hays Hammond, &quot;Since I am responsible for bringing several billion dollars in foreign investments into my country, I think I should continue in my position until a competent successor is found.&quot; 
The summit was a great success for Díaz, but it could have been a major tragedy. On the day of the summit, Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol along the procession route and they disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Díaz and Taft.

The Porfirian regime reacted to Madero by placing pressure on the Madero family&#x27;s banking interests, and at one point even issued a warrant for Madero&#x27;s arrest on the grounds of &quot;unlawful transaction in rubber&quot;. Madero was not arrested, though, apparently due in part to the intervention of Díaz&#x27;s finance minister, José Yves Limantour, a friend of the Madero family. In April 1910, the Anti-Re-electionist Party met and selected Madero as their nominee for President of Mexico.

During the convention, the governor of Veracruz arranged a meeting between Madero and Díaz, Teodoro Dehesa, and took place in Díaz&#x27;s residence on 16 April 1910. Only the candidate and the president were present for the meeting, so the only account of it is Madero&#x27;s correspondence. A political solution and compromise might have been possible, with Madero withdrawing his candidacy. It became clear to Madero that Díaz was a decrepit old man, out of touch politically, and unaware of the extent of formal political opposition. The meeting was important for strengthening Madero&#x27;s resolve that political compromise was not possible and he is quoted as saying &quot;Porfirio is not an imposing chief. Nevertheless, it will be necessary to start a revolution to overthrow him. But who will crush it afterwards?&quot; Madero was worried that Porfirio Díaz would not willingly relinquish office, warned his supporters of the possibility of electoral fraud and proclaimed that &quot;Force shall be met by force!&quot;

===Campaign, arrest, escape 1910===

Madero campaigned across the country on a message of reform and met with numerous supporters. Resentful of the &quot;peaceful invasion&quot; from the United States &quot;which came to control 90 percent of Mexico&#x27;s mineral resources, its national railroad, its oil industry and, increasingly, its land,&quot; Mexico&#x27;s poor and middle-class overwhelmingly showed their support for Madero. Fearful of a dramatic change in direction, on 6 June 1910, the Porfirian regime arrested Madero in Monterrey and sent him to a prison in San Luis Potosí. Approximately 5,000 other members of the Anti-Re-electionist movement were also jailed. Francisco Vázquez Gómez took over the nomination, but during Madero&#x27;s time in jail, a fraudulent election was held on 21 June 1910 that gave Díaz an unbelievably large margin of victory.

Madero&#x27;s father used his influence with the state governor and posted bond to give Madero the right to move about the city on horseback during the day. On 4 October 1910, Madero galloped away from his guards and took refuge with sympathizers in a nearby village. Three days later he was smuggled across the U.S. border, hidden in a baggage car by sympathetic railway workers. He took up residence in San Antonio, Texas, where he plotted his next moves. He wrote the Plan of San Luis Potosí in San Antonio, but back dated and situated in to last place he had been in Mexico.

===Plan of San Luis Potosí and rebellion===
Madero set up shop in San Antonio, Texas, and quickly issued his Plan of San Luis Potosí, which had been written during his time in prison, partly with the help of Ramón López Velarde. The plan proclaimed the elections of 1910 null and void, and called for an armed revolution to begin at 6 pm on 20 November 1910, against the &quot;illegitimate presidency/dictatorship of Díaz&quot;. At that point, Madero declared himself provisional President of Mexico, and called for a general refusal to acknowledge the central government, restitution of land to villages and Indian communities, and freedom for political prisoners. Madero&#x27;s policies painted him as a leader of each of the different sectors of Mexican society at the time. He was a member of the upper class; the middle class saw that he sought to gain entry into political processes; the lower class saw that he promised fairer politics and a much more substantial, equitable economic system.

The family drew on its financial resources to make regime change possible, with Madero&#x27;s brother Gustavo A. Madero hiring the law firm of Washington lawyer Sherburne Hopkins, the &quot;world&#x27;s best rigger of Latin American revolutions&quot; to foment support in the U.S. A strategy to discredit Díaz with U.S. business and the U.S. government did meet some success, with Standard Oil engaging in talks with Gustavo Madero, but more importantly, the U.S. government &quot;bent neutrality laws for the revolutionaries.&quot; The U.S. Senate held hearings in 1913 as to whether the U.S. had any role in fomenting revolution in Mexico, Hopkins gave testimony that &quot;he did not believe that it cost the Maderos themselves more than $400,000 gold&quot;, with the aggregate cost being $1,500,000US.

Madero supposedly initiated the Mexican Revolution with guidance from spirits (Madero identified as a medium who communicated with ghosts, including historical figures like Benito Juarez and even his deceased younger brother.) 

El Paso, Texas, became a major staging point for Madero&#x27;s insurrection against Díaz. It is directly across the Rio Grande from Ciudad Juárez, where two railway Mexican lines, the Mexican National Railroad and the Mexican Northwest Railroad, are connected with the U.S. Southern Pacific Railroad. El Paso was the site of a historic meeting between Mexican President Porfirio Díaz and U.S. President William Howard Taft in 1909. The population of the twin border cities increased dramatically in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with legal commerce and considerable smuggling, &quot;a time-honored occupation along the border.&quot; As the political tensions in Mexico increased, the smuggling of guns and ammunition to insurrectionists was big business. Madero remained in San Antonio, Texas, but his main man in Chihuahua, Abraham González had recruited gifted, natural military leaders, Pancho Villa and Pascual Orozco, to Madero&#x27;s cause. Chihuahua became the hub of insurrectionist activity. Villa and Orozco had increasing success against the Federal Army, which drew more recruits to Madero&#x27;s cause since it seemed to have a real chance at success. , a follower of Ricardo Flores Magón, who forbade members of the Magonista movement to have anything to do with the Madero movement, but the pragmatist Villareal joined Madero.

On 20 November 1910, Madero arrived at the border and planned to meet up with 400 men raised by his uncle Catarino Benavides Hernández to launch an attack on Ciudad Porfirio Díaz (modern-day Piedras Negras, Coahuila). However, his uncle arrived late and brought only ten men. Madero decided to postpone the revolution. Instead, he and his brother Raúl (who had been given the same name as his late brother) traveled incognito to New Orleans, Louisiana.

On 14 February 1911, Madero crossed the border into Chihuahua state from Texas, and on 6 March 1911 led 130 men in an attack on Casas Grandes, Chihuahua. Although holding democratic ideals that attracted many to his movement, Madero learned he was not a military leader. &quot;Madero didn&#x27;t know the first thing about warfare,&quot; initially capturing the town from the Federal Army, but he did not realize he needed to scout whether Federal reinforcements were on the way. There were heavy casualties among the insurrectionists, a number of whom were foreigners, including many from the U.S. and some from Germany. Two survivors of the Casas Grandes debacle were Giuseppe Garibaldi II, grandson of the famous Italian revolutionary, and General Benjamin Johannes Viljoen, an Afrikaner veteran of the Boer War. Madero was slightly wounded in his right arm in the fighting, shown bandaged in a photograph. Madero was saved by his personal bodyguard and Revolutionary general Máximo Castillo. He remained head of the movement in the north to oust Díaz. Madero movement successfully imported arms from the United States, procured by agents in the United States. Some were shipped directly from New York, disguised so that they would not be intercepted by the U.S. government. There were two businesses in El Paso that sold arms and ammunition to the rebels. The U.S. government of President William Howard Taft hired agents to surveil insurrectionists, fairly openly operated in El Paso. But the U.S. government efforts to halt the flow of arms to the Mexican revolutionaries failed.

By April the Revolution had spread to eighteen states, including Morelos where the leader was Emiliano Zapata. On 1 April 1911, Porfirio Díaz claimed that he had heard the voice of the people of Mexico, replaced his cabinet, and agreed to restitution of the lands of the dispossessed. Madero did not believe this statement and instead demanded the resignation of President Díaz and Vice-president Ramón Corral. Madero then attended a meeting with the other revolutionary leaders – they agreed to a fourteen-point plan which called for pay for revolutionary soldiers; the release of political prisoners; and the right of the revolutionaries to name several members of cabinet. Madero was moderate, however. He believed that the revolutionaries should proceed cautiously so as to minimize bloodshed and should strike a deal with Díaz if possible.

In early May, Madero wanted to extend a ceasefire, but his fellow revolutionaries Pascual Orozco and Pancho Villa disagreed and went ahead without orders on 8 May to attack Ciudad Juárez. It surrendered after two days of bloody fighting. The revolutionaries won this battle decisively, making it clear that Díaz could no longer retain power.

On 21 May 1911, the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez was signed. Under the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez, Díaz and Corral agreed to resign by the end of May 1911, with Díaz&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Francisco León de la Barra, becoming interim president solely for the purpose of calling general elections. Madero did not want to come to power by force of arms, but by a democratic election.

This first phase of the Mexican Revolution thus ended with Díaz leaving for exile in Europe at the end of May 1911. He was escorted to the port of Veracruz by General Victoriano Huerta. On 7 June 1911, Madero entered Mexico City in triumph where he was greeted with huge crowds shouting &quot;¡Viva Madero!&quot;

Madero was arriving not as the conquering hero, but as a presidential candidate who now embarked on campaigning for the fall presidential election. He left in place all but the top political figures of the Díaz regime as well as the Federal Army, which had just been defeated by revolutionary forces. The Governor of Coahuila, Venustiano Carranza, and Luis Cabrera had strongly advised Madero not to sign the treaty, since it gave away the power the revolutionary forces had won. For Madero, that was not the only consideration. Madero saw that revolutionaries like Orozco were not going to docilely obey his orders not to attack and the situation could get even more out of hand when Díaz resigned. Madero recognized the legitimacy of the Federal Army and called on revolutionary forces to disband. &quot;Having removed Díaz, it appeared that Madero was trying to contain the Revolutionary tiger before it had time to enjoy its liberty.&quot;

===Interim presidency of De la Barra (May–November 1911)===
Although Madero and his supporters had forced Porfirio Díaz from power, he did not assume the presidency in June 1911. Instead, following the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez, he was a candidate for president and had no formal role in the interim presidency of Francisco León de la Barra, a diplomat and lawyer. Left in place was the Congress of Mexico, which was full of candidates whom Díaz had handpicked for the 1910 election. By doing this, Madero was true to his ideological commitment to constitutional democracy, but with members of the Díaz regime still in power, he was caused difficulties in the short and long term. The German ambassador to Mexico, Paul von Hintze, who associated with the Interim President, said of him that &quot;De la Barra wants to accommodate himself with dignity to the inevitable advance of the ex-revolutionary influence, while accelerating the widespread collapse of the Madero party...&quot; Madero sought to be a moderate democrat and follow the course outlined in treaty bringing about exile of Díaz, but by calling for the disarming and demobilization of his revolutionary base, he undermined his support. The Mexican Federal Army, just defeated by the revolutionaries, was to continue as the armed force of the Mexican state. Madero argued that the revolutionaries should henceforth proceed solely by peaceful means. In the south, revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata was skeptical about disbanding his troops, especially since the Federal Army from the Díaz era remained essentially intact. However, Madero traveled south to meet with Zapata at Cuernavaca and Cuautla, Morelos. Madero assured Zapata that the land redistribution promised in the Plan of San Luis Potosí would be carried out when Madero became president.

With Madero now campaigning for the presidency, which he was expected to win, several landowners from Zapata&#x27;s state of Morelos took advantage of his not being head of state and appealed to President De la Barra and the Congress to restore their lands which had been seized by Zapatista revolutionaries. They spread exaggerated stories of atrocities committed by Zapata&#x27;s irregulars, calling Zapata the &quot;Attila of the South&quot;. De la Barra and the Congress, therefore, decided to send regular troops under Victoriano Huerta to suppress Zapata&#x27;s revolutionaries. Madero once again traveled south to urge Zapata to disband his supporters peacefully, but Zapata refused on the grounds that Huerta&#x27;s troops were advancing on Yautepec. Zapata&#x27;s suspicions proved accurate as Huerta&#x27;s Federal soldiers moved violently into Yautepec. Madero wrote to De la Barra, saying that Huerta&#x27;s actions were unjustified and recommending that Zapata&#x27;s demands be met. However, when he left the south, he had achieved nothing. Nevertheless, he promised the Zapatistas that once he became president, things would change. Most Zapatistas had grown suspicious of Madero, however.

==Presidency and assassination (November 1911 – February 1913)==

Madero became president in November 1911, and, intending to reconcile the nation, appointed a cabinet that included many of Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s supporters, as well as Madero&#x27;s uncle Ernesto Madero, as Minister of Finance. A curious fact is that almost immediately after taking office in November, Madero became the first head of state in the world to fly in an airplane, which the Mexican press was later to mock. Madero was unable to achieve the reconciliation he desired since conservative Porfirians had organized themselves during the interim presidency and now mounted a sustained and effective opposition to Madero&#x27;s reform program. Conservatives in the Senate refused to pass the reforms he advocated. At the same time, several of Madero&#x27;s allies denounced him for being overly conciliatory with the Porfirians and with not moving aggressively forward with reforms.

After years of censorship, Mexican newspapers took advantage of their newly found freedom of the press to harshly criticize Madero&#x27;s performance as president. Gustavo A. Madero, the president&#x27;s brother, remarked that &quot;the newspapers bite the hand that took off their muzzle.&quot; President Madero refused the recommendation of some of his advisors that he bring back censorship. The press was particularly critical of Madero&#x27;s handling of rebellions that broke out against his rule shortly after he became president.

Despite internal and external opposition, the Madero administration had a number of important accomplishments, including freedom of the press. He freed political prisoners and abolished the death penalty. He did away with the practice of the Díaz government, which appointed local political bosses (&quot;jefes políticos&quot;), and instead set up a system of independent municipal authorities. State elections were free and fair. He was concerned about the improvement of education, establishing new schools and workshops. An important step was the creation of a federal department of labor, limited the workday to 10 hours, and set in place regulations on women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s labor. Unions were granted the right to freely organize. The &quot;Casa del Obrero Mundial&quot; (&quot;House of the World Worker&quot;), an organization with anarcho-syndicalist was founded during his presidency.

Madero alienated a number of his political supporters when he created a new political party, the Constitutionalist Progressive party, which replaced the Anti-Reelectionist Party. He ousted leftist Emilio Vázquez Gómez from his cabinet, brother of Francisco Vázquez Gómez, whom Madero had replaced as his vice presidential candidate with Pino Suárez.

Madero made gestures of reform to those who had helped bring him to power, but his aim was a democratic transition to power, fulfilled by his election. His supporters were offered mild gestures of reform, creating a Department of Labor and a National Agrarian Commission, but organized labor and peasants seeking land did not have their fundamental situations changed.

===Rebellions===

Madero retained the Mexican Federal Army and ordered the demobilization of revolutionary forces. For revolutionaries who considered themselves the reason that Díaz resigned, this was a hard course to follow. Since Madero did not implement immediate, radical reforms that many of those had supported him had expected, he lost control of those areas in Morelos and Chihuahua. A series of internal rebellions challenged Madero&#x27;s presidency before the February 1913 coup that deposed him.

====Zapatista rebellion====
In Morelos, Emiliano Zapata proclaimed the Plan of Ayala on 25 November 1911, which excoriated Madero&#x27;s slowness on land reform and declared the signatories in rebellion. Zapata&#x27;s plan recognized Pascual Orozco as fellow revolutionary, although Orozco was for the moment loyal to Madero, until 1912. Madero sent the Federal Army to suppress the rebellion, but failed to do so. For Madero&#x27;s opponents this was evidence of his ineffectiveness as a leader.

====Reyes rebellion====
In December 1911, General Bernardo Reyes, whom Porfirio Díaz had sent to Europe on a diplomatic mission because Díaz worried that Reyes was going to challenge him for the presidency, launched a rebellion in Nuevo León, where he had previously served as governor. He called for &quot;the people&quot; to rise against Madero. &quot;His rebellion was a total failure&quot;, lasting only eleven days before Reyes surrendered to the Federal Army at Linares, Nuevo León. When the rebellion broke out, Madero made a calculated decision to entrust Pascual Orozco to put it down. In the fight against Dįaz, Orozco had led revolutionary forces in the north capturing Ciudad Juárez, against Madero&#x27;s orders. Madero had not treated him well after he was elected, but entrusted him over General Victoriano Huerta. Huerta had previously been a supporter of Reyes, and Madero was concerned that Huerta would join with Reyes rather than suppress the rebellion. In one historian&#x27;s assessment, &quot;President Madero played his political cards perfectly this occasion. Had he dispatched a large force to the north under the command of either Huerta of [General] Blanquet, it is quite possible that a major military defection, seriously threatening the government.&quot; Reyes was sent to the Santiago Tlatelolco military prison in Mexico City. Madero allowed Reyes privileges while in prison, which allowed him to organize subsequent conspiracies from jail.

====Vázquez Gómez rebellion====
Nearly simultaneous with Reyes&#x27;s rebellion, Emilio Vázquez Gómez, rose in rebellion. Emilio was the brother of Francisco Vázquez Gómez whom Madero replaced as the vice presidential candidate Pino Suárez when he successfully ran for president. Emilio gathered supporters in Chihuahua, with a number of small rebellions against the Madero&#x27;s regime breaking out in December 1911. Although Madero sent the Federal Army, he then sent Orozco to put down the rebellion. Rebels had captured and looted Ciudad Juáréz. Orozco arrived with a contingent of troops. Still popular in Chihuahua, Orozco persuaded rebels to lay down their arms against Madero. Madero was delighted that Orozco had been so successful in dealing with two rebellions.

====Orozco rebellion====
The two small, northern rebellions that Orozco suppressed showed his again his military skills, but with the Vázquez Gómez rebellion, he realized his continued popularity. In his recent dealings with Madero, the president had shown him respect, which was much lacking after Orozco disobeyed Madero&#x27;s orders not to take Ciudad Juárez in May 1911 when Madero was attempting non-military means to persuade Dįaz to resign. Orozco was personally resentful of how President Madero had treated him once he was in office. He launched a rebellion in Chihuahua in March 1912 with the financial backing of Luis Terrazas, a former Governor of Chihuahua who was the largest landowner in Mexico. Northern oligarchs had opposed ousting of Díaz and Madero&#x27;s presidency and saw in Orozco a potential ally, a rival to oust Madero. They began flattering him that he was the man to bring order to Mexico. Madero&#x27;s advisors had repeatedly warned Madero that Orozco was untrustworthy, but Madero had just seen the demonstration of Orozco&#x27;s loyalty in preserving his presidency. Orozco&#x27;s &quot;revolution came as a complete shock to Madero.&quot;

At his request, Madero dispatched troops under General José González Salas, the Secretary of War, to put down the rebellion. González Salas was not a seasoned campaign general, but he did not want Huerta to be dispatched. Unlike the two small, unsuccessful rebellions that attracted few followers, Orozco not only had an army to 8,000 men, he had backing from landowning interests, and a detailed battle plan to sweep through Chihuahua and capture Mexico City. Although González Salas commanded forces of 2,000 troops, he was an ineffective leader. In the first major encounter, Orozco triumphed, crushing the Federal Army. González Salas committed suicide after the military humiliation.General Victoriano Huerta assumed control of the federalist forces. Huerta was more successful, defeating Orozco&#x27;s troops in three major battles and forcing Orozco to flee to the United States in September 1912.

Relations between Huerta and Madero grew strained during the course of this campaign when Pancho Villa, the commander of the &quot;División del Norte&quot;, refused orders from General Huerta. Huerta ordered Villa&#x27;s execution, but Madero commuted the sentence and Villa was sent to the same Santiago Tlatelolco prison as Reyes from which he escaped on Christmas Day 1912. Angry at Madero&#x27;s commutation of Villa&#x27;s sentence, Huerta, after a long night of drinking, mused about reaching an agreement with Orozco and together deposing Madero as president. When Mexico&#x27;s Minister of War learned of General Huerta&#x27;s comments, he stripped Huerta of his command, but Madero intervened and restored Huerta to command.

====Félix Díaz rebellion====
October 1912, Félix Díaz (nephew of Porfirio Díaz) launched a rebellion in Veracruz, hoping to capitalize on his famous name and with support from the U.S. But even with U.S. support, Díaz&#x27;s rebellion collapsed after no Mexican generals or the general populace supported it. Díaz was arrested and imprisoned. Although Díaz was sentenced to death for his rebellion, the Supreme Court of Mexico, whose judges were appointed by former President Díaz, declared that Félix Díaz would be imprisoned, but not executed. Madero did not interfere with the decision; Díaz was transferred to the same prison where Reyes was incarcerated, where the two plotted further conspiracies. &quot;Madero displayed a fatal softness toward the leaders of these coup attempts.

===U.S. and the Madero government===

Initially, the U.S. was cautiously optimistic about Madero leading the new government. He had kept the Federal Army and the federal bureaucracy, and dismissed the revolutionary forces that brought him to power. Although his Plan of San Luis Potosí signaled his openness to land reform, he failed to move on it, which did not have an impact on the U.S. or its business interests. Madero displayed no overt anti-Americanism, but his resistance to U.S. pressure on a variety of issues were taken as that by the U.S. government and business interests. He did not follow through on promises made in his name, perhaps by his brother Gustavo A. Madero, to turn Mexico&#x27;s oil industry over to the Standard Oil Company. He refused to satisfy U.S. demands for compensation for life and property outside of a bilateral commission. He planned to institute universal male military service, which would have strengthened Mexico&#x27;s position against foreign powers. Furthermore, Madero&#x27;s lifting of restrictions on labor organizing had resulted in strikes, which had an impact on U.S. companies in Mexico. Likewise, Madero was not deviating from President Díaz&#x27;s firmness against demands that infringed on Mexican sovereignty and domestic policy, but the U.S. pressed the issues. 

The United States&#x27; position towards the Madero regime grew increasingly hostile. The U.S. Ambassador, Henry Lane Wilson conducted a campaign of anti-Madero propaganda and disinformation, aimed at alarming the American residents, a campaign against Madero in U.S. newspapers. The U.S. government and business interests, too, increasingly backed rebellions against Madero.

===Germany and the Madero government===
Germany had business interests in Mexico, in banking and in exports from Germany, but it was reluctant to challenge the U.S. as the premier foreign arbiter in Mexico. In the period before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, it followed the lead of the U.S. of initially being optimistic about Madero&#x27;s moderation against revolutionary tendencies. But when U.S. turned against Madero, the U.S. ambassador and the German ambassador Paul von Hintze were in close contact. Hintze&#x27;s reports on the situation in Mexico during the Madero presidency were a rich source of information about the regime. Although the U.S. attempted to draw Germany as well as Great Britain into intervention in Mexico, both held back. They also sought to prevent the U.S. from intervening itself. Hintze had a low opinion of Félix Díaz, and saw the head of the Mexican Federal Army, Victoriano Huerta, as an appropriate candidate as a military dictator. That view dictated his actions as a plan for a coup was hatched in early 1913.

==Successful coup against Madero ==

In early 1913, General Félix Díaz (Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s nephew) and General Bernardo Reyes plotted the overthrow of Madero. Now known in Mexican history as the Ten Tragic Days, from 9 to 19 February events in the capital led to the overthrow and murder of Madero and his vice president. Rebel forces bombarded the National Palace and downtown Mexico City from the military arsenal (&quot;ciudadela&quot;). Madero&#x27;s loyalists initially held their ground, but Madero&#x27;s commander, General Victoriano Huerta secretly switched sides to support the rebels. Madero&#x27;s decision to appoint Huerta as commander of forces in Mexico City was one &quot;for which he would pay for with his life.&quot; Madero and his vice president were arrested. Under pressure Madero resigned the presidency, with the expectation that he would go into exile, as had President Díaz in May 1911. Madero&#x27;s brother and advisor Gustavo A. Madero was kidnapped off the street, tortured, and killed. Following Huerta&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état on 18 February 1913, Madero was forced to resign. After a 45-minute term of office, Pedro Lascuráin was replaced by Huerta, who took over the presidency later that day.Following his forced resignation, Madero and his Vice-president José María Pino Suárez were kept under guard in the National Palace. On the evening of 22 February, they were told that they were to be transferred to the main city penitentiary, where they would be safer. At 11:15 pm, reporters waiting outside the National Palace saw two cars containing Madero and Suárez emerge from the main gate under a heavy escort commanded by Major Francisco Cárdenas, an officer of the rurales. The journalists on foot were outdistanced by the motor vehicles, which were driven towards the penitentiary. The correspondent for the &quot;New York World&quot; was approaching the prison when he heard a volley of shots. Behind the building, he found the two cars with the bodies of Madero and Suárez nearby, surrounded by soldiers and gendarmes. Major Cárdenas subsequently told reporters that the cars and their escort had been fired on by a group, as they neared the penitentiary. The two prisoners had leapt from the vehicles and ran towards their presumed rescuers. They had however been killed in the cross-fire the night of 22 February. This account was treated with general disbelief, although the American ambassador Henry Lane Wilson, a strong supporter of Huerta, reported to Washington that, &quot;I am disposed to accept the (Huerta) government&#x27;s version of the affair and consider it a closed incident&quot;.
President Madero, dead at 39, was buried quietly in the French cemetery of Mexico City. A series of contemporary photographs taken by Manuel Ramos show Maderos&#x27;s coffin being carried from the penitentiary and placed on a special funeral tram car for transportation to the cemetery. Only his close family were permitted to attend, leaving for Cuba immediately after. Following Huerta&#x27;s overthrow, Francisco Cárdenas fled to Guatemala where he committed suicide in 1920 after the new Mexican government had requested his extradition to stand trial for the murder of Madero.

==Aftermath of coup==

There was shock at Madero&#x27;s murder, but there were many, including Mexican elites and foreign entrepreneurs and governments, who saw the coup and the emergence of General Huerta as the desired strongman to return order to Mexico. Among elites in Mexico, Madero&#x27;s death was a cause of rejoicing, seeing the time since Díaz&#x27;s resignation as one of political instability and economic uncertainty. Ordinary Mexicans in the capital, however, were dismayed by the coup, since many considered Madero a friend, but their feelings did not translate into concrete action against the Huerta regime. In northern Mexico, Madero&#x27;s overthrow and martyrdom united forces against Huerta&#x27;s usurpation of power. Governor of Coahuila, Venustiano Carranza refused to support the new regime although most state governors had. He brought together a coalition of revolutionaries under the banner of the Mexican Constitution, so that the Constitutionalist Army fought for the principles of constitutional democracy that Madero embraced. In southern Mexico, Zapata had been in rebellion against the Madero government for its slow action on land reform and continued in rebellion against the Huerta regime. However, Zapata repudiated his former high opinion of fellow revolutionary Pascual Orozco, who had also rebelled against Madero, when Orozco allied with Huerta. Madero&#x27;s anti-reelectionist movement had mobilized revolutionary action that led to the resignation of Díaz. Madero&#x27;s overthrow and murder during the Ten Tragic Days was a prelude to further years of civil war.
For Mexicans hopeful of positive change with the Madero presidency, his performance in office was not inspiring, but as a martyr to the revolution ousted and murdered by reactionary forces with the aid of the United States ambassador, he became a powerful unifying force. The Governor of Coahuila, Madero&#x27;s home state, became the leader of the northern revolutionaries opposing the Huerta. Venustiano Carranza had been put in office by Madero. Carranza named the broad-based, anti-Huerta northern coalition the Constitutionalist Army, invoking the Mexican Constitution of 1857 and rule of law that they hoped to restore. In 1915, a Constitutionalist supporter created a chart outlining the political leaders of the time, calling Madero &quot;The Great Democrat, elected president by the unanimous will of the people.&quot; But by 1917, when the Constitutionalists had emerged as the winning faction of the revolution, Carranza began reshaping the historical narrative of the revolution that excluded Madero entirely. For Carranza, the revolution had three periods, with the start date being the armed struggle against Huerta, led by himself. After three years as constitutional president, Carranza himself was ousted and killed in a 1920 coup by Sonoran revolutionary generals, Álvaro Obregón, Plutarco Elías Calles, and Adolfo de la Huerta. Madero&#x27;s status as a hero of the revolution was restored by the Sonoran dynasty, which deliberately constructed a narrative of historical memory that endures. 20 November, the day that Madero set in the Plan of San Luis Potosí for the rebellion against Porfirio Díaz, became a national day of celebration.

==Historical memory and popular culture==

Madero was known as &quot;The Apostle of Democracy,&quot; but &quot;Madero the martyr meant more to the soul of Mexico.&quot;

Despite Madero&#x27;s importance as a historical figure, there are relatively few memorials or monuments to him. It was not until the Monument to the Revolution was completed in 1938 that Madero had a public resting place. He had been interred in the French cemetery in Mexico City after his death. His tomb had been an informal pilgrimage site on the anniversary of his murder (22 February) and the proclamation of his Plan of San Luis Potosí (20 November), which launched the Mexican Revolution. Initially, the monument to the Revolution held the remains of Madero, Carranza, and Villa and was planned as a collective commemoration of the Revolution, not individual revolutionaries. Although it was completed on 20 November 1938, there was no inaugural ceremony.

The date of Madero&#x27;s Plan of San Luis Potosí, 20 November, was a fixed official holiday in Mexico, Revolution Day, but a 2005 change in the law makes the third Monday in November the day of commemoration. During the presidency of Venustiano Carranza, he ignored 20 November and commemorated 26 March, the anniversary of his Plan de Guadalupe.
The Mexico City Metro has a stop named for Madero&#x27;s vice president, Metro Pino Suárez, but not one to Madero. General Alvaro Obregón laid a foundation stone on the 10th anniversary of Madero&#x27;s death of a planned Madero statue in the zócalo, but the statue was never built. A statue was erected in 1956 at a downtown intersection in Mexico City and has been moved to the presidential residence, Los Pinos, not easily viewable by the public. An exception is Avenida Madero in Mexico City. One contemporaneous honor by General Pancho Villa remains in Mexico City. On the morning of 8 December 1914, he declared that the street leading from the Zócalo in Mexico City towards the Paseo de la Reforma would be named for Madero. Still officially called Francisco I. Madero Avenue, but commonly known simply as Madero street, it is one of the most popular and historically significant streets in the city. It was pedestrianised in 2009.

Mexican artist José Guadalupe Posada created an etching for a broadside, produced on the occasion of Madero&#x27;s election in 1910, titled &quot;Calavera de Madero&quot; portraying Madero as a calavera.

Madero appears in the films &quot;Viva Villa!&quot; (1934), &quot;Villa Rides&quot; (1968) and &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; (1952).

In the novel &quot;The Friends of Pancho Villa&quot; (1996) by James Carlos Blake, Madero is a major character.

Along with Hermila Galindo and Carmen Serdán, Madero appears on the obverse of the 1000 Mexican peso banknote issued from 2020.

Madero and his family described in a very positive light in &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; in a prize winning novel by Cormac McCarthy.

<text>Fruitarianism () is a diet that consists primarily of consuming fruits and possibly nuts and seeds, but without any animal products. Fruitarian diets are subject to criticism and health concerns.

Fruitarianism may be adopted for different reasons, including ethical, religious, environmental, cultural, economic, and presumed health benefits. A fruitarian diet may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as reduced intake of vitamin B12, calcium, iron, zinc, omega-3 or protein.

==Varieties==

Some fruitarians will eat only what falls (or would fall) naturally from a plant; that is, plant foods that can be harvested without killing or harming the plant. These foods consist primarily of culinary fruits, nuts, and seeds. Some do not eat grains, believing it is unnatural to do so, and some fruitarians feel that it is improper for humans to eat seeds as they contain future plants, or nuts and seeds, or any food besides juicy fruit. Others believe they should eat only plants that spread seeds when the plant is eaten. Others eat seeds and some cooked foods. Some fruitarians use the botanical definitions of fruits and consume pulses, such as beans, peas, or other legumes. Other fruitarians&#x27; diets include raw fruits, dried fruits, nuts, honey and olive oil, nuts, beans or chocolate.

A related diet is nutarianism, for individuals who only eat nuts.

==Ideology and diet==
Some fruitarians, like Jains, wish to avoid killing anything, including plants, and refer to ahimsa fruitarianism. For some fruitarians, the motivation comes from a fixation on a utopian past, their hope being to return to a past that pre-dates an agrarian society to when humans were simply gatherers. Another common motivation is the desire to eliminate perceived toxicity from within the body. For others, the appeal of a fruitarian diet comes from the challenge that the restrictive nature of this diet provides.

==Nutrition==
According to nutritionists, adults must be careful not to follow a fruit-only diet for too long. A fruitarian diet is wholly unsuitable for children (including teens), nursing mothers and their babies. Death can result from malnutrition.

===Nutritional effects===
Fruitarianism is more restrictive than veganism or raw veganism, as a subset of both. Maintaining this diet over a long period can result in dangerous deficiencies, a risk that many fruitarians try to ward off through nutritional testing and vitamin injections. The Health Promotion Program at Columbia University reports that a fruitarian diet can cause deficiencies in calcium, protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D, most B vitamins (especially B12), and essential fatty acids.

Although fruit provides a source of carbohydrates, they have very little protein, and because protein cannot be stored in the body as fat and carbohydrates can, fruitarians need to be careful that they consume enough protein each day. When the body does not absorb enough protein, it leads to a deficiency of amino acids, which are essential to creating body proteins which support the growth and maintenance of body tissues. Consuming high amounts of fruit also poses a risk to those who are diabetic or pre-diabetic, due to the negative effect that the large amounts of sugar in fruits has on blood sugar levels. These high levels of sugar mean that fruitarians are at a higher risk for tooth decay. Another concern that fruitarianism presents is that because fruit is easily digested, the body burns through meals quickly, and is hungry again soon after eating. A side effect of the digestibility is that the body will defecate more frequently.
Additionally, the Health Promotion Program at Columbia reports that food restrictions in general may lead to hunger, cravings, food obsessions, social disruptions, and social isolation. The severe dietary restrictions inherent in a fruitarian regime also carries the serious risk of triggering orthorexia nervosa.

Harriet Hall has written that a fruitarian diet &quot;leads to nutritional deficiencies, especially in children. Fruitarians can develop protein energy malnutrition, anemia, and low levels of iron, calcium, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.&quot;

====Vitamin B12====
Vitamin B12, a bacterial product, cannot be obtained from fruits. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, &quot;natural food sources of vitamin B12 are limited to foods that come from animals.&quot; Like raw vegans who do not consume B12-fortified foods (for example, certain plant milks and some breakfast cereals), fruitarians may need to include a B12 supplement in their diet or risk vitamin B12 deficiency.

===Growth and development concerns===
In children, growth and development may be at risk. Some nutritionists state that children should not follow a fruitarian diet. Nutritional problems include severe protein–energy malnutrition, anemia and deficiencies including protein, iron, calcium, essential fatty acids, raw fibre and a wide range of vitamins and minerals.

==Notable adherents==
Some notable advocates of fruitarianism, or of diets which may be considered fruitarian, or of lifestyles including such a diet, are:

*Otto Abramowski, Australian naturopath who lectured on the fruitarian diet.
* Idi Amin, the Ugandan military dictator who became a fruitarian while exiled in Saudi Arabia.
* Sidney H. Beard
*Arnold Ehret
*August Engelhardt
*Raymond W. Bernard
*Hereward Carrington
* Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, better known as Indian political and spiritual leader Mahatma Gandhi, sustained a fruitarian diet for five years. He apparently discontinued the diet and went back to vegetarianism due to pleurisy, a pre-existing condition, after pressure from Dr. Jivraj Mehta.
* Ben Klassen
*Author Morris Krok, who earlier in his life lived &quot;only on fruits&quot;, allegedly advised against a diet of &quot;only fruit&quot;, although it was subsequently reported that Krok&#x27;s diet consisted of &quot;just fruit&quot;, with dietary practices of fruitarians as varied as definitions of the term &quot;fruitarianism&quot;. 
*Actor Ashton Kutcher was hospitalized and said that his &quot;pancreas levels were completely out of whack&quot; after following a fruitarian diet in preparation for his role playing Apple Inc. CEO and onetime fruitarian Steve Jobs, in the film &quot;Jobs.&quot;
*Apple cofounder Steve Jobs began fruitarianism as a college freshman, and practiced it later in life.
*The Order of the Golden Age published the journal &quot;Herald of the Golden Age&quot; (1896–1918), which promoted a &quot;fruitarian system of living&quot;. 
*Timothy Redmond, drummer of the band Snapcase.
*Gustav Schlickeysen
*W. B. Shearn, florist who managed the first fruitarian restaurant in London.
==In popular culture==
The minor character Keziah in the 1999 film &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (played by Emma Bernard) tells William &quot;Will&quot; Thacker (Hugh Grant) that she is a fruitarian. She says she believes that &quot;fruits and vegetables have feeling,&quot; meaning she opposes cooking them, only eating things that have &quot;actually fallen off a tree or bush&quot; and that are dead already, leading to what some describe as a negative depiction.

Both fruitarians and nutarians are mentioned in &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce. Dick Gregory also promoted the former in his book, &quot;Cooking with Mother Nature&quot;.

<text>The foreign relations of Afghanistan are in a transitional phase since the 2021 fall of Kabul to the Taliban and the collapse of the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. No country has recognised the new Taliban-run government, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Although some countries have engaged in informal diplomatic contact with the Islamic Emirate, formal relations remain limited to representatives of the Islamic Republic.

== History ==
In the 19th century, Afghanistan had to contend with aggression on multiple sides, as it became part of the Great Game confrontation between Britain and Russia.

=== Contemporary era ===
Before the Soviet invasion, Afghanistan pursued a policy of neutrality and non-alignment in its foreign relations, being one of the few independent nations to stay neutral in both World War I and World War II. In international forums, Afghanistan generally followed the voting patterns of Asian and African non-aligned countries. During the 1950s and 1960s, Afghanistan was able to use the Soviet and American need for allies during the Cold War as a way to receive economic assistance from both countries. However, given that unlike the Soviet Union, the United States refused to give extensive military aid to the country, the government of Daoud Khan developed warmer ties with the USSR while officially remaining non-aligned. Following the coup of April 1978, the government under Nur Muhammad Taraki developed significantly closer ties with the Soviet Union and its communist satellites.

After the December 1979 Soviet invasion, Afghanistan&#x27;s foreign policy mirrored that of the Soviet Union. Afghan foreign policymakers attempted, with little success, to increase their regime&#x27;s low standing in the non-communist world. With the signing of the Geneva Accords, President Najibullah unsuccessfully sought to end the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan&#x27;s isolation within the Islamic world and in the Non-Aligned Movement.

Most Western countries, including the United States, maintained small diplomatic missions in the Afghan capital Kabul during the Soviet occupation. Many countries subsequently closed their missions due to instability and heavy fighting in Kabul after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989.

Many countries initially welcomed the introduction of the Taliban regime, who they saw as a stabilising, law-enforcing alternative to the warlords who had ruled the country since the fall of Najibullah&#x27;s government in 1992. The Taliban soon alienated itself as knowledge of the harsh Sharia law being enforced in Taliban-controlled territories spread around the world. The brutality towards women who attempted to work, learn, or leave the house without a male escort caused outside aid to the war-torn country to be limited.

=== Islamic Republic of Afghanistan ===
Following the October 2001 American invasion and the Bonn Agreement the new government under the leadership of Hamid Karzai started to re-establish diplomatic relationships with many countries who had held close diplomatic relations before the communist coup d&#x27;état and the subsequent civil war.

The Afghan government was focused on securing continued assistance for rebuilding the economy, infrastructure, and military of the country. It continued to maintain close ties with North America, the European Union, South Korea, Japan, Australia, India, Pakistan, China, Russia and the Greater Middle East (most specifically Turkey), as well as African nations. It also sought to establish relations with more South American or Latin American nations.

Before the fall of Kabul in 2021, the foreign relations of Afghanistan were handled by the nation&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was headed by Mohammad Hanif Atmar. He answered to, and received guidance from, the President of Afghanistan.

=== Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan ===

The Taliban gradually gained control of the country in the summer of 2021 and proclaimed the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan on August 15, 2021. The takeover culminated with the fall of Kabul. The Taliban has had some limited contact with foreign governments and will need to develop further relations with the international community as its new de facto government goes forward.

On 20 September 2021, the new government designated Mohammad Suhail Shaheen as a replacement for Ghulam M Isaczai, Permanent Representative of Afghanistan to the United Nations who continues to represent the country at the UN. The UNGA&#x27;s nine-member credentials committee will decide on this but no date has been set.

Since the Taliban took over the Afghan government, countries including China, Russia, and the United States have contacted Taliban representatives, but have expressed doubts about its commitment to counterterrorism. Border clashes between the Taliban forces with Pakistan, Iran and Turkmenistan, and border closure and hostilities towards Tajikistan, have also caused friction with Afghanistan&#x27;s neighbours.

In September 2023, China became the first country to formally name a new ambassador to the country since the takeover, even though China still doesn&#x27;t formally recognize the Taliban.

==United Nations==
During the Soviet occupation in the 1980s, the United Nations was highly critical of the Soviet Union&#x27;s interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and was instrumental in obtaining a negotiated Soviet withdrawal under the terms of the Geneva Accords.

In the aftermath of the Accords and subsequent Soviet withdrawal, the United Nations has assisted in the repatriation of refugees and has provided humanitarian aid such as health care, educational programs, and food and has supported mine-clearing operations. The UNDP and associated agencies have undertaken a limited number of development projects. However, the UN reduced its role in Afghanistan in 1992 in the wake of fierce factional strife in and around Kabul. The UN Secretary General has designated a personal representative to head the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA) and the Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), both based in Islamabad, Pakistan. Throughout the late 1990s, 2000, and 2001, the UN unsuccessfully strived to promote a peaceful settlement among the Afghan factions as well as provide humanitarian aid, this despite increasing Taliban restrictions upon UN personnel and agencies.

<text>A felony is traditionally considered a crime of high seriousness, whereas a misdemeanor is regarded as less serious. The term &quot;felony&quot; originated from English common law (from the French medieval word &quot;félonie&quot;) to describe an offense that resulted in the confiscation of a convicted person&#x27;s land and goods, to which additional punishments, including capital punishment, could be added; other crimes were called misdemeanors. Following conviction of a felony in a court of law, a person may be described as a felon or a convicted felon.

In many common law jurisdictions, such as England and Wales, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, crimes are no longer classified as felonies or misdemeanors. Instead, crimes are classified by mode of trial as indictable offences, triable by jury, which are usually more serious, and summary offences, triable by summary procedure without a jury, which are usually less serious.

In some civil law jurisdictions, such as Italy and Spain, the term &quot;delict&quot; is used to describe serious offenses, a category similar to common law felony. In other nations, such as Germany, France, Belgium, and Switzerland, more serious offenses are described as &#x27;crimes&#x27;, while &#x27;misdemeanors&#x27; or &#x27;delicts&#x27; (or &quot;délits&quot;) are less serious. In still others, such as Brazil and Portugal, &#x27;crimes&#x27; and &#x27;delicts&#x27; are synonymous (more serious) and are opposed to contraventions (less serious).

In the United States, where the felony–misdemeanor distinction is still widely applied, the federal government defines a felony as a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. If punishable by exactly one year or less, it is classified as a misdemeanor. The classification is based upon a crime&#x27;s potential sentence, so a crime remains classified as a felony even if a defendant convicted of a felony receives a sentence of one year or less. Some individual states classify crimes by other factors, such as seriousness or context.

== United States ==

In the United States, a felony is a crime that is punishable by death or more than one year in prison. 

===History===
Under common law, felonies were crimes punishable by either death, forfeiture of property, or both. While felony charges remain serious, concerns of proportionality (i.e., that the punishment fits the crime) have since prompted legislatures to require or permit the imposition of less serious punishments, ranging from lesser terms of imprisonment to the substitution of a jail sentence or even the suspension of all incarceration contingent upon a defendant&#x27;s successful completion of probation. Standards for measurement of an offense&#x27;s seriousness include attempts to quantitatively estimate and compare the effects of a crime upon its specific victims or society generally.

The reform of harsh felony laws that had originated in Great Britain was deemed &quot;one of the first fruits of liberty&quot; after the United States became independent.

=== Classification by subject matter ===
Felonies may include but are not limited to the following:
* Aggravated assault or battery
* Animal cruelty
* Arson
* Blackmail
* Burglary
* Child abuse
* Child pornography
* Copyright infringement
* Cybercrime
* Driving under the influence (certain DUI cases involving bodily injury and/or death. In some jurisdictions property damage over a certain amount elevates a DUI charge to a felony as well)
* False Imprisonment
* Forgery
* Fraud
* Grand larceny or grand theft, &quot;i.e.&quot;, larceny or theft above a certain statutorily established value or quantity of goods
* Identity theft
* Illegal drug trade, manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession with intent to distribute] certain types or quantities of illegal drugs. In some jurisdictions, the possession of certain types of illegal drugs for personal use.
* Kidnapping
* Manslaughter (unintentional killing of another)
* Murder
* Obstruction of justice
* Perjury
* Police impersonation, with the intention of deception
* Rape/sexual assault
* Resisting arrest, &quot;e.g.&quot;, high-speed chase
* Robbery/Extortion
* Usurpation
* Tax evasion
* Threatening an official (police officer, judge)
* Treason
* Vandalism on federal property.

Some offenses, though similar in nature, may be felonies or misdemeanors depending on the circumstances. For example, the illegal manufacture, distribution or possession of controlled substances may be a felony, although possession of small amounts may be only a misdemeanor. Possession of a deadly weapon may be generally legal, but carrying the same weapon into a restricted area such as a school may be viewed as a serious offense, regardless of whether there is intent to use the weapon. Additionally, driving under the influence in some US states may be a misdemeanor if a first offense, but a felony on subsequent offenses.

=== Classification by seriousness ===
In much of the United States, all or most felonies are placed into one of various classes according to their seriousness and their potential punishment upon conviction. The number of classifications and the corresponding crimes vary by state and are determined by the legislature. Usually, the legislature also determines the maximum punishment allowable for each felony class; doing so avoids the necessity of defining specific sentences for every possible crime. For example:
* Virginia classifies most felonies by number, ranging from Class 6 (least severe: 1 to 5 years in prison or up to 12 months in jail) through Class 2 (20 years to life, &quot;e.g.&quot;, first-degree murder and aggravated malicious wounding) up to Class 1 (life imprisonment). Some felonies remain outside the classification system.
* New York State classifies felonies by letter, with some classes divided into sub-classes by a Roman numeral; classes range from Class E (encompassing the least severe felonies) through Classes D, C, B, and A–II up to Class A–I (encompassing the most severe).
* Massachusetts classifies a felony as an offense that carries any prison time.
* Ohio classifies felonies by degree ranging from first, second, third, fourth, to fifth degree. First-degree felonies are the most serious category, while fifth-degree felonies are the least serious. This is broadly the approach taken by the Model Penal Code, although the Code identifies only three degrees of felony.
* In Texas, all felonies are more severe than either infractions or misdemeanors and are classified in capital felonies, first degree felonies, second degree felonies, third degree felonies and State jail felonies.

Some felonies are classified as forcible or violent, typically because they contain some element of force or a threat of force against a person and are subject to additional penalties. Burglary is also classified as a forcible felony in some jurisdictions including Illinois and Florida.
:&quot;The common law divided participants in a felony into four basic categories: (1) first-degree principals, those who committed the crime in question; (2) second-degree principals, aiders and abettors present at the scene of the crime; (3) accessories before the fact, aiders and abettors who helped the principal before the basic criminal event took place; and (4) accessories after the fact, persons who helped the principal after the basic criminal event took place. In the course of the 20th century, however, American jurisdictions eliminated the distinction among the first three categories.&quot; &quot;Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez&quot;, (citations omitted).
===Consequences===
In many parts of the United States, a felon can experience long-term legal consequences persisting after the end of their imprisonment. The status and designation as a &quot;felon&quot; is considered permanent and is not extinguished upon sentence completion even if parole, probation or early release was given. The status can be cleared only by a successful appeal or executive clemency. However, felons may qualify for restoration of some rights after a certain period of time has passed.

The consequences felons experience in most states include:
* Disenfranchisement (expressly permitted by the Fourteenth Amendment, as noted by the Supreme Court in &quot;Richardson v. Ramirez&quot;)
* Exclusion from obtaining visas or professional licenses required to legally operate, making some vocations off limits to felons
* Ineligibility to hold office in a labor union (a provision of the Landrum–Griffin Act of 1959)
* Exclusion from purchase and possession of firearms, ammunition, and body armor
* Ineligibility to serve on a jury
* Ineligibility for government assistance or welfare
* Removal (deportation) (if not a citizen)

Additionally, many job applications and rental applications ask about felony history (a practice forbidden in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts), and answering dishonestly can be grounds for rejection of the application or termination of employment if the lie is discovered after hire. Convicted felons may not be eligible for certain professional licenses or bonds, while hiring them may raise the cost of an employer&#x27;s insurance. 

It is broadly legal to discriminate against felons in hiring and leasing decisions (although a blanket ban on renting to felons may violate federal housing law), so felons can face barriers to finding both jobs and housing. Moreover, a common term of parole agreements is to avoid association with other felons. In some neighborhoods with high rates of felony conviction, this creates a situation in which many felons live under a constant threat of being arrested for violating parole. Banks may refuse to issue loans to felons, and a felony conviction may prevent employment in banking or finance.

In some states, restoration of those rights depends on repayment of various fees associated with the felon&#x27;s arrest, processing, and prison stay, such as restitution to victims, or outstanding fines.

=== Restoration of rights ===

The primary means of restoring civil rights that are lost as a result of a felony conviction are executive clemency and expungement.

For state law convictions, expungement is determined by the law of the state. Many states do not allow expungement, regardless of the offense, though felons can seek pardons and clemency, potentially including restoration of rights.

Federal law does not have any provision for persons convicted of federal felonies in a federal United States district court to apply to have their record expunged. At present the only relief that an individual convicted of a felony in federal court may receive is a presidential pardon, which does not expunge the conviction, but rather grants relief from the civil disabilities that stem from it.

== Other jurisdictions ==

=== Cameroon ===
In the law of Cameroon, a felony is a crime for which the maximum sentence is more than 10 years, or death. Felonies are distinguished from misdemeanors (maximum sentence from 10 days to 10 years) and offenses (not exceeding 10 days). While lesser crimes are tried before a magistrate&#x27;s court, felonies must be tried before a high court (&quot;tribunal de grande instance&quot;).

The drafters of the bilingual Cameroonian penal code of 1967 based their work on French law and Nigerian law. In the case of felonies, they chose to set the threshold for felonies much higher than under either French law (five years) or Nigerian law (three years). This had the effect of greatly reducing the number of felonies under Cameroonian law. It also reduced the number of crimes that were subject to trial by jury in the courts of East Cameroon at that time.

===England and Wales===
====History====
Sir William Blackstone wrote in the 18th century that felony &quot;comprises every species of crime, which occasioned at common law the forfeiture of lands or goods&quot;. The word &quot;felony&quot; was feudal in origin, denoting the value of a man&#x27;s entire property: &quot;the consideration for which a man gives up his fief&quot;. Blackstone refutes the misconception that felony simply means an offense punishable by death, by demonstrating that not every felony is capital, and not every capital offense is a felony. However he concedes that &quot;the idea of felony is indeed so generally connected with that of capital punishment, that we find it hard to separate them; and to this usage the interpretations of the law do now conform.&quot;

The death penalty for felony could be avoided by pleading benefit of clergy, which gradually evolved to exempt everybody (whether clergy or not) from that punishment for a first offense, except for high treason and offenses expressly excluded by statute. During the 19th century criminal law reform incrementally reduced the number of capital offences (see Capital punishment in the United Kingdom), and forfeiture for felony was abolished by the Forfeiture Act 1870. Consequently, the distinction between felony and misdemeanor became increasingly arbitrary. The surviving differences consisted of different rules of evidence and procedure, and the Law Commission recommended that felonies be abolished altogether. This was done by the Criminal Law Act 1967, which set the criminal practice for all crimes as that of misdemeanor and introduced a new system of classifying crimes as either &quot;arrestable&quot; and &quot;non-arrestable&quot; offenses (according to which a general power of arrest was available for crimes punishable by five years&#x27; imprisonment or more).

Arrestable offenses were abolished in 2006, and today crimes are classified as indictable or summary offenses, the only distinction being the mode of trial (by jury in the Crown Court or summarily in a magistrates&#x27; court, respectively).

====Procedure====
The Trials for Felony Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4 c. 114) allowed persons indicted for felonies to be represented by counsel or attorney.

====Terminology====
A person being prosecuted for this was called a prisoner, though increasingly &quot;accused&quot; or &quot;defendant&quot; was preferred.

=== Germany ===
A felony (, a word also translated in less technical contexts as simply &quot;crime&quot;) is defined in the (Criminal Code, StGB) as an unlawful act () that is punishable with a minimum of one year&#x27;s imprisonment. A misdemeanor (&quot;Vergehen&quot;) is any other crime punishable by imprisonment with a minimum of less than one year or by fine.

However, in some cases a severe version of a misdemeanor may be punished with imprisonment of more than one year, yet the crime itself remains considered a misdemeanor. The same applies for a milder version of a felony that is punished with imprisonment less than a year.

An attempt to commit a felony is itself a crime, whereas an attempt to commit a misdemeanor is a crime only if specifically prescribed as such by law.

===Ireland===
In Irish law the distinction between felony and misdemeanor was abolished by section 3 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997, such that the law previously applied to misdemeanors was extended to all offenses. Minister Joan Burton, introducing the bill in the Seanad, said &quot;The distinction has been eroded over many years and in today&#x27;s conditions has no real relevance. Today, for example, serious offenses such as fraudulent conversion and obtaining property by false pretenses are classified as misdemeanors whereas a relatively trivial offense such as stealing a bar of chocolate is a felony.&quot; The 1997 Act, modeled on the English Criminal Law Act 1967, introduced the category of &quot;arrestable offense&quot; for those with penalties of five years&#x27; imprisonment or greater.

The 1937 Constitution declares that the parliamentary privilege, which protects Oireachtas members from arrest traveling to or from the legislature, does not apply to &quot;treason, felony, and breach of the peace&quot;. The 1996 Constitutional Review Group recommended replacing &quot;felony&quot; with &quot;serious criminal offence&quot;.
