<text>A film festival is an organized, extended presentation of films in one or more cinemas or screening venues, usually in a single city or region. Increasingly, film festivals show some films outdoors.

Films may be of recent date and depending upon the festival&#x27;s focus, can include international and domestic releases. Some film festivals focus on a specific filmmaker, genre of film, such as horror films, or subject matter. Several film festivals focus solely on presenting short films of a defined maximum length. Film festivals are typically annual events. Some film historians, including Jerry Beck, do not consider film festivals as official releases of the film.

The oldest film festival in the world is the Venice Film Festival. The most prestigious film festivals in the world, known as the &quot;Big Five&quot;, are (listed chronologically according to the date of foundation): Venice, Cannes, Berlin (the original &quot;Big Three&quot;), Toronto, and Sundance.

==History==

The Venice Film Festival in Italy began in 1932 and is the oldest film festival still running.

Mainland Europe&#x27;s biggest independent film festival is ÉCU The European Independent Film Festival, which started in 2006 and takes place every spring in Paris, France. Edinburgh International Film Festival is the longest-running festival in Great Britain as well as the longest continually running film festival in the world.

Australia&#x27;s first and longest-running film festival is the Melbourne International Film Festival (1952), followed by the Sydney Film Festival (1954).

North America&#x27;s first and longest-running short film festival is the Yorkton Film Festival, established in 1947. The first film festival in the United States was the Columbus International Film &amp; Video Festival, also known as The Chris Awards, held in 1953. According to the Film Arts Foundation in San Francisco, &quot;&quot;The Chris Awards&quot; (is) one of the most prestigious documentaries, educational, business and informational competitions in the U.S.; (it is) the oldest of its kind in North America and celebrating its 54th year&quot;. It was followed four years later by the San Francisco International Film Festival, held in March 1957, which emphasized feature-length dramatic films. The festival played a major role in introducing foreign films to American audiences. Films in the first year included Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; and Satyajit Ray&#x27;s .

Today, thousands of film festivals take place around the world—from high-profile festivals such as Sundance Film Festival (Park City, Utah), Newport Beach Film Festival, and Slamdance Film Festival, to horror festivals such as Terror Film Festival (Philadelphia), and the Park City Film Music Festival, the first U.S. film festival dedicated to honoring music in film.

Film Funding competitions such as Writers and Filmmakers were introduced when the cost of production could be lowered significantly, and internet technology allowed for the collaboration of film production.

Film festivals have evolved significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic. Many festivals opted for virtual or hybrid festivals. The film industry, which was already in upheaval due to streaming options, has faced another major shift, and movies showcased at festivals have an even shorter runway to online launches.

== Notable film festivals ==

== Festival administration ==
=== Business model ===
Although there are notable for-profit festivals such as SXSW, most festivals operate on a nonprofit membership-based model, with a combination of ticket sales, membership fees, and corporate sponsorship constituting the majority of revenue. Unlike other arts nonprofits (performing arts, museums, etc.), film festivals typically receive few donations from the general public and are occasionally organized as nonprofit business associations instead of public charities. Film industry members often have significant curatorial input, and corporate sponsors are given opportunities to promote their brand to festival audiences in exchange for cash contributions. Private parties, usually to raise investments for film projects, constitute significant &quot;fringe&quot; events. More prominent festivals maintain year-round staff frequently engaging in community and charitable projects outside the festival season.

=== Entry fee ===
While entries from established film professionals are usually considered pluses by the organizers, most festivals require new or relatively unknown filmmakers to pay an entry fee to have their works considered for screening. This is especially so in more significant film festivals, such as the Calcutta International Cult Films Festival in Kolkata Jaipur International Film Festival in Jaipur India, Toronto International Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, South by Southwest, Montreal World Film Festival, and even smaller &quot;boutique&quot; festivals such as the Miami International Film Festival, British Urban Film Festival in London and Mumbai Women&#x27;s International Film Festival in India.

On the other hand, some festivals—usually those accepting fewer films and perhaps not attracting as many big names in their audiences as do Sundance and Telluride, require no entry fee. Many smaller film festivals in the United States, such as the Stony Brook Film Festival on Long Island, the Northwest Filmmakers&#x27; Festival, and the Sicilian Film Festival in Miami), are examples.
The Portland International Film Festival charges an entry fee but waives it for filmmakers from the Northwestern United States, and some others with regional focuses have similar approaches.

Several film festival submission portal websites exist to streamline filmmakers&#x27; entries into multiple festivals. They provide databases of festival calls for entry and offer filmmakers a convenient &quot;describe once, submit many&quot; service.

=== Screening out of competition ===
The core tradition of film festivals is competition, or judging which films most deserve various forms of recognition. Some festivals, such as the famous Cannes Film Festival, may screen films that are considered close to competition-quality without being included in the competition; the films are said to be screened &quot;out of competition&quot;.

<text>The history of film chronicles the development of a visual art form created using film technologies that began in the late 19th century.

The advent of film as an artistic medium is not clearly defined. There were earlier cinematographic screenings by others like the first showing of life sized pictures in motion 1884 in Berlin by Ottomar Anschütz; however, the commercial, public screening of ten Lumière brothers&#x27; short films in Paris on 28 December 1895, can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures. The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long, without recorded sound, and consisted of a single shot from a steady camera. The first decade saw film move from a novelty, to an established mass entertainment industry, with film production companies and studios established throughout the world. Conventions toward a general cinematic language developed, with film editing, camera movements and other cinematic techniques contributing specific roles in the narrative of films.

Popular new media, including television (mainstream since the 1950s), home video (1980s), and the internet (1990s), influenced the distribution and consumption of films. Film production usually responded with content to fit the new media, and technical innovations (including widescreen (1950s), 3D, and 4D film) and more spectacular films to keep theatrical screenings attractive. Systems that were cheaper and more easily handled (including 8mm film, video, and smartphone cameras) allowed for an increasing number of people to create films of varying qualities, for any purpose including home movies and video art. The technical quality was usually lower than professional movies, but improved with digital video and affordable, high-quality digital cameras. Improving over time, digital production methods became more popular during the 1990s, resulting in increasingly realistic visual effects and popular feature-length computer animations.

Various film genres have emerged during the history of film, and enjoyed variable degrees of success.

== Precursors ==
The use of film as an art form traces its origins to several earlier traditions in the arts such as (oral) storytelling, literature, theatre and visual arts. Cantastoria and similar ancient traditions combined storytelling with series of images that were shown or indicated one after the other. Predecessors to film that had already used light and shadows to create art before the advent of modern film technology include shadowgraphy, shadow puppetry, camera obscura, and the magic lantern.

Shadowgraphy and shadow puppetry represent early examples of the intent to use moving imagery for entertainment and storytelling. Thought to have originated in the Far East, the art form used shadows cast by hands or objects to assist in the creation of narratives. Shadow puppetry enjoyed popularity for centuries around Asia, notably in Java, and eventually spread to Europe during the Age of Enlightenment.

By the 16th century, entertainers often conjured images of ghostly apparitions, using techniques such as camera obscura and other forms of projection to enhance their performances. Magic lantern shows developed in the latter half of the 17th century seem to have continued this tradition with images of death, monsters and other scary figures. Around 1790, this practice was developed into a type of multimedia ghost show known as phantasmagoria. These popular shows entertained audiences using mechanical slides, rear projection, mobile projectors, superimposition, dissolves, live actors, smoke (on which projections may have been cast), odors, sounds and even electric shocks. While many first magic lantern shows were intended to frighten viewers, advances by projectionists allowed for creative and even educational storytelling that could appeal to wider family audiences. Newly pioneered techniques such as the use of dissolving views and the chromatrope allowed for smoother transitions between two projected images and aided in providing stronger narratives.

In 1833, scientific study of a stroboscopic illusion in spoked wheels by Joseph Plateau, Michael Faraday and Simon Stampfer led to the invention of the Fantascope, also known as the stroboscopic disk or the phenakistiscope, which was popular in several European countries for a while. Plateau thought it could be further developed for use in phantasmagoria and Stampfer imagined a system for longer scenes with strips on rollers, as well as a transparent version (probably intended for projection). Plateau, Charles Wheatstone, Antoine Claudet and others tried to combine the technique with the stereoscope (introduced in 1838) and photography (introduced in 1839) for a more complete illusion of reality, but for decades such experiments were mostly hindered by the need for long exposure times, with motion blur around objects that moved while the reflected light fell on the photo-sensitive chemicals. A few people managed to get decent results from stop motion techniques, but these were only very rarely marketed and no form of animated photography had much cultural impact before the advent of chronophotography.

Most early photographic sequences, known as chronophotography, were not initially intended to be viewed in motion and were typically presented as a serious, even scientific, method of studying locomotion. The sequences almost exclusively involved humans or animals performing a simple movement in front of the camera. Starting in 1878 with the publication of &quot;The Horse in Motion&quot; cabinet cards, photographer Eadweard Muybridge began making hundreds of chronophotographic studies of the motion of animals and humans in real-time. He was soon followed by other chronophotographers like Étienne-Jules Marey, Georges Demenÿ, Albert Londe and Ottomar Anschütz. In 1879, Muybridge started lecturing on animal locomotion and used his Zoopraxiscope to project animations of the contours of his recordings, traced onto glass discs.

In 1887, the German inventor and photographer Ottomar Anschütz started presenting his chronophotographic recordings in motion, using a device he called the Elektrischen Schnellseher (also known as the Electrotachyscope), which displayed short loops on a small milk glass screen. By 1891, he had started mass production of a more economical, coin-operated peep-box viewing device of the same name that was exhibited at international exhibitions and fairs. Some machines were installed for longer periods, including some at The Crystal Palace in London, and in several U.S. stores. Shifting the focus of the medium from technical and scientific interest in motion to entertainment for the masses, he recorded wrestlers, dancers, acrobats, and scenes of everyday life. Nearly 34,000 people paid to see his shows at the Berlin Exhibition Park in summer 1892. Others saw it in London or at the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. Though little evidence remains for most of these recordings, some scenes probably depicted staged comical sequences. Extant records suggest some of his output directly influenced later works by the Edison Company, such as the 1894 film &quot;Fred Ott&#x27;s Sneeze&quot;.

Advances towards motion picture projection technologies were based on the popularity of magic lanterns, chronophotographic demonstrations, and other closely related forms of projected entertainment such as illustrated songs. From October 1892 to March 1900, inventor Émile Reynaud exhibited his Théâtre Optique (&quot;Optical Theatre&quot;) film system at the Musée Grévin in Paris. Reynaud&#x27;s device, which projected a series of animated stories such as &quot;Pauvre Pierrot&quot; and &quot;Autour d&#x27;une cabine&quot;, was displayed to over 500,000 visitors over the course of 12,800 shows. On 25, 29 and 30 November 1894, Ottomar Anschütz projected moving images from Electrotachyscope discs on a large screen in the darkened Grand Auditorium of a Post Office Building in Berlin, the first showing of life sized pictures in motion. From 22 February to 30 March 1895, a commercial 1.5-hour program of 40 different scenes was screened for audiences of 300 people at the old Reichstag and received circa 4,000 visitors.

== Novelty era (1890s – early 1900s) ==

=== Advances towards projection ===

Throughout the late 19th century, several inventors such as Wordsworth Donisthorpe, Louis Le Prince, William Friese-Greene, and the Skladanowsky brothers made pioneering contributions to the development of devices that could capture and display moving images, laying the groundwork for the emergence of cinema as an artistic medium. The scenes in these experiments primarily served to demonstrate the technology itself and were usually filmed with family, friends or passing traffic as the moving subjects. The earliest surviving film, known today as the &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot; (1888), was captured by Louis Le Prince and briefly depicted members of his family in motion.

In June 1889, American inventor Thomas Edison assigned a lab assistant, William Kennedy Dickson, to help develop a device that could produce visuals to accompany the sounds produced from the phonograph. Building upon previous machines by Muybridge, Marey, Anschütz and others, Dickson and his team created the Kinetoscope peep-box viewer, with celluloid loops containing about half a minute of motion picture entertainment. After an early preview on 20 May 1891, Edison introduced the machine in 1893. Many of the movies presented on the Kinetoscope showcased well-known vaudeville acts performing in Edison&#x27;s Black Maria studio. The Kinetoscope quickly became a global sensation with multiple viewing parlors across major cities by 1895. As the initial novelty of the images wore off, the Edison Company was slow to diversify their repertoire of films and waning public interest caused business to slow by Spring 1895. To remedy declining profits, experiments, such as &quot;The Dickson Experimental Sound Film&quot;, were conducted in an attempt to achieve the device&#x27;s original goal of providing visual accompaniment for sound recordings. Limitations in syncing the sound to the visuals, however, prevented widespread application. During that same period, inventors began advancing technologies towards film projection that would eventually overtake Edison&#x27;s peep-box format. 

The Skladanowsky brothers, used their self-made Bioscop to display the first moving picture show to a paying audience on 1 November 1895, in Berlin. But they did not have the quality or financial resources to acquire momentum. Most of these films never passed the experimental stage and their efforts garnered little public attention until after cinema had become successful.

In the latter half of 1895, brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière filmed a number of short scenes with their invention, the Cinématographe. On 28 December 1895, the brothers gave their first commercial screening in Paris (though evidence exists of demonstrations of the device to small audiences as early as October 1895). The screening consisted of ten films and lasted roughly 20 minutes. The program consisted mainly of actuality films such as &quot;Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory&quot; as truthful documents of the world, but the show also included the staged comedy &quot;L&#x27;Arroseur Arrosé&quot;. The most advanced demonstration of film projection thus far, the Cinématographe was an instant success, bringing in an average of 2,500 to 3,000 francs daily by the end of January 1896. Following the first screening, the order and selection of films were changed often.

The Lumière brothers&#x27; primary business interests were in selling cameras and film equipment to exhibitors, not the actual production of films. Despite this, filmmakers across the world were inspired by the potential of film as exhibitors brought their shows to new countries. This era of filmmaking, dubbed by film historian Tom Gunning as &quot;the cinema of attractions&quot;, offered a relatively cheap and simple way of providing entertainment to the masses. Rather than focusing on stories, Gunning argues, filmmakers mainly relied on the ability to delight audiences through the &quot;illusory power&quot; of viewing sequences in motion, much as they did in the Kinetoscope era that preceded it. Despite this, early experimentation with fiction filmmaking (both in actuality film and other genres) did occur. Films were mostly screened inside temporary storefront spaces, in tents of traveling exhibitors at fairs, or as &quot;dumb&quot; acts in vaudeville programs. During this period, before the process of post-production was clearly defined, exhibitors were allowed to exercise their creative freedom in their presentations. To enhance the viewers&#x27; experience, some showings were accompanied by live musicians in an orchestra, a theatre organ, live sound effects and commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist.
Experiments in film editing, special effects, narrative construction, and camera movement during this period by filmmakers in France, England, and the United States became influential in establishing an identity for film going forward. At both the Edison and Lumière studios, loose narratives such as the 1895 Edison film, &quot;Washday Troubles,&quot; established short relationship dynamics and simple storylines. In 1896, &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot; (&quot;The Fairy of the Cabbages&quot;) was first released. Directed and edited by Alice Guy, the story is arguably the earliest narrative film in history, as well as the first film to be directed by a woman. That same year, the Edison Manufacturing Company released &quot;The May Irwin Kiss&quot; in May to widespread financial success. The film, which featured the first kiss in cinematic history, led to the earliest known calls for film censorship.

Another early film producer was Australia&#x27;s Limelight Department. Commencing in 1898, it was operated by The Salvation Army in Melbourne, Australia. The Limelight Department produced evangelistic material for use by the Salvation Army, including lantern slides as early as 1891, as well as private and government contracts. In its nineteen years of operation, the Limelight Department produced about 300 films of various lengths, making it one of largest film producers of its time. The Limelight Department made a 1904 film by Joseph Perry called Bushranging in North Queensland, which is believed to be the first ever film about bushrangers.

=== Proliferation of actualities and newsreels ===
In its infancy, film was rarely recognized as an art form by presenters or audiences. Regarded by the upper class as a &quot;vulgar&quot; and &quot;lowbrow&quot; form of cheap entertainment, films largely appealed to the working class and were often too short to hold any strong narrative potential. Initial advertisements promoted the technologies used to screen films rather than the films themselves. As the devices became more familiar to audiences, their potential for capturing and recreating events was exploited primarily in the form of newsreels and actualities. During the creation of these films, cinematographers often drew upon aesthetic values established by past art forms such as framing and the intentional placement of the camera in the composition of their image. In a 1955 article for &quot;The Quarterly of Film Radio and television,&quot; film producer and historian Kenneth Macgowan asserted that the intentional staging and recreation of events for newsreels &quot;brought storytelling to the screen&quot;.

With the advertisement of film technologies over content, actualities initially began as a &quot;series of views&quot; that often contained shots of beautiful and lively places or performance acts. Following the success of their 1895 screening, The Lumière brothers established a company and sent cameramen across the world to capture new subjects for presentation. After the cinematographer shot scenes, they often exhibited their recordings locally and then sent them back to the company factory in Lyon to make duplicate prints for sale to whoever wanted them. In the process of filming actualities, especially those of real events, filmmakers discovered and experimented with multiple camera techniques to accommodate for their unpredictable nature. Due to the short length (often only one shot) of many actualities, catalogue records indicate that production companies marketed to exhibitors by promoting multiple actualities with related subject matters that could be purchased to complement each other. Exhibitors who bought the films often presented them in a program and would provide spoken accompaniment to explain the action on screen to audiences.

The first paying audience for a motion picture gathered at Madison Square Garden to see a staged actuality that purported itself to be a boxing fight filmed by Woodville Latham using a device called the Eidoloscope on May 20, 1895. Commissioned by Latham, the French inventor Eugene Augustin Lauste created the device with additional expertise from William Kennedy Dickson and crafted a mechanism that came to be known as the Latham loop, which allowed for longer continuous runtimes and was less abrasive on the celluloid film.

In subsequent years, screenings of actualities and newsreels proved to be profitable. In 1897, &quot;The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight&quot; was released. The film was a complete recording of a heavyweight world championship boxing match at Carson City, Nevada. It generated more income in box office than in live gate receipts and was the longest film produced at the time. Audiences had probably been drawn to the Corbett-Fitzsimmons film en masse because James J. Corbett (a.k.a. Gentleman Jim) had become a matinee idol since he had played a fictionalized version of himself in a stage play.

From 1910 on, regular newsreels were exhibited and soon became a popular way of discovering the news before the advent of television the British Antarctic Expedition to the South Pole was filmed for the newsreels as were the suffragette demonstrations that were happening at the same time. F. Percy Smith was an early nature documentary pioneer working for Charles Urban when he pioneered the use of time lapse and micro cinematography in his 1910 documentary on the growth of flowers.

===Experimentation with narrative filmmaking===

==== France: Georges Méliès, Pathé Frères, Gaumont Film Company ====
Following the successful exhibition of the Cinématographe, development of a motion picture industry rapidly accelerated in France. Multiple filmmakers experimented with the technology as they worked to attain the same success that the Lumière brothers had with their screening. These filmmakers established new companies such as the Star Film Company, Pathé Frères, and the Gaumont Film Company.

The most widely cited progenitor of narrative filmmaking is the French filmmaker, Georges Méliès. Méliès was an illusionist who had previously used magic lantern projections to enhance his magic act. In 1895, Méliès attended the demonstration of the Cinematographe and recognized the potential of the device to aid his act. He attempted to buy a device from the Lumière brothers, but they refused. Months later, he bought a camera from Robert W. Paul and began experiments with the device by creating actualities. During this period of experimentation, Méliès discovered and implemented various special effects including the stop trick, the multiple exposure, and the use of dissolves in his films. At the end of 1896, Méliès established the Star Film Company and started producing, directing, and distributing a body of work that would eventually contain over 500 short films. Recognizing the narrative potential afforded by combining his theater background with the newly discovered effects for the camera, Méliès designed an elaborate stage that contained trapdoors and a fly system. The stage construction and editing techniques allowed for the development of more complex stories, such as the 1896 film, &quot;Le Manoir du Diable&quot; (&quot;The House of the Devil&quot;), regarded as a first in the horror film genre, and the 1899 film &quot;Cendrillon&quot; (&quot;Cinderella&quot;). In Méliès&#x27; films, he based the placement of the camera on the theatrical construct of proscenium framing, the metaphorical plane or fourth wall that divides the actors and the audience. Throughout his career, Méliès consistently placed the camera in a fixed position and eventually fell out of favor with audiences as other filmmakers experimented with more complex and creative techniques. Méliès is most widely known today for his 1902 film, &quot;Le Voyage Dans La Lune (A Trip to the Moon)&quot;, where he used his expertise in effects and narrative construction to create the first science fiction film.

In 1900, Charles Pathé began film production under the Pathé-Frères brand, with Ferdinand Zecca hired to lead the creative process. Prior to this focus on production, Pathé had become involved with the industry by exhibiting and selling what were likely counterfeit versions of the Kinetoscope in his phonograph shop. With the creative leadership of Zecca and the capability to mass-produce copies of the films through a partnership with a French toolmaking company, Charles Pathé sought to make Pathé-Frères the leading film producer in the country. Within the next few years, Pathé-Frères became the largest film studio in the world, with satellite offices in major cities and an expanding selection of films available for presentation. The company&#x27;s films were varied in content, with directors specializing in various genres for fairground presentations throughout the early 1900s.

The Gaumont Film Company was the main regional rival of Pathé-Frères. Founded in 1895 by Léon Gaumont, the firm initially sold photographic equipment and began film production in 1897, under the direction of Alice Guy, the industry&#x27;s first female director. Her earlier films share many characteristics and themes with her contemporary competitors, such as the Lumières and Méliès. She explored dance and travel films, often combining the two, such as &quot;Le Boléro&quot; performed by Miss Saharet (1905) and &quot;Tango&quot; (1905). Many of Guy&#x27;s early dance films were popular in music-hall attractions such as the serpentine dance films – also a staple of the Lumières and Thomas Edison film catalogs. In 1906, she made &quot;The Life of Christ&quot;, a big-budget production for the time, which included 300 extras.

==== Germany: Oskar Messter ====

German inventor and film tycoon Oskar Messter was an important figure in the early years of cinema. His firm Messter Film was one of the dominant German producers before the rise of UFA, with which it merged eventually. Messter first added a Geneva drive on the projectors to oscillatingly cause intermittent movement to advance the frames of the film and he set up the first film studio in Germany in 1900.

From 1896, Messter was interested in the search of a method of reproduction and synchronization of the sound effects of the cinematographic performance at the time of the silent movies. So Messter invented the Tonbilder Biophon to show films, in which a gramophone played Unter den Linden accompanying the projection of animated images, but it was not a simple add on but to precisely match the series of musical pieces with moving images. In effect, to add sound to the silent cinema, it was necessary to solve problems of synchronization, since the image and the sound were recorded and reproduced by separated devices, which were difficult to initiate and to maintain rigged. On August 31, 1903, Messter held the first sound projection that took place in Germany at the &quot;Apollo&quot; Theater in Berlin.

==== England: Robert W Paul, Cecil Hepworth, The Brighton School ====
Both Cecil Hepworth and Robert W. Paul experimented with the use of different camera techniques in their films. Paul&#x27;s &#x27;Cinematograph Camera No. 1&#x27; of 1895 was the first camera to feature reverse-cranking, which allowed the same film footage to be exposed several times, thereby creating multiple exposures. This technique was first used in his 1901 film &quot;Scrooge, or, Marley&#x27;s Ghost&quot;. Both filmmakers experimented with the speeds of the camera to generate new effects. Paul shot scenes from &quot;On a Runaway Motor Car through Piccadilly Circus&quot; (1899) by cranking the camera apparatus very slowly. When the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second, the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed. Hepworth used the opposite effect in &quot;The Indian Chief and the Seidlitz Powder&quot; (1901). The Chief&#x27;s movements are sped up by cranking the camera much faster than 16 frames per second, producing what modern audiences would call a &quot;slow motion&quot; effect.

The first films to move from single shots to successive scenes began around the turn of the 20th century. Due to the loss of many early films, a conclusive shift from static singular shots to a series of scenes can be hard to determine. Despite these limitations, Michael Brooke of the British Film Institute attributes real film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, to Robert W. Paul&#x27;s 1898 film, &quot;Come Along, Do!&quot;. Only a still from the second shot remains extant today. Released in 1901, the British film &quot;Attack on a China Mission&quot; was one of the first films to show a continuity of action across multiple scenes. The use of the intertitle to explain actions and dialogue on screen began in the early 1900s. Filmed intertitles were first used in Robert W. Paul&#x27;s film, &quot;Scrooge, or Marley&#x27;s Ghost.&quot; In most countries, intertitles gradually came to be used to provide dialogue and narration for the film, thus dispensing the need for narration provided by exhibitors.

Development of continuous action across multiple shots was furthered in England by a loosely associated group of film pioneers collectively termed &quot;the Brighton School&quot;. These filmmakers included George Albert Smith and James Williamson, among others. Smith and Williamson experimented with action continuity and were likely the first to incorporate the use of inserts and close-ups between shots. A basic technique for trick cinematography was the double exposure of the film in the camera. The effect was pioneered by Smith in the 1898 film, &quot;Photographing a Ghost&quot;. According to Smith&#x27;s catalogue records, the (now lost) film chronicles a photographer&#x27;s struggle to capture a ghost on camera. Using the double exposure of the film, Smith overlaid a transparent ghostly figure onto the background in a comical manner to taunt the photographer. Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Corsican Brothers&quot; was described in the catalogue of the Warwick Trading Company in 1900: &quot;By extremely careful photography the ghost appears *quite transparent*. After indicating that he has been killed by a sword-thrust, and appealing for vengeance, he disappears. A &#x27;vision&#x27; then appears showing the fatal duel in the snow.&quot; Smith also initiated the special effects technique of reverse motion. He did this by repeating the action a second time, while filming it with an inverted camera, and then joining the tail of the second negative to that of the first. The first films made using this device were &quot;Tipsy, Topsy, Turvy&quot; and &quot;The Awkward Sign Painter&quot;. The earliest surviving example of this technique is Smith&#x27;s &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot;, made before September 1900. Cecil Hepworth took this technique further by printing the negatives of the forward motion in reverse frame by frame, producing a print in which the original action was exactly reversed. To do this he built a special printer in which the negative running through a projector was projected into the gate of a camera through a special lens giving a same-size image. This arrangement came to be called a &quot;projection printer&quot;, and eventually an &quot;optical printer&quot;.

In 1898, George Albert Smith experimented with close-ups, filming shots of a man drinking beer and a woman using sniffing tobacco. The following year, Smith made &quot;The Kiss in the Tunnel,&quot; a sequence consisting of three shots: a train enters a tunnel; a man and a woman exchange a brief kiss in the darkness and then return to their seats; the train exits the tunnel. Smith created the scenario in response to the success of a genre known as a phantom ride. In a phantom ride film, cameras would capture the motion and surroundings from the front of a moving train. The separate shots, when edited together, formed a distinct sequence of events and established causality from one shot to the next. Following &quot;The Kiss in the Tunnel&quot;, Smith more definitively experimented with continuity of action across successive shots and began using inserts in his films, such as &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Reading Glass&quot; and &quot;Mary Jane&#x27;s Mishap&quot;. In 1900, Smith made &quot;As Seen Through a Telescope.&quot; The main shot shows a street scene with a young man tying the shoelace and then caressing the foot of his girlfriend, while an old man observes this through a telescope. There is then a cut to close shot of the hands on the girl&#x27;s foot shown inside a black circular mask, and then a cut back to the continuation of the original scene.

James Williamson perfected narrative building techniques in his 1900 film, &quot;Attack on a China Mission&quot;. The film, which film historian John Barnes later described as having &quot;the most fully developed narrative of any film made in England up to that time&quot;, opens as the first shot shows Chinese Boxer rebels at the gate; it then cuts to the missionary family in the garden, where a fight ensues. The wife signals to British sailors from the balcony, who come and rescue them. The film also used the first &quot;reverse angle&quot; cut in film history. The following year, Williamson created &quot;The Big Swallow&quot;. In the film. a man becomes irritated by the presence of the filmmaker and &quot;swallows&quot; the camera and its operator through the use of interpolated close-up shots. He combined these effects, along with superimpositions, use of wipe transitions to denote a scene change, and other techniques to create a film language, or &quot;film grammar&quot;. James Williamson&#x27;s use of continuous action in his 1901 film, &quot;Stop Thief!&quot; stimulated a film genre known as the &quot;chase film.&quot; In the film, a tramp steals a leg of mutton from a butcher&#x27;s boy in the first shot, is chased by the butcher&#x27;s boy and assorted dogs in the following shot, and is finally caught by the dogs in the third shot.

==== United States: The Edison Company and Edwin S. Porter ====

&quot;The Execution of Mary Stuart&quot;, produced in 1895 by the Edison Company for viewing with the Kinetoscope, showed Mary Queen of Scots being executed in full view of the camera. The effect, known as the stop trick, was achieved by replacing the actor with a dummy for the final shot. The technique used in the film is seen as one of the earliest known uses of special effects in film.

The American filmmaker Edwin S. Porter started making films for the Edison Company in 1901. A former projectionist hired by Thomas Edison to develop his new projection model known as the Vitascope, Porter was inspired in part by the works of Méliès, Smith, and Williamson and drew upon their newly crafted techniques to further the development of continuous narrative through editing. When he began making longer films in 1902, he put a dissolve between every shot, just as Georges Méliès was already doing, and he frequently had the same action repeated across the dissolves.

In 1902, Porter shot &quot;Life of an American Fireman&quot; for the Edison Manufacturing Company and distributed the film the following year. In the film, Porter combined stock footage from previous Edison films with newly shot footage and spliced them together to convey a dramatic story of the rescue of a woman and her child by heroic firemen.

Porter&#x27;s film, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903), had a running time of twelve minutes, with twenty separate shots and ten different indoor and outdoor locations. The film is seen as a first in the Western film genre and is significant for the use of shots suggesting simultaneous action occurring at different locations. Porter&#x27;s use of both staged and real outdoor environments helped to create a sense of space while the placement of the camera in a wider shot established depth and allowed for an extended duration of motion on screen. &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; served as one of the vehicles that would launch the film medium into mass popularity. That same year, the Miles Brothers opened the first film exchange in the country, which allowed permanent exhibitors to rent films from the company at a lower cost than the producers that sold their films outright.

John P. Harris opened the first permanent theater devoted exclusively to the presentation of films, the nickelodeon, in 1905 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The idea rapidly took off and by 1908, there were around 8,000 nickelodeon theaters across the country. With the arrival of the nickelodeon, audience demand for a larger quantity of story films with a variety of subjects and locations led to a need to hire more creative talent and caused studios to invest in more elaborate stage designs.

In 1908, Thomas Edison spearheaded the creation of a corporate trust between the major film companies in America known as the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC) to limit infringement on his patents. Members of the trust controlled every aspect of the filmmaking process from the creation of film stock, the production of films, and the distribution to cinemas through licensing arrangements. The trust led to increased quality filmmaking spurred by internal competition and placed limits on the number of foreign films to encourage the growth of the American film industry, but it also discouraged the creation of feature films. By 1915, the MPPC had lost most of its hold on the film industry as the companies moved towards the wider production of feature films.

== Continued international growth (1900s–1910s) ==

===New film producing countries===

With the worldwide film boom, more countries now joined Britain, France, Germany and the United States in serious film production. In Italy, production was spread over several centers, Turin was the first major film production centre, and Milan and Naples gave birth to the first film magazines. In Turin, Ambrosio was the first company in the field in 1905, and remained the largest in the country through this period. Its most substantial rival was Cines in Rome, which started producing in 1906. The great strength of the Italian industry was historical epics, with large casts and massive scenery. As early as 1911, Giovanni Pastrone&#x27;s two-reel &quot;La Caduta di Troia (The Fall of Troy)&quot; made a big impression worldwide, and it was followed by even bigger productions like &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot; (1912), which ran for 90 minutes, and Pastrone&#x27;s &quot;Cabiria&quot; of 1914, which ran for two and a half hours.

Italian companies also had a strong line in slapstick comedy, with actors like André Deed, known locally as &quot;Cretinetti&quot;, and elsewhere as &quot;Foolshead&quot; and &quot;Gribouille&quot;, achieving worldwide fame with his almost surrealistic gags.

The most important film-producing country in Northern Europe up until the First World War was Denmark. The Nordisk company was set up there in 1906 by Ole Olsen, a fairground showman, and after a brief period imitating the successes of French and British filmmakers, in 1907 he produced 67 films, most directed by Viggo Larsen, with sensational subjects like &quot;Den hvide Slavinde (The White Slave)&quot;, &quot;Isbjørnejagt (Polar Bear Hunt)&quot; and &quot;Løvejagten (The Lion Hunt)&quot;. By 1910, new smaller Danish companies began joining the business, and besides making more films about the white slave trade, they contributed other new subjects. The most important of these finds was Asta Nielsen in &quot;Afgrunden (The Abyss)&quot;, directed by Urban Gad for Kosmorama, This combined the circus, sex, jealousy and murder, all put over with great conviction, and pushed the other Danish filmmakers further in this direction. By 1912, the Danish film companies were multiplying rapidly.

The Swedish film industry was smaller and slower to get started than the Danish industry. Here, Charles Magnusson, a newsreel cameraman for the Svenskabiografteatern cinema chain, started fiction film production for them in 1909, directing a number of the films himself. Production increased in 1912, when the company engaged Victor Sjöström and Mauritz Stiller as directors. They started out by imitating the subjects favoured by the Danish film industry, but by 1913 they were producing their own strikingly original work, which sold very well.

Russia began its film industry in 1908 with Pathé shooting some fiction subjects there, and then the creation of real Russian film companies by Aleksandr Drankov and Aleksandr Khanzhonkov. The Khanzhonkov company quickly became much the largest Russian film company, and remained so until 1918.

In Germany, Oskar Messter had been involved in film-making from 1896, but did not make a significant number of films per year until 1910. When the worldwide film boom started, he, and the few other people in the German film business, continued to sell prints of their own films outright, which put them at a disadvantage. It was only when Paul Davidson, the owner of a chain of cinemas, brought Asta Nielsen and Urban Gad to Germany from Denmark in 1911, and set up a production company, Projektions-AG &quot;Union&quot; (PAGU), that a change-over to renting prints began. Messter replied with a series of longer films starring Henny Porten, but although these did well in the German-speaking world, they were not particularly successful internationally, unlike the Asta Nielsen films. Another of the growing German film producers just before World War I was the German branch of the French Éclair company, Deutsche Éclair. This was expropriated by the German government, and turned into DECLA when the war started. But altogether, German producers only had a minor part of the German market in 1914.

Overall, from about 1910, American films had the largest share of the market in all European countries except France, and even in France, the American films had just pushed the local production out of first place on the eve of World War I. Pathé Frères expanded and significantly shaped the American film business, creating many &quot;firsts&quot; in the film industry, such as adding titles and subtitles to films for the first time, releasing scrolls for the first time, introducing film posters for the first time, producing color pictures for the first time, taking out commercial bills for the first time, contacting exhibitors and studying their needs for the first time. The world&#x27;s largest film supplier, Pathé, is limited to the U.S. market, which has reached a saturation level, so the U.S. seeks additional profits from foreign markets. Movies are defined as &quot;pure&quot; American phenomenon in the United States.

===Film technique===

New film techniques that were introduced in this period include the use of artificial lighting, fire effects and low-key lighting (i.e. lighting in which most of the frame is dark) for enhanced atmosphere during sinister scenes.

Continuity of action from shot to shot was also refined, such as in Pathé&#x27;s &quot;le Cheval emballé (The Runaway Horse)&quot; (1907) where cross-cutting between parallel actions is used. D. W. Griffith also began using cross-cutting in the film &quot;The Fatal Hour&quot;, made in July 1908. Another development was the use of the point of view shot, first used in 1910 in Vitagraph&#x27;s &quot;Back to Nature&quot;. Insert shots were also used for artistic purposes; the Italian film &quot;La mala planta (The Evil Plant)&quot;, directed by Mario Caserini had an insert shot of a snake slithering over the &quot;Evil Plant&quot;. By 1914 it was widely held in the American film industry that cross-cutting was most generally useful because it made possible the elimination of uninteresting parts of the action that play no part in advancing the drama.

In 1909, 35mm became the internationally recognized theatrical film gauge.

As films grew longer, specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel. Genres began to be used as categories; the main division was into comedy and drama, but these categories were further subdivided.

Intertitles containing lines of dialogue began to be used consistently from 1908 onwards, such as in Vitagraph&#x27;s &quot;An Auto Heroine; or, The Race for the Vitagraph Cup and How It Was Won&quot;. The dialogue was eventually inserted into the middle of the scene and became commonplace by 1912. The introduction of dialogue titles transformed the nature of film narrative. When dialogue titles came to be always cut into a scene just after a character starts speaking, and then left with a cut to the character just before they finish speaking, then one had something that was effectively the equivalent of a present-day sound film.

===During World War I and industry===
The years of the First World War were a complex transitional period for the film industry. The exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programmes to feature films. Exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices.

In the United States, these changes brought destruction to many film companies, the Vitagraph company being an exception. Film production began to shift to Los Angeles during World War I. The Universal Film Manufacturing Company was formed in 1912 as an umbrella company. New entrants included the Jesse Lasky Feature Play Company, and Famous Players, both formed in 1913, and later amalgamated into Famous Players–Lasky. The biggest success of these years was David Wark Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915). Griffith followed this up with the even bigger &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916), but, due to the high quality of film produced in the US, the market for their films was high.

In France, film production shut down due to the general military mobilization of the country at the start of the war. Although film production began again in 1915, it was on a reduced scale, and the biggest companies gradually retired from production. Italian film production held up better, although so called &quot;diva films&quot;, starring anguished female leads were a commercial failure. In Denmark, the Nordisk company increased its production so much in 1915 and 1916 that it could not sell all its films, which led to a very sharp decline in Danish production, and the end of Denmark&#x27;s importance on the world film scene.

The German film industry was seriously weakened by the war. The most important of the new film producers at the time was Joe May, who made a series of thrillers and adventure films through the war years, but Ernst Lubitsch also came into prominence with a series of very successful comedies and dramas.

===New techniques===
At this time, studios were blacked out to allow shooting to be unaffected by changing sunlight. This was replaced with floodlights and spotlights. The widespread adoption of irising-in and out to begin and end scenes caught on in this period. This is the revelation of a film shot in a circular mask, which gradually gets larger until it expands beyond the frame. Other shaped slits were used, including vertical and diagonal apertures.

A new idea taken over from still photography was &quot;soft focus&quot;. This began in 1915, with some shots being intentionally thrown out of focus for expressive effect, as in Mary Pickford starrer &quot;Fanchon the Cricket&quot;.

It was during this period that camera effects intended to convey the subjective feelings of characters in a film really began to be established. These could now be done as Point of View (POV) shots, as in Sidney Drew&#x27;s &quot;The Story of the Glove&quot; (1915), where a wobbly hand-held shot of a door and its keyhole represents the POV of a drunken man. The use of anamorphic (in the general sense of distorted shape) images first appears in these years when Abel Gance directed &quot;la Folie du Docteur Tube (The Madness of Dr. Tube)&quot;. In this film the effect of a drug administered to a group of people was suggested by shooting the scenes reflected in a distorting mirror of the fair-ground type.

Symbolic effects taken over from conventional literary and artistic tradition continued to make some appearances in films during these years. In D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Avenging Conscience&quot; (1914), the title &quot;The birth of the evil thought&quot; precedes a series of three shots of the protagonist looking at a spider, and ants eating an insect. Symbolist art and literature from the turn of the century also had a more general effect on a small number of films made in Italy and Russia. The supine acceptance of death resulting from passion and forbidden longings was a major feature of this art, and states of delirium dwelt on at length were important as well.
The use of insert shots, i.e. close-ups of objects other than faces, had already been established by the Brighton school, but were infrequently used before 1914. It is really only with Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Avenging Conscience&quot; that a new phase in the use of the Insert Shot starts. As well as the symbolic inserts already mentioned, the film also made extensive use of large numbers of Big Close Up shots of clutching hands and tapping feet as a means of emphasizing those parts of the body as indicators of psychological tension.

Atmospheric inserts were developed in Europe in the late 1910s. This kind of shot is one in a scene which neither contains any of the characters in the story, nor is a Point of View shot seen by one of them. An early example is when Maurice Tourneur directed &quot;The Pride of the Clan&quot; (1917), in which there is a series of shots of waves beating on a rocky shore to demonstrate the harsh lives of the fishing folk. Maurice Elvey&#x27;s &quot;Nelson; The Story of England&#x27;s Immortal Naval Hero&quot; (1919) has a symbolic sequence dissolving from a picture of Kaiser Wilhelm II to a peacock, and then to a battleship.

By 1914, continuity cinema was the established mode of commercial cinema. One of the advanced continuity techniques involved an accurate and smooth transition from one shot to another. Cutting to &quot;different&quot; angles within a scene also became well-established as a technique for dissecting a scene into shots in American films. If the direction of the shot changes by more than ninety degrees, it is called a reverse-angle cutting. The leading figure in the full development of reverse-angle cutting was Ralph Ince in his films, such as &quot;The Right Girl&quot; and &quot;His Phantom Sweetheart&quot;.

The use of flash-back structures continued to develop in this period, with the usual way of entering and leaving a flash-back being through a dissolve. The Vitagraph Company&#x27;s &quot;The Man That Might Have Been&quot; (William J. Humphrey, 1914), is even more complex, with a series of reveries and flash-backs that contrast the protagonist&#x27;s real passage through life with what might have been, if his son had not died.

After 1914, cross cutting between parallel actions came to be used more so in American films than in European ones. Cross-cutting was used to get new effects of contrast, such as the cross-cut sequence in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Whispering Chorus&quot; (1918), in which a supposedly dead husband is having a liaison with a Chinese prostitute in an opium den, while simultaneously his unknowing wife is being remarried in church.

Silent film tinting, too, gained popularity during these periods. Amber tinting meant daytime, or vividly-lit nighttime, blue tints meant dawn or dimly-lit night, red tinting represented fire scenes, green tinting meant a mysterious atmosphere, and brown tints (aka sepia toning) were used usually for full-length films instead of individual scenes. D.W. Griffiths&#x27; &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), John S. Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1920), and the Robert Wiene&#x27;s &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920) are some notable examples of tinted silent films.

&quot;The Photo-Drama of Creation&quot;, first shown to audiences in 1914, was the first major screenplay to incorporate synchronized sound, moving film, and color slides. Until 1927, most motion pictures were produced without sound. This period is commonly referred to as the silent era of film.

===Film art===

The general trend in the development of cinema, led from the United States, was towards using the newly developed specifically filmic devices for expression of the narrative content of film stories, and combining this with the standard dramatic structures already in use in commercial theatre. D. W. Griffith had the highest standing among American directors in the industry, because of the dramatic excitement he conveyed to the audience through his films. Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Cheat&quot; (1915), brought out the moral dilemmas facing their characters in a more subtle way than Griffith. DeMille was also in closer touch with the reality of contemporary American life. Maurice Tourneur was also highly ranked for the pictorial beauties of his films, together with the subtlety of his handling of fantasy, while at the same time he was capable of getting greater naturalism from his actors at appropriate moments, as in &quot;A Girl&#x27;s Folly&quot; (1917).

Sidney Drew was the leader in developing &quot;polite comedy&quot;, while slapstick was refined by Fatty Arbuckle and Charles Chaplin, who both started with Mack Sennett&#x27;s Keystone company. They reduced the usual frenetic pace of Sennett&#x27;s films to give the audience a chance to appreciate the subtlety and finesse of their movement, and the cleverness of their gags. By 1917 Chaplin was also introducing more dramatic plot into his films, and mixing the comedy with sentiment.

In Russia, Yevgeni Bauer put a slow intensity of acting combined with Symbolist overtones onto film in a unique way.

In Sweden, Victor Sjöström made a series of films that combined the realities of people&#x27;s lives with their surroundings in a striking manner, while Mauritz Stiller developed sophisticated comedy to a new level.

In Germany, Ernst Lubitsch got his inspiration from the stage work of Max Reinhardt, both in bourgeois comedy and in spectacle, and applied this to his films, culminating in his &quot;die Puppe&quot; (&quot;The Doll&quot;), &quot;die Austernprinzessin&quot; (&quot;The Oyster Princess&quot;) and &quot;Madame DuBarry&quot;.

==1920s==
===Golden years of European cinema, Hollywood triumphant===
At the start of the First World War, French and Italian cinema had been the most globally popular. The war came as a devastating interruption to European film industries.

Throughout the early 20th century, screen artists continued to learn how to work with cameras and create illusions using space and time in their shots. This newly introduced form of creativity made way for a whole new group of people to be introduced to stardom, including David W. Griffith, who made a name for himself with his 1915 film, &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. In 1920, there were two major changes to the film industry: the introduction of sound and the creation of studio systems. In the 1920s, talent who had been working independently began joining studios and working with other actors and directors. In 1927, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was released, bringing sound to the motion picture industry.
The German cinema, marked by those times, saw the era of the German Expressionist film movement. Berlin was its center with the Filmstudio Babelsberg. The first Expressionist films made up for a lack of lavish budgets by using set designs with wildly non-realistic, geometrically absurd angles, along with designs painted on walls and floors to represent lights, shadows, and objects. The plots and stories of the Expressionist films often dealt with madness, insanity, betrayal and other &quot;intellectual&quot; topics triggered by the experiences of World War I. Films like &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920), &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922) and &quot;M&quot; (1931) had a large international influence that can still be recognised in the works of current filmmakers, game designers and artists.

Movies like &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927) and &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot; (1929) partly created the genre of science fiction films and Lotte Reiniger became a pioneer in animation, producing animated feature films like The Adventures of Prince Achmed, the oldest surviving and oldest European made animated movie.

Many German and German-based directors, actors, writers and others emigrated to the US when the Nazis gained power, giving Hollywood and the American film industry the final edge in its competition with other movie producing countries.

The American industry, or &quot;Hollywood&quot;, as it was becoming known after its new geographical center in California, gained the position it has held, more or less, ever since: film factory for the world and exporting its product to most countries on earth.

By the 1920s, the United States reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output, producing an average of 800 &quot;feature&quot; films annually, or 82% of the global total (Eyman, 1997). The comedies of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, the swashbuckling adventures of Douglas Fairbanks and the romances of Clara Bow, to cite just a few examples, made these performers&#x27; faces well known on every continent. The Western visual norm that would become classical continuity editing was developed and exported – although its adoption was slower in some non-Western countries without strong realist traditions in art and drama, such as Japan.

This development was contemporary with the growth of the studio system and its greatest publicity method, the star system, which characterized American film for decades to come and provided models for other film industries. The studios&#x27; efficient, top-down control over all stages of their product enabled a new and ever-growing level of lavish production and technical sophistication. At the same time, the system&#x27;s commercial regimentation and focus on glamorous escapism discouraged daring and ambition beyond a certain degree, a prime example being the brief but still legendary directing career of the iconoclastic Erich von Stroheim in the late teens and the 1920s.

In 1924, Sam Goldwyn, Louis B. Mayer, and the Metro Pictures Corporation create MGM.

==1930s==
===Sound era===


During late 1927, Warners released &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, which was mostly silent but contained what is generally regarded as the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film; however, this process was actually accomplished first by Charles Taze Russell in 1914 with the lengthy film &quot;The Photo-Drama of Creation&quot;. This drama consisted of picture slides and moving pictures synchronized with phonograph records of talks and music. The early sound-on-disc processes such as Vitaphone were soon superseded by sound-on-film methods like Fox Movietone, DeForest Phonofilm, and RCA Photophone. The trend convinced the largely reluctant industrialists that &quot;talking pictures&quot;, or &quot;talkies&quot;, were the future. A lot of attempts were made before the success of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, that can be seen in the List of film sound systems. And in 1926, Warner Bros. Debuts the film &quot;Don Juan&quot; with synchronized sound effects and music.

The change was remarkably swift. By the end of 1929, Hollywood was almost all-talkie, with several competing sound systems (soon to be standardized). Total changeover was slightly slower in the rest of the world, principally for economic reasons. Cultural reasons were also a factor in countries like China and Japan, where silents co-existed successfully with sound well into the 1930s, indeed producing what would be some of the most revered classics in those countries, like Wu Yonggang&#x27;s &quot;The Goddess&quot; (China, 1934) and Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s &quot;I Was Born, But...&quot; (Japan, 1932). But even in Japan, a figure such as the benshi, the live narrator who was a major part of Japanese silent cinema, found his acting career was ending.

Sound further tightened the grip of major studios in numerous countries: the vast expense of the transition overwhelmed smaller competitors, while the novelty of sound lured vastly larger audiences for those producers that remained. In the case of the U.S., some historians credit sound with saving the Hollywood studio system in the face of the Great Depression (Parkinson, 1995). Thus began what is now often called &quot;The Golden Age of Hollywood&quot;, which refers roughly to the period beginning with the introduction of sound until the late 1940s. The American cinema reached its peak of efficiently manufactured glamour and global appeal during this period. The top actors of the era are now thought of as the classic film stars, such as Clark Gable, Katharine Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, Greta Garbo, and the greatest box office draw of the 1930s, child performer Shirley Temple.

===Creative impact of sound===

Creatively, however, the rapid transition was a difficult one, and in some ways, film briefly reverted to the conditions of its earliest days. The late &#x27;20s were full of static, stagey talkies as artists in front of and behind the camera struggled with the stringent limitations of the early sound equipment and their own uncertainty as to how to use the new medium. Many stage performers, directors and writers were introduced to cinema as producers sought personnel experienced in dialogue-based storytelling. Many major silent filmmakers and actors were unable to adjust and found their careers severely curtailed or even ended.

This awkward period was fairly short-lived. 1929 was a watershed year: William Wellman with &quot;Chinatown Nights&quot; and &quot;The Man I Love&quot;, Rouben Mamoulian with &quot;Applause&quot;, Alfred Hitchcock with &quot;Blackmail&quot; (Britain&#x27;s first sound feature), were among the directors to bring greater fluidity to talkies and experiment with the expressive use of sound (Eyman, 1997). In this, they both benefited from, and pushed further, technical advances in microphones and cameras, and capabilities for editing and post-synchronizing sound (rather than recording all sound directly at the time of filming).
Sound films emphasized black history, and benefited different genres to a greater extent than silents did. Most obviously, the musical film was born; the first classic-style Hollywood musical was &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; (1929), and the form would find its first major creator in choreographer/director Busby Berkeley (&quot;42nd Street&quot;, 1933, &quot;Dames&quot;, 1934). In France, avant-garde director René Clair made surreal use of song and dance in comedies like &quot;Under the Roofs of Paris&quot; (1930) and &quot;Le Million&quot; (1931). Universal Pictures began releasing gothic horror films like &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (both 1931). In 1933, RKO Pictures released Merian C. Cooper&#x27;s classic &quot;giant monster&quot; film &quot;King Kong&quot;. The trend thrived best in India, where the influence of the country&#x27;s traditional song-and-dance drama made the musical the basic form of most sound films (Cook, 1990); virtually unnoticed by the Western world for decades, this Indian popular cinema would nevertheless become the world&#x27;s most prolific. (&quot;See also Bollywood.&quot;)

At this time, American gangster films like &quot;Little Caesar&quot; and Wellman&#x27;s &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; (both 1931) became popular. Dialogue now took precedence over slapstick in Hollywood comedies: the fast-paced, witty banter of &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1931) or &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934), the sexual double entendres of Mae West (&quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot;, 1933), or the often subversively anarchic nonsense talk of the Marx Brothers (&quot;Duck Soup&quot;, 1933). Walt Disney, who had previously been in the short cartoon business, stepped into feature films with the first English-speaking animated feature &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, released by RKO Pictures in 1937. 1939, a major year for American cinema, brought such films as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Gone with The Wind&quot;.

===Color in cinema===

Circa 80 percent of the films of the 1890s to the 1920s had colours. Many made use of monochromatic film tinting dye baths, some had the frames painted in multiple transparent colours by hand, and since 1905 there was a mechanized stencil-process (Pathécolor).

Kinemacolor, the first commercially successful cinematographic colour process, produced films in two colours (red and cyan) from 1908 to 1914.

Technicolor&#x27;s natural three-strip colour process was very successfully introduced in 1932 with Walt Disney&#x27;s animated Academy Award-winning short &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot;, directed by Burt Gillett. Technicolor was initially used mainly for musicals like &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), in costume films such as &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, and in animation. Not long after television became prevalent in the early 1950s, colour became more or less standard for theatrical movies.

==1940s==
===World War II and its aftermath===

The desire for wartime propaganda against the opposition created a renaissance in the film industry in Britain, with realistic war dramas like &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941), &quot;Went the Day Well?&quot; (1942), &quot;The Way Ahead&quot; (1944) and Noël Coward and David Lean&#x27;s celebrated naval film &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; in 1942, which won a special Academy Award. These existed alongside more flamboyant films like Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943), &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot; (1944) and &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946), as well as Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1944 film &quot;Henry V&quot;, based on the Shakespearean history &quot;Henry V&quot;. The success of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; allowed Disney to make more animated features like &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940), &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941) and &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942).

The onset of US involvement in World War II also brought a proliferation of films as both patriotism and propaganda. American propaganda films included &quot;Desperate Journey&quot; (1942), &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1942), &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; (1943) and &quot;Objective, Burma!&quot; (1945). Notable American films from the war years include the anti-Nazi &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; (1943), scripted by Dashiell Hammett; &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943), Hitchcock&#x27;s direction of a script by Thornton Wilder; the George M. Cohan biographical film, &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942), starring James Cagney, and the immensely popular &quot;Casablanca&quot;, with Humphrey Bogart. Bogart would star in 36 films between 1934 and 1942 including John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), one of the first films now considered a classic film noir. In 1941, RKO Pictures released &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; made by Orson Welles. It is often considered the greatest film of all time. It would set the stage for the modern motion picture, as it revolutionized film story telling.

The strictures of wartime also brought an interest in more fantastical subjects. These included Britain&#x27;s Gainsborough melodramas (including &quot;The Man in Grey&quot; and &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;), and films like &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, &quot;I Married a Witch&quot; and &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;. Val Lewton also produced a series of atmospheric and influential small-budget horror films, some of the more famous examples being &quot;Cat People&quot;, &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; and &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot;. The decade probably also saw the so-called &quot;women&#x27;s pictures&quot;, such as &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;, &quot;Random Harvest&quot; and &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; at the peak of their popularity.

1946 saw RKO Radio releasing &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; directed by Italian-born filmmaker Frank Capra. Soldiers returning from the war would provide the inspiration for films like &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, and many of those in the film industry had served in some capacity during the war. Samuel Fuller&#x27;s experiences in World War II would influence his largely autobiographical films of later decades such as &quot;The Big Red One&quot;. The Actors Studio was founded in October 1947 by Elia Kazan, Robert Lewis, and Cheryl Crawford, and the same year Oskar Fischinger filmed &quot;Motion Painting No. 1&quot;.
In 1943, &quot;Ossessione&quot; was screened in Italy, marking the beginning of Italian neorealism. Major films of this type during the 1940s included &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot;, &quot;Rome, Open City&quot;, and &quot;La Terra Trema&quot;. In 1952 &quot;Umberto D&quot; was released, usually considered the last film of this type.

In the late 1940s, in Britain, Ealing Studios embarked on their series of celebrated comedies, including &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot;, &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot;, &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; and &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot;, and Carol Reed directed his influential thrillers &quot;Odd Man Out&quot;, &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot; and &quot;The Third Man&quot;. David Lean was also rapidly becoming a force in world cinema with &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; and his Dickens adaptations &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, and Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger would experience the best of their creative partnership with films like &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; and &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;.

==1950s==

The House Un-American Activities Committee investigated Hollywood in the early 1950s. Protested by the Hollywood Ten before the committee, the hearings resulted in the blacklisting of many actors, writers and directors, including Chayefsky, Charlie Chaplin, and Dalton Trumbo, and many of these fled to Europe, especially the United Kingdom.

The Cold War era zeitgeist translated into a type of near-paranoia manifested in themes such as invading armies of evil aliens (&quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;, &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;) and communist fifth columnists (&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;).

During the immediate post-war years the cinematic industry was also threatened by television, and the increasing popularity of the medium meant that some film theatres would bankrupt and close. The demise of the &quot;studio system&quot; spurred the self-commentary of films like &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952).

In 1950, the Lettrists avante-gardists caused riots at the Cannes Film Festival, when Isidore Isou&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Slime and Eternity&quot; was screened. After their criticism of Charlie Chaplin and split with the movement, the Ultra-Lettrists continued to cause disruptions when they showed their new hypergraphical techniques.
The most notorious film is Guy Debord&#x27;s &quot;Howls for Sade&quot; of 1952.
Distressed by the increasing number of closed theatres, studios and companies would find new and innovative ways to bring audiences back. These included attempts to widen their appeal with new screen formats. Cinemascope, which would remain a 20th Century Fox distinction until 1967, was announced with 1953&#x27;s &quot;The Robe&quot;. VistaVision, Cinerama, and Todd-AO boasted a &quot;bigger is better&quot; approach to marketing films to a dwindling US audience. This resulted in the revival of epic films to take advantage of the new big screen formats. Some of the most successful examples of these Biblical and historical spectaculars include &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958), &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960) and &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961). Also during this period a number of other significant films were produced in Todd-AO, developed by Mike Todd shortly before his death, including &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955), &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956), &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1958) and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963) plus many more.

Gimmicks also proliferated to lure in audiences. The fad for 3-D film would last for only two years, 1952–1954, and helped sell &quot;House of Wax&quot; and &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;. Producer William Castle would tout films featuring &quot;Emergo&quot; &quot;Percepto&quot;, the first of a series of gimmicks that would remain popular marketing tools for Castle and others throughout the 1960s.

In 1954, Dorothy Dandridge was nominated as the best actress at the Oscar for her role in the film Carman Jones. She became the first black woman to be nominated for this award.

In the U.S., a post-WW2 tendency toward questioning the establishment and societal norms and the early activism of the civil rights movement was reflected in Hollywood films such as &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955), &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;Marty&quot; and Reginald Rose&#x27;s &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957). Disney continued making animated films, notably; &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950), &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953), &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (1955), and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959). He began, however, getting more involved in live action films, producing classics like &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954), and &quot;Old Yeller&quot; (1957). Television began competing seriously with films projected in theatres, but surprisingly it promoted more filmgoing rather than curtailing it.

&quot;Limelight&quot; is probably a unique film in at least one interesting respect. Its two leads, Charlie Chaplin and Claire Bloom, were in the industry in no less than three different centuries. In the 19th century, Chaplin made his theatrical debut at the age of eight, in 1897, in a clog dancing troupe, The Eight Lancaster Lads. In the 21st century, Bloom is still enjoying a full and productive career, having appeared in dozens of films and television series produced up to and including 2022. She received particular acclaim for her role in &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010).

===Golden age of Asian cinema===

Following the end of World War II in the 1940s, the following decade, the 1950s, marked a &#x27;golden age&#x27; for non-English world cinema, especially for Asian cinema. Many of the most critically acclaimed Asian films of all time were produced during this decade, including Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; (1953), Satyajit Ray&#x27;s &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; (1955–1959) and &quot;Jalsaghar&quot; (1958), Kenji Mizoguchi&#x27;s &quot;Ugetsu&quot; (1954) and &quot;Sansho the Bailiff&quot; (1954), Raj Kapoor&#x27;s &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951), Mikio Naruse&#x27;s &quot;Floating Clouds&quot; (1955), Guru Dutt&#x27;s &quot;Pyaasa&quot; (1957) and &quot;Kaagaz Ke Phool&quot; (1959), and the Akira Kurosawa films &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950), &quot;Ikiru&quot; (1952), &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954) and &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; (1957).

During Japanese cinema&#x27;s &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; of the 1950s, successful films included &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950), &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; (1958) by Akira Kurosawa, as well as Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; (1953) and Ishirō Honda&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954). These films have had a profound influence on world cinema. In particular, Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; has been remade several times as Western films, such as &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960) and &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; (1980), and has also inspired several Bollywood films, such as &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975) and &quot;China Gate&quot; (1998). &quot;Rashomon&quot; was also remade as &quot;The Outrage&quot; (1964), and inspired films with &quot;Rashomon effect&quot; storytelling methods, such as &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995) and &quot;Hero&quot; (2002). &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; was also an inspiration behind George Lucas&#x27; &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Other famous Japanese filmmakers from this period include Kenji Mizoguchi, Mikio Naruse, Hiroshi Inagaki and Nagisa Oshima. Japanese cinema later became one of the main inspirations behind the New Hollywood movement of the 1960s to 1980s.

During Indian cinema&#x27;s &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; of the 1950s, it was producing 200 films annually, while Indian independent films gained greater recognition through international film festivals. One of the most famous was &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; (1955–1959) from critically acclaimed Bengali film director Satyajit Ray, whose films had a profound influence on world cinema, with directors such as Akira Kurosawa, Martin Scorsese, James Ivory, Abbas Kiarostami, Elia Kazan, François Truffaut, Steven Spielberg, Carlos Saura, Jean-Luc Godard, Isao Takahata, Gregory Nava, Ira Sachs, Wes Anderson and Danny Boyle being influenced by his cinematic style. According to Michael Sragow of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, the &quot;youthful coming-of-age dramas that have flooded art houses since the mid-fifties owe a tremendous debt to the Apu trilogy&quot;. Subrata Mitra&#x27;s cinematographic technique of bounce lighting also originates from &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot;. Other famous Indian filmmakers from this period include Guru Dutt, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Raj Kapoor, Bimal Roy, K. Asif and Mehboob Khan.

The cinema of South Korea also experienced a &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; in the 1950s, beginning with director Lee Kyu-hwan&#x27;s tremendously successful remake of &quot;Chunhyang-jon&quot; (1955). That year also saw the release of &quot;Yangsan Province&quot; by the director Kim Ki-young, marking the beginning of his career. Both the quality and quantity of filmmaking had increased rapidly by the end of the 1950s. South Korean films, such as Lee Byeong-il&#x27;s 1956 comedy &quot;Sijibganeun nal (The Wedding Day)&quot;, had begun winning international awards. In contrast to the beginning of the 1950s, when only 5 films were made per year, 111 films were produced in South Korea in 1959.

The 1950s was also a &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; for Philippine cinema, with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in cinematic techniques among filmmakers. The studio system produced frenetic activity in the local film industry as many films were made annually and several local talents started to earn recognition abroad. The premiere Philippine directors of the era included Gerardo de Leon, Gregorio Fernández, Eddie Romero, Lamberto Avellana, and Cirio Santiago.

==1960s==
During the 1960s, the studio system in Hollywood declined, because many films were now being made on location in other countries, or using studio facilities abroad, such as Pinewood in the UK and Cinecittà in Rome. &quot;Hollywood&quot; films were still largely aimed at family audiences, and it was often the more old-fashioned films that produced the studios&#x27; biggest successes. Productions like &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965) were among the biggest money-makers of the decade. The growth in independent producers and production companies, and the increase in the power of individual actors also contributed to the decline of traditional Hollywood studio production.

There was also an increasing awareness of foreign language cinema in America during this period. During the late 1950s and 1960s, the French New Wave directors such as François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard produced films such as &quot;Les quatre cents coups&quot;, &quot;Breathless&quot; and &quot;Jules et Jim&quot; which broke the rules of Hollywood cinema&#x27;s narrative structure. As well, audiences were becoming aware of Italian films like Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960), &quot;8½&quot; (1963) and the stark dramas of Sweden&#x27;s Ingmar Bergman.

In Britain, the &quot;Free Cinema&quot; of Lindsay Anderson, Tony Richardson and others led to a group of realistic and innovative dramas including &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; and &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;. Other British films such as &quot;Repulsion&quot;, &quot;Darling&quot;, &quot;Alfie&quot;, &quot;Blowup&quot; and &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; (all in 1965–1966) helped to reduce prohibitions of sex and nudity on screen, while the casual sex and violence of the James Bond films, beginning with &quot;Dr. No&quot; in 1962 would render the series popular worldwide.

During the 1960s, Ousmane Sembène produced several French- and Wolof-language films and became the &quot;father&quot; of African Cinema. In Latin America, the dominance of the &quot;Hollywood&quot; model was challenged by many film makers. Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino called for a politically engaged Third Cinema in contrast to Hollywood and the European auteur cinema.

In Egypt, the golden age of Egyptian cinema continued in the 1960s at the hands of many directors, and Egyptian cinema greatly appreciated women at that time, such as Soad Hosny. The Zulfikar brothers; Ezz El-Dine Zulfikar, Salah Zulfikar and Mahmoud Zulfikar were on a date with many productions, including Ezz El Dine Zulfikar&#x27;s &quot;The River of Love&quot; (1960), Mahmoud Zulfikar&#x27;s &quot;Soft Hands&quot; (1964), and &quot;Dearer Than My Life&quot; (1965) starring Salah Zulfikar and Salah Zulfikar Films production; &quot;My Wife, the Director General&quot; (1966) as well as Youssef Chahine&#x27;s &quot;Saladin&quot; (1963).

Further, the nuclear paranoia of the age, and the threat of an apocalyptic nuclear exchange (like the 1962 close-call with the USSR during the Cuban Missile Crisis) prompted a reaction within the film community as well. Films like Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;Fail Safe&quot; with Henry Fonda were produced in a Hollywood that was once known for its overt patriotism and wartime propaganda.

In documentary film the sixties saw the blossoming of Direct Cinema, an observational style of film making as well as the advent of more overtly partisan films like &quot;In the Year of the Pig&quot; about the Vietnam War by Emile de Antonio. By the late 1960s however, Hollywood filmmakers were beginning to create more innovative and ground-breaking films that reflected the social revolution taken over much of the western world such as &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968), &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969), &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969). &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; is often considered the beginning of the so-called New Hollywood.

In Japanese cinema, Academy Award-winning director Akira Kurosawa produced &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (1961), which like his previous films also had a profound influence around the world. The influence of this film is most apparent in Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; (1964) and Walter Hill&#x27;s &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; (1996). &quot;Yojimbo&quot; was also the origin of the &quot;Man with No Name&quot; trend.

==1970s==

The New Hollywood was the period following the decline of the studio system during the 1950s and 1960s and the end of the production code, (which was replaced in 1968 by the MPAA film rating system). During the 1970s, filmmakers increasingly depicted explicit sexual content and showed gunfight and battle scenes that included graphic images of bloody deaths a notable example of this is Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; (1972).

Post-classical cinema is the changing methods of storytelling of the New Hollywood producers. The new methods of drama and characterization played upon audience expectations acquired during the classical/Golden Age period: story chronology may be scrambled, storylines may feature unsettling &quot;twist endings&quot;, main characters may behave in a morally ambiguous fashion, and the lines between the antagonist and protagonist may be blurred. The beginnings of post-classical storytelling may be seen in 1940s and 1950s film noir films, in films such as &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955), and in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;. 1971 marked the release of controversial films like &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;The French Connection&quot; and &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. This sparked heated controversy over the perceived escalation of violence in cinema.

During the 1970s, a new group of American filmmakers emerged, such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Woody Allen, Terrence Malick, and Robert Altman. This coincided with the increasing popularity of the auteur theory in film literature and the media, which posited that a film director&#x27;s films express their personal vision and creative insights. The development of the auteur style of filmmaking helped to give these directors far greater control over their projects than would have been possible in earlier eras. This led to some great critical and commercial successes, like Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; films, William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, Altman&#x27;s &quot;Nashville&quot;, Allen&#x27;s &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Manhattan&quot;, Malick&#x27;s &quot;Badlands&quot; and &quot;Days of Heaven&quot;, and Polish immigrant Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Chinatown&quot;. It also, however, resulted in some failures, including Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;At Long Last Love&quot; and Michael Cimino&#x27;s hugely expensive Western epic &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, which helped to bring about the demise of its backer, United Artists.

The financial disaster of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; marked the end of the visionary &quot;auteur&quot; directors of the &quot;New Hollywood&quot;, who had unrestrained creative and financial freedom to develop films. The phenomenal success in the 1970s of Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot; originated the concept of the modern &quot;blockbuster&quot;. The enormous success of George Lucas&#x27; 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; led to the increased popularization of blockbuster filmmaking, and the film&#x27;s revolutionary use of special effects, sound editing and music has led it to become widely regarded as one of the most influential films in the medium&#x27;s history. Hollywood studios increasingly focused on producing a smaller number of very large budget films with massive marketing and promotional campaigns. This trend had already been foreshadowed by the commercial success of disaster films such as &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;.

During the mid-1970s, more pornographic theatres, euphemistically called &quot;adult cinemas&quot;, were established, and the legal production of hardcore pornographic films began. Porn films such as &quot;Deep Throat&quot; and its star Linda Lovelace became something of a popular culture phenomenon and resulted in a spate of similar sex films. The porn cinemas finally died out during the 1980s, when the popularization of the home VCR and pornography videotapes allowed audiences to watch sex films at home. In the early 1970s, English-language audiences became more aware of the new West German cinema, with Werner Herzog, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Wim Wenders among its leading exponents.

In world cinema, the 1970s saw a dramatic increase in the popularity of martial arts films, largely due to its reinvention by Bruce Lee, who departed from the artistic style of traditional Chinese martial arts films and added a much greater sense of realism to them with his Jeet Kune Do style. This began with &quot;The Big Boss&quot; (1971), which was a major success across Asia. However, he did not gain fame in the Western world until shortly after his death in 1973, when &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; was released. The film went on to become the most successful martial arts film in cinematic history, popularized the martial arts film genre across the world, and cemented Bruce Lee&#x27;s status as a cultural icon. Hong Kong action cinema, however, was in decline due to a wave of &quot;Bruceploitation&quot; films. This trend eventually came to an end in 1978 with the martial arts comedy films, &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot; and &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, directed by Yuen Woo-ping and starring Jackie Chan, laying the foundations for the rise of Hong Kong action cinema in the 1980s.

While the musical film genre had declined in Hollywood by this time, musical films were quickly gaining popularity in the cinema of India, where the term &quot;Bollywood&quot; was coined for the growing Hindi film industry in Bombay (now Mumbai) that ended up dominating South Asian cinema, overtaking the more critically acclaimed Bengali film industry in popularity. Hindi filmmakers combined the Hollywood musical formula with the conventions of ancient Indian theatre to create a new film genre called &quot;Masala&quot;, which dominated Indian cinema throughout the late 20th century. These &quot;Masala&quot; films portrayed action, comedy, drama, romance and melodrama all at once, with &quot;filmi&quot; song and dance routines thrown in. This trend began with films directed by Manmohan Desai and starring Amitabh Bachchan, who remains one of the most popular film stars in South Asia. The most popular Indian film of all time was &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975), a &quot;Masala&quot; film inspired by a real-life dacoit as well as Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; and the Spaghetti Westerns.

The end of the decade saw the first major international marketing of Australian cinema, as Peter Weir&#x27;s films &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; and &quot;The Last Wave&quot; and Fred Schepisi&#x27;s &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot; gained critical acclaim. In 1979, Australian filmmaker George Miller also garnered international attention for his violent, low-budget action film &quot;Mad Max&quot;.

==1980s==
During the 1980s, audiences begin increasingly watching films on their home VCRs. In the early part of that decade, the film studios tried legal action to ban home ownership of VCRs as a violation of copyright, which proved unsuccessful. Eventually, the sale and rental of films on home video became a significant &quot;second venue&quot; for exhibition of films, and an additional source of revenue for the film industries. Direct-to-video (niche) markets usually offered lower quality, cheap productions that were not deemed very suitable for the general audiences of television and theatrical releases.

The Lucas–Spielberg combine would dominate &quot;Hollywood&quot; cinema for much of the 1980s, and led to much imitation. Two follow-ups to &quot;Star Wars&quot;, three to &quot;Jaws&quot;, and three &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films helped to make sequels of successful films more of an expectation than ever before. Lucas also launched THX Ltd, a division of Lucasfilm in 1982, while Spielberg enjoyed one of the decade&#x27;s greatest successes in &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; the same year. 1982 also saw the release of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tron&quot; which was one of the first films from a major studio to use computer graphics extensively. American independent cinema struggled more during the decade, although Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), &quot;After Hours&quot; (1985), and &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; (1983) helped to establish him as one of the most critically acclaimed American film makers of the era. Also during 1983 &quot;Scarface&quot; was released, which was very profitable and resulted in even greater fame for its leading actor Al Pacino. Tim Burton&#x27;s 1989 version of Bob Kane&#x27;s creation, &quot;Batman&quot;, saw Jack Nicholson&#x27;s portrayal of the demented Joker, which earned him $60-$90m after including his percentage of the gross.

British cinema was given a boost during the early 1980s by the arrival of David Puttnam&#x27;s company Goldcrest Films. The films &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, &quot;Gandhi&quot;, &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; and &quot;A Room with a View&quot; appealed to a &quot;middlebrow&quot; audience which was increasingly being ignored by the major Hollywood studios. While the films of the 1970s had helped to define modern blockbuster motion pictures, the way &quot;Hollywood&quot; released its films would now change. Films, for the most part, would premiere in a wider number of theatres, although, to this day, some films still premiere using the route of the limited/roadshow release system. Against some expectations, the rise of the multiplex cinema did not allow less mainstream films to be shown, but simply allowed the major blockbusters to be given an even greater number of screenings. However, films that had been overlooked in cinemas were increasingly being given a second chance on home video.

During the 1980s, Japanese cinema experienced a revival, largely due to the success of anime films. At the beginning of the 1980s, &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; (1973) and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; (1979), both of which were unsuccessful as television series, were remade as films and became hugely successful in Japan. In particular, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; sparked the Gundam franchise of Real Robot mecha anime. The success of &quot;Macross: Do You Remember Love?&quot; also sparked a Macross franchise of mecha anime. This was also the decade when Studio Ghibli was founded. The studio produced Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s first fantasy films, &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; (1984) and &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; (1986), as well as Isao Takahata&#x27;s &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; (1988), all of which were very successful in Japan and received worldwide critical acclaim. Original video animation (OVA) films also began during this decade; the most influential of these early OVA films was Noboru Ishiguro&#x27;s cyberpunk film &quot;Megazone 23&quot; (1985). The most famous anime film of this decade was Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s cyberpunk film &quot;Akira&quot; (1988), which although initially unsuccessful at Japanese theaters, went on to become an international success.

Hong Kong action cinema, which was in a state of decline due to endless Bruceploitation films after the death of Bruce Lee, also experienced a revival in the 1980s, largely due to the reinvention of the action film genre by Jackie Chan. He had previously combined the comedy film and martial arts film genres successfully in the 1978 films &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot; and &quot;Drunken Master&quot;. The next step he took was in combining this comedy martial arts genre with a new emphasis on elaborate and highly dangerous stunts, reminiscent of the silent film era. The first film in this new style of action cinema was &quot;Project A&quot; (1983), which saw the formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team as well as the &quot;Three Brothers&quot; (Chan, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao). The film added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and slapstick humor, and became a huge success throughout the Far East. As a result, Chan continued this trend with martial arts action films containing even more elaborate and dangerous stunts, including &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; (1984), &quot;Police Story&quot; (1985), &quot;Armour of God&quot; (1986), &quot;Project A Part II&quot; (1987), &quot;Police Story 2&quot; (1988), and &quot;Dragons Forever&quot; (1988). Other new trends which began in the 1980s were the &quot;girls with guns&quot; subgenre, for which Michelle Yeoh gained fame; and especially the &quot;heroic bloodshed&quot; genre, revolving around Triads, largely pioneered by John Woo and for which Chow Yun-fat became famous. These Hong Kong action trends were later adopted by many Hollywood action films in the 1990s and 2000s.

==1990s==

The early 1990s saw the development of a commercially successful independent cinema in the United States. Although cinema was increasingly dominated by special-effects films such as &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991), &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993) and &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), the latter of which became the highest-grossing film of all time at the time up until &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009), also directed by James Cameron, independent films like Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot; (1989) and Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992) had significant commercial success both at the cinema and on home video.

Filmmakers associated with the Danish film movement Dogme 95 introduced a manifesto aimed to purify filmmaking. Its first few films gained worldwide critical acclaim, after which the movement slowly faded out.

Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Goodfellas&quot; was released in 1990. It is considered by many as one of the greatest movies to be made, particularly in the gangster genre. It is said to be the highest point of Scorsese&#x27;s career.
Major American studios began to create their own &quot;independent&quot; production companies to finance and produce non-mainstream fare. One of the most successful independents of the 1990s, Miramax Films, was bought by Disney the year before the release of Tarantino&#x27;s runaway hit &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; in 1994. The same year marked the beginning of film and video distribution online. Animated films aimed at family audiences also regained their popularity, with Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994). During 1995, the first feature-length computer-animated feature, &quot;Toy Story&quot;, was produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Disney. After the success of Toy Story, computer animation would grow to become the dominant technique for feature-length animation, which would allow competing film companies such as DreamWorks, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. to effectively compete with Disney with successful films of their own. During the late 1990s, another cinematic transition began, from physical film stock to digital cinema technology. Meanwhile, DVDs became the new standard for consumer video, replacing VHS tapes.

==2000s==

Since the late 2000s streaming media platforms like YouTube provided means for anyone with access to internet and cameras (a standard feature of smartphones) to publish videos to the world. Also competing with the increasing popularity of video games and other forms of home entertainment, the industry once again started to make theatrical releases more attractive, with new 3D technologies and epic (fantasy and superhero) films becoming a mainstay in cinemas.

The documentary film also rose as a commercial genre for perhaps the first time, with the success of films such as &quot;March of the Penguins&quot; and Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. A new genre was created with Martin Kunert and Eric Manes&#x27; &quot;Voices of Iraq&quot;, when 150 inexpensive DV cameras were distributed across Iraq, transforming ordinary people into collaborative filmmakers. The success of &quot;Gladiator&quot; led to a revival of interest in epic cinema, and &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; renewed interest in musical cinema. Home theatre systems became increasingly sophisticated, as did some of the special edition DVDs designed to be shown on them. &quot;The Lord of the Rings trilogy&quot; was released on DVD in both the theatrical version and in a special extended version intended only for home cinema audiences.

In 2001, the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series began, and by its end in 2011, it had become the highest-grossing film franchise of all time until the Marvel Cinematic Universe passed it in 2015.

Due to advances in film projection technology, feature films were now able to be released simultaneously to IMAX cinema, the first was in 2002&#x27;s Disney animation &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;; and the first live action was in 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and a re-release of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. Later in the decade, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; was the first major feature film to have been at least partially shot in IMAX technology.

There has been an increasing globalization of cinema during this decade, with foreign-language films gaining popularity in English-speaking markets. Examples of such films include &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (Mandarin), &quot;Amélie&quot; (French), &quot;Lagaan&quot; (Hindi), &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (Japanese), &quot;City of God&quot; (Brazilian Portuguese), &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (Aramaic), &quot;Apocalypto&quot; (Mayan) and &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; (multiple European languages). Italy is the most awarded country at the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, with 14 awards won, 3 Special Awards and 31 nominations.

In 2003, there was a revival in 3D film popularity the first being James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts of the Abyss&quot; which was released as the first full-length 3-D IMAX feature filmed with the Reality Camera System. This camera system used the latest HD video cameras, not film, and was built for Cameron by Emmy nominated Director of Photography Vince Pace, to his specifications. The same camera system was used to film &quot;Spy Kids 3D: Game Over&quot; (2003), &quot;Aliens of the Deep&quot; IMAX (2005), and &quot;The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D&quot; (2005).

After James Cameron&#x27;s 3D film &quot;Avatar&quot; became the highest-grossing film of all time, 3D films gained brief popularity with many other films being released in 3D, with the best critical and financial successes being in the field of feature film animation such as Universal Pictures/Illumination Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Despicable Me&quot; and DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s &quot;How To Train Your Dragon&quot;, &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot; and &quot;Megamind&quot;. &quot;Avatar&quot; is also note-worthy for pioneering highly sophisticated use of motion capture technology and influencing several other films such as &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot;.

==2010s==
In 2011, the largest film industries by number of feature films produced were those of India, the United States, China, Nigeria, and Japan. In Hollywood, superhero films greatly increased in popularity and financial success, with films based on Marvel and DC Comics released every year. The superhero genre was the most dominant in American box office receipts.

The list of top-grossing films was dominated by Disney, with 2019 having the most films in the top 50. The 2019 superhero film &quot;&quot; was the most successful movie of all-time at the box office. Other top earners included &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Jurassic World&quot;. Disney releases were frequently the top-grossing films annually in the latter half of the decade, with titles like &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, and &quot;Frozen&quot;. Disney&#x27;s success culminated in the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney.

Major film studios tried to emulate Disney&#x27;s Marvel Cinematic Universe&#x27;s success with their own franchises. Warner Bros. created franchises like DC Extended Universe. Disney produced live-action or photorealistic remakes of its classic animated films, such as &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Film series based on young adult novels became popular, shifting from fantasy to dystopian sci-fi. Notable series included &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;.

&quot;The Tale of Princess Kaguya&quot;, &quot;Summer 1993&quot;, &quot;Leave No Trace&quot; and &quot;Minding the Gap&quot; achieved 100% ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. Other acclaimed films included &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;, &quot;The Social Network&quot;, and &quot;Get Out&quot;. Films like &quot;Portrait of a Lady on Fire&quot;, &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot;, and &quot;Parasite&quot; were frequently listed in critics&#x27; polls for the best films of the 2010s. In 2010, the first woman to win the Best Director Award in Oscar history appeared. Katherine Bigelow&#x27;s &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; won six awards. In 2020, &quot;Parasite&quot; became the first non-English-language film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.

==2020s==
=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the closure of film theaters around the world in response to lockdowns. Many films stated to release in the early 2020s faced delays in development, production, and distribution, with others released on streaming services with little or no theatrical window. The era witnessed a profound transformation in how films are produced, distributed, and consumed globally. The pandemic led to a rapid acceleration in the shift towards streaming, as a primary means of film distribution. The film industry adapted and produced notable works that reflected changing dynamics of the era.

<doc id="10784" wikidata="Q242080" url="?curid=10784" title="Cinema of France">
<text>The cinema of France comprises the film industry and its film productions, whether made within the nation of France or by French film production companies abroad. It is the oldest and largest precursor of national cinemas in Europe, with primary influence also on the creation of national cinemas in Asia.

The Lumière brothers launched cinematography in 1895 with their &quot;L&#x27;Arrivée d&#x27;un train en gare de La Ciotat&quot;. By the early 1900s, French cinema led globally, with pioneers like Méliès creating cinematic techniques and the first sci-fi film, &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; (1902). Studios like Pathé and Gaumont dominated, with Alice Guy-Blaché directing hundreds of films. Post-WWI, French cinema declined as U.S. films flooded Europe, leading to import quotas. Between the wars, directors like Jean Renoir, Jean Vigo and Marcel Carné shaped French Poetic Realism. Renoir’s &quot;La Règle du Jeu&quot; (1939) and Carné’s &quot;Les Enfants du Paradis&quot; (1945) remain iconic, showcasing innovation despite war challenges.

From the 1940s to the 1970s, French cinema flourished with the advent of the New Wave, led by critics-turned-directors like Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut, producing groundbreaking films such as &quot;Breathless&quot; (1960) and &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; (1959). The movement, which inspired global filmmakers, faded by the late 1960s. Meanwhile, commercial French cinema gained popularity with comedies like &quot;La Grande Vadrouille&quot; (1966). Stars like Brigitte Bardot, Alain Delon and Catherine Deneuve rose to international fame. Directors like Bertrand Tavernier explored political and artistic themes. By the late 1970s, films like &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; (1978) achieved significant global success.

France was able to produce several major box office successes into the 1990s such as &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1990), while certain film like &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997) reached an international audience.

In 2013, France was the second largest exporter of films in the world after the United States, and a 2014 study showed that French cinema was the most appreciated by global audiences after that of the US. According to industry tracker The Numbers, the fortunes of French film exports have since declined: in 2019, France had fallen to the position of 7th largest exporter by total box office revenue with a 2% share of the global market, and in 2023, 15th by the same metric with a 0.44% share. Overall, France sits fourth on the tracker&#x27;s all-time box office chart behind the US, UK, and China.

Les frères Lumière released the first projection with the Cinematograph, in Paris on 28 December 1895, with first public showing in the Eden Theatre, La Ciotat. The French film industry in the late 19th century and early 20th century was the world&#x27;s most important. Auguste and Louis Lumière invented the cinématographe and their &quot;L&#x27;Arrivée d&#x27;un train en gare de La Ciotat&quot; in Paris in 1895 is considered by many historians as the official birth of cinematography. French films during this period catered to a growing middle class and were mostly shown in cafés and traveling fairs.

The early days of the industry, from 1896 to 1902, saw the dominance of four firms: Pathé Frères, the Gaumont Film Company, the Georges Méliès company, and the Lumières. Méliès invented many of the techniques of cinematic grammar, and among his fantastic, surreal short subjects is the first science fiction film &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; (&quot;Le Voyage dans la Lune&quot;) in 1902.

In 1902, the Lumières abandoned everything but the production of film stock, leaving Méliès as the weakest player of the remaining three. (He would retire in 1914.) From 1904 to 1911, the Pathé Frères company led the world in film production and distribution.
At Gaumont, pioneer Alice Guy-Blaché (M. Gaumont&#x27;s former secretary) was made head of production and oversaw about 400 films, from her first, &quot;La Fée aux Choux&quot;, in 1896, through 1906. She then continued her career in the United States, as did Maurice Tourneur and Léonce Perret after World War I.

In 1907, Gaumont owned and operated the biggest movie studio in the world, and along with the boom in construction of &quot;luxury cinemas&quot; like the Gaumont-Palace and the Pathé-Palace (both 1911), cinema became an economic challenger to theater by 1914.

=== After World War I ===
After World War I, the French film industry suffered because of a lack of capital, and film production decreased as it did in most other European countries. This allowed the United States film industry to enter the European cinema market, because American films could be sold more cheaply than European productions, since the studios already had recouped their costs in the home market. When film studios in Europe began to fail, many European countries began to set import barriers. France installed an import quota of 1:7, meaning for every seven foreign films imported to France, one French film was to be produced and shown in French cinemas.

During the period between World War I and World War II, Jacques Feyder and Jean Vigo became two of the founders of poetic realism in French cinema. They also dominated French impressionist cinema, along with Abel Gance, Germaine Dulac and Jean Epstein.

In 1931, Marcel Pagnol filmed the first of his great trilogy &quot;Marius&quot;, &quot;Fanny&quot;, and &quot;César&quot;. He followed this with other films including &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Wife&quot;. Other notable films of the 1930s included René Clair&#x27;s &quot;Under the Roofs of Paris&quot; (1930), Jean Vigo&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot; (1934), Jacques Feyder&#x27;s &quot;Carnival in Flanders&quot; (1935), and Julien Duvivier&#x27;s &quot;La belle equipe&quot; (1936). In 1935, renowned playwright and actor Sacha Guitry directed his first film and went on to make more than 30 films that were precursors to the New Wave era. In 1937, Jean Renoir, the son of painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, directed &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; (&quot;The Grand Illusion&quot;). In 1939, Renoir directed &quot;La Règle du Jeu&quot; (&quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;). Several critics have cited this film as one of the greatest of all-time, particularly for its innovative camerawork, cinematography and sound editing.

Marcel Carné&#x27;s (&quot;Children of Paradise&quot;) was filmed during World War II and released in 1945. The three-hour film was extremely difficult to make due to the Nazi occupation. Set in Paris in 1828, it was voted Best French Film of the Century in a poll of 600 French critics and professionals in the late 1990s.

=== Post–World War II ===

==== 1940s–1970s ====
In the magazine , founded by André Bazin and two other writers in 1951, film critics raised the level of discussion of the cinema, providing a platform for the birth of modern film theory. Several of the &quot;Cahiers&quot; critics, including Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Rivette and Éric Rohmer, went on to make films themselves, creating what was to become known as the French New Wave. Some of the first films of this new movement were Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot; (&quot;À bout de souffle&quot;, 1960), starring Jean-Paul Belmondo, Rivette&#x27;s &quot;Paris Belongs to Us&quot; (&quot;Paris nous appartient&quot;, 1958 – distributed in 1961), starring Jean-Claude Brialy and Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; (&quot;Les Quatre Cent Coups&quot;, 1959) starring Jean-Pierre Léaud. Later works are &quot;Contempt&quot; (1963) by Godard starring Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli and &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; starring Léaud and Claude Jade. Because Truffaut followed the hero of his screen debut, Antoine Doinel, for twenty years, the last post-New-Wave-film is &quot;Love on the Run&quot; in which his heroes Antoine (Léaud) and Christine (Jade) get divorced.
After World War II, the French actress Leslie Caron and the French actor Louis Jourdan enjoyed success in the United States with several musical romantic comedies, notably &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951) and &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958), based on the 1944 novella of the same name by Colette.

Many contemporaries of Godard and Truffaut followed suit, or achieved international critical acclaim with styles of their own, such as the minimalist films of Robert Bresson and Jean-Pierre Melville, the Hitchcockian-like thrillers of Henri-Georges Clouzot, and other New Wave films by Agnès Varda and Alain Resnais. The movement, while an inspiration to other national cinemas and unmistakably a direct influence on the future New Hollywood directors, slowly faded by the end of the 1960s.

During this period, French commercial film also made a name for itself. Immensely popular French comedies with Louis de Funès topped the French box office. The war comedy &quot;La Grande Vadrouille&quot; (1966), from Gérard Oury with Bourvil, de Funès and Terry-Thomas, was the most successful film in French theaters for more than 30 years. Another example was &quot;La Folie des grandeurs&quot; with Yves Montand. French cinema also was the birthplace for many subgenres of the crime film, most notably the modern caper film, starting with 1955&#x27;s &quot;Rififi&quot; by American-born director Jules Dassin and followed by a large number of serious, noirish heist dramas as well as playful caper comedies throughout the sixties, and the &quot;polar,&quot; a typical French blend of film noir and detective fiction.

In addition, French movie stars began to claim fame abroad as well as at home. Popular actors of the period included Brigitte Bardot, Alain Delon, Romy Schneider, Catherine Deneuve, Jeanne Moreau, Simone Signoret, Yves Montand, Jean-Paul Belmondo and still Jean Gabin.

Since the Sixties and the early Seventies they are completed and followed by Michel Piccoli and Philippe Noiret as character actors, Annie Girardot, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Jean-Pierre Léaud, Claude Jade, Isabelle Huppert, Anny Duperey, Gérard Depardieu, Patrick Dewaere, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Miou-Miou, Brigitte Fossey, Stéphane Audran and Isabelle Adjani. During the Eightees they are added by a new generation including Sophie Marceau, Emmanuelle Béart, Jean-Hugues Anglade, Sabine Azema, Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil.

In 1968, the May riots shook France. François Truffaut had already organised demonstrations in February against Henri Langlois&#x27;s removal as head of the Cinémathèque française and dedicated his film &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot;, which was being made, to Langlois. The Cannes Film Festival is cancelled – on the initiative of Truffaut, Godard and Louis Malle. Jean-Luc Godard no longer works in the commercial film business for years. Political films such as Costa-Gavras&#x27; &quot;Z&quot; celebrate success. Chabrol continues his vivisection of the bourgeoisie (&quot;The Unfaithful Wife&quot;) and Truffaut explores the possibility of bourgeois marital happiness (&quot;Bed and Board&quot;).
While Godard disappears from cinema after the Nouvelle Vague except for a few essays, Truffaut and Chabrol remain the leading directors whose artistic aspects remain commercially successful. Other directors of the 1970s in this effect are Bertrand Tavernier, Claude Sautet, Eric Rohmer, Claude Lelouch, Georges Lautner, Jean-Paul Rappeneau, Michel Deville Yves Boisset, Maurice Pialat, Bertrand Blier, Coline Serreau and André Téchiné in purely entertainment films, it is Gérard Oury and Édouard Molinaro.

The 1979 film &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; ran for well over a year at the Paris Theatre, an arthouse cinema in New York City, and was a commercial success at theaters throughout the country, in both urban and rural areas. It won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and for years it remained the most successful foreign film to be released in the United States.

==== 1980s ====
Jean-Jacques Beineix&#x27;s &quot;Diva&quot; (1981) sparked the beginning of the 1980s wave of French cinema. Movies which followed in its wake included &quot;Betty Blue&quot; (&quot;37°2 le matin&quot;, 1986) by Beineix, &quot;The Big Blue&quot; (&quot;Le Grand bleu&quot;, 1988) by Luc Besson, and &quot;The Lovers on the Bridge&quot; (&quot;Les Amants du Pont-Neuf&quot;, 1991) by Léos Carax. Made with a slick commercial style and emphasizing the alienation of their main characters, these films are representative of the style known as &quot;Cinema du look&quot;.

&quot;Camille Claudel&quot;, directed by newcomer Bruno Nuytten and starring Isabelle Adjani and Gérard Depardieu, was a major commercial success in 1988, earning Adjani, who was also the film&#x27;s co-producer, a César Award for best actress. The historical drama film &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; (1986) and its sequel &quot;Manon des Sources&quot; (1986) were among the highest grossing French films in history and brought Daniel Auteuil international recognition.

According to Raphaël Bassan, in his article «&quot;The Angel&quot;: Un météore dans le ciel de l&#x27;animation,» &quot;La Revue du cinéma&quot;, n° 393, avril 1984. , Patrick Bokanowski&#x27;s &quot;The Angel&quot;, shown in 1982 at the Cannes Film Festival, can be considered the beginnings of contemporary animation. The masks erase all human personality in the characters. Patrick Bokanowski would thus have total control over the &quot;matter&quot; of the image and its optical composition. This is especially noticeable throughout the film, with images taken through distorted objectives or a plastic work on the sets and costumes, for example in the scene of the designer. Patrick Bokanowski creates his own universe and obeys his own aesthetic logic. It takes us through a series of distorted areas, obscure visions, metamorphoses and synthetic objects. Indeed, in the film, the human may be viewed as a fetish object (for example, the doll hanging by a thread), with reference to Kafkaesque and Freudian theories on automata and the fear of man faced with something as complex as him. The ascent of the stairs would be the liberation of the ideas of death, culture, and sex that makes us reach the emblematic figure of the angel.

==== 1990s ====

Jean-Paul Rappeneau&#x27;s &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; was a major box-office success in 1990, earning several César Awards, including best actor for Gérard Depardieu, as well as an Academy Award nomination for best foreign picture.

Luc Besson made &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; in 1990, a movie that inspired remakes in both United States and in Hong Kong. In 1994, he also made &quot;Léon&quot; (starring Jean Reno and a young Natalie Portman), and in 1997 &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, which became a cult favorite and launched the career of Milla Jovovich.

Jean-Pierre Jeunet made &quot;Delicatessen&quot; and &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; (&quot;La Cité des enfants perdus&quot;), both of which featured a distinctly fantastical style.

In 1992, Claude Sautet co-wrote (with Jacques Fieschi) and directed &quot;Un Coeur en Hiver&quot;, considered by many to be a masterpiece. Mathieu Kassovitz&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Hate&quot; (&quot;La Haine&quot;) received critical praise and made Vincent Cassel a star, and in 1997, Juliette Binoche won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in &quot;The English Patient&quot;.

The success of Michel Ocelot&#x27;s &quot;Kirikou and the Sorceress&quot; in 1998 rejuvenated the production of original feature-length animated films by such filmmakers as Jean-François Laguionie and Sylvain Chomet.

==== 2000s ====
In 2000, Philippe Binant realized the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris.

In 2001, after a brief stint in Hollywood, Jean-Pierre Jeunet returned to France with &quot;Amélie&quot; (&quot;Le Fabuleux Destin d&#x27;Amélie Poulain&quot;) starring Audrey Tautou. It became the highest-grossing French-language film ever released in the United States. The following year, &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; became the sixth-highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the United States and went on to gross more than $70 million worldwide.

In 2008, Marion Cotillard won the Academy Award for Best Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her portrayal of legendary French singer Édith Piaf in &quot;La Vie en Rose&quot;, the first French-language performance to be so honored. The film won two Oscars and four BAFTAs and became the third-highest-grossing French-language film in the United States since 1980. Cotillard was the first female and second person to win both an Academy Award and César Award for the same performance.

At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, &quot;Entre les murs&quot; (&quot;The Class&quot;) won the Palme d&#x27;Or, the 6th French victory at the festival. The 2000s also saw an increase in the number of individual competitive awards won by French artists at the Cannes Festival, for direction (Tony Gatlif, &quot;Exils&quot;, 2004), screenplay (Agnès Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri, &quot;Look at Me&quot;, 2004), female acting (Isabelle Huppert, &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot;, 2001; Charlotte Gainsbourg, &quot;Antichrist&quot;, 2009) and male acting (Jamel Debbouze, Samy Naceri, Roschdy Zem, Sami Bouajila and Bernard Blancan, &quot;Days of Glory&quot;, 2006).

The 2008 rural comedy &quot;Bienvenue chez les Ch&#x27;tis&quot; drew an audience of more than 20 million, the first French film to do so. Its $193 million gross in France puts it just behind &quot;Titanic&quot; as the most successful film of all time in French theaters.

In the 2000s, several French directors made international productions, often in the action genre. These include Gérard Pirès (&quot;Riders&quot;, 2002), Pitof (&quot;Catwoman&quot;, 2004), Jean-François Richet (&quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot;, 2005), Florent Emilio Siri (&quot;Hostage&quot;, 2005), Christophe Gans (&quot;Silent Hill&quot;, 2006), Mathieu Kassovitz (&quot;Babylon A.D.&quot;, 2008), Louis Leterrier (&quot;The Transporter&quot;, 2002; &quot;Transporter 2&quot;, 2005; Olivier Megaton directed &quot;Transporter 3&quot;, 2008), Alexandre Aja (&quot;Mirrors&quot;, 2008), and Pierre Morel (&quot;Taken&quot;, 2009).

Surveying the entire range of French filmmaking today, Tim Palmer calls contemporary cinema in France a kind of eco-system, in which commercial cinema co-exists with artistic radicalism, first-time directors (who make up about 40% of all France&#x27;s directors each year) mingle with veterans, and there even occasionally emerges a fascinating pop-art hybridity, in which the features of intellectual and mass cinemas are interrelated (as in filmmakers like Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, Olivier Assayas, Maïwenn, Sophie Fillières, Serge Bozon, and others).

==== 2010s ====

One of the most noticed and best reviewed films of 2010 was the drama &quot;Of Gods and Men&quot; (&quot;Des hommes et des dieux&quot;), about the assassination of seven monks in Tibhirine, Algeria. 2011 saw the release of &quot;The Artist&quot;, a silent film shot in black and white by Michel Hazanavicius that reflected on the end of Hollywood&#x27;s silent era.

French cinema continued its upward trend of earning awards at the Cannes Festival, including the prestigious Grand Prix for &quot;Of Gods and Men&quot; (2010) and the Jury Prize for Poliss (2011); the Best Director Award for Mathieu Amalric (&quot;On Tour&quot;, 2010); the Best Actress Award for Juliette Binoche (&quot;Certified Copy&quot;, 2010); and the Best Actor Award for Jean Dujardin (&quot;The Artist&quot;, 2011).

In 2011, the film &quot;The Intouchables&quot; became the most watched film in France (including the foreign films). After ten weeks nearly 17.5 million people had seen the film in France, the film was the second most-seen French movie of all time in France, and the third including foreign movies.

In 2012, with 226 million admissions (US$1,900 million) in the world for French films (582 films released in 84 countries), including 82 million admissions in France (US$700 million), 2012 was the fourth best year since 1985. With 144 million admissions outside France (US$1,200 million), 2012 was the best year since at least 1994 (since Unifrance collects data), and the French cinema reached a market share of 2.95% of worldwide admissions and of 4.86% of worldwide sales. Three films particularly contributed to this record year: &quot;Taken 2&quot;, &quot;The Intouchables&quot; and &quot;The Artist&quot;. In 2012, films shot in French ranked 4th in admissions (145 million) behind films shot in English (more than a billion admissions in the US alone), Hindi (?: no accurate data but estimated at 3 billion for the whole India/Indian languages) and Chinese (275 million in China plus a few million abroad), but above films shot in Korean (115 million admissions in South Korea plus a few millions abroad) and Japanese (102 million admissions in Japan plus a few million abroad, a record since 1973 et its 104 million admissions). French-language movies ranked 2nd in export (outside of French-speaking countries) after films in English. 2012 was also the year French animation studio Mac Guff was acquired by an American studio, Universal Pictures, through its Illumination Entertainment subsidiary. Illumination Mac Guff became the animation studio for some of the top English-language animated movies of the 2010s, including &quot;The Lorax&quot; and the &quot;Despicable Me&quot; franchise.

In 2015 French cinema sold 106 million tickets and grossed €600 million outside of the country. The highest-grossing film was &quot;Taken 3&quot; (€261.7 million) and the largest territory in admissions was China (14.7 million). In that year, France produced more films than any other European country, producing a record-breaking 300 feature-length films. France is one of the few countries where non-American productions have the biggest share; American films only represented 44.9% of total admissions in 2014. This is largely due to the commercial strength of domestic productions.

== Government support ==
In 2013, France was the second largest exporter of films in the world after the United States, and a 2014 study showed that French cinema was the most appreciated by global audiences after that of the US.

France has had a very strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the French Government. The French government has implemented various measures aimed at supporting local film production and movie theaters. Canal+ has a broadcast license requiring it to support the production of movies. Some taxes are levied on movies and TV channels for use as subsidies for movie production. 

The French national and regional governments also involve themselves in film production. For example, the award-winning documentary &quot;In the Land of the Deaf&quot; (&quot;Le Pays des sourds&quot;), created by Nicolas Philibert in 1992, was co-produced by multinational partners, reducing the financial risks inherent in the project and ensuring enhanced distribution opportunities.

==Movie theaters ==
On 2 February 2000 in Paris, Philippe Binant realized the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP Cinema technology developed by Texas Instruments. 

In 2011 Paris had the highest density of cinemas in the world, measured by the number of movie theaters per inhabitant, In most downtown Paris movie theaters, foreign or arthouse films movies are shown alongside mainstream movies. 

Paris also boasts the Cité du cinéma, a major studio north of the city, and Disney Studio, a theme park devoted to the cinema.

==Allegations of sex abuse and coverups==
In February 2024, French actress and director Judith Godrèche called for the French film industry to “face the truth” on sexual violence and physical abuse during an appearance she made during the live broadcast of the 2024 Cesar Awards ceremony. Shortly before this, Godrèche claimed that she was sexually abused by prominent French directors Benoit Jacquot and Jacques Doillon. In May 2024, the French parliament launched a Commission to investigation reports of sex abuse in the French film industry. In July 2024, in the wake of the investigation, and later rape charge, against Jacquot for separate sex abuse allegations, it was reported that several men in the French filmmaking industry were facing a flurry of sex abuse allegations. It was also alleged that the industry provided a cover for abuse.

<text>The cinema of the Soviet Union includes films produced by the constituent republics of the Soviet Union reflecting elements of their pre-Soviet culture, language and history, albeit they were all regulated by the central government in Moscow. Most prolific in their republican films, after the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, were Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, and, to a lesser degree, Lithuania, Belarus and Moldavia. At the same time, the nation&#x27;s film industry, which was fully nationalized throughout most of the country&#x27;s history, was guided by philosophies and laws propounded by the monopoly Soviet Communist Party which introduced a new view on the cinema, socialist realism, which was different from the one before or after the existence of the Soviet Union.

==Historical outline==
Upon the establishment of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) on November 7, 1917 (although the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics did not officially come into existence until December 30, 1922), what had formerly been the Russian Empire began quickly to come under the domination of a Soviet reorganization of all its institutions. From the outset, the leaders of this new state held that film would be the most ideal propaganda tool for the Soviet Union because of its widespread popularity among the established citizenry of the new land. Vladimir Lenin viewed film as the most important medium for educating the masses in the ways, means and successes of communism. As a consequence Lenin issued the &quot;Directives on the Film Business&quot; on January 17, 1922, which instructed the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Education to systemise the film business, registering and numbering all films shown in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, extracting rent from all privately owned cinemas and subject them to censorship. Joseph Stalin later also regarded cinema as of the prime importance.

However, between World War I and the Russian Revolution, the Russian film industry and the infrastructure needed to support it (e.g., electrical power) had deteriorated to the point of unworkability. The majority of cinemas had been in the corridor between Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and most were out of commission. Additionally, many of the performers, producers, directors and other artists of pre-Soviet Russia had fled the country or were moving ahead of Red Army forces as they pushed further and further south into what remained of the Russian Empire. Furthermore, the new government did not have the funds to spare for an extensive reworking of the system of filmmaking. Thus, they initially opted for project approval and censorship guidelines while leaving what remained of the industry in private hands. As this amounted mostly to cinema houses, the first Soviet films consisted of recycled films of the Russian Empire and its imports, to the extent that these were not determined to be offensive to the new Soviet ideology. Ironically, the first new film released in Soviet Russia did not exactly fit this mold: this was &quot;Father Sergius&quot;, a religious film completed during the last weeks of the Russian Empire but not yet exhibited. It appeared on Soviet screens in 1918.

Beyond this, the government was principally able to fund only short, educational films, the most famous of which were the agitki – educational films intended to agitate, or energize and enthuse, the masses to participate fully in approved Soviet activities, and deal effectively with those who remained in opposition to the new order. These short (often one small reel) films were often simple visual aids and accompaniments to live lectures and speeches, and were carried from city to city, town to town, village to village (along with the lecturers) to educate the entire countryside, even reaching areas where film had not been previously seen.

Newsreels, as documentaries, were the other major form of earliest Soviet cinema. Dziga Vertov&#x27;s newsreel series &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot;, the best known of these, lasted from 1922 to 1925 and had a propagandistic bent; Vertov used the series to promote socialist realism but also to experiment with cinema.

Still, in 1921, there was not one functioning cinema in Moscow until late in the year. Its rapid success, using old Russian and imported feature films, jumpstarted the industry significantly, especially insofar as the government did not heavily or directly regulate what was shown, and by 1923 an additional 89 cinemas had opened. Despite extremely high taxation of ticket sales and film rentals, there was an incentive for individuals to begin making feature film product again – there were places to show the films – albeit they now had to conform their subject matter to a Soviet world view. In this context, the directors and writers who were in support of the objectives of communism assumed quick dominance in the industry, as they were the ones who could most reliably and convincingly turn out films that would satisfy government censors.
New talent joined the experienced remainder, and an artistic community assembled with the goal of defining &quot;Soviet film&quot; as something distinct and better from the output of &quot;decadent capitalism&quot;. The leaders of this community viewed it essential to this goal to be free to experiment with the entire nature of film, a position which would result in several well-known creative efforts but would also result in an unforeseen counter-reaction by the increasingly solidifying administrators of the government-controlled society.

In 1924 wrote a book on the history of film he says is &quot;the first Soviet attempt at systematization of the meager available sources [on cinema] for the general reader&quot;. Along with other articles written by Lebedev and published by &quot;Pravda&quot;, &quot;Izvestia&quot; and &quot;Kino&quot;. In the book he draws attention to the funding challenges that follow nationalization of Soviet cinema. In 1925 all film organizations merged to form &quot;Sovkino&quot;. Under &quot;Sovkino&quot; the film industry was given a tax-free benefit and held a monopoly on all film-related exports and imports.

Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; was released to wide acclaim in 1925; the film was heavily fictionalized and also propagandistic, giving the party line about the virtues of the proletariat. The &quot;kinokomitet&quot; or &quot;Film Committee&quot; established that same year published translations of important books about film theory by Béla Balázs, Rudolf Harms and Léon Moussinac.

One of the most popular films released in the 1930s was &quot;Circus&quot;. Immediately after the end of World War II, color movies such as &quot;The Stone Flower&quot; (1946), &quot;Ballad of Siberia&quot; (1947), and &quot;Cossacks of the Kuban&quot; (1949) were released. Other notable films from the 1940s include &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; and &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s Soviet cinema produced &quot;Ballad of a Soldier&quot;, which won the 1961 BAFTA Award for Best Film, and &quot;The Cranes Are Flying&quot;.

&quot;The Height&quot; is considered to be one of the best films of the 1950s (it also became the foundation of the bard movement).

In the 1980s there was a diversification of subject matter. Touchy issues could now be discussed openly. The results were films like &quot;Repentance&quot;, which dealt with repression in Georgia, and the allegorical science fiction movie &quot;Kin-dza-dza!&quot;.

==Censorship==
After the death of Stalin, Soviet filmmakers were given a freer hand to film what they believed audiences wanted to see in their film&#x27;s characters and stories. The industry remained a part of the government and any material that was found politically offensive or undesirable, was either removed, edited, reshot, or shelved. The definition of &quot;socialist realism&quot; was liberalized to allow development of more human characters, but communism still had to remain uncriticized in its fundamentals. Additionally, the degree of relative artistic liberality was changed from administration to administration.

Examples created by censorship include:

*Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; Part II was completed in 1946 but was not released until 1958; 5 years after Stalin&#x27;s death.
*Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; was censored before the German invasion of the Soviet Union due to its depiction of a strong Russian leader defying an invading army of German Teutonic Knights. After the invasion, the film was released for propaganda purposes to considerable critical acclaim.
==Revolution and Civil War==

On August 27, 1919, Vladimir Lenin nationalized the film industry and created post-imperial Soviet films &quot;when all control over film production and exhibition was ceded to the People’s Commissariat of Education.&quot; The work of the nationalized motion-picture studios was administered by the All-Russian Photography and Motion Picture Department, which was reorganized in 1923 into Goskino, which in 1926 became Sovkino. The world&#x27;s first state-filmmaking school, the First State School of Cinematography, was established in Moscow in 1919.

During the Russian Civil War, agitation trains and ships visited soldiers, workers, and peasants. Lectures, reports, and political meetings were accompanied by newsreels about events at the various fronts.

==1920s==
In the 1920s, the documentary film group headed by Dziga Vertov blazed the trail from the conventional newsreel to the &quot;image centered publicistic film&quot;, which became the basis of the Soviet film documentary. Typical of the 1920s were the topical news serial &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot; and the film &quot;Forward, Soviet!&quot; by Vertov, whose experiments and achievements in documentary films influenced the development of Russian and world cinematography. Other important films of the 1920s were Esfir Shub&#x27;s historical-revolutionary films such as &quot;The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty&quot; which used montage editing techniques to repurpose old Imperial documentaries into a revolutionary theme. In 1924, filmmakers Sergei Eisenstein and Lev Kuleshov created the first association of Soviet filmmakers, the Association of Revolutionary Cinematography (ARK), to &quot;meet the ideological and artistic needs of the proletariat&quot;. Although state controlled, &quot;the organization was characterized by a pluralism of political and artistic views until the late 1920s&quot;. One of the most iconic developments in film during this period that is still used in films today was editing and montage to create meaning. This style of film making came to be known as the Kuleshov effect and was employed to conserve film stock due to shortages during that period. The film &quot;Hydropeat&quot; by Yuri Zhelyabuzhsky marked the beginning of popular science films. Feature-length agitation films in 1918–21 were important in the development of the film industry. Innovation in Russian filmmaking was expressed particularly in the work of Eisenstein. &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; was noteworthy for its innovative montage and metaphorical quality of its film language. It won world acclaim. Eisenstein developed concepts of the revolutionary epic in the film &quot;&quot;. Also noteworthy was Vsevolod Pudovkin&#x27;s adaptation of Maxim Gorky&#x27;s &quot;Mother&quot; to the screen in 1926. Pudovkin developed themes of revolutionary history in the film &quot;The End of St. Petersburg&quot; (1927). Other noteworthy silent films were films dealing with contemporary life such as Boris Barnet&#x27;s &quot;The House on Trubnaya&quot;. The films of Yakov Protazanov were devoted to the revolutionary struggle and the shaping of a new way of life, such as &quot;Don Diego and Pelagia&quot; (1928). Ukrainian director Alexander Dovzhenko was noteworthy for the historical-revolutionary epic &quot;Zvenigora&quot;, &quot;Arsenal&quot; and the poetic film &quot;Earth&quot;.

==1930s==
In the early 1930s, Russian filmmakers applied socialist realism to their work. Among the most outstanding films was &quot;Chapaev&quot;, a film about Russian revolutionaries and society during the Revolution and Civil War. Revolutionary history was developed in films such as &quot;Golden Mountains&quot; by Sergei Yutkevich, &quot;Outskirts&quot; by Boris Barnet, and the Maxim trilogy by Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg: &quot;The Youth of Maxim&quot;, &quot;The Return of Maxim&quot;, and &quot;The Vyborg Side&quot;. Also notable were biographical films about Vladimir Lenin such as Mikhail Romm&#x27;s &quot;Lenin in October&quot; and &quot;Lenin in 1918&quot;. The life of Russian society and everyday people were depicted in films such as &quot;Seven Brave Men&quot; and &quot;Komsomolsk&quot; by Sergei Gerasimov. The comedies of Grigori Aleksandrov such as &quot;Circus&quot;, &quot;Volga-Volga&quot;, and &quot;Tanya&quot; as well as &quot;The Rich Bride&quot; by Ivan Pyryev and &quot;By the Bluest of Seas&quot; by Boris Barnet focus on the psychology of the common person, enthusiasm for work and intolerance for remnants of the past. Many films focused on national heroes, including &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; by Sergei Eisenstein, &quot;Minin and Pozharsky&quot; by Vsevolod Pudovkin, and &quot;Bogdan Khmelnitsky&quot; by Igor Savchenko. There were adaptations of literary classics, particularly Mark Donskoy&#x27;s trilogy of films about Maxim Gorky: &quot;The Childhood of Maxim Gorky&quot;, &quot;My Apprenticeship&quot;, and &quot;My Universities&quot;.

During the late 1920s and early 1930s the Stalin wing of the Communist Party consolidated its authority and set about transforming the Soviet Union on both the economic and cultural fronts. The economy moved from the market-based New Economic Policy (NEP) to a system of central planning. The new leadership declared a &quot;cultural revolution&quot; in which the party would exercise control over cultural affairs, including artistic expression. Cinema existed at the intersection of art and economics; so it was destined to be thoroughly reorganized in this episode of economic and cultural transformation.

To implement central planning in cinema, the new entity Soyuzkino was created in 1930. All the hitherto autonomous studios and distribution networks that had grown up under NEP&#x27;s market would now be coordinated in their activities by this planning agency. Soyuzkino&#x27;s authority also extended to the studios of the national republics such as VUFKU, which had enjoyed more independence during the 1920s. Soyuzkino consisted of an extended bureaucracy of economic planners and policy specialists who were charged to formulate annual production plans for the studios and then to monitor the distribution and exhibition of finished films.

With central planning came more centralized authority over creative decision making. Script development became a long, torturous process under this bureaucratic system, with various committees reviewing drafts and calling for cuts or revisions. In the 1930s censorship became more exacting with each passing year. Feature film projects would drag out for months or years and might be terminated at any point.

Alexander Dovzhenko drew from Ukrainian folk culture in such films as &quot;Earth&quot; (1930)
along the way because of the capricious decision of one or another censoring committee.
This redundant oversight slowed down production and inhibited creativity. Although central planning was supposed to increase the film industry&#x27;s productivity, production levels declined steadily through the 1930s. The industry was releasing over one-hundred features annually at the end of the NEP period, but that figure fell to seventy by 1932 and to forty-five by 1934. It never again reached triple digits during the remainder of the Stalin era. Veteran directors experienced precipitous career declines under this system of control; whereas Eisenstein was able to make four features between 1924 and 1929, he completed only one film, &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; (1938) during the entire decade of the 1930s. His planned adaptation of the Ivan Turgenev story &quot;Bezhin Meadow&quot; (1935–37) was halted during production in 1937 and officially banned, one of many promising film projects that fell victim to an exacting censorship system.

Meanwhile, the USSR cut off its film contacts with the West. It stopped importing films after 1931 out of concern that foreign films exposed audiences to capitalist ideology. The industry also freed itself from dependency on foreign technologies. During its industrialization effort of the early 1930s, the USSR finally built an array of factories to supply the film industry with the nation&#x27;s own technical resources.

To secure independence from the West, industry leaders mandated that the USSR develop its own sound technologies, rather than taking licenses on Western sound systems. Two Soviet scientists, Alexander Shorin in Leningrad (present-day St. Petersburg) and Pavel Tager in Moscow, conducted research through the late 1920s on complementary sound systems, which were ready for use by 1930. The implementation process, including the cost of refitting movie theaters, proved daunting, and the USSR did not complete the transition to sound until 1935. Nevertheless, several directors made innovative use of sound once the technology became available. In &quot;Enthusiasm: The Symphony of Donbass&quot; (1930), his documentary on coal mining and heavy industry, Dziga Vertov based his soundtrack on an elegantly orchestrated array of industrial noises. In &quot;The Deserter&quot; (1933) Pudovkin experimented with a form of &quot;sound counterpoint&quot; by exploiting tensions and ironic dissonances between sound elements and the image track. And in &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, Eisenstein collaborated with the composer Sergei Prokofiev on an &quot;operatic&quot; film style that elegantly coordinated the musical score and the image track.

As Soviet cinema made the transition to sound and central planning in the early 1930s, it was also put under a mandate to adopt a uniform film style, commonly identified as &quot;socialist realism&quot;. In 1932 the party leadership ordered the literary community to abandon the avant-garde practices of the 1920s and to embrace socialist realism, a literary style that, in practice, was actually close to 19th-century realism. The other arts, including cinema, were subsequently instructed to develop the aesthetic equivalent. For cinema, this meant adopting a film style that would be legible to a broad audience, thus avoiding a possible split between the avant-garde and mainstream cinema that was evident in the late 1920s. The director of Soyuzkino and, later, GUKF, Boris Shumyatsky (1886–1938), served as chief executive of the Soviet film industry from 1931 to 1938, and was a harsh critic of the montage aesthetic. He championed a &quot;cinema for the millions&quot;, which would use clear, linear narration. Although American movies were no longer being imported in the 1930s, the Hollywood model of continuity editing was readily available, and it had a successful track record with Soviet movie audiences. Soviet socialist realism was built on this style, which assured tidy storytelling. Various other strictures were then added to the doctrine: positive heroes to act as role models for viewers; lessons in good citizenship for spectators to embrace; and support for reigning policy decisions of the Communist Party.

Such aesthetic policies, enforced by the rigorous censorship apparatus of the USSR, resulted in a number of formulaic films. Apparently, they did succeed in sustaining a true &quot;cinema of the masses&quot;. The 1930s witnessed some stellar examples of popular cinema. The single most successful film of the decade, in terms of both official praise and genuine affection from the mass audience, was &quot;Chapaev&quot; (1934), directed by the Vasilyev brothers. Based on the life of a martyred Red Army commander, the film was touted as a model of socialist realism, in that Chapayev and his followers battled heroically for the revolutionary cause. The film also humanized the title character, giving him personal foibles, an ironic sense of humour, and a rough peasant charm. These qualities endeared him to the viewing public: spectators reported seeing the film multiple times during its first run in 1934, and &quot;Chapaev&quot; was periodically re-released for subsequent generations of audiences.

A genre that emerged in the 1930s to consistent popular acclaim was the musical comedy, and a master of that form was Grigori Aleksandrov (1903–1984). He effected a creative partnership with his wife, the brilliant comic actress and chanteuse Lyubov Orlova (1902–1975), in a series of crowd-pleasing musicals. Their pastoral comedy &quot;Volga-Volga&quot; (1938) was surpassed only by &quot;Chapaev&quot; in terms of box-office success. The fantasy element of their films, with lively musical numbers reviving the montage aesthetic, sometimes stretched the boundaries of socialist realism, but the genre could also allude to contemporary affairs. In Aleksandrov&#x27;s 1940 musical &quot;Tanya&quot;, Orlova plays a humble servant girl who rises through the ranks of the Soviet industrial leadership after developing clever labour-saving work methods. Audiences could enjoy the film&#x27;s comic turn on the &quot;Cinderella&quot; story while also learning about the value of efficiency in the workplace.

==1940s==
Immediately after the end of the Second World War, color movies such as &quot;The Stone Flower&quot; (1946), &quot;Ballad of Siberia&quot; (1947), and &quot;Cossacks of the Kuban&quot; (1949) were released.
Other notable films from the 1940s include the black and white films, &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; and &quot;Encounter at the Elbe&quot;.

The Soviet film industry suffered during the period after World War II. On top of dealing with the severe physical and monetary losses of the war, Stalin&#x27;s regime tightened social control and censorship to manage the effects recent exposure to the West had on the people. The postwar period was marked by an end of almost all autonomy in the Soviet Union. The &quot;Catalogue of Soviet Films&quot; recorded remarkably low numbers of films being produced from 1945 to 1953, with as few as nine films produced in 1951 and a maximum of twenty-three produced in 1952. These numbers do not, however, include many of the works which are not generally considered to be &quot;film&quot; in an elitist sense, such as filmed versions of theatrical works and operas, feature-length event documentaries and travelogues, short films for children, and experimental stereoscopic films. But compared to the four hundred to five hundred films produced every year by Hollywood, the Soviet film industry was practically dead.

Even as the economy of the Soviet Union strengthened, film production continued to decrease. A resolution passed by the Council of Ministers in 1948 further crippled the film industry. The resolution criticized the work of the industry, saying that an emphasis placed on quantity over quality had ideologically weakened the films. Instead, the council insisted that every film produced must be a masterpiece for promoting communist ideas and the Soviet system. Often, Stalin had the ultimate decision on whether a newly produced film was appropriate for public viewing. In private screenings after meetings of the Politburo, the Minister of the Film Industry Ivan Bolshakov privately screened films for Stalin and top members of Soviet government. The strict limitations on content and complex, centralized process for approval drove many screenwriters away, and studios had much difficulty producing any of the quality films mandated by the 1948 resolution.

===Trophy films===
Movie theaters in the postwar period faced the problem of satisfying the growing appetites of Soviet audiences for films while dealing with the shortage of newly produced works from studios. In response, cinemas played the same films for months at a time, many of them the works of the late 1930s. Anything new drew millions of people to the box office, and many theaters screened foreign films to attract larger audiences. Most of these foreign films were &quot;trophy films&quot;, two thousand films brought into the country by the Red Army after the occupation of Germany and Eastern Europe in World War II. In the top secret minutes for the CPSU Committee Meeting on August 31, 1948, the committee permitted the Minister of the Film Industry to release fifty of these films in the Soviet Union. Of these fifty, Bolshakov was only allowed to release twenty-four for screening to the general public, mainly films made in Germany, Austria, Italy, and France. The other twenty-six films, consisting almost entirely of American films, were only allowed to be shown in private screenings. The minutes also include a separate list of permitted German musical films, which were mainly German and Italian film adaptations of famous operas. Most of the trophy films were released in 1948–49, but somewhat strangely, compiled lists of the released films include ones not previously mentioned in the official minutes of the Central Committee.

The public release of these trophy films seems contradictory in the context of the 1940s Soviet Union. The Soviet government allowed the exhibition of foreign films which contained far more subversive ideas than any a Soviet director would have ever attempted putting in a film at a time when Soviet artists found themselves unemployed because of censorship laws. Historians hypothesize many possible reasons why the Soviet government showed such seemingly inexplicable leniency toward the foreign films. The government may have granted cinemas the right to show the films so they could stay in business after the domestic film industry had declined. A second hypothesis speculates that the government saw the films as an easy source of money to help rebuild the nation after the war. The minutes of the CPSU Central Committee meeting seem to support the latter idea with instructions that the films are to bring in a net income of at least 750 million roubles to the State coffers over the course of a year from public and private screenings, and 250 million roubles of this were supposed to come from rentals to the trade union camera network.

In addition to releasing the films, the committee also charged Bolshakov and the Agitation and Propaganda Department of the CPSU Central Committee &quot;with making the necessary editorial corrections to the films and with providing an introductory text and carefully edited subtitles for each film.&quot; In general, the captured Nazi films were considered apolitical enough to be shown to the general populace. Still the Propaganda and Agitation Section of the Central Committee ran into trouble with the censoring of two films slated for release. The censors found it impossible to remove the &quot;Zionist&quot; ideas from &quot;Jud Suss&quot;, an anti-Semitic, Nazi propaganda film. The censors also had trouble with a film adaptation of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; because of the representation of the poor as a detriment to society.

There is very little direct evidence of how Soviet audiences received the trophy films. Soviet magazines or newspapers never reviewed the films, there were no audience surveys, and no records exist of how many people viewed the films. To judge the reception and popularity of these foreign films, historians have mainly relied on anecdotal evidence. The German musical comedy &quot;The Woman of My Dreams&quot; received mixed reviews according to this evidence. &quot;Kultura i zhizn&quot; published a supposed survey compiled of readers&#x27; letters to the editor in March 1947 which criticize the film for being idealess, low brow, and even harmful. Bulat Okudzhava wrote a contradicting viewpoint in &quot;&quot; in 1986, saying that everyone in the city of Tbilisi was crazy about the film. According to him, everywhere he went people were talking about the film and whistling the songs. Of the two accounts, film historians generally consider Okudzhava&#x27;s more reliable than the one presented by &quot;Kultura i zhizn&quot;. Films such as &quot;His Butler&#x27;s Sister&quot;, &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;, &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; and &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot;, although not technically trophies as they had been purchased legally during the wartime alliance with America, were highly popular with Soviet audiences. In &quot;Vechernyaya Moskva&quot; (October 4, 1946), M. Chistiakov reprimanded theaters and the Soviet film industry for the fact that over a six-month timespan, sixty of the films shown had been tasteless Western films rather than Soviet ones. Even in criticism of the films and the crusading efforts of the anti-cosmopolitan campaign against the trophy films, it is clear to see they had quite an impact on Soviet society.

==1950s==
With the start of the Cold War, writers, still considered the primary auteurs, were all the more reluctant to take up script writing, and the early 1950s saw only a handful of feature films completed during any year. The death of Stalin was a relief to some people, and all the more so was the official trashing of his public image as a benign and competent leader by Nikita Khrushchev two years later. This latter event gave filmmakers the margin of comfort they needed to move away from the narrow stories of socialist realism, expand its boundaries, and begin work on a wider range of entertaining and artistic Soviet films.

Notable films include:
*&quot;The Cranes Are Flying&quot;, directed at Mosfilm by the Georgian-born director Mikhail Kalatozov in 1957. It won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival.
*&quot;Ballad of a Soldier&quot;, directed at Mosfilm by Grigory Chukhray in 1959. It won 1960 Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Prize as well as 1961 BAFTA Award for Best Film from any Source along with many other awards. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (1961).

==1960s–70s==
The 1960s and 1970s saw the creation of many films, many of which molded Soviet and post-Soviet culture. They include:
* &quot;Five Days, Five Nights&quot; (1960), the first of the joint Soviet-German films
*&quot;Walking the Streets of Moscow&quot; (1963)
*&quot;Operation Y and Shurik&#x27;s Other Adventures&quot; (1965) and its sequel, &quot;Kidnapping, Caucasian Style&quot; (1966)
*&quot;War and Peace&quot; (1966–67) Sergei Bondarchuk&#x27;s adaption of Tolstoy&#x27;s novel, with a budget of 8.5 million roubles, a running time of seven hours, and using thousands of extras. It was the first Russian film to receive an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.
*&quot;Andrei Rublev&quot; (1966) won various international awards, such as FIPRESCI.
*&quot;The Diamond Arm&quot; (1968) has contributed a lot of humorous quotes.
*&quot;The Color of Pomegranates&quot; (1969) had a limited release inside the Soviet Union and wasn&#x27;t seen abroad until years later, but has received critical acclaim since.
*&quot;White Sun of the Desert&quot; (1970), a classic &quot;Eastern&quot;, with old-fashioned stereotyping of central Asians. It is ritually watched by cosmonauts before launches, and has contributed many quotes to the Russian language such as &#x27;The East is a delicate matter&#x27;. Its theme tune became a huge hit.
*&quot;Gentlemen of Fortune&quot; (1971) starring Yevgeny Leonov
*&quot;Solaris&quot; (1972)

*&quot;The Irony of Fate, or Enjoy Your Bath!&quot; (1975)
* &quot;Office Romance&quot; (1977)
* &quot;Stalker&quot; (1979)
Since films were publicly funded by Goskino, Soviet directors were not preoccupied with commercial pressures. This contributed to the creation of philosophical and poetic films. Scripts had to be approved by a Goskino committee before the director would receive funding, and the production could be greenlighted, but in most cases, this did not amount to brazen censorship. As such, the directors Andrei Tarkovsky, Sergei Parajanov and Nikita Mikhalkov became known for the &#x27;poetic&#x27; quality of their films. In keeping with Russian culture, tragi-comedies were very popular. These decades were also prominent in the production of the Eastern or Red Western.

Animation was a respected genre, with many directors experimenting with animation techniques. &quot;Tale of Tales&quot; (1979) by Yuri Norstein was twice given the title of &quot;Best Animated Film of All Eras and Nations&quot; by animation professionals from around the world, in 1984 and 2002.

In the year of the 60th anniversary of the Soviet cinema (1979), on April 25, a decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR established a commemorative &quot;&quot;. It was then celebrated in the USSR each year on August 27, the day on which Vladimir Lenin signed a decree to nationalise the country&#x27;s cinematic and photographic industries.

==1980s==
The policies of perestroika and glasnost saw a loosening of the censorship of earlier eras. A genre known as &quot;&quot; (roughly &quot;black stuff&quot;), including films such as &quot;Little Vera&quot;, portrayed the harsher side of Soviet life. Notable films of this period include:
*&quot;Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears&quot; (1980) won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1981.
*&quot;The Pokrovsky Gate&quot; (1982), a made-for-television comedy starring Oleg Menshikov
*&quot;Repentance&quot; (1984), a Georgian film about a fictional dictator which was banned until 1987
*&quot;Come and See&quot; (1985), a widely acclaimed World War II drama
*&quot;Kin-dza-dza!&quot; (1986), allegorical science fiction
*&quot;The Cold Summer of 1953&quot; (1987), about criminals being released from the gulags after Stalin&#x27;s death
*&quot;Little Vera&quot; (1988), notable as one of the first Soviet films with sexually explicit scenes

<text>The cinema of Italy (, ) comprises the films made within Italy or by Italian directors. Since its beginning, Italian cinema has influenced film movements worldwide. Italy is one of the birthplaces of art cinema and the stylistic aspect of film has been one of the most important factors in the history of Italian film. As of 2018, Italian films have won 14 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film (the most of any country) as well as 12 Palmes d&#x27;Or (the second-most of any country), one Academy Award for Best Picture and many Golden Lions and Golden Bears.

The history of Italian cinema began a few months after the Lumière brothers began motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian director is considered to be Vittorio Calcina, a collaborator of the Lumière Brothers, who filmed Pope Leo XIII in 1896. The first films date back to 1896 and were made in the main cities of the Italian peninsula. These brief experiments immediately met the curiosity of the popular class, encouraging operators to produce new films until they laid the foundations for the birth of a true film industry. In the early years of the 20th century, silent cinema developed, bringing numerous Italian stars to the forefront until the end of World War I. In the early 1900s, artistic and epic films such as &quot;Otello&quot; (1906), &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1908), &quot;L&#x27;Inferno&quot; (1911), &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1913), and &quot;Cabiria&quot; (1914), were made as adaptations of books or stage plays. Italian filmmakers were using complex set designs, lavish costumes, and record budgets, to produce pioneering films.

The oldest European avant-garde cinema movement, Italian futurism, took place in the late 1910s. After a period of decline in the 1920s, the Italian film industry was revitalized in the 1930s with the arrival of sound film. A popular Italian genre during this period, the Telefoni Bianchi, consisted of comedies with glamorous backgrounds. Calligrafismo was instead in sharp contrast to Telefoni Bianchi-American style comedies and is rather artistic, highly formalistic, expressive in complexity and deals mainly with contemporary literary material. While Italy&#x27;s Fascist government provided financial support for the nation&#x27;s film industry, notably the construction of the Cinecittà studios (the largest film studio in Europe), it also engaged in censorship, and thus many Italian films produced in the late 1930s were propaganda films. A new era took place at the end of World War II with the birth of the influential Italian neorealist movement, reaching a vast consensus of audiences and critics throughout the post-war period, and which launched the directorial careers of Luchino Visconti, Roberto Rossellini, and Vittorio De Sica. Neorealism declined in the late 1950s in favour of lighter films, such as those of the Commedia all&#x27;italiana genre and important directors like Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni. Actresses such as Sophia Loren, Giulietta Masina and Gina Lollobrigida achieved international stardom during this period.

From the mid-1950s to the end of the 1970s, Commedia all&#x27;italiana and many other genres arose due to auteur cinema, and Italian cinema reached a position of great prestige both nationally and abroad. The Spaghetti Western achieved popularity in the mid-1960s, peaking with Sergio Leone&#x27;s Dollars Trilogy, which featured enigmatic scores by composer Ennio Morricone, which have become popular culture icons of the Western genre. Erotic Italian thrillers, or giallo, produced by directors such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento in the 1970s, influenced the horror genre worldwide. Since the 1980s, due to multiple factors, Italian production has gone through a crisis that has not prevented the production of quality films in the 1990s and into the new millennium, thanks to a revival of Italian cinema, awarded and appreciated all over the world. During the 1980s and 1990s, directors such as Ermanno Olmi, Bernardo Bertolucci, Giuseppe Tornatore, Gabriele Salvatores and Roberto Benigni brought critical acclaim back to Italian cinema, while the most popular directors of the 2000s and 2010s were Matteo Garrone, Paolo Sorrentino, Marco Bellocchio, Nanni Moretti and Marco Tullio Giordana.

The country is also famed for its prestigious Venice Film Festival, the oldest film festival in the world, held annually since 1932 and awarding the Golden Lion; In 2008 the Venice Days (&quot;Giornate degli Autori&quot;), a section held in parallel to the Venice Film Festival, has produced in collaboration with Cinecittà studios and the Ministry of Cultural Heritage a list of a 100 films that have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978: the &quot;100 Italian films to be saved&quot;. 

The David di Donatello Awards are one of the most prestigious awards at national level. Presented by the Accademia del Cinema Italiano in the Cinecittà studios, during the awards ceremony, the winners are given a miniature reproduction of the famous statue. The finalist candidates for the award, as per tradition, are first received at the Quirinal Palace by the President of Italy. The event is the Italian equivalent of the American Academy Awards.

==History==
===1890s===
The history of Italian cinema began a few months after the French Lumière brothers, who made the first public screening of a film on 28 December 1895, an event considered the birth of cinema, began motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian director is considered to be Vittorio Calcina, a collaborator of the Lumière Brothers, who filmed Pope Leo XIII on 26 February 1896 in the short film &quot;Sua Santità papa Leone XIII&quot; (&quot;His Holiness Pope Leo XIII&quot;). He then became the official photographer of the House of Savoy, the Italian ruling dynasty from 1861 to 1946. In this role he filmed the first Italian film, &quot;Sua Maestà il Re Umberto e Sua Maestà la Regina Margherita a passeggio per il parco a Monza&quot; (&quot;His Majesty the King Umberto and Her Majesty the Queen Margherita strolling through the Monza Park&quot;), believed to have been lost until it was rediscovered by the Cineteca Nazionale in 1979.

The Lumière brothers commenced public screenings in Italy in 1896 starting in March, in Rome and Milan; in April in Naples, Salerno and Bari; in June in Livorno; in August in Bergamo, Bologna and Ravenna; in October in Ancona; and in December in Turin, Pescara and Reggio Calabria. Not long before, in 1895, Filoteo Alberini patented his &quot;kinetograph&quot;, a shooting and projecting device not unlike that of the Lumières brothers.
Italian Lumière trainees produced short films documenting everyday life and comic strips in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Before long, other pioneers made their way. Italo Pacchioni, Arturo Ambrosio, Giovanni Vitrotti and Roberto Omegna were also active. The success of the short films was immediate. The cinema fascinated with its ability to show distant geographic realities with unprecedented precision and, vice versa, to immortalize everyday moments. Sporting events, local events, intense road traffic, the arrival of a train, visits by famous people, but also natural disasters and calamities are filmed.

Titles of the time include, &quot;Arrivo del treno alla Stazione di Milano&quot; (&quot;Arrival of the train at Milan station&quot;) (1896), &quot;La battaglia di neve&quot; (&quot;The snow battle&quot;) (1896), &quot;La gabbia dei matti&quot; (&quot;The madmen&#x27;s cage&quot;) (1896), &quot;Ballo in famiglia&quot; (&quot;Family dance&quot;) (1896), &quot;Il finto storpio al Castello Sforzesco&quot; (&quot;The fake cripple at the Castello Sforzesco&quot;) (1896) and &quot;La Fiera di Porta Genova&quot; (&quot;The fair of Porta Genova&quot;) (1898), all shot by Italo Pacchioni, who was also the inventor of a camera and projector, inspired by the cinematograph of Lumière brothers, kept at the Cineteca Italiana in Milan.

If the interest of the masses were enthusiastic, the technological novelty would likely be snubbed, at least at the beginning, by intellectuals and the press. Despite initial doubt, in just two years, cinema climbs the hierarchy of society, intriguing the wealthier classes. On 28 January 1897, prince Victor Emmanuel and princess Elena of Montenegro attended a screening organized by Vittorio Calcina, in a room of the Pitti Palace in Florence. Interested in experimenting with the new medium, they were filmed in &quot;S.A.R. il Principe di Napoli e la Principessa Elena visitano il battistero di S. Giovanni a Firenze &quot; (&quot;Their real heights the Prince of Naples and Princess Elena visit the baptistery of Saint John in Florence&quot;) and on the day of their wedding in &quot;Dimostrazione popolare alle LL. AA. i Principi sposi (al Pantheon – Roma)&quot; (&quot;Popular demonstration at the their heights the princes spouses (at the Pantheon – Rome)&quot;).

===1900s===
In the early years of the 20th century, the phenomenon of itinerant cinemas developed throughout Italy, providing literacy of the visual medium. This innovative form of spectacle ran out, in a short time, a number of optical attractions such as magic lanterns, cinematographers, stereoscopes, panoramas and dioramas that had fueled the European imagination and favoured the circulation of a common market for images. The nascent Italian cinema, therefore, is still linked to the traditional shows of the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; or to those typical of circus folklore. Public screenings take place in the streets, in cafes or in variety theatres in the presence of a swindler who has the task of promoting and enriching the story.

Between 1903 and 1909 the itinerant cinema Italian film was quieting, until then considered as a freak phenomenon, took on consistency assuming the characteristics of an authentic industry, led by four major organizations: Titanus (originally &quot;Monopolio Lombardo&quot;), the first italian film production company and the largest and probably the most famous film house in Italy founded by Gustavo Lombardo at Naples in 1904, Cines, based in Rome; and the Turin-based companies Ambrosio Film and Itala Film. Other companies soon followed in Milan, and these early companies quickly attained a respectable production quality and were able to market their products both within Italy and abroad. Early Italian films typically consisted of adaptations of books or stage plays, such as Mario Caserini&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; (1906) and Arturo Ambrosio&#x27;s 1908 &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;, an adaptation of the homonymous novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Also popular during this period were films about historical figures, such as Caserini&#x27;s &quot;Beatrice Cenci&quot; (1909) and Ugo Falena&#x27;s &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; (1910).
In 1905, Cines inaugurated the genre of the historical film, which in this decade gave a great fortune to many Italian filmmakers. One of the first of these films was &quot;La presa di Roma&quot; (1905), lasting 10 minutes, and made by Filoteo Alberini. The operator employs for the first time actors of theatrical origin, exploiting the historical argument in a popular and pedagogical key. The film, assimilating Manzoni&#x27;s lesson of making historical fiction plausible, reconstructs the Capture of Rome on 20 September 1870.

The discovery of the spectacular potential of the cinematographic medium favoured the development of a cinema with great ambitions, capable of incorporating all the cultural and historical suggestions of the country. Education is an inexhaustible source of ideas, ideas that are easily assimilated not only by a cultured public but also by the masses. Dozens of characters from texts make their appearance on the big screen such as the Count of Monte Cristo, Giordano Bruno, Judith beheading Holofernes, Francesca da Rimini, Lorenzino de&#x27; Medici, Rigoletto, Count Ugolino and others. From an iconographic point of view, the main references are the great Renaissance and neoclassical artists, as well as symbolists and popular illustrations.

===1910s===
In the 1910s, the Italian film industry developed rapidly. In 1912, the year of the greatest expansion, 569 films were produced in Turin, 420 in Rome and 120 in Milan. Popular early Italian actors included Emilio Ghione, Alberto Collo, Bartolomeo Pagano, Amleto Novelli, Lyda Borelli, Ida Carloni Talli, Lidia Quaranta and Maria Jacobini.

&quot;Lost in the Dark&quot;, silent drama film directed by Nino Martoglio and produced in 1914, documented life in the slums of Naples, and is considered a precursor to the Italian neorealism movement of the 1940s and 1950s. The only surviving copy of this film was destroyed by Nazi German forces during the World War II. This film is based on a 1901 play of the same title by Roberto Bracco.

In the three years leading up to World War I, as production consolidates, mythological, comedy and drama films are exported all over the world. In the meantime, in the actor&#x27;s field, the phenomenon of stardom was born which for a few years will experience unstoppable success. With the end of the decade, Rome definitively established itself as the main production center; this will remain, despite the crises that will periodically shake the industry, right up to the present day.

==== Historical blockbusters (1910s) ====

The archetypes of this film genre were &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1908), by Arturo Ambrosio and Luigi Maggi and &quot;Nero&quot; (1909), by Maggi himself and Arrigo Frusta. This last film was inspired by the work of Pietro Cossa who is iconographically based on the etchings of Bartolomeo Pinelli, neoclassicism and the show &quot;Nero, or the Destruction of Rome&quot; represented by the Barnum circus. Followed by &quot;Marin Faliero, Doge of Venice&quot; (1909), by Giuseppe De Liguoro, &quot;Otello&quot; (1909) by Yambo and &quot;L&#x27;Odissea&quot; (1911), by Bertolini, Padovan and De Liguoro.

&quot;L&#x27;Inferno&quot;, produced by Milano Films in 1911, even before being an adaptation of Dante&#x27;s canticle, was a cinematic translation of Gustave Doré&#x27;s engravings that experiments with the integration of optical effects and stage action, and it was the first Italian feature film ever made. &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1913), by Eleuterio Rodolfi, used innovative special effects.

Enrico Guazzoni&#x27;s 1913 film &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; was one of the first blockbusters in the history of cinema, using thousands of extras and a lavish set design. The international success of the film marked the maturation of the genre and allows Guazzoni to make increasingly spectacular films such as &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1913) and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1914). Giovanni Pastrone&#x27;s 1914 film &quot;Cabiria&quot; was an even larger production, requiring two years and a record budget to produce, it was the first epic film ever made and it is considered the most famous Italian silent film. It was also the first film in history to be shown in the White House. After Guazzoni came Emilio Ghione, Febo Mari, Carmine Gallone, Giulio Antamoro and many others who contributed to the expansion of the genre.

After the great success of &quot;Cabiria&quot;, with the changing tastes of the public and the first signs of the industrial crisis, the genre began to show signs of crisis. Pastrone&#x27;s plan to adapt the &quot;Bible&quot; with thousands of extras remained unfulfilled. Antamoro&#x27;s &quot;Christus&quot; (1916) and Guazzoni&#x27;s &quot;The Crusaders&quot; (1918) remained notable for their iconographic complexity but offered no substantial novelties. Despite sporadic attempts to reconnect with the &quot;grandeur&quot; of the past, the trend of historical blockbusters was interrupted at the beginning of the 1920s.

==== Proto-giallo (1910s) ====
In the first and second decade of the 20th century came a prolific film production aimed at investigative and mystery content, supported by well-assorted Italian and foreign literature that favours its transposition into film. What would later take on the synthesis of the &quot;giallo&quot;, in fact, was produced and distributed at the dawn of Italian cinema. The most prolific production houses in the 1910s were Cines, Ambrosio Film, Itala Film, Aquila Films, Milano Films and many others, while titles such as &quot;Il delitto del magistrato&quot; (1907), &quot;Il cadavere misterioso&quot; (1908), &quot;Il piccolo Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1909), &quot;L&#x27;abisso&quot; (1910) and &quot;Alibi atroce&quot; (1910), breached the imagination of the first cinema users who demanded a greater offer. The popular consensus is remarkable to the point of encouraging the film industry to invest further production resources since these films are also distributed on the French and Anglo-Saxon markets. Thus directors among the most prolific in this field such as Oreste Mentasti, Luigi Maggi, Arrigo Frusta and Ubaldo Maria Del Colle, together with many others less known, direct several dozen films where classic narrative elements of the silent proto-giallo (mystery, crime, investigation investigative and final twist) constitute the structural aspects of cinematic representation.

Elvira Notari, the first female director ever in Italy and one of the premieres in the history of world cinema, directed &quot;Carmela, la sartina di Montesanto&quot; (1916). While in Palermo, Lucarelli Film produced &quot;La cassaforte n. 8&quot; (1914) and &quot;Ipnotismo&quot; (1914), the Azzurri Film &quot;La regina della notte&quot; (1915), the Lumen Film &quot;Il romanzo fantastico del Dr. Mercanton o il giustiziere invisibile&quot; (1915) and &quot;Profumo mortale&quot; (1915), all films ascribable to the proto-giallo that multiplied in the following decades, becoming preparatory to the subsequent birth of the &quot;giallo&quot;.

==== Stardom (1910s) ====

Between 1913 and 1920 there was the rise, development and decline of the phenomenon of cinematographic stardom, born with the release of &quot;Ma l&#x27;amor mio non muore&quot; (1913), by Mario Caserini. The film had great success with the public and encoded the setting and aesthetics of female stardom. Within just a few years, Eleonora Duse, Pina Menichelli, Rina De Liguoro, Leda Gys, Hesperia, Vittoria Lepanto, Mary Cleo Tarlarini and Italia Almirante Manzini established themselves.

Films such as &quot;Fior di male&quot; (1914), by Carmine Gallone, &quot;Il fuoco&quot; (1915), by Giovanni Pastrone, &quot;Rapsodia satanica&quot; (1917), by Nino Oxilia and &quot;Cenere&quot; (1917), by Febo Mari, changed the national costume, imposing canons of beauty, role models and objects of desire. These models, strongly stylized according to the cultural and artistic trends of the time, moved away from naturalism in favor of melodramatic acting, pictorial gesture and theatrical pose; all favored by the incessant use of close-up which focuses the attention on the expressiveness of the actress.

==== Comic short films (1910s) ====
The most successful comedian in Italy was André Deed, better known in Italy as &quot;Cretinetti&quot;, star of comic short film for Itala Film. Its success paved the way for Marcel Fabre (&quot;Robinet&quot;), Ernesto Vaser (&quot;Fricot&quot;) and many others. The only actor of a certain substance, however, was Ferdinand Guillaume, who became famous with the stage name of &quot;Polidor&quot;.

The historical interest of these films lay in their ability to reveal the aspirations and fears of a petty-bourgeois society torn between the desire for affirmation and the uncertainties of the present. It was significant that the protagonists of Italian comedians never place themselves in open contrast with society or embody the desire for social revenge (as happens for example with Charlie Chaplin), but rather tried to integrate into a strongly desired world.

====Futurist cinema (1910s)====

Italian futurist cinema was the oldest movement of European avant-garde cinema. Italian futurism, an artistic and social movement, impacted the Italian film industry from 1916 to 1919. It influenced Russian Futurist cinema and German Expressionist cinema. Its cultural importance was considerable and influenced all subsequent avant-gardes, as well as some authors of narrative cinema; its echo expands to the dreamlike visions of some films by Alfred Hitchcock.

Futurism emphasized dynamism, speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. Its key figures were the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past.

The 1916 Manifesto of Futuristic Cinematography was signed by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Armando Ginna, Bruno Corra, Giacomo Balla and others. To the Futurists, cinema was an ideal art form, being a fresh medium, and able to be manipulated by speed, special effects and editing. Most of the futuristic-themed films of this period have been lost, but critics cite &quot;Thaïs&quot; (1917) by Anton Giulio Bragaglia as one of the most influential, serving as the main inspiration for German Expressionist cinema in the following decade.

The Italian film industry struggled against rising foreign competition in the years following World War I. Several major studios, among them Cines and Ambrosio, formed the Unione Cinematografica Italiana to coordinate a national strategy for film production. This effort was largely unsuccessful, however, due to a wide disconnect between production and exhibition (some movies weren&#x27;t released until several years after they were produced).
===1920s===

With the end of World War I, Italian cinema went through a period of crisis due to many factors such as production disorganization, increased costs, technological backwardness, loss of foreign markets and inability to cope with international competition, in particular with that of Hollywood. The main causes included the lack of a generational change with a production still dominated by filmmakers and producers of literary training, unable to face the challenges of modernity. The first half of the 1920s marked a sharp decrease in production; from 350 films produced in 1921 to 60 in 1924.

Literature and theatre are still the preferred narrative sources. The feuilletons resist, mostly taken from classical or popular texts and directed by specialists such as Roberto Roberti and the religious blockbusters of Giulio Antamoro. On the basis of the latest generation of divas, a sentimental cinema for women spread, centred on figures on the margins of society who, instead of struggling to emancipate themselves (as happens in contemporary Hollywood cinema), go through an authentic ordeal in order to preserve their own virtue. Protest and rebellion by the female protagonists are out of the question. It is a strongly conservative cinema, tied to social rules upset by the war and in the process of dissolution throughout Europe. An exemplary case is that of &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Story&quot; (1920) by Eugenio Perego, which uses an original narrative construction to propose a 19th-century morality with melodramatic tones.

A particular genre is that of a realist setting, due to the work of the first female director of Italian cinema, Elvira Notari, who directs numerous films influenced by popular theatre and taken from famous dramas, Neapolitan songs, appendix novels or inspired by facts of chronicle. Another film with a realist setting is &quot;Lost in the Dark&quot; (1914) by director Nino Martoglio, considered by critics as a prime example of neorealist cinema.

The revival of Italian cinema took place at the end of the decade with the production of larger-scale films. During this period, a group of intellectuals close to the fortnightly &quot;cinematografo&quot; led by Alessandro Blasetti launched a program that was as simple as it was ambitious. Aware of the Italian cultural backwardness, they decided to break all ties with the previous tradition through a rediscovery of the peasant world, hitherto practically absent in Italian cinema. &quot;Sun&quot; (1929) by Alessandro Blasetti shows the evident influence of the Soviet and German avant-gardes in an attempt to renew Italian cinema in accordance with the interests of the fascist regime. &quot;Rails&quot; (1929) by Mario Camerini blends the traditional genre of comedy with kammerspiel and realist film, revealing the director&#x27;s ability to outline the characters of the middle class. While not comparable to the best results of international cinema of the period, the works of Camerini and Blasetti testify to a generational transition between Italian directors and intellectuals, and above all an emancipation from literary models and an approach to the tastes of the public.

===1930s===
The sound cinema arrived in Italy in 1930, three years after the release of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927), and immediately led to a debate on the validity of spoken cinema and its relationship with the theatre. Some directors enthusiastically face the new challenge. The advent of talkies led to stricter censorship by the Fascist government.

The first Italian talking picture was &quot;The Song of Love&quot; (1930) by Gennaro Righelli, which was a great success with the public. Alessandro Blasetti also experimented with the use of an optical track for sound in the film &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1931), shot before &quot;The Song of Love&quot; but released a few months later. Similar to Righelli&#x27;s film is &quot;What Scoundrels Men Are!&quot; (1932) by Mario Camerini, which has the merit of making Vittorio De Sica debut on the screens. Historical films such as Blasetti&#x27;s &quot;1860&quot; (1934) and Carmine Gallone&#x27;s &quot;Scipio Africanus: The Defeat of Hannibal&quot; (1937) were also popular during this period.

With the transition to sound cinema, most of the Italian silent film actors, still linked to theatrical stylization, find themselves disqualified. The era of divas, dandies and strongmen, who barely survived the 1920s, is definitely over. Even if some performers will move on to directing or producing, the arrival of sound favours the generational change and the consequent modernization of the structures.

Italian-born director Frank Capra received three Academy Awards for Best Director for the films &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934, the first Big Five winner at the Academy Awards), &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; (1936) and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1938).

In 1932, the Venice Film Festival, the world&#x27;s oldest film festival and one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; film festivals, alongside the Cannes Film Festival and the Berlin International Film Festival, was established.

====Cinecittà (1930s–present)====

In 1934, the Italian government created the General Directorate for Cinema (&quot;Direzione Generale per le Cinematografia&quot;), and appointed Luigi Freddi its director. With the approval of Benito Mussolini, this directorate called for the establishment of a town southeast of Rome devoted exclusively to cinema, dubbed the Cinecittà (&quot;Cinema City&quot;), under the slogan &quot;Il cinema è l&#x27;arma più forte&quot; (&quot;Cinema is the most powerful weapon&quot;). The studios were constructed during the Fascist era as part of a plan to revive the Italian film industry, which had reached its low point in 1931.

Mussolini himself inaugurated the studios on 21 April 1937. Post-production units and sets were constructed and heavily used initially. Early films such as &quot;Scipio Africanus&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Iron Crown&quot; (1941) showcased the technological advancement of the studios. Seven thousand people were involved in the filming of the battle scene from &quot;Scipio Africanus&quot;, and live elephants were brought in as a part of the re-enactment of the Battle of Zama.

The Cinecittà provided everything necessary for filmmaking: theatres, technical services, and even a cinematography school, the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, for younger apprentices. The Cinecittà studios were Europe&#x27;s most advanced production facilities and greatly boosted the technical quality of Italian films. Many films are still shot entirely in Cinecittà. Benito Mussolini founded Cinecittà studio also for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II.

During this period, Mussolini&#x27;s son, Vittorio, created a national production company and organized the work of noted authors, directors and actors (including even some political opponents), thereby creating an interesting communication network among them, which produced several noted friendships and stimulated cultural interaction.

With an area of 400,000 square metres (99 acres), it is still the largest film studio in Europe, and is considered the hub of Italian cinema. Filmmakers such as Federico Fellini, Roberto Rossellini, Luchino Visconti, Sergio Leone, Bernardo Bertolucci, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, and Mel Gibson have worked at Cinecittà. More than 3,000 movies have been filmed there, of which 90 received an Academy Award nomination and 47 of these won it.

====Telefoni Bianchi (1930s–1940s)====

During the 1930s, light comedies known as Telefoni Bianchi (&quot;white telephones&quot;) were predominant in Italian cinema. These films, which featured lavish set designs, promoted conservative values and respect for authority, and thus typically avoided the scrutiny of government censors. Telefoni Bianchi proved to be the testing ground of numerous screenwriters destined to impose themselves in the following decades (including Cesare Zavattini and Sergio Amidei), and above all of numerous set designers such as Guido Fiorini, Gino Carlo Sensani and Antonio Valente, who, by virtue, successful graphic inventions led these productions to become a kind of &quot;summa&quot; of the petty-bourgeois aesthetics of the time.

The first film of the genre Telefoni Bianchi was &quot;The Private Secretary&quot; (1931), by Goffredo Alessandrini. Among the authors, Mario Camerini is the most representative director of the genre. After having practiced the most diverse trends in the 1930s, he happily moved into the territory of sentimental comedy with &quot;What Scoundrels Men Are!&quot; (1932), &quot;Il signor Max&quot; (1937) and &quot;Department Store&quot; (1939). In other films, he compares himself with the Hollywood-style comedy on the model of Frank Capra (&quot;Heartbeat&quot;, 1939) and the surreal one of René Clair (&quot;I&#x27;ll Give a Million&quot;, 1936). Camerini is interested in the figure of the typical and popular Italian, so much so that he anticipates some elements of the future Italian comedy. His major interpreter, Vittorio De Sica, will continue his lesson in &quot;Maddalena, Zero for Conduct&quot; (1940) and &quot;Teresa Venerdì&quot; (1941), emphasizing above all the direction of the actors and the care for the settings.

Other directors include Mario Mattoli (&quot;Schoolgirl Diary&quot;, 1941), Jean de Limur (&quot;Apparition&quot;, 1944) and Max Neufeld (&quot;The House of Shame&quot;, 1938; &quot;A Thousand Lire a Month&quot;, 1939). The realist comedies of Mario Bonnard (&quot;Before the Postman&quot;, 1942; &quot;The Peddler and the Lady&quot;, 1943) are partially different in character, which partially deviate from the imprint of Telefoni Bianchi.

====Fascist propaganda (1930s–1940s)====
In the fascist propaganda cinema, at the beginning, the representations of the squads and the first fascist actions were rare. &quot;The Old Guard&quot; (1934), by Alessandro Blasetti evokes the supposed vitalistic spontaneity of squads with populist tones, but is not appreciated by official critics. &quot;Black Shirt&quot; (1933), by Giovacchino Forzano, made for the 10th anniversary of the March on Rome, celebrated the regime&#x27;s policies (the reclamation of the Pontine marshes and the construction of Littoria) alternating narrative sequences with documentary passages.

With political consolidation, the government authority required the film industry to strengthen the regime&#x27;s identification with the country&#x27;s history and culture. Hence the intention to reread Italian history in an authoritarian perspective, teleologically reducing every past event to a harbinger of the &quot;fascist revolution&quot;, in continuity with the historiographical work of Gioacchino Volpe. After the first attempts in this direction, aimed above all at underlining the alleged link between the Risorgimento and Fascism (&quot;Villafranca&quot; by Forzano, 1933; &quot;1860&quot; by Blasetti, 1933), the trend reached its peak just before the war. &quot;Cavalry&quot; (1936), by Goffredo Alessandrini, evokes the nobility of the Savoy fighters by presenting their deeds as anticipations of squads. &quot;Condottieri&quot; (1937) by Luis Trenker, tells the story of Giovanni delle Bande Nere, explicitly establishing a parallel with Benito Mussolini, while &quot;Scipio Africanus: The Defeat of Hannibal&quot; (1937) by Carmine Gallone (one of the greatest financial efforts of the time), it celebrates the Roman Empire and indirectly the Fascist Empire.

The invasion of Ethiopia gives Italian directors the opportunity to extend the horizons of the settings. &quot;The Great Appeal&quot; (1936) by Mario Camerini, exalts imperialism by describing the &quot;new land&quot; as an opportunity for work and redemption, contrasting the heroism of young soldiers with bourgeois fearlessness. The anti-pacifist controversy that accompanies colonial enterprises is also evident in &quot;Lo squadrone bianco&quot; (1936) by Augusto Genina, which combines propaganda rhetoric with notable battle sequences shot in the Italian Tripolitania desert. Most of the films celebrating the empire are predominantly documentaries, aimed at disguising the war as a struggle of civilization against barbarism. The Spanish Civil War is described in the documentaries &quot;Los novios de la muerte&quot; (1936) by Romolo Marcellini and &quot;Arriba España, España una, grande, libre!&quot; (1939) by Giorgio Ferroni, and is the backdrop for another dozen films, among which the most spectacular is &quot;The Siege of the Alcazar&quot; (1940) by Augusto Genina.
Films such as &quot;Pietro Micca&quot; (1938) by Aldo Vergano, &quot;Ettore Fieramosca&quot; (1938), made in the same year by Alessandro Blasetti, and &quot;Fanfulla da Lodi&quot; (1940) by Giulio Antamoro can also be counted as propaganda films (albeit indirect), in which, a pretext for the epic narration of historical events, a clear apology for dedication to the homeland (in some cases even to the point of personal sacrifice) is made in the same vein as colonial films with a contemporary setting.

With Italy&#x27;s participation in World War II, the fascist regime further strengthens its control over production and requires a more decisive commitment to propaganda. In addition to the now canonical documentaries, short films and newsreels, there is also an increase in feature films in praise of Italian war enterprises. Among the most representative we find &quot;Bengasi&quot; (1942) by Genina, &quot;Gente dell&#x27;aria&quot; (1943) by Esodo Pratelli, &quot;The Three Pilots&quot; (1942) by Mario Mattoli (based on a screenplay by Vittorio Mussolini), &quot;Il treno crociato&quot; (1943) by Carlo Campogalliani, &quot;Harlem&quot; (1943) by Carmine Gallone and &quot;Men of the Mountain&quot; (1943) by Aldo Vergano under the supervision of Blasetti. &quot;Uomini sul fondo&quot; (1941) by Francesco De Robertis is also notable due to its almost documentary approach.

The most successful film of the period is &quot;We the Living&quot; (1942) by Goffredo Alessandrini, made as a single film, but then distributed in two parts due to its excessive length. Referable to the genre of anti-communist drama, this sombre melodrama (set in the Soviet Union) is inspired by the novel of the same name by the writer Ayn Rand which exalts the most radical philosophical individualism. Precisely because of this generic criticism of authoritarianism, the diptych could be interpreted as a mild accusation against the fascist regime.

Among the directors who give their contribution to the war propaganda, there is also Roberto Rossellini, author of a trilogy composed of &quot;The White Ship&quot; (1941), &quot;A Pilot Returns&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Man with a Cross&quot; (1943). Anticipating in some ways his works of maturity, the director adopted a modest and immediate style, which does not contrast the effectiveness of the propaganda but neither does it exalt the dominant war rhetoric; it was the same anti-spectacular approach to which he remained faithful throughout his life.

===1940s===
====Neorealism (1940s–1950s)====

By the end of World War II, the Italian &quot;neorealist&quot; movement had begun to take shape. Neorealist films typically dealt with the working class (in contrast to the &quot;Telefoni Bianchi&quot;), and were shot on location. Many neorealist films, but not all, used non-professional actors. Though the term &quot;neorealism&quot; was used for the first time to describe Luchino Visconti’s 1943 film, &quot;Ossessione&quot;, there were several important precursors to the movement, most notably Camerini&#x27;s &quot;What Scoundrels Men Are!&quot; (1932), which was the first Italian film shot entirely on location, and Blasetti&#x27;s 1942 film, &quot;Four Steps in the Clouds&quot;.

&quot;Ossessione&quot; angered Fascist officials. Upon viewing the film, Vittorio Mussolini is reported to have shouted, &quot;This is not Italy!&quot; before walking out of the theatre. The film was subsequently banned in the Fascist-controlled parts of Italy. While neorealism exploded after the war and was incredibly influential at the international level, neorealist films made up only a small percentage of Italian films produced during this period, as postwar Italian moviegoers preferred escapist comedies starring actors such as Totò and Alberto Sordi.

Neorealist works such as Roberto Rossellini&#x27;s trilogy &quot;Rome, Open City&quot; (1945), &quot;Paisà&quot; (1946), and &quot;Germany, Year Zero&quot; (1948), with professional actors such as Anna Magnani and a number of non-professional actors, attempted to describe the difficult economic and moral conditions of postwar Italy and the changes in public mentality in everyday life. Visconti&#x27;s &quot;The Earth Trembles&quot; (1948) was shot on location in a Sicilian fishing village and used local non-professional actors. Giuseppe De Santis, on other hand, used actors such as Silvana Mangano and Vittorio Gassman in his 1949 film, &quot;Bitter Rice&quot;, which is set in the Po Valley during rice-harvesting season.

Poetry and cruelty of life were harmonically combined in the works that Vittorio De Sica wrote and directed together with screenwriter Cesare Zavattini: among them, &quot;Shoeshine&quot; (1946), &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; (1948) and &quot;Miracle in Milan&quot; (1951). The 1952 film &quot;Umberto D.&quot; showed a poor old man with his little dog, who must beg for alms against his dignity in the loneliness of the new society. This work is perhaps De Sica&#x27;s masterpiece and one of the most important works in Italian cinema. It was not a commercial success and since then it has been shown on Italian television only a few times. Yet it is perhaps the most violent attack, in the apparent quietness of the action, against the rules of the new economy, the new mentality, the new values, and it embodies both a conservative and a progressive view.

Although &quot;Umberto D.&quot; is considered the end of the neorealist period, later films such as Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Strada&quot; (1954) and De Sica&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;Two Women&quot; (for which Sophia Loren won the Oscar for Best Actress) are grouped with the genre. Director Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s first film, &quot;Accattone&quot; (1961), shows a strong neorealist influence. Italian neorealist cinema influenced filmmakers around the world, and helped inspire other film movements, such as the French New Wave and the Polish Film School. The Neorealist period is often simply referred to as &quot;The Golden Age&quot; of Italian cinema by critics, filmmakers, and scholars.

====Calligrafismo (1940s)====
Calligrafismo is in sharp contrast to Telefoni Bianchi-American style comedies and is rather artistic, highly formalistic, expressive in complexity and deals mainly with contemporary literary material, above all the pieces of Italian realism from authors like Corrado Alvaro, Ennio Flaiano, Emilio Cecchi, Francesco Pasinetti, Vitaliano Brancati, Mario Bonfantini and Umberto Barbaro.

The best-known exponent of this genre is Mario Soldati, a long-time writer and director destined to establish himself with films of literary ancestry and solid formal structure. His films put at the centre of the story characters endowed with a dramatic and psychological strength foreign to both white-phone cinema and propaganda films, and found in works such as &quot;Dora Nelson&quot; (1939), &quot;Piccolo mondo antico&quot; (1941), &quot;Tragic Night&quot; (1942), &quot;Malombra&quot; (1942) and &quot;In High Places&quot; (1943). Luigi Chiarini, already active as a critic, deepens the trend in his &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1942), &quot;Street of the Five Moons&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Innkeeper&quot; (1944). The internal conflicts of the characters and the scenographic richness are also recurrent in the first films by Alberto Lattuada (&quot;Giacomo the Idealist&quot;, 1943) and Renato Castellani (&quot;A Pistol Shot&quot;, 1942), dominated by a sense of moral and cultural decay that seems to anticipate the end of the war.

Another important example of a calligraphic film is the film version of &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (1941), by Mario Camerini (very faithful in the staging of Manzoni&#x27;s masterpiece), which due to the perceived income, became the most popular feature film between 1941 and 1942.

==== Animation (1940s–present)====

The pioneer of the Italian cartoon was Francesco Guido, better known as Gibba. Immediately after the end of World War II, he produced the first animated medium-length film of Italian cinema entitled &quot;L&#x27;ultimo sciuscià&quot; (1946), which took up themes typical of neorealism and in the following decade the feature films &quot;Rompicollo and I picchiatelli&quot;, in collaboration with Antonio Attanasi. In the 1970s, after many animated documentaries, Gibba himself will return to the feature film with the erotic &quot;Il nano e la strega&quot; (1973) and &quot;Il racconto della giungla&quot; (1974). Also interesting are the contributions of the painter and set designer Emanuele Luzzati who, after some valuable short films, made in 1976 one of the masterpieces of Italian animation: &quot;Il flauto magico&quot; (&quot;The Magic Flute&quot;), based on the homonymous opera by Mozart.

In 1949, the designer Nino Pagot presented &quot;The Dynamite Brothers&quot; at the Venice Film Festival, one of the first animated feature films of the time, released in theatres in conjunction with &quot;La Rosa di Bagdad&quot; (1949), made by the animator Anton Gino Domeneghini. In the early 1950s, the cartoonist Romano Scarpa created the short film &quot;La piccola fiammiferaia&quot; (1953), which remains, like the two previous films, little more than an isolated case. Apart from these examples, Italian animation in the 1950s and 1960s failed to become a major reality and remains confined to the television sector, due to the various commissions provided by the Carosello container.
But it is with Bruno Bozzetto that the Italian cartoon reaches an international dimension: his debut feature film &quot;West and Soda&quot; (1965), an irresistible caricature of the Western genre, received acclaim from both audiences and critics. A few years later his second work entitled &quot;VIP my Brother Superman&quot; was released, distributed in 1968. After many satirical short films (centred on the popular figure of &quot;Signor Rossi&quot;) he returned to the feature film with what is considered his most ambitious work, &quot;Allegro Non Troppo&quot; (1977). Inspired by the well-known Disney &quot;Fantasia&quot;, it is a mixed media film, in which animated episodes are molded to the notes of many classical music pieces. Another illustrator to underline is the artist Pino Zac who in 1971 shot (again with mixed technique) &quot;The Nonexistent Knight&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by Italo Calvino.

In the 1990s, Italian animation entered a new phase of production due to the Turin Lanterna Magica studio which in 1996, under the direction of Enzo D&#x27;Alò, created the intriguing Christmas fairy tale &quot;How the Toys Saved Christmas&quot;, based on a short story by Gianni Rodari. The film was a success and paved the way for other feature films. In fact, in 1998, &quot;Lucky and Zorba&quot; based on a novel by Luis Sepúlveda was distributed, which attracted the favour of the public, reaching a new apex in the Italian animated cinema.

The director Enzo d&#x27;Alò, who separated from the Lanterna Magica studio, produced other films in the following years such as &quot;Momo&quot; (2001) and &quot;Opopomoz&quot; (2003). The Turin studio distributed on its behalf the films &quot;Aida of the Trees&quot; (2001) and &quot;Totò Sapore e la magica storia della pizza&quot; (2003), accompanied by a good response at the box office. In 2003, the first entirely Italian animated film in computer graphics was released entitled &quot;L&#x27;apetta Giulia and Signora Vita&quot;, directed by Paolo Modugno. To underline the work &quot;La Storia di Leo&quot; (2007) by director Mario Cambi, winner, the following year, at the Giffoni Film Festival.

In 2010, the first Italian animated film in 3D technology was made, directed by Iginio Straffi, entitled &quot;Winx Club 3D: Magical Adventure&quot;, based on the homonymous series; in the meantime Enzo D&#x27;Alò returns to theatres, presenting his &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (2012). In 2012, the film &quot;Gladiators of Rome&quot;, also shot in 3D technology, received credit from the public, followed by the feature film &quot;Winx Club: The Mystery of the Abyss&quot; (2014), both again by Iginio Straffi. Finally, &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot; (2013) by Alessandro Rak, a film made in Naples by 40 authors, including only 10 designers and animators from the Mad Entertainment studio, a true absolute record for an animated film was made. &quot;Cinderella the Cat&quot; (2017), taken from the text &quot;Pentamerone&quot; by Giambattista Basile, came out of the same studio. The work won two David di Donatello&#x27;s, one of which was for special effects, becoming the first animated film to be nominated, and win, in this category.

===1950s===

Starting from the mid-1950s, Italian cinema freed itself from neorealism by tackling purely existential topics, films with different styles and points of view, often more introspective than descriptive. Thus we are witnessing a new flowering of filmmakers who contribute in a fundamental way to the development of the art.

Michelangelo Antonioni is the first to establish himself, becoming a reference author for all contemporary cinema. This charge of novelty is recognizable from the beginning as the director&#x27;s first work, &quot;Story of a Love Affair&quot; (1950), marks an indelible break with the world of neorealism and the consequent birth of a modern cinema. Antonioni investigated the world of the Italian bourgeoisie with a critical eye, left out of the post-war cinematic lens. In doing so, works of psychological research such as &quot;I Vinti&quot; (1952), &quot;The Lady Without Camelias&quot; (1953) and &quot;Le Amiche&quot; (1955), free adaptation of the short story &quot;Tra donne sole&quot; by Cesare Pavese, came to light. In 1957, he staged the unusual proletarian drama &quot;Il Grido&quot;, with which he obtained critical acclaim.

In 1955, the David di Donatello was established, with its Best Picture category being awarded for the first time only in 1970. Named after Donatello&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;, a symbolic statue of the Italian Renaissance, are film awards given out each year by the &quot;Accademia del Cinema Italiano&quot; (The Academy of Italian Cinema).

====Federico Fellini (1950s–1990s)====
Federico Fellini is recognized as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time. Fellini won the Palme d&#x27;Or for &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, and won four in the category of Best Foreign Language Film, the most for any director in the history of the academy. He received an honorary award for Lifetime Achievement at the 65th Academy Awards in Los Angeles. His other well-known films include &quot;La Strada&quot; (1954), &quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot; (1957), &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; (1967), &quot;Satyricon&quot; (1969), &quot;Roma&quot; (1972), &quot;Amarcord&quot; (1973), and &quot;Fellini&#x27;s Casanova&quot; (1976).

Personal and highly idiosyncratic visions of society, Fellini&#x27;s films are a unique combination of memory, dreams, fantasy and desire. The adjectives &quot;Fellinian&quot; and &quot;Felliniesque&quot; are &quot;synonymous with any kind of extravagant, fanciful, even baroque image in the cinema and in art in general&quot;. &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; contributed the term &quot;paparazzi&quot; to the English language, derived from Paparazzo, the photographer friend of journalist Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni).

Contemporary filmmakers such as Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Emir Kusturica, and David Lynch have cited Fellini&#x27;s influence on their work.

====Pink neorealism (1950s–1960s)====
Although &quot;Umberto D.&quot; is considered the end of the neorealist period, subsequent works turned toward lighter, sweetened and mildly optimistic atmospheres, more coherent with the improving conditions of Italy just before the economic boom; this genre became known as &quot;pink neorealism&quot;.

The precursor of pink neorealism was Renato Castellani, who helped bring realist comedy into vogue with &quot;Under the Sun of Rome&quot; (1948) and &quot;It&#x27;s Forever Springtime&quot; (1949), both shot on location and with non-professional actors, and above all with public success and criticism of &quot;Two Cents Worth of Hope&quot; (1952), which laid the foundations for pink neorealism.
Notable films of pink neorealism, which combine popular comedy and realist motifs, are &quot;Pane, amore e fantasia&quot; (1953) by Luigi Comencini and &quot;Poveri ma belli&quot; (1957) by Dino Risi, both works are in perfect harmony with the evolution of the Italian costume. The large influx at the box office from the two films remained almost unchanged in the sequels &quot;Bread, Love and Jealousy&quot; (1954), &quot;Scandal in Sorrento&quot; (1955) and &quot;Pretty But Poor&quot; (1957), also directed by Luigi Comencini and Dino Risi.

Similarly, stories of daily life told with gentle irony (without losing sight of the social fabric) can be found in the work of the Milanese Luciano Emmer, whose films &quot;Sunday in August&quot; (1950), &quot;Three Girls from Rome&quot; (1952) and &quot;High School&quot; (1954), are the best-known examples. Another film of the pink neorealism genre was &quot;Susanna Whipped Cream&quot; (1957) by Steno.

This trend allowed some actresses to become real celebrities, such as Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida, Silvana Pampanini, Lucia Bosé, Barbara Bouchet, Eleonora Rossi Drago, Silvana Mangano, Virna Lisi, Claudia Cardinale and Stefania Sandrelli. Soon pink neorealism was replaced by the Commedia all&#x27;italiana, a unique genre that, born on an ideally humouristic line, talked instead very seriously about important social themes.
====Commedia all&#x27;Italiana (1950s–1970s)====

Commedia all&#x27;italiana (&quot;Comedy in the Italian way&quot;) is an Italian film genre born in Italy in the 1950s and developed in the following 1960s and 1970s. It is widely considered to have started with Mario Monicelli&#x27;s &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot; in 1958 and derives its name from the title of Pietro Germi&#x27;s &quot;Divorce Italian Style&quot;, 1961. According to most of the critics, &quot;La Terrazza&quot; by Ettore Scola (1980) is the last work considered part of the Commedia all&#x27;italiana.

Rather than a specific genre, the term indicates a period (approximately from the late 1950s to the early 1970s) in which the Italian film industry was producing many successful comedies, with some common traits like satire of manners, farcical and grotesque overtones, a strong focus on &quot;spicy&quot; social issues of the period (like sexual matters, divorce, contraception, marriage of the clergy, the economic rise of the country and its various consequences, the traditional religious influence of the Catholic Church) and a prevailing middle-class setting, often characterized by a substantial background of sadness and social criticism that diluted the comic contents.
The genre of Commedia all&#x27;italiana differs markedly from the light and disengaged comedy from the so-called &quot;pink neorealism&quot; trend, in vogue until all of the 1950s, since, starting from the lesson of neorealism, is based on a more frank adherence in writing to reality; therefore, alongside the comic situations and plots typical of traditional comedy, always combines, with irony, a biting and sometimes bitter satire of manners, which reflects the evolution of Italian society in those years.
The success of films belonging to the &quot;Commedia all&#x27;italiana&quot; genre is due both to the presence of an entire generation of great actors, who knew how to masterfully embody the vices and virtues, and the attempts at emancipation but also the vulgarities of the Italians of the time, both to the careful work of directors, storytellers and screenwriters, who invented a real genre, with essentially new connotations, managing to find precious material for their cinematographic creations in the folds of a rapid evolution with many contradictions.

Among the actors the main representatives are Alberto Sordi, Ugo Tognazzi, Vittorio Gassman, Marcello Mastroianni and Nino Manfredi, while among the actresses is Monica Vitti. Among directors and films, in 1961 Dino Risi directed &quot;Una vita difficile&quot; (&quot;A Difficult Life&quot;), then &quot;Il Sorpasso&quot; (&quot;The Easy Life&quot;), now a cult-movie, followed by: &quot;I Mostri&quot; (&quot;The Monsters&quot;, also known as &quot;15 From Rome&quot;), &quot;In nome del popolo italiano&quot; (&quot;In the Name of the Italian People&quot;) and &quot;Profumo di donna&quot; (&quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;). Monicelli&#x27;s works include &quot;La grande guerra&quot; (&quot;The Great War&quot;), &quot;I compagni&quot; (&quot;The Organizer&quot;), &quot;L&#x27;armata Brancaleone&quot;, &quot;Vogliamo i colonnelli&quot; (&quot;We Want the Colonels&quot;), &quot;Romanzo popolare&quot; (&quot;Come Home and Meet My Wife&quot;) and the &quot;Amici miei&quot; (&quot;My Friends&quot;) series.

For the majority of critics the true and proper &quot;Commedia all&#x27;italiana&quot; is to be considered definitively waned since the beginning of the 1980s, giving way, at most, to an &quot;Commedia italiana&quot; (&quot;Italian comedy&quot;).

====Totò (1950s–1960s)====

At this time, on the more commercial side of production, the phenomenon of Totò, a Neapolitan actor who is acclaimed as the major Italian comic, exploded. His films (often with Aldo Fabrizi, Peppino De Filippo and almost always with Mario Castellani) expressed a sort of neorealistic satire, in the means of a &quot;guitto&quot; (a &quot;hammy&quot; actor) as well as with the art of the great dramatic actor he also was. Totò is one of the symbols of the cinema of Naples.

A &quot;film-machine&quot; who produced dozens of titles per year, his repertoire was frequently repeated. His personal story (a prince born in the poorest &quot;rione&quot; (section of the city) of Naples), his unique twisted face, his special mimic expressions and his gestures created an inimitable personage and made him one of the most beloved Italians of the 1960s.

Some of his best-known films are &quot;Fear and Sand&quot; by Mario Mattoli, &quot;Toto Tours Italy&quot; by Mario Mattoli, &quot;Toto the Sheik&quot; by Mario Mattoli, &quot;Cops and Robbers&quot; by Mario Monicelli, &quot;Toto and the Women&quot; by Mario Monicelli, &quot;Totò Tarzan&quot; by Mario Mattoli, &quot;Toto the Third Man&quot; by Mario Mattoli, &quot;Toto and the King of Rome&quot; by Mario Monicelli and Steno, &quot;Toto in Color&quot; by Steno (one of the first Italian colour movies, 1952, in Ferrania colour), &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot; by Mario Monicelli, &quot;Toto, Peppino, and the Hussy&quot; by Camillo Mastrocinque and &quot;The Law Is the Law&quot; by Christian-Jaque. Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s &quot;The Hawks and the Sparrows&quot; and the episode &quot;Che cosa sono le nuvole&quot; from &quot;Caprice Italian Style&quot; (the latter released after his death), showed his dramatic skills.
====Don Camillo and Peppone (1950s–1980s)====
A series of black-and-white films based on Don Camillo and Peppone characters created by the Italian writer and journalist Giovannino Guareschi were made between 1952 and 1965. These were French-Italian coproductions, and starred Fernandel as the Italian priest Don Camillo and Gino Cervi as Giuseppe &#x27;Peppone&#x27; Bottazzi, the Communist Mayor of their rural town. The titles are: &quot;The Little World of Don Camillo&quot; (1952), &quot;The Return of Don Camillo&quot; (1953), &quot;Don Camillo&#x27;s Last Round&quot; (1955), &quot;Don Camillo: Monsignor&quot; (1961), and &quot;Don Camillo in Moscow&quot; (1965).

The movies were a huge commercial success in their native countries. In 1952, &quot;Little World of Don Camillo&quot; became the highest-grossing film in both Italy and France, while &quot;The Return of Don Camillo&quot; was the second most popular film of 1953 at the Italian and French box office.

Mario Camerini began filming the film &quot;Don Camillo e i giovani d&#x27;oggi&quot;, but had to stop filming due to Fernandel&#x27;s falling ill, which resulted in his untimely death. The film was then realized in 1972 with Gastone Moschin playing the role of Don Camillo and Lionel Stander as Peppone.

A new Don Camillo film, titled &quot;The World of Don Camillo&quot;, was also remade in 1983, an Italian production with Terence Hill directing and also starring as Don Camillo. Colin Blakely performed Peppone in one of his last film roles.

====Hollywood on the Tiber (1950s–1960s)====
Hollywood on the Tiber is a phrase used to describe the period in the 1950s and 1960s when the Italian capital of Rome emerged as a major location for international filmmaking attracting many foreign productions to the Cinecittà studios, the largest film studio in Europe. By contrast to the native Italian film industry, these movies were made in English for global release. Although the primary markets for such films were American and British audiences, they enjoyed widespread popularity in other countries, including Italy.

In the late 1940s, Hollywood studios began to shift production abroad to Europe. Italy was, along with Britain, one of the major destinations for American film companies. Large-budget films shot at Cinecittà during the &quot;Hollywood on the Tiber&quot; era such as &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951), &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953), &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963) were made in English with international casts and sometimes, but not always, Italian settings or themes.

The heyday of what was dubbed &#x27;&quot;Hollywood on the Tiber&quot; was between 1950 and 1970, during which time many of the most famous names in world cinema made films in Italy. The phrase &quot;Hollywood on Tiber&quot;, a reference to the river that runs through Rome, was coined in 1950 by &quot;Time&quot; magazine during the making of &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;.


====Sword-and-sandal (a.k.a. Peplum) (1950s–1960s)====

Sword-and-sandal, also known as &quot;peplum&quot; (&quot;pepla&quot; plural), is a subgenre of largely Italian-made historical, mythological, or Biblical epics mostly set in the Greco-Roman antiquity or the Middle Ages. These films attempted to emulate the big-budget Hollywood historical epics of the time.

With the release of 1958&#x27;s &quot;Hercules&quot;, starring American bodybuilder Steve Reeves, the Italian film industry gained entree to the American film market. These films were low-budget costume/adventure dramas, and had immediate appeal with both European and American audiences. Besides the many films starring a variety of muscle men as Hercules, heroes such as Samson and Italian fictional hero Maciste were common.

Sometimes dismissed as low-quality escapist fare, the sword-and-sandal allowed newer directors such as Sergio Leone and Mario Bava a means of breaking into the film industry. Some, such as Mario Bava&#x27;s &quot;Hercules in the Haunted World&quot; (Italian: Ercole Al Centro Della Terra) are considered seminal works in their own right.

As the genre matured, budgets sometimes increased, as evidenced in 1962&#x27;s &quot;I sette gladiatori&quot; (&quot;The Seven Gladiators&quot; in 1964 US release), a wide-screen epic with impressive sets and matte-painting work. Most sword-and-sandal films were in colour, whereas previous Italian efforts had often been black and white.


====Musicarelli (1950s–1970s)====

Musicarello (pl. musicarelli) is a film subgenre which emerged in Italy and which is characterised by the presence in main roles of young singers, already famous among their peers, and their new record album. The genre began in the late 1950s, and had its peak of production in the 1960s.

The film which started the genre is considered to be &quot;I ragazzi del Juke-Box&quot; by Lucio Fulci (1959). The musicarelli were inspired by two American musicals, in particular &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; by Richard Thorpe (1957) and earlier &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; by Robert D. Webb (1956), both starring Elvis Presley.

At the heart of the musicarello is a hit song, or a song that the producers hoped would become a hit, that usually shares its title with the film itself and sometimes has lyrics depicting a part of the plot. In the films there are almost always tender and chaste love stories accompanied by the desire to have fun and dance without thoughts. Musicarelli reflect the desire and need for emancipation of young Italians, highlighting some generational frictions.

With the arrival of the 1968 student protests the genre started to decline, because the generational revolt became explicitly political and at the same time there was no longer music equally directed to the whole youth audience. For some time the duo Al Bano and Romina Power continued to enjoy success in musicarello films, but their films (like their songs) were a return to the traditional melody and to the musical films of the previous decades.

===1960s===
====Spaghetti Western (1960s–1970s)====

On the heels of the sword-and-sandal craze, a related genre, the Spaghetti Western arose and was popular both in Italy and elsewhere. These films differed from traditional westerns by being filmed in Europe on limited budgets, but featured vivid cinematography. The term was used by foreign critics because most of these westerns were produced and directed by Italians.

The most popular Spaghetti Westerns were those of Sergio Leone, credited as the inventor of the genre, whose Dollars Trilogy (1964&#x27;s &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, an unauthorized remake of the Japanese film &quot;Yojimbo&quot; by Akira Kurosawa; 1965&#x27;s &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;, an original sequel; and 1966&#x27;s &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, a World-famous prequel), featuring Clint Eastwood as a character marketed as &quot;the Man with No Name&quot; and notorious scores by Ennio Morricone, came to define the genre along with &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968).

Another popular Spaghetti Western film is Sergio Corbucci &quot;Django&quot; (1966), starring Franco Nero as the titular character, another &quot;Yojimbo&quot; plagiarism, produced to capitalize on the success of &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;. The original &quot;Django&quot; was followed by both an authorized sequel (1987&#x27;s &quot;Django Strikes Again&quot;) and an overwhelming number of unauthorized uses of the same character in other films.
====Bud Spencer and Terence Hill (1960s–1990s)====

Also considered Spaghetti Westerns is a film genre which combined traditional western ambience with a Commedia all&#x27;italiana-type comedy; films including &quot;They Call Me Trinity&quot; (1970) and &quot;Trinity Is Still My Name&quot; (1971), both by Enzo Barboni, which featured Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, the stage names of Carlo Pedersoli and Mario Girotti.

Terence Hill and Bud Spencer made numerous films together. Most of their early films were Spaghetti Westerns, beginning with &quot;God Forgives... I Don&#x27;t!&quot; (1967), the first part of a trilogy, followed by &quot;Ace High&quot; (1968) and &quot;Boot Hill&quot; (1969), but they also starred in comedies such as &quot;... All the Way, Boys!&quot; (1972) and &quot;Watch Out, We&#x27;re Mad!&quot; (1974).

The next films shot by the couple of actors, almost all comedies, were &quot;Two Missionaries&quot; (1974), &quot;Crime Busters&quot; (1977), &quot;Odds and Evens&quot; (1978), &quot;I&#x27;m for the Hippopotamus&quot; (1979), &quot;Who Finds a Friend Finds a Treasure&quot; (1981), &quot;Go for It&quot; (1983), &quot;Double Trouble&quot; (1984), &quot;Miami Supercops&quot; (1985) and &quot;Troublemakers&quot; (1994).
====Giallo (1960s–present)====

During the 1960s and 1970s, Italian filmmakers Mario Bava, Riccardo Freda, Antonio Margheriti and Dario Argento developed &quot;giallo&quot; (plural &quot;gialli&quot;, from &quot;giallo&quot;, Italian for &quot;yellow&quot;) horror films that become classics and influenced the genre in other countries. Representative films include: &quot;The Girl Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1963), &quot;Castle of Blood&quot; (1964), &quot;The Bird with the Crystal Plumage&quot; (1970), &quot;Twitch of the Death Nerve&quot; (1971), &quot;Deep Red&quot; (1975) and &quot;Suspiria&quot; (1977).

&quot;Giallo&quot; is a genre of mystery fiction and thrillers and often contains slasher, crime fiction, psychological thriller, psychological horror, sexploitation, and, less frequently, supernatural horror elements. &quot;Giallo&quot; developed in the mid-to-late 1960s, peaked in popularity during the 1970s, and subsequently declined in commercial mainstream filmmaking over the next few decades, though examples continue to be produced. It was a predecessor to, and had significant influence on, the later American slasher film genre.

&quot;Giallo&quot; usually blends the atmosphere and suspense of thriller fiction with elements of horror fiction (such as slasher violence) and eroticism (similar to the French &quot;fantastique&quot; genre), and often involves a mysterious killer whose identity is not revealed until the final act of the film. Most critics agree that the &quot;giallo&quot; represents a distinct category with unique features, but there is some disagreement on what exactly defines a &quot;giallo&quot; film.
&quot;Giallo&quot; films are generally characterized as gruesome murder-mystery thrillers that combine the suspense elements of detective fiction with scenes of shocking horror, featuring excessive bloodletting, stylish camerawork and often jarring musical arrangements. The archetypal &quot;giallo&quot; plot involves a mysterious, black-gloved psychopathic killer who stalks and butchers a series of beautiful women. While most &quot;gialli&quot; involve a human killer, some also feature a supernatural element.

The typical &quot;giallo&quot; protagonist is an outsider of some type, often a traveller, tourist, outcast, or even an alienated or disgraced private investigator, and frequently a young woman, often a young woman who is lonely or alone in a strange or foreign situation or environment (&quot;gialli&quot; rarely or less frequently feature law enforcement officers as chief protagonists).

The protagonists are generally or often unconnected to the murders before they begin and are drawn to help find the killer through their role as witnesses to one of the murders. The mystery is the identity of the killer, who is often revealed in the climax to be another key character, who conceals his or her identity with a disguise (usually some combination of hat, mask, sunglasses, gloves, and trench coat). Thus, the literary whodunit element of the &quot;giallo&quot; novels is retained, while being filtered through horror genre elements and Italy&#x27;s long-standing tradition of opera and staged grand guignol drama. The structure of &quot;giallo&quot; films is also sometimes reminiscent of the so-called &quot;weird menace&quot; pulp magazine horror mystery genre alongside Edgar Allan Poe and Agatha Christie.

====Poliziotteschi (1960s–1970s)====
Poliziotteschi (plural of poliziottesco) films constitute a subgenre of crime and action films that emerged in Italy in the late 1960s and reached the height of their popularity in the 1970s. They are also known as &quot;polizieschi all&#x27;italiana&quot;, Euro-crime, Italo-crime, spaghetti crime films&#x27;, or simply Italian crime films.

Influenced by both 1970s French crime films and gritty 1960s and 1970s American cop films and vigilante films, poliziotteschi films were made amidst an atmosphere of socio-political turmoil in Italy and increasing Italian crime rates.

The films generally featured graphic and brutal violence, organized crime, car chases, vigilantism, heists, gunfights, and corruption up to the highest levels. The protagonists were generally tough working-class loners, willing to act outside a corrupt or overly bureaucratic system. Notable international actors who acted in this genre of films include Alain Delon, Henry Silva, Fred Williamson, Charles Bronson, Tomas Milian and others.
====Franco and Ciccio (1960s–1980s)====

Franco and Ciccio were a comedy duo formed by Italian actors Franco Franchi (1928–1992) and Ciccio Ingrassia (1922–2003), particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Together, they appeared in 116 films, usually as the main characters, and occasionally as supporting characters in films featuring well-known actors such as Totò, Domenico Modugno, Vittorio Gassman, Buster Keaton and Vincent Price.

Their collaboration began in 1954 in the theatre field, and ended with Franchi&#x27;s death in 1992. The two made their cinema debut in 1960 with the film &quot;Appuntamento a Ischia&quot;. After, seeing them in this film Modugno, who wanted them with him in his film, and remained active until 1984 when they shot their last film together, &quot;Kaos&quot;, although there were some interruptions in 1973, and from 1975 to 1980.

They acted in films certainly made in a short time and with few means, such as those shot with director Marcello Ciorciolini, sometimes even making a dozen films in a year, often without a real script and where they often improvised on the set. Also are the 13 films directed by Lucio Fulci, who was the architect of the reversal of their typical roles by making Ciccio the serious one, the sidekick, and Franco the comic one.

They also worked with important directors such as Pier Paolo Pasolini and the Taviani brothers. At the time, they were considered protagonists of B movie, they were subsequently reevaluated by critics for their comedy and creative abilities, becoming the subject of study. The huge success with the public is evidenced by the box office earnings, which in the 1960s, represented 10% of the annual earnings in Italy.

==== Social and political cinema (1960s–1970s) ====
The auteur cinema of the 1960s continues its path by analyzing distinct themes and problems. A new authorial vision is emancipated from the surreal and existential veins of Fellini and Antonioni which sees cinema as an ideal means of denouncing corruption and malfeasance, both in the political system and in the industrial world. Thus was born the structure of the investigative film which, starting from the neorealist analysis of the facts, added to them a concise critical judgment, with the manifest intent of shaking the consciences of public opinion. This typology deliberately touches upon burning issues, often targeting the established power, with the intent of reconstructing a historical truth that is often hidden or denied.
The precursor of this way of understanding the director&#x27;s profession was Francesco Rosi. In 1962 he inaugurated the investigation film project retracing, through a series of long flashbacks, the life of the homonym Sicilian criminal in the film &quot;Salvatore Giuliano&quot;. The following year he directed Rod Steiger in &quot;Hands over the City&quot; (1963), in which he courageously denounced the collusion existing between the various organs of the State and the building exploitation in Naples. The film was awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.

One of Francesco Rosi&#x27;s most famous films of denunciation is &quot;The Mattei Affair&quot; (1972), a rigorous documentary into the mysterious disappearance of Enrico Mattei, manager of Eni, a large Italian state group. The film won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It became (together with the tight &quot;Illustrious Corpses&quot; (1976)) a true model for similar denunciation films produced both in Italy and abroad. Famous films of denunciation by Elio Petri are &quot;The Working Class Goes to Heaven&quot; (1971), a corrosive denunciation of life in the factory (winner of the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes) and &quot;Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion&quot; (1970). The latter (accompanied by the incisive soundtrack by Ennio Morricone) is a dry psychoanalytic thriller centred on the aberrations of power, analyzed in a pathological key. The film obtained a wide consensus, winning the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film the following year.

Arguments related to civilian cinema can be found in the work of Damiano Damiani, who with &quot;The Day of the Owl&quot; (1968) enjoyed considerable success. Other feature films include, &quot;Confessions of a Police Captain&quot; (1971), &quot;The Case Is Closed, Forget It&quot; (1971), &quot;How to Kill a Judge&quot; (1974) and &quot;I Am Afraid&quot; (1977). Also Pasquale Squitieri for the film &quot;Il prefetto di ferro&quot; (1977) and Giuliano Montaldo, who after some experiences as an actor, staged some historical and political films such as &quot;The Fifth Day of Peace&quot; (1970), &quot;Sacco &amp; Vanzetti&quot; (1971) and &quot;Giordano Bruno&quot; (1973). Also Nanni Loy for the film &quot;In Prison Awaiting Trial&quot; (1971) starring Alberto Sordi.

===1970s===
In the 1970s the work done by the director Lina Wertmüller was influential, who together with the well-established actors Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato, gave life to successful films such as &quot;The Seduction of Mimi&quot; (1972), &quot;Love and Anarchy&quot; (1973) and &quot;Swept Away&quot; (1974). Two years later, with &quot;Seven Beauties&quot; (1976), she obtained four nominations for the Academy Awards, making her the first woman ever to receive a nomination for best director.

The last protagonist of the great season of the comedy is the director Ettore Scola. Throughout the 1950s, he played the role of screenwriter, and then makes his directorial debut in 1964 with the film &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Women&quot;. In 1974, he directed his best-known film, &quot;We All Loved Each Other So Much&quot;, which traces 30 years of Italian history through the stories of three friends: the lawyer Gianni Perego (Vittorio Gassman), the porter Antonio (Nino Manfredi) and the intellectual Nicola (Stefano Satta Flores). Other films include, &quot;Down and Dirty&quot; (1976) starring Nino Manfredi, and &quot;A Special Day&quot; (1977) starring Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni.

====Commedia sexy all&#x27;italiana (1970s–1980s)====

Commedia sexy all&#x27;italiana is characterized typically by both abundant female nudity and comedy, and by the minimal weight given to social criticism that was the basic ingredient of the main commedia all&#x27;italiana genre. Stories are often set in affluent environments such as wealthy households. It is closely connected to the sexual revolution, which was extremely new and innovative for that period. For the first time, films with female nudity could be watched at the cinema. Pornography and scenes of explicit sex were still forbidden in Italian cinemas, but partial nudity was somewhat tolerated. The genre has been described as a cross between bawdy comedy and humorous erotic film with ample slapstick elements which follow more or less clichéd storylines.

During this time, commedia sexy all&#x27;italiana films, described by the film critics of the time as not artistic or &quot;trash films&quot;, were very popular in Italy. Today they are widely re-evaluated and have become real cult movies. They also allowed the producers of Italian cinema to have enough revenue to produce successful artistic films. These comedy films were of little artistic value and reached their popularity by confronting Italian social taboos, most notably in the sexual sphere. Actors such as Lando Buzzanca, Lino Banfi, Renzo Montagnani, Alvaro Vitali, Gloria Guida, Barbara Bouchet and Edwige Fenech owe much of their popularity to these films.
====Fantozzi (1970s–1990s)====
The films starring Ugo Fantozzi, a character invented by Paolo Villaggio for his television sketches and newspaper short stories, also fell within the comic satirical comedy genre. Although Villaggio&#x27;s movies tend to bridge comedy with a more elevated social satire, this character had a great impact on Italian society, to such a degree that the adjective &quot;fantozziano&quot; entered the lexicon. Ugo Fantozzi represents the archetype of the average Italian of the 1970s, middle-class with a simple lifestyle with the anxieties common to an entire class of workers, being re-evaluated by critics.

Of the many films telling of Fantozzi&#x27;s misadventures, the most notable and famous were &quot;Fantozzi&quot; (1975) and &quot;Il secondo tragico Fantozzi&quot; (1976), both directed by Luciano Salce, but many others were produced. The other films were &quot;Fantozzi contro tutti&quot; (1980) directed by Neri Parenti, &quot;Fantozzi subisce ancora&quot; (1983) by Neri Parenti, &quot;Superfantozzi&quot; (1986) by Neri Parenti, &quot;Fantozzi va in pensione&quot; (1988) by Neri Parenti, &quot;Fantozzi alla riscossa&quot; (1990) by Neri Parenti, &quot;Fantozzi in paradiso&quot; (1993) by Neri Parenti, &quot;Fantozzi - Il ritorno&quot; (1996) by Neri Parenti and &quot;Fantozzi 2000 - La clonazione&quot; (1999) by Domenico Saverni.
==== Sceneggiata (1970s–1990s)====
The sceneggiata (pl. sceneggiate) or sceneggiata napoletana is a form of musical drama typical of Naples. Beginning as a form of musical theatre after World War I, it was also adapted for cinema; sceneggiata films became especially popular in the 1970s, and contributed to the genre becoming more widely known outside Naples. The most famous actors who played dramas were Mario Merola, Mario Trevi, and Nino D&#x27;Angelo.

The sceneggiata can be roughly described as a &quot;musical soap opera&quot;, where action and dialogue are interspersed with Neapolitan songs. Plots revolve around melodramatic themes drawing from the Neapolitan culture and tradition, including passion, jealousy, betrayal, personal deceit and treachery, honour, vengeance, and life in the world of petty crime. Songs and dialogue were originally in Neapolitan dialect, although, especially in film production, Italian has sometimes been preferred, to reach a larger audience.

&quot;Sgarro alla camorra&quot; (i.e. &quot;Offence to the Camorra&quot;, 1973), written and directed by Ettore Maria Fizzarotti and starring Mario Merola at his film debut, is regarded as the first sceneggiata film and as a prototype for the genre. It was shot in Cetara, Province of Salerno. Outside Italy, sceneggiata is mostly known in areas populated by Italian immigrants. Besides Naples, the second homeland of sceneggiata is probably Little Italy in New York City.

===1980s===
The 1980s was a period of decline for Italian filmmaking. In 1985, only 80 films were produced (the least since the postwar period) and the total number of audience decreased from 525 million in 1970 to 123 million. It is a physiological process that invests, in the same period as other countries, with a great cinematographic tradition such as Japan, United Kingdom and France. The era of producers ended; Carlo Ponti and Dino De Laurentiis work abroad, Goffredo Lombardo and Franco Cristaldi were no longer key figures. The crisis affects the Italian genre cinema above all, which, by virtue of the success of commercial television, is deprived of the vast majority of its audience. As a result, cinemas began showing mainly Hollywood films, which steadily took over, while many other cinemas closed.

Among the major artistic films of this era were &quot;La città delle donne&quot;, &quot;E la nave va&quot;, &quot;Ginger and Fred&quot; by Fellini, &quot;L&#x27;albero degli zoccoli&quot; by Ermanno Olmi (winner of the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival), &quot;La notte di San Lorenzo&quot; by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Identificazione di una donna&quot;, and &quot;Bianca&quot; and &quot;La messa è finita&quot; by Nanni Moretti. Although not entirely Italian, Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;, winner of 9 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director, and &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; of Sergio Leone came out of this period also.

&quot;Non ci resta che piangere&quot;, directed by and starring both Roberto Benigni and Massimo Troisi, is a cult movie in Italy.

Carlo Verdone, actor, screenwriter and film director, is best known for his comedic roles in Italian classics, which he also wrote and directed. His career was jumpstarted by his first three successes, &quot;Un sacco bello&quot; (1980), &quot;Bianco, rosso e Verdone&quot; (1981) and &quot;Borotalco&quot; (1982). Since the 1990s, he has been introducing more serious subjects in his work, linked to the excesses of society and the individual&#x27;s hardships in confronting it; some examples are &quot;Maledetto il giorno che t&#x27;ho incontrata&quot; (1992), &quot;Il mio miglior nemico&quot; (2006) and &quot;Io, loro e Lara&quot; (2010).

Francesco Nuti began his professional career as an actor in the late 1970s, when he formed the cabaret group &quot;Giancattivi&quot; together with Alessandro Benvenuti and Athina Cenci. The group took part in the TV shows &quot;Black Out&quot; and &quot;Non Stop&quot; for RAI TV, and shot their first feature film, &quot;West of Paperino&quot; (1981), written and directed by Benvenuti. The following year Nuti abandoned the trio and began a solo career with three movies directed by Maurizio Ponzi: &quot;What a Ghostly Silence There Is Tonight&quot; (1982), &quot;The Pool Hustlers&quot; (1982) and &quot;Son contento&quot; (1983). Starting in 1985, he began to direct his movies, scoring an immediate success with the films &quot;Casablanca, Casablanca &quot; and &quot; All the Fault of Paradise&quot; (1985), &quot;Stregati&quot; (1987), &quot;Caruso Pascoski, Son of a Pole&quot; (1988), &quot;Willy Signori e vengo da lontano&quot; (1990) and &quot;Women in Skirts&quot; (1991). The 1990s were however a period of decline for the Tuscan director, with poorly successful movies such as &quot;OcchioPinocchio&quot; (1994), &quot;Mr. Fifteen Balls&quot; (1998), &quot;Io amo Andrea&quot; (2000) and &quot;Caruso, Zero for Conduct&quot; (2001).

The cinepanettoni (singular: &quot;cinepanettone&quot;) are a series of farcical comedy films, one or two of which are scheduled for release annually in Italy during the Christmas period. The films were originally produced by Aurelio De Laurentiis&#x27; Filmauro studio. These films are usually focused on the holidays of stereotypical Italians: bungling, wealthy and presumptuous members of the middle class who visit famous, glamorous or exotic places.

===1990s===

The economic crisis that emerged in the 1980s began to ease over the next decade. Nonetheless, the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons marked an all-time low in the number of films made, in the national market share (15 per cent), in the total number of viewers (under 90 million per year) and in the number of cinemas. The effect of this industrial contraction sanctions the total disappearance of Italian genre cinema in the middle of the decade, as it was no longer suitable to compete with the contemporary big Hollywood blockbusters (mainly due to the enormous budget differences available), with its directors and actors who therefore almost entirely switch to television film.

A new generation of directors has helped return Italian cinema to a healthy level since the end of the 1980s. Probably the most noted film of the period is &quot;Nuovo Cinema Paradiso&quot;, for which Giuseppe Tornatore won a 1989 Oscar (awarded in 1990) for Best Foreign Language Film. This award was followed when Gabriele Salvatores&#x27;s &quot;Mediterraneo&quot; won the same prize in 1991.

&quot;Il Postino: The Postman&quot; (1994), directed by the British Michael Radford and starring Massimo Troisi, received five nominations at the Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Troisi, and won for Best Original Score. Another exploit was in 1998 when Roberto Benigni won three Oscars for his movie &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; (&quot;La vita è bella)&quot; (Best Actor for Benigni himself, Best Foreign Film, Best Music). The film was also nominated for Best Picture.

Leonardo Pieraccioni made his directorial debut with &quot;The Graduates&quot; (1995). In 1996 he directed his breakthrough film &quot;The Cyclone&quot;, which grossed Lire75 billion at the box office.

===2000s===
With the new millennium, the Italian film industry regained stability and critical recognition. In 1995, 93 films were produced, while in 2005, 274 films were made. In 2006, the national market share reached 31 per cent. In 2001, Nanni Moretti&#x27;s film &quot;The Son&#x27;s Room&quot; (&quot;La stanza del figlio&quot;) received the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Other noteworthy recent Italian films include: &quot;Jona che visse nella balena&quot; directed by Roberto Faenza, &quot;Il grande cocomero&quot; by Francesca Archibugi, &quot;The Profession of Arms&quot; (&quot;Il mestiere delle armi&quot;) by Olmi, &quot;L&#x27;ora di religione&quot; by Marco Bellocchio, &quot;Il ladro di bambini&quot;, &quot;Lamerica&quot;, &quot;The Keys to the House&quot; (&quot;Le chiavi di casa&quot;) by Gianni Amelio, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Scared&quot; (&quot;Io non-ho paura&quot;) by Gabriele Salvatores, &quot;Le Fate Ignoranti&quot;, &quot;Facing Windows&quot; (&quot;La finestra di fronte&quot;) by Ferzan Özpetek, &quot;Good Morning, Night&quot; (&quot;Buongiorno, notte&quot;) by Marco Bellocchio, &quot;The Best of Youth&quot; (&quot;La meglio gioventù&quot;) by Marco Tullio Giordana, &quot;The Beast in the Heart&quot; (&quot;La bestia nel cuore&quot;) by Cristina Comencini.
In 2008 Paolo Sorrentino&#x27;s &quot;Il Divo&quot;, a biographical film based on the life of Giulio Andreotti, won the Jury prize and &quot;Gomorra&quot;, a crime drama film, directed by Matteo Garrone won the Gran Prix at the Cannes Film Festival.

===2010s===

Paolo Sorrentino&#x27;s &quot;The Great Beauty&quot; (&quot;La Grande Bellezza&quot;) won the 2014 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

==100 Italian films to be saved==

The list of the 100 Italian films to be saved () was created with the aim to report &quot;100 films that have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978&quot;. The project was established in 2008 by the Venice Days festival section of the 65th Venice International Film Festival, in collaboration with Cinecittà Holding and with the support of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage.

The list was edited by Fabio Ferzetti, film critic of the newspaper &quot;Il Messaggero&quot;, in collaboration with film director Gianni Amelio and the writers and film critics Gian Piero Brunetta, Giovanni De Luna, Gianluca Farinelli, Giovanna Grignaffini, Paolo Mereghetti, Morando Morandini, Domenico Starnone and Sergio Toffetti.

It arose from the archival heritage of the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, which in 1943, had been removed by the Nazi occupiers, losing unique materials.

<text>The history of cinema in Poland is almost as long as the history of cinematography, and it has universally recognized achievements, even though Polish films tend to be less commercially available than films from several other European nations.

After World War II, the communist government built an auteur-based national cinema, trained hundreds of new directors and empowered them to make films. Filmmakers like Roman Polański, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Agnieszka Holland, Andrzej Wajda, Andrzej Żuławski, Andrzej Munk, and Jerzy Skolimowski impacted the development of Polish film-making. In more recent years, the industry has been producer-led with finance being the key to a film being made.

== History ==

===Early history===

The first cinema was founded in Łódź in 1899, several years after the invention of the Cinematograph. Initially dubbed &quot;Living Pictures Theatre&quot;, it gained much popularity and by the end of the next decade there were cinemas in almost every major town in Poland. Arguably the first Polish filmmaker was Kazimierz Prószyński, who filmed various short documentaries in Warsaw. His pleograph film camera had been patented before the Lumière brothers&#x27; invention and he is credited as the author of the earliest surviving Polish documentary titled &quot;Ślizgawka w Łazienkach&quot; (&quot;Skating-rink in the Royal Baths&quot;, also known as &quot;On skating-rink&quot;), made between 1894 and 1896, as well as the first short narrative films &quot;Powrót birbanta&quot; (&quot;Rake&#x27;s return home&quot;) and &quot;Przygoda dorożkarza&quot; (&quot;Cabman&#x27;s Adventure&quot;), both created in 1902. Another pioneer of cinema was Bolesław Matuszewski, who became one of the first filmmakers working for the Lumière company - and the official &quot;cinematographer&quot; of the Russian tsars in 1897.

The earliest surviving short film is &quot;Pruska kultura&quot; (&quot;Prussian Culture&quot;) and the earliest surviving feature film is &quot;Antoś pierwszy raz w Warszawie&quot; (&quot;Antoś for the First Time in Warsaw&quot;). Both of them were made in 1908, the first one by an unknown director and the second one by Antoni Fertner. The date of &quot;Antoś&quot;&#x27; première, October 22, 1908, is considered the founding date of the Polish film industry. Soon Polish artists started experimenting with other genres of cinema: in 1910 Władysław Starewicz made one of the first animated cartoons in the world - and the first to use the stop motion technique, the &quot;Piękna Lukanida&quot; (&quot;Beautiful Lukanida&quot;). By the start of World War I the cinema in Poland was already in full swing, with numerous adaptations of major works of Polish literature screened (notably the &quot;Dzieje grzechu&quot;, &quot;Meir Ezofowicz&quot; and &quot;Nad Niemnem&quot;).

During World War I the Polish cinema crossed borders. Films made in Warsaw or Vilnius were often rebranded with German-language intertitles and shown in Berlin. That was how a young actress Pola Negri (born Barbara Apolonia Chałupiec) gained fame in Germany and eventually became one of the European super-stars of silent film.

The first woman to direct a film in Poland and the only female film director of the Polish silent film era was Nina Niovilla. She debuted in 1918 in Berlin, and then directed her first Polish film titled &quot;Tamara&quot; (also known under the title &quot;Obrońcy Lwowa&quot;) in 1919.

During World War II, Polish filmmakers in Great Britain created the anti-Nazi color film &quot;Calling Mr. Smith&quot; (1943) about Nazi crimes in occupied Europe and about Nazi propaganda. It was one of the first anti-Nazi films in history being both an avant-garde and a documentary film.

===After WWII===

In November 1945, the communist government founded the film production and distribution organization Film Polski, and put the well-known Polish People&#x27;s Army filmmaker Aleksander Ford in charge. Starting with a few railway carriages full of film equipment taken from the Germans they proceed to train and build a Polish film industry. The FP output was limited; only thirteen features were released between 1947 and its dissolution in 1952, concentrating on Polish suffering at the hands of the Nazis. In 1947, Ford moved to help establish the new National Film School in Łódź, where he taught for 20 years.

The industry used imported cameras and film stocks. At first ORWO black and white film stock from East Germany and then Eastman colour negative stock and ORWO print stocks for rushes and release prints. Poland made its own lighting equipment. Because of the high costs of film stock Polish films were shot with very low shooting ratios, the amount of film stock used in shooting the film to length of the finished film. The equipment and film stock were not the best and budgets were modest but the film makers received probably the best training in the world from the Polish Film School. Another advantage was Film Polski&#x27;s status as a state organisation, so its film-makers had access to all Polish institutions and their cooperation in making their films. Film cameras were able to enter almost every aspect of Polish life.

The first film produced in Poland following the World War II was &quot;Zakazane piosenki&quot; (1946), directed by Leonard Buczkowski, which was seen by 10.8 million people (out of 23,8 total population) in its initial theatrical run. Buczkowski continued to make films regularly until his death in 1967. Other important films of the early post-World War II period were &quot;The Last Stage&quot; (1948), directed by Wanda Jakubowska, who continued to make films until the transition from communism to capitalism in 1989, and &quot;Border Street&quot; (1949), directed by Aleksander Ford.

By the mid-1950s, following the end of Stalinism in Poland, Film production was organised into film groups. A film group was a collection of film makers, led by an experienced film director and consisting of writers, film directors and production managers. They would write scripts, create budgets, apply for funding off the Ministry of Culture and produce the picture. They would hire actors and crew, and use studios and laboratories controlled by Film Polski.

The change in political climate gave rise to the Polish Film School movement, a training ground for some of the icons of the world cinematography, e.g., Roman Polanski (&quot;Knife in the Water&quot;, &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, &quot;Frantic&quot;, &quot;The Pianist&quot;) and Krzysztof Zanussi (a leading director of the so-called &quot;cinema of moral anxiety&quot; of the 1970s). Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s films offer insightful analyses of the universal element of the Polish experience - the struggle to maintain dignity under the most trying circumstances. His films defined several Polish generations. In 2000, Wajda was awarded an honorary Oscar for his overall contribution to cinema. Four of his films were nominated for Best Foreign Language Film award at Academy Awards with seven other Polish directors receiving one nomination each: Roman Polański, Jerzy Kawalerowicz, Jerzy Hoffman, Jerzy Antczak, Agnieszka Holland, Jan Komasa and Jerzy Skolimowski. In 2015, Polish filmmaker Paweł Pawlikowski received this award for his film &quot;Ida&quot;. In 2019, he was also nominated to the award for his next film &quot;Cold War&quot; in two categories - Best Foreign Language Film and Best Director.

It is also important to note that during the 1980s, the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland instituted the martial law to vanquish and censor all forms of opposition against the communist rule of the nation, including outlets such as cinema and radio. A notable film to have emerged during this period was Ryszard Bugajski&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Interrogation&quot; (&quot;Przesluchanie&quot;), which depicts the story of an unfortunate woman (played by Krystyna Janda) who is arrested and tortured by the secret police into confessing a crime she knows nothing about. The anti-communist nature of the film brought about the film&#x27;s over seven-year ban. In 1989, the ban was repealed after the overthrow of the Communist government in Poland, and the film was shown in theaters for the first time later that year. The film is still lauded today for its audacity in depicting the cruelty of the Stalinist regime, as many artists feared persecution during that time.
In the 1990s, Krzysztof Kieślowski won a universal acclaim with productions such as &quot;Dekalog&quot; (made for television), &quot;The Double Life of Véronique&quot; and the &quot;Three Colors&quot; trilogy. Another of the most famous movies in Poland is Krzysztof Krauze’s &quot;The Debt&quot;, which became a blockbuster. It showed the brutal reality of Polish capitalism and the growth of poverty. A considerable number of Polish film directors (e.g., Agnieszka Holland and Janusz Kamiński) have worked in American studios. Polish animated films - like those by Jan Lenica and Zbigniew Rybczyński (Oscar, 1983) - drew on a long tradition and continued to derive their inspiration from Poland&#x27;s graphic arts. Other notable Polish film directors include: Tomasz Bagiński, Małgorzata Szumowska, Jan Jakub Kolski, Jerzy Kawalerowicz, Stanisław Bareja and Janusz Zaorski.

Among prominent annual film festivals taking place in Poland are: Warsaw International Film Festival, Camerimage, International Festival of Independent Cinema Off Camera, New Horizons Film Festival as well as Gdynia Film Festival and Polish Film Awards.

====Cinema audience====

The Communist government invested resources into building a sophisticated cinema audience. All the cinema were state owned and consisted of first run premiere cinema, local cinema and art house cinemas. Tickets were cheap and students and old people received discounts. In the city of Lodz there were 36 cinemas in the 1970s showing films from all over the world. There were the Italian films of Fellini, French comedies, American crime movies such as Don Siegel&#x27;s &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; . Films were shown in their original versions with Polish subtitles. Anti-Communist and Cold War films were not shown, but a bigger restriction was the cost of some films. There were popular film magazines like &quot;Film&quot; and &quot;Screen&quot;, critical magazines such as &quot;Kino&quot;. This all helped to build a well informed film audience.

<text>The , also known domestically as , has a history that spans more than 100 years. Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries in the world; as of 2022, it was the fourth largest by number of feature films produced, producing 634 films, and third largest in terms of box office revenue, standing at $1.5 billion. Films have been produced in Japan since 1897.

During the 1950s, a period dubbed the &quot;Golden Age of Japanese cinema&quot;, the &quot;jidaigeki&quot; films of Akira Kurosawa as well as the science fiction films of Ishirō Honda and Eiji Tsuburaya gained Japanese cinema international praise and made these directors universally renown and highly influential. Some of the Japanese films of this period are now rated some of the greatest of all time: &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; (1953) ranked number three in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; list of the 100 greatest films of all time and also topped the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; directors&#x27; poll of The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time, dethroning &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, while Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954) was voted the greatest foreign-language film of all time in BBC&#x27;s 2018 poll of 209 critics in 43 countries. Japan has also won the Academy Award for the Best International Feature Film five times, more than any other Asian country.

Japan&#x27;s Big Four film studios are Toho, Toei, Shochiku and Kadokawa, which are the only members of the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan (MPPAJ). The annual Japan Academy Film Prize hosted by the Nippon Academy-shō Association is considered to be the Japanese equivalent of the Academy Awards.

==History==

===Early silent era===

The kinetoscope, first shown commercially by Thomas Edison in the United States in 1894, was first shown in Japan in November 1896. The Vitascope and the Lumière Brothers&#x27; Cinematograph were first presented in Japan in early 1897, by businessmen such as Inabata Katsutaro. Lumière cameramen were the first to shoot films in Japan. Moving pictures, however, were not an entirely new experience for the Japanese because of their rich tradition of pre-cinematic devices such as &quot;gentō&quot; (&quot;utsushi-e&quot;) or the magic lantern. The first successful Japanese film in late 1897 showed sights in Tokyo.

In 1898, some ghost films were made, such as the Shirō Asano shorts &quot;Bake Jizo&quot; (Jizo the Spook / 化け地蔵) and &quot;Shinin no sosei&quot; (Resurrection of a Corpse). The first documentary, the short &quot;Geisha no teodori&quot; (芸者の手踊り), was made in June 1899. Tsunekichi Shibata made a number of early films, including &quot;Momijigari&quot;, an 1899 record of two famous actors performing a scene from a well-known kabuki play. Early films were influenced by traditional theater – for example, kabuki and bunraku.

===20th century===
At the dawn of the 20th century, theaters in Japan hired benshi, storytellers who sat next to the screen and narrated silent movies. They were descendants of kabuki jōruri, kōdan storytellers, theater barkers and other forms of oral storytelling. Benshi could be accompanied by music like silent films from cinema of the West. With the advent of sound in the early 1930s, the benshi gradually declined.

In 1908, Shōzō Makino, considered the pioneering director of Japanese film, began his influential career with &quot;Honnōji gassen&quot; (本能寺合戦), produced for Yokota Shōkai. Shōzō recruited Matsunosuke Onoe, a former kabuki actor, to star in his productions. Onoe became Japan&#x27;s first film star, appearing in over 1,000 films, mostly shorts, between 1909 and 1926. The pair pioneered the &quot;jidaigeki&quot; genre. Tokihiko Okada was a popular romantic lead of the same era.

The first Japanese film production studio was built in 1909 by the Yoshizawa Shōten company in Tokyo.

The first female Japanese performer to appear in a film professionally was the dancer/actress Tokuko Nagai Takagi, who appeared in four shorts for the American-based Thanhouser Company between 1911 and 1914.

Among intellectuals, critiques of Japanese cinema grew in the 1910s and eventually developed into a movement that transformed Japanese film. Film criticism began with early film magazines such as &quot;Katsudō shashinkai&quot; (begun in 1909) and a full-length book written by Yasunosuke Gonda in 1914, but many early film critics often focused on chastising the work of studios like Nikkatsu and Tenkatsu for being too theatrical (using, for instance, elements from kabuki and shinpa such as onnagata) and for not utilizing what were considered more cinematic techniques to tell stories, instead relying on benshi. In what was later named the Pure Film Movement, writers in magazines such as &quot;Kinema Record&quot; called for a broader use of such cinematic techniques. Some of these critics, such as Norimasa Kaeriyama, went on to put their ideas into practice by directing such films as &quot;The Glow of Life&quot; (1918), which was one of the first films to use actresses (in this case, Harumi Hanayagi). There were parallel efforts elsewhere in the film industry. In his 1917 film &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (based on the play by Choji Nakauchi, based in turn on the German film, &quot;Gendarm Möbius&quot;), Masao Inoue started using techniques new to the silent film era, such as the close-up and cut back. The Pure Film Movement was central in the development of the gendaigeki and scriptwriting.

New studios established around 1920, such as Shochiku and Taikatsu, aided the cause for reform. At Taikatsu, Thomas Kurihara directed films scripted by the novelist Junichiro Tanizaki, who was a strong advocate of film reform. Even Nikkatsu produced reformist films under the direction of Eizō Tanaka. By the mid-1920s, actresses had replaced onnagata and films used more of the devices pioneered by Inoue. Some of the most discussed silent films from Japan are those of Kenji Mizoguchi, whose later works (including &quot;Ugetsu&quot;/&quot;Ugetsu Monogatari&quot;) retain a very high reputation.

Japanese films gained popularity in the mid-1920s against foreign films, in part fueled by the popularity of movie stars and a new style of jidaigeki. Directors such as Daisuke Itō and Masahiro Makino made samurai films like &quot;A Diary of Chuji&#x27;s Travels&quot; and &quot;Roningai&quot; featuring rebellious antiheroes in fast-cut fight scenes that were both critically acclaimed and commercial successes. Some stars, such as Tsumasaburo Bando, Kanjūrō Arashi, Chiezō Kataoka, Takako Irie and Utaemon Ichikawa, were inspired by Makino Film Productions and formed their own independent production companies where directors such as Hiroshi Inagaki, Mansaku Itami and Sadao Yamanaka honed their skills. Director Teinosuke Kinugasa created a production company to produce the experimental masterpiece &quot;A Page of Madness&quot;, starring Masao Inoue, in 1926. Many of these companies, while surviving during the silent era against major studios like Nikkatsu, Shochiku, Teikine, and Toa Studios, could not survive the cost involved in converting to sound.

With the rise of left-wing political movements and labor unions at the end of the 1920s, there arose so-called tendency films with left-leaning tendencies. Directors Kenji Mizoguchi, Daisuke Itō, Shigeyoshi Suzuki, and Tomu Uchida were prominent examples. In contrast to these commercially produced 35 mm films, the Marxist Proletarian Film League of Japan (Prokino) made works independently in smaller gauges (such as 9.5mm and 16mm), with more radical intentions. Tendency films suffered from severe censorship heading into the 1930s, and Prokino members were arrested and the movement effectively crushed. Such moves by the government had profound effects on the expression of political dissent in 1930s cinema. Films from this period include: &quot;Sakanaya Honda, Jitsuroku Chushingura, Horaijima, Orochi, Maboroshi, Kurutta Ippeji, Jujiro, Kurama Tengu: Kyōfu Jidai&quot;, and &quot;Kurama Tengu&quot;.

The 1923 earthquake, the bombing of Tokyo during World War II, and the natural effects of time and Japan&#x27;s humidity on flammable and unstable nitrate film have resulted in a great dearth of surviving films from this period.Ref?

Unlike in the West, silent films were still being produced in Japan well into the 1930s; as late as 1938, a third of Japanese films were silent. For instance, Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s &quot;An Inn in Tokyo&quot; (1935), considered a precursor to the neorealism genre, was a silent film. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan&#x27;s first feature-length talkie was &quot;Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato&quot; (1930), which used the &quot;Mina Talkie System&quot;. Notable talkies of this period include Mikio Naruse&#x27;s &quot;Wife, Be Like A Rose!&quot; (&quot;Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni&quot;, 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S.; Kenji Mizoguchi&#x27;s &quot;Sisters of the Gion&quot; (&quot;Gion no shimai&quot;, 1936); &quot;Osaka Elegy&quot; (1936); &quot;The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums&quot; (1939); and Sadao Yamanaka&#x27;s &quot;Humanity and Paper Balloons&quot; (1937).

Film criticism shared this vitality, with many film journals such as &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; and newspapers printing detailed discussions of the cinema of the day, both at home and abroad. A cultured &quot;impressionist&quot; criticism pursued by critics such as Tadashi Iijima, Fuyuhiko Kitagawa, and Matsuo Kishi was dominant, but opposed by leftist critics such as Akira Iwasaki and Genjū Sasa who sought an ideological critique of films.

The 1930s also saw increased government involvement in cinema, which was symbolized by the passing of the Film Law, which gave the state more authority over the film industry, in 1939. The government encouraged some forms of cinema, producing propaganda films and promoting documentary films (also called &quot;bunka eiga&quot; or &quot;culture films&quot;), with important documentaries being made by directors such as Fumio Kamei. Realism was in favor; film theorists such as Taihei Imamura and Heiichi Sugiyama advocated for documentary or realist drama, while directors such as Hiroshi Shimizu and Tomotaka Tasaka produced fiction films that were strongly realistic in style. Films reinforced the importance of traditional Japanese values against the rise of the Westernised modern girl, a character epitomised by Shizue Tatsuta in Ozu&#x27;s 1930 film &quot;Young Lady&quot;.

====Wartime movies====

Because of World War II and the weak economy, unemployment became widespread in Japan, and the cinema industry suffered.

During this period, when Japan was expanding its empire, the Japanese government saw cinema as a propaganda tool to show the glory and invincibility of the Empire of Japan. Thus, many films from this period depict patriotic and militaristic themes. However unlike most wartime films the Japanese tended to tell it like it is, showing the hardships soldiers face everyday in battle. Marching through mud and staying in small unknown towns. In 1942, Kajiro Yamamoto&#x27;s film &quot;The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya&quot; portrayed the attack on Pearl Harbor; the film made use of special effects directed by Eiji Tsuburaya, including a miniature scale model of Pearl Harbor itself.

Kamishibai (紙芝居) or paper theater was a popular form of street entertainment, especially for the children. Kamishibai was often used to tell stories of Buddhist deities and the history of some Buddhist temples. In 1920 it started out as normal storytelling for the children, but in about 1932, it started to lean more to a militaristic viewpoint.

Yoshiko Yamaguchi was a very popular actress. She rose to international stardom with 22 wartime movies. The Manchukuo Film Association let her use the Chinese name Li Xianglan so she could represent Chinese roles in Japanese propaganda movies. After the war she used her official Japanese name and starred in an additional 29 movies. She was elected as a member of the Japanese parliament in the 1970s and served for 18 years.

Akira Kurosawa made his feature film debut with &quot;Sugata Sanshiro&quot; in 1943.

====American occupation====
After the surrender of Japan in 1945, wartime controls and restrictions on the Japanese film industry were abolished, and the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) established the Civil Information and Education Section (CIE), which came to manage the industry. All film proposals and screenplays were to be processed and approved by CIE. The script would then be processed by the Civil Censorship Detachment (CCD), which was under the direct control of American military. Pre-war and wartime films were also subject to review, and over 500 were condemned, with half of them being burned. In addition, Toho and Daiei pre-emptively destroyed films they thought to be incriminating. In November 1945, CIE announced that it would forbid films deemed to be: 
# infused with militarism;
# showing revenge as a legitimate motive;
# nationalistic;
# chauvinistic and anti-foreign;
# distorting historical facts;
# favoring racial or religious discrimination;
# portraying feudal loyalty or contempt of life as desirable and honorable;
# approving suicide either directly or indirectly;
# dealing with or approving the subjugation or degradation of women;
# depicting brutality, violence or evil as triumphant;
# anti-democratic;
# condoning the exploitation of children; or
# at variance with the spirit or letter of the Potsdam Declaration or any SCAP directive

A major consequence of these restrictions was that the production of &quot;jidaigeki&quot; films, especially those involving samurai, became effectively impossible. A notable case of censorship was of the war film &quot;Escape at Dawn,&quot; written by Akira Kurosawa and Senkichi Taniguchi, which was re-written over a dozen times at the request of CIE, largely erasing the original content of the story. On the other hand, the CIE favored the production of films that reflected the policies of the Occupation, such as agricultural reform and the organization of labor unions, and promoted the peaceful redevelopment of Japan and the rights of individuals.
Significant movies among them are, Setsuko Hara appeared in Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;No Regrets for Our Youth&quot; (1946), Kōzaburō Yoshimura&#x27;s &quot;A Ball at the Anjo House&quot; (1947), Tadashi Imai&#x27;s &quot;Aoi sanmyaku&quot; (1949), etc. It gained national popularity as a star symbolizing the beginning of a new era. In Yasushi Sasaki&#x27;s &quot;Hatachi no Seishun&quot; (1946), the first kiss scene of a Japanese movie was filmed. The Mainichi Film Award was also created in 1946.

The first movie released after the war was &quot;Soyokaze&quot;, directed by Yasushi Sasaki, and the theme song &quot;Ringo no Uta&quot; was a big hit.

The first collaborations between Akira Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune were &quot;Drunken Angel&quot; in 1948 and &quot;Stray Dog&quot; in 1949. Yasujirō Ozu directed the critically and commercially successful &quot;Late Spring&quot; in 1949.

In the later half of the Occupation, the Reverse Course came into effect. Left-wing filmmakers displaced from the major studios in the Red Purge joined those displaced after suppression of the Toho strikes, forming a new independent film movement. Directors such as Fumio Kamei, Tadashi Imai and Satsuo Yamamoto were members of the Japanese Communist Party. Independent social realist dramas saw a small and temporary boom amid the wave of sentimental war dramas produced after the end of Occupation.

====Golden Age====

The 1950s are widely considered the Golden Age of Japanese cinema. Three Japanese films from this decade (&quot;Rashomon&quot;, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;) appeared in the top ten of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;″s critics&#x27; and directors&#x27; polls for the best films of all time in 2002. They also appeared in the 2012 polls, with &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; (1953) dethroning &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; at the top of the 2012 directors&#x27; poll.

War movies covering themes previously restricted by SCAP began to be produced, such as Hideo Sekigawa&#x27;s &quot;Listen to the Voices of the Sea&quot; (1950), Tadashi Imai&#x27;s &quot;Himeyuri no Tô&quot; (&quot;Tower of the Lilies,&quot; 1953), Keisuke Kinoshita&#x27;s &quot;Twenty-Four Eyes&quot; (1954) and Kon Ichikawa&#x27;s &quot;The Burmese Harp&quot; (1956). Works showcasing tragic and sentimental retrospectives of the war experience became a public phenomenon. Other films produced include &quot;Battleship Yamato&quot; (1953) and &quot;Eagle of the Pacific&quot; (1953). Under these circumstances, movies such as &quot;Emperor Meiji and the Russo-Japanese War&quot; (明治天皇と日露大戦争, 1957), where Kanjūrō Arashi played Emperor Meiji, also appeared. It was a situation that was unthinkable before the war, the commercialization of the Emperor who was supposed to be sacred and inviolable.

The period after the American Occupation led to a rise in diversity in movie distribution thanks to the increased output and popularity of the film studios of Toho, Daiei, Shochiku, Nikkatsu, and Toei. This period gave rise to the six great artists of Japanese cinema: Masaki Kobayashi, Akira Kurosawa, Ishirō Honda, Eiji Tsuburaya, Kenji Mizoguchi, and Yasujirō Ozu. Each director dealt with the effects the war and subsequent occupation by America in unique and innovative ways. During this decade, the works of Kurosawa, Honda, and Tsuburaya would become the first Japanese films to be widely distributed in foreign theaters.

The decade started with Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950), which won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1951 and the Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1952, and marked the entrance of Japanese cinema onto the world stage. It was also the breakout role for legendary star Toshiro Mifune. In 1953, &quot;Entotsu no mieru basho&quot; by Heinosuke Gosho was in competition at the 3rd Berlin International Film Festival.

The first Japanese film in color was &quot;Carmen Comes Home&quot; directed by Keisuke Kinoshita and released in 1951. There was also a black-and-white version of this film available. &quot;Tokyo File 212&quot; (1951) was the first American feature film to be shot entirely in Japan. The lead roles were played by Florence Marly and Robert Peyton. It featured the geisha Ichimaru in a short cameo. Suzuki Ikuzo&#x27;s Tonichi Enterprises Company co-produced the film. &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;, a 1953 film by Teinosuke Kinugasa, was the first movie that filmed using Eastmancolor film, &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; was both Daiei&#x27;s first color film and the first Japanese color movie to be released outside Japan, receiving an Academy Honorary Award in 1954 for Best Costume Design by Sanzo Wada and an Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It also won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival, the first Japanese film to achieve that honour.

The year 1954 saw two of Japan&#x27;s most influential films released. The first was the Kurosawa epic &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, about a band of hired samurai who protect a helpless village from a rapacious gang of thieves. The same year, Kurosawa&#x27;s friend and colleague Ishirō Honda directed the anti-nuclear monster-drama &quot;Godzilla&quot;, featuring award-winning effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. The latter film was first ever Japanese film to be given a wide release throughout the United States, where it was heavily re-edited, and featured new footage with actor Raymond Burr for its distribution in 1956 as &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot;. Although it was edited for its Western release, Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of &quot;kaiju&quot; films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Also in 1954, another Kurosawa film, &quot;Ikiru&quot; was in competition at the 4th Berlin International Film Festival.

In 1955, Hiroshi Inagaki won an Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film for Part I of his &quot;Samurai&quot; trilogy and in 1958 won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for &quot;Rickshaw Man&quot;. Kon Ichikawa directed two anti-war dramas: &quot;The Burmese Harp&quot; (1956), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, and &quot;Fires on the Plain&quot; (1959), along with &quot;Enjo&quot; (1958), which was adapted from Yukio Mishima&#x27;s novel &quot;Temple of The Golden Pavilion&quot;. Masaki Kobayashi made three films which would collectively become known as &quot;The Human Condition Trilogy&quot;: &quot;No Greater Love&quot; (1959), and &quot;The Road to Eternity&quot; (1959). The trilogy was completed in 1961, with &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Prayer&quot;.

Kenji Mizoguchi, who died in 1956, ended his career with a series of masterpieces including &quot;The Life of Oharu&quot; (1952), &quot;Ugetsu&quot; (1953) and &quot;Sansho the Bailiff&quot; (1954). He won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival for &quot;Ugetsu&quot;. Mizoguchi&#x27;s films often deal with the tragedies inflicted on women by Japanese society. Mikio Naruse made &quot;Repast&quot; (1950), &quot;Late Chrysanthemums&quot; (1954), &quot;Sound of the Mountain&quot; (1954) and &quot;Floating Clouds&quot; (1955). Yasujirō Ozu began directing color films beginning with &quot;Equinox Flower&quot; (1958), and later &quot;Good Morning&quot; (1959) and &quot;Floating Weeds&quot; (1958), which was adapted from his earlier silent &quot;A Story of Floating Weeds&quot; (1934), and was shot by &quot;Rashomon&quot; and &quot;Sansho the Bailiff&quot; cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa.

The Blue Ribbon Awards were established in 1950. The first winner for Best Film was &quot;Until We Meet Again&quot; by Tadashi Imai.

The number of films produced, and the cinema audience reached a peak in the 1960s. Most films were shown in double bills, with one half of the bill being a &quot;program picture&quot; or B movie. A typical program picture was shot in four weeks. The demand for these program pictures in quantity meant the growth of film series such as &quot;The Hoodlum Soldier&quot; or &quot;Akumyo&quot;.

The huge level of activity of 1960s Japanese cinema also resulted in many classics. Akira Kurosawa directed the 1961 classic &quot;Yojimbo&quot;. Yasujirō Ozu made his final film, &quot;An Autumn Afternoon&quot;, in 1962. Mikio Naruse directed the wide screen melodrama &quot;When a Woman Ascends the Stairs&quot; in 1960; his final film was 1967&#x27;s &quot;Scattered Clouds&quot;.

Kon Ichikawa captured the watershed 1964 Olympics in his three-hour documentary &quot;Tokyo Olympiad&quot; (1965). Seijun Suzuki was fired by Nikkatsu for &quot;making films that don&#x27;t make any sense and don&#x27;t make any money&quot; after his surrealist yakuza flick &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; (1967).

The 1960s were the peak years of the &quot;Japanese New Wave&quot; movement, which began in the 1950s and continued through the early 1970s. Nagisa Oshima, Kaneto Shindo, Masahiro Shinoda, Susumu Hani and Shohei Imamura emerged as major filmmakers during the decade. Oshima&#x27;s &quot;Cruel Story of Youth&quot;, &quot;Night and Fog in Japan&quot; and &quot;Death by Hanging&quot;, along with Shindo&#x27;s &quot;Onibaba&quot;, Hani&#x27;s &quot;Kanojo to kare&quot; and Imamura&#x27;s &quot;The Insect Woman&quot;, became some of the better-known examples of Japanese New Wave filmmaking. Documentary played a crucial role in the New Wave, as directors such as Hani, Kazuo Kuroki, Toshio Matsumoto, and Hiroshi Teshigahara moved from documentary into fiction film, while feature filmmakers like Oshima and Imamura also made documentaries. Shinsuke Ogawa and Noriaki Tsuchimoto became the most important documentarists: &quot;two figures [that] tower over the landscape of Japanese documentary.&quot;

Teshigahara&#x27;s &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; (1964) won the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and was nominated for Best Director and Best Foreign Language Film Oscars. Masaki Kobayashi&#x27;s &quot;Kwaidan&quot; (1965) also picked up the Special Jury Prize at Cannes and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. &quot;Bushido, Samurai Saga&quot; by Tadashi Imai won the Golden Bear at the 13th Berlin International Film Festival. &quot;Immortal Love&quot; by Keisuke Kinoshita and &quot;Twin Sisters of Kyoto&quot; and &quot;Portrait of Chieko&quot;, both by Noboru Nakamura, also received nominations for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. &quot;Lost Spring&quot;, also by Nakamura, was in competition for the Golden Bear at the 17th Berlin International Film Festival.

The 1970s saw the cinema audience drop due to the spread of television. Total audience declined from 1.2 billion in 1960 to 0.2 billion in 1980.
Film companies refused to hire top actors and directors, not even the companies&#x27; production skills to the television industry, thereby making the film companies losing money. 

Film companies fought back in various ways, such as the bigger budget films of Kadokawa Pictures, or including increasingly sexual or violent content and language which could not be shown on television. The resulting pink film industry became the stepping stone for many young independent filmmakers. The seventies also saw the start of the &quot;idol eiga&quot;, films starring young &quot;idols&quot;, who would bring in audiences due to their fame and popularity.

Toshiya Fujita made the revenge film &quot;Lady Snowblood&quot; in 1973. In the same year, Yoshishige Yoshida made the film &quot;Coup d&#x27;État&quot;, a portrait of Ikki Kita, the leader of the Japanese coup of February 1936. Its experimental cinematography and mise-en-scène, as well as its avant-garde score by Toshi Ichiyanagi, garnered it wide critical acclaim within Japan.

In 1976, the Hochi Film Award was created. The first winner for Best Film was &quot;The Inugamis&quot; by Kon Ichikawa. Nagisa Oshima directed &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot; (1976), a film detailing a crime of passion involving Sada Abe set in the 1930s. Controversial for its explicit sexual content, it has never been seen uncensored in Japan.

Kinji Fukasaku completed the epic &quot;Battles Without Honor and Humanity&quot; series of yakuza films. Yoji Yamada introduced the commercially successful &quot;Tora-San&quot; series, while also directing other films, notably the popular &quot;The Yellow Handkerchief&quot;, which won the first Japan Academy Prize for Best Film in 1978. New wave filmmakers Susumu Hani and Shōhei Imamura retreated to documentary work, though Imamura made a dramatic return to feature filmmaking with &quot;Vengeance Is Mine&quot; (1979).

&quot;Dodes&#x27;ka-den&quot; by Akira Kurosawa and &quot;Sandakan No. 8&quot; by Kei Kumai were nominated to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

The 1980s saw the decline of the major Japanese film studios and their associated chains of cinemas, with major studios Toho and Toei barely staying in business, Shochiku supported almost solely by the &quot;Otoko wa tsurai yo&quot; films, and Nikkatsu declining even further.

Of the older generation of directors, Akira Kurosawa directed &quot;Kagemusha&quot; (1980), which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival, and &quot;Ran&quot; (1985). Seijun Suzuki made a comeback beginning with &quot;Zigeunerweisen&quot; in 1980. Shohei Imamura won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival for &quot;The Ballad of Narayama&quot; (1983). Yoshishige Yoshida made &quot;A Promise&quot; (1986), his first film since 1973&#x27;s &quot;Coup d&#x27;État&quot;.

New directors who appeared in the 1980s include actor Juzo Itami, who directed his first film, &quot;The Funeral&quot;, in 1984, and achieved critical and box office success with &quot;Tampopo&quot; in 1985. Shinji Sōmai, an artistically inclined populist director who made films like the youth-focused &quot;Typhoon Club&quot;, and the critically acclaimed Roman porno &quot;Love Hotel&quot; among others. Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who would generate international attention beginning in the mid-1990s, made his initial debut with pink films and genre horror.

During the 1980s, anime rose in popularity, with new animated movies released every summer and winter, often based upon popular anime television series. Mamoru Oshii released his landmark &quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot; in 1985 while Hayao Miyazaki adapted his manga series, &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind,&quot; into a feature film of the same name in 1984. Katsuhiro Otomo followed suit by adapting his own manga &quot;Akira&quot; into a feature film of the same name in 1988.

Eventually the home video made it possible to where the Japanese civilians, and eventually citizens in other countries, could watch these films individually. This would increase sales in the direct-to-video film industry, allowing for further developments, such as DVD&#x27;s and eventual streaming services, to develop.

Mini theaters, a type of independent movie theater characterized by a smaller size and seating capacity in comparison to larger movie theaters, gained popularity during the 1980s. Mini theaters helped bring independent and arthouse films from other countries, as well as films produced in Japan by unknown Japanese filmmakers, to Japanese audiences.

==== Heisei period ====
Because of economic recessions, the number of movie theaters in Japan had been steadily decreasing since the 1960s. The number of cinemas was under 2,000 in 1993 compared to more than 7,000 in 1960. The 1990s saw the reversal of this trend and the introduction of the multiplex in Japan. At the same time, the popularity of mini theaters continued.

Takeshi Kitano emerged as a significant filmmaker with works such as &quot;Sonatine&quot; (1993), &quot;Kids Return&quot; (1996) and &quot;Hana-bi&quot; (1997), which was given the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Shōhei Imamura again won the Palme d&#x27;Or (shared with Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami), this time for &quot;The Eel&quot; (1997). He became the fifth two-time recipient, joining Alf Sjöberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Emir Kusturica and Bille August.

Kiyoshi Kurosawa gained international recognition following the release of &quot;Cure&quot; (1997). Takashi Miike launched a prolific career with titles such as &quot;Audition&quot; (1999), &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Bird People in China&quot; (1998). Former documentary filmmaker Hirokazu Koreeda launched an acclaimed feature career with &quot;Maborosi&quot; (1996) and &quot;After Life&quot; (1999).

Hayao Miyazaki directed two mammoth box office and critical successes, &quot;Porco Rosso&quot; (1992) – which beat &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982) as the highest-grossing film in Japan – and &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; (1997), which also claimed the top box office spot until &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997).

Several new anime directors rose to widespread recognition, bringing with them notions of anime as not only entertainment, but modern art. Mamoru Oshii released the internationally acclaimed philosophical science fiction action film &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; in 1996. Satoshi Kon directed the award-winning psychological thriller &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;. Hideaki Anno also gained considerable recognition with &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; in 1997.

In the beginning of 21st century, Japan has been referenced numerous times in popular culture, which was a relatively successful one for Japanese film industry, returning to the idea of a second Japanese New Wave” in their cinematic releases. The country has appeared as a setting and topic multiple times in film, poetry, television, and music. The number of films being shown in Japan steadily increased, with about 821 films released in 2006. Films based on Japanese television series were especially popular during this period. Anime films now accounted for 60 percent of Japanese film production and would become one of the world’s leading producers of animated cinema. The 1990s and 2000s are considered to be &quot;Japanese Cinema&#x27;s Second Golden Age&quot;, due to the immense popularity of anime, both within Japan and overseas.

Although not a commercial success, &quot;All About Lily Chou-Chou&quot; directed by Shunji Iwai was honored at the Berlin, the Yokohama and the Shanghai Film Festivals in 2001. Takeshi Kitano appeared in &quot;Battle Royale&quot; and directed and starred in &quot;Dolls&quot; and &quot;Zatoichi&quot;. Beginning in the late 1990s, the J-horror film genre began to boom, as films such as &quot;Ringu,&quot; &quot;Kairo&quot;, &quot;Dark Water&quot;, &quot;Yogen&quot;, the &quot;Grudge&quot; series and &quot;One Missed Call&quot; met with commercial success. In 2004, &quot;&quot;, directed by Ryuhei Kitamura, was released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Godzilla. In 2005, director Seijun Suzuki made his 56th film, &quot;Princess Raccoon&quot;. Hirokazu Koreeda claimed film festival awards around the world with two of his films &quot;Distance&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows&quot;. Female film director Naomi Kawase&#x27;s film &quot;The Mourning Forest&quot; won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007. Yoji Yamada, director of the Otoko wa Tsurai yo series, made a trilogy of acclaimed revisionist samurai films, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Twilight Samurai&quot;, followed by &quot;The Hidden Blade&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Love and Honor&quot; in 2006. In 2008, &quot;Departures&quot; won the Academy Award for best foreign language film.

In anime, Hayao Miyazaki directed &quot;Spirited Away&quot; in 2001, breaking Japanese box office records and winning several awards—including the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2003—followed by &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; and &quot;Ponyo&quot; in 2004 and 2008 respectively. In 2004, Mamoru Oshii released the anime movie &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot; which received critical praise around the world. His 2008 film &quot;The Sky Crawlers&quot; was met with similarly positive international reception. Satoshi Kon also released three quieter, but nonetheless highly successful films: &quot;Millennium Actress&quot;, &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot;, and &quot;Paprika&quot;. Katsuhiro Otomo released &quot;Steamboy&quot;, his first animated project since the 1995 short film compilation &quot;Memories&quot;, in 2004. In collaboration with Studio 4C, American director Michael Arias released &quot;Tekkon Kinkreet&quot; in 2008, to international acclaim. After several years of directing primarily lower-key live-action films, Hideaki Anno formed his own production studio and revisited his still-popular &quot;Evangelion&quot; franchise with the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; tetralogy, a new series of films providing an alternate retelling of the original story.

Some Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Post-war period examples include: Tokyo Joe, My Geisha, Tokyo Story and the James Bond film You Only Live Twice; recent examples include Lost in Translation and The Last Samurai (both in 2003), Kill Bill: Volume 1 and 2 and The Day After Tomorrow (all in 2004), Memoirs of a Geisha (2005), The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and Babel (both in 2006), The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008), 2012 (2009), Inception (2010), Emperor (2012), Pacific Rim and The Wolverine (both in 2013), Geostorm (2017), and (2019).

Since February 2000, the Japan Film Commission Promotion Council was established. On November 16, 2001, the Japanese Foundation for the Promotion of the Arts laws were presented to the House of Representatives. These laws were intended to promote the production of media arts, including film scenery, and stipulate that the government – on both the national and local levels – must lend aid in order to preserve film media. The laws were passed on November 30 and came into effect on December 7. In 2003, at a gathering for the Agency of Cultural Affairs, twelve policies were proposed in a written report to allow public-made films to be promoted and shown at the Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art.

Japanese cinema has always been perceived as either having feminist male directors as well as female directors, furthering the notion of the importance of women in Japanese cinema. This is proven most profusely in 2009, where a symposium for the Nippon Connection Festival was held, which the entire meeting was devoted to women: as a subject, as female directors, and as their importance to Japanese cinema. The impact of women is seen in various film festivals, including ‘Peaches,’ where Japanese women graduates were allowed to display their achievements in the cinematic field willingly. Through these interpretations and diverse views of males in cinema, women have a major impact on Japanese cinema, about politically and socially: they themselves are a part of the Japanese narrative and their stories need to be studied in films for audiences to fully grasp their stories.

Four films have so far received international recognition by being selected to compete in major film festivals: &quot;Caterpillar&quot; by Kōji Wakamatsu was in competition for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival and won the Silver Bear for Best Actress, &quot;Outrage&quot; by Takeshi Kitano was In Competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, &quot;Himizu&quot; by Sion Sono was in competition for the Golden Lion at the 68th Venice International Film Festival.

In March 2011, Japanese film and television industry was afflicted by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster, which was greatly suffered due to ongoing triple disaster. However, many Japanese studios were officially closed or reorganized to prevent the triple disaster. As of result, many of Japanese studios began to reopen and production rates have increased.

In October 2011 (after fully reopening of Japanese film and television industry), Takashi Miike&#x27;s &quot;Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai&quot; was In Competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, the first 3D film ever to screen In Competition at Cannes. The film was co-produced by British independent producer Jeremy Thomas, who had successfully broken Japanese titles such as Nagisa Oshima&#x27;s &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence&quot; and &quot; Taboo&quot;, Takeshi Kitano&#x27;s &quot;Brother&quot;, and Miike&#x27;s &quot;13 Assassins&quot; onto the international stage as producer.

In 2018, Hirokazu Kore-eda won the Palme d&#x27;Or for his movie &quot;Shoplifters&quot; at the 71st Cannes Film Festival, a festival that also featured Ryūsuke Hamaguchi&#x27;s &quot;Asako I &amp; II&quot; in competition.

===Reiwa period===
The 2020 Japanese epic disaster drama film Fukushima 50, released on 6 March 2020, directed by Setsurō Wakamatsu and written by Yōichi Maekawa. The film is based on the book by Ryusho Kadota, titled &quot;On the Brink: The Inside Story of Fukushima Daiichi&quot;, and it is the first Japanese film to depict the disaster. 

In early 2020, the Japanese film and television industry was afflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which greatly suffered due to health requirements. This gave the nation its worst day of film and television industry impacted by health crises since the end of World War II. From the first (of many) &#x27;health lockdowns&#x27; until the end of September 2021, many Japanese studios were closed or reorganized to suit the legal requirements for spread prevention which ultimately resulted in the suspension of filming for many movies, however, it did not stop from people wanting to see movies. Despite this pandemic occurring, many films were slowly being reintroduced to Japanese cinemas, which changed how Japan would approach cinema within the following years. From 2021-2022, there was the reinstating of Japanese cinema to Japanese audiences, as theater attendance had increased from the original 54.5% from 2020, to about 78% by 2022. In 2022 alone, though there was a significant decrease from 2019’s numbers, there were 590 movie theatres that were open and available to the public, allowing for the public to reengage with normal activities while being amid the pandemic. 

In October 2020 (after the reopening film industry), a Japanese anime film &quot;Demon Slayer: Mugen Train&quot; based on the &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot; manga series broke all box-office records in the country, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in Japan, the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time and the highest-grossing film of 2020.

In October 2021, a Japanese drama-road film Drive My Car won Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Golden Globe Awards and received the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film at the 94th Academy Awards.

In May 2023, a Japanese drama film Perfect Days won Best Actor and Ecumenical Jury at the 76th Cannes Film Festival. Besides that a Japanese psychological dramatic mystery thriller film Monster won Best Screenplay as well as the Queer Palm at the same festival.

In September 2023, a Japanese drama mystery film Evil Does Not Exist won Grand Jury and FIPRESCI Award at the 80th Venice International Film Festival and also awarded Best Film at the 2023 BFI London Film Festival.

Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;The Boy and the Heron&quot; and Takashi Yamazaki&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot; (both released in 2023) each won an award at the 96th Academy Awards and garnered critical acclaim. &quot;The Boy and the Heron&quot; also won Best Animated Feature Film at the 81st Golden Globe Awards, the first non-English-language animated film to do so. Likewise, &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot; became the first foreign-language film to win the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

<text>The cinema of China is the filmmaking and film industry of mainland China, one of three distinct historical threads of Chinese-language cinema together with the cinema of Hong Kong and the cinema of Taiwan. China is the home of the largest movie and drama production complex and film studios in the world, the Oriental Movie Metropolis and Hengdian World Studios. In 2012 the country became the second-largest market in the world by box office receipts. In 2016, the gross box office in China was (). China has also become a major hub of business for Hollywood studios.

In November 2016, China passed a film law banning content deemed harmful to the &quot;dignity, honor and interests&quot; of the People&#x27;s Republic and encouraging the promotion of &quot;socialist core values&quot;, approved by the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee.

==Beginnings==
Motion pictures were introduced to China in 1896. They were introduced through foreign film exhibitors in treaty ports like Shanghai and Hong Kong.

China was one of the earliest countries to be exposed to the medium of film, due to Louis Lumière sending his cameraman to Shanghai a year after inventing cinematography. The first recorded screening of a motion picture in China took place in Shanghai on 11 August 1896 as an &quot;act&quot; on a variety bill. The first Chinese film, a recording of the Peking opera, &quot;Dingjun Mountain&quot;, was made in November 1905 in Beijing. For the next decade the production companies were mainly foreign-owned, and the domestic film industry was centered on Shanghai, a thriving entrepot and the largest city in the Far East.

Chinese-made short melodrama and comedy films began emerging in 1913. In 1913, the first independent Chinese screenplay, &quot;The Difficult Couple&quot;, was filmed in Shanghai by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan. Zhang Shichuan then set up the first Chinese-owned film production company in 1916. The first full-length feature film was &quot;Yan Ruisheng&quot; (閻瑞生) released in 1921, which was a docudrama about the killing of a Shanghai courtesan.

Chinese film production developed significantly in the 1920s. During the 1920s film technicians from the United States trained Chinese technicians in Shanghai, and American influence continued to be felt there for the next two decades. Since film was still in its earliest stages of development, most Chinese silent films at this time were only comic skits or operatic shorts, and training was minimal at a technical aspect due to this being a period of experimental film. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, filmmaking in China was largely done by film studios and there was comparatively little small scale filmmaking.

Upscale movie theaters in China had contracts which required them to exclusively show Hollywood films, and thus as of the later 1920s, Hollywood films accounted for 90% of screen time in Chinese theaters.

After trial and error, China was able to draw inspiration from its own traditional values and began producing martial arts films, with the first being &quot;Burning of Red Lotus Temple&quot; (1928). &quot;Burning of Red Lotus Temple&quot; was so successful at the box office, the Star Motion Pictures (Mingxing) production later filmed 18 sequels, marking the beginning of China&#x27;s esteemed martial arts films. Many imitators followed, including U. Lien (Youlian) Studio&#x27;s &quot;Red Heroine&quot; (1929), which is still extant. It was during this period that some of the more important production companies first came into being, notably Mingxing and the Shaw brothers&#x27; Tianyi (&quot;Unique&quot;). Mingxing, founded by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan in 1922, initially focused on comic shorts, including the oldest surviving complete Chinese film, &quot;Laborer&#x27;s Love&quot; (1922). This soon shifted, however, to feature-length films and family dramas including &quot;Orphan Rescues Grandfather&quot; (1923). Meanwhile, Tianyi shifted their model towards folklore dramas and also pushed into foreign markets; their film &quot;White Snake&quot; (1926) proved a typical example of their success in the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia. In 1931, the first Chinese sound film &quot;Sing-Song Girl Red Peony&quot; was made, the product of a cooperation between the Mingxing Film Company&#x27;s image production and Pathé Frères&#x27;s sound technology. However, the sound was disc-recorded, which was then played in the theater in-sync with the action on the screen. The first sound-on-film talkie made in China was either &quot;Spring on Stage&quot; (歌場春色) by Tianyi, or &quot;Clear Sky After Storm&quot; by Great China Studio and Jinan Studio. Musical films, such as &quot;Song at Midnight&quot; (1937) and &quot;Street Angels&quot; (1937), starring Zhou Xuan, became one of the most popular film genres in China.

News films increased in importance following the Japanese air raid on Shanghai in 1932. The bombing also destroyed significant amounts of the Chinese film industry and resulted in the loss of many early films.

===Leftist movement===
The first truly important Chinese films were produced beginning in the 1930s with the advent of the &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;left-wing&quot; movement, like Cheng Bugao&#x27;s &quot;Spring Silkworms&quot; (1933), Wu Yonggang&#x27;s &quot;The Goddess&quot; (1934), and Sun Yu&#x27;s &quot;The Great Road&quot;, also known as &quot;The Big Road&quot; (1934). These films were noted for their emphasis on class struggle and external threats (i.e. Japanese aggression), as well as on their focus on common people, such as a family of silk farmers in &quot;Spring Silkworms&quot; and a prostitute in &quot;The Goddess&quot;. In part due to the success of these kinds of films, this post-1930 era is now often referred to as the first &quot;golden period&quot; of Chinese cinema. The Leftist cinematic movement often revolved around the Western-influenced Shanghai, where filmmakers portrayed the struggling lower class of an overpopulated city.

Three production companies dominated the market in the early to mid-1930s: the newly formed Lianhua (&quot;United China&quot;), the older and larger Mingxing and Tianyi. Both Mingxing and Lianhua leaned left (Lianhua&#x27;s management perhaps more so), while Tianyi continued to make less socially conscious fare.

The period also produced the first big Chinese movie stars, such as Hu Die, Ruan Lingyu, Li Lili, Chen Yanyan, Zhou Xuan, Zhao Dan and Jin Yan. Other major films of the period include &quot;Love and Duty&quot; (1931), &quot;Little Toys&quot; (1933), &quot;New Women&quot; (1934), &quot;Song of the Fishermen&quot; (1934), &quot;Plunder of Peach and Plum&quot; (1934), &quot;Crossroads&quot; (1937), and &quot;Street Angel&quot; (1937). Throughout the 1930s, the Nationalists and the Communists struggled for power and control over the major studios; their influence can be seen in the films the studios produced during this period.

===Japanese occupation and World War II===

The Japanese invasion of China in 1937, in particular the Battle of Shanghai, ended this golden run in Chinese cinema. All production companies except Xinhua Film Company (&quot;New China&quot;) closed shop. A large number filmmakers left to join the War of Resistance, with many going to the Nationalist-controlled hinterlands to join the Nationalist film studios Central Motion Picture Studio or China Motion Picture Studio. A smaller number went to Yan&#x27;an or Hong Kong.

The Shanghai film industry, though severely curtailed, did not stop however, thus leading to the &quot;Solitary Island&quot; period (also known as the &quot;Sole Island&quot; or &quot;Orphan Island&quot;), with Shanghai&#x27;s foreign concessions serving as an &quot;island&quot; of production in the &quot;sea&quot; of Japanese-occupied territory. It was during this period that artists and directors who remained in the city had to walk a fine line between staying true to their leftist and nationalist beliefs and Japanese pressures. Director Bu Wancang&#x27;s &quot;Hua Mu Lan&quot;, also known as &quot;Mulan Joins the Army&quot; (1939), with its story of a young Chinese peasant fighting against a foreign invasion, was a particularly good example of Shanghai&#x27;s continued film-production in the midst of war. This period ended when Japan declared war on the Western allies on 7 December 1941; the solitary island was finally engulfed by the sea of the Japanese occupation. With the Shanghai industry firmly in Japanese control, films like the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere-promoting &quot;Eternity&quot; (1943) were produced.

During the 1930 and 1940s, both the Chinese Nationalist government and the Japanese occupation authorities sent mobile projectionist units into areas under their control to show propaganda films.

In the Yan&#x27;an Soviet during September 1938, the Eighth Route Army established its first film group. In 1943, the communists released their first campaign film, &quot;Nanniwan&quot;, which sought to develop relationships between the communist army and local people in the Yan&#x27;an area by showcasing the army&#x27;s production campaign to alleviate material shortages.

Following Japan&#x27;s unconditional surrender in August 1945, the Soviet Red Army helped the Chinese communists to take over the Japanese colonial film establishment in Manchuria, the Manchukuo Film Association (Man-ei). Man-ei had state-of-the-art film production equipment and supplies. The former colonial studio was relocated to Hegang, where it was established as Northeastern Film Studio, the communist party&#x27;s first full-capacity film studio. Yuan Muzhi was its director and Chen Bo&#x27;er was its party secretary. Northeastern Film Studio began production in early 1947, focusing on news and documentary films, as well as some fiction, educational film for children, and animation.

During the later phase of the Chinese Civil War, filmmakers trained in Yan&#x27;an and Northeastern Film Studio documented all the major battles leading to the communists&#x27; defeat of the Nationalists.

==Second golden age==
The film industry continued to develop after 1945. Production in Shanghai once again resumed as a new crop of studios took the place that Lianhua and Mingxing studios had occupied in the previous decade. In 1945, Cai Chusheng returned to Shanghai to revive the Lianhua name as the &quot;Lianhua Film Society with Shi Dongshan, Meng Junmou, and Zheng Junli.&quot; This in turn became Kunlun Studios, which would go on to become one of the most important studios of the era (Kunlun Studios merged with seven other studios to form Shanghai film studio in 1949), putting out the classics &quot;The Spring River Flows East&quot; (1947), &quot;Myriad of Lights&quot; (1948), &quot;Crows and Sparrows&quot; (1949), and &quot;Wanderings of Three-Hairs the Orphan&quot;, also known as &quot;San Mao, The Little Vagabond&quot; (1949).
Many of these films showed the disillusionment with the oppressive rule of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist Party and the struggling oppression of nation by war. &quot;The Spring River Flows East&quot;, a three-hour-long two-parter directed by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, was a particularly strong success. Its depiction of the struggles of ordinary Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese war, replete with biting social and political commentary, struck a chord with audiences of the time.

Meanwhile, companies like the Wenhua Film Company (&quot;Culture Films&quot;), moved away from the leftist tradition and explored the evolution and development of other dramatic genres. Wenhua treated postwar problems in universalistic and humanistic ways, avoiding the family narrative and melodramatic formulae. Excellent examples of Wenhua&#x27;s fare are its first two postwar features, &quot;Love Everlasting&quot; (&quot;Bu liaoqing&quot;, 1947) and &quot;Fake Bride, Phony Bridegroom&quot; (1947). Another memorable Wenhua film is &quot;Long Live the Missus&quot; (1947), like &quot;Love Everlasting&quot; with an original screenplay by writer Eileen Chang. Wenhua&#x27;s romantic drama, &quot;Spring in a Small Town&quot; (1948), directed by Fei Mu shortly prior to the revolution, is often regarded by Chinese film critics as one of the most important films in the history of Chinese cinema, in 2005, Hong Kong film awards it as the best 100 years of film. Ironically, it was precisely its artistic quality and apparent lack of &quot;political grounding&quot; that led to its labeling by the Communists as rightist or reactionary, and the film was quickly forgotten by those on the mainland following the Communist victory in China in 1949. However, with the China Film Archive&#x27;s re-opening after the Cultural Revolution, a new print was struck from the original negative, allowing &quot;Spring of the Small Town&quot; to find a new and admiring audience and to influence an entire new generation of filmmakers. Indeed, an acclaimed remake was made in 2002 by Tian Zhuangzhuang. A Chinese Peking opera film, &quot;A Wedding in the Dream&quot; (1948), by the same director (Fei Mu), was the first Chinese color film.

==Early Communist era==

At the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, there were fewer than 600 movie theaters in the country. The government saw motion pictures as an important artform and tool for mass propaganda. The Soviet-led collaborations &quot;Victory of the Chinese People&quot; (1950) and &quot;Liberated China&quot; (1951) were among the biggest film events in the PRC&#x27;s early years. &quot;Victory of the Chinese People&quot; depicted re-enactments of four of the communist party&#x27;s major military victories and was filmed using real ammunition with the participation of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

The private studios in Shanghai, including Kunming, Wenhua, Guotai, and Datong, were at first encouraged to make new films. They made approximately 47 films during the next two years but soon ran into trouble, owing to the furor over the Kunlun-produced drama &quot;The Life of Wu Xun&quot; (1950), directed by Sun Yu and starring veteran Zhao Dan. In an anonymous article in &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; in May 1951, the feature was accused of spreading feudal ideas. After the article was revealed to be penned by Mao Zedong, the film was banned, the Film Steering Committee was formed to &quot;re-educate&quot; the film industry, and the private studios were all incorporated into the state-run Shanghai Film Studio.

After the establishment of the PRC, China&#x27;s cultural bureaucracy described American films as screen-opium and began criticizing American film alongside anti-drug campaigns. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sought to tighten control over mass media, producing instead movies centering on peasants, soldiers, and workers, such as &quot;Bridge&quot; (1949) and &quot;The White-Haired Girl&quot; (1950). One of the production bases in the middle of all the transition was the Changchun Film Studio. American films were banned as part of the Korean War effort.

The Communist government solved the problem of a lack of film theaters by building mobile projection units which could tour the remote regions of China, ensuring that even the poorest could have access to films. The vast majority of China&#x27;s people lived in rural areas, and most people in China had not seen a film until mobile projectionists brought them. Mobile projection teams during the Mao era typically included three to four workers who physically transported film infrastructure through a large geographic area mostly not covered by any electrical grid. Yuan Muzhi was important in developing the Communist government&#x27;s theories and practices of rural film exhibition. Yuan and Chen Bo&#x27;er transformed the post-Second Sino-Japanese War remnants of the Manchurian Motion Picture Association into the Northeast Film Studio and when Yuan became Film Bureau chief in 1949, he applied its model to help institute a film exhibition network around the country. The Northeast Film Studio also trained the first generation of communist Chinese documentary filmmakers.

In 1950, 1,800 projectionists from around the country traveled to Nanjing for a training program. These projectionists replicated the training program in their own home provinces to create more projectionists. Nanjing was later termed a &quot;Cradle of People&#x27;s Cinema.&quot; The PRC sought to recruit women and ethnic minority projectionists in an effort to more effectively reach marginalized communities.

Until the profusion of mobile projectionist teams in the 1950s, most rural people had not seen a film. The number of movie-viewers hence increased sharply, partly bolstered by the fact that film tickets were given out to work units and attendance was compulsory, with admissions rising from 47 million in 1949 to 4.15 billion in 1959. By 1965 there were around 20,393 mobile film units. During the course of the Mao era, the majority of films were shown by such units, with only a minority watched in theaters.

Work as a mobile projectionist was physically and technically demanding. As a result, women projectionists and all-women mobile projection teams were promoted in Chinese media as examples of advancing gender equality under socialism.

In the 1950s and the 1960s, the Communist Party built cinemas (among other cultural buildings) in industrial districts on urban peripheries. These structures were influenced by Soviet architecture and were intended to be vivacious but not &quot;palatial.&quot;

Rural mobile projectionist teams and urban movie theaters were generally managed through the PRC&#x27;s cultural bureaucracy. Trade Unions and PLA propaganda departments also operated film exhibition networks.

In 1950s China, a common view of film was that it served as &quot;socialist distance horizon education&quot;. For example, films promoted rural collectivization. Cinema also sought to develop the proletarian class consciousness of rural workers, encouraging the industrialization and militarization of their labor. Film projection teams operating in rural China were asked to incorporate lantern slides into their work to introduce national policies and political campaigns.

In the 17 years between the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Cultural Revolution, 603 feature films and 8,342 reels of documentaries and newsreels were produced, sponsored mostly as Communist propaganda by the government. For example, in &quot;Guerrilla on the Railroad&quot; (铁道游击队), dated 1956, the Chinese Communist Party was depicted as the primary resistance force against the Second Sino-Japanese War. Chinese filmmakers were sent to Moscow to study the Soviet socialist realism style of filmmaking. The Beijing Film Academy was established in 1950 and officially opened in 1956. One important film of this era is &quot;This Life of Mine&quot; (1950), directed by Shi Hu, which follows an old beggar reflecting on his past life as a policeman working for the various regimes since 1911. The first widescreen Chinese film was produced in 1960. Animated films using a variety of folk arts, such as papercuts, shadow plays, puppetry, and traditional paintings, also were very popular for entertaining and educating children. The most famous of these, the classic &quot;Havoc in Heaven&quot; (two parts, 1961, 4), was made by Wan Laiming of the Wan Brothers and won the Outstanding Film award at the London International Film Festival.

Films such as &quot;The White-Haired Girl&quot; and &quot;Serf&quot; were part of a genre of redemptive melodramas, which sought to encourage audiences to &quot;speak bitterness&quot;.

After the United Kingdom and the PRC established diplomatic relations, cultural exchanges between the two countries gradually resumed, including British moves being made available in China.

The thawing of censorship in 1956–57 (known as the Hundred Flowers Campaign) and in the early 1960s led to more indigenous Chinese films being made, which were less reliant on their Soviet counterparts. During this campaign the sharpest criticisms came from the satirical comedies of Lü Ban. &quot;Before the New Director Arrives&quot; exposes the hierarchical relationships occurring between the cadres, while his next film, &quot;The Unfinished Comedy&quot; (1957), was labeled as a &quot;poisonous weed&quot; during the Anti-Rightist Movement, and Lü was banned from directing for life. Other noteworthy films produced during this period were adaptations of literary classics, such as Sang Hu&#x27;s &quot;The New Year&#x27;s Sacrifice&quot; (1956, adapted from a Lu Xun story) and Shui Hua&#x27;s &quot;The Lin Family Shop&quot; (1959, adapted from a Mao Dun story). The most prominent filmmaker of this era was Xie Jin, whose three films in particular, &quot;Woman Basketball Player No. 5&quot; (1957), &quot;The Red Detachment of Women&quot; (1961), and &quot;Two Stage Sisters&quot; (1964), exemplify China&#x27;s increased expertise in filmmaking. Films made during this period are polished, exhibiting high production value and elaborate sets. While Beijing and Shanghai remained the main centers of production, between 1957 and 1960 the government built regional studios in Guangzhou, Xi&#x27;an, and Chengdu to encourage representation of ethnic minorities in films. Chinese cinema began to directly address the issue of such ethnic minorities during the late 1950s and early 1960s in films like &quot;Five Golden Flowers&quot; (1959), &quot;Third Sister Liu&quot; (1960), &quot;Serfs&quot; (1963), and &quot;Ashima&quot; (1964).

On 9 March 1958, the Ministry of Culture held a meeting to introduce a Great Leap Forward in cinema. During the Great Leap Forward, the film industry rapidly expanded, with documentary films being the genre that experienced the greatest growth. Trends in documentary film included &quot;artistic documentaries,&quot; in which actors and non-actors reenacted events. Film venues also expanded rapidly, including both urban cinemas and mobile projection units.

As part of the Socialist Education Movement, mobile film projectionist units showed films and slideshows that emphasized class struggle and encouraged audience members to discuss bitter experiences onstage. New films termed &quot;emphasis films&quot; were released to coincide with the campaign, and the film version of &quot;The White-Haired Girl&quot; was re-released.

In 1965, China launched the Resist America, Aid Vietnam campaign in response to the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam. To promote campaign themes denouncing U.S. imperialism and promoted Vietnamese resistance, the communist party used film exhibitions and other cultural media.

==Films of the Cultural Revolution==
During the Cultural Revolution, the film industry was severely restricted. Almost all previous films were banned, and only a few new ones were produced, the revolutionary model operas. The most notable of these was a ballet version of the revolutionary opera &quot;The Red Detachment of Women&quot;, directed by Pan Wenzhan and Fu Jie in 1970.

The release of filmed versions of the revolutionary model operas resulted in a re-organization and expansion of China&#x27;s film exhibition network. From 1965 to 1976, the number of film projection units in China quadrupled, total film audiences nearly tripled, and the national film attendance rate doubled. The Cultural Revolution Group drastically reduced ticket prices which, in its view, would allow film to better serve the needs of workers and of socialism.

In addition to films deemed laudatory, from the middle of 1966 to 1968, the expanding film distribution network screened films characterized as &quot;poisonous weeds&quot; to hundreds of millions of audience members for the purpose of criticizing the films. These criticism screenings were sometimes accompanied by struggle sessions.

Sent-down youth were a major subset of China&#x27;s rural projectionists during the Cultural Revolution period.

Feature film production came almost to a standstill in the early years from 1967 to 1972. Movie production revived after 1972 under the strict jurisdiction of the Gang of Four until 1976, when they were overthrown. The few films that were produced during this period, such as 1975&#x27;s &quot;Breaking with Old Ideas&quot;, were highly regulated in terms of plot and characterization.

In 1972, Chinese officials invited Michelangelo Antonioni to China to film the achievements of the Cultural Revolution. Antonioni made the documentary &quot;Chung Kuo, Cina&quot;. When it was released in 1974, Communist Party leadership in China interpreted the film as reactionary and anti-Chinese. Viewing art through the principles of the Yan&#x27;an Talks, particularly the concept that there is no such thing as art-for-art&#x27;s-sake, party leadership construed Antonioni&#x27;s aesthetic choices as politically motivated and banned the film. Jiang Qing criticized Premier Zhou Enlai&#x27;s role in Antonioni&#x27;s invitation to China as not only a failure but also treasonous. Since its 2004 release in China, the film has been well-regarded by Chinese audiences, especially for its beautiful depictions of a more simple time.

Because China rejection most foreign film importation, comparatively minor cinema like Albanian cinema and North Korean cinema developed mass audiences in China. Through Albanian films screened during this period, many Chinese audience members were introduced to avant-garde and modernist storytelling techniques and aesthetics.

==Post-Cultural Revolution==
===Box office boom after the Cultural Revolution===
In the years immediately following the Cultural Revolution, the film industry again flourished as a medium of popular entertainment. Production rose steadily, from 19 features in 1977 to 125 in 1986. Domestically produced films played to large audiences, and tickets for foreign film festivals sold quickly. The industry tried to revive crowds by making more innovative and &quot;exploratory&quot; films like their counterparts in the West.

Chinese cinema grew significantly in the late 1970s. In 1979, annual box office admissions reached a peak of tickets sold, equivalent to an average of per person. Chinese cinema continued to prosper into the early 1980s. In 1980, annual box office admissions stood at tickets sold, equivalent to an average of per person. In terms of box office admissions, this period represented the peak ticket sales in the history of the Chinese box office. High ticket sales were driven by low ticket prices, with a cinema ticket typically costing between ¥0.1 () and ¥0.3 () at the time.

By the early 1980s, there were 162,000 projection units in China, primarily composed of mobile movie teams which showed films outdoors in both rural and urban areas.

A number of films during this period drew box office admissions in the hundreds of millions. China&#x27;s highest-grossing film in box office admissions was &quot;Legend of the White Snake&quot; (1980) with an estimated admissions, followed by (1981) and &quot;The Undaunted Wudang&quot; (1983) with more than ticket sales each. The highest-grossing foreign film was the Japanese film &quot;Kimi yo Fundo no Kawa o Watare&quot; (1976), which released in 1978 and sold more than tickets, followed by the Indian film &quot;Caravan&quot; (1971) which released in 1979 and sold about tickets.

In the late 1980s the film industry fell on hard times, faced with the dual problems of competition from other forms of entertainment and concern on the part of the authorities that many of the popular thriller and martial arts films were socially unacceptable. In January 1986 the film industry was transferred from the Ministry of Culture to the newly formed Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television to bring it under &quot;stricter control and management&quot; and to &quot;strengthen supervision over production.&quot;

===&quot;Scar dramas&quot;===

The end of the Cultural Revolution brought the release of &quot;scar dramas&quot; (傷痕剧 &quot;shānghén jù&quot;), which depicted the emotional traumas left by this period. The best-known of these is probably Xie Jin&#x27;s &quot;Hibiscus Town&quot; (1986), although they could be seen as late as the 1990s with Tian Zhuangzhuang&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Kite&quot; (1993). In the 1980s, open criticism of certain past Communist Party policies was encouraged by Deng Xiaoping as a way to reveal the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and the earlier Anti-Rightist Campaign, also helping to legitimize Deng&#x27;s new policies of &quot;reform and opening up.&quot; For instance, the Best Picture prize in the inaugural 1981 Golden Rooster Awards was given to two &quot;scar dramas&quot;, &quot;Evening Rain&quot; (Wu Yonggang, Wu Yigong, 1980) and &quot;Legend of Tianyun Mountain&quot; (Xie Jin, 1980).

Many scar dramas were made by members of the Fourth Generation whose own careers or lives had suffered during the events in question, while younger, Fifth Generation directors such as Tian tended to focus on less controversial subjects of the immediate present or the distant past. Official enthusiasm for scar dramas waned by the 1990s when younger filmmakers began to confront negative aspects of the Mao era. &quot;The Blue Kite&quot;, though sharing a similar subject as the earlier scar dramas, was more realistic in style, and was made only through obfuscating its real script. Shown abroad, it was banned from release in mainland China, while Tian himself was banned from making any films for nearly a decade afterward. After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, few if any scar dramas were released domestically in mainland China.

==Rise of the fifth generation==
Beginning in the mid-late 1980s during the New Enlightenment movement in China, the rise of the so-called fifth generation of Chinese filmmakers brought increased popularity of Chinese cinema abroad. Most of the filmmakers who made up the Fifth Generation had graduated from the Beijing Film Academy in 1982 and included Zhang Yimou, Tian Zhuangzhuang, Chen Kaige, Zhang Junzhao, Li Shaohong, Wu Ziniu and others. These graduates constituted the first group of filmmakers to graduate since the Cultural Revolution and they soon jettisoned traditional methods of storytelling and opted for a more free and unorthodox symbolic approach. After the so-called scar literature in fiction had paved the way for frank discussion, Zhang Junzhao&#x27;s &quot;One and Eight&quot; (1983) and Chen Kaige&#x27;s &quot;Yellow Earth&quot; (1984) in particular were taken to mark the beginnings of the Fifth Generation. &quot;Yellow Earth&quot; became one of the first Chinese art films to attract international attention.

The most famous of the Fifth Generation directors, Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, went on to produce celebrated works such as &quot;King of the Children&quot; (1987), &quot;Ju Dou&quot; (1989), &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; (1991) and &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; (1993), which were not only acclaimed by Chinese cinema-goers but by the Western arthouse audience. Tian Zhuangzhuang&#x27;s films, though less well known by Western viewers, were well noted by directors such as Martin Scorsese. It was during this period that Chinese cinema began reaping the rewards of international attention, including the 1988 Golden Bear for &quot;Red Sorghum&quot;, the 1992 Golden Lion for &quot;The Story of Qiu Ju&quot;, the 1993 Palme d&#x27;Or for &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;, and three Best Foreign Language Film nominations from the Academy Awards. All these award-winning films starred actress Gong Li, who became the Fifth Generation&#x27;s most recognizable star, especially to international audiences.

Diverse in style and subject, the Fifth Generation directors&#x27; films ranged from black comedy (Huang Jianxin&#x27;s &quot;The Black Cannon Incident&quot;, 1985) to the esoteric (Chen Kaige&#x27;s &quot;Life on a String&quot;, 1991), but they share a common rejection of the socialist-realist tradition worked by earlier Chinese filmmakers in the Communist era. Other notable Fifth Generation directors include Wu Ziniu, Hu Mei, Li Shaohong and Zhou Xiaowen. Fifth Generation filmmakers reacted against the ideological purity of Cultural Revolution cinema. By relocating to regional studios, they began to explore the actuality of local culture in a somewhat documentarian fashion. Instead of stories depicting heroic military struggles, the films were built out of the drama of ordinary people&#x27;s daily lives. They also retained political edge, but aimed at exploring issues rather than recycling approved policy. While Cultural Revolution films used character, the younger directors favored psychological depth along the lines of European cinema. They adopted complex plots, ambiguous symbolism, and evocative imagery. Some of their bolder works with political overtones were banned by Chinese authorities.

These films came with a creative genres of stories, new style of shooting as well, directors utilized extensive color and long shots to present and explore history and structure of national culture. As a result of the new films being so intricate, the films were for more educated audiences than anything. The new style was profitable for some and helped filmmakers to make strides in the business. It allowed directors to get away from reality and show their artistic sense.

The Fourth Generation also returned to prominence. Given their label after the rise of the Fifth Generation, these were directors whose careers were stalled by the Cultural Revolution and who were professionally trained prior to 1966. Wu Tianming, in particular, made outstanding contributions by helping to finance major Fifth Generation directors under the auspices of the Xi&#x27;an Film Studio (which he took over in 1983), while continuing to make films like &quot;Old Well&quot; (1986) and &quot;The King of Masks&quot; (1996).

The Fifth Generation movement ended in part after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, although its major directors continued to produce notable works. Several of its filmmakers went into self-imposed exile: Wu Tianming moved to the United States (but later returned), Huang Jianxin left for Australia, while many others went into television-related works.

==Main melody dramas==
During a period when socialist dramas were beginning to lose viewership, the Chinese government began to involve itself deeper into the world of popular culture and cinema by creating the official genre of the &quot;main melody&quot; (主旋律 &quot;zhǔxuánlǜ&quot;), inspired by Hollywood&#x27;s strides in musical dramas. In 1987, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television issued a statement encouraging the making of movies which emphasizes the main melody to &quot;invigorate national spirit and national pride&quot;. The expression &quot;main melody&quot; refers to the musical term &quot;leitmotif&quot;, which translates to the &#x27;theme of our times&#x27;, which scholars suggest is representative of China&#x27;s socio-political climate and cultural context of popular cinema. These main melody films, still produced regularly in modern times, try to emulate the commercial mainstream by the use of Hollywood-style music and special effects. A significant feature of these films is the incorporation of a &quot;red song&quot;, which is a song written as propaganda to support the People&#x27;s Republic of China. By revolving the film around the motif of a red song, the film is able to gain traction at the box office as songs are generally thought to be more accessible than a film. Theoretically, once the red song dominates the charts, it will stir interest in the film that which it accompanies.

Main melody dramas are often subsidized by the state and have free access to government and military personnel. The Chinese government spends between &quot;one and two million RMBs&quot; annually to support the production of films in the main melody genre. August First Film Studio, the film and TV production arm of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, is a studio that produces main melody cinema. Main melody films, which often depict past military engagements or are biopics of first-generation CCP leaders, have won several Best Picture prizes at the Golden Rooster Awards. Some of the more famous main melody dramas include the ten-hour epic &quot;Decisive Engagement&quot; (大决战, 1991), directed by Cai Jiawei, Yang Guangyuan and Wei Lian; &quot;The Opium War&quot; (1997), directed by Xie Jin; and &quot;The Founding of a Republic&quot; (2009), directed by Han Sanping and Fifth Generation director Huang Jianxin. &quot;The Founding of an Army&quot; (2017) was commissioned by the government to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, and is the third instalment in The Founding of a Republic series. The film featured many young Chinese pop singers that are already well-established in the industry, including Li Yifeng, Liu Haoran, and Lay Zhang, so as to further the film&#x27;s reputation as a main melody drama.

==The sixth generation==

The post-1990 era has been labeled the &quot;return of the amateur filmmaker&quot; as state censorship policies after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests produced an edgy underground film movement loosely referred to as the Sixth Generation. Owing to the lack of state funding and backing, these films were shot quickly and cheaply, using materials like 16 mm film and digital video and mostly non-professional actors and actresses, producing a documentary feel, often with long takes, hand-held cameras, and ambient sound; more akin to Italian neorealism and cinéma vérité than the often lush, far more considered productions of the Fifth Generation. Unlike the Fifth Generation, the Sixth Generation brings a more individualistic, anti-romantic life-view and pays far closer attention to contemporary urban life, especially as affected by disorientation, rebellion and dissatisfaction with China&#x27;s contemporary social marketing economic tensions and comprehensive cultural background. Many were made with an extremely low budget (an example is Jia Zhangke, who shoots on digital video, and formerly on 16 mm; Wang Xiaoshuai&#x27;s &quot;The Days&quot; (1993) was made for US$10,000). The title and subjects of many of these films reflect the Sixth Generation&#x27;s concerns. The Sixth Generation takes an interest in marginalized individuals and the less represented fringes of society. For example, Zhang Yuan&#x27;s hand-held &quot;Beijing Bastards&quot; (1993) focuses on youth punk subculture, featuring artists like Cui Jian, Dou Wei and He Yong frowned upon by many state authorities, while Jia Zhangke&#x27;s debut film &quot;Xiao Wu&quot; (1997) concerns a provincial pickpocket. While many Fifth Generation filmmakers have become darlings of mainstream Chinese culture, Sixth Generation filmmakers have often experienced harsh treatment by the state&#x27;s censorship and regulatory system, despite their success at international film festivals and arthouse markets.

As the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent movies were joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget. Jia&#x27;s &quot;Platform&quot; (2000) was funded in part by Takeshi Kitano&#x27;s production house, while his &quot;Still Life&quot; was shot on HD video. &quot;Still Life&quot; was a surprise addition and Golden Lion winner of the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. &quot;Still Life&quot;, which concerns provincial workers around the Three Gorges region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth Generation Chinese directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige who were at the time producing &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Promise&quot; (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals.

Many Sixth Generation films have highlighted the negative attributes of China&#x27;s entry into the modern capitalist market. Li Yang&#x27;s &quot;Blind Shaft&quot; (2003) for example, is an account of two murderous con-men in the unregulated and notoriously dangerous mining industry of northern China. (Li refused the tag of Sixth Generation, although admitted he was not Fifth Generation). While Jia Zhangke&#x27;s &quot;The World&quot; (2004) emphasizes the emptiness of globalization in the backdrop of an internationally themed amusement park.

Some of the more prolific Sixth Generation directors to have emerged are Wang Xiaoshuai (&quot;The Days&quot;, &quot;Beijing Bicycle&quot;, &quot;So Long, My Son&quot;), Zhang Yuan (&quot;Beijing Bastards&quot;, &quot;East Palace West Palace&quot;), Jia Zhangke (&quot;Xiao Wu&quot;, &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;, &quot;Platform&quot;, &quot;The World&quot;, &quot;A Touch of Sin&quot;, &quot;Mountains May Depart&quot;, &quot;Ash Is Purest White&quot;), He Jianjun (&quot;Postman&quot;) and Lou Ye (&quot;Suzhou River&quot;, &quot;Summer Palace&quot;). One director of their generation who does not share most of the concerns of the Sixth Generation is Lu Chuan (&quot;&quot;, 2004; &quot;City of Life and Death&quot;, 2010).

=== Notable Sixth Generation directors ===
In the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, two of China&#x27;s Sixth generation filmmakers, Jia Zhangke and Zhang Ming – whose grim works transformed Chinese cinema in the 1990s – showed on the French Riviera. While both directors represent Chinese cinema, their profiles are quite different. The 49-year-old Jia set up the Pingyao International Film Festival in 2017 and on the other hand is Zhang, a 56-year-old film school professor who spent years working on government commissions and domestic TV shows after struggling with his own projects. Despite their different profiles, they mark an important cornerstone in Chinese cinema and are both credited with bringing Chinese movies to the international big screen. Chinese director Jia Zhangke&#x27;s latest film &quot;Ash Is Purest White&quot; has been selected to compete in the official competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or of the 71st Cannes Film Festival, the highest prize awarded at the film festival. It is Jia&#x27;s fifth movie, a gangster revenge drama that is his most expensive and mainstream film to date. Back in 2013, Jia won Best Screenplay Award for &quot;A Touch of Sin&quot;, following nominations for &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; in 2002 and &quot;24 City&quot; in 2008. In 2014, he was a member of the official jury and the following year his film &quot;Mountains May Depart&quot; was nominated. According to entertainment website Variety, a record number of Chinese films were submitted this year but only Jia&#x27;s romantic drama was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or. Meanwhile, Zhang will make his debut at Cannes with &quot;The Pluto Moment&quot;, a slow-moving relationship drama about a team of filmmakers scouting for locations and musical talent in China&#x27;s rural hinterland. The film is Zhang&#x27;s highest profile production so far, as it stars actor Wang Xuebing in the leading role. The film was partly financed by iQiyi, the company behind one of China&#x27;s most popular online video browsing sharing sites. Diao Yinan is also a notable member of the sixth generation whose works include &quot;Black Coal Thin Ice&quot;, &quot;Wild Goose Lake&quot;, &quot;Night Train&quot; and &quot;Uniform&quot; which have premiered at festivals such as Cannes and received acclaim abroad.

==Other directors==
He Ping is a director of mostly Western-like films set in Chinese locale. His &quot;Swordsmen in Double Flag Town&quot; (1991) and &quot;Sun Valley&quot; (1995) explore narratives set in the sparse terrain of West China near the Gobi Desert. His historical drama &quot;Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker&quot; (1994) won a myriad of prizes home and abroad.

Recent cinema has seen Chinese cinematographers direct some acclaimed films. Other than Zhang Yimou, Lü Yue made &quot;Mr. Zhao&quot; (1998), a black comedy film well received abroad. Gu Changwei&#x27;s minimalist epic &quot;Peacock&quot; (2005), about a quiet, ordinary Chinese family with three very different siblings in the post-Cultural Revolution era, took home the Silver Bear prize for 2005 Berlin International Film Festival. Hou Yong is another cinematographer who made films (&quot;Jasmine Women&quot;, 2004) and TV series. There are actors who straddle the dual roles of acting and directing. Xu Jinglei, a popular Chinese actress, has made six movies to date. Her second film &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; (2004) landed her the San Sebastián International Film Festival Best Director award. Another popular actress and director is Zhao Wei, whose directorial debut &quot;So Young&quot; (2013) was a huge box office and critical success.

The most highly regarded Chinese actor-director is undoubtedly Jiang Wen, who has directed several critically acclaimed movies while following on his acting career. His directorial debut, &quot;In the Heat of the Sun&quot; (1994) was the first PRC film to win Best Picture at the Golden Horse Film Awards held in Taiwan. His other films, like &quot;Devils on the Doorstep&quot; (2000, Cannes Grand Prix) and &quot;Let the Bullets Fly&quot; (2010), were similarly well received. By the early 2011, &quot;Let the Bullets Fly&quot; had become the highest grossing domestic film in China&#x27;s history.

==Generation-independent movement==

There is a growing number of independent seventh or post-Sixth Generation filmmakers making films with extremely low budgets and using digital equipment. They are the so-called dGeneration (for digital). These films, like those from Sixth Generation filmmakers, are mostly made outside the Chinese film system and are shown mostly on the international film festival circuit. Ying Liang and Jian Yi are two of these generation filmmakers. Ying&#x27;s &quot;Taking Father Home&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Other Half&quot; (2006) are both representative of the generation trends of the feature film. Liu Jiayin made two dGeneration feature films, &quot;Oxhide&quot; (2004) and &quot;Oxhide II&quot; (2010), blurring the line between documentary and narrative film. &quot;Oxhide&quot;, made by Liu when she was a film student, frames herself and her parents in their claustrophobic Beijing apartment in a narrative praised by critics. &quot;An Elephant Sitting Still&quot;, considered one of the greatest film debuts in Chinese cinema, is also the only film by the late Hu Bo.

==New documentary movement==
Two decades of reform and commercialization have brought dramatic social changes in mainland China, reflected not only in fiction film but in a growing documentary movement. Wu Wenguang&#x27;s 70-minute &quot;Bumming in Beijing: The Last Dreamers&quot; (1990) is now seen as one of the first works of this &quot;New Documentary Movement&quot; (NDM) in China. &quot;Bumming&quot;, made between 1988 and 1990, contains interviews with five young artists eking out a living in Beijing, subject to state authorized tasks. Shot using a camcorder, the documentary ends with four of the artists moving abroad after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. &quot;Dance with the Farm Workers&quot; (2001) is another documentary by Wu.

Another internationally acclaimed documentary is Wang Bing&#x27;s nine-hour tale of deindustrialization &quot;Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks&quot; (2003). Wang&#x27;s subsequent documentaries, &quot;&quot; (2007), &quot;Crude Oil&quot; (2008), &quot;Man with no name&quot; (2009), &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (2012) and &quot;Feng ai&quot; (2013), cemented his reputation as a leading documentarist of the movement.

Li Hong, the first woman in the NDM, in &quot;Out of Phoenix Bridge&quot; (1997) relates the story of four young women, who moving from rural areas to the big cities like millions of other men and women, have come to Beijing to make a living.

The New Documentary Movement in recent times has overlapped with the dGeneration filmmaking, with most documentaries being shot cheaply and independently in the digital format. Xu Xin&#x27;s &quot;Karamay&quot; (2010), Zhao Liang&#x27;s Behemoth, Huang Weikai&#x27;s &quot;Disorder&quot; (2009), Zhao Dayong&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Town&quot; (2009), Du Haibing&#x27;s &quot;1428&quot; (2009), Xu Tong&#x27;s &quot;Fortune Teller&quot; (2009) and Li Ning&#x27;s &quot;Tape&quot; (2010) were all shot in digital format. All had made their impact in the international documentary scene and the use of digital format allows for works of vaster lengths.

== Animation ==
=== Before the 1950s ===
Inspired by the success of Disney animation, the self-taught pioneers Wan brothers, Wan Laiming and Wan Guchan, made the first Chinese animated short in the 1920s, thus inaugurating the history of Chinese animation. (Chen Yuanyuan 175) Many live-action films of the Republican era also included animated sequences.

In 1937, the Wan brothers decided to produce 《铁扇公主》&quot; Princess Iron Fan&quot;, which was the first Chinese animated feature film and the fourth, after the American feature films &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;. It was at this time that Chinese animation as an art form had risen to prominence on the world stage. Completed in 1941, the film was released under China United Pictures and aroused a great response in Asia. Japanese animator Shigeru Tezuka once said that he gave up medicine after watching the cartoon and decided to pursue animation.

=== 1950s–1980s ===
During this golden era, Chinese animation had developed a variety of styles, including ink animation, shadow play animation, puppet animation, and so on. Some of the most representative works are 《大闹天宫》&quot; Uproar in Heaven&quot;, 《哪吒闹海》 &quot;Nezha&#x27;s Rebellion in the Sea&quot; and《天书奇谈》 &quot;Heavenly Book&quot;, which have also won lofty praise and numerous awards in the world.

=== 1980s–1990s ===
After Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s Reform Period and the &quot;opening up&quot; of China, the movies《葫芦兄弟》 &quot;Calabash Brothers&quot;, 《黑猫警长》&quot;Black Cat Sheriff&quot;, 《阿凡提》&quot;Avanti Story&quot; and other impressive animated movies were released. However, at this time, China still favored the Japanese&#x27;s more unique, American and European-influenced animated works over the less-advanced domestic ones.

=== 1990s–2010s ===
In the 1990s, digital production methods replaced manual hand-drawing methods; however, even with the use of advanced technology, none of the animated works were considered to be a breakthrough film. Animated films that tried to cater to all age groups, such as &quot;Lotus Lantern&quot; and &quot;Storm Resolution&quot;, did not attract much attention. The only animated works that seemed to achieve popularity were the ones for catered for children, such as &quot;Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf&quot;《喜羊羊与灰太狼》.

=== 2010s–present ===

During this period, the technical level of Chinese domestic animation production has been established comprehensively, and 3D animation films have become the mainstream. However, as more and more foreign films (such as ones from Japan, Europe, and the United States) are being imported into China, Chinese animated works is left in the shadows of these animated foreign films.

It was only with the release of 《西游记之大圣归来》&quot;Monkey King: Hero is Back&quot; in 2015, a computer-animated film, that Chinese animated works took back the rein. The film was a huge hit and broke the record for Chinese domestic animated movies with CN¥956 million at China&#x27;s box office. After the success of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, several other high-quality animated films were released, such as《大鱼海棠》 &quot;Big Fish and Begonia&quot; and 《白蛇缘起》 &quot;White Snake&quot;. Though none of these movies made headway in regards to the box office, they did make filmmakers more and more interested in animated works.

This all changed with the breakthrough animated film, 《哪吒之魔童降世》&quot;Ne Zha&quot;. Released in 2019, it became the second highest-grossing film of all time in China, the highest-grossing animated non-English film, and the highest-grossing animated film in a single territory. It was with this film that Chinese animated films, as a medium, finally broke the notion in China that domestic animated films are only for children. With &quot;Nezha&quot;, and a spinoff, &quot;Jiang Ziya&quot;, Chinese animation has now come to be known as a veritable source of entertainment for all ages.

==New models and the new Chinese cinema==
===Commercial successes===
With China&#x27;s liberalization in the late 1970s and its opening up to foreign markets, commercial considerations have made its impact in post-1980s filmmaking. Traditionally arthouse movies screened seldom make enough to break even. An example is Fifth Generation director Tian Zhuangzhuang&#x27;s &quot;The Horse Thief&quot; (1986), a narrative film with minimal dialog on a Tibetan horse thief. The film, showcasing exotic landscapes, was well received by Chinese and some Western arthouse audiences, but did poorly at the box office.
Tian&#x27;s later &quot;The Warrior and the Wolf&quot; (2010) was a similar commercial failure. Prior to these, there were examples of successful commercial films in the post-liberalization period. One was the romance film &quot;Romance on the Lu Mountain&quot; (1980), which was a success with older Chinese. The film broke the Guinness Book of Records as the longest-running film on a first run. Jet Li&#x27;s cinematic debut &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot; (1982) was an instant hit at home and abroad (in Japan and the Southeast Asia, for example). Another successful commercial film was (405谋杀案, 1980), a murder thriller.

Feng Xiaogang&#x27;s &quot;The Dream Factory&quot; (1997) was heralded as a turning point in Chinese movie industry, a &quot;hesui pian&quot; (Chinese New Year-screened film) which demonstrated the viability of the commercial model in China&#x27;s socialist market economy. Feng has become one of the most successful commercial director in the post-1997 era. Almost all his films made high returns domestically while he used ethnic Chinese co-stars like Rosamund Kwan, Jacqueline Wu, Rene Liu and Shu Qi to boost his films&#x27; appeal.

In the decade following 2010, owing to the influx of Hollywood films (though the number screened each year is curtailed), Chinese domestic cinema faces mounting challenges. The industry is growing and domestic films are starting to achieve the box office impact of major Hollywood blockbusters. However, not all domestic films are successful financially. In January 2010 James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; was pulled out from non-3D theaters for Hu Mei&#x27;s biopic &quot;Confucius&quot;, but this move led to a backlash on Hu&#x27;s film. Zhang Yang&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Sunflower&quot; also made little money, but his earlier, low-budget &quot;Spicy Love Soup&quot; (1997) grossed ten times its budget of ¥3 million. Likewise, the 2006 &quot;Crazy Stone&quot;, a sleeper hit, was made for just 3 million HKD/US$400,000. In 2009–11, Feng&#x27;s &quot;Aftershock&quot; (2009) and Jiang Wen&#x27;s &quot;Let the Bullets Fly&quot; (2010) became China&#x27;s highest grossing domestic films, with &quot;Aftershock&quot; earning ¥670 million (US$105 million) and &quot;Let the Bullets Fly&quot; ¥674 million (US$110 million). &quot;Lost in Thailand&quot; (2012) became the first Chinese film to reach ¥1 billion at the Chinese box office and &quot;Monster Hunt&quot; (2015) became the first to reach . As of 2021, 9 of the top 10 highest-grossing films in China are domestic productions. On 8 February 2016, the Chinese box office set a new single-day gross record, with , beating the previous record of on 18 July 2015. Also in February 2016, &quot;The Mermaid&quot;, directed by Stephen Chow, became the highest-grossing film in China, overtaking &quot;Monster Hunt&quot;. It is also the first film to reach .

Under the influence of Hollywood science fiction movies like &quot;Prometheus&quot;, published on 8 June 2012, such genres especially the space science films have risen rapidly in the Chinese film market in recent years. On 5 February 2019, the film &quot;The Wandering Earth&quot; directed by Frant Gwo reached $699.8 million worldwide, which became the third highest-grossing film in the history of Chinese cinema.

===Chinese international cinema and successes abroad===


Since the late 1980s and progressively in the 2000s, Chinese films have enjoyed considerable box office success abroad. Formerly viewed only by cineastes, its global appeal mounted after the international box office and critical success of Ang Lee&#x27;s period wuxia film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; which won Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2000. This multi-national production increased its appeal by featuring stars from all parts of the Chinese-speaking world. It provided an introduction to Chinese cinema (and especially the wuxia genre) for many and increased the popularity of many earlier Chinese films. To date &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; remains the most commercially successful foreign-language film in U.S. history.

In 2002, Zhang Yimou&#x27;s &quot;Hero&quot; was another international box office success. Its cast featured famous actors from mainland China and Hong Kong who were also known to some extent in the West, including Jet Li, Zhang Ziyi, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai. Despite criticisms by some that these two films pander somewhat to Western tastes, &quot;Hero&quot; was a phenomenal success in most of Asia and topped the U.S. box office for two weeks, making enough in the U.S. alone to cover the production costs.

Other films such as &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;, &quot;2046&quot;, &quot;Suzhou River&quot;, &quot;The Road Home&quot; and &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; were critically acclaimed around the world. The Hengdian World Studios can be seen as the &quot;Chinese Hollywood&quot;, with a total area of up to 330 ha. and 13 shooting bases, including a 1:1 copy of the Forbidden City.

The successes of &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot; make it difficult to demarcate the boundary between &quot;Mainland Chinese&quot; cinema and a more international-based &quot;Chinese-language cinema&quot;. &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot;, for example, was directed by a Taiwan-born American director (Ang Lee) who works often in Hollywood. Its pan-Chinese leads include mainland Chinese (Zhang Ziyi), Hong Kong (Chow Yun-Fat), Taiwan (Chang Chen) and Malaysian (Michelle Yeoh) actors and actresses; the film was co-produced by an array of Chinese, American, Hong Kong, and Taiwan film companies. Likewise, Lee&#x27;s Chinese-language &quot;Lust, Caution&quot; (2007) drew a crew and cast from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and includes an orchestral score by French composer Alexandre Desplat. This merging of people, resources and expertise from the three regions and the broader East Asia and the world, marks the movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. Other examples of films in this mold include &quot;The Promise&quot; (2005), &quot;The Banquet&quot; (2006), &quot;Fearless&quot; (2006), &quot;The Warlords&quot; (2007), &quot;Bodyguards and Assassins&quot; (2009) and &quot;Red Cliff&quot; (2008–09). The ease with which ethnic Chinese actresses and actors straddle the mainland and Hong Kong has significantly increased the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema. Many of these films also feature South Korean or Japanese actors to appeal to their East Asian neighbours. Some artistes originating from the mainland, like Hu Jun, Zhang Ziyi, Tang Wei and Zhou Xun, obtained Hong Kong residency under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme and have acted in many Hong Kong productions.

==Industry==

===Box office and screens=== 
In 1983, there were 162,000 projection units in China, up from less than 600 at the 1949 founding of the PRC.

In 1998, the Ministry of Culture revived the practice of mobile rural cinema as part of its 2131 Project which aimed to screen one movie per month per village in rural China and upgrade analog equipment to digital projectors. In 2003, the central government provided more than 400 film projection vans to Tibet and Xinjiang to show films in an effort to oppose what the government viewed as separatism and Westernization.

In 2010, Chinese cinema was the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. In 2013, China&#x27;s gross box office was ¥21.8 billion (US$3.6 billion), the second-largest film market in the world by box office receipts.

Chinese films accounted for 61.48% of ticket sales in 2015 (up from 54% last year) with more than 60% of ticket sales being made online. Average ticket price was down about 2.5% to $5.36 in 2015. It also witnessed 51.08% increase in admissions, with 1.26 billion people buying tickets to the cinema in 2015. Chinese films grossed overseas in 2015.
