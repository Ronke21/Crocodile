<text>Gypsum is a soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate, with the chemical formula . It is widely mined and is used as a fertilizer and as the main constituent in many forms of plaster, drywall and blackboard or sidewalk chalk. Gypsum also crystallizes as translucent crystals of selenite. It forms as an evaporite mineral and as a hydration product of anhydrite. The Mohs scale of mineral hardness defines gypsum as hardness value 2 based on scratch hardness comparison.

Fine-grained white or lightly tinted forms of gypsum known as alabaster have been used for sculpture by many cultures including Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Ancient Rome, the Byzantine Empire, and the Nottingham alabasters of Medieval England.

==Etymology and history==

The word &quot;&quot; is derived from the Greek word (), &quot;plaster&quot;. Because the quarries of the Montmartre district of Paris have long furnished burnt gypsum (calcined gypsum) used for various purposes, this dehydrated gypsum became known as plaster of Paris. Upon adding water, after a few dozen minutes, plaster of Paris becomes regular gypsum (dihydrate) again, causing the material to harden or &quot;set&quot; in ways that are useful for casting and construction.

Gypsum was known in Old English as , &quot;spear stone&quot;, referring to its crystalline projections. Thus, the word spar in mineralogy, by comparison to gypsum, refers to any non-ore mineral or crystal that forms in spearlike projections. In the mid-18th century, the German clergyman and agriculturalist Johann Friderich Mayer investigated and publicized gypsum&#x27;s use as a fertilizer. Gypsum may act as a source of sulfur for plant growth, and in the early 19th century, it was regarded as an almost miraculous fertilizer. American farmers were so anxious to acquire it that a lively smuggling trade with Nova Scotia evolved, resulting in the so-called &quot;Plaster War&quot; of 1820.

==Physical properties==

Gypsum is moderately water-soluble (~2.0–2.5 g/L at 25 °C) and, in contrast to most other salts, it exhibits retrograde solubility, becoming less soluble at higher temperatures. When gypsum is heated in air it loses water and converts first to calcium sulfate hemihydrate (bassanite, often simply called &quot;plaster&quot;) and, if heated further, to anhydrous calcium sulfate (anhydrite). As with anhydrite, the solubility of gypsum in saline solutions and in brines is also strongly dependent on sodium chloride (common table salt) concentration.

The structure of gypsum consists of layers of calcium (Ca2+) and sulfate () ions tightly bound together. These layers are bonded by sheets of anion water molecules via weaker hydrogen bonding, which gives the crystal perfect cleavage along the sheets (in the {010} plane).

==Crystal varieties==

Gypsum occurs in nature as flattened and often twinned crystals, and transparent, cleavable masses called selenite. Selenite contains no significant selenium; rather, both substances were named for the ancient Greek word for the Moon.

Selenite may also occur in a silky, fibrous form, in which case it is commonly called &quot;satin spar&quot;. Finally, it may also be granular or quite compact. In hand-sized samples, it can be anywhere from transparent to opaque. A very fine-grained white or lightly tinted variety of gypsum, called alabaster, is prized for ornamental work of various sorts. In arid areas, gypsum can occur in a flower-like form, typically opaque, with embedded sand grains called desert rose. It also forms some of the largest crystals found in nature, up to long, in the form of selenite.

==Occurrence==
Gypsum is a common mineral, with thick and extensive evaporite beds in association with sedimentary rocks. Deposits are known to occur in strata from as far back as the Archaean eon. Gypsum is deposited from lake and sea water, as well as in hot springs, from volcanic vapors, and sulfate solutions in veins. Hydrothermal anhydrite in veins is commonly hydrated to gypsum by groundwater in near-surface exposures. It is often associated with the minerals halite and sulfur. Gypsum is the most common sulfate mineral. Pure gypsum is white, but other substances found as impurities may give a wide range of colors to local deposits.

Because gypsum dissolves over time in water, gypsum is rarely found in the form of sand. However, the unique conditions of the White Sands National Park in the US state of New Mexico have created a expanse of white gypsum sand, enough to supply the US construction industry with drywall for 1,000 years.
Commercial exploitation of the area, strongly opposed by area residents, was permanently prevented in 1933 when President Herbert Hoover declared the gypsum dunes a protected national monument.

Gypsum is also formed as a by-product of sulfide oxidation, amongst others by pyrite oxidation, when the sulfuric acid generated reacts with calcium carbonate. Its presence indicates oxidizing conditions. Under reducing conditions, the sulfates it contains can be reduced back to sulfide by sulfate-reducing bacteria. This can lead to accumulation of elemental sulfur in oil-bearing formations, such as salt domes, where it can be mined using the Frasch process Electric power stations burning coal with flue gas desulfurization produce large quantities of gypsum as a byproduct from the scrubbers.

Orbital pictures from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) have indicated the existence of gypsum dunes in the northern polar region of Mars, which were later confirmed at ground level by the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) &quot;Opportunity&quot;.
==Mining==
Commercial quantities of gypsum are found in the cities of Araripina and Grajaú in Brazil; in Pakistan, Jamaica, Iran (world&#x27;s second largest producer), Thailand, Spain (the main producer in Europe), Germany, Italy, England, Ireland, Canada and the United States. Large open pit quarries are located in many places including Fort Dodge, Iowa, which sits on one of the largest deposits of gypsum in the world, and Plaster City, California, United States, and East Kutai, Kalimantan, Indonesia. Several small mines also exist in places such as Kalannie in Western Australia, where gypsum is sold to private buyers for additions of calcium and sulfur as well as reduction of aluminum toxicities on soil for agricultural purposes.

Crystals of gypsum up to long have been found in the caves of the Naica Mine of Chihuahua, Mexico. The crystals thrived in the cave&#x27;s extremely rare and stable natural environment. Temperatures stayed at , and the cave was filled with mineral-rich water that drove the crystals&#x27; growth. The largest of those crystals weighs and is around 500,000 years old.
==Synthesis==
Synthetic gypsum is produced as a waste product or by-product in a range of industrial processes.

=== Desulfurization ===
Flue gas desulfurization gypsum (FGDG) is recovered at some coal-fired power plants. The main contaminants are Mg, K, Cl, F, B, Al, Fe, Si, and Se. They come both from the limestone used in desulfurization and from the coal burned. This product is pure enough to replace natural gypsum in a wide variety of fields including drywalls, water treatment, and cement set retarder. Improvements in flue gas desulfurization have greatly reduced the amount of toxic elements present.

=== Desalination ===
Gypsum precipitates onto brackish water membranes, a phenomenon known as mineral salt scaling, such as during brackish water desalination of water with high concentrations of calcium and sulfate. Scaling decreases membrane life and productivity. This is one of the main obstacles in brackish water membrane desalination processes, such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration. Other forms of scaling, such as calcite scaling, depending on the water source, can also be important considerations in distillation, as well as in heat exchangers, where either the salt solubility or concentration can change rapidly.

A new study has suggested that the formation of gypsum starts as tiny crystals of a mineral called bassanite (2CaSO4·H2O). This process occurs via a three-stage pathway: 
# homogeneous nucleation of nanocrystalline bassanite; 
# self-assembly of bassanite into aggregates, and 
# transformation of bassanite into gypsum.

=== Refinery waste ===
The production of phosphate fertilizers requires breaking down calcium-containing phosphate rock with acid, producing calcium sulfate waste known as phosphogypsum (PG). This form of gypsum is contaminated by impurities found in the rock, namely fluoride, silica, radioactive elements such as radium, and heavy metal elements such as cadmium. Similarly, production of titanium dioxide produces titanium gypsum (TG) due to neutralization of excess acid with lime. The product is contaminated with silica, fluorides, organic matters, and alkalis.

Impurities in refinery gypsum waste have, in many cases, prevented them from being used as normal gypsum in fields such as construction. As a result, waste gypsum is stored in stacks indefinitely, with significant risk of leaching their contaminants into water and soil. To reduce the accumulation and ultimately clear out these stacks, research is underway to find more applications for such waste products.

== Occupational safety ==

People can be exposed to gypsum in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, and eye contact. Calcium sulfate &quot;per se&quot; is nontoxic and is even approved as a food additive, but as powdered gypsum, it can irritate skin and mucous membranes.

===United States===
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for gypsum exposure in the workplace as TWA 15 mg/m3 for total exposure and TWA 5 mg/m3 for respiratory exposure over an eight-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 10 mg/m3 for total exposure and TWA 5 mg/m3 for respiratory exposure over an eight-hour workday.

==Uses==


Gypsum is used in a wide variety of applications:

===Construction industry===
*Gypsum board is primarily used as a finish for walls and ceilings, and is known in construction as plasterboard, &quot;sheetrock&quot;, or drywall. Gypsum provides a degree of fire-resistance to these materials, and glass fibers are added to their composition to accentuate this effect. Gypsum has negligible heat conductivity, giving its plaster some insulative properties.
*Gypsum blocks are used like concrete blocks in construction.
*Gypsum mortar is an ancient mortar used in construction.
*A component of Portland cement used to prevent flash setting (too rapid hardening) of concrete.
*A wood substitute in the ancient world: For example, when wood became scarce due to deforestation on Bronze Age Crete, gypsum was employed in building construction at locations where wood was previously used.

===Agriculture===
*Fertilizer: In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Nova Scotia gypsum, often referred to as plaster, was a highly sought fertilizer for wheat fields in the United States. Gypsum provides two of the secondary plant macronutrients, calcium and sulfur. Unlike limestone, it generally does not affect soil pH.
*Reclamation of saline soils, regardless of pH. When gypsum is added to sodic (saline) and acidic soil, the highly soluble form of boron (sodium metaborate) is converted to the less soluble calcium metaborate. The exchangeable sodium percentage is also reduced by gypsum application. The Zuiderzee Works uses gypsum for the recovered land.
*Other soil conditioner uses: Gypsum reduces aluminium and boron toxicity in acidic soils. It also improves soil structure, water absorption, and aeration.
*Soil water potential monitoring: a gypsum block can be inserted into the soil, and its electrical resistance can be measured to derive soil moisture.

===Modeling, sculpture and art===
*Plaster for casting moulds and modeling.
*As alabaster, a material for sculpture, it was used especially in the ancient world before steel was developed, when its relative softness made it much easier to carve. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was preferred even to marble. 
*In the medieval period, scribes and illuminators used it as an ingredient in gesso, which was applied to illuminated letters and gilded with gold in illuminated manuscripts.

===Food and drink===
*A tofu (soy bean curd) coagulant, making it ultimately a significant source of dietary calcium.
*Adding hardness to water used for brewing.
*Used in baking as a dough conditioner, reducing stickiness, and as a baked goods source of dietary calcium. The primary component of mineral yeast food.
*Used in mushroom cultivation to stop grains from clumping together.

===Medicine and cosmetics===
*Plaster for surgical splints.
*Impression plasters in dentistry.

===Other===
*An alternative to iron oxide in some thermite mixes.
*Tests have shown that gypsum can be used to remove pollutants such as lead or arsenic from contaminated waters.

<text>A growth factor is a naturally occurring substance capable of stimulating cell proliferation, wound healing, and occasionally cellular differentiation. Usually it is a secreted protein or a steroid hormone. Growth factors are important for regulating a variety of cellular processes.

Growth factors typically act as signaling molecules between cells. Examples are cytokines and hormones that bind to specific receptors on the surface of their target cells.

They often promote cell differentiation and maturation, which varies between growth factors. For example, epidermal growth factor (EGF) enhances osteogenic differentiation (osteogenesis or bone formation), while fibroblast growth factors and vascular endothelial growth factors stimulate blood vessel differentiation (angiogenesis).

== Comparison to cytokines ==
&quot;Growth factor&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably among scientists with the term &quot;cytokine.&quot; Historically, cytokines were associated with hematopoietic (blood and lymph forming) cells and immune system cells (e.g., lymphocytes and tissue cells from spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes). For the circulatory system and bone marrow in which cells can occur in a liquid suspension and not bound up in solid tissue, it makes sense for them to communicate by soluble, circulating protein molecules. However, as different lines of research converged, it became clear that some of the same signaling proteins which the hematopoietic and immune systems use were also being used by all sorts of other cells and tissues, during development and in the mature organism.

While &quot;growth factor&quot; implies a positive effect on cell proliferation, &quot;cytokine&quot; is a neutral term with respect to whether a molecule affects proliferation. While some cytokines can be growth factors, such as G-CSF and GM-CSF, others have an inhibitory effect on cell growth or cell proliferation. Some cytokines, such as Fas ligand, are used as &quot;death&quot; signals; they cause target cells to undergo programmed cell death or &quot;apoptosis&quot;.

The nerve growth factor (NGF) was first discovered by Rita Levi-Montalcini, which won her a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

== In platelets ==
The alpha granules in blood platelets contain growth factors PDGF, IGF-1, EGF, and TGF-β which begin healing of wounds by attracting and activating macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.

== Uses in medicine ==
For the last two decades, growth factors have been increasingly used in the treatment of hematologic and oncologic diseases and cardiovascular diseases such as:

* skin wound healing and regeneration of other tissues such as bone (PDGF-BB)
* neutropenia
* myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
* leukemias
* aplastic anaemia
* bone marrow transplantation
* angiogenesis for cardiovascular diseases

<text>Giuseppe Peano (; ; 27 August 1858 – 20 April 1932) was an Italian mathematician and glottologist. The author of over 200 books and papers, he was a founder of mathematical logic and set theory, to which he contributed much notation. The standard axiomatization of the natural numbers is named the Peano axioms in his honor. As part of this effort, he made key contributions to the modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the method of mathematical induction. He spent most of his career teaching mathematics at the University of Turin. He also created an international auxiliary language, Latino sine flexione (&quot;Latin without inflections&quot;), which is a simplified version of Classical Latin. Most of his books and papers are in Latino sine flexione, while others are in Italian.

==Biography==

Peano was born and raised on a farm at Spinetta, a hamlet now belonging to Cuneo, Piedmont, Italy. He attended the Liceo classico Cavour in Turin, and enrolled at the University of Turin in 1876, graduating in 1880 with high honours, after which the University employed him to assist first Enrico D&#x27;Ovidio, and then Angelo Genocchi, the Chair of calculus. Due to Genocchi&#x27;s poor health, Peano took over the teaching of calculus course within two years. His first major work, a textbook on calculus entitled &quot;Calcolo differenziale, e principii di calcolo integrale&quot;, was published in 1884 and was credited to Genocchi. A few years later, Peano published his first book dealing with mathematical logic. Here the modern symbols for the union and intersection of sets appeared for the first time.

Peano joined Freemasonry. It is not known where he was initiated, but on December 24, 1885, he was affiliated as Master in the &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot; Masonic Lodge in Turin. Here he knew the Italian socialist and freemason Giovanni Lerda (1853-1927), a close collaborator of Cesare Lombroso.

In 1887, Peano married Carola Crosio, the daughter of the Turin-based painter Luigi Crosio, known for painting the &quot;Refugium Peccatorum Madonna&quot;. In 1886, he began teaching concurrently at the Royal Military Academy, and was promoted to Professor First Class in 1889. In that year he published the Peano axioms, a formal foundation for the collection of natural numbers. The next year, the University of Turin also granted him his full professorship. The Peano curve was published in 1890 as the first example of a space-filling curve which demonstrated that the unit interval and the unit square have the same cardinality. Today it is understood to be an early example of what is known as a fractal.

In 1890 Peano founded the journal &quot;Rivista di Matematica&quot;, which published its first issue in January 1891. In 1891 Peano started the Formulario Project. It was to be an &quot;Encyclopedia of Mathematics&quot;, containing all known formulae and theorems of mathematical science using a standard notation invented by Peano. In 1897, the first International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Zürich. Peano was a key participant, presenting a paper on mathematical logic. He also started to become increasingly occupied with &quot;Formulario&quot; to the detriment of his other work.

In 1898 he presented a note to the Academy about binary numeration and its ability to be used to represent the sounds of languages. He also became so frustrated with publishing delays (due to his demand that formulae be printed on one line) that he purchased a printing press.

Paris was the venue for the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900. The conference was preceded by the First International Conference of Philosophy where Peano was a member of the patronage committee. He presented a paper which posed the question of correctly formed definitions in mathematics, &quot;i.e.&quot; &quot;how do you define a definition?&quot;. This became one of Peano&#x27;s main philosophical interests for the rest of his life. At the conference, Peano met Bertrand Russell and gave him a copy of &quot;Formulario&quot;. Russell was struck by Peano&#x27;s innovative logical symbols and after the conference, he retired to the country &quot;to study quietly every word written by him or his disciples&quot;.

Peano&#x27;s students Mario Pieri and Alessandro Padoa also had papers presented at the philosophy congress. For the mathematical congress, Peano did not speak, but Padoa&#x27;s memorable presentation has been frequently recalled. A resolution calling for the formation of an &quot;international auxiliary language&quot; to facilitate the spread of mathematical (and commercial) ideas, was proposed; Peano fully supported it.

By 1901, Peano was at the peak of his mathematical career. He had made advances in the areas of analysis, foundations and logic, made many contributions to the teaching of calculus and also contributed to the fields of differential equations and vector analysis. Peano played a key role in the axiomatization of mathematics and was a leading pioneer in the development of mathematical logic. Peano had by this stage become heavily involved with the &quot;Formulario&quot; project and his teaching began to suffer. In fact, he became so determined to teach his new mathematical symbols that the calculus in his course was neglected. As a result, he was dismissed from the Royal Military Academy but retained his post at Turin University.

In 1903 Peano announced his work on an international auxiliary language called &quot;Latino sine flexione&quot; (&quot;Latin without inflexion,&quot; later called Interlingua, and the precursor of the Interlingua of the IALA). This was an important project for him (along with finding contributors for &#x27;Formulario&#x27;). The idea was to use Latin vocabulary, since this was widely known, but simplify the grammar as much as possible and remove all irregular and anomalous forms to make it easier to learn. On 3 January 1908, he read a paper to the &quot;Academia delle Scienze di Torino&quot; in which he started speaking in Latin and, as he described each simplification, introduced it into his speech so that by the end he was talking in his new language.

The year 1908 was important for Peano. The fifth and final edition of the &quot;Formulario&quot; project, titled &quot;Formulario mathematico&quot;, was published. It contained 4200 formulae and theorems, all completely stated and most of them proved. The book received little attention since much of the content was dated by this time. However, it remains a significant contribution to mathematical literature. The comments and examples were written in &quot;Latino sine flexione&quot;.

Also in 1908, Peano took over the chair of higher analysis at Turin (this appointment was to last for only two years). He was elected the director of &quot;Academia pro Interlingua&quot;. Having previously created Idiom Neutral, the Academy effectively chose to abandon it in favour of Peano&#x27;s Latino sine flexione.

After his mother died in 1910, Peano divided his time between teaching, working on texts aimed for secondary schooling including a dictionary of mathematics, and developing and promoting his and other auxiliary languages, becoming a revered member of the international auxiliary language movement. He used his membership of the &quot;Accademia dei Lincei&quot; to present papers written by friends and colleagues who were not members (the Accademia recorded and published all presented papers given in sessions).

During the years 1913–1918, Peano published several papers that dealt with the remainder term for various numerical quadrature formulas, and introduced the Peano kernel.

In 1925 Peano switched Chairs unofficially from Infinitesimal Calculus to Complementary Mathematics, a field which better suited his current style of mathematics. This move became official in 1931. Giuseppe Peano continued teaching at Turin University until the day before he died when he suffered a fatal heart attack.

<text>A gin and tonic is a highball cocktail made with gin and tonic water poured over a large amount of ice. The ratio of gin to tonic varies according to taste, strength of the gin, other drink mixers being added, etc., with most recipes calling for a ratio between 1:1 and 1:3. It is usually garnished with a slice or wedge of lime. To preserve effervescence, the tonic can be poured down a bar spoon. The ice cools the gin, dulling the effect of the alcohol in the mouth and making the drink more pleasant and refreshing to taste.

It is commonly referred to as a G and T in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. In some parts of the world (e.g., in Germany, Italy, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey), it is called a . It is also referred to as &quot;ginto&quot; in the Netherlands, and as &quot;GT&quot; in the Nordics.

==Garnish and serving==
Gin and tonic is traditionally garnished with a slice or wedge of lime, often slightly squeezed into the drink before being placed in the glass. In most parts of the world, lime remains the only usual garnish; however, lemon is often used as an alternative fruit. In the United Kingdom, the use of both lemon and lime together is known as an &quot;Evans&quot;. Although the origins of the use of lemons are unknown, their use dates back at least as far as the late 1930s. The use of lemon or lime is a debated issue – some leading brands, such as Gordon&#x27;s, Tanqueray, and Bombay Sapphire, recommend the use of lime in their gin.

The use of a balloon glass for serving gin has become popular, possibly through promotion by the Bombay Sapphire gin brand. The use of such a glass, with plenty of ice and a garnish tailored to the flavours of the gin, is sometimes said to allow the aromas of the drink to gather at its opening for the drinker to more easily appreciate.

The use of assorted fruits, herbs, and vegetables, as garnish (reflecting the botanicals of the individual gin), is increasingly popular. Besides the classic lime wheel or wedge, alternative garnishes can include orange peel, star anise, thyme-elderflower, a slice of ginger, pink grapefruit, rosemary, cucumber, mint, black peppercorns, strawberry and basil, strawberry syrup, or chillies. Fruits such as kumquats or other citrus or cucumber can be included.

== History ==
The cocktail was created by officers of the Presidency armies, the military force of the East India Company which operated on the Indian subcontinent. On the Indian subcontinent and in other tropical regions, malaria was a persistent problem for Europeans, and in the 18th century, Scottish doctor George Cleghorn studied how quinine, a traditional cure for malaria, could be used to prevent the disease. The quinine was drunk in tonic water but the bitter taste was unpleasant. Presidency armies officers in India in the early 19th century took to adding a mixture of water, sugar, lime and gin to the quinine in order to make the drink more palatable, and thus the gin and tonic cocktail was born. The officers were already given a gin ration as part of their rations, and the sweet concoction made sense. Since it is no longer used as an antimalarial, tonic water today contains much less quinine, is usually sweetened, and is consequently much less bitter.

A 2004 study found that after 12 hours, &quot;considerable quantities (500 to 1,000 ml) of tonic water may, for a short period of time, lead to quinine plasma levels at the lower limit of therapeutic efficacy and may, in fact, cause transitory suppression of parasites&quot;. This method of consumption of quinine was impractical for malaria prophylaxis, as the amount of drug needed &quot;cannot be maintained with even large amounts of tonic&quot;. The authors concluded that it is not an effective form of treatment for malaria.

==Variations==

Mixers can include lime juice, lemon juice, orange juice and spiced simple syrup, grenadine, tea, etc.

A gin and tonic can also be mixed with a sorbet.

Some gin-and-tonic inspired drinks also have champagne (e.g., the Parisian), vermouth and Campari (e.g. the Negroni Sbagliato), vermouth and bitters (e.g., the Posh G&amp;T), super smokey whiskey (e.g., the Ol&#x27; Smokey), peach liqueur and grapefruit bitters (e.g., the Tonic Delight), mint bitters, and chocolate liqueur (e.g., the Guilty Pleasure), etc.

==In popular culture==
The trans-galactic nature of the gin and tonic is imagined in Douglas Adams&#x27;s novel &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;, which describes how &quot;85% of all known worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee-N&#x27;N-T&#x27;N-ix, or jinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic theme. The drinks themselves are not the same, and vary between the Sivolvian &#x27;chinanto/mnigs&#x27; which is ordinary water served at slightly above room temperature, and the Gagrakackan &#x27;tzjin-anthony-ks&#x27; which kills cows at a hundred paces; and in fact the one common factor between all of them, beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they were all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact with any other worlds.&quot;

In &quot;Top Gear&quot; and&quot; The Grand Tour&quot;, Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond were known to be quite fond of the drink, and drank them on camera a number of times, in one case causing controversy when Jeremy Clarkson appeared to drink one whilst behind the wheel of a car driving to the North Pole. James May later teamed up with Hugh Anderson of Downton Distillery to create his own brand of gin, named James Gin.

James Bond specifies a recipe for a gin and tonic while in Kingston, Jamaica, in the book &quot;Dr. No&quot;. Unusually, it involves the juice of a whole lime.

In the BBC1 and Amazon Prime television series &quot;Fleabag&quot;, Fleabag and the Priest enjoy canned G&amp;Ts from Marks and Spencer. The store reported a 24% increase in sales after the episodes aired. 

Founded in 2010, International Gin &amp; Tonic Day is celebrated worldwide on 19 October.

<text>A gimlet is a hand tool for drilling small holes, mainly in wood, without splitting. It was defined in Joseph Gwilt&#x27;s &quot;Architecture&quot; (1859) as &quot;a piece of steel of a semi-cylindrical form, hollow on one side, having a cross handle at one end and a worm or screw at the other&quot;.

A gimlet is always a small tool. A similar tool of larger size is called an auger. The cutting action of the gimlet is slightly different from an auger and the initial hole it makes is smaller; the cutting edges pare away the wood, which is moved out by the spiral sides, falling out through the entry hole. This also pulls the gimlet further into the hole as it is turned. Unlike a bradawl, pressure is not required once the tip has been drawn in.

The name &quot;gimlet&quot; comes from the Old French , , later , probably a diminutive of the Anglo-French , a variation of &quot;guimble&quot;, from the Middle Low German (cf. the Scandinavian , &#x27;to bore or twist&#x27;). Modern French uses the term , also the French for &quot;tendril&quot;.

==Use as a metaphor ==
The term is also used figuratively to describe something as sharp or piercing, along with describing the twisting, boring motion of using a gimlet. For example, the gimlet cocktail may be named after the tool. The term &quot;gimlet-eyed&quot; can mean sharp-eyed or squint-eyed. One example of this use is Major General Smedley Darlington Butler, who was known as &quot;Old Gimlet Eye&quot;.

<doc id="13046" wikidata="Q185049" url="?curid=13046" title="Geometric mean">
<text>In mathematics, the geometric mean is a mean or average which indicates a central tendency of a finite collection of positive real numbers by using the product of their values (as opposed to the arithmetic mean which uses their sum). The geometric mean of numbers is the th root of their product, i.e., for a collection of numbers , the geometric mean is defined as

:formula_1

When the collection of numbers and their geometric mean are plotted in logarithmic scale, the geometric mean is transformed into an arithmetic mean, so the geometric mean can equivalently be calculated by taking the natural logarithm of each number, finding the arithmetic mean of the logarithms, and then returning the result to linear scale using the exponential function ,

:formula_2

The geometric mean of two numbers is the square root of their product, for example with numbers and the geometric mean is formula_3 The geometric mean of the three numbers is the cube root of their product, for example with numbers , , and , the geometric mean is formula_4

The geometric mean is useful whenever the quantities to be averaged combine multiplicatively, such as population growth rates or interest rates of a financial investment. Suppose for example a person invests $1000 and achieves annual returns of +10%, −12%, +90%, −30% and +25%, giving a final value of $1609. The average percentage growth is the geometric mean of the annual growth ratios (1.10, 0.88, 1.90, 0.70, 1.25), namely 1.0998, an annual average growth of 9.98%. The arithmetic mean of these annual returns – 16.6% per annum – is not a meaningful average because growth rates do not combine additively.

The geometric mean can be understood in terms of geometry. The geometric mean of two numbers, formula_5 and formula_6, is the length of one side of a square whose area is equal to the area of a rectangle with sides of lengths formula_5 and formula_6. Similarly, the geometric mean of three numbers, formula_5, formula_6, and formula_11, is the length of one edge of a cube whose volume is the same as that of a cuboid with sides whose lengths are equal to the three given numbers.

The geometric mean is one of the three classical Pythagorean means, together with the arithmetic mean and the harmonic mean. For all positive data sets containing at least one pair of unequal values, the harmonic mean is always the least of the three means, while the arithmetic mean is always the greatest of the three and the geometric mean is always in between (see Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means.)

==Formulation==
The geometric mean of a data set formula_12 is given by:
:formula_13

That is, the &quot;n&quot;th root of the product of the elements. For example, for formula_14, the product formula_15 is formula_16, and the geometric mean is the fourth root of 24, approximately 2.213. 

===Formulation using logarithms ===
The geometric mean can also be expressed as the exponential of the arithmetic mean of logarithms. By using logarithmic identities to transform the formula, the multiplications can be expressed as a sum and the power as a multiplication:

When formula_17
: formula_18 
since formula_19 

This is sometimes called the log-average (not to be confused with the logarithmic average). It is simply the arithmetic mean of the logarithm-transformed values of formula_20 (i.e., the arithmetic mean on the log scale), using the exponentiation to return to the original scale, i.e., it is the generalized f-mean with formula_21. A logarithm of any base can be used in place of the natural logarithm. For example, the geometric mean of , , , and can be calculated using logarithms base 2:
:formula_22

Related to the above, it can be seen that for a given sample of points formula_23, the geometric mean is the minimizer of 
:formula_24, 
whereas the arithmetic mean is the minimizer of 
:formula_25. 
Thus, the geometric mean provides a summary of the samples whose exponent best matches the exponents of the samples (in the least squares sense).

In computer implementations, naïvely multiplying many numbers together can cause arithmetic overflow or underflow. Calculating the geometric mean using logarithms is one way to avoid this problem.

==Related concepts==

===Iterative means===
The geometric mean of a data set is less than the data set&#x27;s arithmetic mean unless all members of the data set are equal, in which case the geometric and arithmetic means are equal. This allows the definition of the arithmetic-geometric mean, an intersection of the two which always lies in between.

The geometric mean is also the arithmetic-harmonic mean in the sense that if two sequences (formula_26) and (formula_27) are defined:
:formula_28

and
:formula_29

where formula_30 is the harmonic mean of the previous values of the two sequences, then formula_26 and formula_27 will converge to the geometric mean of formula_33 and formula_34. The sequences converge to a common limit, and the geometric mean is preserved:
:formula_35

Replacing the arithmetic and harmonic mean by a pair of generalized means of opposite, finite exponents yields the same result.

===Comparison to arithmetic mean===

The geometric mean of a non-empty data set of positive numbers is always at most their arithmetic mean. Equality is only obtained when all numbers in the data set are equal; otherwise, the geometric mean is smaller. For example, the geometric mean of 2 and 3 is 2.45, while their arithmetic mean is 2.5. In particular, this means that when a set of non-identical numbers is subjected to a mean-preserving spread — that is, the elements of the set are &quot;spread apart&quot; more from each other while leaving the arithmetic mean unchanged — their geometric mean decreases.

===Geometric mean of a continuous function===
If formula_36 is a positive continuous real-valued function, its geometric mean over this interval is

:formula_37

For instance, taking the identity function formula_38 over the unit interval shows that the geometric mean of the positive numbers between 0 and 1 is equal to formula_39.

==Applications==

===Average proportional growth rate===

The geometric mean is more appropriate than the arithmetic mean for describing proportional growth, both exponential growth (constant proportional growth) and varying growth; in business the geometric mean of growth rates is known as the compound annual growth rate (CAGR). The geometric mean of growth over periods yields the equivalent constant growth rate that would yield the same final amount.

As an example, suppose an orange tree yields 100 oranges one year and then 180, 210 and 300 the following years, for growth rates of 80%, 16.7% and 42.9% respectively. Using the arithmetic mean calculates a (linear) average growth of 46.5% (calculated by formula_40). However, when applied to the 100 orange starting yield, 46.5% annual growth results in 314 oranges after three years of growth, rather than the observed 300. The linear average overstates the rate of growth.

Instead, using the geometric mean, the average yearly growth is approximately 44.2% (calculated by formula_41). Starting from a 100 orange yield with annual growth of 44.2% gives the expected 300 orange yield after three years.

In order to determine the average growth rate, it is not necessary to take the product of the measured growth rates at every step. Let the quantity be given as the sequence formula_42, where formula_43 is the number of steps from the initial to final state. The growth rate between successive measurements formula_44 and formula_45 is formula_46. The geometric mean of these growth rates is then just:
:formula_47

===Normalized values===
The fundamental property of the geometric mean, which does not hold for any other mean, is that for two sequences formula_48 and formula_49 of equal length,

: formula_50.

This makes the geometric mean the only correct mean when averaging &quot;normalized&quot; results; that is, results that are presented as ratios to reference values. This is the case when presenting computer performance with respect to a reference computer, or when computing a single average index from several heterogeneous sources (for example, life expectancy, education years, and infant mortality). In this scenario, using the arithmetic or harmonic mean would change the ranking of the results depending on what is used as a reference. For example, take the following comparison of execution time of computer programs:

Table 1
The arithmetic and geometric means &quot;agree&quot; that computer C is the fastest. However, by presenting appropriately normalized values &quot;and&quot; using the arithmetic mean, we can show either of the other two computers to be the fastest. Normalizing by A&#x27;s result gives A as the fastest computer according to the arithmetic mean:

Table 2
while normalizing by B&#x27;s result gives B as the fastest computer according to the arithmetic mean but A as the fastest according to the harmonic mean:

Table 3

and normalizing by C&#x27;s result gives C as the fastest computer according to the arithmetic mean but A as the fastest according to the harmonic mean:

Table 4

In all cases, the ranking given by the geometric mean stays the same as the one obtained with unnormalized values.

However, this reasoning has been questioned.
Giving consistent results is not always equal to giving the correct results. In general, it is more rigorous to assign weights to each of the programs, calculate the average weighted execution time (using the arithmetic mean), and then normalize that result to one of the computers. The three tables above just give a different weight to each of the programs, explaining the inconsistent results of the arithmetic and harmonic means (Table 4 gives equal weight to both programs, the Table 2 gives a weight of 1/1000 to the second program, and the Table 3 gives a weight of 1/100 to the second program and 1/10 to the first one). The use of the geometric mean for aggregating performance numbers should be avoided if possible, because multiplying execution times has no physical meaning, in contrast to adding times as in the arithmetic mean. Metrics that are inversely proportional to time (speedup, IPC) should be averaged using the harmonic mean.

The geometric mean can be derived from the generalized mean as its limit as formula_51 goes to zero. Similarly, this is possible for the weighted geometric mean.

===Financial===
The geometric mean has from time to time been used to calculate financial indices (the averaging is over the components of the index). For example, in the past the FT 30 index used a geometric mean. It is also used in the CPI calculation and recently introduced &quot;RPIJ&quot; measure of inflation in the United Kingdom and in the European Union.

This has the effect of understating movements in the index compared to using the arithmetic mean.

===Applications in the social sciences===

Although the geometric mean has been relatively rare in computing social statistics, starting from 2010 the United Nations Human Development Index did switch to this mode of calculation, on the grounds that it better reflected the non-substitutable nature of the statistics being compiled and compared:
: The geometric mean decreases the level of substitutability between dimensions [being compared] and at the same time ensures that a 1 percent decline in say life expectancy at birth has the same impact on the HDI as a 1 percent decline in education or income. Thus, as a basis for comparisons of achievements, this method is also more respectful of the intrinsic differences across the dimensions than a simple average.

Not all values used to compute the HDI (Human Development Index) are normalized; some of them instead have the form formula_52. This makes the choice of the geometric mean less obvious than one would expect from the &quot;Properties&quot; section above.

The equally distributed welfare equivalent income associated with an Atkinson Index with an inequality aversion parameter of 1.0 is simply the geometric mean of incomes. For values other than one, the equivalent value is an Lp norm divided by the number of elements, with p equal to one minus the inequality aversion parameter.

===Geometry===

In the case of a right triangle, its altitude is the length of a line extending perpendicularly from the hypotenuse to its 90° vertex. Imagining that this line splits the hypotenuse into two segments, the geometric mean of these segment lengths is the length of the altitude. This property is known as the geometric mean theorem.

In an ellipse, the semi-minor axis is the geometric mean of the maximum and minimum distances of the ellipse from a focus; it is also the geometric mean of the semi-major axis and the semi-latus rectum. The semi-major axis of an ellipse is the geometric mean of the distance from the center to either focus and the distance from the center to either directrix.
Another way to think about it is as follows:

Consider a circle with radius formula_53. Now take two diametrically opposite points on the circle and apply pressure from both ends to deform it into an ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axes of lengths formula_5 and formula_6.
Since the area of the circle and the ellipse stays the same, we have:

: formula_56

The radius of the circle is the geometric mean of the semi-major and the semi-minor axes of the ellipse formed by deforming the circle.

Distance to the horizon of a sphere (ignoring the effect of atmospheric refraction when atmosphere is present) is equal to the geometric mean of the distance to the closest point of the sphere and the distance to the farthest point of the sphere.

The geometric mean is used in both in the approximation of squaring the circle by S.A. Ramanujan and in the construction of the heptadecagon with &quot;mean proportionals&quot;.

===Aspect ratios===

The geometric mean has been used in choosing a compromise aspect ratio in film and video: given two aspect ratios, the geometric mean of them provides a compromise between them, distorting or cropping both in some sense equally. Concretely, two equal area rectangles (with the same center and parallel sides) of different aspect ratios intersect in a rectangle whose aspect ratio is the geometric mean, and their hull (smallest rectangle which contains both of them) likewise has the aspect ratio of their geometric mean.

In the choice of 16:9 aspect ratio by the SMPTE, balancing 2.35 and 4:3, the geometric mean is formula_57, and thus formula_58... was chosen. This was discovered empirically by Kerns Powers, who cut out rectangles with equal areas and shaped them to match each of the popular aspect ratios. When overlapped with their center points aligned, he found that all of those aspect ratio rectangles fit within an outer rectangle with an aspect ratio of 1.77:1 and all of them also covered a smaller common inner rectangle with the same aspect ratio 1.77:1. The value found by Powers is exactly the geometric mean of the extreme aspect ratios, 4:3(1.33:1) and CinemaScope(2.35:1), which is coincidentally close to formula_59 (formula_60). The intermediate ratios have no effect on the result, only the two extreme ratios.

Applying the same geometric mean technique to 16:9 and 4:3 approximately yields the 14:9 (formula_61...) aspect ratio, which is likewise used as a compromise between these ratios. In this case 14:9 is exactly the &quot;arithmetic mean&quot; of formula_59 and formula_63, since 14 is the average of 16 and 12, while the precise &quot;geometric mean&quot; is formula_64 but the two different &quot;means&quot;, arithmetic and geometric, are approximately equal because both numbers are sufficiently close to each other (a difference of less than 2%).

=== Paper formats ===

The geometric mean is also used to calculate B and C series paper formats. The formula_65 format has an area which is the geometric mean of the areas of formula_66 and formula_67. For example, the area of a B1 paper is formula_68, because it is the geometric mean of the areas of an A0 (formula_69) and an A1 (formula_70) paper 

The same principle applies with the C series, whose area is the geometric mean of the A and B series. For example, the C4 format has an area which is the geometric mean of the areas of A4 and B4.

An advantage that comes from this relationship is that an A4 paper fits inside a C4 envelope, and both fit inside a B4 envelope.

===Other applications===
*&quot;Spectral flatness&quot;: in signal processing, spectral flatness, a measure of how flat or spiky a spectrum is, is defined as the ratio of the geometric mean of the power spectrum to its arithmetic mean.
*&quot;Anti-reflective coatings&quot;: In optical coatings, where reflection needs to be minimized between two media of refractive indices &quot;n&quot;0 and &quot;n&quot;2, the optimum refractive index &quot;n&quot;1 of the anti-reflective coating is given by the geometric mean: formula_71.
*&quot;Subtractive color mixing&quot;: The spectral reflectance curve for paint mixtures (of equal tinting strength, opacity and dilution) is approximately the geometric mean of the paints&#x27; individual reflectance curves computed at each wavelength of their spectra.
*&quot;Image processing&quot;: The geometric mean filter is used as a noise filter in image processing.
*&quot;Labor compensation&quot;: The geometric mean of a subsistence wage and market value of the labor using capital of employer was suggested as the natural wage by Johann von Thünen in 1875.

<doc id="13049" wikidata="Q131333" url="?curid=13049" title="George Eliot">
<text>Mary Ann Evans (22 November 1819 – 22 December 1880; alternatively Mary Anne or Marian), known by her pen name George Eliot, was an English novelist, poet, journalist, translator, and one of the leading writers of the Victorian era. She wrote seven novels: &quot;Adam Bede&quot; (1859), &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; (1860), &quot;Silas Marner&quot; (1861), &quot;Romola&quot; (1862–1863), &quot;Felix Holt, the Radical&quot; (1866), &quot;Middlemarch&quot; (1871–1872) and &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot; (1876). As with Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy, she emerged from provincial England; most of her works are set there. Her works are known for their realism, psychological insight, sense of place and detailed depiction of the countryside. &quot;Middlemarch&quot; was described by the novelist Virginia Woolf as &quot;one of the few English novels written for grown-up people&quot; and by Martin Amis and Julian Barnes as the greatest novel in the English language.

Scandalously and unconventionally for the era, she lived with the married George Henry Lewes as his conjugal partner, from 1854 to 1878, and called him her husband. He remained married to his wife and supported their children, even after she left him to live with another man and have children with him. In May 1880, eighteen months after Lewes&#x27;s death, George Eliot married her long-time friend, John Cross, a man much younger than she was, and she changed her name to Mary Ann Cross.

== Life ==

=== Early life and education ===
Mary Ann Evans was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, at South Farm on the Arbury Hall estate. She was the third child of Robert Evans (1773–1849), manager of the Arbury Hall estate, and Christiana Evans (&quot;née&quot; Pearson, 1788–1836), daughter of a local mill-owner. Her full siblings were: Christiana, known as Chrissey (1814–1859), Isaac (1816–1890), and twin brothers who died a few days after birth in March 1821. She also had a half-brother, Robert Evans (1802–1864), and half-sister, Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Evans Houghton (1805–1882), from her father&#x27;s previous marriage to Harriet Poynton (1780–1809). In early 1820, the family moved to a house named Griff House, between Nuneaton and Bedworth.

The young Evans was a voracious reader and obviously intelligent. Because she was not considered physically beautiful, Evans was not thought to have much chance of marriage, and this, coupled with her intelligence, led her father to invest in an education not often afforded to women. From ages five to nine, she boarded with her sister Chrissey at Miss Latham&#x27;s school in Attleborough, from ages nine to thirteen at Mrs. Wallington&#x27;s school in Nuneaton, and from ages thirteen to sixteen at Miss Franklin&#x27;s school in Coventry. At Mrs. Wallington&#x27;s school, she was taught by the evangelical Maria Lewis—to whom her earliest surviving letters are addressed. In the religious atmosphere of the Misses Franklin&#x27;s school, Evans was exposed to a quiet, disciplined belief opposed to evangelicalism.

After age sixteen, Evans had little formal education. Thanks to her father&#x27;s important role on the estate, she was allowed access to the library of Arbury Hall, which greatly aided her self-education and breadth of learning. Her classical education left its mark; Christopher Stray has observed that &quot;George Eliot&#x27;s novels draw heavily on Greek literature (only one of her books can be printed correctly without the use of a Greek typeface), and her themes are often influenced by Greek tragedy&quot;. Her frequent visits to the estate also allowed her to contrast the wealth in which the local landowner lived with the lives of the often much poorer people on the estate, and different lives lived in parallel would reappear in many of her works. The other important early influence in her life was religion. She was brought up within a low church Anglican family, but at that time the Midlands was an area with a growing number of religious dissenters.

=== Move to Coventry ===
In 1836, her mother died and Evans (then 16) returned home to act as housekeeper, though she continued to correspond with her tutor Maria Lewis. When she was 21, her brother Isaac married and took over the family home, so Evans and her father moved to Foleshill near Coventry. The closeness to Coventry society brought new influences, most notably those of Charles and Cara Bray. Charles Bray had become rich as a ribbon manufacturer and had used his wealth in the building of schools and in other philanthropic causes. Evans, who had been struggling with religious doubts for some time, became intimate friends with the radical, free-thinking Brays, who had a casual view of marital obligations and the Brays&#x27; &quot;Rosehill&quot; home was a haven for people who held and debated radical views. The people whom the young woman met at the Brays&#x27; house included Robert Owen, Herbert Spencer, Harriet Martineau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Through this society Evans was introduced to more liberal and agnostic theologies and to writers such as David Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach, who cast doubt on the literal truth of Biblical texts. In fact, her first major literary work was an English translation of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Das Leben Jesu kritisch bearbeitet&quot; as &quot;The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined&quot; (1846), which she completed after it had been left incomplete by Elizabeth &quot;Rufa&quot; Brabant, another member of the &quot;Rosehill Circle&quot;.

The Strauss book had caused a sensation in Germany by arguing that the miracles in the New Testament were mythical additions with little basis in fact. Evans&#x27;s translation had a similar effect in England, with the Earl of Shaftesbury calling her translation &quot;the most pestilential book ever vomited out of the jaws of hell.&quot; Later she translated Feuerbach&#x27;s &quot;The Essence of Christianity&quot; (1854). The ideas in these books would have an effect on her own fiction.

As a product of their friendship, Bray published some of Evans&#x27;s own earliest writing, such as reviews, in his newspaper the &quot;Coventry Herald and Observer&quot;. As Evans began to question her own religious faith, her father threatened to throw her out of the house, but his threat was not carried out. Instead, she respectfully attended church and continued to keep house for him until his death in 1849, when she was 30. Five days after her father&#x27;s funeral, she travelled to Switzerland with the Brays. She decided to stay on in Geneva alone, living first on the lake at Plongeon (near the present-day United Nations buildings) and then on the second floor of a house owned by her friends François and Juliet d&#x27;Albert Durade on the rue de Chanoines (now the rue de la Pelisserie). She commented happily that &quot;one feels in a downy nest high up in a good old tree&quot;. Her stay is commemorated by a plaque on the building. While residing there, she read avidly and took long walks in the beautiful Swiss countryside, which was a great inspiration to her. François Durade painted her portrait there as well.

=== Move to London and editorship of the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; ===
On her return to England the following year (1850), she moved to London with the intent of becoming a writer, and she began referring to herself as Marian Evans. She stayed at the house of John Chapman, the radical publisher whom she had met earlier at Rosehill and who had published her Strauss translation. She then joined Chapman&#x27;s &quot;ménage-à-trois&quot; along with his wife and mistress. Chapman had recently purchased the campaigning, left-wing journal &quot;The Westminster Review&quot;. Evans became its assistant editor in 1851 after joining just a year earlier. Evans&#x27;s writings for the paper were comments on her views of society and the Victorian way of thinking. She was sympathetic to the lower classes and criticised organised religion throughout her articles and reviews and commented on contemporary ideas of the time. Much of this was drawn from her own experiences and knowledge and she used this to critique other ideas and organisations. This led to her writing being viewed as authentic and wise but not too obviously opinionated. Evans also focused on the business side of the Review with attempts to change its layout and design. Although Chapman was officially the editor, it was Evans who did most of the work of producing the journal, contributing many essays and reviews beginning with the January 1852 issue and continuing until the end of her employment at the &quot;Review&quot; in the first half of 1854. Eliot sympathized with the 1848 Revolutions throughout continental Europe, and even hoped that the Italians would chase the &quot;odious Austrians&quot; out of Lombardy and that &quot;decayed monarchs&quot; would be pensioned off, although she believed a gradual reformist approach to social problems was best for England.

In 1850–51, Evans attended classes in mathematics at the Ladies College in Bedford Square, later known as Bedford College, London.

=== Relationship with George Henry Lewes ===
The philosopher and critic George Henry Lewes (1817–1878) met Evans in 1851, and by 1854 they had decided to live together. Lewes was already married to Agnes Jervis, although in an open marriage. In addition to the three children they had together, Agnes also had four children by Thornton Leigh Hunt. In July 1854, Lewes and Evans travelled to Weimar and Berlin together for the purpose of research. Before going to Germany, Evans continued her theological work with a translation of Feuerbach&#x27;s &quot;The Essence of Christianity&quot;, and while abroad she wrote essays and worked on her translation of Baruch Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot;, which she completed in 1856, but which was not published in her lifetime because the prospective publisher refused to pay the requested £75. In 1981, Eliot&#x27;s translation of Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot; was finally published by Thomas Deegan, and was determined to be in the public domain in 2018 and published by the &quot;George Eliot Archive&quot;. It has been re-published in 2020 by Princeton University Press.

The trip to Germany also served as a honeymoon for Evans and Lewes, who subsequently considered themselves married. Evans began to refer to Lewes as her husband and to sign her name as Mary Ann Evans Lewes, legally changing her name to Mary Ann Evans Lewes after his death. The refusal to conceal the relationship was contrary to the social conventions of the time, and attracted considerable disapproval.

=== Career in fiction ===

While continuing to contribute pieces to the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;, Evans resolved to become a novelist, and set out a pertinent manifesto in one of her last essays for the &quot;Review&quot;, &quot;Silly Novels by Lady Novelists&quot; (1856). The essay criticised the trivial and ridiculous plots of contemporary fiction written by women. In other essays, she praised the realism of novels that were being written in Europe at the time, an emphasis on realistic storytelling confirmed in her own subsequent fiction. She also adopted a nom-de-plume, George Eliot; as she explained to her biographer J. W. Cross, George was Lewes&#x27;s forename, and Eliot was &quot;a good mouth-filling, easily pronounced word&quot;. Although female authors were published under their own names during her lifetime, she wanted to escape the stereotype of women&#x27;s writing being limited to lighthearted romances or other lighter fare not to be taken very seriously. She also wanted to have her fiction judged separately from her already extensive and widely known work as a translator, editor, and critic. Another factor in her use of a pen name may have been a desire to shield her private life from public scrutiny, thus avoiding the scandal that would have arisen because of her relationship with Lewes, who was married.

In 1857, when she was 37 years of age, &quot;The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton&quot;, the first of the three stories included in &quot;Scenes of Clerical Life&quot;, and the first work of &quot;George Eliot&quot;, was published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. &quot;The Scenes&quot; (published as a 2-volume book in 1858), was well received, and was widely believed to have been written by a country parson, or perhaps the wife of a parson.

Eliot was profoundly influenced by the works of Thomas Carlyle. As early as 1841, she referred to him as &quot;a grand favourite of mine&quot;, and references to him abound in her letters from the 1840s and 1850s. According to University of Victoria professor Lisa Surridge, Carlyle &quot;stimulated Eliot&#x27;s interest in German thought, encouraged her turn from Christian orthodoxy, and shaped her ideas on work, duty, sympathy, and the evolution of the self.&quot; These themes made their way into Evans&#x27;s first complete novel, &quot;Adam Bede&quot; (1859). It was an instant success, and prompted yet more intense curiosity as to the author&#x27;s identity: there was even a pretender to the authorship, one Joseph Liggins. This public interest subsequently led to Mary Anne Evans Lewes&#x27;s acknowledgment that it was she who stood behind the pseudonym George Eliot. &quot;Adam Bede&quot; is known for embracing a realist aesthetic inspired by Dutch visual art.

The revelations about Eliot&#x27;s private life surprised and shocked many of her admiring readers, but this did not affect her popularity as a novelist. Her relationship with Lewes afforded her the encouragement and stability she needed to write fiction, but it would be some time before the couple were accepted into polite society. Acceptance was finally confirmed in 1877 when they were introduced to Princess Louise, the daughter of Queen Victoria. The queen herself was an avid reader of all of Eliot&#x27;s novels and was so impressed with &quot;Adam Bede&quot; that she commissioned the artist Edward Henry Corbould to paint scenes from the book.

When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Eliot expressed sympathy for the Union cause, something which historians have attributed to her abolitionist sympathies. In 1868, she supported philosopher Richard Congreve&#x27;s protests against governmental policies in Ireland and had a positive view of the growing movement in support of Irish home rule.

She was influenced by the writings of John Stuart Mill and read all of his major works as they were published. In Mill&#x27;s &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot; (1869) she judged the second chapter excoriating the laws which oppress married women &quot;excellent.&quot; She was supportive of Mill&#x27;s parliamentary run, but believed that the electorate was unlikely to vote for a philosopher and was surprised when he won. While Mill served in parliament, she expressed her agreement with his efforts on behalf of female suffrage, being &quot;inclined to hope for much good from the serious presentation of women&#x27;s claims before Parliament.&quot; In a letter to John Morley, she declared her support for plans &quot;which held out reasonable promise of tending to establish as far as possible an equivalence of advantage for the two sexes, as to education and the possibilities of free development&quot;, and dismissed appeals to nature in explaining women&#x27;s lower status. In 1870, she responded enthusiastically to Lady Amberley&#x27;s feminist lecture on the claims of women for education, occupations, equality in marriage, and child custody. It would be wrong to assume that the female protagonists of her works can be considered &quot;feminist&quot;, with the sole exception perhaps of Romola de&#x27; Bardi, who resolutely rejects the State and Church obligations of her time.

After the success of &quot;Adam Bede&quot;, Eliot continued to write popular novels for the next fifteen years. Within a year of completing &quot;Adam Bede&quot;, she finished &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot;, dedicating the manuscript: &quot;To my beloved husband, George Henry Lewes, I give this MS. of my third book, written in the sixth year of our life together, at Holly Lodge, South Field, Wandsworth, and finished 21 March 1860.&quot; &quot;Silas Marner&quot; (1861) and &quot;Romola&quot; (1863) soon followed, and later &quot;Felix Holt, the Radical&quot; (1866) and her most acclaimed novel, &quot;Middlemarch&quot; (1871–1872). Her last novel was &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot;, published in 1876, after which she and Lewes moved to Witley, Surrey. By this time Lewes&#x27;s health was failing, and he died two years later, on 30 November 1878. Eliot spent the next six months editing Lewes&#x27;s final work, &quot;Life and Mind&quot;, for publication, and found solace and companionship with longtime friend and financial adviser John Walter Cross, a Scottish commission agent 20 years her junior, whose mother had recently died.

=== Marriage to John Cross and death ===
On 16 May 1880, eighteen months after Lewes&#x27; death, Eliot married John Walter Cross (1840–1924) and again changed her name, this time to Mary Ann Cross. While the marriage courted some controversy due to the 21 year age differences, it pleased her brother Isaac that she was married in this relationship. He had broken off relations with her when she had begun to live with Lewes, and now sent congratulations. While the couple were honeymooning in Venice, Cross, in a suicide attempt, jumped from the hotel balcony into the Grand Canal. He survived, and the newlyweds returned to England. They moved to a new house in Chelsea, but Eliot fell ill with a throat infection. This, coupled with the kidney disease with which she had been afflicted for several years, led to her death on 22 December 1880 at the age of 61.

Due to her denial of the Christian faith and her relationship with Lewes, Eliot was not buried in Westminster Abbey. She was instead interred in Highgate Cemetery (East), Highgate, London, in the area reserved for political and religious dissenters and agnostics, beside the love of her life, George Henry Lewes. The graves of Karl Marx and her friend Herbert Spencer are nearby. In 1980, on the centenary of her death, a memorial stone was established for her in the Poets&#x27; Corner between W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas, with a quote from &quot;Scenes of Clerical Life&quot;: &quot;The first condition of human goodness is something to love; the second something to reverence&quot;.

=== Personal appearance ===
George Eliot was considered by contemporaries to be physically unattractive; she herself knew this and made jokes about her appearance in letters to friends. Despite this, numerous acquaintances found that the force of her personality overcame their impression of her appearance. Of his first meeting with her on 9 May 1869, Henry James wrote:

... To begin with she is magnificently ugly — deliciously hideous. She has a low forehead, a dull grey eye, a vast pendulous nose, a huge mouth, full of uneven teeth &amp; a chin &amp; jawbone &quot;qui n&#x27;en finissent pas&quot; [&quot;which never end&quot;] ... Now in this vast ugliness resides a most powerful beauty which, in a very few minutes steals forth &amp; charms the mind, so that you end as I ended, in falling in love with her.
=== Spelling of her name ===

She spelled her name differently at different times. Mary Anne was the spelling used by her father for the baptismal record and she uses this spelling in her earliest letters. Within her family, however, it was spelled Mary Ann. By 1852, she had changed to Marian, but she reverted to Mary Ann in 1880 after she married John Cross. Her memorial stone reads 

== Memorials and tributes ==

Several landmarks in her birthplace of Nuneaton are named in her honour. These include the George Eliot Academy, Middlemarch Junior School, George Eliot Hospital (formerly Nuneaton Emergency Hospital), and George Eliot Road, in Foleshill, Coventry. Also, The Mary Anne Evans Hospice in Nuneaton. A statue of Eliot is in Newdegate Street, Nuneaton, and Nuneaton Museum &amp; Art Gallery has a display of artefacts related to her.
A tunnel boring machine constructing the Bromford Tunnel on High Speed 2 was named in honour of her.

In 2015, a new halls of residence was named after Evans at Royal Holloway University of London, successor to Bedford College, which Evans attended in 1850-1.

==Literary assessment==
Throughout her career, Eliot wrote with a politically astute pen. From &quot;Adam Bede&quot; to &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; and &quot;Silas Marner&quot;, Eliot presented the cases of social outsiders and small-town persecution. &quot;Felix Holt, the Radical&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Jubal&quot; were overtly political, and political crisis is at the heart of &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, in which she presents the stories of a number of inhabitants of a small English town on the eve of the Reform Bill of 1832; the novel is notable for its deep psychological insight and sophisticated character portraits. The roots of her realist philosophy can be found in her review of John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Modern Painters&quot; in &quot;Westminster Review&quot; in 1856. Eliot also expresses proto-Zionist ideas in Daniel Deronda.

Readers in the Victorian era praised her novels for their depictions of rural society. Much of the material for her prose was drawn from her own experience. She shared with Wordsworth the belief that there was much value and beauty to be found in the mundane details of ordinary country life. Eliot did not, however, confine herself to stories of the English countryside. &quot;Romola&quot;, an historical novel set in late fifteenth century Florence, was based on the life of the Italian priest Girolamo Savonarola. In &quot;The Spanish Gypsy&quot;, Eliot made a foray into verse, but her poetry&#x27;s initial popularity has not endured.

Working as a translator, Eliot was exposed to German texts of religious, social, and moral philosophy such as David Friedrich Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Life of Jesus&quot; and Feuerbach&#x27;s &quot;The Essence of Christianity&quot;; also important was her translation from Latin of Jewish-Dutch philosopher Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot;. Elements from these works show up in her fiction, much of which is written with her trademark sense of agnostic humanism. According to Clare Carlisle, who published a new biography on George Eliot in 2023, the overdue publication of Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot; was a real shame, because it could have provided some illuminating cues for understanding the more mature works of the writer. She had taken particular notice of Feuerbach&#x27;s conception of Christianity, positing that our understanding of the nature of the divine was to be found ultimately in the nature of humanity projected onto a divine figure. An example of this philosophy appeared in her novel &quot;Romola&quot;, in which Eliot&#x27;s protagonist displayed a &quot;surprisingly modern readiness to interpret religious language in humanist or secular ethical terms.&quot; Though Eliot herself was not religious, she had respect for religious tradition and its ability to maintain a sense of social order and morality. 
The religious elements in her fiction also owe much to her upbringing, with the experiences of Maggie Tulliver from &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; sharing many similarities with the young Mary Ann Evans. Eliot also faced a quandary similar to that of Silas Marner, whose alienation from the church simultaneously meant his alienation from society. Because Eliot retained a vestigial respect for religion, German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche excoriated her system of morality for figuring sin as a debt that can be expiated through suffering, which he demeaned as characteristic of &quot;little moralistic females à la Eliot.&quot;

She was at her most autobiographical in &quot;Looking Backwards&quot;, part of her final published work &quot;Impressions of Theophrastus Such&quot;. By the time of &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot;, Eliot&#x27;s sales were falling off, and she had faded from public view to some degree. This was not helped by the posthumous biography written by her husband, which portrayed a wonderful, almost saintly, woman totally at odds with the scandalous life people knew she had led. In the 20th century she was championed by a new breed of critics, most notably by Virginia Woolf, who called &quot;Middlemarch&quot; &quot;one of the few English novels written for grown-up people&quot;. In 1994, literary critic Harold Bloom placed Eliot among the most important Western writers of all time. In a 2007 authors&#x27; poll by &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Middlemarch&quot; was voted the tenth greatest literary work ever written. In 2015, writers from outside the UK voted it first among all British novels &quot;by a landslide&quot;. The various film and television adaptations of Eliot&#x27;s books have re-introduced her to the wider reading public.

<doc id="13050" wikidata="Q1555294" url="?curid=13050" title="Guru Meditation">
<text>Guru Meditation is an error notice originally displayed by the Amiga computer when it crashes. It is now also used by Varnish, a software component used by many content-heavy websites. This has led to many internet users seeing a &quot;Guru Meditation&quot; message (or the variant &quot;Guru Mediation&quot;) when these websites suffer crashes or other issues. It is analogous to the &quot;Blue Screen of Death&quot; in Microsoft Windows operating systems, or a kernel panic in Unix. 

It has also been used as a message for unrecoverable errors in software packages such as VirtualBox and other operating systems (see Legacy section below).

==Origins==
The term &quot;Guru Meditation Error&quot; originated as an in-house joke in Amiga&#x27;s early days. The company had a product called the &quot;Joyboard&quot; for the Atari 2600 home video game console, a game controller much like a joystick but operated by the feet, similar to the Wii Balance Board. Early in the development of the Amiga computer operating system, the company&#x27;s developers became so frustrated with the system&#x27;s frequent crashes that, as a relaxation technique, a game was developed where a person would sit cross-legged on the Joyboard, resembling an Indian guru. The player tried to remain extremely still; the winner of the game stayed still the longest. If the player moved too much, a &quot;guru meditation&quot; error occurred.

==Description of &quot;Guru Meditation&quot; errors on the Amiga==

The alert occurred when there was a fatal problem with the system. If the system had no means of recovery, it could display the alert, even in systems with numerous critical flaws. In extreme cases, the alert could even be displayed if the system&#x27;s memory was completely exhausted.

The text of the alert messages was completely baffling to most users. Only highly technically adept Amiga users would know, for example, that exception 3 was an address error, and meant the program was accessing a word on an unaligned boundary. Users without this specialized knowledge would have no recourse but to look for a &quot;Guru&quot; or to simply reboot the machine and hope for the best.

==Technical description (Amiga)== 

When a Guru Meditation is displayed, the options are to reboot by pressing the left mouse button, or to invoke ROMWack by pressing the right mouse button or to manually reboot. ROMWack is a minimalist debugger built into the operating system which is accessible by connecting a 9600 bit/s terminal to the serial port.

The alert itself appears as a black rectangular box located in the upper portion of the screen. Its border and text are red for a normal Guru Meditation, or green/yellow for a Recoverable Alert, another kind of Guru Meditation. The screen may go black, but the power LEDs always alternates between full and half-brightness for a few seconds before the alert appears. In AmigaOS 1.x, programmed in ROMs known as Kickstart 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, the errors are always red. In AmigaOS 2.x and 3.x, recoverable alerts are yellow, except for some very early versions of 2.x where they were green.

Dead-end alerts are always red and terminal in all OS versions except in a rare series of events, as in when a deprecated Kickstart (example: 1.1) program conditionally boots from disk on a more advanced Kickstart 3.x ROM Amiga running in compatibility mode (therefore eschewing the on-disk OS) and crashes with a red Guru Meditation but subsequently restores itself by pressing the left mouse button, the newer Kickstart recognizing an inadvised low level chipset call for the older ROM directly poking the hardware, and addressing it.

The error is displayed as two fields, separated by a period. The format is codice_1 in case of a CPU error, or codice_2 in case of a system software error. The first field is either the Motorola 68000 exception number that occurred (if a CPU error occurs) or an internal error identifier (such as an &quot;Out of Memory&quot; code), in case of a system software error. The second can be the address of a &quot;Task&quot; structure, or the address of a memory block whose allocation or deallocation failed. It is never the address of the code that caused the error. If the cause of the crash is uncertain, this number is rendered as codice_3, which stands for &quot;HELP&quot; in hexadecimal ASCII characters (48=H, 45=E, 4C=L, 50=P).

===Guru Meditation handler===
There was a commercially available error handler for AmigaOS, before version 2.04, called GOMF (Get Outta My Face) made by Hypertek/Silicon Springs Development corp. It was able to deal with many kinds of errors and gave the user a choice to either remove the offending process and associated screen, or allow the machine to show the Guru Meditation. In many cases, removal of the offending process gave one the choice to save one&#x27;s data and exit running programs before rebooting the system. When the damage was not extensive, one was able to continue using the machine. However, it did not save the user from all errors, as one may have still seen this error occasionally.

===Recoverable Alerts===
Recoverable Alerts are non-critical crashes in the computer system. In most cases, it is possible to resume work and save files after a Recoverable Alert, while a normal, red Guru Meditation always results in an immediate reboot.

It is, however, still recommended to reboot as soon as possible after encountering a Recoverable Alert, because the system may be in an unpredictable state that can cause data corruption.

===System software error codes===
The first byte specifies the area of the system affected. The top bit will be set if the error is a dead end alert.

==Legacy==

* AmigaOS versions 4.0 and onwards replaced &quot;Guru Meditation&quot; with &quot;Grim Reaper&quot;, but briefly mentions the Guru Meditation number in the prompt box.
* MorphOS displays an &quot;Application Is &quot;Meditating&quot;&quot; error message. Attempting to close the application may revive the operating system, but restarting is still recommended.
* Varnish references Guru Meditation for severe errors.
* The ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers will display &quot;Guru Meditation Error: Core X panic&#x27;ed&quot; (where X is 0 or 1 depending on which core crashed) along with a core dump and stack trace.
* VirtualBox uses the term &quot;Guru Meditation&quot; for severe errors in the virtual machine monitor, for example caused by a triple fault in the virtual machine.
* E23 displays a &quot;Guru Meditation&quot; and restarts when severe errors occur.
* Some Nintendo DS homebrew titles display a &quot;Guru Meditation&quot; error when an issue occurs, likely when the title crashes.
* OpenMediaVault has Guru Meditation like errors (such as with session timeouts) as well as emulating the Amiga&#x27;s pointer and wait pointer (when executing a task) in the web interface

<text>Gnumeric is a spreadsheet program that is part of the GNOME Free Software Desktop Project. Gnumeric version 1.0 was released on 31 December 2001. Gnumeric is distributed as free software under the GNU General Public License; it is intended to replace proprietary spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel. Gnumeric was created and developed by Miguel de Icaza, but he has since moved on to other projects. The maintainer was Jody Goldberg.

==Features==
Gnumeric has the ability to import and export data in several file formats, including CSV, Microsoft Excel (write support for the more recent codice_1 format is incomplete), Microsoft Works spreadsheets (codice_2), HTML, LaTeX, Lotus 1-2-3, OpenDocument and Quattro Pro; its native format is the &quot;Gnumeric file format&quot; (codice_3 or codice_4), an XML file compressed with gzip. It includes all of the spreadsheet functions of the North American edition of Microsoft Excel and many functions unique to Gnumeric. Pivot tables and Visual Basic for Applications macros are not yet supported.

Gnumeric&#x27;s accuracy has helped it to establish a niche for statistical analysis and other scientific tasks. For improving the accuracy of Gnumeric, the developers are cooperating with the R Project.

Gnumeric has an interface for the creation and editing of graphs different from other spreadsheet software. For editing a graph, Gnumeric displays a window where all the elements of the graph are listed. Other spreadsheet programs typically require the user to select the individual elements of the graph in the graph itself in order to edit them.

<doc id="13052" wikidata="Q464113" url="?curid=13052" title="GNU Debugger">
<text>The GNU Debugger (GDB) is a portable debugger that runs on many Unix-like systems and works for many programming languages, including Ada, Assembly, C, C++, D, Fortran, Haskell, Go, Objective-C, OpenCL C, Modula-2, Pascal, Rust, and partially others.

==History==
GDB was first written by Richard Stallman in 1986 as part of his GNU system, after his GNU Emacs was &quot;reasonably stable&quot;. GDB is free software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It was modeled after the DBX debugger, which came with Berkeley Unix distributions.

From 1990 to 1993 it was maintained by John Gilmore. Now it is maintained by the GDB Steering Committee which is appointed by the Free Software Foundation.

==Technical details==
===Features===
GDB offers extensive facilities for tracing and altering the execution of computer programs. The user can monitor and modify the values of programs&#x27; internal variables, and even call functions independently of the program&#x27;s normal behavior.

GDB target processors (as of 2003) include: Alpha, ARM, AVR, H8/300, Altera Nios/Nios II, System/370, System 390, x86 and its 64-bit extension x86-64, IA-64 &quot;Itanium&quot;, Motorola 68000, MIPS, PA-RISC, PowerPC, RISC-V, SuperH, SPARC, and VAX. Lesser-known target processors supported in the standard release have included A29K, ARC, ETRAX CRIS, D10V, D30V, FR-30, FR-V, Intel i960, 68HC11, Motorola 88000, MCORE, MN10200, MN10300, NS32K, Stormy16, and Z8000. (Newer releases will likely not support some of these.) GDB has compiled-in simulators for even lesser-known target processors such like M32R or V850.

GDB is still actively being developed. As of version 7.0 new features include support for Python scripting and as of version 7.8 GNU Guile scripting as well. Since version 7.0, support for &quot;reversible debugging&quot; — allowing a debugging session to step backward, much like rewinding a crashed program to see what happened — is available.

===Remote debugging===
GDB offers a &quot;remote&quot; mode often used when debugging embedded systems. Remote operation is when GDB runs on one machine and the program being debugged runs on another. GDB can communicate to the remote &quot;stub&quot; that understands GDB protocol through a serial device or TCP/IP. A stub program can be created by linking to the appropriate stub files provided with GDB, which implement the target side of the communication protocol. Alternatively, gdbserver can be used to remotely debug the program without needing to change it in any way.

The same mode is also used by KGDB for debugging a running Linux kernel on the source level with gdb. With KGDB, kernel developers can debug a kernel in much the same way as they debug application programs. It makes it possible to place breakpoints in kernel code, step through the code, and observe variables. On architectures where hardware debugging registers are available, watchpoints can be set which trigger breakpoints when specified memory addresses are executed or accessed. KGDB requires an additional machine which is connected to the machine to be debugged using a serial cable or Ethernet. On FreeBSD, it is also possible to debug using FireWire direct memory access (DMA).

===Graphical user interface===
The debugger does not contain its own graphical user interface, and defaults to a command-line interface, although it does contain a text user interface. Several front-ends have been built for it, such as UltraGDB, Xxgdb, Data Display Debugger (DDD), Nemiver, KDbg, the Xcode debugger, GDBtk/Insight, Gede , Seer , and HP Wildebeest Debugger GUI (WDB GUI). IDEs such as Codelite, , Dev-C++, Geany, GNAT Programming Studio (GPS), KDevelop, Qt Creator, Lazarus, MonoDevelop, Eclipse, NetBeans, and Visual Studio can interface with GDB. GNU Emacs has a &quot;GUD mode&quot; and tools for Vim exist (e.g. clewn). These offer facilities similar to debuggers found in IDEs.

Some other debugging tools have been designed to work with GDB, such as memory leak detectors.

===Internals ===
GDB uses a system call named ptrace (the name is an abbreviation of &quot;process trace&quot;) to observe and control the execution of another process, and examine and change the process&#x27; memory and registers.

A breakpoint is implemented by replacing an instruction at a given memory address with another special instruction. Executing breakpoint instruction causes SIGTRAP.

==Examples of commands==
==An example session==
Consider the following source-code written in C:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

size_t foo_len( const char *s )
 return strlen( s );

int main( int argc, char *argv[] )
 const char *a = NULL;

 printf( &quot;size of a = %lu\n&quot;, foo_len(a) );

 exit( 0 );


Using the GCC compiler on Linux, the code above must be compiled using the codice_1 flag in order to include appropriate debug information on the binary generated, thus making it possible to inspect it using GDB. Assuming that the file containing the code above is named codice_2, the command for the compilation could be:

$ gcc example.c -Og -g -o example

And the binary can now be run:

$ ./example
Segmentation fault
Since the example code, when executed, generates a segmentation fault, GDB can be used to inspect the problem.

$ gdb ./example

0x0000000000400527 in foo_len (s=0x0) at example.c:7

(gdb) print s

The problem is present in line 7, and occurs when calling the function codice_3 (because its argument, codice_4, is codice_5).
Depending on the implementation of strlen (inline or not), the output can be different, e.g.:

#2 0x0804845a in main (argc=&lt;optimized out&gt;, argv=&lt;optimized out&gt;) at example.c:14
To fix the problem, the variable codice_6 (in the function codice_7) must contain a valid string. Here is a fixed version of the code:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

size_t foo_len( const char *s )
 return strlen(s);

int main( int argc, char *argv[] )
 const char *a = &quot;This is a test string&quot;;

 printf( &quot;size of a = %lu\n&quot;, foo_len(a) );

 exit( 0 );


Recompiling and running the executable again inside GDB now gives a correct result:

<text>Galeon is a discontinued Gecko-based web browser that was created by Marco Pesenti Gritti with the goal of delivering a consistent browsing experience to GNOME desktop environment. It gained some popularity in the early 2000s due to its speed, flexibility in configuration and features.

The disagreement over the future of Galeon split the development team in 2002, which resulted in the departure of the browser&#x27;s initial author and several other developers. This event marked the beginning of the browser&#x27;s popularity decline, which led to its discontinuation in September 2008. Some of Galeon&#x27;s features were subsequently ported to Epiphany (now called Web) – the descendant of Galeon.

== Features ==
Galeon made use of Gecko&#x27;s features including configuration options and standards support. Apart from that, Galeon had several features that were uncommon in browsers at that time:
*mouse gestures
*configurable user agent string
*configurable display of favicons
*customizable toolbars
*configurable position of tab bar
*smart bookmarks with search history
*ability to specify own fonts and colors for web content
*configurable MIME types handler
*configurable history expiry
*page zooming

== Development history ==
The project was started by Marco Pesenti Gritti with the goal of creating a web browser that would be fast and consistent with the GNOME desktop environment. The first public version (Galeon 0.6) was released in June 2000.

=== On the rise ===
The first releases of Galeon were criticised for lack of such basic features as cookie and proxy support, though the browser added some features with every release. Version 1.2 of Galeon introduced many new features that drew attention of the general public.

At the time of Galeon&#x27;s creation, the most popular Linux browsers, including Netscape and Mozilla, were large multi-functional programs. This made them slow to start and often impractical due to their high memory usage and processor requirements. Opera was somewhat faster, but it was proprietary software distributed in trialware and adware versions, both of which lacked some of the functionality of the Microsoft Windows version.

Galeon was widely seen as one of the best Linux browsers available. The polls revealed the substantial usage share of Galeon, though its popularity was regarded as owing to lack of stability evident in Mozilla&#x27;s browsers.

=== Split of the development team ===

With the release of new version of the GTK+ widget toolkit, which was used to construct the user interface of Galeon, the team decided to write a new version of Galeon from scratch. At the same time the GNOME project has adopted its new human interface guidelines, which promoted simplicity and uniform design. The Galeon team had differing opinions on the new guidelines. The author and lead developer, Marco Pesenti Gritti, endorsed them and saw the rewrite as an opportunity to make Galeon simpler. Many other developers believed that reducing the number of preferences and simplifying the user interface would harm the project.

In November 2002, as the result of several discussions on the topic Gritti made the decision to cease his work in Galeon and fork the project and started development of a HIG-compliant web browser he called &quot;Epiphany&quot; (now known as Web).

=== After the split ===
As Gritti no longer controlled the development of Galeon, the previous functionality was restored in subsequent releases and some new features were added, though development got slow after the split. At the same time the rising popularity of Firefox, its status of the default browser in major distribution and the overwhelming number of its extensions led to decline of Galeon&#x27;s user base.

Eventually the Galeon developers announced plans to halt development of Galeon, saying &quot;the current approach is unsustainable&quot; regarding the resources required to maintain it. Instead, they planned to develop a set of extensions for Epiphany to provide similar functionality.

===Persistence===
Even after development ceased in September 2008, the browser remained popular and in December 2011 was still available in some Linux distribution&#x27;s repositories, such as Debian 6 Squeeze, although it was not part of Debian 7 Wheezy.

== Reception ==
Galeon was praised for its customizability and speed, as compared to Netscape Navigator and Firefox, though Konqueror and Opera were still faster on older hardware. Galeon was noted for its session handling and crash recovery.

In November 2002, OSNews conducted a poll to determine the most popular Gecko-based browser, which included several browsers for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, but didn&#x27;t include Netscape Navigator and Mozilla Suite. The Linux-only Galeon was the second most popular, after cross-platform Firefox, at that time known as Phoenix.

Critics noted Galeon&#x27;s tricky plugin installation.

<text>The Gatling gun is a rapid-firing multiple-barrel firearm invented in 1861 by Richard Jordan Gatling. It is an early machine gun and a forerunner of the modern electric motor-driven rotary cannon.

The Gatling gun&#x27;s operation centered on a cyclic multi-barrel design which facilitated cooling and synchronized the firing-reloading sequence. As the handwheel is cranked, the barrels rotate, and each barrel sequentially loads a single cartridge from a top-mounted magazine, fires off the shot when it reaches a set position (usually at 4 o&#x27;clock), then ejects the spent casing out of the left side at the bottom, after which the barrel is empty and allowed to cool until rotated back to the top position and gravity-fed another new round. This configuration eliminated the need for a single reciprocating bolt design and allowed higher rates of fire to be achieved without the barrels overheating quickly.

One of the best-known early rapid-fire firearms, the Gatling gun saw occasional use by the U.S. forces during the American Civil War, which was the first time it was employed in combat. It was later used in numerous military conflicts, including the Boshin War, the Anglo-Zulu War, and the assault on San Juan Hill during the Spanish–American War. It was also used by the Pennsylvania militia in episodes of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, specifically in Pittsburgh. Gatling guns were also mounted aboard ships.

== Design ==
The Gatling gun is operated by a hand-crank mechanism, with six barrels revolving around a central shaft (although some models had as many as ten). Each barrel fires once per revolution at about the same position. The barrels, a carrier, and a lock cylinder were separate and all mounted on a solid plate revolving around a central shaft, mounted on an oblong fixed frame. Turning the crank rotated the shaft. The carrier was grooved and the lock cylinder was drilled with holes corresponding to the barrels.

The casing was partitioned, and through this opening, the barrel shaft was journaled. In front of the casing was a cam with spiral surfaces. The cam imparted a reciprocating motion to the locks when the gun rotated. Also in the casing was a cocking ring with projections to cock and fire the gun. Each barrel had a single lock, working in the lock cylinder on a line with the barrel. The lock cylinder was encased and joined to the frame. Early models had a fibrous matting stuffed in among the barrels, which could be soaked with water to cool the barrels down. Later models eliminated the matting jacketing as being unnecessary.

Cartridges, held in a hopper, dropped individually into the grooves of the carrier. The lock was simultaneously forced by the cam to move forward and load the cartridge, and when the cam was at its highest point, the cocking ring freed the lock and fired the cartridge. After the cartridge was fired the continuing action of the cam drew back the lock bringing with it the spent casing which then dropped to the ground.

The grouped barrel concept had been explored by inventors since the 18th century, but poor engineering and the lack of a unitary cartridge made previous designs unsuccessful. The initial Gatling gun design used self-contained, reloadable steel cylinders with a chamber holding a ball and black-powder charge, and a percussion cap on one end. As the barrels rotated, these steel cylinders dropped into place, were fired, and were then ejected from the gun. The innovative features of the Gatling gun were its independent firing mechanism for each barrel and the simultaneous action of the locks, barrels, carrier, and breech.

The ammunition that Gatling eventually implemented was a paper cartridge charged with black powder and primed with a percussion cap because self-contained brass cartridges were not yet fully developed and available. The shells were gravity-fed into the breech through a hopper or simple box &quot;magazine&quot; with an unsprung gravity follower on top of the gun. Each barrel had its own firing mechanism.

Despite self-contained brass cartridges replacing the paper cartridge in the 1860s, it wasn&#x27;t until the Model 1881 that Gatling switched to the &#x27;Bruce&#x27;-style feed system (U.S. Patents 247,158 and 343,532) that accepted two rows of .45-70 cartridges. While one row was being fed into the gun, the other could be reloaded, thus allowing sustained fire. The final gun required four operators. By 1886, the gun was capable of firing more than 400 rounds per minute.

The smallest-caliber gun also had a Broadwell drum feed in place of the curved box of the other guns. The drum, named after L. W. Broadwell, an agent for Gatling&#x27;s company, comprised twenty stacks of rounds arranged around a central axis, like the spokes of a wheel, each holding twenty cartridges with the bullet noses oriented toward the central axis. This invention was patented in U. S. 110,338. As each stack emptied, the drum was manually rotated to bring a new stack into use until all 400 rounds had been fired. A more common variant had 240 rounds in twenty stands of fifteen.

By 1893, the Gatling was adapted to take the new .30 Army smokeless cartridge. The new M1893 guns featured six barrels, later increased to ten barrels, and were capable of a maximum (initial) rate of fire of 800–900 rounds per minute, though 600 rpm was recommended for continuous fire. Dr. Gatling later used examples of the M1893 powered by electric motor and belt to drive the crank. Tests demonstrated the electric Gatling could fire bursts of up to 1,500 rpm.

The M1893, with minor revisions, became the M1895, and 94 guns were produced for the U.S. Army by Colt. Four M1895 Gatlings under Lt. John H. Parker saw considerable combat during the Santiago campaign in Cuba in 1898. The M1895 was designed to accept only the Bruce feeder. All previous models were unpainted, but the M1895 was painted olive drab green, with some parts left blued.

The Model 1900 was very similar to the model 1895, but with only a few components finished in O.D. green. The U.S. Army purchased several M1900s. All Gatling Models 1895–1903 could be mounted on an armored field carriage. In 1903, the Army converted its M1900 guns into .30 Army to fit the new .30-03 cartridge (standardized for the M1903 Springfield rifle) as the M1903. The later M1903-&#x27;06 was an M1903 converted to .30-06. This conversion was principally carried out at the Army&#x27;s Springfield Armory arsenal repair shops. All models of Gatling guns were declared obsolete by the U.S. military in 1911, after 45 years of service.

The original Gatling gun was a field weapon that used multiple rotating barrels turned by a hand crank, and firing loose (no links or belt) metal cartridge ammunition using a gravity feed system from a hopper. The Gatling gun&#x27;s innovation lay in the use of multiple barrels to limit overheating, a rotating mechanism, and a gravity-feed reloading system, which allowed unskilled operators to achieve a relatively high rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute.

Although the first Gatling gun was capable of firing continuously, it required a person to crank it; therefore it was not a true automatic weapon. The Maxim gun, invented and patented in 1883, was the first true fully automatic weapon, making use of the fired projectile&#x27;s recoil force to reload the weapon. Nonetheless, the Gatling gun represented a huge leap in firearm technology.

Before the Gatling gun, the only weapons available to military forces capable of firing many projectiles in a short period of time were mass-firing volley weapons, like the Belgian and French mitrailleuse of the 1860s and 1870s, and field cannons firing canister shot, much like an upsized shotgun. The latter was widely used during and after the Napoleonic Wars. Although the maximum rate of fire was increased by firing multiple projectiles simultaneously, these weapons still needed to be reloaded after each discharge, which for multi-barrel systems like the &quot;mitrailleuse&quot; was cumbersome and time-consuming. This negated much of the advantage of their high rate of fire per discharge, making them much less powerful on the battlefield. In comparison, the Gatling gun offered a rapid and continuous rate of fire without having to be manually reloaded by opening the breech.

Early multi-barrel guns were approximately the size and weight of artillery pieces and were often perceived as a replacement for cannons firing grapeshot or canister shot. Compared with earlier weapons such as the &quot;mitrailleuse,&quot; which required manual reloading, the Gatling gun was more reliable and easier to operate and had a lower, but continuous rate of fire. The large wheels required to move these guns around required a high firing position, which increased the vulnerability of their crews.

Sustained firing of black powder cartridges generated a cloud of smoke, making concealment impossible until smokeless powder became available in the late 19th century. When operators were firing Gatling guns against troops of industrialized nations, they were at risk, being vulnerable to artillery they could not reach and snipers they could not see.

== History ==

The Gatling gun was designed by the American inventor Richard J. Gatling in 1861 and patented on November 4, 1862. Gatling wrote that he created it to reduce the size of armies and so reduce the number of deaths by combat and disease.
=== United States and South America ===
The US Army adopted Gatling guns in several calibers, including .42 caliber, .45-70, .50 caliber, 1 inch, and (M1893 and later) .30 Army, with conversions of M1900 weapons to .30-03 and .30-06. The .45-70 weapon was also mounted on some US Navy ships of the 1880s and 1890s.

British manufacturer James George Accles, previously employed by Colt 1867–1886, developed a modified Gatling gun circa 1888 known as the Accles Machine Gun. Circa 1895 the American Ordnance Company acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute this weapon in the Americas. It was trialed by the US Navy in December 1895, and was said to be the only weapon to complete the trial out of five competing weapons, but was apparently not adopted by US forces.
The Gatling gun was first used in warfare during the American Civil War. Twelve of the guns were purchased personally by Union commanders and used in the trenches during the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia (June 1864—April 1865). Eight other Gatling guns were fitted on gunboats. The gun was not accepted by the American Army until 1866 when a sales representative of the manufacturing company demonstrated it in combat.

On July 17, 1863, Gatling guns were purportedly used to overawe New York anti-draft rioters. Two were brought by a Pennsylvania National Guard unit from Philadelphia to use against strikers in Pittsburgh.

Gatling guns were famously &quot;not&quot; used at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, also known as &quot;Custer&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;, when Gen. George Armstrong Custer chose not to bring Gatling guns with his main force.

In April 1867, a Gatling gun was purchased for the Argentine Army by minister Domingo F. Sarmiento under instructions from president Bartolomé Mitre.

Captain Luis Germán Astete of the Peruvian Navy took with him dozens of Gatling guns from the United States to Peru in December 1879 during the Peru-Chile War of the Pacific. Gatling guns were used by the Peruvian Navy and Army, especially in the Battle of Tacna (May 1880) and the Battle of San Juan (January 1881) against the invading Chilean Army.

In 1888 the SS Ozama smuggled a number of Gatling guns into Haiti

In 1907 Gatling guns were used by Nicaragua in the battle of Namasique, largely manned by American mercenaries

Gatling guns were kept in store by coal companies and used during the Battle of Blair Mountain; In September 1 a group of miners looted one of these guns and assaulted a spot called Craddock Fork. Opposing forces fought back with a machine gun, but after three hours of heavy fire, their weapon jammed. The miners surged forward and briefly broke the defensive line, but were repulsed by another machine gun nest located further up the ridge.

=== Africa and Asia ===

The Gatling gun was used most successfully to expand European colonial empires by defeating indigenous warriors mounting massed attacks, including the Zulu, the Bedouin, and the Mahdists. Imperial Russia purchased 400 Gatling guns and used them against Turkmen cavalry and other nomads of central Asia. The British Army first deployed the Gatling gun in 1873-74 during the Anglo-Ashanti wars, and extensively during the last actions of the 1879 Anglo-Zulu war. The Royal Navy used Gatling guns during the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War.

Gatling guns were used by Egyptian forces both on sea and land, and saw combat in Sudan and Abyssinia. Isma&#x27;il Pasha ordered 120 Colt 1865 six-barrel Gatling guns; after being convinced by Shahine Pasha who witnessed Gatling gun trials at Shoeburyness in 1866. In 1872 a few &quot;camel&quot; guns were purchased, these were smaller and used a tripod instead of the carriage. During the Siege of Khartoum an Egyptian Gatling gun aided by a telescope was able to target Sudanese artillery crews from a distance of 2,000 yards.

Gatling guns were imported by some states in Nigeria. They were used during the Kalabari Civil war of 1879–83, the Abbi House bought one from King Jaja of Opobo and it may have been used in canoe warfare. The Ijesha used a Gatling gun against the Ibadan during the early 1880s. In 1882 the Bonny used a Gatling gun during an attack on New Calabar.

By 1880 Siam had imported an unknown number of Gatlings. By 1885 the kingdom had a Gatling Gun regiment of 600 men; those weapons were possibly used in the Haw Wars. They were also seen among Prince Bigit&#x27;s escort in 1886.

The Korean Empire possessed a number of Gatlings. Six had been imported in 1884, by 1891 it had a battery of fourteen guns and in 1894 the army&#x27;s two American drilled regiments had as many as 40 Gatlings and practiced regularly (Supposedly because the noise pleased Emperor Gojong). Some of them were deployed to defend the approaches of the capital during the Donghak Rebellion, but there is no evidence they saw combat.

=== British North America ===

Lieutenant Arthur L. Howard of the Connecticut National Guard had an interest in the company manufacturing Gatling guns and took a personally owned Gatling gun to the District of Saskatchewan, Canada, in 1885 for use with the Canadian military against Métis and First Nations rebels during Louis Riel&#x27;s North-West Rebellion.

=== Spanish–American War ===
Because of infighting within army ordnance, Gatling guns were used by the U.S. Army during the Spanish–American War. A four-gun battery of Model 1895 ten-barrel Gatling guns in .30 Army, made by Colt&#x27;s Arms Company, was formed into a separate detachment led by Lt. John &quot;Gatling Gun&quot; Parker. The detachment proved very effective, supporting the advance of American forces at the Battle of San Juan Hill. Three of the Gatlings with swivel mountings were used with great success against the Spanish defenders. During the American charge up San Juan and Kettle hills, the three guns fired a total of 18,000 .30 Army rounds in minutes (an average of over 700 rounds per minute per gun of continuous fire) against Spanish troop positions along the crest of both hills, causing significant casualties.

Despite this successful deployment, the Gatling&#x27;s weight and cumbersome artillery carriage hindered its ability to keep up with infantry forces over difficult ground, particularly in Cuba, where roads were often little more than jungle footpaths. By this time, the U.S. Marines had been issued the modern tripod-mounted M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun using the 6mm Lee Navy round, which they employed to defeat the Spanish infantry at the battle of Cuzco Wells.

=== Philippine–American War ===

Gatling guns were used by the U.S. Army during the Philippine–American War.

One such instance was during the Battle of San Jacinto (1899) () which was fought on November 11, 1899, in San Jacinto in the Philippines, between Philippine Republican Army soldiers and American troops.

The Gatling&#x27;s weight and artillery carriage hindered its ability to keep up with American troops over uneven terrain, particularly in the Philippines, where outside the cities there were heavily foliaged forests and steep mountain paths.

== Further development ==
After the Gatling gun was replaced in service by newer recoil or gas-operated weapons, the approach of using multiple externally powered rotating barrels fell into disuse for many decades. However, some examples were developed during the interwar years, but only existed as prototypes or were rarely used. The concept resurfaced after World War II with the development of the Minigun and the M61 Vulcan. Other versions of the Gatling gun were built from the late 20th century to the present, the largest of these being the 30mm GAU-8 Avenger autocannon as used on the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II.

<text>East Germany was a country in Central Europe from its formation on 7 October 1949 until its reunification with West Germany (FRG) on 3 October 1990. Until 1989, it was generally viewed as a communist state and described itself as a socialist &quot;workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; state&quot;. The economy of the country was centrally planned and state-owned. Although the GDR had to pay substantial war reparations to the Soviets, its economy became the most successful in the Eastern Bloc.

Before its establishment, the country&#x27;s territory was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the Berlin Declaration abolishing German sovereignty in World War II. The Potsdam Agreement established the Soviet-occupied zone, bounded on the east by the Oder–Neiße line. The GDR was dominated by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), a communist party, before being democratized and liberalized in 1989 as a result of the pressure against communist governments brought by the revolutions of 1989. This paved the way for East Germany&#x27;s reunification with West Germany. Unlike the government of West Germany, the SED did not see its state as the successor to the German Reich (1871–1945). In 1974, it abolished the goal of unification in the constitution. The SED-ruled GDR was often described as a Soviet satellite state; historians described it as an authoritarian regime.

Geographically the GDR bordered the Baltic Sea to the north, Poland to the east, Czechoslovakia to the southeast, and West Germany to the southwest and west. Internally, the GDR bordered East Berlin, the Soviet sector of Allied-occupied Berlin, which was also administered as the country&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; capital. It also bordered the three sectors occupied by the United States, United Kingdom, and France, known collectively as West Berlin (&quot;de facto&quot; part of the FRG). Emigration to the West was a significant problem; as many emigrants were well-educated young people, this emigration economically weakened the state. In response, the GDR government fortified its inner German border and later built the Berlin Wall in 1961. Many people attempting to flee were killed by border guards or booby traps such as landmines.

In 1989 numerous social, economic, and political forces in the GDR and abroad – one of the most notable being peaceful protests starting in the city of Leipzig – led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the establishment of a government committed to liberalization. The following year, a free and fair election was held in the country, and international negotiations between the four former Allied countries and the two German states commenced. The negotiations led to the signing of the Final Settlement treaty, which replaced the Potsdam Agreement on the status and borders of a future, reunited Germany. The GDR ceased to exist when its five states (&quot;Länder&quot;) joined the Federal Republic of Germany under Article 23 of the Basic Law, and its capital East Berlin united with West Berlin on 3 October 1990. Several of the GDR&#x27;s leaders, notably its last communist leader Egon Krenz, were later prosecuted for offenses committed during the GDR era.

== Naming conventions ==
The official name was (&#x27;German Democratic Republic&#x27;), usually abbreviated to &quot;DDR&quot; (GDR). Both terms were used in East Germany, with increasing usage of the abbreviated form, especially since East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners to be foreigners following the promulgation of its second constitution in 1968. West Germans, the western media, and statesmen initially avoided the official name and its abbreviation, instead using terms like &quot;Ostzone&quot; (&#x27;Eastern Zone&#x27;), (&#x27;Soviet Occupation Zone&#x27;; often abbreviated to &quot;SBZ&quot;), and (&#x27;so-called GDR&#x27;).

In the West, the centre of political power in East Berlin was referred to as &quot;Pankow&quot; (the seat of command of the Soviet forces in Germany was in Karlshorst, a district in the East of Berlin). Over time, however, the abbreviation DDR was also increasingly used colloquially by West Germans and West German media.

When used by West Germans, the term (&#x27;West Germany&#x27;) almost always referred to the geographic region of Western Germany and not to the area within the boundaries of the Federal Republic of Germany. However, this use was not always consistent and West Berliners frequently used the term to denote the Federal Republic. Before World War II, (&#x27;East Germany&#x27;) was used to describe all the territories east of the Elbe (East Elbia), as reflected in the works of sociologist Max Weber and political theorist Carl Schmitt.

== History ==


Explaining the internal impact of the GDR government from the perspective of German history in the long term, historian Gerhard A. Ritter (2002) has argued that two dominant forces defined the East German state: Soviet communism on the one hand, and German traditions filtered through the interwar experiences of German communists on the other. Throughout its existence, the GDR consistently grappled with the influence of the more prosperous West, against which East Germans continually measured their own nation. The notable transformations instituted by the communist regime were particularly evident in the abolition of capitalism, the overhaul of industrial and agricultural sectors, the militarization of society, and the political orientation of both the educational system and the media.

On the other hand, the new regime made relatively few changes in the historically independent domains of the sciences, the engineering professions, the Protestant churches, and in many bourgeois lifestyles. Social policy, says Ritter, became a critical legitimization tool in the last decades and mixed socialist and traditional elements about equally.

=== Origins ===
At the Yalta Conference during World War II, the Alliesthe United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), and the Soviet Union (USSR)agreed to divide defeated Nazi Germany into occupation zones, as well as divide Berlin, the German capital, among the Allied powers. Initially, this meant the formation of three zones of occupation (i.e., American, British, and Soviet). Later, a French zone was carved out of the US and British zones.

=== 1949 establishment ===
The ruling communist party, known as the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), formed on 21 April 1946 from the merger between the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). The two former parties had previously been notorious rivals before the Nazis consolidated all power and criminalized them. Official East German and Soviet histories portrayed this merger as a voluntary pooling of efforts by the socialist parties and as symbolic of the new friendship of German socialists after defeating their common enemy. However, there is much evidence that the merger was more troubled than was commonly portrayed; that the Soviet occupation authorities applied great pressure on the SPD&#x27;s eastern branch to merge with the KPD, and the communists, who held a majority, had virtually total control over policy. The SED remained the ruling party for the entire duration of the East German state. It had close ties with the Soviets, which maintained military forces in East Germany until the dissolution of the Soviet regime in 1991 (Russia continued to maintain forces in the territory of the former East Germany until 1994), with the purpose of countering NATO bases in West Germany.

As West Germany was reorganized and gained independence from its occupiers (1945–1949), the GDR was established in East Germany in October 1949. The emergence of the two sovereign states solidified the 1945 division of Germany. On 10 March 1952, (in what would become known as the &quot;Stalin Note&quot;) the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, issued a proposal to reunify Germany with a policy of neutrality, with no conditions on economic policies and with guarantees for &quot;the rights of man and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, press, religious persuasion, political conviction, and assembly&quot; and free activity of democratic parties and organizations. The West demurred; reunification was not then a priority for the leadership of West Germany, and the NATO powers declined the proposal, asserting that Germany should be able to join NATO and that such a negotiation with the Soviet Union would be seen as a capitulation.

In 1949 the Soviets turned control of East Germany over to the SED, headed by Wilhelm Pieck (1876–1960), who became President of the GDR and held the office until his death, while the SED general secretary Walter Ulbricht assumed most executive authority. Socialist leader Otto Grotewohl (1894–1964) became prime minister until his death.

The government of East Germany denounced West German failures in accomplishing denazification and renounced ties to the Nazi past, imprisoning many former Nazis and preventing them from holding government positions. The SED set a primary goal of ridding East Germany of all traces of Nazism. It is estimated that between 180,000 and 250,000 people were sentenced to imprisonment on political grounds.

=== Zones of occupation ===
In the Yalta and Potsdam conferences of 1945, the Allies established their joint military occupation and administration of Germany via the Allied Control Council (ACC), a four-power (US, UK, USSR, France) military government effective until the restoration of German sovereignty. In eastern Germany, the Soviet Occupation Zone (&quot;Sowjetische Besatzungszone&quot;, SBZ) comprised the five states (&quot;Länder&quot;) of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia. Disagreements over the policies to be followed in the occupied zones quickly led to a breakdown in cooperation between the four powers, and the Soviets administered their zone without regard to the policies implemented in the other zones. The Soviets withdrew from the ACC in 1948; subsequently, as the other three zones were increasingly unified and granted self-government, the Soviet administration instituted a separate socialist government in its zone.

Seven years after the Allies&#x27; 1945 Potsdam Agreement on common German policies, the USSR via the Stalin Note (10 March 1952) proposed German reunification and superpower disengagement from Central Europe, which the three Western Allies (US, UK, France) rejected. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, a Communist proponent of reunification, died in early March 1953. Similarly, Lavrenty Beria, the First Deputy Prime Minister of the USSR, pursued German reunification but was removed from power that same year before he could act on the matter. His successor, Nikita Khrushchev, rejected reunification as equivalent to returning East Germany for annexation to the West; hence reunification was off the table until the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989.

East Germany regarded East Berlin as its capital, and the Soviet Union and the rest of the Eastern Bloc diplomatically recognized East Berlin as the capital. However, the Western Allies disputed this recognition, and considered the entire city of Berlin to be occupied territory governed by the ACC. According to Margarete Feinstein, the West and most Third World countries largely unrecognized East Berlin&#x27;s status as the capital. In practice, the Cold War nullified the ACC&#x27;s authority, East Berlin&#x27;s status as occupied territory largely became a legal fiction, and the Soviet sector of Berlin fully integrated into the GDR.

The deepening Cold War conflict between the Western Powers and the Soviet Union over the unresolved status of West Berlin led to the Berlin Blockade (24 June 194812 May 1949). The Soviet army initiated the blockade by halting all Allied rail, road, and water traffic to and from West Berlin. The Allies countered the Soviets with the Berlin Airlift (1948–49) of food, fuel, and supplies to West Berlin.

=== Partition ===

On 21 April 1946 the Communist Party of Germany (; KPD) and the part of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (; SPD) in the Soviet zone merged to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (; SED), which then won the elections of October 1946. The SED government nationalised infrastructure and industrial plants.

In March 1948 the German Economic Commission (; DWK) under its chairman Heinrich Rau assumed administrative authority in the Soviet occupation zone, thus becoming the predecessor of the East German government.

On 7 October 1949 the SED established the German Democratic Republic (; GDR), based on a socialist political constitution establishing its control of the Anti-Fascist National Front of the German Democratic Republic (; NF), an omnibus alliance of every party and mass organisation in East Germany. The NF was established to stand for election to the People&#x27;s Chamber (), the East German parliament. The first and only president of the German Democratic Republic was Wilhelm Pieck. However, after 1950, political power in East Germany was held by the First Secretary of the SED, Walter Ulbricht.

On 16 June 1953, workers constructing the new boulevard in East Berlin, according to the GDR&#x27;s officially promulgated Sixteen Principles of Urban Design, rioted against a 10% production-quota increase. Initially a labour protest, the action soon included the general populace, and on 17 June similar protests occurred throughout the GDR, with more than a million people striking in some 700 cities and towns. Fearing anti-communist counter-revolution, on 18 June 1953 the government of the GDR enlisted the Soviet Occupation Forces to aid the police in ending the riot; some fifty people were killed and 10,000 were jailed (see Uprising of 1953 in East Germany).

The German war reparations owed to the Soviets impoverished the Soviet Zone of Occupation and severely weakened the East German economy. During 1945–46 the Soviets confiscated and transported to the USSR approximately 33% of the industrial plants, and by the early 1950s had extracted some US$10 billion in reparations in agricultural and industrial products. The poverty of East Germany, induced or deepened by reparations, provoked the (&quot;desertion from the republic&quot;) to West Germany, further weakening the GDR&#x27;s economy. Western economic opportunities induced a brain drain. In response, the GDR closed the inner German border, and on the night of 12 August 1961, East German soldiers began erecting the Berlin Wall.

In 1971, Ulbricht was removed from leadership after Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev supported his ouster; Erich Honecker replaced him. While the Ulbricht government had experimented with liberal reforms, the Honecker government reversed them. The new government introduced a new East German Constitution which defined the German Democratic Republic as a &quot;republic of workers and peasants&quot;.

Initially, East Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany, a claim supported by most of the Communist Bloc. It claimed that West Germany was an illegally constituted puppet state of NATO. However, from the 1960s onward, East Germany began recognizing itself as a separate country from West Germany and shared the legacy of the united German state of 1871–1945. This was formalized in 1974 when the reunification clause was removed from the revised East German constitution. West Germany, in contrast, maintained that it was the only legitimate government of Germany. From 1949 to the early 1970s, West Germany maintained that East Germany was an illegally constituted state. It argued that the GDR was a Soviet puppet-state and frequently referred to it as the &quot;Soviet occupation zone&quot;. West Germany&#x27;s allies shared this position until 1973. East Germany was recognized primarily by socialist countries and the Arab Bloc, along with some &quot;scattered sympathizers&quot;. According to the Hallstein Doctrine (1955), West Germany did not establish (formal) diplomatic ties with any countryexcept the Sovietsthat recognized East German sovereignty.

In the early 1970s, the (&#x27;Eastern Policy&#x27;) of &quot;Change Through Rapprochement&quot; of the pragmatic government of FRG Chancellor Willy Brandt, established normal diplomatic relations with the Eastern Bloc states. This policy saw the Treaty of Moscow (August 1970), the Treaty of Warsaw (December 1970), the Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971), the Transit Agreement (May 1972), and the Basic Treaty (December 1972), which relinquished any separate claims to an exclusive mandate over Germany as a whole and established normal relations between the two Germanies. Both countries were admitted into the United Nations on 18 September 1973. This also increased the number of countries recognizing East Germany to 55, including the US, UK and France, though these three still refused to recognize East Berlin as the capital, and insisted on a specific provision in the UN resolution accepting the two Germanies into the UN to that effect. Following the Ostpolitik, West Germany viewed East Germany as a &quot;de facto&quot; government within a single German nation and a &quot;de jure&quot; state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognize the GDR &quot;de jure&quot; as a sovereign state under international law; but it fully acknowledged that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state. By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; government, but also the sole &quot;de jure&quot; legitimate representative of a dormant &quot;Germany as whole&quot;. The two German governments each relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally, which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations &quot;de jure&quot; in participating in international bodies and agreements, such as the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act.

This assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1973:

Travel between the GDR and Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary became visa-free from 1972.

=== GDR identity ===

From the beginning, the newly formed GDR tried to establish its own separate identity. Because of the imperial and military legacy of Prussia, the SED repudiated continuity between Prussia and the GDR. The SED destroyed a number of symbolic relics of the former Prussian aristocracyJunker manor-houses were torn down, the Berliner Stadtschloß was razed and the Palace of the Republic was built in its place, and the equestrian statue of Frederick the Great was removed from East Berlin. Instead, the SED focused on the progressive heritage of German history, including Thomas Müntzer&#x27;s role in the German Peasants&#x27; War (1524–1525) and the roles of heroes of the class struggle during Prussia&#x27;s industrialization. The SED upheld other notable figures and reformers from Prussian historysuch as Karl Freiherr vom Stein (1757–1831), Karl August von Hardenberg (1750–1822), Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835), and Gerhard von Scharnhorst (1755–1813)as examples and role models.

==== Remembrance of the Third Reich ====

The communist regime of the GDR based its legitimacy on the struggle of anti-fascist militants. The Buchenwald Resistance, a form of resistance &quot;cult&quot;, was established at the memorial site of the Buchenwald concentration camp, with the creation of a museum in 1958, and the annual celebration of the Buchenwald oath taken on 19 April 1945 by the prisoners who pledged to fight for peace and freedom. In the 1990s, the &#x27;state anti-fascism&#x27; of the GDR gave way to the &#x27;state anti-communism&#x27; of the FRG. From then on, the dominant interpretation of GDR history, based on the concept of totalitarianism, led to the equivalence of communism and Nazism. Historian Anne-Kathleen Tillack-Graf describes how the national memorials of Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, and Ravensbrück were politically instrumentalised in the GDR, particularly during the celebrations of the liberation of the concentration camps. 

Although officially built in opposition to the &#x27;fascist world&#x27; in West Germany, 32% of GDR public administration employees in 1954 were former members of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). However, in 1961, the share of former NSDAP members among the senior Interior Ministry administration staff was less than 10% in the GDR, compared to 67% in the FRG. While a work of memory on the resurgence of Nazism was carried out in West Germany, this was not the case in the East. Indeed, as Axel Dossmann, professor of history at the University of Jena, notes,This phenomenon was completely hidden. For the state-SED (the East German communist party), it was impossible to admit the existence of neo-Nazis, since the foundation of the GDR was to be an anti-fascist state. The Stasi kept an eye on them, but they were considered to be outsiders or thick-skinned bullies. These young people grew up hearing double talk. At school, it was forbidden to talk about the Third Reich and, at home, their grandparents told them how, thanks to Hitler, we had the first motorways.On 17 October 1987, thirty or so skinheads violently threw themselves into a crowd of 2,000 people at a rock concert in the Zionskirche without the police intervening. In 1990, the writer Freya Klier received a death threat for writing an essay on antisemitism and xenophobia in the GDR. SPDA Vice President Wolfgang Thierse, for his part, complained in &quot;Die Welt&quot; about the rise of the extreme right in the everyday life of the inhabitants of the former GDR, in particular the terrorist group NSU, with the German journalist Odile Benyahia-Kouider explaining that &quot;it is no coincidence that the neo-Nazi party NPD has experienced a renaissance via the East&quot;.

The historian Sonia Combe observes that until the 1990s, the majority of West German historians described the Normandy landings in June 1944 as an &quot;invasion&quot;, exonerated the Wehrmacht of its responsibility for the genocide of the Jews, and fabricated the myth of a diplomatic corps that &quot;did not know&quot;. In contrast, Auschwitz was never a taboo in the GDR. The Nazis&#x27; crimes were the subject of extensive film, theatre, and literary productions. In 1991, 16% of the population in West Germany and 6% in East Germany had antisemitic prejudices. In 1994, 40% of West Germans and 22% of East Germans felt that too much emphasis was placed on the genocide of the Jews.

Historian Ulrich Pfeil, nevertheless, recalls the fact that anti-fascist commemoration in the GDR had &quot;a hagiographic and indoctrination character&quot;. As in the case of the memory of the protagonists of the German labour movement and the victims of the camps, it was &quot;staged, censored, ordered&quot; and, during the 40 years of the regime, was an instrument of legitimisation, repression, and maintenance of power.

=== &quot;Die Wende&quot; (German reunification) ===
In May 1989, following widespread public anger over the faking of local government election results, many GDR citizens applied for exit visas or left the country contrary to GDR laws. The impetus for this exodus of East Germans was the removal of the electrified fence along Hungary&#x27;s border with Austria on 2 May 1989. Although formally the Hungarian frontier was still closed, many East Germans took the opportunity to enter Hungary via Czechoslovakia, and then make the illegal crossing from Hungary to Austria and to West Germany beyond. By July, 25,000 East Germans had crossed into Hungary; most of them did not attempt the risky crossing into Austria but remained instead in Hungary or claimed asylum in West German embassies in Prague or Budapest.

The opening of a border gate between Austria and Hungary at the Pan-European Picnic on 19 August 1989 then triggered a chain reaction leading to the end of the GDR and the disintegration of the Eastern Bloc. It was the largest mass escape from East Germany since the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961. The idea of opening the border at a ceremony came from Otto von Habsburg, who proposed it to Miklós Németh, then Hungarian Prime Minister, who promoted the idea. The patrons of the picnic, Habsburg and Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay, who did not attend the event, saw the planned event as an opportunity to test Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reaction to an opening of the border on the Iron Curtain. In particular, it tested whether Moscow would give the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary the command to intervene. The Paneuropean Union advertised extensively for the planned picnic with posters and flyers distributed among GDR holidaymakers in Hungary. The Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union, then headed by Karl von Habsburg, distributed thousands of brochures inviting GDR citizens to a picnic near the border at Sopron (near Hungary&#x27;s border with Austria). The local Sopron organizers knew nothing of possible GDR refugees, but envisaged a local party with Austrian and Hungarian participation. But with the mass exodus at the picnic, the subsequent hesitant behavior of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-intervention of the Soviet Union broke the dams. Thus, the barrier of the Eastern Bloc was broken. Tens of thousands of East Germans, alerted by the media, made their way to Hungary, which was no longer ready to keep its borders completely closed or force its border troops to open fire on escapees. The GDR leadership in East Berlin did not dare to completely lock down their own country&#x27;s borders.

The next major turning point in the exodus came on 10 September 1989, when Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn announced that his country would no longer restrict movement from Hungary into Austria. Within two days, 22,000 East Germans crossed into Austria; tens of thousands more did so in the following weeks.

Many other GDR citizens demonstrated against the ruling party, especially in the city of Leipzig. The Leipzig demonstrations became a weekly occurrence, with a turnout of 10,000 people at the first demonstration on 2 October, and a peak of an estimated 300,000 by the end of the month. The protests were surpassed in East Berlin, where half a million demonstrators turned out against the regime on 4 November. Kurt Masur, conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, led local negotiations with the government and held town meetings in the concert hall. The demonstrations eventually led Erich Honecker to resign in October; he was replaced by a slightly more moderate communist, Egon Krenz.

The massive demonstration in East Berlin on 4 November coincided with Czechoslovakia formally opening its border to West Germany. With the West more accessible than ever before, 30,000 East Germans made the crossing via Czechoslovakia in the first two days alone. To try to stem the outward flow of the population, the SED proposed a law loosening travel restrictions. When the rejected it on 5 November, the Cabinet and Politburo of the GDR resigned. This left only one avenue open for Krenz and the SED: completely abolishing travel restrictions between East and West.

On 9 November 1989, a few sections of the Berlin Wall were opened, resulting in thousands of East Germans crossing freely into West Berlin and West Germany for the first time in nearly 30 years. Krenz resigned a month later, and the SED opened negotiations with the leaders of the incipient Democratic movement, Neues Forum, to schedule free elections and begin the process of democratization. As part of this process, the SED eliminated the clause in the East German constitution guaranteeing the Communists leadership of the state. The change was approved in the on 1 December 1989 by a vote of 420 to 0.

East Germany held its last election in March 1990. The winner was Alliance for Germany, a coalition headed by the East German branch of West Germany&#x27;s Christian Democratic Union, which advocated speedy reunification. Negotiations (2+4 Talks) were held involving the two German states and the former Allies, which led to agreement on the conditions for German unification. By a two-thirds vote in the on 23 August 1990, the German Democratic Republic declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany. The five original East German states that had been abolished in the 1952 redistricting were restored. On 3 October 1990, the five states officially joined the Federal Republic of Germany, while East and West Berlin united as a third city-state (in the same manner as Bremen and Hamburg). On 1 July, a currency union preceded the political union: the Ostmark was abolished, and the Western German Deutsche Mark became the common currency.

Although the &#x27;s declaration of accession to the Federal Republic had initiated the process of reunification, the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms, conditions, and qualifications, some of which involved amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990 – that is, through a binding agreement between the former Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic, now recognising each other as separate sovereign states in international law. The treaty was then voted into effect prior to the agreed date for unification by both the and the Bundestag by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities, effecting on the one hand the extinction of the GDR, and on the other the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic.

The wide economic and socio-political inequalities between the former German states required government subsidies for the full integration of the GDR into the FRG. Because of the resulting deindustrialization in former East Germany, the causes of the failure of this integration continue to be debated. Some western commentators claim that the depressed eastern economy is a natural aftereffect of a demonstrably inefficient command economy. But many East German critics contend that the shock-therapy style of privatization, the artificially high rate of exchange offered for the Ostmark, and the speed with which the entire process was implemented did not leave room for East German enterprises to adapt.

== Government and politics ==

The political history of East Germany had four periods: 1949–1961, which saw the building of socialism; 1961–1970, after the Berlin Wall closed off escape, was a period of stability and consolidation; 1971–1985 was termed the &quot;Honecker Era&quot;, and saw closer ties with West Germany; and 1985–1990 saw the decline and extinction of East Germany.

=== Organization ===
The ruling political party in East Germany was the (Socialist Unity Party of Germany; SED). It was created in 1946 through the Soviet-directed merger of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in the Soviet-controlled zone. However, the SED quickly transformed into a full-fledged communist party as the more independent-minded social democrats were pushed out.

The Potsdam Agreement committed the Soviets to support a democratic form of government in Germany, though the Soviets&#x27; understanding of democracy was radically different from that of the West. As in other Soviet Bloc countries, non-communist political parties were allowed. Nevertheless, every political party in the GDR was forced to join the National Front of Democratic Germany, a broad coalition of parties and mass political organisations, which included:
* (Christian Democratic Union of Germany; CDU), which merged with the West German CDU after reunification;
* (Democratic Farmers&#x27; Party of Germany; DBD), which party merged with the West German CDU after reunification;
* (Liberal Democratic Party of Germany; LDPD), which merged with the West German FDP after reunification;
* (National Democratic Party of Germany; NDPD), which merged with the West German FDP after reunification.

The member parties were almost completely subservient to the SED and had to accept its &quot;leading role&quot; as a condition of their existence. However, the parties did have representation in the Volkskammer and received some posts in the government.

The Volkskammer also included representatives from the mass organisations like the Free German Youth (; FDJ), or the Free German Trade Union Federation. There was also the Democratic Women&#x27;s Federation of Germany, with seats in the .

Important non-parliamentary mass organisations in East German society included the German Gymnastics and Sports Association (; DTSB), and the People&#x27;s Solidarity (), an organisation for the elderly. Another society of note was the Society for German–Soviet Friendship.

After the fall of socialism, the SED transformed into the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which continued for a decade after reunification, before merging with the West German WASG to form the Left Party (). The Left Party continues to be a political force in many parts of Germany, albeit drastically less powerful than the SED.

=== State symbols ===
The flag of the German Democratic Republic consisted of three horizontal stripes in the traditional German-democratic colors black-red-gold; at its center was a GDR national coat of arms, consisting of a wreath of corn surrounding a hammer and compass, which symbolised the alliance of workers, peasants, and intelligentsia. The first drafts of Fritz Behrendt&#x27;s coat of arms contained only a hammer and wreath of corn; the final version was mainly based on the work of Heinz Behling.

The state coat of arms and flag were set by law on 26 September 1955. Initially, the flag lacked the coat of arms; it was later added (1 October 1959). Until the end of the 1960s, the public display of this flag in the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin was regarded as a violation of the constitution and public order, and prevented by police measures. It was not until 1969 that the Federal Government decreed &quot;that the police should no longer intervene anywhere against the use of the flag and coat of arms of the GDR.&quot;

At the request of the DSU, the first freely elected People&#x27;s Chamber of the GDR decided on 31 May 1990 that the GDR state coat of arms should be removed within a week in and on public buildings. Nevertheless, until the official end of the republic, it continued to be used in other ways, such as on documents.

The national anthem of the GDR, &quot;Resurrected from Ruins&quot;, had its text was written by Johannes R. Becher and its melody composed by Hanns Eisler. From the beginning of the 1970s to the end of 1989, however, the text of the anthem was no longer sung due to the passage &quot;Deutschland einig Vaterland&quot; (&quot;Germany a united Fatherland&quot;).
==== Presidential standard ====
The first standard of the president had the shape of a rectangular flag in the colors black-red-gold with the inscription &quot;President&quot; in yellow in the red stripe, as well as &quot;D.D.R.&quot; (contrary to the official abbreviation with dots) in the stripe below in black letters. The flag was surrounded by a stripe of yellow color. An original of the standard is in the German Historical Museum in Berlin.

==== War and service flags and symbols ====
The flags of the military units of the GDR bore the national coat of arms with a wreath of two olive branches on a red background in the black-red-gold flag.

The flags of the People&#x27;s Navy for combat ships and boats bore the coat of arms with olive branch wreath on red, for auxiliary ships and boats on blue flag cloth with a narrow and centrally arranged black-red-gold band. As Gösch, the state flag was used in a reduced form.

The ships and boats of the Border Brigade Coast on the Baltic Sea and the boats of the border troops of the GDR on the Elbe and Oder carried a green bar on the Liekjust like the service flag of the border troops.


==== Political and social emblems ====
After being a member of the Thälmann Pioneers, which was for schoolchildren ages 6 to 14, East German youths would usually join the Free German Youth (&quot;Freie Deutsche Jugend&quot;; FDJ).
=== Young Pioneer programs ===

==== Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation ====


The Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation was a youth organisation of schoolchildren aged 6 to 14 in East Germany. In the 1960s and 1970s, nearly all schoolchildren were organised into &quot;Young Pioneer&quot; or &quot;Thälmann Pioneer&quot; groups, with the organisations having &quot;nearly two million children&quot; collectively by 1975. The group was a subdivision of the &quot;Freie Deutsche Jugend&quot; (FDJ), East Germany&#x27;s youth movement.

The pioneer group was loosely based on Scouting, but organised to teach socialist ideology to schoolchildren and prepare them for the FDJ. The program was designed to follow the Soviet pioneer program Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization. Both pioneer groups would often have massive parades, honoring and celebrating the socialist success of their nations.

Membership was formally voluntary, but often expected by the state or by parents. In practice, admission of all students in a class came from the school. As the membership quota of up to 98 percent of the students (in the later years of the GDR) shows, the six- or ten-year-olds (or their parents) had to be independently active to &quot;not&quot; become members. Rarely, students were not admitted because of poor academic performance or bad behavior &quot;as a punishment&quot;, or excluded from further membership.

The pioneers&#x27; uniform consisted of white shirts and blouses, along with blue trousers or skirts. A distinctive feature was the triangular neckerchief. In contrast to the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries, a blue neckerchief was common in the GDR. On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the organization in 1973, the red neckerchief was introduced for the Thälmann Pioneers.

==== Free German Youth ====

After being a member of the Thälmann Pioneers, East German youths would usually join the &quot;Freie Deutsche Jugend&quot; (Free German Youth; FDJ), a youth organization for both boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 25 and which comprised about 75% of the GDR&#x27;s young population. In 1981–1982, this meant 2.3 million members. Its main objective was to win over the hearts and minds of young East Germans to socialism and the ideals of the SED.

The FDJ was founded in 1946 with an emphasis on &#x27;happy youth life&#x27;, which involved organised activities like sports, dances, concerts, and hikes. During the following decades, the FDJ increasingly developed into an instrument of communist rule, and gained a more severe anti-religious agenda. After German reunification in October 1990, the FDJ quickly lost nearly all of its remaining memberships.

Upon request, young people were admitted to the FDJ from the age of 14. Membership was voluntary according to the statutes, but there was high pressure to join from line-loyal teachers and societal expectations. Non-members had to fear considerable disadvantages in school admission, choice of study, career, and military service. By the end of 1949, almost a third of young people (around one million) had joined; yet in Berlin, where other youth organizations were also admitted due to the four-power status, participation was limited to just under 5%. In 1985, about 80% of all GDR youths between the ages of 14 and 25 were members. Most young people tacitly ended their FDJ membership after completing their apprenticeship or studies when they entered the workforce. The degree of organisation was much higher in urban areas than in rural areas.

From 1948, the official organizational clothing of the FDJ were long-sleeved blue shirts for boys and blouses for girls. The left sleeve was sewn with the FDJ symbol of the rising sun.

===Administrative districts===
Until 1952, East Germany comprised the capital, East Berlin (though legally it was not fully part of the GDR&#x27;s territory), and the five German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (in 1947 renamed Mecklenburg), Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt (named Province of Saxony until 1946), Thuringia, and Saxony. The states&#x27; post-war territorial demarcations approximated the pre-war German demarcations of the Middle German &quot;Länder&quot; (states) and &quot;Provinzen&quot; (provinces of Prussia). The western parts of two provinces, Pomerania and Lower Silesia, the remainder of which were annexed by Poland, remained in the GDR and were attached to Mecklenburg and Saxony, respectively.

The East German Administrative Reform of 1952 established 14 (districts) and &quot;de facto&quot; disestablished the five &quot;Länder&quot;. The new , named after their district centres, were as follows: (i) Rostock, (ii) Neubrandenburg, and (iii) Schwerin created from the &quot;Land&quot; (state) of Mecklenburg; (iv) Potsdam, (v) Frankfurt (Oder), and (vii) Cottbus from Brandenburg; (vi) Magdeburg and (viii) Halle from Saxony-Anhalt; (ix) Leipzig, (xi) Dresden, and (xii) Karl-Marx-Stadt (Chemnitz until 1953 and again from 1990) from Saxony; and (x) Erfurt, (xiii) Gera, and (xiv) Suhl from Thuringia.

East Berlin was made the country&#x27;s 15th &quot;Bezirk&quot; in 1961 but retained special legal status until 1968, when the residents approved the new (draft) constitution. Despite the city as a whole being legally under the control of the Allied Control Council, and diplomatic objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the &quot;Bezirk&quot; of Berlin as part of its territory.
=== Foreign relations ===
==== Support of Third World socialist countries ====
After receiving wider international diplomatic recognition in 1972–73, the GDR began active cooperation with Third World socialist governments and national liberation movements. While the USSR was in control of the overall strategy and Cuban armed forces were involved in the actual combat (mostly in the People&#x27;s Republic of Angola and socialist Ethiopia), the GDR provided experts for military hardware maintenance and personnel training, and oversaw creation of secret security agencies based on its own Stasi model.

Already in the 1960s, contacts were established with the MPLA in Angola, the FRELIMO in Mozambique, and the PAIGC in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. In the 1970s, official cooperation was established with other socialist states, such as the People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo, People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen, Somali Democratic Republic, Libya, and the People&#x27;s Republic of Benin.

The first military agreement was signed in 1973 with the People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo. In 1979 friendship treaties were signed with Angola, Mozambique, and Ethiopia.

It was estimated that altogether 2,000–4,000 DDR military and security experts were dispatched to Africa. In addition, representatives from African and Arab countries and liberation movements underwent military training in the GDR.

==== East Germany and the Middle East conflict ====
East Germany pursued an anti-Zionist policy; Jeffrey Herf argues that East Germany was waging an undeclared war on Israel. According to Herf, &quot;the Middle East was one of the crucial battlefields of the global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West; it was also a region in which East Germany played a salient role in the Soviet bloc&#x27;s antagonism toward Israel.&quot; While East Germany saw itself as an &quot;anti-fascist state&quot;, it regarded Israel as a &quot;fascist state&quot;, and East Germany strongly supported the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in its armed struggle against Israel. In 1974, the GDR government recognized the PLO as the &quot;sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people&quot;. The PLO declared the Palestinian state on 15 November 1988 during the First Intifada, and the GDR recognized the state prior to reunification. After becoming a member of the UN, East Germany &quot;made excellent use of the UN to wage political warfare against Israel [and was] an enthusiastic, high-profile, and vigorous member&quot; of the anti-Israeli majority of the General Assembly.

Ba&#x27;athist Iraq, due to its wealth of unexploited natural resources, was sought out as an ally of East Germany, with Iraq being the first Arab country to recognise East Germany on 10 May 1969, paving the way for other Arab League states to later do the same. East Germany attempted to play a decisive role in mediating the conflict between the Iraqi Communist Party and the Ba&#x27;ath Party and supported the creation of the National Progressive Front. The East German government also attempted to foster close relations with the Ba&#x27;athist regime of Hafez al-Assad during the early years of Assad&#x27;s regime and, as it did in Iraq, used its influence to minimise tensions between the Syrian Communist Party and the Ba&#x27;athist regime.

==== Western Europe ====
During the Cold War, especially during its early years, the East German government attempted to build closer diplomatic relations and trade links between Iceland and East Germany. By the 1950s, East Germany had become Iceland&#x27;s fifth largest trading partner. East German influence in Iceland significantly declined in the 1970s and 1980s following a schism between the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Icelandic Socialist Party over the Prague Spring, along with free market economic reforms implemented by Iceland during the 1960s.

==== Soviet military occupation ====
=== Military ===
The government of East Germany controlled a large number of military and paramilitary organisations through various ministries. Chief among these was the Ministry of National Defence. Because of East Germany&#x27;s proximity to the West during the Cold War (1945–92), its military forces were among the most advanced of the Warsaw Pact. Defining what was a military force and what was not is a matter of some dispute.

==== National People&#x27;s Army ====

The (NVA) was the largest military organisation in East Germany. It was formed in 1956 from the (Barracked People&#x27;s Police), the military units of the regular police (Volkspolizei), when East Germany joined the Warsaw Pact. From its creation, it was controlled by the Ministry of National Defence. It was an all-volunteer force until an eighteen-month conscription period was introduced in 1962. NATO officers regarded it as the best military in the Warsaw Pact.
The NVA consisted of the following branches:
* Land Forces of the National People&#x27;s Army
* People&#x27;s Navy
* Air Forces of the National People&#x27;s Army

==== Border troops ====

The border troops of the Eastern sector were originally organised as a police force, the , similar to the in West Germany. It was controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. Following the remilitarisation of East Germany in 1956, the was transformed into a military force in 1961, modeled after the Soviet Border Troops, and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense, as part of the National People&#x27;s Army. In 1973, it was separated from the NVA, but it remained under the same ministry. At its peak, it numbered approximately 47,000 men.

==== Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft ====

After the NVA was separated from the in 1956, the Ministry of the Interior maintained its own public order barracked reserve, known as the (VPB). These units were equipped as motorised infantry, like the , and in total numbered between 12,000 and 15,000 men.

==== Stasi ====

The Ministry of State Security (Stasi) included the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment, which was mainly involved with facilities security and plain clothes events security. They were the only public-facing wing of the Stasi. The Stasi numbered around 90,000 men, the Guards Regiment around 11,000–12,000 men.

==== Combat groups of the working class ====
The (Combat Groups of the Working Class; KdA) numbered around 400,000 men for much of their existence, and were organised around factories. The KdA was the political-military instrument of the SED; it was essentially a &quot;party army&quot;. All KdA directives and decisions were made by the ZK&#x27;s . They received their training from the Volkspolizei and the Ministry of the Interior. Membership was voluntary, but SED members were required to join as part of their membership obligation.

==== Conscientious objection ====
Every man was required to serve eighteen months of compulsory military service. For the medically unqualified and conscientious objectors, there were the (construction units) or the (People&#x27;s Sanitation Service), both established in 1964, two years after the introduction of conscription, in response to political pressure by the national Lutheran Protestant Church upon the GDR&#x27;s government. In the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former construction soldiers and sanitation service soldiers were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere.

=== Totalitarianism and repression ===
There is general consensus among academics that the GDR fulfilled most of the criteria to be considered a totalitarian state. There is, however, ongoing debate as to whether the more positive aspects of the regime can sufficiently dilute the harsher aspects so as to make the totalitarian tag seem excessive. According to the historian Mary Fulbrook:

The state security service (SSD), commonly known as the Stasi, was fundamental to the socialist leadership&#x27;s attempts to reach their historical goal. It was an open secret in the GDR that the Stasi read people&#x27;s mail and tapped phone calls. They also employed a vast network of unofficial informers who would spy on people more directly and report to their Stasi handlers. These collaborators were hired in all walks of life and had access to nearly every organisation in the country. At the end of the GDR in 1990 there were approximately 109,000 still-active informants at every grade. Repressive measures carried out by the Stasi can be roughly divided into two main chronological groupings: before 1971 and after 1971, when Honecker came to power. According to the historian Nessim Ghouas, &quot;There was a change in how the Stasi operated under Honecker in 1971. The more brutal aspects of repression seen in the Stalinist era (torture, executions, and physical repression descending from the GDR&#x27;s earlier days) was changed with a more selective use of power.&quot;

The more direct forms of repression such as arrest and torture could mean significant international condemnation for the GDR. However, the Stasi still needed to paralyse and disrupt what it considered to be &#x27;hostile-negative&#x27; forces (internal domestic enemies) if the socialist goal was to be properly realised. A person could be targeted by the Stasi for expressing politically, culturally, or religiously incorrect views; for performing hostile acts; or for being a member of a group which was considered sufficiently counter-productive to the socialist state to warrant intervention. As such, writers, artists, youth sub-cultures, and members of the church were often targeted. If after preliminary research the Stasi found an individual warranted action against them then they would open an &#x27;operational case&#x27; in regard to them. There were two desirable outcomes for each case: that the person was either arrested, tried, and imprisoned for an ostensibly justified reason, or, if this could not be achieved, that they were debilitated through the application of &quot;Zersetzung&quot; (&quot;decomposition&quot;) methods. In the Honecker era, Zersetzung became the primary method of Stasi repression, due in large part to an ambition to avoid political fallout from wrongful arrest. Historian Mike Dennis says, &quot;Between 1985–1988, the Stasi conducted about 4,500 to 5,000 OVs (operational cases) per year.&quot;

Zersetzung methods varied and were tailored depending on the targeted individual. They are known to have included sending offensive mail to a person&#x27;s house, the spreading of malicious rumours, banning them from traveling, sabotaging their career, and breaking into their house and moving objects around. These acts frequently led to unemployment, social isolation, and poor mental health. Many people had various forms of mental or nervous breakdown. Similarly to physical imprisonment, Zersetzung methods had the effect of paralysing a person&#x27;s ability to operate but with the advantage of the source being unknown or at least unprovable. There is ongoing debate as to whether weaponised directed energy devices, such as X-ray transmitters, were used in combination with the psychological warfare methods of Zersetzung. About 135,000 children were educated in special residential homes; the worst of them was Torgau penal institution (until 1975). The International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims considers that there are between 300,000 and 500,000 victims of direct physical torture, Zersetzung, and gross human rights violations due to the Stasi. Victims of historical Zersetzung can now draw a special pension from the German state.

== Economy ==
The East German economy began poorly because of the devastation caused by the Second World War, the loss of so many young soldiers, the disruption of business and transportation, the Allied bombing campaigns that decimated cities, and reparations owed to the USSR. The Red Army dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and Lower Silesia, with its coal mines, and Szczecin, an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin and in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

The socialist centrally planned economy of the German Democratic Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the COMECON trade bloc. In 1985, collective (state) enterprises earned 97% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($22,600 in 2015 dollars) (this is based on an unreal official exchange rate). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was 5 percent. This made the East German economy the richest in all of the Soviet Bloc until reunification in 1990.

Notable East German exports were photographic cameras, under the Praktica brand; automobiles under the Trabant, Wartburg, and IFA brands; hunting rifles, sextants, typewriters, and wristwatches.

Until the 1960s, East Germans endured shortages of basic foodstuffs such as sugar and coffee. East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or with any access to a hard currency) and the necessary foreign currency account could afford Western products and export-quality East German products via Intershop. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish Jauerfood, and Genex companies.

The government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as &quot;the second pay packet&quot;. At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard currency loans from West Germany. East Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft currency as worthless relative to the Deutsche Mark (DM). Economic issues would also persist in East Germany after the reunification of the West and the East. According to Manfred Görtemaker, &quot;In 1991 alone, 153 billion DM had to be transferred to eastern Germany to secure incomes, support businesses and improve infrastructure. [...] From 1991 to 1999, this resulted in a total of 1.634 trillion [DM]. [...] The sums were so large that public debt in Germany more than doubled. [...]&quot;

=== Consumption and jobs ===
Loyalty to the SED was a primary criterion for getting a good job – professionalism was secondary to political criteria in personnel recruitment and development.

Beginning in 1963 with a series of secret international agreements, East Germany recruited workers from Poland, Hungary, Cuba, Albania, Mozambique, Angola, and North Vietnam. They numbered more than 100,000 by 1989. Many, such as future politician Zeca Schall (who emigrated from Angola in 1988 as a contract worker), stayed in Germany after the Wende.

=== Transportation ===

* Interflug

=== Telecommunications ===

By the mid-1980s, East Germany possessed a well-developed communications system. There were approximately 3.6 million telephones in usage (21.8 for every 100 inhabitants), and 16,476 Telex stations. The Deutsche Post der DDR (East German Post Office) operated both these networks. East Germany was assigned telephone country code +37; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone exchanges were incorporated into country code +49.

An unusual feature of the telephone network was that, in most cases, direct distance dialing for long-distance calls was not possible. Although area codes were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for local calls and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.

In 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based radio station at Fürstenwalde for the purpose of relaying and receiving communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet government, Intersputnik.

== Demographics ==


The East German population declined by three million people throughout its forty-one year history, from 19 million in 1948 to 16 million in 1990; of the 1948 population, some four million were deported from the lands east of the Oder–Neisse line, which made the home of millions of Germans part of Poland and the Soviet Union. This was in contrast to Poland&#x27;s population, which increased during that time from 24 million in 1950 (a little more than East Germany) to 38 million (more than twice of East Germany&#x27;s population). This was primarily a result of emigrationabout one quarter of East Germans left the country before the Berlin Wall was completed in 1961, and after that time, East Germany had very low birth rates, except for a recovery in the 1980s when the birth rate in East Germany was considerably higher than in West Germany.

=== Vital statistics ===


=== Religion ===


Religion became contested ground in the GDR, with the governing communists promoting state atheism, although some people remained loyal to Christian communities. In 1957, the state authorities established a State Secretariat for Church Affairs to handle the government&#x27;s contact with churches and with religious groups; the SED remained officially atheist.

In 1950, 85% of the GDR citizens were Protestants, while 10% were Catholics. In 1961, the renowned philosophical theologian Paul Tillich claimed that the Protestant population in East Germany had the most admirable Church in Protestantism, because the communists there had not been able to win a spiritual victory over them. By 1989, membership in the Christian churches had dropped significantly. Protestants constituted 25% of the population, Catholics 5%. The share of people who considered themselves non-religious rose from 5% in 1950 to 70% in 1989.

==== State atheism ====
When it first came to power, the Communist Party asserted the compatibility of Christianity and Marxism–Leninism and sought Christian participation in the building of socialism. At first, the promotion of Marxist–Leninist atheism received little official attention. In the mid-1950s, as the Cold War heated up, atheism became a topic of major interest for the state, in both domestic and foreign contexts. University chairs and departments devoted to the study of scientific atheism were founded and much literature (scholarly and popular) on the subject was produced. This activity subsided in the late 1960s amid perceptions that it had started to become counterproductive. Official and scholarly attention to atheism renewed beginning in 1973, though this time with more emphasis on scholarship and on the training of cadres than on propaganda. Throughout, the attention paid to atheism in East Germany was never intended to jeopardise the cooperation that was desired from those East Germans who were religious.

==== Protestantism ====


East Germany, historically, was majority Protestant (primarily Lutheran) from the early stages of the Protestant Reformation onwards. In 1948, freed from the influence of the Nazi-oriented German Christians, Lutheran, Reformed, and United churches from most parts of Germany united as the Protestant Church in Germany (&quot;Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland&quot;; EKD) at the Conference of Eisenach (&quot;Kirchenversammlung von Eisenach&quot;).

In 1969, the regional Protestant churches in East Germany and East Berlin broke away from the EKD and formed the &quot;&quot; (; BEK); the Moravian &quot;Herrnhuter Brüdergemeinde&quot; also joined in 1970. In June 1991, following the German reunification, the BEK churches remerged with the EKD.

Between 1956 and 1971, the leadership of the East German Lutheran churches gradually changed its relations with the state from hostility to cooperation. From the founding of the GDR in 1949, the Socialist Unity Party sought to weaken the influence of the Church on the rising generation. The Church adopted an attitude of confrontation and distance toward the state. Around 1956 this began to develop into a more neutral stance accommodating conditional loyalty. The government was no longer regarded as illegitimate; instead, church leaders started to view the authorities as installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. Still, churches reserved their right to reject state demands on matters that they felt were not in accordance with the will of God. There were both structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which made it clear that the East German state was not temporary. The loss of church members also made it clear to church leaders that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the state. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a traditional liberal Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward socialist ideas.

Manfred Stolpe became a lawyer for the Brandenburg Protestant Church in 1959 before taking up a position at church headquarters in Berlin. In 1969 he helped found the (BEK), where he negotiated with the government while at the same time working within the institutions of this Protestant body. He won the regional elections for the Brandenburg state assembly at the head of the SPD list in 1990. Stolpe remained in the Brandenburg government until he joined the federal government in 2002.

Apart from the Protestant state churches (, united in the EKD/BEK) and the Catholic Church, there were a number of smaller Protestant bodies, including Protestant Free Churches () united in the and the , as well as the Free Lutheran Church, the Old Lutheran Church, and Federation of the Reformed Churches in the German Democratic Republic. The Moravian Church also had its presence as the . There were also other Protestants such as Methodists, Adventists, Mennonites, and Quakers.

==== Catholicism ====


The smaller Catholic Church in eastern Germany had a fully functioning episcopal hierarchy in full accord with the Vatican. During the early postwar years, tensions were high. The Catholic Church as a whole (and particularly the bishops) resisted both the East German state and Marxist–Leninist ideology. The state allowed the bishops to lodge protests, which they did on issues such as abortion.

After 1945, the Church did fairly well in integrating Catholic exiles from lands to the east (which mostly became part of Poland) and in adjusting its institutional structures to meet the needs of a church within an officially atheist society. This meant an increasingly hierarchical church structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took into account the special situation of Caritas, a Catholic charity organisation. By 1950, therefore, there existed a Catholic subsociety that was well adjusted to prevailing specific conditions and capable of maintaining Catholic identity.

With a generational change in the episcopacy taking place in the early 1980s, the state hoped for better relations with the new bishops, but the new bishops instead began holding unauthorised mass meetings, promoting international ties in discussions with theologians abroad, and hosting ecumenical conferences. The new bishops became less politically oriented and more involved in pastoral care and attention to spiritual concerns. The government responded by limiting international contacts for bishops.

=== Education ===
==== Childcare system ====

About 600,000 children and youth were involved in East German residential childcare system.
== Culture ==
East Germany&#x27;s culture was strongly influenced by communist thought and was marked by an attempt to define itself in opposition to the West, particularly West Germany and the United States. Critics of the East German state have claimed that the state&#x27;s commitment to communism was a hollow and cynical tool, Machiavellian in nature, but this assertion has been challenged by studies that have found that the East German leadership was genuinely committed to the advance of scientific knowledge, economic development, and social progress. However, Pence and Betts argue, the majority of East Germans over time increasingly regarded the state&#x27;s ideals to be hollow, though there were also a substantial number of East Germans who regarded their culture as having a healthier, more authentic mentality than that of West Germany.

Harsh censorship limited GDR culture and politics. Compared to the music of the FRG, the freedom of art was less restricted by private-sector guidelines, but by guidelines from the state and the SED. Nevertheless, many musicians strove to explore the existing boundaries. Despite the state&#x27;s support for music education, there were politically motivated conflicts with the state, especially among rock, blues, and folk musicians and songwriters, as well as composers of so-called &quot;serious music&quot;.

=== Music ===

A special feature of GDR culture is the broad spectrum of German rock bands. The Puhdys and Karat were some of the most popular mainstream bands in East Germany. Like most mainstream acts, they were members of the SED, and appeared in state-run popular youth magazines such as &quot;Neues Leben&quot; and &quot;Magazin&quot;. Other popular rock bands were , City, Silly, and Pankow. Most of these artists recorded on the state-owned AMIGA label.

The schlager genre, which was very popular in the West, also gained a foothold early on in East Germany, and numerous musicians, such as , , and gained national fame. From 1962 to 1976, an international schlager festival was held in Rostock, garnering participants from between 18 and 22 countries each year. The city of Dresden held a similar international festival for schlager musicians from 1971 until shortly before reunification. There was a national schlager contest hosted yearly in Magdeburg from 1966 to 1971 as well.

Bands and singers from other socialist countries were popular, such as Czerwone Gitary from Poland known as the . Czech Karel Gott, the Golden Voice from Prague, was beloved in both German states. Hungarian band Omega performed in both German states, and Yugoslavian band Korni Grupa toured East Germany in the 1970s.

West German television and radio could be received in many parts of the East. The Western influence led to the formation of more &quot;underground&quot; groups with a decisively western-oriented sound. A few of these bands – the so-called &quot;Die anderen Bands&quot; (&quot;the other bands&quot;) – were , , and Feeling B. Additionally, hip hop culture reached the ears of the East German youth. With videos such as &quot;Beat Street&quot; and &quot;Wild Style&quot;, young East Germans were able to develop a hip hop culture of their own. East Germans accepted hip hop as more than just a music form. The entire street culture surrounding rap entered the region and became an outlet for oppressed youth.

The government of the GDR was invested in both promoting the tradition of German classical music, and in supporting composers to write new works in that tradition. Notable East German composers include Hanns Eisler, Paul Dessau, Ernst Hermann Meyer, Rudolf Wagner-Régeny, and Kurt Schwaen.

The birthplace of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750), Eisenach, was rendered as a museum about him, featuring more than three hundred instruments, which, in 1980, received some 70,000 visitors. In Leipzig, the Bach archive contains his compositions and correspondence and recordings of his music.

Governmental support of classical music maintained some 168 publicly funded concert, opera, chamber, and radio orchestras, such as Gewandhausorchester and Thomanerchor in Leipzig; Sächsische Staatskapelle in Dresden; and Berliner Sinfonie Orchester and Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin. Kurt Masur was their prominent conductor.

==== Censorship in the music sector ====
All productions were subject to censorship. Texts had to be submitted and shows approved in advance; performances were watched. No one was exempt from this, not even famous artists with connections to the highest circles of the SED government. Under this pressure, strategies were developed to bring critical texts to the audience despite censorship. For example, Heinz Quermann always deliberately built an extreme gag into his entertainment programme so that the censors would have something to cut and the other gags would be less critically scrutinised. Tamara Danz of the band Silly founded the term &quot;green elephant&quot; (&quot;grüner Elefant&quot;) for such passages.

At the beginning of the 1960s, the music of the Beatles influenced GDR youth. Initially, this music was still tolerated and supported by the GDR leadership, especially with the help of the FDJ. The high point of this era was 1965, when GDR bands not only got radio and television appearances, but were even allowed to make recordings. However, the SED realised that it could not control and steer this movement, which was basically rebellious and oriented towards the West. In response, most beat bands were therefore simply banned, the others were strictly controlled. For example, Thomas Natschinski&#x27;s band had to change its English name &quot;Team 4&quot; to the German name &quot;Thomas Natschinski and his group&quot;. Other bands were not so conformist. Renft in particular was repeatedly banned from performing and later also the blues rock band Freygang, whose members went into hiding and then played under pseudonyms. This crackdown led to the Leipzig Beat Revolt in October that year.

Even convinced socialists were banned from performing if their ideas of socialism differed from those of the SED. In 1976, singer-songwriter Wolf Biermann was allowed to tour in the West; this was immediately taken as an opportunity to denaturalise him and refuse him permission to return. Numerous artists protested against this and were forced to leave the country – some after serving prison sentences – including members of Renft, as well as Manfred Krug and Nina Hagen. Other artists left voluntarily. Veronika Fischer, for example, did not return from a performance in West Berlin in 1981, whereupon her songs were no longer allowed to be played by GDR radio stations.

West German productions were also subject to censorship in East Germany. For example, the song by Udo Jürgens &quot;&quot; (&quot;Once Upon a Time There Was a Balloon&quot;) was put on the Index because of the line, &quot;They know no borders, the balloons of the world&quot;. It was not until 1987 that Jürgens was again allowed to perform in the GDR. Udo Lindenberg had similar problems. Despite all his efforts (such as his song &quot;&quot; (&quot;Special Train to Pankow&quot;)), he was only allowed to perform once before the fall of the Berlin Wall, at the Palast der Republik on the occasion of the event &quot;&quot; (&quot;Rock for Peace&quot;) on 25 October 1983.

In the 1980s, censorship seemed to loosen up. Lyrics about the longing for freedom (including &quot;Albatros&quot; by Karat) became possible. But it was only in the course of the peaceful revolution that songs by Veronika Fischer were heard on the radio again in October 1989.

=== Theatre ===
East German theatre was originally dominated by Bertolt Brecht, who brought back many artists out of exile and reopened the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm with his Berliner Ensemble. Alternatively, other influences tried to establish a &quot;working-class theatre&quot;, played for the working class by the working class.

After Brecht&#x27;s death, conflicts began to arise between his family (around Helene Weigel) and other artists about Brecht&#x27;s legacy, including Slatan Dudow, Erwin Geschonneck, Erwin Strittmatter, Peter Hacks, Benno Besson, Peter Palitzsch, and Ekkehard Schall.

In the 1950s, the Swiss director Benno Besson with the Deutsches Theater successfully toured Europe and Asia including Japan with &quot;The Dragon&quot; by Evgeny Schwartz. In the 1960s, he became the Intendant of the Volksbühne often working with Heiner Müller.

In the 1970s, a parallel theatre scene sprung up, creating theatre &quot;outside of Berlin&quot; in which artists played at provincial theatres. For example, Peter Sodann founded the Neues Theater in Halle/Saale and Frank Castorf at the theater Anklam.

Theatre and cabaret had high status in the GDR, which allowed it to be very proactive. This often brought it into confrontation with the state. Benno Besson once said, &quot;In contrast to artists in the west, they took us seriously, we had a bearing.&quot;

The Friedrichstadt-Palast in Berlin was the last major building erected by the GDR, making it an exceptional architectural testimony to how Germany overcame its former division. Today, it is a major center for Berlin&#x27;s revue tradition. Other important theatres include the Berliner Ensemble, the Deutsches Theater, the Maxim Gorki Theater, and the Volksbühne.

=== Television and radio ===

Television and radio in East Germany were state-run industries; the &quot;Rundfunk der DDR&quot; was the official radio broadcasting organisation from 1952 until unification. The organization was based in the &quot;Funkhaus Nalepastraße&quot; in East Berlin. &quot;Deutscher Fernsehfunk&quot; (DFF), from 1972 to 1990 known as &quot;Fernsehen der DDR&quot; or DDR-FS, was the state television broadcaster from 1952. Reception of Western broadcasts was widespread.

=== Cinema ===
The prolific cinema of East Germany was headed by the &quot;Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft&quot; (DEFA), which was subdivided in different local groups whose local teams shot and produced films. The East German industry became known worldwide for its productions, especially children&#x27;s movies (&quot;Das kalte Herz&quot;, film versions of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales, and modern productions such as &quot;Das Schulgespenst&quot;).

Frank Beyer&#x27;s &quot;Jakob der Lügner&quot; (&quot;Jacob the Liar&quot;), about the Holocaust, and &quot;Fünf Patronenhülsen&quot; (&quot;Five Cartridges&quot;), about resistance against fascism, became internationally famous.

Films about daily life, such as &quot;Die Legende von Paul und Paula&quot;, by Heiner Carow, and &quot;Solo Sunny&quot;, directed by Konrad Wolf and Wolfgang Kohlhaase, were very popular.

The film industry was remarkable for its production of &quot;Ostern&quot;, or Western-like movies. In these films, Native Americans often took the role of displaced people who fight for their rights, in contrast to the North American westerns of the time, where they were often either not mentioned at all or portrayed as villains. Yugoslavs were often cast as Native Americans because of the small number of Native Americans in Europe. Gojko Mitić was well known in these roles, often playing the righteous, kindhearted, and charming chief (as in &quot;Die Söhne der großen Bärin&quot; directed by Josef Mach). He became an honorary Sioux chief when he visited the United States in the 1990s, and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his movies. American actor and singer Dean Reed, an expatriate who lived in East Germany, also starred in several films. These films were part of the phenomenon of Europe producing alternative films about the colonization of the Americas.

Cinemas in the GDR also showed foreign films. Czechoslovak and Polish productions were more common, but certain Western movies were shown, though the numbers of these were limited because it cost foreign exchange to buy the licenses. Further, films representing or glorifying what the state viewed as capitalist ideology were not bought. Comedies enjoyed great popularity, such as the Danish &quot;Olsen Gang&quot; or movies with the French comedian Louis de Funès.

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, several films depicting life in the GDR have been critically acclaimed. Some of the most notable were &quot;Good Bye Lenin!&quot; by Wolfgang Becker, &quot;Das Leben der Anderen&quot; (&quot;The Lives of Others&quot;) by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (which won the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film) in 2006, and &quot;Alles auf Zucker!&quot; (&quot;Go for Zucker&quot;) by Dani Levi. Each film is heavily infused with cultural nuances of life in the GDR.

=== Sport ===
East Germany was very successful in the sports of cycling, weightlifting, swimming, gymnastics, track and field, boxing, ice skating, and winter sports. The success is largely attributed to doping under the direction of Manfred Höppner, a sports doctor, described as the architect of East Germany&#x27;s state-sponsored drug program.

Anabolic steroids were the most detected doping substances in IOC-accredited laboratories for many years. The development and implementation of a state-supported sports doping program helped East Germany, with its small population, to become a world leader in sport during the 1970s and 1980s, winning a large number of Olympic and world gold medals and records. Another factor for success was the furtherance system for young people in the GDR. Sports teachers at school were encouraged to look for certain talents in children of ages 6 to 10. For older pupils it was possible to attend grammar schools with a focus on sports (for example sailing, football and swimming).
Sports clubs were highly subsidized, especially sports in which international fame was possible. For example, the major leagues for ice hockey and basketball just included two teams each. Football was the most popular sport. Club football teams such as Dynamo Dresden, 1. FC Magdeburg, FC Carl Zeiss Jena, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, and BFC Dynamo had successes in European competition. Many East German players such as Matthias Sammer and Ulf Kirsten became integral parts of the reunified national football team.

The East and the West also competed via sport. GDR athletes dominated several Olympic sports; the SV Dynamo club of the security agencies won more than 200 Olympic medals. Of special interest was the only football match between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, a first-round match during the 1974 FIFA World Cup, which the East won 1–0; but West Germany, the host, went on to win the World Cup.
East Germany had a revolutionary technology for two-stroke engines called the expansion chamber, allowing them to win motorcycle races with little competition. Racer Ernst Degner defected to Japan, taking the technology secret with him over to Suzuki. After the defection, East German motorcycle racing effectively ended.

=== Official and public holidays ===
== Legacy ==
=== Decrepit infrastructure ===
At the time of reunification, almost all East German highways, railroads, sewage systems, and public buildings were in a state of disrepair, as little was done to maintain infrastructure in the GDR&#x27;s last decades. Over the next 30 years, unified German public spending invested more than $2 trillion into former East Germany, to make up for the region&#x27;s neglect and malaise and bring it up to a minimal standard.

The Greifswald Nuclear Power Plant narrowly avoided a Chernobyl-scale meltdown in 1976. All East German nuclear power plants had to be shut down after reunification, because they did not meet Western safety standards.

=== Authoritarianism ===
German historian Jürgen Kocka in 2010 summarized the consensus of most recent scholarship:

=== Ostalgie ===

Many East Germans initially regarded the dissolution of the GDR positively, but this reaction partly turned sour. West Germans often acted as if they had &quot;won&quot; and East Germans had &quot;lost&quot; in unification, leading many East Germans (&quot;Ossis&quot;) to resent West Germans (&quot;Wessis&quot;). In 2004, Deborah Ascher Barnstone wrote, &quot;East Germans resent the wealth possessed by West Germans; West Germans see the East Germans as lazy opportunists who want something for nothing. East Germans find &#x27;Wessis&#x27; arrogant and pushy, West Germans think the &#x27;Ossis&#x27; are lazy good-for-nothings.&quot;

In addition, many East German women found the West more appealing, and left the region never to return, leaving behind an underclass of poorly educated and jobless men.

In 2009, a majority (57%) of the people who stayed in East Germany defended the GDR, with 49% of those polled saying that &quot;The GDR had more good sides than bad sides. There were some problems, but life was good there&quot;, while 8% opposed all criticism of East Germany and said that &quot;Life there was happier and better than in reunified Germany today&quot;.

As of 2014, the vast majority of residents in the former GDR prefer to live in a unified Germany. However, a feeling of nostalgia persists among some, termed &quot;Ostalgie&quot; (a blend of &quot;east&quot; and &quot;nostalgia&quot;). This was depicted in the Wolfgang Becker film &quot;Goodbye Lenin!&quot;. According to Klaus Schroeder, a historian and political scientist at the Free University of Berlin, some of the original residents of the GDR &quot;still feel they don&#x27;t belong or that they&#x27;re strangers in unified Germany&quot; as life in the GDR was &quot;just more manageable&quot;. He warns German society should watch out in case &quot;Ostalgie&quot; results in a distortion and romanticization of the past.

In 2023, a poll found that among Germans living in the former East Germany, 40% identified as &quot;East Germans&quot; and 52% identified as &quot;Germans&quot;.

=== Electoral consequences ===

The divide between the East and the West can be seen in contemporary German elections. The left-wing populist Die Linke party (which has roots in the SED) continues to have a stronghold and occasionally wins a plurality in the east, such as in the state of Thuringia where it remains one of the major parties. The region also sees disproportionate support for the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a right-wing populist party, particularly in the state of Saxony and Thuringia. This is in stark distinction to the west where the more centrist parties such as the CDU/CSU, SPD, The Greens, and the FDP dominate.

The far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) was represented in the Saxon State Parliament from 2004 to 2014. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern the NPD was represented from 2006 to 2016.

=== Demographics ===

There are more migrants in former West Germany than in former East Germany. In 2016, in every state of former East Germany, 90–95% of people did not have a migrant background.
=== Religion ===
As of 2009, more Germans are non-believers in former Eastern Germany than former Western Germany. Eastern Germany is perhaps the least religious region in the world. An explanation for this, popular in other regions, is the aggressive state atheist policies of the SED. However, the enforcement of atheism existed only for the first few years. After that, the state allowed churches to have a relatively high level of autonomy. Atheism is embraced by Germans of all ages, though irreligion is particularly common among younger Germans.

<text>Granville is a suburb in Western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Granville is located west of the Sydney central business district, split between the local government areas of Cumberland City Council and the City of Parramatta.

South Granville is a separate suburb. Lisgar, Redfern, Heath and Mona Streets form the approximate border between Granville and South Granville. The Duck River provides a boundary with Auburn, to the east.

== History ==
In 1855, the Granville area was known as Parramatta Junction, named after the final stop of the first railway line of New South Wales. The Sydney-Parramatta Line ran from Sydney terminus, just south from today&#x27;s Central railway station to the Granville area which was originally known as &#x27;Parramatta Junction&#x27;. This led to the development of this area, which attracted speculators and some local industries.

In the early days of European settlement, timber was harvested to fuel the steam engines in Sydney and Parramatta. By the 1860s, the supply of timber was exhausted. The remainder was used by scavengers who made a living by collecting firewood. Wattle bark found use with tanners and the bark from stringybark trees was used for roofing of huts. In 1862, a major estate, &quot;Drainville&quot;, became subject to a mortgagee sale and subdivided for villa homes, and small agricultures. At the end of the decade a Tweed Mill was established, which was steam powered using water from the Duck River. In 1878, the locality received its own post office, which was then part of the stationmasters house.

The name &#x27;Parramatta Junction&#x27; remained until 1880, when two public meeting voted that the name be changed. Some very strange names were suggested including &quot;Drainwell&quot;, &quot;Vauxhall&quot;, &quot;Nobbsville&quot;, and &quot;Swagsville&quot;, but finally the name of Granville in honour of the British Foreign Secretary, the Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville. Even then the voice of protest was raised declaring the name was &quot;too French&quot;, but the dissenter was ignored.

At this time, the place had a population of 372, of which 176 were male and 196 female. In this era some German settlers, Joseph Klein and P W Merkell, tried to establish vineyards in the area, but eventually found the land was not suited for this type of agriculture. More farmers discovered the limitations of the local soils and fruit growers complained about the damage from flying foxes. Thus, the only practical use for the grasslands, which replaced the original bushland, was for dairy cattle.

The Granville Municipality was formed in 1885 and the council carried on the local government of the area until 1948, when it became part of an enlarged City of Parramatta.

On Anzac Day of 1974, Granville was partially severed by flooding of the Duck Creek stormwater channel due to torrential rain that fell over the area. 135 millimetres of rain fell between 11.30 pm and 12.30 pm at Guildford, with the ensuing flood doing major damage through Granville. The nearby RSL was damaged and many of the club&#x27;s old photographs and honour boards were destroyed.

Granville is also the location of the Granville railway disaster, which occurred on 18 January 1977 when a commuter train derailed just before the Bold Street overpass and hit the stanchion, causing the bridge to collapse. 83 people perished, making it the worst rail disaster in Australian history.

== Heritage listings ==
Granville has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 10 Carlton Street: Granville Town Hall
* 157 Blaxcell Street: Crest Theatre

== Buildings and places of interest ==
Granville has a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial developments. The commercial and residential developments are mostly around Granville railway station and Parramatta Road. Granville is primarily dominated by freestanding weatherboard, fibro and unrendered brick buildings. The area is no longer exactly &quot;typical&quot; quarter acre block territory, but blocks are reasonably common. Terraced houses are rare, but increasing in number. Apartment blocks, generally three to four storeys in height, are also becoming more common in the vicinity of the railway station.

Buildings that deserve some attention are:

* &quot;Granville Town Hall&quot;, which was built in 1888
* &quot;The Royal Hotel&quot; corresponds with the architecture of the Town Hall about 200 m away
* The &quot;Former School of Arts&quot; building just north of the railway station on Good Street, built in 1883
* &quot;St. Marks Anglican Church&quot; dates back to 1882
* &quot;St. Aphanasius Church&quot;, a Ukrainian Autocephalic Orthodox with onion domes, adds some interest to William Street. It dates back to 1956.
* The &quot;White Palace&quot; in South Street has an exterior with Art Deco features. The building was gutted and redeveloped in 2007.
* The intersecting circles of &quot;Granville RSL&quot; Sub-Branch Building serves as an interesting example of modern architecture. It was designed by Frank Fox &amp; Associates.

=== Crest Theatre ===
The &quot;Crest&quot; building on the corner of Blaxcell and Redfern Streets, was built by Hoyts in 1948 as a movie theatre and was used for screening films up until 1963. The structure of the building is of a Quonset hut design, while the facade and interior is of a post-Art Deco and post-Moderne eclectic style, influenced by the &quot;Picture Palace&quot; architecture popularly used for movie theatres. It is now used as a function hall.

The Crest Theatre is now listed in the NSW State Heritage Register as being of &quot;State significance&quot;, being one of the few cinemas built in Australia in the 1940s. Externally and internally the building remains largely intact, though the signage on the external decorative pier now reads &quot;B-L-O-U-Z-A&quot;, rather than the original &quot;H-O-Y-T-S&quot; (later it was &quot;B-I-N-G-O&quot;).

== Transport ==
===Trains===
Granville railway station is a major station on the Main Western railway line. It is served by T1 Northern &amp; Western Lines and T2 Leppington &amp; Inner West Line Sydney Trains services. Granville&#x27;s bus interchange, as well as a car park, are located adjacent to its train station.

===Bus===
Granville is serviced by Transdev NSW and features a newly built bus interchange. Transdev NSW operates three bus routes via Granville railway station:
*906: Parramatta station to Fairfield station
*M91: Parramatta station to Hurstville
*S2: to Sefton

Granville station is served by one NightRide (Night Bus) route:
*N60: Fairfield station to Town Hall station

===Road===
Parramatta Road has always been an important thoroughfare for Sydney from its earliest days. From Parramatta the major western road for the state is the Great Western Highway.
The M4 Western Motorway, running parallel to the Great Western Highway has taken much of the traffic away from these roads, with entrance and exit ramps close to Parramatta.

== Education ==
Granville has a major college of Technical and Further Education, which is part of the South Western Sydney Institute of TAFE. Schools include Granville Boys High School which was founded in 1926, Delany College, Granville Public School, Granville East Public School, Blaxcell Street Public School and Holy Family Catholic School. The suburb is also home to a Cumberland Council branch library.

== Culture ==
=== Sport ===
Granville has an Olympic size pool and a football facility. Historic Garside Park is home to State Super League and Super Youth League club, Granville Rage.

Sydney Speedway is a dirt track speedway which opened in 1977 at the old Granville Showground as the Parramatta Speedway. The clay surface caters mainly to Sprintcars and has been home to some of Australia&#x27;s greatest drivers including ten times Australian Sprintcar Champion Garry Rush, and multiple title holders George Tatnell, his son Brooke Tatnell, and Max Dumesny. The speedway is also the only venue not in North or Central America to host a round of the famous World of Outlaws sprintcar series.

Granville Magpies Soccer Club entered the Sydney competition in the early 1880s and has continued to compete with distinction until the early 2000s. The club originally played matches at a paddock behind Hudson Brothers&#x27; Works in Clyde before relocating to Macarthur Park, known nowadays as F.S. Garside Park.

<doc id="13062" wikidata="Q75854" url="?curid=13062" title="Georg Philipp Telemann">
<text>Georg Philipp Telemann (; – 25 June 1767) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist. He is one of the most prolific composers in history, at least in terms of surviving oeuvre. Telemann was considered by his contemporaries to be one of the leading German composers of the time, and he was compared favourably both to his friend Johann Sebastian Bach, who made Telemann the godfather and namesake of his son Carl Philipp Emanuel, and to George Frideric Handel, whom Telemann also knew personally.

Almost completely self-taught in music, he became a composer against his family&#x27;s wishes. After studying in Magdeburg, Zellerfeld, and Hildesheim, Telemann entered the University of Leipzig to study law, but eventually settled on a career in music. He held important positions in Leipzig, Sorau, Eisenach, and Frankfurt before settling in Hamburg in 1721, where he became musical director of that city&#x27;s five main churches. While Telemann&#x27;s career prospered, his personal life was always troubled: his first wife died less than two years after their marriage, and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving him. As part of his duties, he wrote a considerable amount of music for educating organists under his direction. This includes 48 chorale preludes and 20 small fugues (modal fugues) to accompany his chorale harmonisations for 500 hymns. His music incorporates French, Italian, and German national styles, and he was at times even influenced by Polish popular music. He remained at the forefront of all new musical tendencies, and his music stands as an important link between the late Baroque and early Classical styles. The Telemann Museum in Hamburg is dedicated to him.
==Life==
===Early life (1681–1712)===
Telemann was born in Magdeburg, then the capital of the semi-autonomous Duchy of Magdeburg within the Electorate of Brandenburg, in the Holy Roman Empire. His father Heinrich, deacon at the , died when Telemann was four. The future composer received his first music lessons at 10, from a local organist, and became immensely interested in music in general, and composition in particular. Despite opposition from his mother and relatives, who forbade any musical activities, Telemann found it possible to study and composed in secret, even creating an opera at the age of 12.

In 1697, after studies at the Domschule in Magdeburg and at a school in Zellerfeld, Telemann was sent to the famous Gymnasium Andreanum at Hildesheim, where his musical talent flourished, supported by school authorities, including the rector himself. Telemann was becoming equally adept both at composing and performing, teaching himself flute, oboe, violin, viola da gamba, recorder, double bass, and other instruments. In 1701 he graduated from the Gymnasium and went to Leipzig to become a student at the Leipzig University, where he intended to study law. He ended up becoming a professional musician, regularly composing works for the Nikolaikirche and even St. Thomas (Thomaskirche). In 1702 he became director of the municipal opera house &quot;Opernhaus auf dem Brühl&quot;, and later music director at the Neukirche. Prodigiously productive, Telemann supplied a wealth of new music for Leipzig, including several operas, one of which was his first major opera, &quot;Germanicus&quot;. However, he became engaged in a conflict with the cantor of the Thomaskirche, Johann Kuhnau. The conflict intensified when Telemann started employing numerous students for his projects, including those who were Kuhnau&#x27;s, from the Thomasschule.

Telemann left Leipzig in 1705 at the age of 24, after receiving an invitation to become &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; for the court of Count Erdmann II of Promnitz at Sorau (now Żary, Poland). His career there was cut short in early 1706 by the hostilities of the Great Northern War, and after a short period of travels he entered the service of Duke Johann Wilhelm, in Eisenach where Johann Sebastian Bach was born. He became &quot;Konzertmeister&quot; on 24 December 1708 and Secretary and &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; in August 1709. During his tenure at Eisenach, Telemann wrote a great deal of music: at least four annual cycles of church cantatas, dozens of sonatas and concertos, and other works. In 1709, he married Amalie Louise Juliane Eberlin, lady-in-waiting to the Countess of Promnitz and daughter of the musician Daniel Eberlin. Their daughter was born in January 1711. The mother died soon afterwards, leaving Telemann depressed and distraught.

===Frankfurt (1712–1721)===
After around a year he sought another position, and moved to Frankfurt on 18 March 1712 at the age of 31 to become city music director and &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; at the and St. Catherine&#x27;s Church. In Frankfurt, he fully gained his mature personal style. Here, as in Leipzig, he was a powerful force in the city&#x27;s musical life, creating music for two major churches, civic ceremonies, and various ensembles and musicians. By 1720 he had adopted the use of the da capo aria, which had been adopted by composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti. Operas such as &quot;Narciso&quot;, which was brought to Frankfurt in 1719, written in the Italian idiom of composition, made a mark on Telemann&#x27;s output.

On 28 August 1714, three years after his first wife had died, Telemann married again, Maria Catharina Textor, daughter of a Frankfurt council clerk. They eventually had nine children. This was a source of much personal happiness, and helped him produce compositions. Telemann continued to be extraordinarily productive and successful, even augmenting his income by working for Eisenach employers as a &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; &quot;von Haus aus&quot;, that is, regularly sending new music while not actually living in Eisenach. Telemann&#x27;s first published works also appeared during the Frankfurt period. His output increased rapidly, for he fervently composed overture-suites and chamber music, most of which is unappreciated. These works included his 6 Sonatas for solo violin, known as the &quot;Frankfurt Sonatas&quot;, published in 1715. In the latter half of the Frankfurt period, he composed an innovative work, his Viola Concerto in G major, which is twice the length of his violin concertos. Also, here he composed his first choral masterpiece, his &quot;Brockes Passion&quot;, in 1716.

===Hamburg (1721–1767)===
Telemann accepted the invitation to work in Hamburg as &quot;Kantor&quot; of the Johanneum Lateinschule, and music director of the five largest churches in 1721. Soon after arrival, Telemann encountered some opposition from church officials who found his secular music and activities to be too much of a distraction for both Telemann himself and the townsfolk. The next year, when Johann Kuhnau died and the city of Leipzig was looking for a new &quot;Thomaskantor&quot;, Telemann applied for the job and was approved, yet declined after Hamburg authorities agreed to give him a suitable raise. After another candidate, Christoph Graupner, declined, the post went to Johann Sebastian Bach.
Telemann took a few small trips outside Germany at this time. However, later in the Hamburg period he travelled to Paris and stayed for eight months, 1737 into 1738. He heard and was impressed by &quot;Castor et Pollux&quot;, an opera by French composer Jean-Philippe Rameau. From then on, he incorporated the French operatic style into his vocal works. Before then, his influence was primarily Italian and German. Apart from that, Telemann remained in Hamburg for the rest of his life. A vocal masterpiece of this period is his &quot;St Luke Passion&quot; from 1728, which is a prime example of his fully matured vocal style.

His first years there were plagued by marital troubles: his wife&#x27;s infidelity, and her gambling debts, which amounted to a sum larger than Telemann&#x27;s annual income. The composer was saved from bankruptcy by the efforts of his friends, and by the numerous successful music and poetry publications Telemann made during the years 1725 to 1740. By 1736 husband and wife were no longer living together because of their financial disagreements. Although still active and fulfilling the many duties of his job, Telemann became less productive in the 1740s, when he was in his 60s. He took up theoretical studies, as well as hobbies such as gardening and cultivating exotic plants, something of a fad in Hamburg at that time, and a hobby shared by Handel.
Most of the music of the 1750s appears to have been parodied from earlier works. Telemann&#x27;s eldest son Andreas died in 1755, and Andreas&#x27; son Georg Michael Telemann was raised by the aging composer. Troubled by health problems and failing eyesight in his last years, Telemann was still composing into the 1760s. He died on the evening of 25 June 1767 from what was recorded at the time as a &quot;chest ailment.&quot; He was succeeded at his Hamburg post by his godson, Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s second son Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach.

==Legacy and influence==
Telemann was one of the most prolific major composers of all time: his all-encompassing oeuvre comprises more than 3,000 compositions, half of which have been lost, and most of which have not been performed since the 18th century. From 1708 to 1750, Telemann composed 1,043 sacred cantatas and 600 overture-suites, and types of concertos for combinations of instruments that no other composer of the time employed. The first accurate estimate of the number of his works was provided by musicologists only during the 1980s and 1990s, when extensive thematic catalogues were published. During his lifetime and the latter half of the 18th century, Telemann was very highly regarded by colleagues and critics alike. Numerous theorists (Marpurg, Mattheson, Quantz, and Scheibe, among others) cited his works as models, and major composers such as J.S. Bach and Handel bought and studied his published works. He was immensely popular not only in Germany but also in the rest of Europe: orders for editions of Telemann&#x27;s music came from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, and Spain. It was only in the early 19th century that his popularity came to a sudden halt. Most lexicographers started dismissing him as a &quot;polygraph&quot; who composed too many works, a &quot;Vielschreiber&quot; for whom quantity came before quality. Such views were influenced by an account of Telemann&#x27;s music by Christoph Daniel Ebeling, a late-18th-century critic who in fact praised Telemann&#x27;s music and made only passing critical remarks of his productivity. After the Bach revival, Telemann&#x27;s works were judged as inferior to Bach&#x27;s and lacking in deep religious feeling. For example, by 1911, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; lacked an article about Telemann, and in one of its few mentions of him referred to &quot;the vastly inferior work of lesser composers such as Telemann&quot; in comparison to Handel and Bach.

Particularly striking examples of such judgements were produced by noted Bach biographers Philipp Spitta and Albert Schweitzer, who criticized Telemann&#x27;s cantatas and then praised works they thought were composed by Bach, but which were composed by Telemann. The last performance of a substantial work by Telemann (&quot;Der Tod Jesu&quot;) occurred in 1832, and it was not until the 20th century that his music started being performed again. The revival of interest in Telemann began in the first decades of the 20th century and culminated in the Bärenreiter critical edition of the 1950s. Today each of Telemann&#x27;s works is usually given a TWV number, which stands for &quot;Telemann-Werke-Verzeichnis&quot; (Telemann Works Catalogue).

Telemann&#x27;s music was one of the driving forces behind the late Baroque and the early Classical styles. Starting in the 1710s he became one of the creators and foremost exponents of the so-called German mixed style, an amalgam of German, French, Italian and Polish styles. Over the years, his music gradually changed and started incorporating more and more elements of the galant musical style, but he never completely adopted the ideals of the nascent Classical era: Telemann&#x27;s style remained contrapuntally and harmonically complex, and already in 1751 he dismissed much contemporary music as too simplistic. Composers he influenced musically included pupils of J.S. Bach in Leipzig, such as Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach and Johann Friedrich Agricola, as well as those composers who performed under his direction in Leipzig (Christoph Graupner, Johann David Heinichen and Johann Georg Pisendel), composers of the Berlin &quot;lieder&quot; school, and finally, his numerous pupils, none of whom, however, became major composers.

Equally significant for the history of music were Telemann&#x27;s publishing activities. By pursuing exclusive publication rights for his works, he set one of the most important early precedents for regarding music as the intellectual property of the composer. The same attitude informed his public concerts, where Telemann frequently performed music originally composed for ceremonies attended only by a select few members of the upper class.

<text>The Granville rail disaster occurred on Tuesday 18 January 1977 at Granville, a western suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, when a crowded commuter train derailed, running into the supports of a road bridge that collapsed onto two of the train&#x27;s passenger carriages.

While the official inquiry found the primary cause of the crash to be poor fastening of the track, there were a number of factors that were identified as contributing to the accident.

It remains the worst rail disaster in Australian history; 83 people died and 213 were injured. An 84th victim, an unborn child, was added to the fatality list in 2017.

==Disaster==
The train involved in the disaster consisted of eight wooden bodied Supplementary Interurban Passenger Carriages, which had been converted from country passenger stock by the PTC, which were hauled by 46 class electric locomotive 4620, which had commenced its journey towards Sydney from Mount Victoria in the Blue Mountains at 6:09 a.m.

At approximately 8:10 a.m. it was approaching Granville railway station when the locomotive derailed and struck one of the steel-and-concrete pillars supporting the bridge carrying Bold Street over the railway cutting.

The derailed engine and first two carriages passed the bridge, with the first carriage being separated free from the other carriages and torn open when it collided with a severed overhead stanchion from beside the track, killing eight passengers instantly.

The remaining carriages (cars 2 to 8) came to a halt with the second carriage clear of the bridge, and the rear half of the third carriage, along with the forward half of the fourth carriage, coming to rest under the weakened bridge, whose weight was estimated at . Carriages 5, 6, 7 and 8 were clear of the bridge at the Harris Park (or country side) of the bridge and were not affected by the incident other than passengers suffering minor injuries or from the shock of being involved in the incident.

Within 15 seconds, with the majority of its supports demolished, the bridge including several motor cars that were driving across at the time, collapsed on top of the carriages, demolishing their wooden bodies and crushing the passengers inside.
Of the total number of passengers travelling in the third and fourth carriages, half were killed instantly when the bridge fell on them, crushing them in their seats, some to the point where their head and shoulders were below the level of their knees.

Of the 213 injured, some of the trapped were in the train for hours after the accident, with parts of the bridge, parts of the carriage body, broken carriage seating, or deceased passengers crushing them, hampering rescuers. Some of these injured had been conscious and lucid, talking to rescuers and explaining their experiences of the event, however, most died of crush syndrome soon after the weight was removed from their bodies.

Rescuers also faced the greater difficulty of the weight of the bridge, which was still crushing the affected carriages and reducing the available space in which they could work in to rescue survivors. At one stage of the rescue, a declaration was made by those in charge that no one was permitted to attempt further rescues until the collapsed bridge had been lifted clear of the site. Soon after however, the bridge settled a further onto the train, trapping two rescuers and crushing a portable generator &quot;like butter&quot;.

Another major danger came from Liquid Petroleum Gas, as LPG cylinders were being kept year-round on board the train to be used in the winters for heating purposes.

Several of the deceased were overcome by the gas leaking from ruptured cylinders, reducing the amount of available breathable air in the area underneath the bridge.

This leaking gas also prevented the immediate use of powered rescue tools such as petrol powered saws and cutting equipment due to the risk of explosion.

The NSW Fire Brigade provided enough ventilation equipment to dispel the gas, as well as a constant mist/film of water, sprayed over the accident site to prevent the possibility of the gas ignition.

The train driver, the assistant crewman (the &quot;second man&quot;), and the motorists including one motorcyclist driving on the fallen bridge all survived.

The operation lasted from 8:12 a.m. Tuesday until 6:00 a.m. Thursday. Ultimately, 84 people were killed in the accident, including an unborn child.
==Aftermath==
The Bold Street Bridge was rebuilt as a single span without any intermediate support piers, and other bridges similar to the destroyed bridge had their piers reinforced.
The original inquiry into the accident found that the primary cause of the crash was &quot;the very unsatisfactory condition of the permanent way&quot;, being the poor fastening of the track, causing the track to spread and allowing the left front wheel of the locomotive to come off the rail.

However, it was found that there were other contributing factors that included the structure of the bridge itself, the condition of the track, and the condition of the locomotive.

When built, the base of the Bold Street Bridge was found to be one metre lower than the road surface at each adjoining street. In order to bring the bridge road surface up to the same height as the street concrete was added on top to remove the difference. This additional weight, adding almost triple the originally designed weight of the bridge, significantly added to the destruction of the wooden train carriages.

It was found that the track immediately prior to the curve leading into the area of Bold Street Bridge had not been maintained correctly, leading to the locomotives&#x27; wheels to push the track out of gauge, which led to the front right-hand wheel to leave the track, effectively derailing the locomotive.

Locomotive 4620 had been involved in a similar accident twelve years earlier, when it had derailed at Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains when operating a freight service. 4620 &#x27;jumped the tracks&#x27; as it entered the loop at the western end (country side) of Wentworth Falls platform, resulting in the entire train derailing. The cause was found to be an irregular operation of the train brake pipe. After being recovered from this accident, 4620 had the dents and scratches repaired and placed back into service.

The carriages involved were wooden bodied Supplementary Interurban Passenger Carriages, which had been converted from Country Passenger Stock by the PTC to Interurban Passenger stock. This was done by removing the previous internal arrangement of individual compartments and making the carriages an &#x27;open plan&#x27; similar to how passenger stock is today. This left the cars with only the side and end walls supporting the roof instead of a number of internal walls bearing the weight of the roof. It is entirely possible that if the cars had been left as built, with individual compartments, then whilst the collapse of the bridge would have crushed the carriages, the internal walls could have prevented the cars from being completely destroyed, enabling passenger to survive in pockets rather than simply being crushed.

The disaster prompted substantial increases in rail-maintenance expenditure, something that had been experiencing a deficiency decline since the Second World War due to the reduction available of materials, finances, and labour forces. The Public Transport Commission of NSW soon after the accident immediately began a systematic process of track maintenance in order to prevent another incident like this from occurring.

The train driver, Edward Olencewicz, was exonerated by the inquiry due to the exhaustive investigation into the incident.

Due to the Granville Rail Disaster and the number of victims who suffered from crush syndrome (a little understood medical condition at the time), a number of changes were made as to how crush injuries are dealt with by rescue personnel, not only at incidents such as this, but also for smaller rescues as well.

On 4 May 2017, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian apologised to the victims of the disaster, in Parliament House after extensive pushing for the apology.

After the 2023 New South Wales state election, the incoming Labor Government discovered that the previous Liberal/National Coalition Government had been deferring essential maintenance on many levels of the Sydney Trains network. It was found that some infrastructure, including track and overhead bridges, had been seriously under financed over a number of years, reducing the network to the point where another accident similar to Granville would occur. The Minns Government immediately began a review (the Sydney Trains Review) into the network which has resulted in 1,900 high priority defects and 800 kilometres of rail repaired between 3 June 2023 and 4 December 2023, leaving the project ahead of its twelve month schedule. 

===Memorial===

Families and friends of the victims and survivors gather with surviving members of the rescue crews annually. The ceremony ends with the throwing of 84 roses on to the tracks to mark the number of passengers killed. In 2007, a plaque was placed on the bridge to mark the efforts of railway workers who assisted in rescuing survivors from the train.

The original group, known as &#x27;the trust&#x27;, made submissions on rail safety issues, including recommending that fines for safety breaches be dedicated to rail safety improvements, and campaigning for the establishment of an independent railway safety ombudsman.

<text>George Gershwin (; born Jacob Gershwine; September 26, 1898 – July 11, 1937) was an American composer and pianist whose compositions spanned popular, jazz and classical genres. Among his best-known works are the orchestral compositions &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (1924) and &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1928), the songs &quot;Swanee&quot; (1919) and &quot;Fascinating Rhythm&quot; (1924), the jazz standards &quot;Embraceable You&quot; (1928) and &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; (1930), and the opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1935), which included the hit &quot;Summertime&quot;.

Gershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark, Henry Cowell, and Joseph Brody. He began his career as a song plugger but soon started composing Broadway theater works with his brother Ira Gershwin and with Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris, intending to study with Nadia Boulanger, but she refused him, afraid that rigorous classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style; Maurice Ravel voiced similar objections when Gershwin inquired about studying with him. He subsequently composed &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, returned to New York City and wrote &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; with Ira and DuBose Heyward. Initially a commercial failure, it came to be considered one of the most important American operas of the 20th century and an American cultural classic.

Gershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous film scores. He died in 1937, only 38 years old, of a brain tumor. His compositions have been adapted for use in film and television, with many becoming jazz standards.

==Biography==
===Ancestors===
Gershwin&#x27;s parents were both Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. His paternal grandfather, Jakov Gershowitz, was born in Odessa, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), and had served for 25 years as a mechanic for the Imperial Russian Army to earn the right of free travel and residence as a Jew, finally retiring near Saint Petersburg, Russia. Jakov&#x27;s teenage son, Moishe, George Gershwin&#x27;s father, worked as a leather cutter for women&#x27;s shoes. Moishe&#x27;s wife-to-be, George&#x27;s mother-to-be, Roza Bruskina, was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Moishe met Roza in Vilna, Russian Empire (now Vilnius, Lithuania), where her father worked as a furrier. She and her family moved to New York because of increasing anti-Jewish sentiment in Russia, changing her first name to Rose. Moishe, faced with compulsory military service if he remained in Russia, moved to America as soon as he could afford to (arrived on August 14, 1890). Once in New York, he changed his first name to Morris. Gershowitz lived with a maternal uncle in Brooklyn, working as a foreman in a women&#x27;s shoe factory. He married Rose on July 21, 1895, and Gershowitz soon Anglicized his name to Gershwine. Their first child, Ira Gershwin, was born on December 6, 1896, after which the family moved into a second-floor apartment at 242 Snediker Avenue in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn.

===Early life===
George was born on September 26, 1898, in the Snediker Avenue apartment. His birth certificate identifies him as Jacob Gershwine, with the surname pronounced &quot;Gersh-vin&quot; in the Russian and Yiddish immigrant community. He was named after his grandfather, and, contrary to the American practice, had no middle name. He soon became known as George, and changed the spelling of his surname to &quot;Gershwin&quot; around the time he became a professional musician; other family members followed suit after Ira and George, another boy, Arthur Gershwin (1900–1981), and a girl, Frances Gershwin (1906–1999), were born into the family. The family lived in many different residences, as their father changed dwellings with each new enterprise in which he became involved. They grew up mostly in the Yiddish Theater District. George and Ira frequented the local Yiddish theaters, with George occasionally appearing onstage as an extra.

George lived a boyhood not unusual in New York tenements, which included running around with his friends, roller-skating and misbehaving in the streets. Until 1908, he cared nothing about music. Then, as a ten-year-old, he was intrigued upon hearing his friend Maxie Rosenzweig&#x27;s violin recital. The sound, and the way his friend played, captivated him. At about the same time, George&#x27;s parents had bought a piano for his older brother Ira. To his parents&#x27; surprise, though, and to Ira&#x27;s relief, it was George who spent more time playing it as he continued to enjoy it.

Although his younger sister Frances Gershwin was the first in the family to make a living through her musical talents, she married young and devoted herself to being a mother and housewife, thus precluding spending any serious time on musical endeavors. Having given up her performing career, she settled upon painting as a creative outlet, which had also been a hobby George briefly pursued. Arthur Gershwin followed in the paths of George and Ira, also becoming a composer of songs, musicals, and short piano pieces. George studied with various piano teachers for about two years (circa 1911) before finally being introduced to Charles Hambitzer by Jack Miller (circa 1913), the pianist in the Beethoven Symphony Orchestra. Until his death in 1918, Hambitzer remained Gershwin&#x27;s musical mentor, taught him conventional piano technique, introduced him to music of the European classical tradition, and encouraged him to attend orchestral concerts.

===Tin Pan Alley and Broadway: 1913–1923===
In 1913, Gershwin left school at the age of 15 to work as a &quot;song plugger&quot; on New York City&#x27;s Tin Pan Alley. He earned $15 a week from Jerome H. Remick and Company, a Detroit-based publishing firm with a branch office in New York. His first published song was &quot;When You Want &#x27;Em, You Can&#x27;t Get &#x27;Em, When You&#x27;ve Got &#x27;Em, You Don&#x27;t Want &#x27;Em&quot; in 1916. It earned the 17-year-old 50 cents.

In 1916, Gershwin started working for Aeolian Company and Standard Music Rolls in New York City, recording and arranging. He produced dozens, if not hundreds, of rolls under his own and assumed names (pseudonyms attributed to Gershwin include Fred Murtha and Bert Wynn). He also recorded rolls of his own compositions for the Duo-Art and Welte-Mignon reproducing pianos. As well as recording piano rolls, Gershwin made a brief foray into vaudeville, accompanying both Nora Bayes and Louise Dresser on the piano. His first song to appear on Broadway was &quot;Making of a Girl&quot;, written in 1916 with Sigmund Romberg and lyrics by Harold Atteridge. It was sung in The Passing Show of 1916. His 1917 novelty ragtime, &quot;Rialto Ripples&quot;, was a commercial success. In addition to his musical activities, he took over the management of the popular and famous gay bathhouse Lafayette Baths together with his brother Ira.

In 1919, Gershwin scored his first big national hit with his song &quot;Swanee&quot;, with words by Irving Caesar. Al Jolson, a Broadway star and former minstrel singer, heard Gershwin perform &quot;Swanee&quot; at a party and decided to sing it in one of his shows. In the late 1910s, Gershwin met songwriter and music director William Daly. The two collaborated on the Broadway musicals &quot;Piccadilly to Broadway&quot; (1920) and &quot;For Goodness&#x27; Sake&quot; (1922), and jointly composed the score for &quot;Our Nell&quot; (1923). This was the beginning of a long friendship. Daly was a frequent arranger, orchestrator and conductor of Gershwin&#x27;s music, and Gershwin periodically turned to him for musical advice.

===Musical, Europe and classical music: 1924–1928===
In 1924, Gershwin composed his first major work, &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, for orchestra and piano. It was orchestrated by Ferde Grofé and premiered by Paul Whiteman&#x27;s Concert Band, in New York. It subsequently went on to be his most popular work, and established Gershwin&#x27;s signature style and genius in blending vastly different musical styles, including jazz and classical, in revolutionary ways.

Since the early 1920s, Gershwin had frequently worked with the lyricist Buddy DeSylva. Together they created the experimental one-act jazz opera &quot;Blue Monday,&quot; set in Harlem. It is widely regarded as a forerunner to the groundbreaking &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; introduced in 1935. In 1924, George and Ira Gershwin collaborated on a stage musical comedy &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;, which included such future standards as &quot;Fascinating Rhythm&quot; and &quot;Oh, Lady Be Good!&quot;. They followed this with &quot;Oh, Kay!&quot; (1926), &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1927) and &quot;Strike Up the Band&quot; (1927 and 1930). Gershwin allowed the latter song, with a modified title, to be used as a football fight song, &quot;Strike Up The Band for UCLA&quot;.

In the mid-1920s, Gershwin stayed in Paris for a short period, during which he applied to study composition with the noted Nadia Boulanger, who, along with several other prospective tutors such as Maurice Ravel, turned him down, afraid that rigorous classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style. Maurice Ravel&#x27;s rejection letter to Gershwin told him, &quot;Why become a second-rate Ravel when you&#x27;re already a first-rate Gershwin?&quot; While there, Gershwin wrote &quot;An American in Paris&quot;. This work received mixed reviews upon its first performance at Carnegie Hall on December 13, 1928, but it quickly became part of the standard repertoire in Europe and the United States.

===New York: 1929–1935===
In 1929, the Gershwin brothers created &quot;Show Girl&quot;; the following year brought &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;, which introduced the standards &quot;Embraceable You&quot;, sung by Ginger Rogers, and &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;. 1931&#x27;s &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; became the first musical comedy to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama; the winners were George S. Kaufman, Morrie Ryskind, and Ira Gershwin. Gershwin spent the summer of 1934 on Folly Island in South Carolina after he was invited to visit by the author of the novel &quot;Porgy&quot;, DuBose Heyward. He was inspired to write the music to his opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; while on this working vacation&quot;.&quot; &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was considered another American classic by the composer of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; — even if critics could not quite figure out how to evaluate it, or decide whether it was opera or simply an ambitious Broadway musical. &quot;It crossed the barriers,&quot; per theater historian Robert Kimball. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a musical work per se, and it wasn&#x27;t a drama per se – it elicited response from both music and drama critics. But the work has sort of always been outside category.&quot;

===Last years: 1936–1937===
After the commercial failure of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, Gershwin moved to Hollywood, California. In 1936, he was commissioned by RKO Pictures to write the music for the film &quot;Shall We Dance&quot;, starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Gershwin&#x27;s extended score, which would marry ballet with jazz in a new way, runs over an hour. It took Gershwin several months to compose and orchestrate. Gershwin had a ten-year affair with composer Kay Swift, whom he frequently consulted about his music. The two never married, although she eventually divorced her husband James Warburg to commit to the relationship. Swift&#x27;s granddaughter, Katharine Weber, has suggested that the pair were not married because George&#x27;s mother Rose was &quot;unhappy that Kay Swift wasn&#x27;t Jewish&quot;. The Gershwins&#x27; 1926 musical &quot;Oh, Kay&quot; was named for her. After Gershwin&#x27;s death, Swift arranged some of his music, transcribed several of his recordings, and collaborated with his brother Ira on several projects.

===Illness and death===
Early in 1937, Gershwin began to complain of blinding headaches and a recurring impression that he smelled burning rubber. As early as February 1934, he had said he smelled burning garbage at the Detroit railway station, though those with him did not. On February 11, 1937, he performed his Piano Concerto in F in a special concert of his music with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra under the direction of French maestro Pierre Monteux. Gershwin, normally a superb pianist in his own compositions, suffered coordination problems and blackouts during the performance. He was at the time working on other Hollywood film projects while living with Ira and his wife Leonore in their rented house in Beverly Hills. Leonore Gershwin began to be disturbed by George&#x27;s mood swings and his seeming inability to eat without spilling food at the dinner table. She suspected mental illness and insisted he be moved out of their house to lyricist Yip Harburg&#x27;s empty quarters nearby, where he was placed in the care of his valet, Paul Mueller. The headaches and olfactory hallucinations continued.

On the night of July 9, 1937, Gershwin collapsed in Harburg&#x27;s house, where he had been working on the score of &quot;The Goldwyn Follies&quot;. He was rushed to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, and fell into a coma. Only then did his doctors come to believe that he was suffering from a brain tumor. Leonore called George&#x27;s close friend Emil Mosbacher and explained the dire need to find a neurosurgeon. Mosbacher immediately called pioneering neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in Boston, who, retired for several years by then, recommended Walter Dandy, who was on a boat fishing in the Chesapeake Bay with Harry Nice, the governor of Maryland. Mosbacher called the White House and had a Coast Guard cutter sent to find the governor&#x27;s yacht and bring Dandy quickly to shore.
Mosbacher then chartered a plane and flew Dandy to Newark Airport, where he was to catch a plane to Los Angeles; by that time, Gershwin&#x27;s condition was critical and the need for surgery was immediate. Before Dandy could arrive, in the early hours of Sunday, July 11, 1937, doctors at Cedars removed a large brain tumor, believed to have been a glioblastoma, but Gershwin died that morning at the age of 38. The fact that he had suddenly collapsed and become comatose after he stood up on July 9 has been interpreted as brain herniation with Duret hemorrhages.

Gershwin&#x27;s friends and admirers were devastated. John O&#x27;Hara remarked: &quot;George Gershwin died on July 11, 1937, but I don&#x27;t have to believe that if I don&#x27;t want to.&quot; He was interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. A memorial concert was held at the Hollywood Bowl on September 8, 1937, at which Otto Klemperer conducted his own orchestration of the second of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Three Preludes&quot;.

==Musical style and influence==

Gershwin was influenced by French composers of the early twentieth century. In turn Maurice Ravel was impressed with Gershwin&#x27;s abilities, commenting, &quot;Personally I find jazz most interesting: the rhythms, the way the melodies are handled, the melodies themselves. I have heard of George Gershwin&#x27;s works and I find them intriguing.&quot; The orchestrations in Gershwin&#x27;s symphonic works often seem similar to those of Ravel; likewise, Ravel&#x27;s two piano concertos evince an influence of Gershwin.

George Gershwin asked to study with Ravel. When Ravel heard how much Gershwin earned, Ravel replied with words to the effect of, &quot;You should give &quot;me&quot; lessons.&quot; (Some versions of this story feature Igor Stravinsky rather than Ravel as the composer; however Stravinsky confirmed that he originally heard the story from Ravel.)

Gershwin&#x27;s own &quot;Concerto in F&quot; was criticized for being related to the work of Claude Debussy, more than to the expected jazz style. The comparison did not deter him from continuing to explore French styles. The title of &quot;An American in Paris&quot; reflects the very journey that he had consciously taken as a composer: &quot;The opening part will be developed in typical French style, in the manner of Debussy and &quot;Les Six&quot;, though the tunes are original.&quot;

Gershwin was intrigued by the works of Alban Berg, Dmitri Shostakovich, Igor Stravinsky, Darius Milhaud, and Arnold Schoenberg. He also asked Schoenberg for composition lessons. Schoenberg refused, saying &quot;I would only make you a bad Schoenberg, and you&#x27;re such a good Gershwin already.&quot; (This quote is similar to one credited to Maurice Ravel during Gershwin&#x27;s 1928 visit to France – &quot;Why be a second-rate Ravel, when you are a first-rate Gershwin?&quot;) Gershwin was particularly impressed by the music of Berg, who gave him a score of the &quot;Lyric Suite&quot;. He attended the American premiere of &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, conducted by Leopold Stokowski in 1931, and was &quot;thrilled and deeply impressed&quot;.

Russian Joseph Schillinger&#x27;s influence as Gershwin&#x27;s teacher of composition (1932–1936) was substantial in providing him with a method of composition. There has been some disagreement about the nature of Schillinger&#x27;s influence on Gershwin. After the posthumous success of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, Schillinger claimed he had a large and direct influence in overseeing the creation of the opera; Ira completely denied that his brother had any such assistance for this work. A third account of Gershwin&#x27;s musical relationship with his teacher was written by Gershwin&#x27;s close friend Vernon Duke, also a Schillinger student, in an article for &quot;the Musical Quarterly&quot; in 1947.

What set Gershwin apart was his ability to manipulate forms of music into his own unique voice. He took the jazz he discovered on Tin Pan Alley into the mainstream by splicing its rhythms and tonality with that of the popular songs of his era. Although George Gershwin would seldom make grand statements about his music, he believed that &quot;true music must reflect the thought and aspirations of the people and time. My people are Americans. My time is today.&quot;

In 2007, the Library of Congress named its Gershwin Prize for Popular Song after George and Ira Gershwin. Recognizing the profound and positive effect of popular music on culture, the prize is given annually to a composer or performer whose lifetime contributions exemplify the standard of excellence associated with the Gershwins. On March 1, 2007, the first Gershwin Prize was awarded to Paul Simon.

==Recordings and film==
Early in his career, under both his own name and pseudonyms, Gershwin recorded more than one hundred forty player piano rolls which were a main source of his income. The majority were popular music of the period and a smaller proportion were of his own works. Once his musical theater-writing income became substantial, his regular roll-recording career became superfluous. He did record additional rolls throughout the 1920s of his main hits for the Aeolian Company&#x27;s reproducing piano, including a complete version of his &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. Compared to the piano rolls, there are few accessible audio recordings of Gershwin&#x27;s playing. His first recording was his own &quot;Swanee&quot; with the Fred Van Eps Trio in 1919. The recorded balance highlights the banjo playing of Van Eps, and the piano is overshadowed. The recording took place before &quot;Swanee&quot; became famous as an Al Jolson specialty in early 1920. Gershwin recorded an abridged version of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; with Paul Whiteman and his orchestra for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1924, soon after the world premiere. Gershwin and the same orchestra made an electrical recording of the abridged version for Victor in 1927. However, a dispute in the studio over interpretation angered Whiteman and he walked out on the session. Victor&#x27;s staff conductor and arranger Nathaniel Shilkret led the orchestra, though Whiteman is still credited as conductor on the original record labels.

Gershwin made a number of solo piano recordings of tunes from his musicals, some including the vocals of Fred and Adele Astaire, as well as his &quot;Three Preludes&quot; for piano. In 1929, Gershwin &quot;supervised&quot; the world premiere recording of &quot;An American in Paris&quot; with Nathaniel Shilkret and the Victor Symphony Orchestra. Gershwin&#x27;s role in the recording was rather limited, particularly because Shilkret was conducting and had his own ideas about the music. When it was realized that no one had been hired to play the brief celeste solo, Gershwin was asked if he could and would play the instrument, and he agreed. Gershwin can be heard, rather briefly, on the recording during the slow section. Gershwin also appeared on several radio programs, including Rudy Vallee&#x27;s, and played some of his compositions. This included the third movement of the &quot;Concerto in F&quot; with Vallee conducting the studio orchestra. Some of these performances were preserved on transcription discs and have been released on LP and CD.

In 1934, in an effort to earn money to finance his planned folk opera, Gershwin hosted his own radio program titled &quot;Music by Gershwin&quot;. The show was broadcast on the NBC Blue Network from February to May and again in September through the final show on December 23, 1934. He presented his own work as well as the work of other composers. Recordings from this and other radio broadcasts include his &quot;Variations on I Got Rhythm&quot;, portions of the &quot;Concerto in F&quot;, and numerous songs from his musical comedies. He also recorded a run-through of his &quot;Second Rhapsody&quot;, conducting the orchestra and playing the piano solos. Gershwin recorded excerpts from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; with members of the original cast, conducting the orchestra from the keyboard; he even announced the selections and the names of the performers. In 1935, RCA Victor asked him to supervise recordings of highlights from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;; these were his last recordings.

RCA Victor issued a 5 record 12-inch 78 rpm Memorial Album (C-29) recorded from the RCA Magic Key program broadcast on July 10, 1938, over the NBC Radio Network. It featured the Victor Salon Group conducted by Nathaniel Shilkret and singer Jane Froman. A 74-second newsreel film clip of Gershwin playing &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; has survived, filmed at the opening of the Manhattan Theater (now The Ed Sullivan Theater) in August 1931. There are also silent home movies of Gershwin, some of them shot on Kodachrome color film stock, which have been featured in tributes to the composer. In addition, there is newsreel footage of Gershwin playing &quot;Mademoiselle from New Rochelle&quot; and &quot;Strike Up the Band&quot; on the piano during a Broadway rehearsal of the 1930 production of &quot;Strike Up the Band&quot;. In the mid-30s, &quot;Strike Up The Band&quot; was given to UCLA to be used as a football fight song, &quot;Strike Up The Band for UCLA&quot;. The comedy team of Clark and McCullough are seen conversing with Gershwin, then singing as he plays.
In 1945, the film biography &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; was made, starring Robert Alda as George Gershwin. The film contains many factual errors about Gershwin&#x27;s life, but also features many examples of his music, including an almost complete performance of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. In 1965, Movietone Records released an album MTM 1009 featuring Gershwin&#x27;s piano rolls of the titled &quot;George Gershwin plays RHAPSODY IN BLUE and his other favorite compositions&quot;. The B-side of the LP featured nine other recordings. In 1975, Columbia Records released an album featuring Gershwin&#x27;s piano rolls of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, accompanied by the Columbia Jazz Band playing the original jazz band accompaniment, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas. The B-side of the Columbia Masterworks release features Tilson Thomas leading the New York Philharmonic in &quot;An American in Paris.&quot; In 1976, RCA Records reissued a collection of Gershwin&#x27;s original recordings on the album &quot;Gershwin plays Gershwin, Historic First Recordings&quot; (RCA Victrola AVM1-1740). Included was the first LP release of the 1924 recording of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra and Gershwin on piano; &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, from 1929 conducted by Nathaniel Shilkret with Gershwin on celesta. Also included were &quot;Three Preludes&quot;, &quot;Clap Yo&#x27; Hands&quot; and &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot;, among others.

The soundtrack to Woody Allen&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Manhattan&quot; is composed entirely of Gershwin&#x27;s compositions, including &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, &quot;Love is Sweeping the Country&quot;, and &quot;But Not for Me&quot;, performed by both the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta and the Buffalo Philharmonic under Michael Tilson Thomas. The film begins with a monolog by Allen, in the role of a writer, describing a character in his book: &quot;He adored New York City ... To him, no matter what the season was, this was still a town that existed in black and white and pulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin.&quot; In 1993, two audio CDs featuring piano rolls recorded by Gershwin were issued by Nonesuch Records through the efforts of Artis Wodehouse, entitled &quot;Gershwin Plays Gershwin: The Piano Rolls&quot;. In 2010, Brian Wilson released &quot;Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin&quot;, consisting of ten George and Ira Gershwin songs, bookended by passages from &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, with two new songs completed from unfinished Gershwin fragments by Wilson and band member Scott Bennett.

==Legacy==
===Estate===
Gershwin died intestate, and his estate passed to his mother. The estate continues to collect royalties in the United States from licensing the copyrights on his post-&quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; work. The estate supported the Sonny Bono Copyright Term extension Act (that extended the U.S. 75-year copyright protection an additional 20 years) because its 1923 cutoff date was shortly before Gershwin had begun to create his most popular works. The copyrights on all Gershwin&#x27;s solo works expired at the end of 2007 in the European Union, based on its life-plus-70-years rule, and in the U.S. on January 1, 2020, on Gershwin&#x27;s pre-1925 work.

In 2005, &quot;The Guardian&quot; determined using &quot;estimates of earnings accrued in a composer&#x27;s lifetime&quot; that George Gershwin was the wealthiest composer of all time.

The George and Ira Gershwin Collection, much of which was donated by Ira and the Gershwin family estates, resides at the Library of Congress.

In September 2013, a partnership between the estates of Ira and George Gershwin and the University of Michigan was created and will provide the university&#x27;s School of Music, Theatre, and Dance access to Gershwin&#x27;s entire body of work, which includes all of Gershwin&#x27;s papers, compositional drafts, and scores. This direct access to all of his works provides opportunities to musicians, composers, and scholars to analyze and reinterpret his work with the goal of accurately reflecting the composers&#x27; vision to preserve his legacy. The first fascicles of &quot;The Gershwin Critical Edition&quot;, edited by Mark Clague, are expected in 2017; they will cover the 1924 jazz band version of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, &quot;An American in Paris&quot; and &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

===Awards and honors===
* In 1937, Gershwin received his sole Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song at the 1937 Oscars for &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me&quot;, written with his brother Ira for the 1937 film &quot;Shall We Dance&quot;. The nomination was posthumous; Gershwin died two months after the film&#x27;s release.
* In 1982, George Gershwin was inducted into the Jewish-American Hall of Fame.
* In 1985, the Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to George and Ira Gershwin. Only three other songwriters, George M. Cohan, Harry Chapin, and Irving Berlin, have received this award.
* In 1998 a special Pulitzer Prize was posthumously awarded to Gershwin &quot;commemorating the centennial year of his birth, for his distinguished and enduring contributions to American music.&quot;
* The George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Musical Achievement Award was established by UCLA to honor the brothers for their contribution to music and for their gift to UCLA of the fight song &quot;Strike Up the Band for UCLA&quot;.
* In 2006, Gershwin was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame.
* In 2007, the Library of Congress created the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song (aka, Gershwin Prize) in honor of both George and Ira Gershwin.

===Namesakes===
* The Gershwin Theatre on Broadway is named after George and Ira.
* The Gershwin Hotel in the Flatiron District of Manhattan in New York City was named after George and Ira.
* In Brooklyn, George Gershwin Junior High School 166 is named after him.
* One of Holland America Line&#x27;s ships, MS &quot;Koningsdam&quot;, has a Gershwin Deck (Deck 5)

===Biopic===
* The 1945 biographical film &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; starred Robert Alda as George Gershwin.

===Portrayals in other media===
* In George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones&quot; a fictional George Gershwin appears as a friend of Indiana Jones in the made-for-TV movie from 1999, &quot;Scandal of 1920.&quot; He also briefly appears in &quot;Hollywood Follies&quot;. He is portrayed by Tom Beckett.
* Since 1999, Hershey Felder has produced a one-man show with him portraying &quot;George Gershwin Alone&quot;, which has played over 3,000 performances and won two 2007 Ovation Awards. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Felder launched a global live-streaming &quot;Hershey Felder Presents: Live from Florence&quot; featuring a performance of &quot;Hershey Felder as &quot;George Gershwin Alone&quot;&quot; in September 2020.
* Paul Rudd portrays an imaginary friend based on George Gershwin, said to be his creator&#x27;s favorite composer, in the 2015 series finale of the Irish sitcom &quot;Moone Boy&quot;, &quot;Gershwin&#x27;s Bucket List&quot;.

<text>In linguistics, a grammatical gender system is a specific form of a noun class system, where nouns are assigned to gender categories that are often not related to the real-world qualities of the entities denoted by those nouns. In languages with grammatical gender, most or all nouns inherently carry one value of the grammatical category called &quot;gender&quot;. The values present in a given language, of which there are usually two or three, are called the &quot;genders&quot; of that language.

Whereas some authors use the term &quot;grammatical gender&quot; as a synonym of &quot;noun class&quot;, others use different definitions for each. Many authors prefer &quot;noun classes&quot; when none of the inflections in a language relate to sex or gender. According to one estimate, gender is used in approximately half of the world&#x27;s languages. According to one definition: &quot;Genders are classes of nouns reflected in the behavior of associated words.&quot;

== Overview ==
Languages with grammatical gender usually have two to four different genders, but some are attested with up to 20.

Common gender divisions include masculine and feminine; masculine, feminine, and neuter; or animate and inanimate.

Depending on the language and the word, this assignment might bear some relationship with the meaning of the noun (e.g. &quot;woman&quot; is usually feminine), or may be arbitrary.

In a few languages, the assignment of any particular noun (i.e., nominal lexeme, that set of noun forms inflectable from a common lemma) to one grammatical gender is solely determined by that noun&#x27;s meaning, or attributes, like biological sex, humanness, or animacy. However, the existence of words that denote male and female, such as the difference between &quot;aunt&quot; and &quot;uncle&quot; is not enough to constitute a gender system.

In other languages, the division into genders usually correlates to some degree, at least for a certain set of nouns, such as those denoting humans, with some property or properties of the things that particular nouns denote. Such properties include animacy or inanimacy, &quot;humanness&quot; or non-humanness, and biological sex.

However, in most languages, this semantic division is only partially valid, and many nouns may belong to a gender category that contrasts with their meaning, e.g. the word for &quot;manliness&quot; could be of feminine gender, as it is in French with &quot;la masculinité&quot; and &quot;la virilité&quot;. In such a case, the gender assignment can also be influenced by the morphology or phonology of the noun, or in some cases can be apparently arbitrary.

Usually each noun is assigned to one of the genders, and few or no nouns can occur in more than one gender.

Gender is considered an inherent quality of nouns, and it affects the forms of other related words, a process called &quot;agreement&quot;. Nouns may be considered the &quot;triggers&quot; of the process, whereas other words will be the &quot;target&quot; of these changes.

These related words can be, depending on the language: determiners, pronouns, numerals, quantifiers, possessives, adjectives, past and passive participles, articles, verbs, adverbs, complementizers, and adpositions. Gender class may be marked on the noun itself, but will also always be marked on other constituents in a noun phrase or sentence. If the noun is explicitly marked, both trigger and target may feature similar alternations.

=== Functions ===
Three possible functions of grammatical gender include:
# In a language with explicit inflections for gender, it is easy to express gender distinctions in animate beings.
# Grammatical gender &quot;can be a valuable tool of disambiguation&quot;, rendering clarity about antecedents or homophones.
# In literature, gender can be used to &quot;animate and personify inanimate nouns&quot;. Languages with gender distinction generally have fewer cases of ambiguity concerning, for example, pronominal reference. In the English phrase &quot;a flowerbed in the garden which I maintain&quot;, only context tells us whether the relative clause (&quot;which I maintain&quot;) refers to the whole garden or just the flowerbed. In German, in cases where the objects in question have different grammatical gender, gender distinction prevents such ambiguity. The word for &quot;flowerbed&quot; () is neuter, whereas that for &quot;garden&quot; () is masculine. Hence, if a neuter relative pronoun is used, the relative clause refers to &quot;flowerbed&quot;, and if a masculine pronoun is used, the relative clause refers to &quot;garden&quot;. Because of this, languages with gender distinction can often use pronouns where in English a noun would have to be repeated in order to avoid confusion. It does not, however, help in cases where the words are of the same grammatical gender.

Moreover, grammatical gender may serve to distinguish homophones. It is a quite common phenomenon in language development for two phonemes to merge, thereby making etymologically distinct words sound alike. In languages with gender distinction, however, these word pairs may still be distinguishable by their gender. For example, French (&quot;pot&quot;) and (&quot;skin&quot;) are homophones , but disagree in gender: vs. .

=== Gender contrasts ===

Common systems of gender contrast include:
* masculine–feminine gender contrast
* masculine–feminine–neuter gender contrast
* animate–inanimate gender contrast
* common–neuter gender contrast

==== Masculine–feminine contrast ====
Nouns that denote specifically male persons (or animals) are normally of masculine gender; those that denote specifically female persons (or animals) are normally of feminine gender; and nouns that denote something that does not have any sex, or do not specify the sex of their referent, have come to belong to one or other of the genders, in a way that may appear arbitrary. Examples of languages with such a system include most of the modern Romance languages, the Baltic languages, the Celtic languages, some Indo-Aryan languages (e.g., Hindustani), and the Afroasiatic languages.

==== Masculine–feminine–neuter contrast ====
This is similar to systems with a masculine–feminine contrast, except that there is a third available gender, so nouns with sexless or unspecified-sex referents may be either masculine, feminine, or neuter. There are also certain exceptional nouns whose gender does not follow the denoted sex, such as the German , meaning &quot;girl&quot;, which is neuter. This is because it is actually a diminutive of &quot;Magd&quot; and all diminutive forms with the suffix are neuter. Examples of languages with such a system include later forms of Proto-Indo-European (see below), Sanskrit, some Germanic languages, most Slavic languages, a few Romance languages (Romanian, Asturian and Neapolitan), Marathi, Latin, and Greek.

==== Animate–inanimate contrast ====
Here nouns that denote animate things (humans and animals) generally belong to one gender, and those that denote inanimate things to another (although there may be some deviation from that principle). Examples include earlier forms of Proto-Indo-European and the earliest family known to have split off from it, the extinct Anatolian languages (see below). Modern examples include Algonquian languages such as Ojibwe.
* In Northern Kurdish language (Kurmanji), the same word can have two genders according to the context. For example, if the word (meaning &#x27;wood&#x27; or &#x27;tree&#x27;) is feminine, it means that it is a living tree (e.g., means &#x27;apple tree&#x27;), but if it is masculine, it means that it is dead, no longer living (e.g., means &#x27;apple wood&#x27;). So if one wants to refer to a certain table that is made of wood from an apple tree, one cannot use the word with a feminine gender, and if one wants to refer to an apple tree in a garden, one cannot use with a masculine gender.

==== Common–neuter contrast ====
Here a masculine–feminine–neuter system previously existed, but the distinction between masculine and feminine genders has been lost in nouns (they have merged into what is called &quot;common gender&quot;), though not in pronouns that can operate under natural gender. Thus nouns denoting people are usually of common gender, whereas other nouns may be of either gender. Examples include Danish and Swedish (see Gender in Danish and Swedish), and to some extent Dutch (see Gender in Dutch grammar). 

The dialect of the old Norwegian capital Bergen also uses common gender and neuter exclusively. The common gender in Bergen and in Danish is inflected with the same articles and suffixes as the masculine gender in Norwegian Bokmål. This makes some obviously feminine noun phrases like &quot;a cute girl&quot;, &quot;the well milking cow&quot; or &quot;the pregnant mares&quot; sound strange to most Norwegian ears when spoken by Danes and people from Bergen since they are inflected in a way that sounds like the masculine declensions in South-Eastern Norwegian dialects. 

The same does not apply to Swedish common gender, as the declensions follow a different pattern from both the Norwegian written languages. Norwegian Nynorsk, Norwegian Bokmål and most spoken dialects retain masculine, feminine and neuter even if their Scandinavian neighbors have lost one of the genders. As shown, the merger of masculine and feminine in these languages and dialects can be considered a reversal of the original split in Proto-Indo-European (see below).

==== Other types of division or subdivision of gender ====
Some gender contrasts are referred to as &quot;classes&quot;; for some examples, see Noun class. In some of the Slavic languages, for example, within the masculine and sometimes feminine and neuter genders, there is a further division between animate and inanimate nouns—and in Polish, also sometimes between nouns denoting humans and non-humans. (For details, see below.) A human–non-human (or &quot;rational–non-rational&quot;) distinction is also found in Dravidian languages. (See below.)

=== How gender contrasts can influence cognition ===

It has been shown that grammatical gender causes a number of cognitive effects. For example, when native speakers of gendered languages are asked to imagine an inanimate object speaking, whether its voice is male or female tends to correspond to the grammatical gender of the object in their language. This has been observed for speakers of Spanish, French, and German, among others.

Caveats of this research include the possibility of subjects&#x27; &quot;using grammatical gender as a strategy for performing the task&quot;, and the fact that even for inanimate objects the gender of nouns is not always random. For example, in Spanish, female gender is often attributed to objects that are &quot;used by women, natural, round, or light&quot; and male gender to objects &quot;used by men, artificial, angular, or heavy.&quot; Apparent failures to reproduce the effect for German speakers has also led to a proposal that the effect is restricted to languages with a two-gender system, possibly because such languages are inclined towards a greater correspondence between grammatical and natural gender.

Another kind of test asks people to describe a noun, and attempts to measure whether it takes on gender-specific connotations depending on the speaker&#x27;s native language. For example, one study found that German speakers describing a bridge (, ) more often used the words &#x27;beautiful&#x27;, &#x27;elegant&#x27;, &#x27;pretty&#x27;, and &#x27;slender&#x27;, while Spanish speakers, whose word for bridge is masculine (, ), used &#x27;big&#x27;, &#x27;dangerous&#x27;, &#x27;strong&#x27;, and &#x27;sturdy&#x27; more often. However, studies of this kind have been criticized on various grounds and yield an unclear pattern of results overall.

=== Related linguistic concepts ===
==== Noun classes ====

A noun may belong to a given class because of characteristic features of its referent, such as sex, animacy, shape, although in some instances a noun can be placed in a particular class based purely on its grammatical behavior. Some authors use the term &quot;grammatical gender&quot; as a synonym of &quot;noun class&quot;, but others use different definitions for each.

Many authors prefer &quot;noun classes&quot; when none of the inflections in a language relate to sex, such as when an animate–inanimate distinction is made. Note, however, that the word &quot;gender&quot; derives from Latin (also the root of &quot;genre&quot;) which originally meant &quot;kind&quot;, so it does not necessarily have a sexual meaning.

==== Noun classifiers ====

A classifier, or measure word, is a word or morpheme used in some languages together with a noun, principally to enable numbers and certain other determiners to be applied to the noun. They are not regularly used in English or other European languages, although they parallel the use of words such as &quot;piece(s)&quot; and &quot;head&quot; in phrases like &quot;three pieces of paper&quot; or &quot;thirty head of cattle&quot;. They are a prominent feature of East Asian languages, where it is common for all nouns to require a classifier when being quantified—for example, the equivalent of &quot;three people&quot; is often &quot;three &quot;classifier&quot; people&quot;. A more general type of classifier (classifier handshapes) can be found in sign languages.

Classifiers can be considered similar to genders or noun classes, in that a language which uses classifiers normally has a number of different ones, used with different sets of nouns. These sets depend largely on properties of the things that the nouns denote (for example, a particular classifier may be used for long thin objects, another for flat objects, another for people, another for abstracts, etc.), although sometimes a noun is associated with a particular classifier more by convention than for any obvious reason. However it is also possible for a given noun to be usable with any of several classifiers; for example, the Mandarin Chinese classifier () is frequently used as an alternative to various more specific classifiers.

== Manifestation ==
Grammatical gender can be realized as inflection and can be conditioned by other types of inflection, especially number inflection, where the singular-plural contrast can interact with gender inflection.

=== As inflection ===
The grammatical gender of a noun manifests itself in two principal ways: in the modifications that the noun itself undergoes, and in modifications of other related words (agreement).

==== As noun inflection ====
Grammatical gender manifests itself when words related to a noun like determiners, pronouns or adjectives change their form (&quot;inflect&quot;) according to the gender of noun they refer to (&quot;agreement&quot;). The parts of speech affected by gender agreement, the circumstances in which it occurs, and the way words are marked for gender vary between languages. Gender inflection may interact with other grammatical categories like number or case. In some languages the declension pattern followed by the noun itself will be different for different genders.

The gender of a noun may affect the modifications that the noun itself undergoes, particularly the way in which the noun inflects for number and case. For example, a language like Latin, German or Russian has a number of different declension patterns, and which pattern a particular noun follows may be highly correlated with its gender. For some instances of this, see Latin declension. A concrete example is provided by the German word , which has two possible genders: when it is masculine (meaning &quot;lake&quot;) its genitive singular form is , but when it is feminine (meaning &quot;sea&quot;), the genitive is , because feminine nouns do not take the genitive &quot;-s&quot;.

Gender is sometimes reflected in other ways. In Welsh, gender marking is mostly lost on nouns; however, Welsh has initial mutation, where the first consonant of a word changes into another in certain conditions. Gender is one of the factors that can cause one form of mutation (soft mutation). For instance, the word &quot;girl&quot; changes into &quot;ferch&quot; after the definite article. This only occurs with feminine singular nouns: &quot;son&quot; remains unchanged. Adjectives are affected by gender in a similar way.

Additionally, in many languages, gender is often closely correlated with the basic unmodified form (lemma) of the noun, and sometimes a noun can be modified to produce (for example) masculine and feminine words of similar meaning. See , below.

==== As agreement or concord ====
Agreement, or concord, is a grammatical process in which certain words change their form so that values of certain grammatical categories match those of related words. Gender is one of the categories which frequently require agreement. In this case, nouns may be considered the &quot;triggers&quot; of the process, because they have an inherent gender, whereas related words that change their form to match the gender of the noun can be considered the &quot;target&quot; of these changes.

These related words can be, depending on the language: determiners, pronouns, numerals, quantifiers, possessives, adjectives, past and passive participles, verbs, adverbs, complementizers, and adpositions. Gender class may be marked on the noun itself, but can also be marked on other constituents in a noun phrase or sentence. If the noun is explicitly marked, both trigger and target may feature similar alternations.

As an example, we consider Spanish, a language with two gender categories: &quot;natural&quot; vs &quot;grammatical&quot;. &quot;Natural&quot; gender can be masculine or feminine, while &quot;grammatical&quot; gender can be masculine, feminine, or neuter. This third, or &quot;neuter&quot; gender is reserved for abstract concepts derived from adjectives: such as , (&quot;that which is good/bad&quot;). Natural gender refers to the biological sex of most animals and people, while grammatical gender refers to certain phonetic characteristics (the sounds at the end, or beginning) of a noun. Among other lexical items, the definite article changes its form according to this categorization. In the singular, the article is: (masculine), and (feminine). Thus, in &quot;natural gender&quot;, nouns referring to sexed beings who are male beings carry the masculine article, and female beings the feminine article (agreement).

==== Gender inflection and number inflection ====
In some languages the gender is distinguished only in singular number but not in plural. In terms of linguistic markedness, these languages neutralize the gender opposition in the plural, itself a marked category. So adjectives and pronouns have three forms in singular ( Bulgarian , , or German , , ) but only one in plural (Bulgarian , German ) [all examples mean &quot;red&quot;]. As a consequence &quot;pluralia tantum&quot; nouns (lacking a singular form) cannot be assigned a gender. Example with Bulgarian: (, &quot;pincers&quot;), (, &quot;pants&quot;), (, &quot;spectacles&quot;), (, &quot;gills&quot;). 

Other languages, Serbo-Croatian, allow doubly marked forms both for number and gender. In these languages, each noun has a definite gender no matter the number. For example, &quot;children&quot; is feminine &quot;singularia tantum&quot; and &quot;door&quot; is neuter &quot;pluralia tantum&quot;.

=== On pronouns ===
Pronouns may agree in gender with the noun or noun phrase to which they refer (their antecedent). Sometimes, however, there is no antecedent—the referent of the pronoun is deduced indirectly from the context: this is found with personal pronouns, as well as with indefinite and dummy pronouns.

==== Personal pronouns ====
With personal pronouns, the gender of the pronoun is likely to agree with the &quot;natural gender&quot; of the referent. Indeed, in most European languages, personal pronouns are gendered; for example English (the personal pronouns &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot; and &quot;it&quot; are used depending on whether the referent is male, female, or inanimate or non-human; this is in spite of the fact that English does not generally have grammatical gender). A parallel example is provided by the object suffixes of verbs in Arabic, which correspond to object pronouns, and which also inflect for gender in the second person (though not in the first):
* &quot;I love you&quot;, said to a male: &quot;&quot; ()
* &quot;I love you&quot;, said to a female: &quot;&quot; ()

Not all languages have gendered pronouns. In languages that never had grammatical gender, there is normally just one word for &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot;, like in Malay and Indonesian, in Hungarian and in Turkish. These languages might only have different pronouns and inflections in the third person to differentiate between people and inanimate objects, but even this distinction is often absent. (In written Finnish, for example, is used for &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; and for &quot;it&quot;, but in the colloquial language is usually used for &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; as well.)

For more on these different types of pronoun, see Third-person pronoun. Issues may arise in languages with gender-specific pronouns in cases when the gender of the referent is unknown or not specified; this is discussed under Gender-neutral language, and in relation to English at Singular &quot;they&quot;.

In some cases the gender of a pronoun is not marked in the form of the pronoun itself, but is marked on other words by way of agreement. Thus the French word for &quot;I&quot; is , regardless of who is speaking; but this word becomes feminine or masculine depending on the sex of the speaker, as may be reflected through adjective agreement: (&quot;I am strong&quot;, spoken by a female); (the same spoken by a male).

In null-subject languages (and in some elliptical expressions in other languages), such agreement may take place even though the pronoun does not in fact appear. For example, in Portuguese:
* &quot;[I am] very grateful&quot;, said by a male: 
* the same, said by a female: 
The two sentences above mean literally &quot;much obliged&quot;; the adjective agrees with the natural gender of the speaker, that is, with the gender of the first person pronoun which does not appear explicitly here.

==== Indefinite and dummy pronouns ====
A dummy pronoun is a type of pronoun used when a particular verb argument (such as the subject) is nonexistent, but when a reference to the argument is nevertheless syntactically required. They occur mostly in non-pro-drop languages, such as English (because in pro-drop languages the position of the argument can be left empty). Examples in English are the uses of &quot;it&quot; in &quot;It&#x27;s raining&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s nice to relax.&quot;

When a language has gendered pronouns, the use of a particular word as a dummy pronoun may involve the selection of a particular gender, even though there is no noun to agree with. In languages with a neuter gender, a neuter pronoun is usually used, as in German (&quot;it rains, it&#x27;s raining&quot;), where is the neuter third person singular pronoun. (English behaves similarly, because the word &quot;it&quot; comes from the Old English neuter gender.) In languages with only masculine and feminine genders, the dummy pronoun may be the masculine third person singular, as in the French for &quot;it&#x27;s raining&quot;: (where means &quot;he&quot;, or &quot;it&quot; when referring to masculine nouns); although some languages use the feminine, as in the equivalent Welsh sentence: (where the dummy pronoun is , which means &quot;she&quot;, or &quot;it&quot; when referring to feminine nouns).

A similar, apparently arbitrary gender assignment may need to be made in the case of indefinite pronouns, where the referent is generally unknown. In this case the question is usually not which pronoun to use, but which gender to assign a given pronoun to (for such purposes as adjective agreement). For example, the French pronouns (&quot;someone&quot;), (&quot;no-one&quot;) and (&quot;something&quot;) are all treated as masculine—this is in spite of the fact that the last two correspond to feminine nouns ( meaning &quot;person&quot;, and meaning &quot;thing&quot;).

For other situations in which such a &quot;default&quot; gender assignment may be required, see below.

=== Grammatical vs. natural gender ===
The &quot;natural gender&quot; of a noun, pronoun or noun phrase is a gender to which it would be expected to belong based on relevant attributes of its referent. Although grammatical gender can coincide with natural gender, it does not need to.

==== Grammatical gender can match natural gender ====
This usually means masculine or feminine, depending on the referent&#x27;s sex. For example, in Spanish, (&quot;woman&quot;) is feminine whereas (&quot;man&quot;) is masculine; these attributions occur solely due to the semantically inherent gender character of each noun.

==== Grammatical gender need not match natural gender ====

The &quot;grammatical gender&quot; of a noun does not always coincide with its natural gender. An example of this is the German word (&quot;girl&quot;); this is derived from (&quot;maiden&quot;), umlauted to with the diminutive suffix , and this suffix always makes the noun grammatically neuter. Hence the grammatical gender of is neuter, although its natural gender is feminine (because it refers to a female person).

Other examples include:
* Old English (neuter) and (masculine), meaning &quot;woman&quot;
* German (neuter), meaning &quot;woman&quot; (the word is now pejorative and generally replaced with , originally &#x27;lady&#x27;, feminine of obsolete , meaning &#x27;lord&#x27;)
* Irish (masculine) meaning &quot;girl&quot;, and (feminine) meaning &quot;stallion&quot;
* Portuguese (masculine), meaning &quot;voluptuous woman&quot;
* Scottish Gaelic (masculine), meaning &quot;woman&quot;
* Slovenian (neuter), meaning &quot;girl&quot;
* Polish (masculine), meaning &quot;unpleasant (usually old and ugly) woman&quot;
*Czech (neuter), meaning &quot;a young girl&quot;
Normally, such exceptions are a small minority.

When a noun with conflicting natural and grammatical gender is the antecedent of a pronoun, it may not be clear which gender of pronoun to choose. There is a certain tendency to keep the grammatical gender when a close back-reference is made, but to switch to natural gender when the reference is further away. For example, in German, the sentences &quot;The girl has come home from school. She is now doing her homework&quot; can be translated in two ways:
* 
Though the second sentence may appear grammatically incorrect (constructio ad sensum), it is common in speech. With one or more intervening sentences, the second form becomes even more likely. However, a switch to the natural gender is never possible with articles and &quot;attributive&quot; pronouns or adjectives. Thus it can never be correct to say (&quot;a girl&quot; – with female indefinite article) or (&quot;this little girl&quot; – with female demonstrative pronoun and adjective).

This phenomenon is quite popular in Slavic languages: for example Polish (deprecative &quot;creature&quot;) is feminine but can be used to refer to both man (masculine gender), woman (feminine gender), child (neuter gender) or even animate nouns (e.g. a dog being masculine). Similarly with other deprecatory nouns as , , , , (&quot;wuss, klutz&quot;); (&quot;mute&quot;) can be used deprecatively as described previously, and then can be used for verbs marked for the male and female genders.

==== Gender contrasts on human versus sentient referents ====
In the case of languages which have masculine and feminine genders, the relation between biological sex and grammatical gender tends to be less exact in the case of animals than in the case of people. In Spanish, for instance, a cheetah is always (masculine) and a zebra is always (feminine), regardless of their biological sex. In Russian a rat and a butterfly are always () and () (feminine). In French, a giraffe is always , whereas an elephant is always . To specify the sex of an animal, an adjective may be added, as in (&quot;a female cheetah&quot;), or (&quot;a male zebra&quot;). Different names for the male and the female of a species are more frequent for common pets or farm animals, English &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;bull&quot;, Spanish &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;bull&quot;, Russian &#x27; () &quot;ram&quot; and &#x27; () &quot;ewe&quot;.

As regards the pronouns used to refer to animals, these generally agree in gender with the nouns denoting those animals, rather than the animals&#x27; sex (natural gender). In a language like English, which does not assign grammatical gender to nouns, the pronoun used for referring to objects (&quot;it&quot;) is often used for animals also. However, if the sex of the animal is known, and particularly in the case of companion animals, the gendered pronouns (&quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot;) may be used as they would be for a human.

In Polish, a few general words such as (&quot;animal&quot;) or (&quot;animal, one head of cattle&quot;) are neuter, but most species names are masculine or feminine. When the sex of an animal is known, it will normally be referred to using gendered pronouns consistent with its sex; otherwise the pronouns will correspond to the gender of the noun denoting its species.

=== Syntactic structure ===
There are multiple theoretical approaches to the position and structure of gender in syntactic structures.

== Categorization of nouns into genders ==

There are three main ways by which natural languages categorize nouns into genders:
* according to their form (morphological)
* according to logical or symbolic similarities in their meaning (semantic)
* according to arbitrary convention (lexical, possibly rooted in the language&#x27;s history).

In most languages that have grammatical gender, a combination of these three types of criteria is found, although one type may be more prevalent.

=== Form-based morphological criteria ===
In many languages, nouns are assigned to gender largely without any semantic basis—that is, not based on any feature (such as animacy or sex) of the person or thing that a noun represents. In such languages there may be a correlation, to a greater or lesser degree, between gender and the form of a noun (such as the vowel or consonant or syllable with which it ends).

For example, in Portuguese and Spanish, nouns that end in are mostly masculine, whereas those that end in are mostly feminine, regardless of their meaning. Nouns that end in some other vowel or a consonant are assigned a gender either according to etymology, by analogy, or by some other convention. These rules may override semantics in some cases: for example, the noun / (&quot;member&quot;) is always masculine, even when it refers to a girl or a woman, and / (&quot;person&quot;) is always feminine, even when it refers to a boy or a man, a kind of form-meaning mismatch. 

In other cases, meaning takes precedence: the noun &quot;communist&quot; is masculine when it refers or could refer to a man, even though it ends with . Nouns in Spanish and Portuguese, as in the other Romance languages such as Italian and French, generally follow the gender of the Latin words from which they are derived. When nouns deviate from the rules for gender, there is usually an etymological explanation: (&quot;problem&quot;) is masculine in Spanish because it was derived from a Greek noun of the neuter gender, whereas (&quot;photo&quot;) and (&quot;broadcast signal&quot;) are feminine because they are clippings of and respectively, both grammatically feminine nouns. 

Most Spanish nouns in are feminine. They derive from Latin feminines in , accusative . The opposite is correct with Northern Kurdish language or Kurmanci. For example, the words (member) and (friend) can be masculine or feminine according to the person they refer to.
* (His daughter is my friend)
* (His son is my friend)

Suffixes often carry a specific gender. For example, in German, diminutives with the suffixes and (meaning &quot;little, young&quot;) are always neuter, even if they refer to people, as with (&quot;girl&quot;) and (&quot;young woman&quot;) (see below). Similarly, the suffix , which makes countable nouns from uncountable nouns ( &quot;dough&quot; → &quot;piece of dough&quot;), or personal nouns from abstract nouns ( &quot;teaching&quot;, &quot;punishment&quot; → &quot;apprentice&quot;, &quot;convict&quot;) or adjectives ( &quot;cowardly&quot; → &quot;coward&quot;), always produces masculine nouns. And the German suffixes and (comparable with &quot;-hood&quot; and &quot;-ness&quot; in English) produce feminine nouns.

In Irish, nouns ending in / and are always masculine, whereas those ending or are always feminine.

In Arabic, nouns whose singular form ends in a &quot;tāʾ marbūṭah&quot; (traditionally a , becoming in pausa) are of feminine gender, the only significant exceptions being the word (&quot;caliph&quot;) and certain masculine personal names ( ʾUsāmah). However, many masculine nouns have a &quot;broken&quot; plural form ending in a &quot;tāʾ marbūṭa&quot;; for example &quot;&quot; (&quot;male professor&quot;) has the plural , which might be confused for a feminine singular noun. Gender may also be predictable from the type of derivation: for instance, the verbal nouns of Stem II (e.g. , from ) are always masculine.

In French, nouns ending in tend to be feminine, whereas others tend to be masculine, but there are many exceptions to this ( , , , , are masculine as , , , , are feminine), note the many masculine nouns ending in preceded by double consonants. Certain suffixes are quite reliable indicators, such as , which when added to a verb ( &quot;to park&quot; → ; nettoyer &quot;to clean&quot; → &quot;cleaning&quot;) indicates a masculine noun; however, when is part of the root of the word, it can be feminine, as in (&quot;beach&quot;) or . On the other hand, nouns ending in , and are almost all feminine, with a few exceptions, such as , .

Nouns can sometimes vary their form to enable the derivation of differently gendered cognate nouns; for example, to produce nouns with a similar meaning but referring to someone of a different sex. Thus, in Spanish, means &quot;boy&quot;, and means &quot;girl&quot;. This paradigm can be exploited for making new words: from the masculine nouns &quot;lawyer&quot;, &quot;member of parliament&quot; and &quot;doctor&quot;, it was straightforward to make the feminine equivalents , , and .

In the same way, personal names are frequently constructed with affixes that identify the sex of the bearer. Common feminine suffixes used in English names are &quot;-a&quot;, of Latin or Romance origin ( &quot;Robert&quot; and &quot;Roberta&quot;); and &quot;-e&quot;, of French origin (cf. &quot;Justin&quot; and &quot;Justine&quot;).

Although gender inflection may be used to construct nouns and names for people of different sexes in languages that have grammatical gender, this alone does not constitute grammatical gender. Distinct words and names for men and women are also common in languages which do not have a grammatical gender system for nouns in general. English, for example, has feminine suffixes such as &quot;-ess&quot; (as in &quot;waitress&quot;), and also distinguishes male and female personal names, as in the above examples.

==== Differentiation of personal names ====
Given names are proper nouns and they follow the same gender grammatical rules as common nouns. In most Indo-European languages female grammatical gender is created using an &quot;a&quot; or an &quot;e&quot; ending.

Classical Latin typically made a grammatical feminine gender with ( &quot;forest&quot;, &quot;water&quot;) and this was reflected in feminine names originating in that period, like Emilia. Romance languages preserved this characteristic. For example, in Spanish, approximately 89% of nouns that end in &quot;-a&quot; or -&quot;á&quot; are classified as feminine; the same is true for 98% of given names with the &quot;-a&quot; ending.

In the Germanic languages the female names have been Latinized by adding &quot;-e&quot; and &quot;-a&quot;: Brunhild, Kriemhild and Hroswith became Brunhilde, Kriemhilde and Hroswitha.
Slavic feminine given names: Olga (Russian), Małgorzata (Polish), Tetiana (Ukrainian), Oksana (Belarusian), Eliška (Czech), Bronislava (Slovak), Milica (Serbian), Darina (Bulgarian), Lucja (Croatian), Lamija (Bosnian) and Zala (Slovenian).

==== Differentiation of nouns with human referents ====
In some languages, nouns with human references have two forms, a male and a female one. This includes not only proper names, but also names for occupations and nationalities. Examples include:

* English proper names:
*# male: &quot;Andrew&quot;
*# female: &quot;Andrea&quot;
*# common: &quot;Chris&quot; for both male and female
* English occupation names
*# male: &quot;waiter&quot;
*# female: &quot;waitress&quot;
*# common: &quot;doctor&quot; for both male and female
* Greek proper names () and ()
* Greek occupation names () &quot;actor&quot; for both male and female in Greek and () &quot;doctor&quot; for both, but with informal female variants () and ()
* Greek nationality names have five possibilities for &#x27;English&#x27;.
*# male: ()
*# female: ()
*# masculine: ()
*# feminine: ()
*# neuter: ()

To complicate matters, Greek often offers additional informal versions of these. The corresponding for English are the following: (), (), (), (), (). The formal forms come from the name () &quot;England&quot;, while the less formal are derived from Italian .

===Meaning-based semantic criteria===
In some languages, gender is determined by strictly semantic criteria, but in other languages, semantic criteria only partially determine gender.

====Strict semantic criteria====

In some languages, the gender of a noun is directly determined by its physical attributes (sex, animacy, etc.), and there are few or no exceptions to this rule. There are relatively few such languages. The Dravidian languages use this system as described below.

Another example is the Dizi language, which has two asymmetrical genders. The feminine includes all living beings of female sex (e.g. woman, girl, cow...) and diminutives; the masculine encompasses all other nouns (e.g. man, boy, pot, broom...). In this language, feminine nouns are always marked with &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-in&quot;.

Another African language, Defaka, has three genders: one for all male humans, one for all female humans, and a third for all the remaining nouns. Gender is only marked in personal pronouns. Standard English pronouns (see below) are very similar in this respect, although the English gendered pronouns (&quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;) are used for domestic animals if the sex of the animal is known, and sometimes for certain objects such as ships, e.g. &quot;What happened to the Titanic? She (or it) sank.&quot;

==== Mostly semantic criteria ====
In some languages, the gender of nouns can mostly be determined by physical (semantic) attributes, although there remain some nouns whose gender is not assigned in this way (Corbett calls this &quot;semantic residue&quot;). The world view (e.g. mythology) of the speakers may influence the division of categories.

* Zande has four genders: male human, female human, animal, and inanimate. However, there are about 80 nouns representing inanimate entities which are nonetheless animate in gender: heavenly objects (moon, rainbow), metal objects (hammer, ring), edible plants (sweet potato, pea), and non-metallic objects (whistle, ball). Many have a round shape or can be explained by the role they play in mythology.
* Ket has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and most gender assignment is based on semantics, but there are many inanimate nouns outside the neuter class. Masculine nouns include male animates, most fish, trees, the moon, large wooden objects, most living beings and some religious items. Feminine nouns include female animates, three types of fish, some plants, the sun and other heavenly objects, some body parts and skin diseases, the soul, and some religious items. Words for part of a whole, as well as most other nouns that do not fall into any of the aforementioned classes, are neuter. The gender assignment of non-sex-differentiable things is complex. In general, those of no importance to the Kets are feminine, whereas objects of importance (e.g. fish, wood) are masculine. Mythology is again a significant factor.
* Alamblak has two genders, masculine and feminine. However, the masculine also includes things which are tall or long and slender, or narrow (e.g. fish, snakes, arrows and slender trees), whereas the feminine gender has things which are short, squat or wide (e.g. turtles, houses, shields and squat trees).
* In French, the distinction between the gender of a noun and the gender of the object it refers to is clear when nouns of different genders can be used for the same object, for example vélo (m.) = bicyclette (f.).

==== Contextual determination of gender ====
There are certain situations where the assignment of gender to a noun, pronoun or noun phrase may not be straightforward. This includes in particular:
* groups of mixed gender;
* references to people or things of unknown or unspecified gender.

In languages with masculine and feminine gender, the masculine is usually employed by default to refer to persons of unknown gender and to groups of people of mixed gender. Thus, in French the feminine plural pronoun always designates an all-female group of people (or stands for a group of nouns all of feminine gender), but the masculine equivalent may refer to a group of males or masculine nouns, to a mixed group, or to a group of people of unknown genders. In such cases, one says that the feminine gender is semantically marked, whereas the masculine gender is unmarked.

In English, the problem of gender determination does not arise in the plural, because gender in that language is reflected only in pronouns, and the plural pronoun &quot;they&quot; does not have gendered forms. In the singular, however, the issue frequently arises when a person of unspecified or unknown gender is being referred to. In this case it the Singular &quot;they&quot; has been traditional. 
Since the 18th century it has been prescribed to use the masculine (&quot;he&quot;), but other solutions are now often preferred—see Gender-neutral language.

In languages with a neuter gender, such as Slavic and Germanic languages, the neuter is often used for indeterminate gender reference, particularly when the things referred to are not people. In some cases this may even apply when referring to people, particularly children. For example, in English, one may use &quot;it&quot; to refer to a child, particularly when speaking generically rather than about a particular child of known sex.

In Icelandic (which preserves a masculine–feminine–neuter distinction in both singular and plural), the neuter plural can be used for groups of people of mixed gender, when specific people are meant. For example:
* &#x27;They (.) had met in the forest when the old woman (.) was a young girl and the emperor (.) was only a prince.&#x27;
However, when referring to previously unmentioned groups of people or when referring to people in a generic way, especially when using an indefinite pronoun like &#x27;some&#x27; or &#x27;all&#x27;, the masculine plural is used. For example:
* &#x27;Some people have the habit of talking to themselves.&#x27;
An example contrasting the two ways to refer to groups is the following, taken from advertisements of Christian congregations announcing their meetings:
* &#x27;All welcome&#x27; is understood to be more general whereas is more specific and emphasises the individuality of the group members.
That the masculine is seen in Icelandic as the most generic or &#x27;unmarked&#x27; of the three genders can also be seen in the fact that the nouns for most professions are masculine. Even feminine job descriptions historically filled by women, like &#x27;nurse&#x27; and &#x27;nursery school teacher&#x27; (both .), have been replaced with masculine ones as men have started becoming more represented in these professions: &#x27;nurse&#x27; and &#x27;nursery school teacher&#x27; (both .).

In Swedish (which has an overall common–neuter gender system), masculinity may be argued to be a marked feature, because in the weak adjectival declension there is a distinct ending () for naturally masculine nouns (as in , &quot;my little brother&quot;). In spite of this, the third-person singular masculine pronoun would normally be the default for a person of unknown gender, although in practice the indefinite pronoun and the reflexive or its possessive forms usually make this unnecessary.

In Polish, where a gender-like distinction is made in the plural between &quot;masculine personal&quot; and all other cases (see below), a group is treated as masculine personal if it contains at least one male person.

In languages which preserve a three-way gender division in the plural, the rules for determining the gender (and sometimes number) of a coordinated noun phrase (&quot;... and ...&quot;) may be quite complex. Czech is an example of such a language, with a division (in the plural) between masculine animate, masculine inanimate, feminine, and neuter. The rules for gender and number of coordinated phrases in that language are summarized at .

=== Arbitrary conventional criteria ===
In some languages, any gender markers have been so eroded over time (possibly through deflexion) that they are no longer recognizable. Many German nouns, for example, do not indicate their gender through either meaning or form. In such cases a noun&#x27;s gender must simply be memorized, and gender can be regarded as an integral part of each noun when considered as an entry in the speaker&#x27;s lexicon. (This is reflected in dictionaries, which typically indicate the gender of noun headwords where applicable.)

Second-language learners are often encouraged to memorize a modifier, usually a definite article, in conjunction with each noun—for example, a learner of French may learn the word for &quot;chair&quot; as (meaning &quot;the chair&quot;); this carries the information that the noun is , and that it is feminine (because is the feminine singular form of the definite article).

== Gender shifts ==
It is possible for a noun to have more than one gender. Such gender shifts are sometimes correlated with meaning shifts, and sometimes yield doublets with no difference in meaning. Moreover, gender shifts sometimes crosscuts number contrasts, such that the singular form of a noun has one gender, and plural form of the noun has a different gender.

=== Meaningful ===
Gender shift may be associated with a difference in the sex of the referent, as with nouns such as in Spanish, which may be either masculine or feminine, depending on whether it refers to a male or a female. It may also correspond to some other difference in the meaning of the word. For example, the German word meaning &quot;lake&quot; is masculine, whereas the identical word meaning &quot;sea&quot; is feminine. The meanings of the Norwegian noun have diverged further: masculine is &quot;a thing&quot;, whereas neuter is &quot;an assembly&quot;. (The parliament is the , &quot;the Great &quot;; the other s like are the regional courts.)

It is a matter of analysis how to draw the line between a single polysemous word with multiple genders and a set of homonyms with one gender each. For example, Bulgarian has a pair of homonyms () which are etymologically unrelated. One is masculine and means &quot;finger&quot;; the other is feminine and means &quot;soil&quot;.

=== Meaningless ===
In other cases, a word may be usable in multiple genders indifferently. For example, in Bulgarian the word , (, &quot;wilderness&quot;) may be either masculine (definite form , ) or feminine (definite form , ) without any change in meaning and no preference in usage.

In Norwegian, many nouns can be either feminine or masculine according to the dialect, level of formality or whim of the speaker/writer. Even the two written forms of the language have many nouns whose gender is optional. Choosing the masculine gender will often seem more formal than using the feminine. This might be because before the creation of Norwegian Nynorsk and Norwegian Bokmål in the late 19th century, Norwegians wrote in Danish, which has lost the feminine gender, thus usage of the masculine gender (corresponding exactly to Danish common gender in conjugation in Norwegian Bokmål) is more formal sounding to modern Norwegians.

The word for &quot;sun&quot; can be another example. One might decline it masculine: , or feminine: , in Norwegian Bokmål. The same goes for a lot of common words like (book), (doll), (bucket) and so forth. Many of the words where it is possible to choose gender are inanimate objects that one might suspect would be conjugated with the neuter gender. Nouns conjugated with the neuter gender cannot normally be conjugated as feminine or masculine in Norwegian. There is also a slight tendency towards using the masculine indefinite article even when choosing the feminine conjugation of a noun in many eastern Norwegian dialects. For instance, the word for &quot;girl&quot; is declined: .

=== Associated with number contrasts===
Sometimes a noun&#x27;s gender can change between its plural and singular forms, as with the French words (&quot;love&quot;), (&quot;delight&quot;) and (&quot;organ&quot; as musical instrument), all of which are masculine in the singular but feminine in the plural. These anomalies may have a historical explanation ( used to be feminine in the singular too) or result from slightly different notions ( in the singular is usually a barrel organ, whereas the plural usually refers to the collection of columns in a church organ). Further examples are the Italian words (&quot;egg&quot;) and (&quot;arm&quot;). These are masculine in the singular, but form the irregular plurals and , which have the endings of the feminine singular, but have feminine plural agreement. (This is related to the forms of the second declension Latin neuter nouns from which they derive: and , with nominative plurals and .) In other cases, the anomaly can be explained by the form of the noun, as is the case in Scottish Gaelic. Masculine nouns which form their plural by palatalization of their final consonant can change gender in their plural form, as a palatalized final consonant is often a marker of a feminine noun, e.g. (&quot;small boy&quot;), but (&quot;small boys&quot;), with the adjective showing agreement for both feminine gender (lenition of initial consonant) and plural number (suffixed ).

== Gender across languages ==
Related languages need not assign the same gender to a noun: this shows that gender can vary across related languages. Conversely, unrelated languages that are in contact can impact how a borrowed noun is assigned gender, with either the borrowing or the donor language determining the gender of the borrowed word.

=== Gender can vary across related languages ===
Nouns which have the same meanings in different languages need not have the same gender. This is particularly so in the case of things with no natural gender, such as sexless objects. For example, there is, by all appearances, nothing about a table that should cause it to be associated with any particular gender, and different languages&#x27; words for &quot;table&quot; are found to have various genders: feminine, as with the French ; masculine, as with German ; or neuter, as with Norwegian . (Even within a given language, nouns that denote the same concept may differ in gender—for example, of three German words for &quot;car&quot;, is masculine whereas is neuter, and is feminine.)

Cognate nouns in closely related languages are likely to have the same gender, because they tend to inherit the gender of the original word in the parent language. For instance, in the Romance languages, the words for &quot;sun&quot; are masculine, being derived from the Latin masculine noun , whereas the words for &quot;moon&quot; are feminine, being derived from the Latin feminine . (This contrasts with the genders found in German, where &quot;sun&quot; is feminine, and &quot;moon&quot; is masculine, as well as in other Germanic languages.) However, there are exceptions to this principle. For instance, (&quot;milk&quot;) is masculine in Italian (as are French and Portuguese ), whereas Spanish is feminine and Romanian is neuter. Likewise, the word for &quot;boat&quot; is neuter in German (), but common gender in Swedish ().

Some more examples of the above phenomena are given below. (These come mostly from the Slavic languages, where gender largely correlates with the noun ending.)
* The Russian word (&quot;moon&quot;) is feminine, whereas (&quot;crescent moon&quot;, also meaning &quot;month&quot;) is masculine. In Polish, another Slavic language, the word for moon is , which is masculine.
* Russian also has two words for &quot;potato&quot;: which is masculine, and which is feminine.
* In Polish the loanword (&quot;tram&quot;) is masculine, whereas the cognate loanword in Czech, , is feminine.
* The Polish word (&quot;thousand&quot;) is masculine, whereas the cognate in Russian, тысяча, is feminine, while the Icelandic cognate is neuter.
* The Spanish word (&quot;origin&quot;) is masculine, but its close relatives (from Portuguese), (from Asturian) and from Galician are feminine.
* The French word (&quot;team&quot;) is feminine, while the Spanish word is masculine. The Spanish form contrasts with the Portuguese /, both of which are feminine.
* The Italian word (&quot;ape&quot;) is feminine, whereas the Spanish word is masculine.
* The French word is feminine, but the Spanish cognate is generally masculine (except in some poetic contexts and among sea workers), whereas the Catalan cognate can be masculine or feminine, depending on the dialect. All these words mean &quot;sea&quot; and are descended from the Latin , which was neuter.

=== How languages assign gender to borrowed words ===
Borrowed words are assigned gender in one of two ways:
* via criteria determined by the borrowing language;
* via criteria determined by the donor language.

==== Borrowing language can determine gender ====
Ibrahim identifies several processes by which a language assigns a gender to a newly borrowed word; these processes follow patterns by which even children, through their subconscious recognition of patterns, can often correctly predict a noun&#x27;s gender.
# If the noun is animate, natural gender tends to dictate grammatical gender.
# The borrowed word tends to take the gender of the native word it replaces. According to Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, morphemic adaptations of English words into American Italian or British Italian are abundant with such cases. For example, the feminine gender of the British Italian word &quot;bag&quot; was induced by the feminine gender of the Italian word &quot;bag&quot;.
# If the borrowed word happens to have a suffix that the borrowing language uses as a gender marker, the suffix tends to dictate gender.
# If the borrowed word rhymes with one or more native words, the latter tend to dictate gender.
# The default assignment is the borrowing language&#x27;s unmarked gender.
# Rarely, the word retains the gender it had in the donor language. This tends to happen more frequently in more formal language such as scientific terms, where some knowledge of the donor language can be expected.

Sometimes the gender of a word switches with time. For example, the Russian modern loanword () &quot;whisky&quot; was originally feminine, then masculine, and today it has become neuter.

==== Donor language can determine gender ====
Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann argues that the cross-lingual retention of grammatical gender can change not only the lexis of the target language but also its morphology. For example, gender can indirectly influence the productivity of noun-patterns in what he calls the &quot;Israeli&quot; language: the Israeli neologism (, ) is fitted into the &quot;feminine&quot; noun-pattern &quot;mi⌂⌂é⌂et&quot; (each ⌂ represents a slot where a radical is inserted) because of the feminine gender of the matched words for &quot;brush&quot; such as Arabic , Yiddish , Russian , Polish () and , German and French , all feminine.

Similarly, argues Zuckermann, the Israeli neologism for &quot;library&quot;, (), matches the feminine gender of the parallel pre-existent European words: Yiddish , Russian , Polish , German and French , as well as of the pre-existent Arabic word for &quot;library&quot;: (, also feminine. The result of this neologism might have been, more generally, the strengthening of Israeli () as a productive feminine locative suffix (combined with the influence of Polish and Russian ()).

== Distribution of gender in the world&#x27;s languages ==

Grammatical gender is a common phenomenon in the world&#x27;s languages. A typological survey of 174 languages revealed that over one fourth of them had grammatical gender. Gender systems rarely overlap with numerical classifier systems. Gender and noun class systems are usually found in fusional or agglutinating languages, whereas classifiers are more typical of isolating languages. Thus, according to Johanna Nichols, these characteristics correlate positively with the presence of grammatical gender in the world&#x27;s languages:
* location in an area with languages featuring noun classes;
* preference for head-marking morphology;
* moderate to high morphological complexity;
* non-accusative alignment.

Grammatical gender is found in many Indo-European languages (including Spanish, French, Russian, and German—but not English, Bengali, Armenian or Persian, for example), Afroasiatic languages (which includes the Semitic and Berber languages, etc.), and in other language families such as Dravidian and Northeast Caucasian, as well as several Australian Aboriginal languages such as Dyirbal, and Kalaw Lagaw Ya. Most Niger–Congo languages also have extensive systems of noun classes, which can be grouped into several grammatical genders.

Conversely, grammatical gender is usually absent from the Koreanic, Japonic, Tungusic, Turkic, Mongolic, Austronesian, Sino-Tibetan, Uralic and most Native American language families.

Modern English makes use of gender in pronouns, which are generally marked for natural gender, but lacks a system of gender concord within the noun phrase which is one of the central elements of grammatical gender in most other Indo-European languages.

=== Indo-European ===
Many Indo-European languages, but not English, provide examples of grammatical gender.

Research indicates that the earliest stages of Proto-Indo-European had two genders (animate and inanimate), as did Hittite, the earliest attested Indo-European language. The classification of nouns based on animacy and inanimacy and the lack of gender are today characteristic of Armenian. According to the theory, the animate gender, which (unlike the inanimate) had independent vocative and accusative forms, later split into masculine and feminine, thus originating the three-way classification into masculine, feminine and neuter.

Many Indo-European languages retained the three genders, including most Slavic languages, Latin, Sanskrit, Ancient and Modern Greek, German, Icelandic, Romanian and Asturian (two Romance language exceptions). In them, there is a high but not absolute correlation between grammatical gender and declensional class. Many linguists believe that to be true of the middle and late stages of Proto-Indo-European.

However, many languages reduced the number of genders to two. Some lost the neuter, leaving masculine and feminine like most Romance languages (see . A few traces of the neuter remain, such as the distinct Spanish pronoun and Italian nouns with so-called &quot;mobile gender&quot;), as well as Hindustani and the Celtic languages. Others merged feminine and masculine into a common gender but retained the neuter, as in Swedish and Danish (and, to some extent, Dutch; see Gender in Danish and Swedish and Gender in Dutch grammar). Finally, some languages, such as English and Afrikaans, have nearly completely lost grammatical gender (retaining only some traces, such as the English pronouns &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, and &quot;it&quot;—Afrikaans , , , and ); Armenian, Bengali, Persian, Sorani, Ossetic, Odia, Khowar, and Kalasha have lost it entirely.

On the other hand, some Slavic languages can be argued to have added new genders to the classical three (see below).

==== Germanic: English ====

Although grammatical gender was a fully productive inflectional category in Old English, Modern English has a much less pervasive gender system, primarily based on natural gender and reflected essentially in pronouns only.

There are a few traces of gender marking in Modern English:
* Some words take different derived forms depending on the natural gender of the referent, such as &quot;waiter/waitress&quot; and &quot;widow/widower&quot;.
* The third-person singular personal pronouns (and their possessive forms) are gender specific: &quot;he/him/his&quot; (masculine gender, used for men, boys, and male animals), &quot;she/her(s)&quot; (feminine gender, for women, girls, and female animals), the singular &quot;they/them/their(s)&quot; (common gender, used for people or animals of unknown, irrelevant, or non-binary gender), and &quot;it/its&quot; (neuter gender, mainly for objects, abstractions and animals). (There are also distinct personal and non-personal forms but no differentiation by natural gender in the case of certain interrogative and relative pronouns: &quot;who/whom&quot; for persons, corresponding to &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, and the singular &quot;they&quot;; and &quot;which&quot; corresponding to &quot;it&quot;.)

However, these are relatively insignificant features compared with a typical language with full grammatical gender. English nouns are not generally considered to belong to gender classes in the way that French, German or Russian nouns are. There is no gender agreement in English between nouns and their modifiers (articles, other determiners, or adjectives, with the occasional exception such as &quot;blond/blonde&quot;, a spelling convention borrowed from French). Gender agreement applies in effect only to pronouns, with the choice of pronoun determined through semantics and/or pragmatics rather than on any conventional assignment of particular nouns to particular genders.

Only a relatively small number of English nouns have distinct male and female forms; many of them are loanwords from non-Germanic languages (the suffixes &quot;-rix&quot; and &quot;-ress&quot; in words such as &quot;aviatrix&quot; and &quot;waitress&quot;, for instance, derive directly or indirectly from Latin). English has no live productive gender markers. An example of such a marker might be the suffix &quot;-ette&quot; (of French provenance), but this is seldom used today, surviving mostly in either historical contexts or with disparaging or humorous intent.

The gender of an English pronoun typically coincides with the natural gender of its referent, rather than with the grammatical gender of its antecedent. The choice between &quot;she&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, and &quot;it&quot; comes down to whether the pronoun is intended to designate a woman, a man, or someone or something else. There are certain exceptions, however:
* With animals, &quot;it&quot; is usually used, but when the sex of the animal is known, it may be referred to as &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; (particularly when expressing an emotional connection with the animal, as with a pet). See also above.
* Certain nonhuman things can be referred to with the pronoun &quot;she&quot; (&quot;her&quot;, &quot;hers&quot;), particularly countries and ships, and sometimes other vehicles or machines. See . This usage is considered a metaphorical figure of speech; it is also in decline, and advised against by most journalistic style guides.

Problems arise when selecting a personal pronoun to refer to someone of unspecified or unknown gender (see also above). In the past and to some degree still in the present, the masculine has been used as the &quot;default&quot; gender in English. The use of the plural pronoun &quot;they&quot; with singular reference is common in practice. The neuter &quot;it&quot; may be used for a baby but not normally for an older child or adult. (Other genderless pronouns exist, such as the impersonal pronoun &quot;one&quot;, but they are not generally substitutable for a personal pronoun.) For more information see Gender-neutral language and Singular &quot;they&quot;.

==== Slavic languages ====
The Slavic languages mostly continue the Proto-Indo-European system of three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter. Gender correlates largely with noun endings (masculine nouns typically end in a consonant, feminines in and neuters in or ) but there are many exceptions, particularly in the case of nouns whose stems end in a soft consonant. However, some of the languages, including Russian, Czech, Slovak and Polish, also make certain additional grammatical distinctions between animate and inanimate nouns: Polish in the plural, and Russian in the accusative case, differentiate between human and non-human nouns.

In Russian, the different treatment of animate nouns involves their accusative case (and that of adjectives qualifying them) being formed identically to the genitive rather than to the nominative. In the singular that applies to masculine nouns only, but in the plural it applies in all genders. See Russian declension.

A similar system applies in Czech, but the situation is somewhat different in the plural: Only masculine nouns are affected, and the distinctive feature is a distinct inflective ending for masculine animate nouns in the nominative plural and for adjectives and verbs agreeing with those nouns. See Czech declension.

Polish might be said to distinguish five genders: personal masculine (referring to male humans), animate non-personal masculine, inanimate masculine, feminine, and neuter. The animate–inanimate opposition for the masculine gender applies in the singular, and the personal–impersonal opposition, which classes animals along with inanimate objects, applies in the plural. (A few nouns denoting inanimate things are treated grammatically as animate and vice versa.) The manifestations of the differences are as follows:
* In the singular, masculine animates (in the standard declension) have an accusative form identical to the genitive, and masculine inanimates have accusative identical to the nominative. The same applies to adjectives qualifying these nouns, the same as in Russian and Czech. Also, Polish masculine animates always form their genitive in , whereas in the case of inanimates some use and some :
::animate: (&quot;good customer&quot;; nominative); (accusative and genitive)
::animate: (&quot;good dog&quot;; nominative); (accusative and genitive)
::inanimate: (&quot;good cheese&quot;; nominative and accusative); (genitive only)
* In the plural, masculine personal nouns (but not other animate nouns) take accusatives that are identical to the genitives; they also typically take different endings in the nominative (e.g. rather than ). Such endings also appear on adjectives and past tense verbs. The two features are analogous to features of Russian and Czech respectively, except that those languages make an animate/inanimate distinction rather than personal/impersonal) . Examples of the Polish system:
::personal: (&quot;good customers&quot;; nominative); (accusative and genitive)
::impersonal: (&quot;good dogs&quot;; nominative and accusative); (genitive only)
::impersonal: (&quot;good cheeses&quot;; nominative and accusative); (genitive only)

A few nouns have both personal and impersonal forms, depending on meaning (for example, may behave as an impersonal noun when it refers to a client in the computing sense). For more information on the above inflection patterns, see Polish morphology. For certain rules concerning the treatment of mixed-gender groups, see above.

=== Dravidian ===
In the Dravidian languages, nouns are classified primarily on the basis of their semantic properties. The highest-level classification of nouns is often described as being between &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;nonrational&quot;. Nouns representing humans and deities are considered rational, and other nouns (those representing animals and objects) are treated as nonrational. Within the rational class there are further subdivisions into masculine, feminine and collective nouns. For further information, see Tamil grammar.

=== Austronesian ===
In the Austronesian Wuvulu-Aua language, vocative words used when addressing a relative often specify the speaker&#x27;s gender. For example, means &#x27;sister of female&#x27;, means opposite-gender sibling, and means female&#x27;s father&#x27;s sister or female&#x27;s brother&#x27;s daughter.

<text>Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) movements are social movements that advocate for LGBTQ people in society. Although there is not a primary or an overarching central organization that represents all LGBTQ people and their interests, numerous LGBTQ rights organizations are active worldwide. The first organization to promote LGBTQ rights was the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, founded in 1897 in Berlin.

A commonly stated goal among these movements is equal rights for LGBTQ people, often focusing on specific goals such as ending the criminalization of homosexuality or enacting same-sex marriage. Others have focused on building LGBTQ communities or worked towards liberation for the broader society from biphobia, homophobia, and transphobia. LGBTQ movements organized today are made up of a wide range of political activism and cultural activity, including lobbying, street marches, social groups, media, art, and research.

== Overview ==


Sociologist Mary Bernstein writes: &quot;For the lesbian and gay movement, then, cultural goals include (but are not limited to) challenging dominant constructions of masculinity and femininity, homophobia, and the primacy of the gendered heterosexual nuclear family (heteronormativity). Political goals include changing laws and policies to gain new rights, benefits, and protections from harm&quot;. Bernstein emphasizes that activists seek both types of goals in both the civil and political spheres.

As with other social movements, there is also conflict within and between LGBTQ movements, especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who represents the constituency of these movements, and this also applies to changing education. There is debate over the extent that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people, as well as others, share common interests and a need to work together. Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the 1970s, &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians, feminine gay men, transgender people, and bisexuals from the public eye, creating internal divisions within LGBTQ communities. Roffee and Waling (2016) documented that LGBTQ people experience microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviors from other people within the LGBTQ community. This is due to misconceptions and conflicting views as to what entails &quot;LGBT&quot;. For example, transgender people found that other members of the community were not understanding toward their own, individual, specific needs and would instead make ignorant assumptions, and this could cause health risks. Additionally, bisexual people found that lesbian or gay people were not understanding or appreciative of bisexual sexuality. Evidently, even though most of these people would say that they stand for the same values as the majority of the community, there are still remaining inconsistencies even within the LGBTQ community.

LGBTQ movements have often adopted a kind of identity politics that sees gay, bisexual, and transgender people as a fixed class of people; a minority group or groups, and this is very common among LGBTQ communities. Those using this approach aspire to liberal political goals of freedom and equal opportunity, and aim to join the political mainstream on the same level as other groups in society. In arguing that sexual orientation and gender identity are innate and cannot be consciously changed, attempts to change gay, lesbian, and bisexual people into heterosexuals (&quot;conversion therapy&quot;) are generally opposed by the LGBTQ community. Such attempts are often based on religious beliefs that perceive gay, lesbian, and bisexual activity as immoral. Religion has, however, never been univocal opposed to either homosexuality, bisexuality or being transgender, usually treating sex between men and sex between women differently. As of today, numerous religious communities and many believers in various religions are generally accepting of LGBTQ rights.

However, others within LGBTQ movements have criticized identity politics as limited and flawed, elements of the queer movement have argued that the categories of gay and lesbian are restrictive, and attempted to deconstruct those categories, which are seen to &quot;reinforce rather than challenge a cultural system that will always mark the non heterosexual as inferior.&quot;

After the French Revolution the anticlerical feeling in Catholic countries coupled with the liberalizing effect of the Napoleonic Code made it possible to sweep away sodomy laws. However, in Protestant countries, where the church was less severe, there was no general reaction against statutes that were religious in origin. As a result, many of those countries retained their statutes on sodomy until late in the 20th century. However, some countries have still retained their statutes on sodomy. For example, in 2008 a case in India&#x27;s High Court was judged using a 150-year-old reading that was punishing sodomy.

== History ==
=== Enlightenment era ===
In eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe, same-sex sexual behavior and cross-dressing were widely considered to be socially unacceptable, and were serious crimes under sodomy and sumptuary laws. There were, however, some exceptions. For example, in the 17th-century cross-dressing was common in plays, as evident in the content of many of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and by the actors in actual performance (since female roles in Elizabethan theater were always performed by males, usually prepubescent boys).

Thomas Cannon wrote what may be the earliest published defense of homosexuality in English, &quot;Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplify&#x27;d&quot; (1749). Although only fragments of his work have survived, it was a humorous anthology of homosexual advocacy, written with an obvious enthusiasm for its subject. It contains the argument: &quot;Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts: Are not they, however, constructed, and consequently impelling Nature?&quot;
Social reformer Jeremy Bentham wrote the first known argument for homosexual law reform in England around 1785, at a time when the legal penalty for buggery was death by hanging. His advocacy stemmed from his utilitarian philosophy, in which the morality of an action is determined by the net consequence of that action on human well-being. He argued that homosexuality was a victimless crime, and therefore not deserving of social approbation or criminal charges. He regarded popular negative attitudes against homosexuality as an irrational prejudice, fanned and perpetuated by religious teachings. However, he did not publicize his views as he feared reprisal; his powerful essay was not published until 1978.

The emerging currents of secular humanist thought that had inspired Bentham also informed the French Revolution, and when the newly formed National Constituent Assembly began drafting the policies and laws of the new republic in 1792, groups of militant &quot;sodomite-citizens&quot; in Paris petitioned the Assemblée nationale, the governing body of the French Revolution, for freedom and recognition. In 1791, France became the first nation to decriminalize homosexuality, probably thanks in part to Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, who was one of the authors of the Napoleonic Code. With the introduction of the Napoleonic Code in 1808, the Duchy of Warsaw also decriminalized homosexuality.

In 1830, the new Penal Code of the Brazilian Empire did not repeat the title XIII of the fifth book of the &quot;Ordenações Philipinas&quot;, which made sodomy a crime. In 1833, an anonymous English-language writer wrote a poetic defense of Captain Nicholas Nicholls, who had been sentenced to death in London for sodomy:

&lt;poem&gt;Whence spring these inclinations, rank and strong?
And harming no one, wherefore call them wrong?&lt;/poem&gt;

Three years later in Switzerland, Heinrich Hoessli published the first volume of &quot;Eros: Die Männerliebe der Griechen&quot; (English: &quot;Eros: The Male Love of the Greeks&quot;), another defense of same-sex love.

=== Emergence of LGBT movement ===


In many ways, social attitudes to homosexuality became more hostile during the late Victorian era. In 1885, the Labouchere Amendment was included in the Criminal Law Amendment Act, which criminalized &#x27;any act of gross indecency with another male person&#x27;; a charge that was successfully invoked to convict playwright Oscar Wilde in 1895 with the most severe sentence possible under the Act.

The first person known to describe himself as a drag queen was William Dorsey Swann, born enslaved in Hancock, Maryland. Swann was the first American on record who pursued legal and political action to defend the LGBTQ community&#x27;s right to assemble. During the 1880s and 1890s, Swann organized a series of drag balls in Washington, D.C. Swann was arrested in police raids numerous times, including in the first documented case of arrests for female impersonation in the United States, on April 12, 1888.

From the 1870s, social reformers began to defend homosexuality, but due to the controversial nature of their advocacy, kept their identities secret. The Uranian poets and prose writers, who sought to rehabilitate the love between men and boys and in doing so often appealed to Ancient Greece, formed a rather cohesive group with a well-expressed philosophy. A secret British society called the Order of Chaeronea campaigned for the legalization of homosexuality. The society was founded in 1897 by George Cecil Ives, one of the earliest gay rights campaigners, who had been working for the end of oppression of homosexuals, what he called the &quot;Cause&quot;. Members included Oscar Wilde, Charles Kains Jackson, Samuel Elsworth Cottam, Montague Summers, and John Gambril Nicholson. Ives met Wilde at the Authors&#x27; Club in London in 1892. Wilde was taken by his boyish looks and persuaded him to shave off his mustache, and once kissed him passionately in the Travellers&#x27; Club. In 1893, Lord Alfred Douglas, with whom he had a brief affair, introduced Ives to several Oxford poets whom Ives also tried to recruit.

John Addington Symonds was a poet and an early advocate of male love. In 1873, he wrote &quot;A Problem in Greek Ethics&quot;, a work of what would later be called &quot;gay history.&quot; Although the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; credits the medical writer C.G. Chaddock for introducing &quot;homosexual&quot; into the English language in 1892, Symonds had already used the word in &quot;A Problem in Greek Ethics&quot;.

Symonds also translated classical poetry on homoerotic themes, and wrote poems drawing on ancient Greek imagery and language such as &quot;Eudiades&quot;, which has been called &quot;the most famous of his homoerotic poems&quot;. While the taboos of Victorian England prevented Symonds from speaking openly about homosexuality, his works published for a general audience contained strong implications and some of the first direct references to male-male sexual love in English literature. By the end of his life, Symonds&#x27; homosexuality had become an open secret in Victorian literary and cultural circles. In particular, Symonds&#x27; memoirs, written over a four-year period, from 1889 to 1893, form one of the earliest known works of self-conscious homosexual autobiography in English. The recently decoded autobiographies of Anne Lister are an earlier example in English.

Another friend of Ives was the English socialist poet Edward Carpenter. Carpenter thought that homosexuality was an innate and natural human characteristic and that it should not be regarded as a sin or a criminal offense. In the 1890s, Carpenter began a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, possibly in response to the recent death of Symonds, whom he viewed as his campaigning inspiration. His 1908 book on the subject, &quot;The Intermediate Sex&quot;, would become a foundational text of the LGBT movements of the 20th century. Scottish anarchist John Henry Mackay also wrote in defense of same-sex love and androgyny.

English sexologist Havelock Ellis wrote the first objective scientific study of homosexuality in 1897, in which he treated it as a neutral sexual condition. Called &quot;Sexual Inversion&quot; it was first printed in German and then translated into English a year later. In the book, Ellis argued that same-sex relationships could not be characterized as a pathology or a crime and that its importance rose above the arbitrary restrictions imposed by society. He also studied what he called &#x27;inter-generational relationships&#x27; and that these also broke societal taboos on age difference in sexual relationships. The book was so controversial at the time that one bookseller was charged in court for holding copies of the work. It is claimed that Ellis coined the term &#x27;homosexual&#x27;, but in fact he disliked the word due to its conflation of Greek and Latin.

These early proponents of LGBT rights, such as Carpenter, were often aligned with a broader socio-political movement known as &#x27;free love&#x27;; a critique of Victorian sexual morality and the traditional institutions of family and marriage that were seen to enslave women. Some advocates of free love in the early 20th century, including Russian anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman, also spoke in defense of same-sex love and challenged repressive legislation.

An early LGBT movement also began in Germany at the turn of the 20th century, centering on the doctor and writer Magnus Hirschfeld. In 1897 he formed the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee campaign publicly against the notorious law &quot;Paragraph 175&quot;, which made sex between men illegal. Adolf Brand later broke away from the group, disagreeing with Hirschfeld&#x27;s medical view of the &quot;intermediate sex&quot;, seeing male-male sex as merely an aspect of manly virility and male social bonding. Brand was the first to use &quot;outing&quot; as a political strategy, claiming that German Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow engaged in homosexual activity.

The 1901 book &quot;Sind es Frauen? Roman über das Dritte Geschlecht&quot; (English: &quot;Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex&quot;) by Aimée Duc was as much a political treatise as a novel, criticizing pathological theories of homosexuality and gender inversion in women. Anna Rüling, delivering a public speech in 1904 at the request of Hirschfeld, became the first female Uranian activist. Rüling, who also saw &quot;men, women, and homosexuals&quot; as three distinct genders, called for an alliance between the women&#x27;s and sexual reform movements, but this speech is her only known contribution to the cause. Women only began to join the previously male-dominated sexual reform movement around 1910 when the German government tried to expand Paragraph 175 to outlaw sex between women. Heterosexual feminist leader Helene Stöcker became a prominent figure in the movement. Friedrich Radszuweit published LGBT literature and magazines in Berlin (e.g., &quot;Die Freundin&quot;).

Hirschfeld, whose life was dedicated to social progress for people who were transsexual, transvestite and homosexual, formed the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sexology) in 1919. The institute conducted an enormous amount of research, saw thousands of transgender and homosexual clients at consultations, and championed a broad range of sexual reforms including sex education, contraception and women&#x27;s rights. However, the gains made in Germany would soon be drastically reversed with the rise of Nazism, and the institute and its library were destroyed in 1933. The Swiss journal Der Kreis was the only part of the movement to continue through the Nazi era.

USSR&#x27;s Criminal Code of 1922 decriminalized homosexuality. This was a remarkable step in the USSR at the time – which was very backward economically and socially, and where many conservative attitudes towards sexuality prevailed. This step was part of a larger project of freeing sexual relationships and expanding women&#x27;s rights – including legalizing abortion, granting divorce on demand, equal rights for women, and attempts to socialize housework. During Stalin&#x27;s era, however, USSR reverted all these progressive measures – re-criminalizing homosexuality and imprisoning gay men and banning abortion.

In 1928, English writer Radclyffe Hall published a novel titled &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;. Its plot centers on Stephen Gordon, a woman who identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot;, and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris. The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and was intended to be a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted. Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s theories and rejected (conservatively understood version of) Freud&#x27;s theory that same-sex attraction was caused by childhood trauma and was curable.

In the United States, several secret or semi-secret groups were formed explicitly to advance the rights of homosexuals as early as the turn of the 20th century, but little is known about them. A better documented group is Henry Gerber&#x27;s Society for Human Rights formed in Chicago in 1924, which was quickly suppressed.

=== Homophile movement (1945–1969) ===

Immediately following World War II, a number of homosexual rights groups came into being or were revived across the Western world, in Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries and the United States. These groups usually preferred the term &quot;homophile&quot; to &quot;homosexual&quot;, emphasizing love over sex. The homophile movement began in the late 1940s with groups in the Netherlands and Denmark, and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s with groups in Sweden, Norway, the United States, France, Britain and elsewhere. ONE, Inc., the first public homosexual organization in the U.S., was bankrolled by the wealthy transsexual man Reed Erickson. A U.S. transgender rights journal, &quot;Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress&quot;, also published two issues in 1952.

The homophile movement lobbied to establish a prominent influence in political systems of social acceptability. Radicals of the 1970s would later disparage the homophile groups for being assimilationist. Any demonstrations were orderly and polite. By 1969, there were dozens of homophile organizations and publications in the U.S., and a national organization had been formed, but they were largely ignored by the media. A 1965 gay march held in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, according to some historians, marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the LGBT youth organization Vanguard was formed by Adrian Ravarour to demonstrate for equality, and Vanguard members protested for equal rights during the months of April–July 1966, followed by the August 1966 Compton&#x27;s riot, where transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of Tenderloin rioted against police harassment at a popular all-night restaurant, Gene Compton&#x27;s Cafeteria.

The Wolfenden Report was published in Britain on September 4, 1957, after publicized convictions for homosexuality of well-known men, including Edward Montagu-Scott, 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu. Disregarding the conventional ideas of the day, the committee recommended that &quot;homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence&quot;. All but James Adair were in favor of this and, contrary to some medical and psychiatric witnesses&#x27; evidence at that time, found that &quot;homosexuality cannot legitimately be regarded as a disease, because in many cases it is the only symptom and is compatible with full mental health in other respects.&quot; The report added, &quot;The law&#x27;s function is to preserve public order and decency, to protect the citizen from what is offensive or injurious, and to provide sufficient safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others ... It is not, in our view, the function of the law to intervene in the private life of citizens, or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behavior.&quot;

The report eventually led to the introduction of the Sexual Offences Bill 1967 supported by Labour MP Roy Jenkins, then the Labour Home Secretary. When passed, the Sexual Offenses Act decriminalized homosexual acts between two men over 21 years of age &quot;in private&quot; in England and Wales. The seemingly innocuous phrase &#x27;in private&#x27; led to the prosecution of participants in sex acts involving three or more men, e.g. the Bolton 7 who were so convicted as recently as 1998.

Bisexual activism became more visible toward the end of the 1960s in the United States. In 1966 bisexual activist Robert A. Martin (also known as Donny the Punk) founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University. In 1967 Columbia University officially recognized this group, thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group. Activism on behalf of bisexuals in particular also began to grow, especially in San Francisco. One of the earliest organizations for bisexuals, the Sexual Freedom League in San Francisco, was facilitated by Margo Rila and Frank Esposito beginning in 1967. Two years later, during a staff meeting at a San Francisco mental health facility serving LGBT people, nurse Maggi Rubenstein came out as bisexual. Due to this, bisexuals began to be included in the facility&#x27;s programs for the first time.

=== Gay Liberation movement (1969–1974) ===
The new social movements of the sixties, such as the Black Power and anti-Vietnam war movements in the US, the May 1968 insurrection in France, and Women&#x27;s Liberation throughout the Western world, inspired many LGBT activists to become more radical, and the Gay Liberation movement emerged towards the end of the decade. This new radicalism is often attributed to the Stonewall riots of 1969, when a group of gay men, lesbians, drag queens and transgender women at a bar in New York City resisted a police raid.

Immediately after Stonewall, such groups as the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and the Gay Activists&#x27; Alliance (GAA) were formed. Their use of the word &quot;gay&quot; represented a new unapologetic defiance—as an antonym for &quot;straight&quot; (&quot;respectable sexual behavior&quot;), it encompassed a range of non-normative sexuality and sought ultimately to free the bisexual potential in everyone, rendering obsolete the categories of homosexual and heterosexual. According to Gay Lib writer Toby Marotta, &quot;their Gay political outlooks were not homophile but liberationist&quot;. &quot;Out, loud and proud,&quot; they engaged in colorful street theater. The GLF&#x27;s &quot;A Gay Manifesto&quot; set out the aims for the fledgling gay liberation movement, and influential intellectual Paul Goodman published &quot;The Politics of Being Queer&quot; (1969). Chapters of the GLF were established across the U.S. and in other parts of the Western world. The Front homosexuel d&#x27;action révolutionnaire was formed in 1971 by lesbians who split from the Mouvement Homophile de France.

The Gay liberation movement overall, like the gay community generally and historically, has had varying degrees of gender nonconformity and assimilationist platforms among its members. Early marches by the Mattachine society and Daughters of Bilitis stressed looking &quot;respectable&quot; and mainstream, and after the Stonewall Uprising the Mattachine Society posted a sign in the window of the club calling for peace. Gender nonconformity has always been a primary way of signaling homosexuality and bisexuality, and by the late 1960s and mainstream fashion was increasingly incorporating what by the 1970s would be considered &quot;unisex&quot; fashions. In 1970, the drag queen caucus of the GLF, including Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, formed the group Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), which focused on providing support for gay prisoners, housing for homeless gay youth and street people, especially other young &quot;street queens&quot;. In 1969, Lee Brewster and Bunny Eisenhower formed the Queens Liberation Front (QLF), partially in protest to the treatment of the drag queens at the first Christopher Street Liberation Day March.

One of the values of the movement was gay pride. Within weeks of the Stonewall Riots, Craig Rodwell, proprietor of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop in lower Manhattan, persuaded the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) to replace the Fourth of July Annual Reminder at Independence Hall in Philadelphia with a first commemoration of the Stonewall Riots. Liberation groups, including the Gay Liberation Front, Queens, the Gay Activists Alliance, Radicalesbians, and Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries (STAR) all took part in the first Gay Pride Week. Los Angeles held a big parade on the first Gay Pride Day. Smaller demonstrations were held in San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston.

In the United Kingdom the GLF had its first meeting in the basement of the London School of Economics on October 13, 1970. Bob Mellors and Aubrey Walter had seen the effect of the GLF in the United States and created a parallel movement based on revolutionary politics and alternative lifestyle.

By 1971, the UK GLF was recognized as a political movement in the national press, holding weekly meetings of 200 to 300 people. The GLF Manifesto was published, and a series of high-profile direct actions, were carried out.

The disruption of the opening of the 1971 Festival of Light was the best organized of GLF action. The Festival of Light, whose leading figures included Mary Whitehouse, met at Methodist Central Hall. Groups of GLF members in drag invaded and spontaneously kissed each other; others released mice, sounded horns, and unveiled banners, and a contingent dressed as workmen obtained access to the basement and shut off the lights.

In 1972, Sweden became the first country in the world to allow people who were transsexual by legislation to surgically change their sex and provide free hormone replacement therapy. Sweden also permitted the age of consent for same-sex partners to be at age 15, making it equal to heterosexual couples.

Bisexuals became more visible in the LGBT rights movement in the 1970s. In 1972 a Quaker group, the Committee of Friends on Bisexuality, issued the &quot;Ithaca Statement on Bisexuality&quot; supporting bisexuals. In that same year the National Bisexual Liberation Group formed in New York. In 1976 the San Francisco Bisexual Center opened.tzerland started with Rosa von Praunheims movie It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives.

Easter 1972 saw the Gay Lib annual conference held in the Guild of Undergraduates Union (students union) building at the University of Birmingham.

In May 1974 the American Psychiatric Association, after years of pressure from activists, changed the wording concerning homosexuality in the Sixth printing of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders from a &quot;mental disorder&quot; to that of a &quot;sexual orientation disturbance&quot;. While still not a flattering description, it took gay people out of the category of being automatically considered mentally ill simply for their sexual orientation.
By 1974, internal disagreements had led to the movement&#x27;s splintering. Organizations that spun off from the movement included the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard, &quot;Gay News&quot;, and Icebreakers. The GLF Information Service continued for a few further years providing gay related resources. GLF branches had been set up in some provincial British towns (e.g., Bradford, Bristol, Leeds, and Leicester) and some survived for a few years longer. The Leicester group founded by Jeff Martin was noted for its involvement in the setting up of the local &quot;Gayline&quot;, which is still active today and has received funding from the National Lottery. They also carried out a high-profile campaign against the local paper, the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot;, which refused to advertise Gayline&#x27;s services at the time.

In Japan, LGBT groups were established in the 1970s. In 1971, Ken Togo ran for the Upper House election.

=== LGBT rights movement (1974–present) ===

==== 1974–1986 ====

From the radical Gay Liberation movement of the early 1970s arose a more reformist and single-issue Gay Rights movement, which portrayed gays and lesbians as a minority group and used the language of civil rights—in many respects continuing the work of the homophile period. In Berlin, for example, the radical was eclipsed by the .

Gay and lesbian rights advocates argued that one&#x27;s sexual orientation does not reflect on one&#x27;s gender; that is, &quot;you can be a man and desire a man... without any implications for your gender identity as a man,&quot; and the same is true if you are a woman. Gays and lesbians were presented as identical to heterosexuals in all ways but private sexual practices, and butch &quot;bar dykes&quot; and flamboyant &quot;street queens&quot; were seen as negative stereotypes of lesbians and gays. Veteran activists such as Sylvia Rivera and Beth Elliot were sidelined or expelled because they were transgender.

In 1974, Maureen Colquhoun came out as the first Lesbian Member of Parliament (MP) for the Labour Party in the UK. When elected she was married in a heterosexual marriage.

In 1975, the groundbreaking film portraying homosexual gay icon Quentin Crisp&#x27;s life, &quot;The Naked Civil Servant&quot;, was transmitted by Thames Television for the British Television channel ITV. The British journal &quot;Gay Left&quot; also began publication. After British Home Stores sacked an openly gay trainee Tony Whitehead, a national campaign subsequently picketed their stores in protest.

In 1977, Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors becoming the first openly gay man in the State of California to be elected to public office. Milk was assassinated by a former city supervisor Dan White in 1978.

In 1977, a former Miss America contestant and orange juice spokesperson, Anita Bryant, began a campaign &quot;Save Our Children&quot;, in Dade County, Florida (greater Miami), which proved to be a major setback in the Gay Liberation movement. Essentially, she established an organization which put forth an amendment to the laws of the county which resulted in the firing of many public school teachers on the suspicion that they were homosexual.

In 1979, a number of people in Sweden called in sick with a case of &quot;being homosexual,&quot; in protest of homosexuality being classified as an illness. This was followed by an activist occupation of the main office of the National Board of Health and Welfare. Within a few months, Sweden became the first country in the world to remove homosexuality as an illness.

Between 1980 and 1988, the international gay community rallied behind Eliane Morissens, a Belgian lesbian who had been fired from her teaching post for coming out on television and bringing attention to employment discrimination. The case prompted protests, articles, and fundraising events throughout Europe and the Americas. Articles were carried in Toronto&#x27;s &quot;The Body Politic&quot;, the &quot;Gay Community News&quot; of Boston; and the &quot;San Francisco Sentinel&quot;. The French magazine &quot;Gai pied&quot; created a support network to organize demonstrations and launched a petition drive for subscribers and members of the International Gay Association (IGA) to call on the Council of Europe to renounce discrimination against homosexuals. The International Lesbian Information Service (ILIS) published information in their newsletter about letter-writing campaigns, and organized fund-raisers and solidarity protests to help pay for Morissens&#x27; legal and personal expenses and bring attention to the case. Both ILIS and IGA lobbied European teachers&#x27; unions in support of Morissens. Though Morissens appealed the school board decision to the local council; the highest court in Belgium, Council of State; and the European Court of Human Rights, her termination was upheld at every level. The LGBT community was disappointed in the outcome because each court of appeal refused to recognize or examine whether employment discrimination had occurred, accepting the employer&#x27;s version of events, and narrowly examining freedom of expression.

Lesbian feminism, which was most influential from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, encouraged women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and advocated lesbianism as the logical result of feminism. As with Gay Liberation, this understanding of the lesbian potential in all women was at odds with the minority-rights framework of the Gay Rights movement. Many women of the Gay Liberation movement felt frustrated at the domination of the movement by men and formed separate organisations; some who felt gender differences between men and women could not be resolved developed &quot;lesbian separatism,&quot; influenced by writings such as Jill Johnston&#x27;s 1973 book &quot;Lesbian Nation&quot;. Organizers at the time focused on this issue. Diane Felix, also known as DJ Chili D in the Bay Area club scene, is a Latino American lesbian once joined the Latino American queer organization GALA. She was known for creating entertainment spaces specifically for queer women, especially in Latino American community. These places included gay bars in San Francisco such as A Little More and Colors. Disagreements between different political philosophies were, at times, extremely heated, and became known as the lesbian sex wars, clashing in particular over views on sadomasochism, prostitution and transsexuality. The term &quot;gay&quot; came to be more strongly associated with homosexual males.

In Canada, the coming into effect of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1985 saw a shift in the gay rights movement in Canada, as Canadian gays and lesbians moved from liberation to litigious strategies. Premised on Charter protections and on the notion of the immutability of homosexuality, judicial rulings rapidly advanced rights, including those that compelled the Canadian government to legalize same-sex marriage. It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety, dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals, its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may have undermined opportunities for more meaningful change.

Mark Segal, often referred to as the dean of American gay journalism, disrupted the CBS evening news with Walter Cronkite in 1973, an event covered in newspapers across the country and viewed by 60% of American households, many seeing or hearing about homosexuality for the first time.

Another setback in the United States occurred in 1986, when the US Supreme Court upheld a Georgia anti-sodomy law in the case &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;. (This ruling would be overturned two decades later in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;).

==== 1987–2000 ====
===== AIDS pandemic =====

Some historians posit that a new era of the gay rights movement began in the 1980s with the emergence of AIDS. As gay men became seriously ill and died in ever-increasing numbers, and many lesbian activists became their caregivers, the leadership of many organizations was decimated. Other organizations shifted their energies to focus their efforts on AIDS. This era saw a resurgence of militancy with direct action groups like AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed in 1987, as well as its offshoots Queer Nation (1990) and the Lesbian Avengers (1992). Some younger activists, seeing &quot;gay and lesbian&quot; as increasingly normative and politically conservative, began using &quot;queer&quot; as a defiant statement of all sexual minorities and gender variant people—just as the earlier liberationists had done with &quot;gay&quot;. Less confrontational terms that attempt to reunite the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people also became prominent, including various acronyms like &quot;LGBT&quot;, &quot;LGBTQ&quot;, and &quot;LGBTI&quot;, where the &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;I&quot; stand for &quot;queer&quot; or &quot;questioning&quot; and &quot;intersex&quot;, respectively.

===== Warrenton &quot;War Conference&quot; =====
A &quot;War Conference&quot; of 200 gay leaders was held in Warrenton, Virginia, in 1988. The closing statement of the conference set out a plan for a media campaign: 
The statement also called for an annual planning conference &quot;to help set and modify our national agenda.&quot; The Human Rights Campaign lists this event as a milestone in gay history and identifies it as where National Coming Out Day originated.

On June 24, 1994, the first Gay Pride march was celebrated in Asia in the Philippines. In the Middle East, LGBT organizations remain illegal, and LGBT rights activists face extreme opposition from the state. The 1990s also saw the emergence of many LGBT youth movements and organizations such as LGBT youth centers, gay–straight alliances in high schools, and youth-specific activism, such as the National Day of Silence. Colleges also became places of LGBT activism and support for activists and LGBT people in general, with many colleges opening LGBT centers.

The 1990s also saw a rapid push of the transgender movement, while at the same time a &quot;sidelining of the identity of those who are transsexual.&quot; In the English-speaking world, Leslie Feinberg published &quot;Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come&quot; in 1992. Gender-variant peoples across the globe also formed minority rights movements. Hijra activists campaigned for recognition as a third sex in India and Travesti groups began to organize against police brutality across Latin America while activists in the United States formed direct-confrontation groups such as the Transexual Menace.

==== 21st century ====

===== Same-sex marriage =====
, same-sex marriages are recognized in Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay.

The Netherlands was the first country to allow same-sex marriage in 2001. Following with Belgium in 2003 and Spain and Canada in 2005. South Africa became the first African nation to legalize same-sex marriage in 2006, and is currently the only African nation where same-sex marriage is legal. Despite this uptick in tolerance of the LGBT community in South Africa, so-called corrective rapes have become prevalent in response, primarily targeting the poorer women who live in townships and those who have no recourse in responding to the crimes because of the notable lack of police presence and prejudice they may face for reporting assaults.

On 22 October 2009, the assembly of the Church of Sweden, voted strongly in favour of giving its blessing to homosexual couples, including the use of the term marriage, (&quot;matrimony&quot;).

Iceland became the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage through a unanimous vote: 49–0, on 11 June 2010. A month later, Argentina became the first country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage.

On 26 June 2015, in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-to-4 that the Constitution requires that same-sex couples be allowed to marry no matter where they live in the United States. With this ruling, the United States became the 17th country to legalize same-sex marriages entirely.

Between 12 September and 7 November 2017, Australia held a national survey on the subject of same sex marriage; 61.6% of respondents supported legally recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. This cleared the way for a private member&#x27;s bill to be debated in the federal parliament.

In 2019, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to allow same-sex marriage. There has been a legal movement attempting to recognise marriage equality in Japan.

===== Other rights =====
In 2003, in the case &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down sodomy laws in fourteen states, making consensual homosexual sex legal in all 50 states, a significant step forward in LGBT activism and one that had been fought for by activists since the inception of modern LGBT social movements.

From November 6 to 9, 2006, The Yogyakarta Principles on application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity was adopted by an international meeting of 29 specialists in Yogyakarta, the International Commission of Jurists and the International Service for Human Rights.

During this same period, some municipalities have been enacting laws against homosexuality. For example, Rhea County, Tennessee, unsuccessfully tried to &quot;ban homosexuals&quot; in 2006.

The 1993 &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; law, forbidding homosexual people from serving openly in the United States military, was repealed in 2010. This meant that gays and lesbians could now serve openly in the military without any fear of being discharged because of their sexual orientation. In 2012, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity issued a regulation to prohibit discrimination in federally-assisted housing programs. The new regulations ensure that the department&#x27;s core housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

The UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity gathered 66 signatures in the United Nations General Assembly on December 13, 2008.
In early 2014 a series of protests organized by Add The Words, Idaho, and former state senator Nicole LeFavour, some including civil disobedience and concomitant arrests, took place in Boise, Idaho, which advocated adding the words &quot;sexual orientation&quot; and &quot;gender identity&quot; to the state&#x27;s Human Rights act.

On September 6, 2018, consensual gay sex was legalized in India by their Supreme Court.

In June 2020, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the 1964 Civil Rights Act could protect gay and transgender people from workplace discrimination. The Bostock v. Clayton County decision found that protections guaranteed on the basis of sex could extend to sexual orientation and identity in areas like housing and employment. Democrats such as then-presidential candidate Joe Biden praised the decision. Due to a lack of federal protections, discrimination against LGBT people in public accommodation or the sale of goods and services by private businesses remains legal, leaving vulnerable those in more than half the states in the U.S.

In October 2020, the Council of Europe&#x27;s Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Unit, along with the European Court of Human Rights, held a conference to mark the 70th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights on October 8, 2020. The entity announced launching an event called &quot;A &#x27;Living Instrument&#x27; for Everyone: The Role of the European Convention on Human Rights in Advancing Equality for LGBTI persons&quot;, focused on the progress achieved in equality for LGBTI persons in Europe through the European Convention mechanism.

President Biden signed an executive order barring LGBTQ discrimination on his first day in office. Later the same year, Biden reversed a Trump-era policy of banning transgender people from the military, authorized embassies to fly the pride flag, and officially recognized June as Pride Month.

== LGBT and human rights ==
Some people worry that gay rights conflict with individuals&#x27; freedom of speech, religious freedoms in the workplace, and the ability to run churches, charitable organizations and other religious organizations that hold opposing social and cultural views to LGBT rights. There is also concern that religious organizations might be forced to accept and perform same-sex marriages or risk losing their tax-exempt status.

Freedom of religion may, however, also protect LGBT people. As pointed out at the United Nations Human Rights Council in the 2023 formal report of the United Nations Independent Expert on sexual orientation and gender identity on the basis of the explanation in a 2020 article by human rights expert Dag Øistein Endsjø, adherents of denominations and belief systems who embrace LGBT-equality &quot;can claim that anti-LGBT manifestations of religion (such as criminalization and discrimination) not only impinge upon the right of LGBT people to be free from violence and discrimination based on SOGI [sexual orientation and gender identity], but also violate the [pro-LGBT] denominations&#x27; own rights of freedom of religion&quot;. As pointed out in this article, freedom of religion also generally protects LGBT people against religious oppression, as freedom of religion also protects the “freedom ... not to hold religious beliefs and ... not to practise a religion”. As the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief noted in 2017, “in certain States where religion has been given ‘official’ or privileged status, other fundamental rights of individuals – especially women, religious minorities and members of the LGBTI community – are disproportionately restricted or vitiated under threat of sanctions as a result of obligatory observation of State-imposed religious orthodoxy.”

== Public opinion ==
LGBT movements are opposed by a variety of individuals and organizations. They may have a personal, political or religious prejudice to gay rights, homosexual relations or gay people. Opponents say same-sex relationships are not marriages, that legalization of same-sex marriage will open the door for the legalization of polygamy, that it is unnatural and that it encourages unhealthy behavior. Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermines the traditional family and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother. As society in some countries (mostly in Western Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Taiwan) has become more accepting of homosexuality, there therefore has also been the emergence of many groups that desire to end homosexuality; during the 1990s, one of the best known groups that was established with this goal is the ex-gay movement.

Eric Rofes author of the book, &quot;A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer?&quot;, argues that the inclusion of teachings on homosexuality in public schools will play an important role in transforming public ideas about lesbian and gay individuals. As a former teacher in the public school system, Rofes recounts how he was fired from his teaching position after making the decision to come out as gay. As a result of the stigma that he faced as a gay teacher he emphasizes the necessity of the public to take radical approaches to making significant changes in public attitudes about homosexuality. According to Rofes, radical approaches are grounded in the belief that &quot;something fundamental needs to be transformed for authentic and sweeping changes to occur. &quot;The radical approaches proposed by Rofes have been met with strong opposition from anti-gay rights activists such as John Briggs. Former California senator, John Briggs proposed Proposition 6, a ballot initiative that would require that all California state public schools fire any gay or lesbian teachers or counselors, along with any faculty that displayed support for gay rights in an effort to prevent what he believe to be &quot;the corruption of the children&#x27;s minds&quot;. The exclusion of homosexuality from the sexual education curriculum, in addition to the absence of sexual counseling programs in public schools, has resulted in increased feelings of isolation and alienation for gay and lesbian students who desire to have gay counseling programs that will help them come to terms with their sexual orientation. Eric Rofes founder of youth homosexual programs, such as Out There and Committee for Gay Youth, stresses the importance of having support programs that help youth learn to identify with their sexual orientation.

David Campos, author of the book, &quot;Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook&quot;, illuminates the argument proposed by proponents of sexual education programs in public schools. Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of heterosexuality are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them. However, Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for LGBT youth. It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased, factual information about sexual orientation, along with supportive counseling programs for these homosexual youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality.

Many opponents of LGBT social movements have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality as being a result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals. In opposition to this claim, many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that educators should refrain from teaching about sexuality in schools entirely. In her book entitled &quot;Gay and Lesbian Movement,&quot; Margaret Cruikshank provides statistical data from the Harris and Yankelovich polls which confirmed that over 80% of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school. In addition, the poll also found that 75% of parents believe that homosexuality and abortion should be included in the curriculum as well. An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only 2% of all parents actually disapproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school.
It had been suggested that education has a positive impact on support for same sex marriage. African Americans statistically have lower rates of educational achievement; however, the education level of African Americans does not have as much significance on their attitude towards same-sex marriage as it does on white attitudes. Educational attainment among whites has a significant positive effect on support for same-sex marriage, whereas the direct effect of education among African Americans is less significant. The income levels of whites have a direct and positive correlation with support for same-sex marriage, but African American income level is not significantly associated with attitudes toward same-sex marriage.
Location also affects ideas towards same-sex marriage; residents of rural and southern areas are significantly more opposed to same-sex marriage in comparison to residents elsewhere. Gays and lesbians that live in rural areas face many challenges, including: sparse populations and the traditional culture held closely by the small population of most rural areas, generally hostile social climates towards gays relative to urban areas, and less social and institution support and access compared to urban areas. In order to combat this problem that the LGBT community faces, social networks and apps such as Moovs have been created for &quot;LGBT individuals with like-minds&quot; that are &quot;enabled to connect, share, and feel the heartbeat of the community as one.&quot;

In a study conducted by Darren E. Sherkat, Kylan M. de Vries, and Stacia Creek at the Southern Illinois University Carbondale, researchers found that women tend to be more consistently supportive of LGBT rights than men and that individuals that are divorced or have never married are also more likely to grant marital rights to same-sex couples than married or widowed individuals. They also claimed that white women are significantly more supportive than white men, but there are no gender discrepancies among African Americans. The year in which one was born was also found to be a strong indicator of attitude towards same-sex marriage—generations born after 1946 are considerably more supportive of same-sex marriage than older generations. Finally, the study reported that statistically African Americans are more opposed to same-sex marriage than any other ethnicity.

Studies show that Non-Protestant Christians are much more likely to support same-sex unions than Protestants; 63% of African Americans claim that they are Baptist or Protestant, whereas only 30% of white Americans are. Religion, as measured by individuals&#x27; religious affiliations, behaviors, and beliefs, has a lot of influence in structuring same-sex union attitudes and consistently influences opinions about homosexuality. The most liberal attitudes are generally reflected by Jews, liberal Protestants, and people who are not affiliated with religion. This is because many of their religious traditions have not &quot;systematically condemned homosexual behaviors&quot; in recent years. Moderate and tolerant attitudes are generally reflected by Catholics and moderate Protestants. And lastly, the most conservative views are held by Evangelical Protestants. Moreover, it is a tendency for one to be less tolerant of homosexuality if their social network is strongly tied to a religious congregation. Organized religion, especially Protestant and Baptist affiliations, espouse conservative views which traditionally denounce same-sex unions. Therefore, these congregations are more likely to hear messages of this nature. Polls have also indicated that the amount and level of personal contact that individuals have with homosexual individuals and traditional morality affects attitudes of same-sex marriage and homosexuality.

<text>The Great Victoria Desert is a sparsely populated desert ecoregion and interim Australian bioregion in Western Australia and South Australia.

==History==
In 1875, British-born Australian explorer Ernest Giles became the first European to cross the desert. He named the desert after the then-reigning monarch, Queen Victoria. In 1891, David Lindsey&#x27;s expedition travelled across this area from north to south. Frank Hann was looking for gold in this area between 1903 and 1908. Len Beadell explored the area in the 1960s.

==Location and description==
The Great Victoria is the largest desert in Australia, and consists of many small sandhills, grassland plains, areas with a closely packed surface of pebbles (called desert pavement or gibber plains), and salt lakes. It is over wide (from west to east) and covers an area of from the Eastern Goldfields region of Western Australia to the Gawler Ranges in South Australia. The Western Australian mulga shrublands ecoregion lies to the west, the Little Sandy Desert to the northwest, the Gibson Desert and the Central Ranges xeric shrublands to the north, the Tirari-Sturt stony desert to the east, and the Nullarbor Plain to the south separates it from the Southern Ocean. Average annual rainfall is low and irregular, ranging from per year. Thunderstorms are relatively common in the Great Victoria Desert, with an average of 15–20 thunderstorms yearly. Summer daytime temperatures range from , while in winter, this falls to .

The Great Victoria desert is a World Wildlife Fund ecoregion and an Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia region of the same name.

==Habitation==

The majority of people living in the region are Indigenous Australians from different groups, including the Kogara, the Mirning and the Pitjantjatjara. Aboriginal populations have been increasing in this region. Young Indigenous adults from the Great Victoria Desert region work in the Wilurarra Creative programs to maintain and develop their culture.

Despite its isolated location, the Great Victoria is bisected by very rough tracks, including the Connie Sue Highway and the Anne Beadell Highway. Human activity has included some mining and nuclear weapons testing.

==Flora==
Only the hardiest of plants can survive in much of this environment. Between the sand ridges, the areas of wooded steppe consist of &quot;Eucalyptus gongylocarpa&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptus youngiana&quot;, and &quot;Acacia aneura&quot; (mulga) shrubs scattered over areas of resilient spinifex grasses, particularly &quot;Triodia basedowii&quot;.

==Fauna==
The wildlife that adapted to these harsh conditions include a few large birds or mammals such as emus and red kangaroos. However, the desert does sustain many types of lizards, including the vulnerable great desert skink (&quot;Egernia kintorei&quot;), the Central Ranges taipan (discovered in 2007), and a number of small marsupials, including the endangered sandhill dunnart &quot;(Sminthopsis psammophila)&quot; and the crest-tailed mulgara &quot;(Dasycercus cristicauda)&quot;. One way to survive here is to burrow into the sands, as a number of the desert&#x27;s animals, including the southern marsupial mole &quot;(Notoryctes typhlops)&quot;, and the water-holding frog do. Birds include the chestnut-breasted whiteface (&quot;Aphelocephala pectoralis&quot;) found on the eastern edge of the desert and the malleefowl of Mamungari Conservation Park. Predators of the desert include the dingo (as the desert is north of the Dingo Fence) and two large monitor lizards, the perentie &quot;(Varanus giganteus)&quot; and the sand goanna &quot;(Varanus gouldii)&quot;.

==Conservation and threats==
As this area has had very limited use for agriculture, many habitats remain largely undisturbed. 31% of the desert is in protected areas, including Mamungari Conservation Park (formerly known as Unnamed Conservation Park) in South Australia, a large area of pristine arid zone wilderness, which possesses cultural significance and is one of the 14 World Biosphere Reserves in Australia. Habitat is also preserved in the large Aboriginal local government area of Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara in South Australia and in the Great Victoria Desert Nature Reserve of Western Australia. Protected areas include:
* Antara-Sandy Bore Indigenous Protected Area
* Apara-Makiri-Punti Indigenous Protected Area
* De La Poer Range Nature Reserve
* Gawler Ranges National Park
* Gawler Ranges Conservation Park
* Great Victoria Desert Nature Reserve
* Kalka-Pipalyatjara Indigenous Protected Area
* Lake Gairdner National Park
* Mamungari Conservation Park
* Mount Willoughby Indigenous Protected Area
* Neale Junction Nature Reserve
* Ngaanyatjarra Indigenous Protected Area
* Nullarbor Regional Reserve
* Plumridge Lakes Nature Reserve
* Pureba Conservation Park
* Queen Victoria Spring Nature Reserve
* Tallaringa Conservation Park 
* Walalkara Indigenous Protected Area
* Watarru Indigenous Protected Area
* Yellabinna Regional Reserve
* Yellabinna Wilderness Protection Area
* Yeo Lake Nature Reserve
* Yumbarra Conservation Park

The nuclear weapons trials carried out by the United Kingdom at Maralinga and Emu Field in the 1950s and early 1960s have left areas contaminated with plutonium-239 and other radioactive material.

<doc id="13073" wikidata="Q192897" url="?curid=13073" title="GNU Lesser General Public License">
<text>The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a free-software license published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own (even proprietary) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components. However, any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license. For proprietary software, code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library, so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components. The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries, although it is also used by some stand-alone applications.

The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License (GPL) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License. The word &quot;Lesser&quot; in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user&#x27;s complete freedom in the use of software; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL, but not for any proprietary components.

==History==
The license was originally called the GNU Library General Public License and was first published in 1991, and adopted the version number 2 for parity with GPL version 2. The LGPL was revised in minor ways in the 2.1 point release, published in 1999, when it was renamed the GNU Lesser General Public License to reflect the FSF&#x27;s position that not all libraries should use it. Version 3 of the LGPL was published in 2007 as a list of additional permissions applied to GPL version 3.

In addition to the term &quot;work based on the Program&quot; of GPL, LGPL version 2 introduced two additional clarification terms &quot;work based on the library&quot; and &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. LGPL version 3 partially dropped these terms.

==Differences from the GPL==
The main difference between the GPL and the LGPL is that the latter allows the work to be linked with (in the case of a library, &quot;used by&quot;) a non-(L)GPLed program, regardless of whether it is licensed under a license of GPL family or other licenses. In LGPL 2.1, the non-(L)GPLed program can then be distributed under any terms if it is not a derivative work. If it is a derivative work, then the program&#x27;s terms must allow for &quot;modification of the work for the customer&#x27;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications&quot;. Whether a work that uses an LGPL program is a derivative work or not is a legal issue. A standalone executable that dynamically links to a library through a .so, .dll, or similar medium is generally accepted as not being a derivative work as defined by the LGPL. It would fall under the definition of a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Paragraph 5 of the LGPL version 2.1 states:

:A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

Essentially, if it is a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;, then it must be possible for the software to be linked with a newer version of the LGPL-covered program. The most commonly used method for doing so is to use &quot;a suitable shared library mechanism for linking&quot;. Alternatively, a statically linked library is allowed if either source code or linkable object files are provided.

==Compatibility==
One feature of the LGPL is the permission to sublicense under the GPL any piece of software which is received under the LGPL (see section 3 of the LGPL version 2.1, and section 2 option b of the LGPL version 3). This feature allows for direct reuse of LGPLed code in GPLed libraries and applications.

Version 3 of the LGPL is not inherently compatible with version 2 of the GPL. However, works using the latter that have given permission to use a later version of the GPL are compatible: a work released under the GPLv2 &quot;or any later version&quot; may be combined with code from a LGPL version 3 library, with the combined work as a whole falling under the terms of the GPLv3.

==FSF recommendations on library licensing==
The former name &quot;GNU Library General Public License&quot; gave some the impression that the FSF recommended that all software libraries should use the LGPL and programs should use the GPL. In 1999 essay &quot;Why you shouldn&#x27;t use the Lesser GPL for your next library&quot; Richard Stallman explained that while the LGPL had not been deprecated, one should not necessarily use the LGPL for all libraries, as using GPL can give advantage to free-software developers.

==Programming language specifications==
The license uses terminology which is mainly intended for applications written in the C programming language or its family. Franz Inc., the developers of Allegro Common Lisp, published their own preamble to the license to clarify terminology in the Lisp context. The LGPL with this preamble is sometimes referred to as the LLGPL.

In addition, Ada has a special feature, , which may prompt the use of the GNAT Modified General Public License (GMGPL): it allows code to link against or instantiate GMGPL-covered units without the code itself becoming covered by the GPL.

C++ templates and header-only libraries have the same problem as Ada generics. Version 3 of the LGPL addresses such cases in section 3.

===Class inheritance===
Some concern has risen about the suitability of object-oriented classes in LGPL-licensed code being inherited by non-(L)GPL code. Clarification is given on the official GNU website:

:The LGPL does not contain special provisions for inheritance, because none are needed. Inheritance creates derivative works in the same way as traditional linking, and the LGPL permits this type of derivative work in the same way as it permits ordinary function calls.

<text>Gosford is a waterfront city at the northern end of Brisbane Water on the Central Coast in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The Gosford Waterfront is known for its boating and scenic views on the shores of Brisbane Water. Gosford is the main commercial hub and gateway of the Central Coast. It is situated approximately north of Sydney and south of Newcastle. Gosford is located in the local government area of the Central Coast Council.

Gosford, locally nicknamed &#x27;Gossie&#x27;, is located in the north-eastern part of the Sydney Basin in the traditional Darkinjung Country.

The regional city is one of the two shared administrative hubs of the Central Coast Council, along with Wyong. Gosford is the central business district of the Central Coast region and is the third largest urban area in the state of New South Wales after Sydney and Newcastle. Gosford has been deemed a vital CBD spine under the NSW Metropolitan Strategy following the merging of City of Gosford Council and Wyong Shire Council in 2016, forming the current Central Coast Council administration. The population of the Gosford area was 169,053 in 2016.

==History==

Until white settlement, the area around Gosford was inhabited by the Guringai peoples, who were principally coastal-dwellers, and the Darkinjung people that inhabited the hinterland.
Along with the other land around the Hawkesbury River estuary, the Brisbane Water district was explored during the early stages of the settlement of New South Wales.

Gosford itself was explored by State Governor Arthur Phillip between 1788 and 1789. The area was difficult to access and settlement began around 1823. By the late 19th century the agriculture in the region was diversifying, with market gardens and citrus orchards occupying the rich soil left after the timber harvest. As late as 1850, the road between Hawkesbury (near Pittwater) and Brisbane Water was a cart wheel track.

Typical of early Colonial settlement, convicts lived and worked in the Gosford area. In 1825, Gosford&#x27;s population reached 100, of whom 50% were convicts.

East Gosford was the first centre of settlement. Gosford was named in 1839 after Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford – a friend of the then Governor of New South Wales George Gipps. Acheson&#x27;s title derives its name from Gosford, a townland (sub-division) of Markethill in County Armagh in Northern Ireland.

In 1887, the Main Northern railway line to Sydney was completed, requiring a bridge over the Hawkesbury River and a tunnel through the sandstone ridge west of Woy Woy. The introduction of this transport link and then the Pacific Highway in 1930 accelerated the development of the region. Electification of the line reached Gosford on 23 January 1960.

Gosford became a town in 1885 and was declared a municipality in 1886. It was then declared a Shire in 1947, and a City on 1 January 1980. 
Mann Street, the spine of the Gosford CBD has been the subject of much debate, with urban planners having ambitions to make Gosford a small smart regional city with various plans for a performing arts center, greater choice in cafes and restaurants, new library, high speed rail linkage to Sydney and Newcastle, better pedestrian access from the Gosford Hospital, education and research precinct over the railway lines to Mann Street and a new Central Coast University promised at State and Federal elections.

==Demographics==
As of the , there were 4,873 people in Gosford CBD. 58.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were India 5.0%, and Nepal 4.1%. 64.0% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Nepali at 3.8% and Mandarin at 3.3%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.1% and Catholic 15.8%.

The Gosford Statistical Area, which incorporates the whole of Gosford&#x27;s city and suburbs, includes Avoca Beach, Erina, Ettalong Beach, Kariong, Kincumber, Narara, Terrigal, Woy Woy, and Wyoming, and at the 2021 census had a population of 178,427.

==Geography==

===Climate===

Gosford has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa) with warm summers and mild winters. In summer, temperatures average about 27–28 °C in the day with high humidity and about 17–18 °C at night. Winters are mild with cool overnight temperatures and mild to occasionally warm daytime temperatures with lower humidity. Records range from a maximum of on 18 January 2013, to a low of on 16 July 1970.

Average rainfall is 1314.3 mm, much of which falls in the late summer and autumn. Rainfall is less common in late winter and early spring because of the foehn effect, as the city is located on the leeward side of the Great Dividing Range. The reason for the relatively high amount of annual rainfall compared to other places in the vicinity is the shape and orientation of the coastline which makes Gosford (and the Central Coast region in general) slightly more prone to rain from southerly winds.

===Central business district===
Gosford proper is located in a valley with President&#x27;s Hill on the city&#x27;s western border, Rumbalara Reserve on its eastern border, and Brisbane Water to the city&#x27;s south. Mann Street, Gosford&#x27;s main street and part of the Pacific Highway, runs north–south and contains the frontage for much of the commercial district.

In the centre of Gosford is a shopping and community precinct, including Kibble Park, William Street Mall, Gosford City Library, the Imperial Shopping Centre and a full range of shops, cafes, banks and services.

A renewed period of optimism has followed demolition of several derelict buildings and several infrastructure investment projects including the full fibre optic telecommunications rollout of the National Broadband Network in 2012 in the city&#x27;s CBD as well as the so-called Kibbleplex project, announced in 2013 that plans to house the new regional library, tertiary teaching rooms and associated organisations.

==Economy and infrastructure==

Gosford is situated along an identified business growth corridor between Erina, the West Gosford light industrial zone and Somersby. Connectivity of main roads and rail travel times between Sydney, the Central Coast and the Hunter region are key issues for corporate business relocation to the region. Aged and personal care and retail are major employers in Gosford.

As an entertainment hub, Mann Street enjoys relatively good public transport links and is one of the Central Coast&#x27;s most popular spots for pubs and clubs and in close proximity to cultural and sporting events.

Yacht and other boat building has been undertaken by East Coast Yachts since 1964 in West Gosford.

The club licence however reverted to Manly in 2003 and the club was dissolved.

The suburb of Gosford has one current club, the St. Edwards Bears, and one junior club, the Gosford Kariong Storm. The Storm were initially a senior club as well, formed from the merger of the Gosford Townies/Giants and the nearby Kariong Kookaburras.

The Central Coast Rugby Union features eight first grade clubs and is one of the strongest local rugby union competitions in the state.

<doc id="13076" wikidata="Q10648" url="?curid=13076" title="Gordon Brown">
<text>James Gordon Brown (born 20 February 1951) is a British politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Labour Party from 2007 to 2010, as well as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Tony Blair from 1997 to 2007. Brown has been the WHO Ambassador for Global Health Financing since 2021 and the UN Special Envoy for Global Education since 2012. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Dunfermline East from 1983 to 2005, and Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath from 2005 to 2015.

A doctoral graduate, Brown studied history at the University of Edinburgh. He spent his early career as a lecturer at a further education college and television journalist. Brown was elected to the House of Commons at the 1983 general election as the MP for Dunfermline East. He was appointed to Neil Kinnock&#x27;s shadow cabinet in 1989 and was appointed Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer by John Smith in 1992. Following Labour&#x27;s victory in the 1997 general election, Brown was appointed as Chancellor, becoming the longest-serving in modern history. Brown&#x27;s time as chancellor was marked by major reform of Britain&#x27;s monetary and fiscal policy architecture, transferring interest rate setting to the Bank of England, extension of powers of the Treasury to cover much domestic policy and transferring banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. Brown presided over the longest period of economic growth in British history. He outlined five economic tests, which resisted the UK adopting the euro. Controversial moves included the abolition of advance corporation tax (ACT) relief in his first budget, the sale of UK gold reserves from 1999 to 2002, and the removal in his final budget of the 10% starting rate of income tax which he had introduced in the 1999 budget.

Following Blair&#x27;s resignation in 2007, Brown was elected unopposed to succeed him as prime minister and party leader. The party continued as New Labour, though Brown&#x27;s style of government differed from Blair&#x27;s. He remained committed to close ties with the United States and to the war in Iraq, although he established an inquiry into the reasons for Britain&#x27;s participation in the conflict. Brown&#x27;s government introduced rescue packages to keep banks afloat during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, and so national debt increased. The government took majority shareholdings in Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland, which had experienced severe financial difficulties, and injected public money into other banks. In 2008, Brown&#x27;s government passed the world&#x27;s first Climate Change Act, and introduced the Equality Act 2010. Despite poll rises just after Brown became prime minister, after he failed to call a snap election in 2007, his popularity fell and Labour&#x27;s popularity declined with the Great Recession. Labour lost 91 seats in the 2010 general election, resulting in a hung parliament in which the Conservative Party won the most seats. After the Conservatives formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, Brown was succeeded as prime minister by Conservative leader David Cameron, and as Labour leader by Ed Miliband.

After leaving office, Brown returned to the backbenches, continuing to serve as MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath until he gave up his seat in 2015. He has since made occasional political interventions, and published political-themed books. Brown played a prominent role in the campaign to maintain the union during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, and in 2022 wrote a report on devolution for Labour leader Keir Starmer. Brown has served as the UN Special Envoy for Global Education and Ambassador for Global Health Financing for the World Health Organization. Brown was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour by King Charles III in the 2024 Birthday Honours for public and charitable services in the UK and abroad. As chancellor, Brown had high approval ratings and a poll of political scientists rated him the most successful post-war chancellor in terms of economic stability, working independently from the prime minister and leaving a lasting legacy on the British economy. His premiership has been viewed less favourably; although public opinion of Brown has improved since he left office, his premiership has been viewed as average in historical rankings and public opinion of British prime ministers.

==Early life==

James Gordon Brown was born at the Orchard Maternity Nursing Home in Giffnock, Renfrewshire, Scotland. His father was John Ebenezer Brown (1914–1998), a minister of the Church of Scotland and a strong influence on Brown. His mother was Jessie Elizabeth &quot;Bunty&quot; Brown (&quot;née&quot; Souter; 1918–2004); she was the daughter of John Souter, a timber merchant. The family moved to Kirkcaldy – then the largest town in Fife, across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh – when Gordon was three. Brown was brought up there with his elder brother John and younger brother Andrew in a manse; he is therefore often referred to as a &quot;son of the manse&quot;, an idiomatic Scottish phrase, similar to the American phrase &quot;preacher&#x27;s kid&quot;.

===Education===
Brown was educated first at Kirkcaldy West Primary School, where he was selected for an experimental fast stream education programme, which took him two years early to Kirkcaldy High School for an academic hothouse education taught in separate classes. Aged 16, he wrote that he loathed and resented this &quot;ludicrous&quot; experiment on young lives.

He was accepted by the University of Edinburgh to study history at the same early age of 16. During an end-of-term rugby union match at his old school, he received a kick to the head and experienced a retinal detachment. This left him blind in his left eye, despite treatment including several operations and weeks spent lying in a darkened room. Later at Edinburgh, while playing tennis, he noticed the same symptoms in his right eye. Brown underwent experimental surgery at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and his right eye was saved by a young eye surgeon, Hector Chawla. Brown graduated from Edinburgh with an undergraduate MA degree with First-Class Honours in history in 1972. He stayed on to obtain his PhD degree in history, which he gained ten years later in 1982, defending a thesis titled &quot;The Labour Party and Political Change in Scotland 1918–1929&quot;.

In his youth at the University of Edinburgh, Brown was involved in a romantic relationship with Margarita, Crown Princess of Romania. Margarita said about it: &quot;It was a very solid and romantic story. I never stopped loving him but one day it didn&#x27;t seem right anymore, it was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing.&quot; An unnamed friend of those years is quoted by Paul Routledge in his biography of Brown as recalling: &quot;She was sweet and gentle and obviously cut out to make somebody a very good wife. She was bright, too, though not like him, but they seemed made for each other.&quot;

In 1972, while still a student, Brown was elected Rector of the University of Edinburgh, the convener of the University Court. He served as Rector until 1975, and also edited the document &quot;The Red Paper on Scotland&quot;.

===Career before Parliament===
From 1976 to 1980 Brown was employed as a lecturer in politics at Glasgow College of Technology. He also worked as a tutor for the Open University. In the 1979 general election, Brown stood for the Edinburgh South constituency, losing to the Conservative candidate, Michael Ancram.

From 1980, he worked as a journalist at Scottish Television, later serving as current affairs editor until his election to Parliament in 1983.

==Election to Parliament and opposition==

Brown was elected to Parliament as a Labour MP at his second attempt, for Dunfermline East in the 1983 general election. His first Westminster office mate was a newly elected MP from the Sedgefield constituency, Tony Blair. Brown became an opposition spokesman on Trade and Industry in 1985. In 1986, he published a biography of the Independent Labour Party politician James Maxton, the subject of his doctoral thesis. Brown was Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1987 to 1989 and then Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, before becoming Shadow Chancellor in 1992 following Labour&#x27;s fourth consecutive defeat in the general election that year. Having led the &quot;Labour Movement Yes&quot; campaign, refusing to join the cross-party &quot;Yes for Scotland&quot; campaign, during the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum, while other senior Labour politicians – including Robin Cook, Tam Dalyell and Brian Wilson – campaigned for a &quot;No&quot; vote, Brown was subsequently a key participant in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, signing the Claim of Right for Scotland in 1989.

Labour leader John Smith died suddenly in May 1994. Brown did not contest the leadership after Tony Blair became the favourite to win the 1994 leadership election, deciding to make way for Blair to avoid splitting the pro-modernising vote in the leadership ballot. It has long been rumoured a deal was struck between Blair and Brown at the former Granita restaurant in Islington, in which Blair promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not standing against him in the leadership election. Whether this is true or not, the relationship between Blair and Brown was central to the fortunes of New Labour, and they mostly remained united in public, despite reported serious private rifts.

As Shadow Chancellor, Brown as Chancellor-in-waiting was seen as a good choice by business and the middle class. During his tenure as Chancellor, the rate of inflation sometimes exceeded the 2% target; the Governor of the Bank of England, under the rules governing the Bank&#x27;s role, wrote an explanatory letter to the Chancellor on each occasion inflation exceeded three per cent. Following a reorganisation of Westminster constituencies in Scotland in 2005, Brown became MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath at the general election.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer (1997–2007)==
In the 1997 general election, Labour defeated the Conservatives by a landslide to end their 18-year exile from government, and when Tony Blair, the new Prime Minister, announced his ministerial team on 2 May 1997, he appointed Brown as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Brown would remain in this role for 10 years and two months, making him the longest-serving Chancellor in modern history. Some achievements from Brown&#x27;s decade as chancellor included making the Bank of England independent and delivering an agreement on poverty and climate change at the G8 summit in 2005.

===Early economic reforms===
On taking office as chancellor, Brown gave the Bank of England operational independence in monetary policy, and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank&#x27;s Monetary Policy Committee. At the same time, he also changed the inflation measure from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity in Britain of the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

===Taxation and spending===
During the 1997 election campaign and subsequently, Brown pledged not to increase the basic or higher rates of income tax. Over his Chancellorship he reduced the basic rate from 23% to 20%; however, in all budgets but his final one, he increased the tax thresholds in line with inflation rather than with earnings, resulting in fiscal drag. Under Brown, corporation tax fell from a main rate of 33% to 28%, and from 24% to 19% for small businesses. In 1999, he introduced a lower income tax band of 10%. He abolished this 10% tax band in his last budget in 2007 to reduce the basic rate from 22% to 20%, increasing tax for 5 million people and, according to the calculations of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, leaving those earning between £5,000 and £18,000 as the biggest losers. To backbench cheers, Brown had described the measure in his last Budget thus: &quot;Having put in place more focused ways of incentivising work and directly supporting children and pensioners at a cost of £3bn a year, I can now return income tax to just two rates by removing the 10p band on non-savings income&quot;. Brown also implemented the Windfall Tax in 1997 on the privatised utilities. The tax produced an estimated one-off income to the government of £5 billion, which was used to fund the New Deal for Young People, a welfare-to-work program that sought to tackle long-term unemployment.

According to the OECD, UK taxation increased from a 39.3% share of gross domestic product in 1997 to 42.4% in 2006, going to a higher level than that of Germany. This increase has mainly been attributed to active government policy, and not simply to the growing economy. Conservatives have accused Brown of imposing &quot;stealth taxes&quot;. A commonly reported example resulted in 1997 from a technical change in the way corporation tax is collected, the indirect effect of which was for the dividends on stock investments held within pensions to be taxed, thus lowering pension returns and contributing to the demise of most of the final salary pension funds in the UK.

Brown&#x27;s 2000 Spending Review outlined a major expansion of government spending, particularly on health and education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased National Insurance to pay for health spending. He also introduced working tax credits, and in his last budget as Chancellor, Brown gave an extra £3 billion in pension allowances, an increase in the child tax credit, and an increase in the working tax credit. These increases were followed by another £1 billion of support for increases in the child tax credit.

Under Brown, the tax code, the standard guide to tax, doubled in length to 17,000 pages.

===European single currency===
In October 1997, Brown announced that the Treasury would set five economic tests to determine whether the economic case had been made for the United Kingdom to adopt the European single currency. The Treasury indicated that the tests had not been passed in June 2003.

===Other issues===
In 2000, Brown was accused of starting a political row about higher education (referred to as the Laura Spence affair) when he accused the University of Oxford of elitism in its admissions procedures, describing its decision not to offer a place to state school pupil Laura Spence as &quot;absolutely outrageous&quot;. Lord Jenkins, then Oxford Chancellor and himself a former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, said &quot;nearly every fact he used was false.&quot;

Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK&#x27;s gold reserves shortly before gold entered a protracted bull market, since nicknamed by dealers as the Brown Bottom or Brown&#x27;s Bottom. The official reason for selling the gold reserves was to reduce the portfolio risk of the UK&#x27;s reserves by diversifying away from gold. The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5 billion. By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion, leading to Brown&#x27;s decision to sell the gold being widely criticised. As of August 2024 the gold prize is approximately £1,905 per ounce, which would value the reserves sold at £26.5 billion.

As Chancellor, Brown argued against renationalising the railways, saying at the Labour conference in 2004 that it would cost £22 billion.

During his time as Chancellor, Brown reportedly believed that it was appropriate to remove most, but not all, of the unpayable Third World debt. On 20 April 2006, in a speech to the United Nations Ambassadors, Brown outlined a &quot;Green&quot; view of global development.

=== Labour leadership bid ===
In October 2004, Blair announced he would not lead the party into a fourth general election, but would serve a full third term. Political comment over the relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the 2005 election, which Labour won with a reduced majority and reduced vote share. Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year.

Brown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair; he was the only candidate spoken of seriously in Westminster. Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become prime minister, in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and global change. This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as prime minister; speaking at a Fabian Society conference on &#x27;The Next Decade&#x27; in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue &#x27;equality of opportunity and fairness of outcome&#x27;), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds in the war on terror as key priorities.

On 11 May 2007, after months of speculation, Brown formally announced his bid for the Labour leadership. He launched his campaign website the same day as formally announcing his bid for leadership, titled &quot;Gordon Brown for Britain&quot;. On 16 May, Channel 4 News announced that Andrew MacKinlay had nominated Brown, giving him 308 nominationsenough to avoid a leadership contest. A BBC report states that the decisive nomination was made by Tony Wright with MacKinlay yet to nominate at that point. Brown replaced Blair as Leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007.

==Prime Minister (2007–2010)==
After Blair tendered his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II, Brown was invited by the queen to form a government and become Prime Minister on 27 June 2007. In his first speech as prime minister, Brown said &quot;This will be a new government with new priorities and I have been privileged to have been granted the great opportunity to serve my country. And at all times I will be strong in purpose, steadfast in will, resolute in action, in the service of what matters to the British people, meeting the concerns and aspirations of our whole country.&quot;

Brown rescinded some of the policies which had been introduced or were planned by Blair&#x27;s administration. He remained committed to close ties with the United States and to the war in Iraq, although he established an inquiry into the reasons for Britain&#x27;s participation in the conflict. He proposed a &quot;government of all the talents&quot; which would involve co-opting leading personalities from industry and professional occupations into government positions. Brown also appointed Jacqui Smith as the UK&#x27;s first female Home Secretary, while Brown&#x27;s former position as chancellor of the exchequer was taken over by Alistair Darling. He proposed moving some traditional prime ministerial powers conferred by royal prerogative to the realm of Parliament, such as the power to declare war and approve appointments to senior positions. Brown wanted Parliament to gain the right to ratify treaties and have more oversight of the intelligence services. He also proposed moving some powers from Parliament to citizens, including the right to form &quot;citizens&#x27; juries&quot;, easily petition Parliament for new laws, and rally outside Westminster. He asserted that the attorney general should not have the right to decide whether to prosecute in individual cases, such as in the loans for peerages scandal.There was speculation during September and early October 2007 about whether Brown would call a snap general election. Indeed, the party launched the Not flash, just Gordon advertising campaign, which was seen largely as pre-election promotion of Brown as Prime Minister; however, Brown announced on 6 October that there would be no election any time soon – despite opinion polls showing that he was capable of winning an election should he call one. This proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives (led by David Cameron) in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in Crewe and Glasgow did himself and the government no favours either. Brown has since claimed that Labour would have won the 2007 election but he did not believe an early election was in the national interest.

His political opponents accused him of being indecisive, which Brown denied. In July 2008, he supported a new bill extending the pre-charge detention period to 42 days. The bill was met with opposition on both sides of the House and backbench rebellion. In the end, the bill passed by just nine votes. The House of Lords defeated the bill, with Lords characterising it as &quot;fatally flawed, ill thought through and unnecessary&quot;, stating that &quot;it seeks to further erode fundamental legal and civil rights&quot;.

Brown was mentioned by the press in the expenses crisis for claiming for the payment of his cleaner; however, no wrongdoing was found and the Commons Authority did not pursue Brown over the claim. Meanwhile, the Commons Fees Office stated that a double payment for a £153 plumbing repair bill was a mistake on their part and that Brown had repaid it in full.

===Domestic policy===

During his Labour leadership campaign Brown proposed some policy initiatives, which he called the &quot;manifesto for change&quot;.

The manifesto included a clampdown on corruption and a new Ministerial Code, which set out clear standards of behaviour for ministers. He also stated in a speech when announcing his bid that he wanted a &quot;better constitution&quot; that is &quot;clear about the rights and responsibilities of being a citizen in Britain today&quot;. He planned to set up an all-party convention to look at new powers for Parliament and to look at rebalancing powers between Whitehall and local government. Brown said he would give Parliament the final say on whether British troops were sent into action in future.

He said he wanted to release more land and ease access to ownership with shared equity schemes. He backed a proposal to build new eco-towns, each housing between 10,000 and 20,000 homeowners – up to 100,000 new homes in total.
Brown also said he wanted to have doctors&#x27; surgeries open at the weekends, and GPs on call in the evenings. Doctors were given the right of opting out of out-of-hours care in 2007, under a controversial pay deal, signed by then-Health Secretary John Reid, which awarded them a 22 per cent pay rise in 2006.

On 5 June 2007, just three weeks before he was due to take the post of Prime Minister, Brown made a speech promising &quot;British Jobs for British workers&quot;. Brown reiterated that promise at the Labour Party&#x27;s annual conference in September, which caused controversy as he coupled this with a commitment to crack down on migrant workers. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, promptly pointed out that such a commitment was illegal under EU law. Other controversial statements made by Brown about migration included him stating that English lessons and taking mandatory community service should be prerequisites for being granted UK citizenship.

During the Queen&#x27;s Speech to Parliament on 3 December 2008, the Brown government unveiled plans to introduce lie detector tests, based on voice recognition technology, in order to determine whether to accept benefit claims. Despite having spent £2.4 million on these tests, trials performed by the Department for Work and Pensions showed that they were inaccurate approximately four of every seven times they were used.

===Foreign policy===
Brown had been committed to the Iraq War, but said in a speech in June 2007 that he would &quot;learn the lessons&quot; from the mistakes made in Iraq. Brown said in a letter published on 17 March 2008 that the United Kingdom would hold an inquiry into the war.

Brown went to great lengths to empathise with those who lost family members in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. He has often said &quot;War is tragic&quot;, echoing Blair&#x27;s quote, &quot;War is horrible&quot;. Nonetheless, in November 2007 Brown was accused by some senior military figures of not adhering to the Military Covenant, a convention within British politics ensuring adequate safeguards, rewards and compensation for military personnel who risk their lives in obedience to orders derived from the policy of the elected government.

Brown did not attend the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics on 8 August 2008 in Beijing; instead, he attended the closing ceremony on 24 August 2008. Brown had been under intense pressure from human rights campaigners to send a message to China, concerning the 2008 Tibetan unrest. His decision not to attend the opening ceremony was not an act of protest, but rather was made several weeks in advance and not intended as a stand on principle.

In a speech in July 2007, Brown clarified his position regarding Britain&#x27;s relationship with the United States: &quot;We will not allow people to separate us from the United States of America in dealing with the common challenges that we face around the world. I think people have got to remember that the special relationship between a British prime minister and an American president is built on the things that we share, the same enduring values about the importance of liberty, opportunity, the dignity of the individual. I will continue to work, as Tony Blair did, very closely with the American administration.&quot;

Brown and the Labour party had pledged to allow a referendum on the EU Reform Treaty. On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon. Brown&#x27;s opponents on both sides of the House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour&#x27;s 2005 manifesto had pledged to give the British public a referendum on the original EU Constitution. Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.

===Drug policy===
During Brown&#x27;s premiership, in October 2008, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended to the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that cannabis remain classified as a Class C drug. Acting against the advice of the council, she chose to reclassify it as Class B. After Professor David Nutt, the chair of the ACMD, criticised this move in a lecture in 2009, he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary Alan Johnson. Following his resignation, Professor Nutt said Brown had &quot;made up his mind&quot; to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary. Brown had argued, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people—this is not acceptable&quot;. Professor Nutt&#x27;s predecessor at the ACMD, Sir Michael Rawlins, later said, &quot;Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view ... When that happens, then the government should explain why it&#x27;s ignoring the particular advice&quot;.

===Global recession===
Brown&#x27;s premiership coincided with the global recession, during which Brown called for fiscal action in an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand. Domestically, Brown&#x27;s administration introduced measures including a bank rescue package worth around £500 billion (approximately $850 billion), a temporary 2.5 percentage point cut in value-added tax and a &quot;car scrappage&quot; scheme.

===Challenges to leadership===
In mid-2008, Brown&#x27;s leadership was presented with a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign. This event was dubbed the &#x27;Lancashire Plot&#x27;, as two backbenchers from (pre-1974) Lancashire urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of holding on to the Labour Party leadership. Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest; however, certain prominent MPs, such as Jacqui Smith and Bill Rammell, suggested that Brown was the right person to lead Britain through its economic crisis. In the autumn, Siobhain McDonagh, an MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government, spoke of the need for discussion over Brown&#x27;s position. While she did not state that she wanted Brown deposed, she implored the Labour Party to hold a leadership election. McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterward, on 12 September. She was supported in making clear her desire for a contest by Joan Ryan (who applied, as McDonagh had, for leadership nomination papers, and became the second rebel to be fired from her job), Jim Dowd, Greg Pope, and a string of others who had previously held positions in government.

In the face of this speculation over Brown&#x27;s future, his ministers backed him to lead the party, and Harriet Harman and David Miliband denied that they were preparing leadership bids. After Labour lost the Glasgow East by-election in July, Harman, the deputy leader of the party, said that Brown was the &quot;solution&quot;, not the &quot;problem&quot;; Home Secretary Smith, Justice Secretary Jack Straw, Schools Secretary Ed Balls and Cabinet Office Minister Ed Miliband all re-affirmed their support for Brown. The Deputy Prime Minister under Blair, John Prescott, also pledged his support. Foreign Secretary David Miliband then denied that he was plotting a leadership bid, when on 30 July, an article written by him in &quot;The Guardian&quot; was interpreted by a large number in the media as an attempt to undermine Brown. In the article, Miliband outlined the party&#x27;s future, but neglected to mention the Prime Minister. Miliband, responded to this by saying that he was confident Brown could lead Labour to victory in the next general election, and that his article was an attack against the fatalism in the party since the loss of Glasgow East. Miliband continued to show his support for Brown in the face of the challenge that emerged in September, as did Business Secretary John Hutton, Environment Secretary Hilary Benn, and Chief Whip Geoff Hoon.

On 4 June 2009 James Purnell resigned from the Cabinet, and called for Brown&#x27;s resignation as prime minister.

On 6 January 2010, Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon jointly called for a secret ballot on the future of Brown&#x27;s leadership. The call received little support, and the following day Hoon said that it appeared to have failed and was &quot;over&quot;. Brown later referred to the call for a secret ballot as a &quot;form of silliness&quot;.

===By-elections and 2009 local and EU elections===

In the local elections on 1 May 2008, Labour suffered its worst results in 40 years, finishing in third place with a projected 24% share of the national vote. Subsequently, the party saw the loss of by-elections in Crewe and Nantwich and Henley as well as slumps in the polls. A by-election in Glasgow East triggered by the resignation of David Marshall saw Labour struggle to appoint a candidate, eventually settling for Margaret Curran, a sitting MSP in the Scottish Parliament. The SNP, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats all derided Labour for their disorganised nature, with Alex Salmond commenting &quot;This is their &#x27;lost weekend&#x27;—they don&#x27;t have a leader in Scotland, they don&#x27;t have a candidate in Glasgow East, and they have a prime minister who refuses to come to the constituency&quot;. Labour lost the constituency to the Scottish National Party&#x27;s John Mason who took 11,277 votes, with Labour just 365 behind. The seat experienced a swing of 22.54%.

In the European elections, Labour polled 16% of the vote, finishing in third place behind the Conservatives and UK Independence Party (UKIP). Voter apathy was reflected in the historically low turnout of around thirty-three per cent. In Scotland, voter turnout was only twenty-eight per cent. In the local elections, Labour polled 23% of the vote, finishing in third place behind Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, with Labour losing control of the four councils it had held prior to the election. In a vote widely considered to be a reaction to the expenses scandal, the share of the votes was down for all the major parties; Labour was down one per cent, the Conservative share was down five per cent. The beneficiary of the public backlash was generally seen to be the minor parties, including the Green Party and UKIP. These results were Labour&#x27;s worst since World War II. Brown was quoted in the press as having said that the results were &quot;a painful defeat for Labour&quot;, and that &quot;too many good people doing so much good for their communities and their constituencies have lost through no fault of their own.&quot;

===2010 general election===

In April 2010, Brown asked the Queen to dissolve Parliament. The general election campaign included the first televised leadership debates in Britain. The result of the election on 6 May was a hung parliament. Brown was re-elected as MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath with 29,559 votes.

===2010 government formation and resignation===

Brown announced on 10 May 2010 that he would stand down as Labour Leader, with a view to a successor being chosen before the next Labour Party Conference in September 2010. The following day, negotiations between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats to form a coalition government failed, and a Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement was reached. During the evening, Brown visited Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to Queen Elizabeth II and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, to form a government. He resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect.

==Post-premiership (2010–present)==
===Return to the backbenches (2010–2015)===

On 13 May 2010, in his first public appearance since leaving 10 Downing Street, two days after resigning as prime minister and Leader of the Labour Party, Brown confirmed he intended to stay on in Parliament, serving as a Labour backbencher, to serve the people of his Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency. He continued to serve as the MP of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath until 2015.

Towards the end of May 2010, Brown began writing &quot;Beyond the Crash&quot;, completing it after 14 weeks. The book discusses the 2007–2008 financial crisis and Brown&#x27;s recommendations for future co-ordinated global action.

He played a prominent role in the lead-up to, and the aftermath of, the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, campaigning for Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom. &quot;Our vision for the future of Scotland – yes a Scottish parliament for fairness, battling for equality across the UK&quot;, he told voters in an impassioned speech on the eve of polling. &quot;But our vision is bigger than that – at every point, particularly through our membership of the UK, to fight for what is our dream, what is our demand. A world not of a separate state, but a world of social justice people can believe in. What kind of message does Scotland send to the world if, tomorrow, we said we are going to give up on sharing, we are going to smash our partnership, we are going to abandon co-operation and we are going to throw the idea of solidarity into the dust. This is not the Scotland I know and recognise.&quot;

On 1 December 2014, Brown announced that he would not be seeking re-election to parliament. He stood down at the general election in May 2015.

===IMF speculation===

In April 2011, media reports linked Brown with the role of managing director of the International Monetary Fund following the scheduled retirement of Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Brown&#x27;s successor and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, supported Brown for the role, while the Prime Minister, David Cameron, voiced opposition to this. Following the arrest of Strauss-Kahn for alleged sexual assault in May 2011, and his subsequent resignation, these reports re-surfaced. Support for Brown among economists was mixed but British Government backing for his candidature was not forthcoming and instead supported Christine Lagarde – the eventual successful candidate – for the post.

===Other appointments===

Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who had worked with the government during Brown&#x27;s premiership to publish government data on the internet in the data.gov.uk project, subsequently invited Brown to become a board director of the World Wide Web Foundation to &quot;advise the Web Foundation on ways to involve disadvantaged communities and global leaders in the development of sustainable programs that connect humanity and affect positive change&quot;. On 22 April 2011 it was announced that Brown would be taking on an unpaid advisory role at the World Economic Forum. Brown was also appointed as the inaugural &#x27;Distinguished Leader in Residence&#x27; by New York University and took part in discussions and lectures relating to the 2007–2008 financial crisis and globalisation.

In July 2012 Brown was named by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as a United Nations Special Envoy on Global Education. He chaired the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity. The position is unpaid.

In December 2015, Brown took his first large-scale role in the private sector since standing down as prime minister in 2010, becoming an advisor to PIMCO. Any money earned from the role is to go to the Gordon and Sarah Brown Foundation to support charitable work.

On 7 November 2017, Brown released his memoir &quot;My Life, Our Times&quot;.

In September 2020, Brown was a co-author of a letter to the journal &quot;Nature&quot; highlighting the importance of EU funding in the fight against COVID-19. The letter was organised by Scientists for Labour, an organisation of which he is a patron.

On 10 June 2021 Brown released the book &quot;Seven Ways to Change the World: How To Fix The Most Pressing Problems We Face.&quot; The book features Brown&#x27;s forensic examination of seven areas where global reform and action are essential.

In September 2021, Brown was appointed as WHO Ambassador for Global Health Financing, a role that he still holds to this day.

On 5 December 2022, having led development of a Labour party blueprint on constitutional reform, Brown announced the publication of these proposals alongside future Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer. These proposals included plans for the replacement of the House of Lords with a &quot;Assembly of the Nations and Regions&quot;, electing around 200 members on a different electoral cycle to that of the House of Commons. Other measures include the &quot;strengthening of the Sewel Convention&quot; such that the ability of devolved administrations to veto UK Parliament legislation affecting devolved issues is &quot;constitutionally protected&quot;, plans to grant the Scottish Parliament greater powers over foreign affairs &quot;so that Scotland could sign up to international groups or agreements within devolved areas&quot; such as Erasmus, and plans to transfer powers to English regions and local mayors. The proposals were criticised by the SNP who described them as &quot;underwhelming&quot;, and the Speaker of the House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle who described plans to replace the Lords with an elected chamber as weakening the supremacy of the Commons. Following Labour&#x27;s landslide victory in the 2024 general election, Brown congratulated Starmer on his victory, saying: &quot;My best wishes to all the new Labour MPs and, above all, I congratulate the British people who have chosen not just change, but hope.&quot;

On 28 September 2023 Brown released the book &quot;Permacrisis: A Plan to Fix a Fractured World,&quot; which he co-wrote with Michael Spence and Mohamed A. El-Erian. In 2024 Brown co-authored a pamphlet on child poverty demanding a multibillion-pound package to solve what he dubbed &#x27;a social crisis&#x27;.

In November 2024, Brown wrote an article in opposition to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill arguing that the UK needed to improve its palliative care provision instead of legalising assisted dying.

==Personal life==

Brown&#x27;s early girlfriends included journalist Sheena McDonald and Princess Margarita, the eldest daughter of exiled King Michael of Romania. At the age of 49, Brown married Sarah Macaulay in a private ceremony at his home in North Queensferry, Fife, on 3 August 2000. A daughter, Jennifer Jane, was born prematurely on 28 December 2001; she died on 7 January 2002, one day after experiencing a brain haemorrhage. The couple have two sons, John Macaulay (born 17 October 2003) and (James) Fraser (born on 18 July 2006). In November 2006, Fraser was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. &quot;The Sun&quot; had learned of the situation in 2006 and published the story. In 2011, Brown stated he had wanted the details of his son&#x27;s condition kept private and that the publication had left him &quot;in tears&quot;. The &quot;Sun&quot; said they approached Brown and that discussion occurred with his colleagues who provided quotes to use in the article.

Sarah Brown rarely made official appearances, whether with or without her husband. She is patron of several charities and has written articles for national newspapers related to this. At the 2008 Labour Party Conference, Sarah caused surprise by taking to the stage to introduce her husband for his keynote address. After that, her public profile increased.

Brown has two brothers, John Brown and Andrew Brown. Andrew has been Head of Media Relations in the UK for the French-owned utility company EDF Energy since 2004. Brown is also the brother-in-law of environmental journalist Clare Rewcastle Brown; he wrote a piece for &quot;The Independent&quot; supporting Clare&#x27;s current environmental efforts on behalf of Sarawak.

While Prime Minister, Brown spent some of his spare time at Chequers, the house often being filled with friends. The Browns have entertained local dignitaries like Sir Leonard Figg. Brown is also a friend of Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling, who says of Brown: &quot;I know him as affable, funny and gregarious, a great listener, a kind and loyal friend.&quot;

Brown is a strong supporter of the NHS, owing partly to both the experimental surgery that saved the sight in his right eye after his retina became detached, and the care he and Sarah Brown received when their premature firstborn baby died. It has been suggested that visual difficulties have contributed to Brown&#x27;s supposed antisocial nature and awkward public manner. For example, both on a podium and before a camera, while reading &quot;he needs to look slightly to one side of the paper to focus; when speaking to an audience or into a camera lens, he must remember to correct what would normally be an automatic tendency to look slightly askew to see clearly with his good eye&quot;. Brown&#x27;s papers were prepared in capital letters and in extremely large type, resulting in his stack of papers at the dispatch box being noticeably bulky. Former staffers often attributed Brown&#x27;s outbursts of temper in Downing Street to his frustration with his visual limitations. Nevertheless, it is noted that he has never allowed these limitations to hold him back and in fact attributed the shaping of his political character to them.

Brown is a supporter of Kirkcaldy-based football club Raith Rovers and has written articles about his relationship with the club.

===Religion===
A son of a Church of Scotland minister, Brown has talked about what he calls his &quot;moral compass&quot; and of his parents being his &quot;inspiration&quot;. He has, at least ostensibly, been keen to keep his religion a private matter. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he is a member of the Church of Scotland.

== Depictions ==
&quot;The Deal&quot;, a 2003 television film, followed Tony Blair&#x27;s rise to power, and his friendship and rivalry with Brown, played by David Morrissey. In &quot;The Trial of Tony Blair&quot; (2007), Brown was played by Peter Mullan, and in the Channel 4 television film &quot;Coalition&quot; (2015), he was portrayed by Ian Grieve.

==Honours==

In March 2009, Brown was named World Statesman of the Year by the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an American organisation &#x27;dedicated to promoting peace, human rights and understanding between religious faiths&#x27;. The award was presented by Rabbi Arthur Schneier who praised Brown&#x27;s &quot;compassionate leadership in dealing with the challenging issues facing humanity, his commitment to freedom, human dignity and the environment, and for the major role he has played in helping to stabilise the world&#x27;s financial system&quot;.

Brown has, on six occasions, been honoured in the Scottish Politician of the Year awards organised by &quot;The Herald&quot; newspaper. In 1999, 2000, 2007 and 2014, he won the award in the Best Scot at Westminster category. He won the Lifetime Achievement Award/Outstanding Political Achievement category in 2011. And in 2020, he was designated &quot;best of the best&quot; in the Best Scot at Westminster category.

In the 2024 Birthday Honours, Brown was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) for public and charitable services in the UK and abroad.

<text>Galileo was an American robotic space program that studied the planet Jupiter and its moons, as well as several other Solar System bodies. Named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft consisted of an orbiter and an atmospheric entry probe. It was delivered into Earth orbit on October 18, 1989, by on the STS-34 mission, and arrived at Jupiter on December 7, 1995, after gravity assist flybys of Venus and Earth, and became the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter. The spacecraft then launched the first probe to directly measure its atmosphere. Despite suffering major antenna problems, &quot;Galileo&quot; achieved the first asteroid flyby, of 951 Gaspra, and discovered the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, around 243 Ida. In 1994, &quot;Galileo&quot; observed Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9&#x27;s collision with Jupiter.

Jupiter&#x27;s atmospheric composition and ammonia clouds were recorded, as were the volcanism and plasma interactions on Io with Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere. The data &quot;Galileo&quot; collected supported the theory of a liquid ocean under the icy surface of Europa, and there were indications of similar liquid-saltwater layers under the surfaces of Ganymede and Callisto. Ganymede was shown to possess a magnetic field and the spacecraft found new evidence for exospheres around Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. &quot;Galileo&quot; also discovered that Jupiter&#x27;s faint ring system consists of dust from impact events on the four small inner moons. The extent and structure of Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere was also mapped.

The primary mission concluded on December 7, 1997, but the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter commenced an extended mission known as the &quot;Galileo&quot; Europa Mission (GEM), which ran until December 31, 1999. By the time GEM ended, most of the spacecraft was operating well beyond its original design specifications, having absorbed three times the radiation exposure that it had been built to withstand. Many of the instruments were no longer operating at peak performance, but were still functional, so a second extension, the &quot;Galileo&quot; Millennium Mission (GMM) was authorized. On September 20, 2003, after 14 years in space and 8 years in the Jovian system, &quot;Galileo&quot; mission was terminated by sending the orbiter into Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere at a speed of over to eliminate the possibility of contaminating the moons with bacteria.

==Background==
Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, with more than twice the mass of all the other planets combined. Consideration of sending a probe to Jupiter began as early as 1959, when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed four mission concepts:
* Deep space flights would fly through interplanetary space;
* Planetary flyby missions would fly past planets close enough to collect scientific data and could visit multiple planets on a single mission;
* Orbiter missions would place a spacecraft in orbit around a planet for prolonged and detailed study;
* Atmospheric entry and lander missions would explore a planet&#x27;s atmosphere and surface.

Two missions to Jupiter, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, were approved in 1969, with NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center given responsibility for planning the missions. &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; was launched in March 1972 and passed within of Jupiter in December 1973. It was followed by &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, which was launched in April 1973, and passed within of Jupiter in December 1974, before heading on to an encounter with Saturn. They were followed by the more advanced &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft, which were launched on 5 September and 20 August 1977 respectively, and reached Jupiter in March and July 1979.

==Planning==
===Initiation===
Following the approval of the &quot;Voyager&quot; missions, NASA&#x27;s Scientific Advisory Group for Outer Solar System Missions considered the requirements for Jupiter orbiters and atmospheric probes. It noted that the technology to build a heat shield for an atmospheric probe did not yet exist, and indeed facilities to test one under the conditions found on Jupiter would not be available until 1980. There was also concern about the effects of radiation on spacecraft components, which would be better understood after &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; had conducted their flybys. &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;″s flyby in December 1973 indicated that the effects were not as severe as had been feared. NASA management designated JPL as the lead center for the Jupiter Orbiter Probe (JOP) Project. John R. Casani, who had headed the &quot;Mariner&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot; projects, became the first project manager. The JOP would be the fifth spacecraft to visit Jupiter, but the first to orbit it, and the probe the first to enter its atmosphere.

Ames and JPL decided to use a &quot;Mariner&quot; spacecraft for the Jupiter orbiter like the ones used for &quot;Voyager&quot; rather than a &quot;Pioneer&quot; spacecraft. &quot;Pioneer&quot; was stabilized by spinning the spacecraft at 60 rpm, which gave a 360-degree view of the surroundings, and did not require an attitude control system. By contrast, &quot;Mariner&quot; had an attitude control system with three gyroscopes and two sets of six nitrogen jet thrusters. Attitude was determined with reference to the Sun and Canopus, which were monitored with two primary and four secondary star tracker sensors. There was also an inertial reference unit and an accelerometer. The attitude control system allowed the spacecraft to take high-resolution images, but the functionality came at the cost of increased weight: a &quot;Mariner&quot; weighed compared to just for a &quot;Pioneer&quot;.

The increase in weight had implications. The Voyager spacecraft had been launched by Titan IIIE rockets with a &quot;Centaur&quot; upper stage, but Titan was retired afterwards. In the late 1970s, NASA was focused on the development of the reusable Space Shuttle, which was expected to make expendable rockets obsolete. In late 1975, NASA decreed that all future planetary missions would be launched by the Space Shuttle. The JOP would be the first to do so. The Space Shuttle was supposed to have the services of a space tug to launch payloads requiring something more than a low Earth orbit, but this was never approved. The United States Air Force (USAF) instead developed the solid-fueled Interim Upper Stage (IUS), later renamed the Inertial Upper Stage (with the same acronym), for the purpose.

The IUS was constructed in a modular fashion, with two stages, a large one with of propellant, and a smaller one with . This was sufficient for most satellites. It could also be configured with two large stages to launch multiple satellites. A configuration with three stages, two large and one small, would be enough for a planetary mission, so NASA contracted with Boeing for the development of a three-stage IUS. A two-stage IUS was not powerful enough to launch a payload to Jupiter without resorting to using a series of gravity-assist maneuvers around planets to garner additional speed. Most engineers regarded this solution as inelegant and planetary scientists at JPL disliked it because it meant that the mission would take months or even years longer to reach Jupiter. Longer travel times meant that the spacecraft&#x27;s components would age and possibly fail, and the onboard power supply and propellant would be depleted. Some of the gravity assist options also involved flying closer to the Sun, which would induce thermal stresses that also might cause failures.

It was estimated that the JOP would cost $634 million (equivalent to $ billion in ), and it had to compete for fiscal year 1978 funding with the Space Shuttle and the Hubble Space Telescope. A successful lobbying campaign secured funding for both JOP and Hubble over the objections of Senator William Proxmire, the chairman of the Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. The United States Congress approved funding for the Jupiter Orbiter Probe on July 19, 1977, and JOP officially commenced on October 1, 1977, the start of the fiscal year. Project manager Casani solicited suggestions for a more inspirational name for the project from people associated with it. The most votes went to &quot;Galileo&quot;, after Galileo Galilei, the first person to view Jupiter through a telescope, and the discoverer of what are now known as the Galilean moons in 1610. It was noted at the time that the name was also that of a spacecraft in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television show. In February 1978, Casani officially announced the choice of the name &quot;Galileo&quot;.

===Preparation===
To enhance reliability and reduce costs, the project engineers decided to switch from a pressurized atmospheric probe to a vented one, so the pressure inside the probe would be the same as that outside, thus extending its lifetime in Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere, but this added to its weight. Another was added in structural changes to improve reliability. This required additional fuel in the IUS, but the three-stage IUS was itself overweight with respect to its design specifications, by about . Lifting &quot;Galileo&quot; and the three-stage IUS required a special lightweight version of the Space Shuttle external tank, the Space Shuttle orbiter stripped of all non-essential equipment, and the Space Shuttle main engines (SSME) running at full power level—109 percent of their rated power level. Running at this power level necessitated the development of a more elaborate engine cooling system. Concerns were raised over whether the engines could be run at 109 percent by the launch date, so a gravity-assist maneuver using Mars was substituted for a direct flight.
Plans called for the to launch &quot;Galileo&quot; on the STS-23 mission, tentatively scheduled for sometime between January 2 and 12, 1982, this being the launch window when Earth, Mars and Jupiter were aligned to permit Mars to be used for the gravity-assist maneuver. By 1980, delays in the Space Shuttle program pushed the launch date for &quot;Galileo&quot; back to 1984. While a Mars slingshot was still possible in 1984, it would no longer be sufficient.

NASA decided to launch &quot;Galileo&quot; on two separate missions, launching the orbiter in February 1984 with the probe following a month later. The orbiter would be in orbit around Jupiter when the probe arrived, allowing the orbiter to perform its role as a relay. This configuration required a second Space Shuttle mission and a second carrier spacecraft to be built for the probe to take it to Jupiter, and was estimated to cost an additional $50 million (equivalent to $ million in ), but NASA hoped to be able to recoup some of this through competitive bidding. The problem was that while the atmospheric probe was light enough to launch with the two-stage IUS, the Jupiter orbiter was too heavy to do so, even with a gravity assist from Mars, so the three-stage IUS was still required.

By late 1980, the price tag for the IUS had risen to $506 million (equivalent to $ billion in ). The USAF could absorb this cost overrun on the development of the two-stage IUS (and indeed anticipated that it might cost far more), but NASA was faced with a quote of $179 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for the development of the three-stage version, which was $100 million (equivalent to $ million in ) more than it had budgeted for. At a press conference on January 15, 1981, Robert A. Frosch, the NASA Administrator, announced that NASA was withdrawing support for the three-stage IUS, and going with a Centaur G Prime upper stage because &quot;no other alternative upper stage is available on a reasonable schedule or with comparable costs.&quot;
Centaur provided many advantages over the IUS. The main one was that it was far more powerful. The probe and orbiter could be recombined, and the probe could be delivered directly to Jupiter in two years&#x27; flight time. The second was that, despite this, it was gentler than the IUS, because it had lower thrust. This reduced the chance of damage to the payload. Thirdly, unlike solid-fuel rockets which burned to completion once ignited, a Centaur could be switched off and on again. This gave it flexibility, which increased the chances of a successful mission, and permitted options like asteroid flybys. Centaur was proven and reliable, whereas the IUS had not yet flown. The only concern was about safety; solid-fuel rockets were considered safer than liquid-fuel ones, especially ones containing liquid hydrogen. NASA engineers estimated that additional safety features might take up to five years to develop and cost up to $100 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

In February 1981, JPL learned that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was planning major cuts to NASA&#x27;s budget, and was considering cancelling &quot;Galileo&quot;. The USAF intervened to save &quot;Galileo&quot; from cancellation. JPL had considerable experience with autonomous spacecraft that could make their own decisions. This was a necessity for deep space probes, since a signal from Earth takes from 35 to 52 minutes to reach Jupiter, depending on the relative position of the planets in their orbits. The USAF was interested in providing this capability for its satellites, so that they would be able to determine their attitude using onboard systems rather than relying on ground stations, which were not &quot;hardened&quot; against nuclear weapons, and could take independent evasive action against anti-satellite weapons. It was also interested in the manner in which JPL was designing &quot;Galileo&quot; to withstand the intense radiation of the magnetosphere of Jupiter, as this could be used to harden satellites against the electromagnetic pulse of nuclear explosions. On February 6, 1981 Strom Thurmond, the President pro tem of the Senate, wrote directly to David Stockman, the director of the OMB, arguing that &quot;Galileo&quot; was vital to the nation&#x27;s defense.
In December 1984, Casani proposed adding a flyby of asteroid 29 Amphitrite to the &quot;Galileo&quot; mission. In plotting a course to Jupiter, the engineers wanted to avoid asteroids. Little was known about them at the time, and it was suspected that they could be surrounded by dust particles. Flying through a dust cloud could damage the spacecraft&#x27;s optics and possibly other parts of the spacecraft as well. To be safe, JPL wanted to avoid asteroids by at least . Most of the asteroids in the vicinity of the flight path like 1219 Britta and 1972 Yi Xing were only a few kilometers in diameter and promised little scientific value when observed from a safe distance, but 29 Amphitrite was one of the largest, and a flyby at even could have great value. The flyby would delay the spacecraft&#x27;s arrival in Jupiter orbit from August 29 to December 10, 1988, and the expenditure of propellant would reduce the number of orbits of Jupiter from eleven to ten. This was expected to add $20 to $25 million (equivalent to $ to $ million in ) to the cost of the &quot;Galileo&quot; project. The 29 Amphitrite flyby was approved by NASA Administrator James M. Beggs on December 6, 1984.

During testing, contamination was discovered in the system of metal slip rings and brushes used to transmit electrical signals around the spacecraft, and they were returned to be refabricated. The problem was traced back to a chlorofluorocarbon used to clean parts after soldering. It had been absorbed, and was then released in a vacuum environment. It mixed with debris generated as the brushes wore down, and caused intermittent problems with electrical signal transmission. Problems were also detected in the performance of memory devices in an electromagnetic radiation environment. The components were replaced, but then a read disturb problem arose, in which reads from one memory location disturbed the contents of adjacent locations. This was found to have been caused by the changes made to make the components less sensitive to electromagnetic radiation. Each component had to be removed, retested, and replaced. All of the spacecraft components and spare parts received a minimum of 2,000 hours of testing. The spacecraft was expected to last for at least five years—long enough to reach Jupiter and perform its mission. On December 19, 1985, it departed JPL in Pasadena, California, on the first leg of its journey, a road trip to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The &quot;Galileo&quot; mission was scheduled for STS-61-G on May 20, 1986, using .

===Spacecraft===

JPL built the Galileo spacecraft and managed the Galileo program for NASA, but West Germany&#x27;s Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm supplied the propulsion module, and Ames managed the atmospheric probe, which was built by the Hughes Aircraft Company. At launch, the orbiter and probe together had a mass of and stood tall. There were twelve experiments on the orbiter and seven on the atmospheric probe. The orbiter was powered by a pair of general-purpose heat source radioisotope thermoelectric generators (GPHS-RTGs) fueled by plutonium-238 that generated 570 watts at launch. The atmospheric probe had a lithium–sulfur battery rated at 730 watt-hours.

Probe instruments included sensors for measuring atmospheric temperature and pressure. There was a mass spectrometer and a helium-abundance detector to study atmospheric composition, and a whistler detector for measurements of lightning activity and Jupiter&#x27;s radiation belt. There were magnetometer sensors, a plasma-wave detector, a high-energy particle detector, a cosmic and Jovian dust detector, and a heavy ion counter. There was a near-infrared mapping spectrometer for multispectral images for atmospheric and moon surface chemical analysis, and an ultraviolet spectrometer to study gases.

===Reconsideration===
On January 28, 1986, lifted off on the STS-51-L mission. A failure of the solid rocket booster 73 seconds into flight tore the spacecraft apart, resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members. The Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster was America&#x27;s worst space disaster up to that time. The immediate impact on the &quot;Galileo&quot; project was that the May launch date could not be met because the Space Shuttles were grounded while the cause of the disaster was investigated. When they did fly again, &quot;Galileo&quot; would have to compete with high-priority Department of Defense launches, the tracking and data relay satellite system, and the Hubble Space Telescope. By April 1986, it was expected that the Space Shuttles would not fly again before July 1987 at the earliest, and &quot;Galileo&quot; could not be launched before December 1987.
The Rogers Commission into the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster handed down its report on June 6, 1986. It was critical of NASA&#x27;s safety protocols and risk management. In particular, it noted the hazards of a Centaur-G stage. On June 19, 1986, NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher canceled the Shuttle-Centaur project. This was only partly due to the NASA management&#x27;s increased aversion to risk in the wake of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster; NASA management also considered the money and manpower required to get the Space Shuttle flying again, and decided that there were insufficient resources to resolve lingering issues with Shuttle-Centaur as well. The changes to the Space Shuttle proved more extensive than anticipated, and in April 1987, JPL was informed that &quot;Galileo&quot; could not be launched before October 1989. The &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft was shipped back to JPL.

Without Centaur, it looked like there was no means of getting &quot;Galileo&quot; to Jupiter. For a time, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; science reporter Usha Lee McFarling noted, &quot;it looked like &quot;Galileo&quot;″s only trip would be to the Smithsonian Institution.&quot; The cost of keeping it ready to fly in space was reckoned at $40 to $50 million per year (equivalent to $ to $ million in ), and the estimated cost of the whole project had blown out to $1.4 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ).

At JPL, the &quot;Galileo&quot; Mission Design Manager and Navigation Team Chief, Robert Mitchell, assembled a team that consisted of Dennis Byrnes, Louis D&#x27;Amario, Roger Diehl and himself, to see if they could find a trajectory that would get &quot;Galileo&quot; to Jupiter using only a two-stage IUS. Roger Diehl came up with the idea of using a series of gravity assists to provide the additional velocity required to reach Jupiter. This would require &quot;Galileo&quot; to fly past Venus, and then past Earth twice. This was referred to as the Venus-Earth-Earth Gravity Assist (VEEGA) trajectory.
The reason no one had considered the VEEGA trajectory before was that the second encounter with Earth would not give the spacecraft any extra energy. Diehl realised that this was not necessary; the second encounter would merely change its direction to put it on a course for Jupiter. In addition to increasing the flight time, the VEEGA trajectory had another drawback from the point of view of NASA Deep Space Network (DSN): &quot;Galileo&quot; would arrive at Jupiter when it was at the maximum range from Earth, and maximum range meant minimum signal strength. It would have a declination of 23 degrees south instead of 18 degrees north, so the tracking station would be the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex in Australia, with its two 34-meter and one 70-meter antennae. A northerly declination could have been supported by two sites, at Goldstone and Madrid. The Canberra antennae were supplemented by the 64-meter antenna at the Parkes Observatory.

Initially it was thought that the VEEGA trajectory demanded a November launch, but D&#x27;Amario and Byrnes calculated that a mid-course correction between Venus and Earth would permit an October launch as well. Taking such a roundabout route meant that &quot;Galileo&quot; would require sixty months to reach Jupiter instead of just thirty, but it would get there. Consideration was given to using the USAF&#x27;s Titan IV launch system with its Centaur G Prime upper stage. This was retained as a backup for a time, but in November 1988 the USAF informed NASA that it could not provide a Titan IV in time for the May 1991 launch opportunity, owing to the backlog of high priority Department of Defense missions. However, the USAF supplied IUS-19, which had originally been earmarked for a Department of Defense mission, for use by the &quot;Galileo&quot; mission.

===Nuclear concerns===
As the launch date of &quot;Galileo&quot; neared, anti-nuclear groups, concerned over what they perceived as an unacceptable risk to the public&#x27;s safety from the plutonium in &quot;Galileo&quot;″s GPHS-RTG modules, sought a court injunction prohibiting &quot;Galileo&quot; launch. RTGs were necessary for deep space probes because they had to fly distances from the Sun that made the use of solar energy impractical. They had been used for years in planetary exploration without mishap: the Department of Defense&#x27;s Lincoln Experimental Satellites 8/9 had 7 percent more plutonium on board than &quot;Galileo&quot;, and the two &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft each carried 80 percent of &quot;Galileo&quot; load of plutonium. By 1989, plutonium had been used in 22 spacecraft.

Activists remembered the crash of the Soviet Union&#x27;s nuclear-powered Kosmos 954 satellite in Canada in 1978, and the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, while it did not involve nuclear fuel, raised public awareness about spacecraft failures. No RTGs had ever done a non-orbital swing past the Earth at close range and high speed, as &quot;Galileo&quot; VEEGA trajectory required it to do. This created the possibility of a mission failure in which Galileo struck Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and dispersed plutonium. Planetary scientist Carl Sagan, a strong supporter of the &quot;Galileo&quot; mission, wrote that &quot;there is nothing absurd about either side of this argument.&quot;

Before the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, JPL had conducted shock tests on the RTGs that indicated that they could withstand a pressure of without a failure, which would have been sufficient to withstand an explosion on the launch pad. The possibility of adding additional shielding was considered but rejected, mainly because it would add an unacceptable amount of extra weight. After the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, NASA commissioned a study on the possible effects if such an event occurred with &quot;Galileo&quot; on board. Angus McRonald, a JPL engineer, concluded that what would happen would depend on the altitude at which the Space Shuttle broke up. If the &quot;Galileo&quot;/IUS combination fell free from the orbiter at , the RTGs would fall to Earth without melting, and drop into the Atlantic Ocean about from the Florida coast. On the other hand, if the orbiter broke up at an altitude of it would be traveling at and the RTG cases and GPHS modules would melt before falling into the Atlantic off the Florida coast.

NASA concluded that the chance of a disaster was 1 in 2,500, although anti-nuclear groups thought it might be as high as 1 in 430. NASA assessed the risk to an individual at 1 in 100 million, about two orders of magnitude less than the danger of being killed by lightning. The prospect of an inadvertent re-entry into the atmosphere during the VEEGA maneuvers was reckoned at less than 1 in 2 million, but an accident might have released a maximum of . This could result in up to 9 fatalities from cancer per 10 million exposed people.

==Launch==
STS-34 was the mission designated to launch &quot;Galileo&quot;, scheduled for October 12, 1989, in the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. The spacecraft was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center by a high-speed truck convoy that departed JPL in the middle of the night. There were fears that the trucks might be hijacked by anti-nuclear activists or terrorists after the plutonium, so the route was kept secret from the drivers beforehand, and they drove through the night and the following day and only stopped for food and fuel.

Last-minute efforts by three environmental groups (the Christic Institute, the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice and the Foundation on Economic Trends) to halt the launch were rejected by the District of Columbia Circuit on technical grounds rather than the merits of the case, but in a concurring opinion, Chief Justice Patricia Wald wrote that while the legal challenge was not frivolous, there was no evidence of the plaintiffs&#x27; claim that NASA had acted improperly in compiling the mission&#x27;s environmental assessment. On October 16, eight protesters were arrested for trespassing at the Kennedy Space Center; three were jailed and the remaining five released. Federal judge Oliver Gasch ruled on October 21 that the launch was in the public interest, as canceling it would cost the public $164 million and increased knowledge of the Solar system.

The launch was twice delayed; first by a faulty main engine controller that forced a postponement to October 17, and then by inclement weather, which necessitated a postponement to the following day, but this was not a concern since the launch window extended until November 21. &quot;Atlantis&quot; finally lifted off at 16:53:40 UTC on October 18, and went into a orbit. &quot;Galileo&quot; was successfully deployed at 00:15 UTC on October 19. Following the IUS burn, the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft adopted its configuration for solo flight, and separated from the IUS at 01:06:53 UTC on October 19. The launch was perfect, and &quot;Galileo&quot; was soon headed towards Venus at over . &quot;Atlantis&quot; returned to Earth safely on October 23.

==Venus encounter==
The encounter with Venus on February 9 was in view of the DSN&#x27;s Canberra and Madrid Deep Space Communications Complexes. &quot;Galileo&quot;″s closest approach to Venus came at 05:58:48 UTC on February 10, 1990, at a range of . Due to the Doppler effect, the spacecraft&#x27;s velocity relative to Earth could be computed by measuring the change in carrier frequency of the spacecraft&#x27;s transmission compared to the nominal frequency. Doppler data collected by the DSN allowed JPL to verify that the gravity-assist maneuver had been successful, and the spacecraft had obtained the expected increase in speed. Unfortunately, three hours into the flyby, the tracking station at Goldstone had to be shut down due to high winds, and Doppler data was lost.
Because Venus was much closer to the Sun than the spacecraft had been designed to operate, great care was taken to avoid thermal damage. In particular, the X-band high gain antenna (HGA) was not deployed, but was kept folded up like an umbrella and pointed away from the Sun to keep it shaded and cool. This meant that the two small S-band low-gain antennae (LGAs) had to be used instead. They had a maximum bandwidth of 1,200 bits per second (bit/s) compared to the 134,000 bit/s expected from the HGA. As the spacecraft moved further from Earth, reception necessitated the use of the DSN&#x27;s 70-meter dishes, to the detriment of other users, who had lower priority than &quot;Galileo&quot;. Even so, the downlink telemetry rate fell to 40 bit/s within a few days of the Venus flyby, and by March it was down to just 10 bit/s.

Venus had been the focus of many automated flybys, probes, balloons and landers, most recently the 1989 &quot;Magellan&quot; spacecraft, and &quot;Galileo&quot; had not been designed with Venus in mind. Nonetheless, there were useful observations that it could make, as it carried some instruments that had never flown on spacecraft to Venus, such as the near-infrared mapping spectrometer (NIMS). Telescopic observations of Venus had revealed that there were certain parts of the infrared spectrum that the greenhouse gases in the Venusian atmosphere did not block, making them transparent on these wavelengths. This permitted the NIMS to both view the clouds and obtain maps of the equatorial- and mid-latitudes of the night side of Venus with three to six times the resolution of Earth-based telescopes. The ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS) was also deployed to observe the Venusian clouds and their motions.

Another set of observations was conducted using Galileo&#x27;s energetic-particles detector (EPD) when &quot;Galileo&quot; moved through the bow shock caused by Venus&#x27;s interaction with the solar wind. Earth&#x27;s magnetic field causes the bow shock to occur at around from its center, but Venus&#x27;s weak magnetic field causes it to occur nearly on the surface, so the solar wind interacts with the atmosphere. A search for lightning on Venus was conducted using the plasma-wave detector, which noted nine bursts likely to have been caused by lightning, but efforts to capture an image of lightning with the solid-state imaging system (SSI) were unsuccessful.
==Earth encounters==
===Flybys===
&quot;Galileo&quot; made two course corrections on April 9 to 12 and May 11 to 12, 1990, to alter its velocity by . The spacecraft flew by Earth twice; the first time at a range of at 20:34:34 UTC on December 8, 1990. This was higher than predicted, and the time of the closest approach was within a second of the prediction. It was the first time that a deep space probe had returned to Earth from interplanetary space. A second flyby of Earth was at at 15:09:25 UTC on December 8, 1992. This time the spacecraft passed within a kilometer of its aiming point over the South Atlantic. This was so accurate that a scheduled course correction was cancelled, thereby saving of propellant.

===Earth&#x27;s bow shock and the solar wind===

The Earth encounters provided an opportunity for a series of experiments. A study of Earth&#x27;s bow shock was conducted as &quot;Galileo&quot; passed by Earth&#x27;s day side. The solar wind travels at and is deflected by Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, creating a magnetic tail on Earth&#x27;s dark side over a thousand times the radius of the planet. Observations were made by &quot;Galileo&quot; when it passed through the magnetic tail on Earth&#x27;s dark side at a distance of from the planet. The magnetosphere was quite active at the time, and &quot;Galileo&quot; detected magnetic storms and whistlers caused by lightning strikes.

The NIMS was employed to look for mesospheric clouds, which were thought to be caused by methane released by industrial processes. The water vapor in the clouds breaks down the ozone in the upper atmosphere. Normally the clouds are only seen in September or October, but &quot;Galileo&quot; was able to detect them in December, an indication of possible damage to Earth&#x27;s ozone layer.

===Remote detection of life on Earth===
Carl Sagan, pondering the question of whether life on Earth could be easily detected from space, devised a set of experiments in the late 1980s using &quot;Galileo&quot; remote sensing instruments during the mission&#x27;s first Earth flyby in December 1990. After data acquisition and processing, Sagan published a paper in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1993 detailing the results of the experiment. &quot;Galileo&quot; had indeed found what are now referred to as the &quot;Sagan criteria for life&quot;. These included strong absorption of light at the red end of the visible spectrum (especially over continents) by chlorophyll in photosynthesizing plants; absorption bands of molecular oxygen as a result of plant activity; infrared bands caused by the approximately 1 micromole per mole of methane (a gas which must be replenished by volcanic or biological activity) in the atmosphere; and modulated narrowband radio wave transmissions uncharacteristic of any known natural source. &quot;Galileo&quot; experiments were thus the first ever scientific controls in the newborn science of astrobiological remote sensing.

===Lunar observations===
En route to &quot;Galileo&quot; second gravity-assist flyby of Earth, the spacecraft flew over the lunar north pole on December 8, 1992, at an altitude of . The north pole had been photographed before, by &quot;Mariner 10&quot; in 1973, but &quot;Galileo&quot; cameras, with their per pixel imagery, provided new information about a region that still held some scientific mysteries. The infrared spectromer surveyed the surface minerals and revealed that the region was more minerallogically diverse than expected. There was evidence that the Moon had been volcanically active earlier than originally thought, and the spectrometer clearly distinguished different lava flows on the Mare Serenitatis. Areas where titanium-rich material had been blasted from vents, like the one sampled by Apollo 17, showed up clearly.

===&quot;Galileo&quot; Optical Experiment===
During the second Earth flyby, another experiment was performed. Optical communications in space were assessed by detecting light pulses from powerful lasers with &quot;Galileo&quot; CCD. The experiment, dubbed &quot;Galileo&quot; Optical Experiment or GOPEX, used two separate sites to beam laser pulses to the spacecraft, one at Table Mountain Observatory in California and the other at the Starfire Optical Range in New Mexico. The Table Mountain site used a operating at a frequency-doubled wavelength of 532 nm, with a repetition rate of 15 to 30 Hertz and a pulse power full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the tens of megawatts range, which was coupled to a Cassegrain reflector telescope for transmission to &quot;Galileo&quot;. The Starfire range site used a similar setup with a larger transmitting telescope. Long-exposure (~0.1 to 0.8 s) images using &quot;Galileo&quot; 560 nm centered green filter produced images of Earth clearly showing the laser pulses even at distances of up to .

Adverse weather conditions, restrictions placed on laser transmissions by the U.S. Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) and a pointing error caused by the scan platform on the spacecraft not being able to change direction and speed as quickly as expected (which prevented laser detection on all frames with less than 400 ms exposure times) contributed to a reduction in the number of successful detections of the laser transmission to 48 of the total 159 frames taken. Nonetheless, the experiment was considered a resounding success and the data acquired were used to design laser downlinks to send large volumes of data very quickly from spacecraft to Earth. The scheme was studied in 2004 for a data link to a future Mars-orbiting spacecraft. On December 5, 2023, NASA&#x27;s Deep Space Optical Communications experiment on the &quot;Psyche&quot; spacecraft used infrared lasers for two-way communication between Earth and the spacecraft.

==High-gain antenna problem==

Once &quot;Galileo&quot; headed beyond Earth, it was no longer risky to employ the , so on April 11, 1991, &quot;Galileo&quot; was ordered to unfurl it. This was done using two small dual drive actuator (DDA) motors to drive a worm gear, and was expected to take 165 seconds, or 330 seconds if one actuator failed. The antenna had 18 graphite-epoxy ribs; when the driver motor started and put pressure on the ribs, they were supposed to pop out of the cup their tips were held in, and the antenna would unfold like an umbrella. When it reached the fully deployed configuration, redundant microswitches would shut down the motors. Otherwise they would run for eight minutes before being automatically shut down to prevent them from overheating.

Through telemetry from &quot;Galileo&quot;, investigators determined that the electric motors had stalled at 56 seconds. The spacecraft&#x27;s spin rate had decreased due to an increase in its moment of inertia and its wobble increased, indicative of an asymmetric unfolding. Only 15 ribs had popped out, leaving the antenna looking like a lop-sided, half-open umbrella. It was not possible to re-fold the antenna and try the opening sequence again; although the motors were capable of running in reverse, the antenna was not designed for this, and human assistance was required when it was done on Earth to ensure that the wire mesh did not snag.

The first thing the &quot;Galileo&quot; team tried was to rotate the spacecraft away from the Sun and back again on the assumption that the problem was with friction holding the pins in their sockets. If so, then heating and cooling the ribs might cause them to pop out of their sockets. This was done seven times, but with no result. They then tried swinging LGA-2 (which faced in the opposite direction to the HGA and LGA-1) 145 degrees to a hard stop, thereby shaking the spacecraft. This was done six times with no effect. Finally, they tried shaking the antenna by pulsing the DDA motors at 1.25 and 1.875 Hertz. This increased the torque by up to 40 percent. The motors were pulsed 13,000 times over a three-week period in December 1992 and January 1993, but only managed to move the ballscrew by one and a half revolutions beyond the stall point.
Investigators concluded that during the 4.5 years that &quot;Galileo&quot; spent in storage after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, the lubricants between the tips of the ribs and the cup were eroded. They were then worn down by vibration during the three cross-country journeys by truck between California and Florida for the spacecraft. The failed ribs were those closest to the flat-bed trailers carrying &quot;Galileo&quot; on these trips. The use of land transport was partly to save costs—air transport would have cost an additional $65,000 () or so per trip—but also to reduce the amount of handling required in loading and unloading the aircraft, which was considered a major risk of damage. The spacecraft was also subjected to severe vibration in a vacuum environment by the IUS. Experiments on Earth with the test HGA showed that having a set of stuck ribs all on one side reduced the DDA torque produced by up to 40 percent.

The antenna lubricants were applied only once, nearly a decade before launch. Furthermore, the HGA was not subjected to the usual rigorous testing, because there was no backup unit that could be installed in &quot;Galileo&quot; in case of damage. The flight-ready HGA was never given a thermal evaluation test, and was unfurled only a half dozen or so times before the mission. Testing might not have revealed the problem in any case; the Lewis Research Center was never able to replicate the problem on Earth, and it was assumed to be the combination of loss of lubricant during transportation, vibration during launch by the IUS, and a prolonged period of time in the vacuum of space where bare metal touching could undergo cold welding. Whatever the cause, the HGA was rendered useless.

The two LGAs were capable of transmitting information back to Earth, but since it transmitted its signal over a cone with a 120-degree half-angle, allowing it to communicate even when not pointed at Earth, its bandwidth was significantly less than that of the HGA would have been, as the HGA transmitted over a half-angle of one-sixth of a degree. The HGA was to have transmitted at 134 kilobits per second, whereas LGA-1 was only intended to transmit at about 8 to 16 bits per second. LGA-1 transmitted with a power of about 15 to 20 watts, which by the time it reached Earth and had been collected by one of the large aperture 70-meter DSN antennas, had a total power of about 1020 watts. The change to mission plan required a series of software changes to be uploaded.

Image data collected was buffered and collected in &quot;Galileo&quot;″s Command and Data Subsystem (CDS) memory. This represented 192 kilobytes of the 384 kilobyte CDS storage, and had been added late, out of concern that the 6504 Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) memory devices might not be reliable during a mission. As it happened, they gave no trouble, but the CDS memory could store up to 31 minutes of data from the Radio Relay Hardware (RRH) channels. To conserve bandwidth, data-compression software was implemented. Image compression used an integer approximation of the discrete cosine transform, while other data were compressed with variant of the Lempel–Ziv–Welch algorithm. Using compression, the arraying of several Deep Space Network antennas, and sensitivity upgrades to the receivers used to listen to &quot;Galileo&quot; signal, data throughput was increased to a maximum of 160 bits per second. By further using data compression, the effective bandwidth could be raised to 1,000 bits per second.

The data collected on Jupiter and its moons were stored in the spacecraft&#x27;s onboard tape recorder, and transmitted back to Earth during the long apoapsis portion of the probe&#x27;s orbit using the low-gain antenna. At the same time, measurements were made of Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere and transmitted back to Earth. The reduction in available bandwidth reduced the total amount of data transmitted throughout the mission, but William J. O&#x27;Neil, &quot;Galileo&quot; project manager from 1992 to 1997, expressed confidence that 70 percent of &quot;Galileo&quot; science goals could still be met. The decision to use magnetic tape for storage was a conservative one, taken in the late 1970s when the use of tape was common. Conservatism was not restricted to engineers; a 1980 suggestion that the results of &quot;Galileo&quot; could be distributed electronically instead of on paper was regarded as ridiculous by geologists, on the grounds that storage would be prohibitively expensive; some of them thought that taking measurements on a computer involved putting a wooden ruler up to the screen.

==Asteroid encounters==
===951 Gaspra===

Two months after entering the asteroid belt, &quot;Galileo&quot; performed the first asteroid encounter by a spacecraft. &quot;Galileo&quot; passed 951 Gaspra, an S-type asteroid, at a distance of at 22:37 UTC on October 29, 1991, at a relative speed of about . Fifty-seven images of Gaspra were taken with the SSI, covering about 80 percent of the asteroid. Without the HGA, the bit rate was only about 40 bit/s, so an image took up to 60 hours to transmit back to Earth. The &quot;Galileo&quot; project was able to secure 80 hours of Canberra&#x27;s 70-meter dish time between 7 and 14 November 1991, but most of images taken, including low-resolution images of more of the surface, were not transmitted to Earth until November 1992.

The imagery revealed a cratered and irregular body, measuring about . Its shape was not remarkable for an asteroid of its size. Measurements were taken using the NIMS to indicate the asteroid&#x27;s composition and physical properties. While Gaspra has plenty of small craters—over 600 of them ranging in size from —it lacks large ones, hinting at a relatively recent origin, although it is possible that some of the depressions were eroded craters. Several relatively flat planar areas were found, suggesting that Gaspra was formed from another body by a collision. Measurements of the solar wind in the vicinity of the asteroid showed it changing direction a few hundred kilometers from Gaspra, which hinted that Gaspra might have a magnetic field, but this was not certain.

===243 Ida and Dactyl===

Following the second Earth encounter, &quot;Galileo&quot; performed close observations of another asteroid, 243 Ida. A slight trajectory correction was made to enable this on August 26, 1993. With four hours to go before the encounter with Ida, &quot;Galileo&quot; spontaneously abandoned the observation configuration and resumed its cruise configuration. Engineers were able to correct the problem and have the instruments ready by 16:52:04 UTC on August 28, 1993, when &quot;Galileo&quot; flew past Ida at a range of . High-resolution images were taken to create a color mosaic of one side of the asteroid, with the highest resolution image taken at a range of . Measurements were taken using SSI and NIMS.
Transmission was still limited to the 40 bit/s data rate available during the Gaspra flyby. At that rate, it took thirty hours to send each of the five frames. In September, the line of sight between &quot;Galileo&quot; and Earth was close to the Sun, so there was only time to send one mosaic before it was blocked by the Sun on September 29, 1993; the rest of the mosaics were transmitted in February and March, after Earth had come around the Sun. &quot;Galileo&quot; tape recorder was used to store the images, but tape space was also required for the primary Jupiter mission. A technique was developed whereby only image fragments of two or three lines out of every 330 were initially sent. A determination could then be made as to whether the image was of 243 Ida or of empty space. Ultimately, only about 16 percent of the SSI data recorded could be sent back to Earth.

When astronomer Ann Harch examined the images on February 17, 1994, she found that Ida had a small moon measuring around in diameter, which appeared in 47 images. A competition was held among &quot;Galileo&quot; project members to select a name for the moon, which was ultimately dubbed Dactyl after the legendary Dactyls, mythical beings which lived on Mount Ida, the geographical feature on Crete the asteroid was named for. Craters on Dactyl were named after individual dactyloi. Regions on 243 Ida were named after cities where Johann Palisa, the discover of 243 Ida, made his observations, while ridges on 243 Ida were named in honor of deceased &quot;Galileo&quot; team members.

Dactyl was the first asteroid moon to be discovered. Moons of asteroids had been assumed to be rare, but the discovery of Dactyl hinted that they might in fact be quite common. From subsequent analysis of this data, Dactyl appeared to be an S-type asteroid, and spectrally different from 243 Ida, although Ida is also an S-type asteroid. It was hypothesized that both may have been produced by the breakup of a Koronis parent body.

==Voyage to Jupiter==
=== Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 ===
&quot;Galileo&quot; prime mission was a two-year study of the Jovian system, but on March 26, 1993, while it was en route, astronomers Carolyn S. Shoemaker, Eugene M. Shoemaker and David H. Levy discovered fragments of a comet orbiting Jupiter, the remains of a comet that had passed within Jupiter&#x27;s Roche limit and had been torn apart by tidal forces. It was named Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9. Calculations indicated that it would crash into the planet sometime between July 16 and 24, 1994. Although &quot;Galileo&quot; was still away, Jupiter was 66 pixels wide in its camera, and it was perfectly positioned to observe this event. Terrestrial telescopes had to wait to see the impact event sites as they rotated into view because it would occur on Jupiter&#x27;s night side.

Instead of burning up in Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere as expected, the first of the 21 comet fragments struck the planet at around and exploded with a fireball high, easily discernible to Earth-based telescopes even though it was on the night side of the planet. The impact left a series of dark scars on the planet, some two or three times as large as the Earth, that persisted for weeks. When &quot;Galileo&quot; observed an impact in ultraviolet light, the fireballs lasted for about ten seconds, but in the infrared they persisted for 90 seconds or more. When a fragment hit the planet, it increased Jupiter&#x27;s overall brightness by about 20 percent. The NIMS observed one fragment create a fireball in diameter that burned with a temperature of , which was hotter than the surface of the Sun.

===Probe deployment===
The &quot;Galileo&quot; probe separated from the orbiter at 03:07 UTC on July 13, 1995, five months before its rendezvous with the planet on December 7. At this point, the spacecraft was from Jupiter, but from Earth, and telemetry from the spacecraft, transmitted at the speed of light, took 37 minutes to reach JPL. A tiny frequency change in the radio signal indicated that the separation had been accomplished. The &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter was still on a collision course with Jupiter. Previously, course corrections had been made using the twelve thrusters, but with the probe on its way, the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter could now fire its Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm main engine which had been covered by the probe until then. At 07:38 UTC on July 27, it was fired for the first time to place the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter on course to enter orbit around Jupiter, whence it would act as a communications relay for the &quot;Galileo&quot; probe. The &quot;Galileo&quot; probe&#x27;s project manager, Marcie Smith at the Ames Research Center, was confident that the LGAs could be used as relays. The burn lasted for five minutes and eight seconds, and changed the velocity of the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter by .

===Dust storms===
In August 1995, the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter encountered a severe dust storm from Jupiter that took several months to traverse. Normally the spacecraft&#x27;s dust detector picked up a dust particle every three days; now it detected up to 20,000 particles a day. Interplanetary dust storms had previously been encountered by the &quot;Ulysses&quot; probe, which had passed by Jupiter three years before on its mission to study the Sun&#x27;s polar regions, but those encountered by &quot;Galileo&quot; were more intense. The dust particles were 5 to 10 nm in size, about the same as those in cigarette smoke, and had speeds ranging from depending on their size. The existence of the dust storms had come as a complete surprise to scientists when &quot;Ulysses&quot; encountered them. While data from both &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Galileo&quot; hinted that they originated somewhere in the Jovian system, it was a mystery how they had been created and how they had escaped from Jupiter&#x27;s strong gravitational and electromagnetic fields.

===Tape recorder anomaly===
The failure of &quot;Galileo&quot; high-gain antenna meant that data storage to the tape recorder for later compression and playback was crucial in order to obtain any substantial information from the flybys of Jupiter and its moons. The four-track, 114-megabyte digital tape recorder was manufactured by Odetics Corporation. On October 11, it was stuck in rewind mode for 15 hours before engineers learned what had happened and were able to send commands to shut it off. Although the recorder itself was still in working order, the malfunction had possibly damaged a length of tape at the end of the reel. This section of tape was declared &quot;off limits&quot; to any future data recording, and was covered with 25 more turns of tape to secure the section and reduce any further stresses, which could tear it. Because it happened only weeks before &quot;Galileo&quot; entered orbit around Jupiter, the anomaly prompted engineers to sacrifice data acquisition of almost all of the Io and Europa observations during the orbit insertion phase in order to focus on recording data sent from the atmospheric probe during its descent.

==Jupiter==

===Arrival===
The &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter&#x27;s magnetometers reported that the spacecraft had encountered the bow shock of Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere on November 16, 1995, when it was from Jupiter. The bow shock moved to and fro in response to solar wind gusts, and was therefore crossed multiple times between 16 and 26 November, by which time &quot;Galileo&quot; was from Jupiter.

On December 7, 1995, the orbiter arrived in the Jovian system. That day it made a flyby of Europa at 11:09 UTC, and then an flyby of Io at 15:46 UTC, using Io&#x27;s gravity to reduce its speed, and thereby conserve propellant for use later in the mission. At 19:54 it made its closest approach to Jupiter. The orbiter&#x27;s electronics had been heavily shielded against radiation, but the radiation surpassed expectations, and nearly exceeded the spacecraft&#x27;s design limits. One of the navigational systems failed, but the backup took over. Most robotic spacecraft respond to failures by entering safe mode and awaiting further instructions from Earth, but this was not possible for &quot;Galileo&quot; during the arrival sequence due to the great distance and consequent long turnaround time.

===Atmospheric probe===

The descent probe awoke in response to an alarm at 16:00 UTC and began powering up its instruments. It passed through the rings of Jupiter and encountered a previously undiscovered radiation belt ten times as strong as Earth&#x27;s Van Allen radiation belt above Jupiter&#x27;s cloud tops. It had been predicted that the probe would pass through three layers of clouds; an upper one consisting of ammonia-ice particles at a pressure of ; a middle one of ammonium hydrosulfide ice particles at a pressure of ; and one of water vapor at . The atmosphere through which the probe descended was much denser and hotter than expected. Jupiter was also found to have only half the amount of helium expected and the data did not support the three-layered cloud structure theory: only one significant cloud layer was measured by the probe, at a pressure of around but with many indications of smaller areas of increased particle densities along the whole length of its trajectory.

The descent probe entered Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere, defined for the purpose as being above the pressure level, without any braking at 22:04 UTC on December 7, 1995. At this point it was moving at relative to Jupiter. This was by far the most difficult atmospheric entry yet attempted by any spacecraft; the probe had to withstand a peak deceleration of . The rapid flight through the atmosphere produced a plasma with a temperature of about , and the probe&#x27;s carbon phenolic heat shield lost more than half of its mass, , during the descent. As the probe passed through Jupiter&#x27;s cloud tops, it started transmitting data to the orbiter, above. The data was not immediately relayed to Earth, but a single bit was transmitted from the orbiter as a notification that the signal from the probe was being received and recorded, which would then take days to be transmitted using the LGA.

The atmospheric probe deployed its parachute fifty-three seconds later than anticipated, resulting in a small loss of upper-atmospheric readings. This was attributed to wiring problems with an accelerometer that determined when to begin the parachute deployment sequence. The probe then dropped its heat shield, which fell into Jupiter&#x27;s interior. The parachute reduced the probe&#x27;s speed to . The signal from the probe was no longer detected by the orbiter after 61.4 minutes, at an elevation of below the cloud tops and a pressure of . It was believed that the probe continued to fall at terminal velocity, as the temperature increased to and the pressure to , destroying it.

The probe detected less lightning, less water, but stronger winds than expected. Scientists had expected to find wind speeds of up to , but winds of up to were detected. The implication was that the winds are not produced by heat generated by sunlight (as Jupiter gets less sunlight than Earth) or the condensation of water vapor (the main causes on Earth), but are due to an internal heat source. It was already well known that the atmosphere of Jupiter was mainly composed of hydrogen, but the clouds of ammonia and ammonium sulfide were much thinner than expected, and clouds of water vapor were not detected. This was the first observation of ammonia clouds in another planet&#x27;s atmosphere. The atmosphere creates ammonia-ice particles from material coming up from lower depths.

The atmosphere was more turbulent than expected. Wind speeds in the outermost layers were , in agreement with previous measurements from afar, but those wind speeds increased dramatically at pressure levels of , then remaining consistently high at around . The abundance of nitrogen, carbon and sulfur was three times that of the Sun, raising the possibility that they had been acquired from other bodies in the Solar system, but the low abundance of water cast doubt on theories that Earth&#x27;s water had been acquired from comets.

There was far less lightning activity than expected, only about a tenth of the level of activity on Earth, but this was consistent with the lack of water vapor. More surprising was the high abundance of noble gases (argon, krypton and xenon), with abundances up to three times that found in the Sun. For Jupiter to trap these gases, it would have had to be much colder than today, around , which suggested that either Jupiter had once been much further from the Sun, or that the interstellar debris that the Solar system had formed from was much colder than had been thought.

===Orbiter===

With the probe data collected, the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter&#x27;s next task was to slow down in order to avoid heading off into the outer solar system. A burn sequence commencing at 00:27 UTC on December 8 and lasting 49 minutes reduced the spacecraft&#x27;s speed by and it entered a parking orbit with an orbital period of 198 days. The &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter thus became the first artificial satellite of Jupiter. Most of its initial orbit was occupied transmitting the data from the probe back to Earth. When the orbiter reached its apojove on March 26, 1996, the main engine was fired again to increase the orbit from four times the radius of Jupiter to ten times. By this time the orbiter had received half the radiation allowed for in the mission plan, and the higher orbit was to conserve the instruments for as long as possible by limiting the radiation exposure.

The spacecraft traveled around Jupiter in elongated ellipses, each orbit lasting about two months. The differing distances from Jupiter afforded by these orbits allowed &quot;Galileo&quot; to sample different parts of the planet&#x27;s extensive magnetosphere. The orbits were designed for close-up flybys of Jupiter&#x27;s largest moons. A naming scheme was devised for the orbits: a code with the first letter of the moon being encountered on that orbit (or &quot;J&quot; if none was encountered) plus the orbit number.

===Mission extension===

After the primary mission concluded on December 7, 1997, most of the mission staff departed, including O&#x27;Neil, but about a fifth of them remained. The &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter commenced an extended mission known as the &quot;Galileo&quot; Europa Mission (GEM), which ran until December 31, 1999. This was a low-cost mission, with a budget of $30 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The reason for calling it as the &quot;Europa&quot; mission rather than the &quot;Extended&quot; mission was political; although it was wasteful to scrap a spacecraft that was still functional and capable of performing a continuing mission, Congress took a dim view of requests for more money for projects that had already been fully funded. This was avoided through rebranding.

The smaller GEM team did not have the resources to deal with problems, but when they arose it was able to temporarily recall former team members for intensive efforts to solve them. The spacecraft performed several flybys of Europa, Callisto and Io. On each one the spacecraft collected only two days&#x27; worth of data instead of the seven it had collected during the prime mission. The radiation environment near Io, which &quot;Galileo&quot; approached to within on November 26, 1999, on orbit I25, was very unhealthy for &quot;Galileo&quot; systems, and so these flybys were saved for the extended mission when loss of the spacecraft would be more acceptable.

By the time GEM ended, most of the spacecraft was operating well beyond its original design specifications, having absorbed more than 600 kilorads in between 1995 and 2002, three times the radiation exposure that it had been built to withstand. Many of the instruments were no longer operating at peak performance, but were still functional, so a second extension, the &quot;Galileo&quot; Millennium Mission (GMM) was authorized. This was intended to run until March 2001, but it was subsequently extended until January 2003. GMM included return visits to Europa, Io, Ganymede and Callisto, and for the first time to Amalthea. The total cost of the original &quot;Galileo&quot; mission was about (equivalent to $ billion in ). Of this, (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on spacecraft development. Another $110 million (equivalent to $ million in ) was contributed by international agencies.

===Io===
The innermost of the four Galilean moons, Io is roughly the same size as Earth&#x27;s moon, with a mean radius of . It is in orbital resonance with Ganymede and Europa, and tidally locked with Jupiter, so just as the Earth&#x27;s Moon always has the same side facing Earth, Io always has the same side facing Jupiter. It has a faster orbit though, with a rotation period of 1.769 days. As a result, the rotational and tidal forces on Io are 220 times as great as those on Earth&#x27;s moon. These frictional forces are sufficient to melt rock, creating volcanoes and lava flows. Although only a third of the size of Earth, Io generates twice as much heat. While geological events occur on Earth over periods of thousands or even millions of years, cataclysmic events are common on Io. Visible changes occurred between orbits of &quot;Galileo&quot;. The colorful surface is a mixture of red, white and yellow sulfur compounds.
&quot;Galileo&quot; flew past Io, but in the interest of protecting the tape recorder, O&#x27;Neil decided to forego collecting images. To use the SSI camera meant operating the tape recorder at high speed, with sudden stops and starts, whereas the fields and particles instruments only required the tape recorder to run continuously at slow speeds, and it was believed that it could handle this. This was a crushing blow to scientists, some of whom had waited years for the opportunity. No other Io encounters were scheduled during the prime mission because it was feared that the high radiation levels close to Jupiter would damage the spacecraft. However, valuable information was still obtained; Doppler data used to measure Io&#x27;s gravitational field revealed that Io had a core of molten iron and iron sulfide.

Another opportunity to observe Io arose during the &quot;Galileo&quot; Europa Mission (GEM), when &quot;Galileo&quot; flew past Io on orbits I24 and I25, and it would revisit Io during the &quot;Galileo&quot; Millennium Mission (GMM) on orbits I27, I31, I32 and I33. As &quot;Galileo&quot; approached Io on I24 at 11:09 UTC on October 11, 1999, it entered safe mode. Apparently, high-energy electrons had altered a bit on a memory chip. When it entered safe mode, the spacecraft turned off all non-essential functions. Normally it took seven to ten days to diagnose and recover from a safe mode incident; this time the &quot;Galileo&quot; Project team at JPL had nineteen hours before the encounter with Io. After a frantic effort, they managed to diagnose a problem that had never been seen before, and restore the spacecraft systems with just two hours to spare. Not all of the planned activities could be carried out, but &quot;Galileo&quot; obtained a series of high-resolution color images of the Pillan Patera, and Zamama, Prometheus, and Pele volcanic eruption centers.

When &quot;Galileo&quot; next approached Io on I25 at 03:40 UTC on November 26, 1999, JPL were eating their Thanksgiving dinner at the &quot;Galileo&quot; Mission Control Center when, with the encounter with Io just four hours away, the spacecraft again entered safe mode. This time the problem was traced to a software patch implemented to bring &quot;Galileo&quot; out of safe mode during I24. Fortunately, the spacecraft had not shut down as much as it had on I24, and the team at JPL were able to bring it back online. During I24 they had done so with two hours to spare; this time, they had just three minutes. Nonetheless, the flyby was successful, with &quot;Galileo&quot; NIMS and SSI camera capturing an erupting volcano that generated a long plume of lava that was sufficiently large and hot to have also been detected by the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii. While such events were more common and spectacular on Io than on Earth, it was extremely fortuitous to have captured it; planetary scientist Alfred McEwen estimated the odds at 1 in 500.
The safe-mode incidents on I24 and I25 left some gaps in the data, which I27 targeted. This time &quot;Galileo&quot; passed over the surface of Io. At this time, the spacecraft was nearly at the maximum distance from Earth, and there was a solar conjunction, a period when the Sun blocked the line of sight between Earth and Jupiter. As a consequence, three quarters of the observations had to be taken over a period of three hours. NIMS images revealed fourteen active volcanoes in a region thought to contain just four. Images of Loki Patera showed that in the four and half months between I24 and I27, some had been covered in fresh lava. A series of observations of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) had to be cancelled due to yet another safe-mode event. Radiation exposure caused a transient bus reset, a computer hardware error resulting in a safe mode event. A software patch implemented after the Europa encounter on orbit E19 guarded against this when the spacecraft was within 15 Jupiter radii of the planet, but this time it occurred at 29 Jupiter radii. The safe mode event also caused a loss of tape playback time, but the project managers decided to carry over some Io data into orbit G28, and play it back then. This limited the amount of tape space available for that Ganymede encounter, but the Io data was considered to be more valuable.

The discovery of Io&#x27;s iron core raised the possibility that it had a magnetic field. The I24, I25 and I27 encounters had involved passes over Io&#x27;s equator, which made it difficult to determine whether Io had its own magnetic field or one induced by Jupiter. Accordingly, on orbit I31, &quot;Galileo&quot; passed within of the surface of the north pole of Io, and on orbit I32 it flew over the south pole. After examining the magnetometer results, planetary scientist Margaret G. Kivelson, announced that Io had no intrinsic magnetic field, which meant that its molten iron core did not have the same convective properties as that of Earth.

On I31 &quot;Galileo&quot; sped through an area that had been in the plume of the Tvashtar Paterae volcano, and it was hoped that the plume could be sampled. This time, Tvashtar was quiet, but the spacecraft flew through the plume of another, previously unknown, volcano away. What had been assumed to be hot ash from the volcanic eruption turned out to be sulfur dioxide snowflakes, each consisting of 15 to 20 molecules clustered together. &quot;Galileo&quot; final return to Io on orbit I33 was marred by another safe mode incident, and much of the hoped-for data was lost.

===Europa===

Although the smallest of the four Galilean moons, with a radius of , Europa is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system. Observations from Earth indicated that it was covered in ice. Like Io, Europa is tidally locked with Jupiter. It is in orbital resonance with Io and Ganymede, with its 85-hour orbit being twice that of Io, but half that of Ganymede. Conjunctions with Io always occur on the opposite side of Jupiter to those with Ganymede. Europa is therefore subject to tidal effects. There is no evidence of volcanism like on Io, but &quot;Galileo&quot; revealed that the surface ice was covered in cracks.

Some observations of Europa were made during orbits G1 and G2. On C3, &quot;Galileo&quot; conducted a &quot;nontargeted&quot; encounter of Europa—meaning a secondary flyby at a distance of up to —on November 6, 1996. During E4 from December 15 to 22, 1996, &quot;Galileo&quot; flew within of Europa, but data transmission was hindered by a Solar occultation that blocked transmission for ten days.

&quot;Galileo&quot; returned to Europa on E6 in January 1997, this time at a height of , to analyze oval-shaped features in the infrared and ultraviolet spectra. Occultations by Europa, Io and Jupiter provided data on the atmospheric profiles of them, and measurements were made of Europa&#x27;s gravitational field. On E11 from November 2 to 9, 1997, data was collected on the magnetosphere. Due to the problems with the HGA, only about two percent of the anticipated number of images of Europa were obtained by the primary mission. On the GEM, the first eight orbits (E12 through E19) were all dedicated to Europa, and &quot;Galileo&quot; paid it a final visit on E26 during the GMM.
Images of Europa also showed few impact craters. It seemed unlikely that it had escaped the meteor and comet impacts that scarred Ganymede and Callisto, so this indicated Europa has an active geology that renews the surface and obliterates craters. Astronomer Clark Chapman argued that, assuming a crater occurs in Europa once every million years, and given only about twenty have been spotted on Europa, the implication is that the surface must only be about 10 million years old. With more data on hand, in 2003 a team led by Kevin Zahle at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center arrived at a figure of 30 to 70 million years. Tidal flexing of up to per day was the most likely culprit. But not all scientists were convinced; Michael Carr, a planetologist from the US Geological Survey, argued that, on the contrary, Europa&#x27;s surface age was closer to a billion years. He compared the craters on Ganymede with those on Earth&#x27;s moon, and concluded that the satellites of Jupiter were not subject to the same amount of cratering.

Evidence of surface renewal hinted at the possibility of a viscous layer below the surface of warm ice or liquid water. NIMS observations by &quot;Galileo&quot; indicated that the surface of Europa appeared to contain magnesium- and sodium-based salts. A likely source was brine below the ice crust. Further evidence was provided by the magnetometer, which reported that the magnetic field was induced by Jupiter. This could be explained by the existence of a spherical shell of conductive material like salt water. Since the surface temperature on Europa was , any water breaching the surface ice would instantly freeze over. Heat required to keep water in a liquid state could not come from the Sun, which at that distance had only 4 percent of the intensity it had on Earth, but ice is a good insulator, and the heat could be provided by the tidal flexing. &quot;Galileo&quot; also yielded evidence that the crust of Europa had slipped over time, moving south on the hemisphere facing Jupiter, and north on the far side.
There was acrimonious debate among scientists over the thickness of the ice crust, and those who presented results indicating that it might be thinner than the proposed by the accredited scientists on the &quot;Galileo&quot; Imaging Team faced intimidation, scorn, and reduced career opportunities. The &quot;Galileo&quot; Imaging Team was led by Michael J. Belton from the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Scientists who planned imaging sequences had the exclusive right to the initial interpretation of the &quot;Galileo&quot; data, most which was performed by their research students. The scientific community did not want a repetition of the 1979 Morabito incident, when Linda A. Morabito, an engineer at JPL working on &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, discovered the first active extraterrestrial volcano on Io. The Imaging Team controlled the manner in which discoveries were presented to the scientific community and the public through press conferences, conference papers and publications.

Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995 reported that Europa had a thin oxygen atmosphere. This was confirmed by &quot;Galileo&quot; in six experiments on orbits E4 and E6 during occultations when Europa was between &quot;Galileo&quot; and the Earth. This allowed Canberra and Goldstone to investigate the ionosphere of Europa by measuring the degree to which the radio beam was diffracted by charged particles. This indicated the presence of water ions, which were most likely water molecules that had been dislodged from the surface ice and then ionized by the Sun or the Jovian magnetosphere. The presence of an ionosphere was sufficient to deduce the existence of a thin atmosphere on Europa.

On December 11, 2013, NASA reported, based on results from the &quot;Galileo&quot; mission, the detection of &quot;clay-like minerals&quot; (specifically, phyllosilicates), often associated with organic materials, on the icy crust of Europa. The presence of the minerals may have been the result of a collision with an asteroid or comet.

===Ganymede===

The largest of the Galilean moons with a radius of , Ganymede is larger than Earth&#x27;s moon, the dwarf planet Pluto or the planet Mercury. It is the largest of the moons in the Solar system that are characterized by large amounts of water ice, which also includes Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, and Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton. Ganymede has three times as much water for its mass as Earth has.

When &quot;Galileo&quot; entered Jovian orbit, it did so at an orbital inclination to the Jovian equator, and therefore in the orbital plane of the four Galilean moons. To transfer orbit while conserving propellant, two slingshot maneuvers were performed. On G1, the gravity of Ganymede was used to slow the spacecraft&#x27;s orbital period from 210 to 72 days to allow for more encounters and to take &quot;Galileo&quot; out of the more intense regions of radiation. On G2, the gravity assist was employed to put it into a coplanar orbit to permit subsequent encounters with Io, Europa and Callisto.

Although the primary purpose of G1 and G2 was navigational, the opportunity to make some observations was not missed. The plasma-wave experiment and the magnetometer detected a magnetic field with a strength of about , more than strong enough to create a separate magnetosphere within that of Jupiter. This was the first time that a magnetic field had ever been detected on a moon contained within the magnetosphere of its host planet. This discovery led naturally to questions about its origin. The evidence pointed to an iron or iron sulfide core and mantle below the surface, encased in ice. Margaret Kivelson, the scientist in charge of the magnetometer experiment, contended that the induced magnetic field required an iron core, and speculated that an electrically conductive layer was required, possibly a brine ocean below the surface.
&quot;Galileo&quot; returned to Ganymede on orbits G7 and G9 in April and May 1997, and on G28 and G29 in May and December 2000 on the GMM. Images of the surface revealed two types of terrain: highly cratered dark regions and grooved terrain sulcus. Images of the Arbela Sulcus taken on G28 made Ganymede look more like Europa, but tidal flexing could not provide sufficient heat to keep water in liquid form on Ganymede, although it may have made a contribution. One possibility was radioactivity, which might provide sufficient heat for liquid water to exist below the surface. Another possibility was volcanism. Slushy water or ice reaching the surface would quickly freeze over, creating areas of a relatively smooth surface.
===Callisto===

Callisto is the outermost of the Galilean moons, and the most pockmarked, indeed the most of any body in the Solar system. So many craters must have taken billions of years to accumulate, which gave scientists the idea that its surface was as much as four billion years old, and provided a record of meteor activity in the Solar system. &quot;Galileo&quot; visited Callisto on orbits C3, C9 and C100 during the prime mission, and then on C20, C21, C22 and C23 during the GEM. When the cameras observed Callisto close up, there was a puzzling absence of small craters. The surface features appeared to have been eroded, indicating that they had been subject to active geological processes.

&quot;Galileo&quot; flyby of Callisto on C3 marked the first time that the Deep Space Network operated a link between its antennae in Canberra and Goldstone that allowed them to operate as a gigantic array, thereby enabling a higher bit rate. With the assistance of the antenna at Parkes, this raised the effective bandwidth to as much as 1,000 bits per second.

Data accumulated on C3 indicated that Callisto had a homogeneous composition, with heavy and light elements intermixed. This was estimated to be composed of 60 percent silicate, iron and iron sulfide rock and 40 percent water ice. This was overturned by further radio Doppler observations on C9 and C10, which indicated that rock had settled towards the core, and therefore that Callisto indeed has a differentiated internal structure, although not as much so as the other Galilean moons.
Observations made with &quot;Galileo&quot; magnetometer indicated that Callisto had no magnetic field of its own, and therefore lacked an iron core like Ganymede&#x27;s, but that it did have an induced field from Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere. Because ice is too poor a conductor to generate this effect, it pointed to the possibility that Callisto, like Europa and Ganymede, might have a subsurface ocean of brine. &quot;Galileo&quot; made its closest encounter with Callisto on C30, when it made a pass over the surface, during which it photographed the Asgard, Valhalla and Bran craters. This was used for slingshot maneuvers to set up the final encounters with Io on I31 and I32.

===Amalthea===

Although &quot;Galileo&quot; main mission was to explore the Galilean moons, it also captured images of four of the inner moons, Thebe, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Metis. Such images were only possible from a spacecraft; to Earth-based telescopes they were merely specks of light. Two years of Jupiter&#x27;s intense radiation took its toll on the spacecraft&#x27;s systems, and its fuel supply was running low in the early 2000s. &quot;Galileo&quot; cameras were deactivated on January 17, 2002, after they had sustained irreparable radiation damage.

NASA engineers were able to recover the damaged tape-recorder electronics, and &quot;Galileo&quot; continued to return scientific data until it was deorbited in 2003, performing one last scientific experiment: a measurement of Amalthea&#x27;s mass as the spacecraft swung by it. This was tricky to arrange; to be useful, &quot;Galileo&quot; had to fly within of Amalthea, but not so close as to crash into it. This was complicated by its irregular potato-like shape. It was tidally locked, pointing its long axis towards Jupiter. A successful flyby meant knowing which direction the asteroid was pointed in relation to &quot;Galileo&quot; at all times.

&quot;Galileo&quot; flew by Amalthea on November 5, 2002, during its 34th orbit, allowing a measurement of the moon&#x27;s mass as it passed within of its surface. The results startled the scientific team; they revealed that Amalthea had a mass of , and with a volume of , it therefore had a density of 857 ± 99 kilograms per cubic meter, less than that of water.

A final discovery occurred during the last two orbits of the mission. When the spacecraft passed the orbit of Amalthea, the star scanner detected unexpected flashes of light that were reflections from seven to nine moonlets. None of the individual moonlets was reliably sighted twice, so no orbits were determined. It is believed that they were most likely debris ejected from Amalthea that formed a tenuous, and perhaps temporary, ring around Jupiter.

===Star scanner===
&quot;Galileo&quot; star scanner was a small optical telescope that provided an absolute attitude reference, but it made several scientific discoveries serendipitously. In the prime mission, it was found that the star scanner was able to detect high-energy particles as a noise signal. This data was eventually calibrated to show the particles were predominantly &gt; electrons that were trapped in the Jovian magnetic belts, and released to the Planetary Data System.

A second discovery occurred in 2000. The star scanner was observing a set of stars that included the second magnitude star Delta Velorum. At one point, this star dimmed for 8 hours below the star scanner&#x27;s detection threshold. Subsequent analysis of &quot;Galileo&quot; data and work by amateur and professional astronomers showed that Delta Velorum is the brightest known eclipsing binary, brighter at maximum than Algol. It has a primary period of 45 days and the dimming is just visible with the naked eye.

===Radiation-related anomalies===

Jupiter&#x27;s uniquely harsh radiation environment caused over 20 anomalies over the course of &quot;Galileo&quot; mission, in addition to the incidents expanded upon below. Despite having exceeded its radiation design limit by at least a factor of three, the spacecraft survived all these anomalies. Work-arounds were found eventually for all of these problems, and &quot;Galileo&quot; was never rendered entirely non-functional by Jupiter&#x27;s radiation. The radiation limits for &quot;Galileo&quot; computers were based on data returned from &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, since much of the design work was underway before the two &quot;Voyagers&quot; arrived at Jupiter in 1979.

A typical effect of the radiation was that several of the science instruments suffered increased noise while within about of Jupiter. The SSI camera began producing totally white images when the spacecraft was hit by the exceptional Bastille Day coronal mass ejection in 2000, and did so again on subsequent close approaches to Jupiter. The quartz crystal used as the frequency reference for the radio suffered permanent frequency shifts with each Jupiter approach. A spin detector failed, and the spacecraft gyro output was biased by the radiation environment.

The most severe effects of the radiation were current leakages somewhere in the spacecraft&#x27;s power bus, most likely across brushes at a spin bearing connecting rotor and stator sections of the orbiter. These current leakages triggered a reset of the onboard computer and caused it to go into safe mode. The resets occurred when the spacecraft was either close to Jupiter or in the region of space magnetically downstream of Jupiter. A change to the software was made in April 1999 that allowed the onboard computer to detect these resets and autonomously recover, so as to avoid safe mode.

===Tape recorder problems===
Routine maintenance of the tape recorder involved winding the tape halfway down its length and back again to prevent it sticking. In November 2002, after the completion of the mission&#x27;s only encounter with Jupiter&#x27;s moon Amalthea, problems with playback of the tape recorder again plagued &quot;Galileo&quot;. About 10 minutes after the closest approach of the Amalthea flyby, &quot;Galileo&quot; stopped collecting data, shut down all of its instruments, and went into safe mode, apparently as a result of exposure to Jupiter&#x27;s intense radiation environment. Though most of the Amalthea data was already written to tape, it was found that the recorder refused to respond to commands telling it to play back data.

After weeks of troubleshooting of an identical flight spare of the recorder on the ground, it was determined that the cause of the malfunction was a reduction of light output in three infrared Optek OP133 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) located in the drive electronics of the recorder&#x27;s motor encoder wheel. The gallium arsenide LEDs had been particularly sensitive to proton-irradiation-induced atomic lattice displacement defects, which greatly decreased their effective light output and caused the drive motor&#x27;s electronics to falsely believe the motor encoder wheel was incorrectly positioned.

&quot;Galileo&quot; flight team then began a series of &quot;annealing&quot; sessions, where current was passed through the LEDs for hours at a time to heat them to a point where some of the crystalline lattice defects would be shifted back into place, thus increasing the LED&#x27;s light output. After about 100 hours of annealing and playback cycles, the recorder was able to operate for up to an hour at a time. After many subsequent playback and cooling cycles, the complete transmission back to Earth of all recorded Amalthea flyby data was successful.

===End of mission and deorbit===

When the exploration of Mars was being considered in the early 1960s, Carl Sagan and Sidney Coleman produced a paper concerning contamination of the red planet. In order that scientists could determine whether native life forms existed before the planet became contaminated by micro-organisms from Earth, they proposed that space missions should aim at a 99.9 percent chance that contamination should not occur. This figure was adopted by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the International Council of Scientific Unions in 1964, and was subsequently applied to all planetary probes.

The danger was highlighted in 1969 when the Apollo 12 astronauts returned components of the Surveyor 3 spacecraft that had landed on the Moon three years before, and it was found that microbes were still viable even after three years in that harsh climate. An alternative was the Prime Directive, a philosophy of non-interference with alien life forms enunciated by the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series that prioritized the interests of the life forms over those of scientists. Given the (admittedly slim) prospect of life on Europa, scientists Richard Greenberg and Randall Tufts proposed that a new standard be set of no greater chance of contamination than that which might occur naturally by meteorites.

&quot;Galileo&quot; had not been sterilized prior to launch and could conceivably have carried bacteria from Earth. Therefore, a plan was formulated to send the probe directly into Jupiter, in an intentional crash to eliminate the possibility of an impact with Jupiter&#x27;s moons, particularly Europa, and prevent a forward contamination. On April 14, 2003, the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter reached its greatest orbital distance from Jupiter for the entire mission since orbital insertion, , before plunging back towards the gas giant for its final impact. At the completion of J35, its final orbit around the Jovian system, &quot;Galileo&quot; struck Jupiter in darkness just south of the equator on September 21, 2003, at 18:57 UTC. Its impact speed was approximately .

===Major findings===
# The composition of Jupiter differs from that of the Sun, indicating that Jupiter has evolved since the formation of the Solar System.
# &quot;Galileo&quot; made the first observation of ammonia clouds in another planet&#x27;s atmosphere. The atmosphere creates ammonia ice particles from material coming up from lower depths.
# Io was confirmed to have extensive volcanic activity that is 100 times greater than that found on Earth. The heat and frequency of eruptions are reminiscent of early Earth.
# Complex plasma interactions in Io&#x27;s atmosphere create immense electrical currents which couple to Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere.
# Several lines of evidence from &quot;Galileo&quot; support the theory that liquid oceans exist under Europa&#x27;s icy surface.
# Ganymede possesses its own, substantial magnetic field – the first satellite known to have one.
# &quot;Galileo&quot; magnetic data provided evidence that Europa, Ganymede and Callisto have a liquid salt water layer under the visible surface.
# Evidence exists that Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto all have a thin atmospheric layer known as a &quot;surface-bound exosphere&quot;.
# Jupiter&#x27;s ring system is formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids smash into the planet&#x27;s four small inner moons. The outermost ring is actually two rings, one embedded with the other. There is probably a separate ring along Amalthea&#x27;s orbit as well.
# The &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft identified the global structure and dynamics of a giant planet&#x27;s magnetosphere.

==Follow-on missions==
There was a spare &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft that was considered by the NASA–ESA Outer Planets Study Team in 1983 for a mission to Saturn, but it was passed over in favor of a newer design, which became &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot;. While &quot;Galileo&quot; was operating, &quot;Ulysses&quot; passed by Jupiter in 1992 on its mission to study the Sun&#x27;s polar regions, and &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; coasted by the planet in 2000 and 2001 en route to Saturn. &quot;New Horizons&quot; passed close by Jupiter in 2007 for a gravity assist en route to Pluto, and it too collected data on the planet.

===&quot;Juno&quot;===
The next mission to orbit Jupiter was NASA&#x27;s &quot;Juno&quot; spacecraft, which was launched on August 5, 2011, and entered Jovian orbit on July 4, 2016. Although intended for a two-year mission, it is still active in 2024 and expected to continue until September 2025. &quot;Juno&quot; provided the first views of Jupiter&#x27;s north pole and new insights into Jupiter&#x27;s aurorae, magnetic field, and atmosphere. Information gathered about Jovian lightning prompted revision of earlier theories, and analysis of the frequency of interplanetary dust impacts (primarily on the backs of the solar panels), as &quot;Juno&quot; passed between Earth and the asteroid belt, indicated that this dust comes from Mars, rather than from comets or asteroids, as was previously thought.

===Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer===
The European Space Agency is planning to return to the Jovian system with the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE). This was launched from Europe&#x27;s Spaceport in French Guiana on April 14, 2023, and is expected to reach Jupiter in July 2031.

===&quot;Europa Clipper&quot;===
Even before &quot;Galileo&quot; concluded, NASA considered the Europa Orbiter, but it was canceled in 2002. A lower-cost version was then studied, which led to &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; being approved in 2015. This mission launched from Kennedy Space Center on October 14, 2024 and is expected to reach Jupiter in April 2030.

===&quot;Europa Lander&quot;===
A lander, simply called &quot;Europa Lander&quot; was assessed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. , this mission remains a concept, although some funds were released for instrument development and maturation.

<doc id="13078" wikidata="Q19014" url="?curid=13078" title="Garden of Eden">
<text>In Abrahamic religions, the Garden of Eden (; ; ) or Garden of God ( and ), also called the Terrestrial Paradise, is the biblical paradise described in Genesis 2–3 and Ezekiel 28 and 31.

The location of Eden is described in the Book of Genesis as the source of four tributaries. Various suggestions have been made for its location: at the head of the Persian Gulf, in southern Mesopotamia where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers run into the sea; in Armenia, and even in Jackson County, Missouri. Others theorize that Eden was the entire Fertile Crescent or a region of &quot;considerable size&quot; in Mesopotamia, where its native inhabitants still exist in cities such as Telassar.

Like the Genesis flood narrative, the Genesis creation narrative and the account of the Tower of Babel, the story of Eden echoes the Mesopotamian myth of a king, as a primordial man, who is placed in a divine garden to guard the tree of life. Scholars note that the Eden narrative shows parallels with aspects of Solomon&#x27;s Temple and Jerusalem, attesting to its nature as a sacred place. Mentions of Eden are also made in the Bible elsewhere in Genesis, in Isaiah 51:3, Ezekiel 36:35, and Joel 2:3; Zechariah 14 and Ezekiel 47 use paradisical imagery without naming Eden.

The name derives from the Akkadian , from a Sumerian word meaning or , closely related to an Aramaic root word meaning . Another interpretation associates the name with a Hebrew word for &#x27;pleasure&#x27;; thus the Vulgate reads in Genesis 2:8, and the Douay–Rheims Bible, following, has the wording &quot;And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure&quot;.

==Biblical narratives==
===Genesis===

The second part of the Genesis creation narrative, Genesis 2:4–3:24, opens with YHWH-Elohim (translated here &quot;the Lord God&quot;) creating the first man (Adam), whom he placed in a garden that he planted &quot;eastward in Eden&quot;:

The man was free to eat from any tree in the garden except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which was taboo. Last of all, God made a woman (Eve) from a rib of the man to be a companion for the man. In Genesis 3, the man and the woman were seduced by the serpent into eating the forbidden fruit, and they were expelled from the garden to prevent them from eating of the tree of life, and thus living forever. Cherubim were placed east of the garden, &quot;and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life&quot;.

Genesis 2:10–14 lists four rivers in association with the garden of Eden: Pishon, Gihon, Tigris (Hiddekel in Hebrew), and the Euphrates (Perath in Hebrew). It also refers to the land of Cush—translated/interpreted as Ethiopia, but thought by some to equate to &quot;Cossaea&quot;, a Greek name for the land of the Kassites. These lands lie north of Elam, immediately to the east of ancient Babylon, which, unlike Ethiopia, does lie within the region being described. In &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, the first-century Jewish historian Josephus identifies the Pishon as what &quot;the Greeks called Ganges&quot; and the Geon (Gehon) as the Nile.

===Ezekiel===
In Ezekiel 28:12–19, the prophet Ezekiel the &quot;son of man&quot; sets down God&#x27;s word against the king of Tyre: the king was the &quot;seal of perfection&quot;, adorned with precious stones from the day of his creation, placed by God in the garden of Eden on the holy mountain as a guardian cherub. However, the king sinned through wickedness and violence, and so he was driven out of the garden and thrown to the earth, where now he is consumed by God&#x27;s fire: &quot;All those who knew you in the nations are appalled at you, you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.&quot; (Ezekiel 28:19).

==Proposed locations==
The location of Eden is described in Genesis 2:10–14:

Suggestions for the location of Eden include the head of the Persian Gulf, as argued by Juris Zarins, in southern Mesopotamia where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers run into the sea; and in the Armenian Highlands or Armenian National Plateau. British archaeologist David Rohl locates it in Iran, and in the vicinity of Tabriz, but this suggestion has not been adopted by mainstream academia.

Others theorize that Eden was merely a region of &quot;considerable size&quot; in Mesopotamia, where its native inhabitants still exist in cities such as Telassar, based on verses such as Isaiah 37:12. Or that it encompassed the entire Fertile Crescent.

According to Terje Stordalen, the Book of Ezekiel places Eden in Lebanon. &quot;[I]t appears that the Lebanon is an alternative placement in Phoenician myth (as in Ez 28,13, III.48) of the Garden of Eden&quot;, and there are connections between paradise, the Garden of Eden and the forests of Lebanon (possibly used symbolically) within prophetic writings. Edward Lipinski and Peter Kyle McCarter have suggested that the garden of the gods, the oldest Sumerian analog of the Garden of Eden, relates to a mountain sanctuary in the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges.

Some religious groups have believed the location of the garden to be local to them, outside of the Middle East. Some early leaders of Mormonism held that it was located in Jackson County, Missouri. The 20th-century Panacea Society believed it was located at the site of their home town of Bedford, England, while preacher Elvy E. Callaway believed it was on the Apalachicola River in Florida, near the town of Bristol. Some suggested that the location is in Jerusalem.

On his third voyage to the Americas in 1498, Christopher Columbus thought he may have reached the Earthly Paradise upon first seeing the South American mainland.

In his book &quot;The Creation, the Garden of Eden and the Origin of the Chinese&quot;, Tse Tsan-tai argued that the Garden of Eden was located in modern-day Xinjiang.

==Blissful garden concept==

Scholars have identified and proposed connections to similar concepts from ancient religions and mythologies, and have studied the post-scriptural evolution of the concept in religion and arts.

===Sumeria and ancient Greece; Renaissance===
A number of parallel concepts to the biblical Garden of Eden exist in various other religions and mythologies. Dilmun in the Sumerian story of &quot;Enki and Ninhursag&quot; is a paradisaical abode of the immortals, where sickness and death were unknown. The garden of the Hesperides in Greek mythology was also somewhat similar to the Jewish concept of the Garden of Eden, and by the 16th century a larger intellectual association was made in the Cranach painting.

===Canaanite origin theory===
By studying late-13th-century BCE clay tablets from Ugarit, Hebrew Bible scholars M.J.A. Korpel and J.C. de Moor reconstructed close Canaanite parallels, which they posit as being the origin of the biblical creation myth from the first chapters of Genesis including the Garden of Eden and Adam narrative. Their reconstructed texts talk about the creator deity El, who lived in a vineyard or garden together with his wife Asherah on Mount Ararat. Another god, Horon, tries to depose El and when thrown down from the mountain, he transforms the Tree of Life from the garden into a Tree of Death. Horon also spreads around a poisonous fog, Adam is sent from the mountain to restore life on earth, Horon takes the shape of a large serpent and bites him, which leads to Adam and his wife losing their immortality. However, John Day argues that these stories are not explicitly attested in the Ugaritic texts but are reconstructed on the basis of speculative and dubious suppositions.

===Evolution of Old Iranian &quot;paradise&quot; concept===
The word &quot;paradise&quot; entered English from the French , inherited from the Latin , from the Greek (). The Greek, in turn, was derived from an Old Iranian form, itself from the Proto-Iranian &quot;*parādaiĵah-&quot;, &#x27;walled enclosure&#x27;, which was derived from the Old Persian (p-r-d-y-d-a-m, , whence from the Avestan , . The literal meaning of this word is &#x27;walled (enclosure)&#x27;, from &quot;pairi-&quot; &#x27;around&#x27; (cognate with the Greek and the English &quot;peri-&quot;, of identical meaning), and &quot;-diz&quot;, &quot;to make, form (a wall), build&quot; (cognate with the Greek , &#x27;wall&#x27;). The word&#x27;s etymology is ultimately derived from a Proto-Indo-European root, &#x27;, &#x27;to stick and set up (a wall)&#x27;, and &#x27;, &#x27;around&#x27;.

By the 6th/5th century BCE, the Old Iranian word had been borrowed into the Akkadian language as , &#x27;domain&#x27;. It subsequently came to indicate the expansive walled gardens of the First Persian Empire, and was later borrowed into a number of languages: into Greek as (), &#x27;park for animals&#x27;, cf. &quot;Anabasis&quot;, the most famous work of Xenophon; into Aramaic as , &#x27;royal park&#x27;; and into Hebrew (see below).

The idea of a walled enclosure was not preserved in most Iranian usage, and generally came to refer to a plantation or other cultivated area, not necessarily walled. For example, the Old Iranian word survives as in New Persian, as well as its derivative (or ), which denotes a vegetable patch.

====Hebrew Bible and Jewish literature====
The word entered the Hebrew language with the meaning of pardes (), &#x27;orchard&#x27;, appearing thrice in the Tanakh: in the Song of Solomon (), Ecclesiastes (), and Nehemiah ().

The word occurs three times in the Hebrew Bible, but always in contexts other than a connection with Eden: in the Song of Solomon : &quot;Thy plants are an orchard () of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard&quot;; Ecclesiastes : &quot;I made me gardens and orchards (), and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits&quot;; and in Nehemiah : &quot;And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king&#x27;s orchard (), that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city&quot;. In these examples, clearly means &#x27;orchard&#x27; or &#x27;park&#x27;, but in the Jewish apocalyptic literature and in the Talmud &quot;paradise&quot; gains its associations with the Garden of Eden and its heavenly prototype, a meaning also present in the New Testament.

Italian historian Mario Liverani argues that the Garden of Eden was modeled on Persian royal gardens, while John Day argues that linguistic and other evidence indicates that the yahwistic Eden story was composed before the Persian period. US archaeologist Lawrence Stager posits that the biblical Eden narrative drew from aspects of Solomon&#x27;s palace and temple compound and Jerusalem.

====Septuagint and New Testament====
In the Septuagint (3rd–1st centuries BCE), the Greek () was used to translate both the Hebrew () and (), meaning &#x27;garden&#x27; (e.g. , ): it is from this usage that the use of &quot;paradise&quot; to refer to the Garden of Eden derives.

In the New Testament &quot;paradise&quot; becomes the realm of the blessed (as opposed to the realm of the cursed) among those who have already died, with literary Hellenistic influences.

====Quran====
The same usage as in the Septuagint also appears in Arabic and in the Quran as .

==Other views==
===Jewish eschatology===

In the Talmud and the Jewish Kabbalah, the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called &quot;Garden in Eden&quot;. The first is rather terrestrial, of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation, known as the &quot;lower Eden&quot; ( meaning garden). The second is envisioned as being celestial, the habitation of righteous, Jewish and non-Jewish, immortal souls, known as the &quot;higher Eden&quot;. The rabbis differentiate between and Eden. Adam is said to have dwelt only in the , whereas Eden is said never to be witnessed by any mortal eye.

According to Jewish eschatology, the higher Eden is called the &quot;Garden of Righteousness&quot;. It has been created since the beginning of the world, and will appear gloriously at the end of time. The righteous dwelling there will enjoy the sight of the heavenly carrying the throne of God. Each of the righteous will walk with God, who will lead them in a dance. Its Jewish and non-Jewish inhabitants are &quot;clothed with garments of light and eternal life, and eat of the tree of life&quot; (Enoch 58,3) near to God and his anointed ones. This Jewish rabbinical concept of a higher Eden is opposed by the Hebrew terms and , figurative names for the place of spiritual purification for the wicked dead in Judaism, a place envisioned as being at the greatest possible distance from heaven.

Some modern Orthodox Jews believe that history will complete itself and the ultimate destination will be when all mankind returns to the Garden of Eden.

====Legends of the Jews====
In the 1909 book &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot;, Louis Ginzberg compiled Jewish legends found in rabbinic literature. Among the legends are ones about the two Gardens of Eden. Beyond Paradise is the higher Eden, where God is enthroned and explains the Torah to its inhabitants. The higher Eden contains three hundred and ten worlds and is divided into seven compartments. The compartments are not described, though it is implied that each compartment is greater than the previous one and is joined based on one&#x27;s merit. The first compartment is for Jewish martyrs, the second for those who drowned, the third for &quot;Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai and his disciples,&quot; the fourth for those whom the cloud of glory carried off, the fifth for penitents, the sixth for youths who have never sinned; and the seventh for the poor who lived decently and studied the Torah.

In chapter two, &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot; gives a brief description of the lower Eden. The tree of knowledge is a hedge around the tree of life, which is so vast that &quot;it would take a man five hundred years to traverse a distance equal to the diameter of the trunk&quot;. From beneath the trees flow all the world&#x27;s waters in the form of four rivers: Tigris, Nile, Euphrates, and Ganges. After the fall of man, the world was no longer irrigated by this water. While in the garden, though, Adam and Eve were served meat dishes by angels and the animals of the world understood human language, respected mankind as God&#x27;s image, and feared Adam and Eve. When one dies, one&#x27;s soul must pass through the lower Eden in order to reach the higher Eden. The way to the garden is the Cave of Machpelah that Adam guards. The cave leads to the gate of the garden, guarded by a cherub with a flaming sword. If a soul is unworthy of entering, the sword annihilates it. Within the garden is a pillar of fire and smoke that extends to the higher Eden, which the soul must climb in order to reach the higher Eden.

===Christian views===
====Atemporal fall view====
For some Christians, especially in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, Eden is considered a reality outside of empirical history that affects the entire history of the universe as seen in the idea of an atemporal fall which separates humanity&#x27;s current reduced form of time from the divine life enjoyed in Eden. This idea of an atemporal separation from Eden has been most recently defended by theologians David Bentley Hart, John Behr, and Sergei Bulgakov as well as having roots in the writings of several early church fathers, especially Origen and Maximus the Confessor.

===Islamic view===

The term (&quot;Gardens of Eden&quot; or &quot;Gardens of Perpetual Residence&quot;) is used in the Quran for the destination of the righteous. There are several mentions of &quot;the Garden&quot; in the Quran, while the Garden of Eden, without the word , is commonly the fourth layer of the Islamic heaven and not necessarily thought as the dwelling place of Adam. The Quran refers frequently over various Surah about the first abode of Adam and his spouse (told to be Hawwa or Eve, Quran never named her), including surat Sad, which features 18 verses on the subject (38:71–88), surat al-Baqara, surat al-A&#x27;raf, and surat al-Hijr although sometimes without mentioning the location. The narrative mainly surrounds the resulting expulsion of Adam and his spouse after they were tempted by Iblis (Satan).

Despite the biblical account, the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, the tree of immortality, from which God specifically forbade Adam and his spouse. Some exegesis added an account, about Satan, disguised as a serpent to enter the Garden, repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and his spouse did so, resulting in disobeying God. These stories are also featured in the hadith collections, including al-Tabari.
;Quranic scripture of story
Quranic verses Q. 2:35–38, are believed to tell the story of Adam disobeying God&#x27;s command and eating the Forbidden Fruit, and of God ordered him out of the Garden. One translation (the Clear Quran) that indicates that the Garden of Eden was in Heaven goes: 
* We cautioned, &quot;O Adam! Live with your wife in Paradise (lit. &quot;the Garden&quot;) and eat as freely as you please, but do not approach this tree, or else you will be wrongdoers.&quot; (2:35) 
* But Satan deceived them—leading to their fall from the [blissful] state they were in,1 and We said, &quot;Descend from the heavens [to the earth] as enemies to each other.2 You will find in the earth a residence and provision for your appointed stay.&quot; (2:36)
* Then Adam was inspired with words ˹of prayer˺ by his Lord, so He accepted his repentance. Surely He is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful. (2:37) 
* We said, &quot;Descend all of you! Then when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows it, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. (2:38)
;Location
Quranic verses describe Adam was being expelled from &quot;al-Jannah&quot;, &quot;the garden&quot;, which is the commonly used word for paradise in Islam. However, according to Ibn Kathir (d. 1372) and Ar-Razi (d. 1209), (exegetes of the Quran), four interpretations of the location of the garden prevailed among early Muslims: 
*that the garden was Paradise itself, 
*that it was a separate garden created especially for Adam and his spouse, 
*that it was located on Earth, 
*that it was best for the Muslims not to be concerned with the location of the garden.
According to T. O. Shanavas however, contextual analysis of Quranic verses suggests the Garden of Eden could not have been in Paradise and must have been on earth. (For example, a sahih hadith reports Muhammad said: &quot;Allah says: I have prepared for my righteous servants that which has neither been seen by eyes, nor heard by ears, nor ever conceived by any man.&quot; i.e. no man has ever seen Paradise. Since Adam was a man, he could not have seen paradise, therefore he could not have lived there.)
;Doctrine of &quot;The Fall of Man&quot;
Islamic exegesis does not regard Adam and his spouse&#x27;s expulsion from paradise as punishment for disobedience or a result from abused free will on their part. Instead, ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) writes, God&#x27;s wisdom (&quot;ḥikma&quot;) destined humanity to leave the garden and settle on earth. This is because God wants to unfold the full range of his attributes. If humans were not to live on earth, God could not express his love, forgiveness, and power to his creation. Further, if humans were not to experience suffering, they could neither long for paradise nor appreciate its delights. Khwaja Abdullah Ansari (1006–1088) describes Adam and his spouse&#x27;s expulsion as ultimately caused by God. Nonetheless, despite the paradoxical notion that man has no choice but to comply to God&#x27;s will, this does not mean that humans should not blame themselves for their &quot;sin&quot; of complying. This is exemplified by Adam and his spouse in the Quran (Q. 7:23 &quot;Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will certainly be losers&quot;), in contrast to Iblis (Satan) who blames God for leading him astray (Q. 15:37).

===Latter Day Saints===

Followers of the Latter Day Saint movement believe that after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they resided in a place known as Adam-ondi-Ahman, located in present-day Daviess County, Missouri. It is recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants that Adam blessed his posterity there and that he will return to that place at the time of the final judgment in fulfillment of a prophecy set forth in the Bible.

Numerous early leaders of the Church, including Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and George Q. Cannon, taught that the Garden of Eden itself was located in nearby Jackson County, but there are no surviving first-hand accounts of that doctrine being taught by Joseph Smith himself. LDS doctrine is unclear as to the exact location of the Garden of Eden, but tradition among Latter-Day Saints places it somewhere in the vicinity of Adam-ondi-Ahman, or in Jackson County.

===Gnosticism===
The 2nd-century Gnostic teacher Justin held that there were three original divinities, a transcendental being called the Good, an intermediate male figure known as Elohim and Eden who is an Earth-mother. The world is created from the love of Elohim and Eden, but evil later is brought into the universe when Elohim learns of the existence of the Good above him and ascends trying to reach it.

==Art and literature==

=== Art ===
One of oldest depictions of Garden of Eden is made in Byzantine style in Ravenna, while the city was still under Byzantine control. A preserved blue mosaic is part of the mausoleum of Galla Placidia. Circular motifs represent flowers of the garden of Eden. The Garden of Eden motifs most frequently portrayed in illuminated manuscripts and paintings are the &quot;Sleep of Adam&quot; (&quot;Creation of Eve&quot;), the &quot;Temptation of Eve&quot; by the Serpent, the &quot;Fall of Man&quot; where Adam takes the fruit, and the &quot;Expulsion&quot;. The idyll of &quot;Naming Day in Eden&quot; was less often depicted. Michelangelo depicted a scene at the Garden of Eden on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.

===Literature===
For many medieval writers, the image of the Garden of Eden also creates a location for human love and sexuality, often associated with the classic and medieval trope of the locus amoenus.

In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante Alighieri places the Garden at the top of Mt. Purgatory. Dante, the pilgrim, emerges into the Garden of Eden in Canto 28 of &quot;Purgatorio&quot;. Here he is told that God gave the Garden of Eden to man &quot;in earnest, or as a pledge of eternal life,&quot; but man was only able to dwell there for a short time because he soon fell from grace. In the poem, the Garden of Eden is both human and divine: while it is located on earth at the top of Mt. Purgatory, it also serves as the gateway to the heavens.

Much of Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; occurs in the Garden of Eden.

The first act of Arthur Miller&#x27;s 1972 play &quot;Creation of the World and Other Business&quot; is set in the Garden of Eden.

<text>The glottis (: glottises or glottides) is the opening between the vocal folds (the rima glottidis). The glottis is crucial in producing sound from the vocal folds.

==Etymology==
From Ancient Greek &quot;γλωττίς&quot; (glōttís), derived from &quot;γλῶττα&quot; (glôtta), variant of &quot;γλῶσσα&quot; (glôssa, &quot;tongue&quot;).

==Function==
===Phonation===

As the vocal folds vibrate, the resulting vibration produces a &quot;buzzing&quot; quality to the speech, called voice or voicing or pronunciation.

Sound production that involves moving the vocal folds close together is called &quot;glottal&quot;. English has a voiceless glottal transition spelled &quot;h&quot;. This sound is produced by keeping the vocal folds spread somewhat, resulting in non-turbulent airflow through the glottis. In many accents of English the glottal stop (made by pressing the folds together) is used as a variant allophone of the phoneme (and in some dialects, occasionally of and ); in some languages, this sound is a phoneme of its own. 

Skilled players of the Australian didgeridoo restrict their glottal opening in order to produce the full range of timbres available on the instrument.

The vibration produced is an essential component of &quot;voiced&quot; consonants as well as vowels. If the vocal folds are drawn apart, air flows between them causing no vibration, as in the production of voiceless consonants.

The glottis is also important in the Valsalva maneuver.
