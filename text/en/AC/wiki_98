<text>Erectile dysfunction (ED), also referred to as impotence, is a form of sexual dysfunction in males characterized by the persistent or recurring inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection with sufficient rigidity and duration for satisfactory sexual activity. It is the most common sexual problem in males and can cause psychological distress due to its impact on self-image and sexual relationships.

The majority of ED cases are attributed to physical risk factors and predictive factors. These factors can be categorized as vascular, neurological, local penile, hormonal, and drug-induced. Notable predictors of ED include aging, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, obesity, abnormal lipid levels in the blood, hypogonadism, smoking, depression, and medication use. Approximately 10% of cases are linked to psychosocial factors, encompassing conditions such as depression, stress, and problems within relationships.

The term &quot;erectile dysfunction&quot; does not encompass other erection-related disorders, such as priapism.

Treatment of ED encompasses addressing the underlying causes, lifestyle modification, and addressing psychosocial issues. In many instances, medication-based therapies are used, specifically PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil. These drugs function by dilating blood vessels, facilitating increased blood flow into the spongy tissue of the penis, analogous to opening a valve wider to enhance water flow in a fire hose. Less frequently employed treatments encompass prostaglandin pellets inserted into the urethra, the injection of smooth-muscle relaxants and vasodilators directly into the penis, penile implants, the use of penis pumps, and vascular surgery.

ED is reported in 18% of males aged 50 to 59 years, and 37% in males aged 70 to 75.

==Signs and symptoms==
ED is characterized by the persistent or recurring inability to achieve or maintain an erection of the penis with sufficient rigidity and duration for satisfactory sexual activity. It is defined as the &quot;persistent or recurrent inability to achieve and maintain a penile erection of sufficient rigidity to permit satisfactory sexual activity for at least 3 months.&quot;

===Psychological impact===
ED often has an impact on the emotional well-being of both males and their partners. Many males do not seek treatment due to feelings of embarrassment. About 75% of diagnosed cases of ED go untreated.

==Causes==
Causes of or contributors to ED include the following:
* Diets high in saturated fat are linked to heart diseases, and males with heart diseases are more likely to experience ED. By contrast, plant-based diets show a lower risk for ED.
*Prescription drugs (e.g., SSRIs, beta blockers, antihistamines, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, thiazides, hormone modulators, and 5α-reductase inhibitors)
* Neurogenic disorders (e.g., diabetic neuropathy, temporal lobe epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, multiple system atrophy)
* Cavernosal disorders (e.g., Peyronie&#x27;s disease)
* Hyperprolactinemia (e.g., due to a prolactinoma)
* Psychological causes: performance anxiety, stress, and mental disorders
* Surgery (e.g., radical prostatectomy)
* Ageing: after age 40 years, ageing itself is a risk factor for ED, although numerous other pathologies that may occur with ageing, such as testosterone deficiency, cardiovascular diseases, or diabetes, among others, appear to have interacting effects
* Kidney disease: ED and chronic kidney disease have pathological mechanisms in common, including vascular and hormonal dysfunction, and may share other comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus that can contribute to ED
* Lifestyle habits, particularly smoking, which is a key risk factor for ED as it promotes arterial narrowing. Due to its propensity for causing detumescence and erectile dysfunction, some studies have described tobacco as an anaphrodisiacal substance.
*COVID-19: preliminary research indicates that COVID-19 viral infection may affect sexual and reproductive health.
Surgical intervention for a number of conditions may remove anatomical structures necessary to erection, damage nerves, or impair blood supply. ED is a common complication of treatments for prostate cancer, including prostatectomy and destruction of the prostate by external beam radiation, although the prostate gland itself is not necessary to achieve an erection. As far as inguinal hernia surgery is concerned, in most cases, and in the absence of postoperative complications, the operative repair can lead to a recovery of the sexual life of people with preoperative sexual dysfunction, while, in most cases, it does not affect people with a preoperative normal sexual life.

ED can also be associated with bicycling due to both neurological and vascular problems due to compression. The increased risk appears to be about 1.7-fold.

Concerns that use of pornography can cause ED have little support in epidemiological studies, according to a 2015 literature review. According to Gunter de Win, a Belgian professor and sex researcher, &quot;Put simply, respondents who watch 60 minutes a week and think they&#x27;re addicted were more likely to report sexual dysfunction than those who watch a care-free 160 minutes weekly.&quot;

In seemingly rare cases, medications such as SSRIs, isotretinoin (Accutane) and finasteride (Propecia) are reported to induce long-lasting iatrogenic disorders characterized by sexual dysfunction symptoms, including erectile dysfunction in males; these disorders are known as post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD), post-retinoid sexual dysfunction/post-Accutane syndrome (PRSD/PAS), and post-finasteride syndrome (PFS). These conditions remain poorly understood and lack effective treatments, although they have been suggested to share a common etiology.
* Rarely impotence can be caused by aromatase being active. See Androgen replacement therapy.

==Pathophysiology==
Penile erection is managed by two mechanisms: the reflex erection, which is achieved by directly touching the penile shaft, and the psychogenic erection, which is achieved by erotic or emotional stimuli. The former involves the peripheral nerves and the lower parts of the spinal cord, whereas the latter involves the limbic system of the brain. In both cases, an intact neural system is required for a successful and complete erection. Stimulation of the penile shaft by the nervous system leads to the secretion of nitric oxide (NO), which causes the relaxation of the smooth muscles of the corpora cavernosa (the main erectile tissue of the penis), and subsequently penile erection. Additionally, adequate levels of testosterone (produced by the testes) and an intact pituitary gland are required for the development of a healthy erectile system. As can be understood from the mechanisms of a normal erection, impotence may develop due to hormonal deficiency, disorders of the neural system, lack of adequate penile blood supply or psychological problems. 

==Diagnosis==
In many cases, the diagnosis can be made based on the person&#x27;s history of symptoms. In other cases, a physical examination and laboratory investigations are done to rule out more serious causes such as hypogonadism or prolactinoma.

One of the first steps is to distinguish between physiological and psychological ED. Determining whether involuntary erections are present is important in eliminating the possibility of psychogenic causes for ED. Obtaining full erections occasionally, such as nocturnal penile tumescence when asleep (that is, when the mind and psychological issues, if any, are less present), tends to suggest that the physical structures are functionally working. Similarly, performance with manual stimulation, as well as any performance anxiety or acute situational ED, may indicate a psychogenic component to ED.

Another factor leading to ED is diabetes mellitus, a well known cause of neuropathy. ED is also related to generally poor physical health, poor dietary habits, obesity, and most specifically cardiovascular disease, such as coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease. Screening for cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and alcoholism, is helpful.

In some cases, the simple search for a previously undetected groin hernia can prove useful since it can affect sexual functions in males and is relatively easily curable.

The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental diseases (DSM-IV) lists ED.

===Ultrasonography===

Penile ultrasonography with doppler can be used to examine the erect penis. Most cases of ED of organic causes are related to changes in blood flow in the corpora cavernosa, represented by occlusive artery disease (in which less blood is allowed to enter the penis), most often of atherosclerotic origin, or due to failure of the veno-occlusive mechanism (in which too much blood circulates back out of the penis). Before the Doppler sonogram, the penis should be examined in B mode, in order to identify possible tumors, fibrotic plaques, calcifications, or hematomas, and to evaluate the appearance of the cavernous arteries, which can be tortuous or atheromatous.

Erection can be induced by injecting 10–20 μg of prostaglandin E1, with evaluations of the arterial flow every five minutes for 25–30 min (see image). The use of prostaglandin E1 is contraindicated in patients with predisposition to priapism (e.g., those with sickle cell anemia), anatomical deformity of the penis, or penile implants. Phentolamine (2 mg) is often added. Visual and tactile stimulation produces better results. Some authors recommend the use of sildenafil by mouth to replace the injectable drugs in cases of contraindications, although the efficacy of such medication is controversial.

Before the injection of the chosen drug, the flow pattern is monophasic, with low systolic velocities and an absence of diastolic flow. After injection, systolic and diastolic peak velocities should increase, decreasing progressively with vein occlusion and becoming negative when the penis becomes rigid (see image below). The reference values vary across studies, ranging from &gt; 25 cm/s to &gt; 35 cm/s. Values above 35 cm/s indicate the absence of arterial disease, values below 25 cm/s indicate arterial insufficiency, and values of 25–35 cm/s are indeterminate because they are less specific (see image below). The data obtained should be correlated with the degree of erection observed. If the peak systolic velocities are normal, the final diastolic velocities should be evaluated, those above 5 cm/s being associated with venogenic ED.

===Other workup methods===
;Penile nerves function:Tests such as the bulbocavernosus reflex test are used to ascertain whether there is enough nerve sensation in the penis. The physician squeezes the glans (head) of the penis, which immediately causes the anus to contract if nerve function is normal. A physician measures the latency between squeeze and contraction by observing the anal sphincter or by feeling it with a gloved finger in the anus.

;Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT):It is normal for a man to have five to six erections during sleep, especially during rapid eye movement (REM). Their absence may indicate a problem with nerve function or blood supply in the penis. There are two methods for measuring changes in penile rigidity and circumference during nocturnal erection: snap gauge and strain gauge. A significant proportion of males who have no sexual dysfunction nonetheless do not have regular nocturnal erections.

;Penile biothesiometry:This test uses electromagnetic vibration to evaluate sensitivity and nerve function in the glans and shaft of the penis.

;Dynamic infusion cavernosometry (DICC):Technique in which fluid is pumped into the penis at a known rate and pressure. It gives a measurement of the vascular pressure in the corpus cavernosum during an erection.

;Corpus cavernosometry:Cavernosography measurement of the vascular pressure in the corpus cavernosum. Saline is infused under pressure into the corpus cavernosum with a butterfly needle, and the flow rate needed to maintain an erection indicates the degree of venous leakage. The leaking veins responsible may be visualized by infusing a mixture of saline and x-ray contrast medium and performing a cavernosogram. In Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), the images are acquired digitally.

;Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): This is similar to magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance angiography uses magnetic fields and radio waves to provide detailed images of the blood vessels. The doctor may inject into the patient&#x27;s bloodstream a contrast agent, which causes vascular tissues to stand out against other tissues, so that information about blood supply and vascular anomalies is easier to gather.

==Treatment==

Treatment depends on the underlying cause. In general, exercise, particularly of the aerobic type, is effective for preventing ED during midlife. Counseling can be used if the underlying cause is psychological, including how to lower stress or anxiety related to sex. Medications by mouth and vacuum erection devices are first-line treatments, followed by injections of drugs into the penis, as well as penile implants. Vascular reconstructive surgeries are beneficial in certain groups. Treatments, other than surgery, do not fix the underlying physiological problem, but are used as needed before sex.

===Medications===
The PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra) and tadalafil (Cialis) are prescription drugs which are taken by mouth. As of 2018, sildenafil is available in the UK without a prescription. Additionally, a cream combining alprostadil with the permeation enhancer DDAIP has been approved in Canada as a first line treatment for ED. Penile injections, on the other hand, can involve one of the following medications: papaverine, phentolamine, and prostaglandin E1, also known as alprostadil. In addition to injections, there is an alprostadil suppository that can be inserted into the urethra. Once inserted, an erection can begin within 10 minutes and last up to an hour. Medications to treat ED may cause a side effect called priapism.

====Prevalence of medical diagnosis====
In a study published in 2016, based on US health insurance claims data, out of 19,833,939 US males aged ≥18 years, only 1,108,842 (5.6%), were medically diagnosed with erectile dysfunction or on a PDE5I prescription (&quot;μ&quot; age 55.2 years, &quot;σ&quot; 11.2 years). Prevalence of diagnosis or prescription was the highest for age group 60–69 at 11.5%, lowest for age group 18–29 at 0.4%, and 2.1% for 30–39, 5.7% for 40–49, 10% for 50–59, 11% for 70–79, 4.6% for 80–89, 0.9% for ≥90, respectively.

===Focused shockwave therapy===
Focused shockwave therapy involves passing short, high frequency acoustic pulses through the skin and into the penis. These waves break down any plaques within the blood vessels, encourage the formation of new vessels, and stimulate repair and tissue regeneration.

Focused shockwave therapy appears to work best for males with vasculogenic ED, which is a blood vessel disorder that affects blood flow to tissue in the penis. The treatment is painless and has no known side effects. Treatment with shockwave therapy can lead to a significant improvement of the IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function).

=== Testosterone ===
Men with low levels of testosterone can experience ED. Taking testosterone may help maintain an erection. Males with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to have lower levels of testosterone, and are three times more likely to experience ED than non-diabetic men.

===Pumps===
A vacuum erection device helps draw blood into the penis by applying negative pressure. This type of device is sometimes referred to as penis pump and may be used just prior to sexual intercourse. Several types of FDA approved vacuum therapy devices are available under prescription. When pharmacological methods fail, a purpose-designed external vacuum pump can be used to attain erection, with a separate compression ring fitted to the base of the penis to maintain it. These pumps should be distinguished from other penis pumps (supplied without compression rings) which, rather than being used for temporary treatment of impotence, are claimed to increase penis length if used frequently, or vibrate as an aid to masturbation. More drastically, inflatable or rigid penile implants may be fitted surgically.

=== Vibrators ===
The vibrator was invented in the late 19th century as a medical instrument for pain relief and the treatment of various ailments. Sometimes described as a massager, the vibrator is used on the body to produce sexual stimulation. Several clinical studies have found vibrators to be an effective solution for Erectile Dysfunction. Examples of FDA registered vibrators for erectile dysfunction include MysteryVibe&#x27;s Tenuto and Reflexonic&#x27;s Viberect.

=== Surgery ===

Often, as a last resort, if other treatments have failed, the most common procedure is prosthetic implants which involves the insertion of artificial rods into the penis. Some sources show that vascular reconstructive surgeries are viable options for some people.

===Alternative medicine===
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recommend alternative therapies to treat sexual dysfunction. Many products are advertised as &quot;herbal viagra&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; sexual enhancement products, but no clinical trials or scientific studies support the effectiveness of these products for the treatment of ED, and synthetic chemical compounds similar to sildenafil have been found as adulterants in many of these products. The FDA has warned consumers that any sexual enhancement product that claims to work as well as prescription products is likely to contain such a contaminant. A 2021 review indicated that ginseng had &quot;only trivial effects on erectile function or satisfaction with intercourse compared to placebo&quot;.

==History==

Attempts to treat the symptoms described by ED date back well over 1,000 years. In the 8th century, males of Ancient Rome and Greece wore talismans of rooster and goat genitalia, believing these talismans would serve as an aphrodisiac and promote sexual function. In the 13th century, Albertus Magnus recommended ingesting roasted wolf penis as a remedy for impotence. During the late 16th and 17th centuries in France, male impotence was considered a crime, as well as legal grounds for a divorce. The practice, which involved inspection of the complainants by court experts, was declared obscene in 1677.

The first major publication describing a broad medicalization of sexual disorders was the first edition of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; in 1952. In the early 20th century, medical folklore held that 90-95% of cases of ED were psychological in origin, but around the 1980s research took the opposite direction of searching for physical causes of sexual dysfunction, which also happened in the 1920s and 30s. Physical causes as explanations continue to dominate literature when compared with psychological explanations . 

Treatments in the 80s for ED included penile implants and intracavernosal injections. The first successful vacuum erection device, or penis pump, was developed by Vincent Marie Mondat in the early 1800s. A more advanced device based on a bicycle pump was developed by Geddings Osbon, a Pentecostal preacher, in the 1970s. In 1982, he received FDA approval to market the product. John R. Brinkley initiated a boom in male impotence treatments in the U.S. in the 1920s and 1930s, with radio programs that recommended expensive goat gland implants and &quot;mercurochrome&quot; injections as the path to restored male virility, including operations by surgeon Serge Voronoff.

Modern drug therapy for ED made a significant advance in 1983, when British physiologist Giles Brindley dropped his trousers and demonstrated to a shocked Urodynamics Society audience showing his papaverine-induced erection. The current most common treatment for ED, the oral PDE5 inhibitor known as sildenafil (Viagra) was approved for use for Pfizer by the FDA in 1998, which at the time of release was the fastest selling drug in history. Sildenafil largely replaced SSRI treatments for ED at the time and proliferated new types of specialised pharmaceutical marketing which emphasised social connotations of ED and Viagra rather than its physical effects.

==Anthropology==
Anthropological research presents ED not as a disorder but, as a normal, and sometimes even welcome sign of healthy aging. Wentzell&#x27;s study of 250 Mexican males in their 50s and 60s found that &quot;most simply did not see decreasing erectile function as a biological pathology&quot;. The males interviewed described the decrease in erectile function &quot;as an aid for aging in socially appropriate ways&quot;. A common theme amongst the interviewees showed that respectable older males shifted their focus toward the domestic sphere into a &quot;second stage of life&quot;. The Mexican males of this generation often pursued sex outside of marriage; decreasing erectile function acted as an aid to overcoming infidelity thus helping to attain the ideal &quot;second stage&quot; of life. A 56-year-old about to retire from the public health service said he would now &quot;dedicate myself to my wife, the house, gardening, caring for the grandchildren—the Mexican classic&quot;. Wentzell found that treating ED as a pathology was antithetical to the social view these males held of themselves, and their purpose at this stage of their lives.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, anthropologists investigated how common treatments for ED are built upon assumptions of institutionalized social norms. In offering a range of clinical treatments to &#x27;correct&#x27; a person&#x27;s ability to produce an erection, biomedical institutions encourage the public to strive for prolonged sexual function. Anthropologists argue that a biomedical focus places emphasis on the biological processes of fixing the body thereby disregarding holistic ideals of health and aging. By relying on a wholly medical approach, Western biomedicine can become blindsided by bodily dysfunctions which can be understood as appropriate functions of age, and not as a medical problem. Anthropologists understand that a biosocial approach to ED considers a person&#x27;s decision to undergo clinical treatment more likely a result of &quot;society, political economy, history, and culture&quot; than a matter of personal choice. In rejecting biomedical treatment for ED, males can challenge common forms of medicalized social control by deviating from what is considered the normal approach to dysfunction.

==Lexicology==
The Latin term &quot;impotentia coeundi&quot; describes simple inability to insert the penis into the vagina; it is now mostly replaced by more precise terms, such as &quot;erectile dysfunction&quot; (ED). The study of ED within medicine is covered by andrology, a sub-field within urology. Research indicates that ED is common, and it is suggested that approximately 40% of males experience symptoms compatible with ED, at least occasionally. The condition is also on occasion called &quot;phallic impotence&quot;. Its antonym, or opposite condition, is priapism.

<doc id="14787" wikidata="Q273659" url="?curid=14787" title="Iran–Contra affair">
<text>The Iran–Contra affair (; ), also referred to as the Iran–Contra scandal, the Iran Initiative, or simply Iran–Contra, was a political scandal in the United States that centered around arms trafficking to Iran between 1981 to 1986, facilitated by senior officials of the Ronald Reagan administration. As Iran was subject to an arms embargo at the time of the scandal, the sale of arms was deemed illegal. The administration hoped to use the proceeds of the arms sale to fund the Contras, an anti-Sandinista rebel group in Nicaragua. Under the Boland Amendment, further funding of the Contras by legislative appropriations was prohibited by Congress, but the Reagan administration figured out a loophole by secretively using non-appropriated funds instead.

The administration&#x27;s justification for the arms shipments was that they were part of an attempt to free seven U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, an Islamist paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The idea to exchange arms for hostages was proposed by Manucher Ghorbanifar, an expatriate Iranian arms dealer. Some within the Reagan administration hoped the sales would influence Iran to get Hezbollah to release the hostages.

After the Lebanese magazine &quot;Ash-Shiraa&quot; reported on the weapon dealings in November 1986, it broke international news, causing Reagan to appear on national television. He claimed that while the weapons transfers had indeed occurred, the U.S. did not trade arms for hostages. The investigation was impeded when large volumes of documents relating to the affair were destroyed or withheld from investigators by Reagan administration officials. In March 1987, Reagan made a further nationally televised address, saying he was taking full responsibility for the affair and stating that &quot;what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages.&quot;

The affair was investigated by Congress and by the three-person, Reagan-appointed Tower Commission. Neither investigation found evidence that President Reagan himself knew of the extent of the multiple programs. Additionally, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lawrence Walsh was appointed independent counsel in December 1986 to investigate possible criminal actions by officials involved in the scheme. In the end, several dozen administration officials were indicted, including Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and Lieutenant colonel Oliver North. Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal. The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned in the final days of the presidency of George H. W. Bush, who had been vice president at the time of the affair. Former Independent Counsel Walsh noted that, in issuing the pardons, Bush appeared to have been preempting being implicated himself by evidence that came to light during the Weinberger trial and noted that there was a pattern of &quot;deception and obstruction&quot; by Bush, Weinberger, and other senior Reagan administration officials. Walsh submitted his final report on 4 August 1993 and later wrote an account of his experiences as counsel, &quot;Firewall: The Iran-Contra Conspiracy and Cover-Up&quot;.

==Background==
Prior to the Iranian Revolution, the U.S. was the largest seller of arms to Iran under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and the vast majority of the weapons that the Islamic Republic of Iran inherited in January 1979 were U.S.-made. To maintain this arsenal, Iran required a steady supply of spare parts to replace those broken and worn out.

In November 1979, after Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 Americans hostage, U.S. President Jimmy Carter imposed an arms embargo on Iran. In September 1980, Iraq invaded Iran and Iran desperately needed weapons and spare parts for its current weapons. After Ronald Reagan took office as president on 20 January 1981 and the hostages were released, he vowed to continue Carter&#x27;s policy of blocking arms sales to Iran on the grounds that Iran supported terrorism. However, a group of senior Reagan administration officials in the Senior Interdepartmental Group conducted a secret study on 21 July 1981 and concluded that the arms embargo was ineffective because Iran could always buy arms and spare parts for its U.S. weapons elsewhere, while, at the same time, the arms embargo opened the door for Iran to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence as the Kremlin could sell Iran weapons if the U.S. would not. The conclusion was that the U.S. should start selling Iran arms as soon as it was politically possible. This was made more difficult politically due to Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s openly declared goal of exporting his Islamic revolution all over the Middle East and overthrowing the governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the other states around the Persian Gulf, which led to the Americans perceiving Khomeini as a major threat to the U.S.

In the spring of 1983, the U.S. launched Operation Staunch, a wide-ranging diplomatic effort to persuade other nations all over the world not to sell arms or spare parts for weapons to Iran. This was at least part of the reason the Iran–Contra affair proved so humiliating for the U.S. when the story first broke in November 1986 that the U.S. itself was selling arms to Iran.

At the same time that the U.S. government was considering its options on selling arms to Iran, Contra militants based in Honduras were waging a guerrilla war to topple the FSLN revolutionary government of Nicaragua. Almost from the time he took office in 1981, a major goal of the Reagan administration was the overthrow of the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua and to support the Contra rebels.

The Reagan administration&#x27;s policy toward Nicaragua produced a major clash between the executive and legislative branches as Congress sought to limit, if not curb altogether, the ability of the White House to support the Contras. Direct U.S. funding of the Contras insurgency was made illegal through the Boland Amendment, the name given to three U.S. legislative amendments between 1982 and 1984 aimed at limiting U.S. government assistance to Contra militants. By 1984, funding for the Contras had run out; and, in October of that year, a total ban came into effect. The second Boland Amendment, in effect from 3 October 1984 to 3 December 1985, stated:During the fiscal year 1985 no funds available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose of or which may have the effect of supporting directly or indirectly military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by any nation, organization, group, movement, or individual. In violation of the Boland Amendment, senior officials of the Reagan administration continued to secretly arm and train the Contras and provide arms to Iran, an operation they called &quot;the Enterprise&quot;. Given the Contras&#x27; heavy dependence on U.S. military and financial support, the second Boland Amendment threatened to break the Contra movement and led to President Reagan ordering in 1984 that the NSC &quot;keep the Contras together &#x27;body and soul, no matter what Congress voted for.

A major legal debate at the center of the Iran–Contra affair concerned the question of whether the NSC was one of the &quot;any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities&quot; covered by the Boland Amendment. The Reagan administration argued it was not, and many in Congress argued that it was. The majority of constitutional scholars have asserted the NSC did indeed fall within the purview of the second Boland Amendment, though the amendment did not mention the NSC by name.

The broader constitutional question at stake was the power of Congress versus the power of the presidency. The Reagan administration argued that, because the constitution assigned the right to conduct foreign policy to the executive, its efforts to overthrow the government of Nicaragua were a presidential prerogative that Congress had no right to try to halt via the Boland Amendments. By contrast, Congressional leaders argued that the constitution had assigned Congress control of the budget, and Congress had every right to use that power not to fund projects they disapproved of, such as attempting to overthrow the government of Nicaragua.

As part of the effort to circumvent the Boland Amendment, the NSC established &quot;the Enterprise&quot;, an arms-smuggling network headed by a retired U.S. Air Force officer turned arms dealer Richard Secord that supplied arms to the Contras. It was ostensibly a private sector operation, but in fact was controlled by the NSC. To fund &quot;the Enterprise&quot;, the Reagan administration was constantly on the look-out for funds that came from outside the U.S. government, thus not technically violating the exact phrasing of the Amendment regardless of the money&#x27;s ultimate purpose. Ironically, military aid to the Contras was reinstated with Congressional consent in October 1986, a month before the scandal broke.

In his 1995 memoir &quot;My American Journey&quot;, General Colin Powell, the U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor, wrote that the weapons sales to Iran were used &quot;for purposes prohibited by the elected representatives of the American people [...] in a way that avoided accountability to the President and Congress. It was wrong.&quot;

In 1985, Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega offered to help the U.S. by allowing Panama as a staging ground for operations against the FSLN and offering to train Contras in Panama, but this would later be overshadowed by the Iran–Contra affair itself. At around the same time, the Soviet Bloc also engaged in arms deals with ideologically opponent buyers, possibly involving some of the same players as the Iran–Contra affair. In 1986, a complex operation involving East Germany&#x27;s Stasi and the Danish-registered ship &quot;Pia Vesta&quot; ultimately aimed to sell Soviet arms and military vehicles to South Africa&#x27;s Armscor, using various intermediaries to distance themselves from the deal. Noriega was apparently one of these intermediaries but backed out on the deal as the ship and weapons were seized at a Panamanian port. The &quot;Pia Vesta&quot; led to a small controversy, as the Panama and Peru governments in 1986 accused the U.S. and each other of being involved in the East Germany-originated shipment.

==Arms sales to Iran==

As reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1991, &quot;continuing allegations that Reagan campaign officials made a deal with the Iranian Government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the fall of 1980&quot; led to &quot;limited investigations&quot;. However &quot;limited&quot;, those investigations established that &quot;Soon after taking office in 1981, the Reagan Administration secretly and abruptly changed United States policy.&quot; Secret Israeli arms sales and shipments to Iran began in that year, even as, in public, &quot;the Reagan Administration&quot; presented a different face, and &quot;aggressively promoted a public campaign [...] to stop worldwide transfers of military goods to Iran&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; explains: &quot;Iran at that time was in dire need of arms and spare parts for its American-made arsenal to defend itself against Iraq, which had attacked it in September 1980&quot;, while &quot;Israel [a US ally] was interested in keeping the war between Iran and Iraq going to ensure that these two potential enemies remained preoccupied with each other&quot;. Major General Avraham Tamir, a high-ranking Israeli Defense Ministry official in 1981, said there was an &quot;oral agreement&quot; to allow the sale of &quot;spare parts&quot; to Iran. This was based on an &quot;understanding&quot; with Secretary of State Alexander Haig (which a Haig adviser denied). This account was confirmed by a former senior US diplomat with a few modifications. The diplomat claimed that &quot;[Ariel] Sharon violated it, and Haig backed away&quot;. A former &quot;high-level&quot; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official who saw reports of arms sales to Iran by Israel in the early 1980s estimated that the total was about $2 billion a year—but also said, &quot;The degree to which it was sanctioned I don&#x27;t know.&quot;

On 17 June 1985, National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane wrote a National Security Decision Directive which called for the US to begin a rapprochement with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The paper read:

Dynamic political evolution is taking place inside Iran. Instability caused by the pressures of the Iraq-Iran war, economic deterioration and regime in-fighting create the potential for major changes inside Iran. The Soviet Union is better positioned than the U.S. to exploit and benefit from any power struggle that results in changes from the Iranian regime [...]. The U.S. should encourage Western allies and friends to help Iran meet its import requirements so as to reduce the attractiveness of Soviet assistance [...]. This includes provision of selected military equipment.

Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was highly negative, writing on his copy of McFarlane&#x27;s paper: &quot;This is almost too absurd to comment on [...] like asking Qaddafi to Washington for a cozy chat.&quot; Secretary of State George Shultz was also opposed, stating that having designated Iran a State Sponsor of Terrorism in January 1984, how could the US possibly sell arms to Iran? Only the Director of the CIA William J. Casey supported McFarlane&#x27;s plan to start selling arms to Iran.

In early July 1985, the historian Michael Ledeen, a consultant of National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, requested assistance from Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres for help in the sale of arms to Iran. Having talked to an Israeli diplomat David Kimche and Ledeen, McFarlane learned that the Iranians were prepared to have Hezbollah release US hostages in Lebanon in exchange for Israelis shipping Iran US weapons. Having been designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism since January 1984, Iran was in the midst of the Iran–Iraq War and could find few Western nations willing to supply it with weapons. The idea behind the plan was for Israel to ship weapons through an intermediary (identified as Manucher Ghorbanifar) to the Islamic Republic as a way of aiding a supposedly moderate, politically influential faction within the regime of Ayatollah Khomeini who was believed to be seeking a rapprochement with the US; after the transaction, the US would reimburse Israel with the same weapons, while receiving monetary benefits. McFarlane in a memo to Shultz and Weinberger wrote:

The short term dimension concerns the seven hostages; the long term dimension involves the establishment of a private dialogue with Iranian officials on the broader relations [...]. They sought specifically the delivery from Israel of 100 TOW missiles [...].

The plan was discussed with President Reagan on 18 July 1985 and again on 6 August 1985. Shultz at the latter meeting warned Reagan that &quot;we were just falling into the arms-for-hostages business and we shouldn&#x27;t do it&quot;.

The Americans believed that there was a moderate faction in the Islamic Republic headed by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the powerful speaker of the &quot;Majlis&quot; who was seen as a leading potential successor to Khomeini and who was alleged to want a rapprochement with the US. The Americans believed that Rafsanjani had the power to order Hezbollah to free the US hostages and establishing a relationship with him by selling Iran arms would ultimately place Iran back within the US sphere of influence. It remains unclear if Rafsanjani really wanted a rapprochement with the US or was just deceiving Reagan administration officials who were willing to believe that he was a moderate who would effect a rapprochement. Rafsanjani, whose nickname is &quot;the Shark&quot;, was described by the UK journalist Patrick Brogan as a man of great charm and formidable intelligence known for his subtlety and ruthlessness whose motives in the Iran–Contra affair remain completely mysterious. The Israeli government required that the sale of arms meet high-level approval from the US government, and, when McFarlane convinced them that the US government approved the sale, Israel obliged by agreeing to sell the arms.

In 1985, President Reagan entered Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for colon cancer surgery. Reagan&#x27;s recovery was nothing short of miserable, as the 74-year-old President admitted having little sleep for days in addition to his immense physical discomfort. While doctors seemed to be confident that the surgery was successful, the discovery of his localized cancer was a daunting realization for Reagan. From seeing the recovery process of other patients, as well as medical “experts” on television predicting his death to be soon, Reagan&#x27;s typical optimistic outlook was dampened. These factors were bound to contribute to psychological distress in the midst of an already distressing situation. Additionally, Reagan&#x27;s invocation of the 25th Amendment prior to the surgery was a risky and unprecedented decision that smoothly flew under the radar for the duration of the complex situation. While it only lasted slightly longer than the length of the procedure (approximately seven hours and 54 minutes), this temporary transfer of power was never formally recognized by the White House. It was later revealed that this decision was made on the grounds that &quot;Mr. Reagan and his advisors did not want his actions to establish a definition of incapacitation that would bind future presidents.&quot; Reagan expressed this transfer of power in two identical letters that were sent to the speaker of the House of Representatives, Representative Tip O&#x27;Neill, and the president pro tempore of the senate, Senator Strom Thurmond.

While the President was recovering in the hospital, McFarlane met with him and told him that representatives from Israel had contacted the National Security Agency to pass on confidential information from what Reagan later described as the &quot;moderate&quot; Iranian faction headed by Rafsanjani opposed to the Ayatollah&#x27;s hardline anti-US policies. The visit from McFarlane in Reagan&#x27;s hospital room was the first visit from an administration official outside of Donald Regan since the surgery. The meeting took place five days after the surgery and only three days after doctors gave the news that his polyp had been malignant. The three participants of this meeting had very different recollections of what was discussed during its 23-minute duration. Months later, Reagan even stated that he &quot;had no recollection of a meeting in the hospital in July with McFarlane and that he had no notes which would show such a meeting&quot;. This does not come as a surprise considering the possible short and long-term effects of anesthesia on patients above the age of 60, in addition to his already weakened physical and mental state.

According to Reagan, these Iranians sought to establish a quiet relationship with the US, before establishing formal relationships upon the death of the aging Ayatollah. In Reagan&#x27;s account, McFarlane told Reagan that the Iranians, to demonstrate their seriousness, offered to persuade the Hezbollah militants to release the seven US hostages. McFarlane met with the Israeli intermediaries; Reagan claimed that he allowed this because he believed that establishing relations with a strategically located country, and preventing the Soviet Union from doing the same, was a beneficial move. Although Reagan claims that the arms sales were to a &quot;moderate&quot; faction of Iranians, the Walsh Iran–Contra Report states that the arms sales were &quot;to Iran&quot; itself, which was under the control of the Ayatollah.

Following the Israeli–US meeting, Israel requested permission from the US to sell a small number of BGM-71 TOW antitank missiles to Iran, claiming that this would aid the &quot;moderate&quot; Iranian faction, by demonstrating that the group actually had high-level connections to the US government. Reagan initially rejected the plan, until Israel sent information to the US showing that the &quot;moderate&quot; Iranians were opposed to terrorism and had fought against it. Now having a reason to trust the &quot;moderates&quot;, Reagan approved the transaction, which was meant to be between Israel and the &quot;moderates&quot; in Iran, with the US reimbursing Israel. In his 1990 autobiography &quot;An American Life&quot;, Reagan claimed that he was deeply committed to securing the release of the hostages; it was this compassion that supposedly motivated his support for the arms initiatives. The president requested that the &quot;moderate&quot; Iranians do everything in their capability to free the hostages held by Hezbollah. Reagan always publicly insisted after the scandal broke in late 1986 that the purpose behind the arms-for-hostages trade was to establish a working relationship with the &quot;moderate&quot; faction associated with Rafsanjani to facilitate the reestablishment of the US–Iranian alliance after the soon to be expected death of Khomeini, to end the Iran–Iraq War and end Iranian support for Islamic terrorism while downplaying the importance of freeing the hostages in Lebanon as a secondary issue. By contrast, when testifying before the Tower Commission, Reagan declared that hostage issue was the main reason for selling arms to Iran.
The following arms were supplied to Iran:
* First arms sales in 1981 (see above)
* 20 August 1985 – 96 TOW antitank missiles

===First few arms sales===
The first arms sales to Iran began in 1981, though the official paper trail has them beginning in 1985 (see above). On 20 August 1985, Israel sent 96 US-made TOW missiles to Iran through an arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar. Subsequently, on 14 September 1985, 408 more TOW missiles were delivered. On 15 September 1985, following the second delivery, Reverend Benjamin Weir was released by his captors, the Islamic Jihad Organization. On 24 November 1985, 18 Hawk antiaircraft missiles were delivered.

===Modifications in plans===
Robert McFarlane resigned on 4 December 1985, stating that he wanted to spend more time with his family, and was replaced by Admiral John Poindexter. Two days later, Reagan met with his advisors at the White House, where a new plan was introduced. This called for a slight change in the arms transactions: instead of the weapons going to the &quot;moderate&quot; Iranian group, they would go to &quot;moderate&quot; Iranian army leaders. As each weapons delivery was made from Israel by air, hostages held by Hezbollah would be released. Israel would continue to be reimbursed by the US for the weapons. Though staunchly opposed by Secretary of State George Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, the plan was authorized by Reagan, who stated that, &quot;We were trading arms for hostages, nor were we negotiating with terrorists&quot;. In his notes of a meeting held in the White House on 7 December 1985, Weinberger wrote he told Reagan that this plan was illegal, writing: I argued strongly that we have an embargo that makes arms sales to Iran illegal and President couldn&#x27;t violate it and that &#x27;washing&#x27; transactions through Israel wouldn&#x27;t make it legal. Shultz, Don Regan agreed. Weinberger&#x27;s notes have Reagan saying he &quot;could of illegality but he couldn&#x27;t that &#x27;big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to &#x27;.&quot; Now retired National Security Advisor McFarlane flew to London to meet with Israelis and Ghorbanifar in an attempt to persuade the Iranian to use his influence to release the hostages before any arms transactions occurred; this plan was rejected by Ghorbanifar.

On the day of McFarlane&#x27;s resignation, Oliver North, a military aide to the US National Security Council (NSC), proposed a new plan for selling arms to Iran, which included two major adjustments: instead of selling arms through Israel, the sale was to be direct at a markup; and a portion of the proceeds would go to the Contras, Nicaraguan paramilitary fighters waging guerrilla warfare against the Sandinista government, claiming power after an election full of irregularities. The dealings with the Iranians were conducted via the NSC with Admiral Poindexter and his deputy Colonel North, with the US historians Malcolm Byrne and Peter Kornbluh writing that Poindexter granted much power to North &quot;who made the most of the situation, often deciding important matters on his own, striking outlandish deals with the Iranians, and acting in the name of the president on issues that were far beyond his competence. All of these activities continued to take place within the framework of the president&#x27;s broad authorization. Until the press reported on the existence of the operation, nobody in the administration questioned the authority of Poindexter&#x27;s and North&#x27;s team to implement the president&#x27;s decisions&quot;. North proposed a $15 million markup, while contracted arms broker Ghorbanifar added a 41-percent markup of his own. Other members of the NSC were in favor of North&#x27;s plan; with large support, Poindexter authorized it without notifying President Reagan, and it went into effect. At first, the Iranians refused to buy the arms at the inflated price because of the excessive markup imposed by North and Ghorbanifar. They eventually relented, and, in February 1986, 1,000 TOW missiles were shipped to the country. From May to November 1986, there were additional shipments of miscellaneous weapons and parts.

Both the sale of weapons to Iran and the funding of the Contras attempted to circumvent not only stated administration policy, but also the Boland Amendment. Administration officials argued that, regardless of Congress restricting funds for the Contras, or any affair, the President (or in this case the administration) could carry on by seeking alternative means of funding such as private entities and foreign governments. Funding from one foreign country, Brunei, was botched when North&#x27;s secretary, Fawn Hall, transposed the numbers of North&#x27;s Swiss bank account number. A Swiss businessperson, suddenly $10 million richer, alerted the authorities of the mistake. The money was eventually returned to the Sultan of Brunei, with interest.

On 7 January 1986, John Poindexter proposed to Reagan a modification of the approved plan: instead of negotiating with the &quot;moderate&quot; Iranian political group, the US would negotiate with &quot;moderate&quot; members of the Iranian government. Poindexter told Reagan that Ghorbanifar had important connections within the Iranian government, so, with the hope of the release of the hostages, Reagan approved this plan as well. Throughout February 1986, weapons were shipped directly to Iran by the US (as part of Oliver North&#x27;s plan), but none of the hostages were released. Retired National Security Advisor McFarlane conducted another international voyage, this one to Tehran—bringing with him a gift of a Bible with a handwritten inscription by Ronald Reagan and, according to George W. Cave, a cake baked in the shape of a key. Howard Teicher described the cake as a joke between North and Ghorbanifar. McFarlane met directly with Iranian officials associated with Rafsanjani, who sought to establish US–Iranian relations in an attempt to free the four remaining hostages.

The US delegation comprised McFarlane, North, Cave (a retired CIA officer who served as the group&#x27;s translator), Teicher, Israeli diplomat Amiram Nir, and a CIA communicator. They arrived in Tehran in an Israeli plane carrying forged Irish passports on 25 May 1986. This meeting also failed. Much to McFarlane&#x27;s disgust, he did not meet ministers, and instead met in his words &quot;third and fourth level officials&quot;. At one point, an angry McFarlane shouted: &quot;As I am a Minister, I expect to meet with decision-makers. Otherwise, you can work with my staff.&quot; The Iranians requested concessions such as Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which the US rejected. More importantly, McFarlane refused to ship spare parts for the Hawk missiles until the Iranians had Hezbollah release the US hostages, whereas the Iranians wanted to reverse that sequence with the spare parts being shipped first before the hostages were freed. The differing negotiating positions led to McFarlane&#x27;s mission going home after four days. After the failure of the secret visit to Tehran, McFarlane advised Reagan not to talk to the Iranians anymore, advice that was disregarded.

===Subsequent dealings===
On 26 July 1986, Hezbollah freed the US hostage Father Lawrence Jenco, former head of Catholic Relief Services in Lebanon. Following this, William J. Casey, head of the CIA, requested that the US authorize sending a shipment of small missile parts to Iranian military forces as a way of expressing gratitude. Casey also justified this request by stating that the contact in the Iranian government might otherwise lose face or be executed, and hostages might be killed. Reagan authorized the shipment to ensure that those potential events would not occur. North used this release to persuade Reagan to switch over to a &quot;sequential&quot; policy of freeing the hostages one by one, instead of the &quot;all or nothing&quot; policy that the Americans had pursued until then. By this point, the Americans had grown tired of Ghorbanifar who had proven himself a dishonest intermediary who played off both sides to his own commercial advantage. In August 1986, the Americans had established a new contact in the Iranian government, Ali Hashemi Bahramani, the nephew of Rafsanjani and an officer in the Revolutionary Guard. The fact that the Revolutionary Guard was deeply involved in international terrorism seemed only to attract the Americans more to Bahramani, who was seen as someone with the influence to change Iran&#x27;s policies. Richard Secord, a US arms dealer, who was being used as a contact with Iran, wrote to North: &quot;My judgment is that we have opened up a new and probably better channel into Iran&quot;. North was so impressed with Bahramani that he arranged for him to secretly visit Washington DC and gave him a guided tour at midnight of the White House.

North frequently met with Bahramani in the summer and autumn of 1986 in West Germany, discussing arms sales to Iran, the freeing of hostages held by Hezbollah and how best to overthrow President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and the establishment of &quot;a non-hostile regime in Baghdad&quot;. In September and October 1986, three more Americans—Frank Reed, Joseph Cicippio, and Edward Tracy—were abducted in Lebanon by a separate terrorist group, who referred to them simply as &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, after the popular US toy. The reasons for their abduction are unknown, although it is speculated that they were kidnapped to replace the freed Americans. One more original hostage, David Jacobsen, was later released. The captors promised to release the remaining two, but the release never happened.

During a secret meeting in Frankfurt in October 1986, North told Bahramani that: &quot;Saddam Hussein must go&quot;. North also claimed that Reagan had told him to tell Bahramani that: &quot;Saddam Hussein is an asshole.&quot; Behramani during a secret meeting in Mainz informed North that Rafsanjani &quot;for his own politics [...] decided to get all the groups involved and give them a role to play&quot;. Thus, all the factions in the Iranian government would be jointly responsible for the talks with the Americans and &quot;there would not be an internal war&quot;. This demand of Behramani caused much dismay on the US side as it made clear to them that they would not be dealing solely with a &quot;moderate&quot; faction in the Islamic Republic but rather with all the factions in the Iranian government—including those who were very much involved in terrorism. Despite this, the talks were not broken off.

==Discovery and scandal==

After a leak by Mehdi Hashemi, a senior official in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Lebanese magazine &quot;Ash-Shiraa&quot; exposed the arrangement on 3 November 1986. According to Seymour Hersh, an unnamed former military officer told him that the leak may have been orchestrated by a covert team led by Arthur S. Moreau Jr., assistant to the chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, due to fears the scheme had grown out of control.

This was the first public report of the weapons-for-hostages deal. The operation was discovered only after an airlift of guns (Corporate Air Services HPF821) was downed over Nicaragua. Eugene Hasenfus, who was captured by Nicaraguan authorities after surviving the plane crash, initially alleged in a press conference on Nicaraguan soil that two of his coworkers, Max Gomez and Ramon Medina, worked for the CIA. He later said he did not know whether they did or not. The Iranian government confirmed the &quot;Ash-Shiraa&quot; story, and, 10 days after the story was first published, President Reagan appeared on national television from the Oval Office on 13 November, stating:

My purpose was [...] to send a signal that the United States was prepared to replace the animosity between [the US and Iran] with a new relationship [...]. At the same time we undertook this initiative, we made clear that Iran must oppose all forms of international terrorism as a condition of progress in our relationship. The most significant step which Iran could take, we indicated, would be to use its influence in Lebanon to secure the release of all hostages held there.

The scandal was compounded when Oliver North destroyed or hid pertinent documents between 21 November and 25 November 1986. During North&#x27;s trial in 1989, his secretary, Fawn Hall, testified extensively about helping North alter and shred official US National Security Council (NSC) documents from the White House. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, enough documents were put into a government shredder to jam it. Hall also testified that she smuggled classified documents out of the Old Executive Office Building by concealing them in her boots and dress. North&#x27;s explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved in Iran and Contra operations. It was not until 1993, years after the trial, that North&#x27;s notebooks were made public, and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of the Independent Counsel under the Freedom of Information Act.

During the trial, North testified that on 21, 22 or 24 November, he witnessed Poindexter destroy what may have been the only signed copy of a presidential covert-action finding that sought to authorize CIA participation in the November 1985 Hawk missile shipment to Iran. U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese admitted on 25 November that profits from weapons sales to Iran were made available to assist the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. On the same day, John Poindexter resigned, and President Reagan fired Oliver North. Poindexter was replaced by Frank Carlucci on 2 December 1986.

When the story broke, many legal and constitutional scholars expressed dismay that the NSC, which was supposed to be just an advisory body to assist the President with formulating foreign policy, had &quot;gone operational&quot; by becoming an executive body covertly executing foreign policy on its own. The National Security Act of 1947, which created the NSC, gave it the vague right to perform &quot;such other functions and duties related to the intelligence as the National Security Council may from time to time direct.&quot; However, the NSC had usually, although not always, acted as an advisory agency until the Reagan administration when the NSC had &quot;gone operational&quot;, a situation that was condemned by both the Tower Commission and by Congress as a departure from the norm. The American historian John Canham-Clyne asserted that the Iran–Contra affair and the NSC &quot;going operational&quot; were not departures from the norm, but were the logical and natural consequence of the existence of the &quot;national security state&quot;, the plethora of shadowy government agencies with multi-million dollar budgets operating with little oversight from Congress, the courts or the media, and for whom upholding national security justified almost everything. Canham-Clyne argued that for the &quot;national security state&quot;, the law was an obstacle to be surmounted rather than something to uphold and that the Iran–Contra affair was just &quot;business as usual&quot;, something he asserted that the media missed by focusing on the NSC having &quot;gone operational.&quot;

In &quot;Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981–1987&quot;, journalist Bob Woodward chronicled the role of the CIA in facilitating the transfer of funds from the Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras spearheaded by Oliver North. According to Woodward, then-Director of the CIA William J. Casey admitted to him in February 1987 that he was aware of the diversion of funds to the Contras. The controversial admission occurred while Casey was hospitalized for a stroke, and, according to his wife, was unable to communicate. On 6 May 1987, William Casey died the day after Congress began public hearings on Iran–Contra. Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh later wrote: &quot;Independent Counsel obtained no documentary evidence showing Casey knew about or approved the diversion. The only direct testimony linking Casey to early knowledge of the diversion came from [Oliver] North.&quot; Gust Avrakodos, who was responsible for the arms supplies to the Afghans at this time, was aware of the operation as well and strongly opposed it, in particular the diversion of funds allotted to the Afghan operation. According to his Middle Eastern experts, the operation was pointless because the moderates in Iran were not in a position to challenge the fundamentalists. However, he was overruled by Clair George.

==Tower Commission==

On 25 November 1986, President Reagan announced the creation of a Special Review Board to look into the matter; the following day, he appointed former Senator John Tower, former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, and former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to serve as members. This Presidential Commission took effect on 1 December and became known as the Tower Commission. The main objectives of the commission were to inquire into &quot;the circumstances surrounding the Iran–Contra matter, other case studies that might reveal strengths and weaknesses in the operation of the National Security Council system under stress, and the manner in which that system has served eight different presidents since its inception in 1947&quot;. The Tower Commission was the first presidential commission to review and evaluate the National Security Council.

President Reagan appeared before the Tower Commission on 2 December 1986, to answer questions regarding his involvement in the affair. When asked about his role in authorizing the arms deals, he first stated that he had; later, he appeared to contradict himself by stating that he had no recollection of doing so. In his 1990 autobiography, &quot;An American Life&quot;, Reagan acknowledges authorizing the shipments to Israel.

The report published by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on 26 February 1987. The commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, and two of the arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more power in the hands of that chair.

==Congressional committees investigating the affair==

In January 1987, Congress announced it was opening an investigation into the Iran–Contra affair. Depending upon one&#x27;s political perspective, the Congressional investigation into the Iran–Contra affair was either an attempt by the legislative arm to gain control over an out-of-control executive arm, a partisan &quot;witch hunt&quot; by the Democrats against a Republican administration or a feeble effort by Congress that did far too little to rein in the &quot;imperial presidency&quot; that had run amok by breaking numerous laws. The Democratic-controlled United States Congress issued its own report on 18 November 1987, stating that &quot;If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have.&quot; The Congressional report wrote that the president bore &quot;ultimate responsibility&quot; for wrongdoing by his aides, and his administration exhibited &quot;secrecy, deception and disdain for the law&quot;. It also read that &quot;the central remaining question is the role of the President in the Iran–Contra affair. On this critical point, the shredding of documents by Poindexter, North and others, and the death of Casey, leave the record incomplete&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Reagan expressed regret with regard to the situation in a nationally televised address from the Oval Office on 4 March 1987, and in two other speeches. Reagan had not spoken to the American people directly for three months amidst the scandal, and he offered the following explanation for his silence:

The reason I haven&#x27;t spoken to you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as frustrating as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper to come to you with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There&#x27;s been enough of that.

Reagan then took full responsibility for the acts committed:
First, let me say I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my administration. As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I&#x27;m still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior.

Finally, the president acknowledged that his previous assertions that the U.S. did not trade arms for hostages were incorrect:
A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that&#x27;s true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.

Reagan&#x27;s role in these transactions is still not definitively known. It is unclear exactly what Reagan knew and when, and whether the arms sales were motivated by his desire to save the U.S. hostages. Oliver North wrote that &quot;Ronald Reagan knew of and approved a great deal of what went on with both the Iranian initiative and private efforts on behalf of the contras and he received regular, detailed briefings on both...I have no doubt that he was told about the use of residuals for the Contras, and that he approved it. Enthusiastically.&quot; Handwritten notes by Defense Secretary Weinberger indicate that the President was aware of potential hostage transfers with Iran, as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to what he was told were &quot;moderate elements&quot; within Iran. Notes taken by Weinberger on 7 December 1985 record that Reagan said that &quot;he could of illegality but he couldn&#x27;t that &#x27;big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to . The Republican-written &quot;Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair&quot; made the following conclusion: There is some question and dispute about precisely the level at which he chose to follow the operation details. There is no doubt, however, ... [that] the President set the US policy towards Nicaragua, with few if any ambiguities, and then left subordinates more or less free to implement it.Domestically, the affair precipitated a drop in President Reagan&#x27;s popularity. His approval ratings suffered &quot;the largest single drop for any U.S. president in history&quot;, from 67% to 46% in November 1986, according to a &quot;New York Times&quot;/CBS News poll. The &quot;Teflon President&quot;, as Reagan was nicknamed by critics, survived the affair, however, and his approval rating recovered.

Internationally, the damage was more severe. Magnus Ranstorp wrote, &quot;U.S. willingness to engage in concessions with Iran and the Hezbollah not only signaled to its adversaries that hostage-taking was an extremely useful instrument in extracting political and financial concessions for the West but also undermined any credibility of U.S. criticism of other states&#x27; deviation from the principles of no-negotiation and no concession to terrorists and their demands.&quot;

In Iran, Mehdi Hashemi, the leaker of the scandal, was executed in 1987, allegedly for activities unrelated to the scandal. Though Hashemi made a full video confession to numerous serious charges, some observers find the coincidence of his leak and the subsequent prosecution highly suspicious.

In 1994, just five years after leaving office, President Reagan announced that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Lawrence Walsh, who was appointed Independent Counsel in 1986 to investigate the transactions later implied Reagan&#x27;s declining health may have played a role in his handling of the situation. However, Walsh did note that he believed President Reagan&#x27;s &quot;instincts for the country&#x27;s good were right&quot;.

===Indictments===

* Caspar Weinberger, Secretary of Defense, was indicted on two counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice on 16 June 1992. However, he was pardoned by George H. W. Bush on 24 December 1992, before he could be tried.
* Robert C. McFarlane, National Security Adviser, convicted of withholding evidence, but after a plea bargain was given only two years of probation. Later pardoned by President George H. W. Bush.
* Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State, convicted of withholding evidence, but after a plea bargain was given only two years probation. Later pardoned by President George H. W. Bush.
* Alan D. Fiers, Chief of the CIA&#x27;s Central American Task Force, convicted of withholding evidence and sentenced to one year probation. Later pardoned by President George H. W. Bush.
* Clair George, Chief of Covert Ops-CIA, convicted on two charges of perjury, but pardoned by President George H. W. Bush before sentencing.
* Oliver North, member of the National Security Council was indicted on 16 charges. A jury convicted him of accepting an illegal gratuity, obstruction of a Congressional inquiry, and destruction of documents. The convictions were overturned on appeal because his Fifth Amendment rights may have been violated by use of his immunized public testimony and because the judge had incorrectly explained the crime of destruction of documents to the jury.
* Fawn Hall, Oliver North&#x27;s secretary, was given immunity from prosecution on charges of conspiracy and destroying documents in exchange for her testimony.
* Jonathan Scott Royster, Liaison to Oliver North, was given immunity from prosecution on charges of conspiracy and destroying documents in exchange for his testimony.
* National Security Advisor John Poindexter was convicted of five counts of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, perjury, defrauding the government, and the alteration and destruction of evidence. A panel of the D.C. Circuit overturned the convictions on 15 November 1991 for the same reason the court had overturned Oliver North&#x27;s, and by the same 2 to 1 vote. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case.
* Duane Clarridge. An ex-CIA senior official, he was indicted in November 1991 on seven counts of perjury and false statements relating to a November 1985 shipment to Iran. Pardoned before trial by President George H. W. Bush.
* Richard V. Secord. Former Air Force major general, who was involved in arms transfers to Iran and diversion of funds to Contras, he pleaded guilty in November 1989 to making false statements to Congress and was sentenced to two years of probation. As part of his plea bargain, Secord agreed to provide further truthful testimony in exchange for the dismissal of remaining criminal charges against him.
* Albert Hakim. A businessman, he pleaded guilty in November 1989 to supplementing the salary of North by buying a $13,800 fence for North with money from &quot;the Enterprise,&quot; which was a set of foreign companies Hakim used in Iran–Contra. In addition, Swiss company Lake Resources Inc., used for storing money from arms sales to Iran to give to the Contras, plead guilty to stealing government property. Hakim was given two years of probation and a $5,000 fine, while Lake Resources Inc. was ordered to dissolve.
* Thomas G. Clines. A former CIA clandestine service officer. According to Special Prosecutor Walsh, he earned nearly $883,000 helping retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim carry out the secret operations of &quot;the Enterprise&quot;. He was indicted for concealing the full amount of his Enterprise profits for the 1985 and 1986 tax years, and for failing to declare his foreign financial accounts. He was convicted and served 16 months in prison, the only Iran–Contra defendant to have served a prison sentence.

The Independent Counsel, Lawrence E. Walsh, chose not to re-try North or Poindexter. In total, several dozen people were investigated by Walsh&#x27;s office.

===George H. W. Bush&#x27;s involvement===
On 27 July 1986, Israeli counterterrorism expert Amiram Nir briefed Vice President Bush in Jerusalem about the weapon sales to Iran.

In an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in August 1987, Bush stated that he was denied information about the operation and did not know about the diversion of funds. Bush said that he had not advised Reagan to reject the initiative because he had not heard strong objections to it. The &quot;Post&quot; quoted him as stating, &quot;We were not in the loop.&quot; The following month, Bush recounted meeting Nir in his September 1987 autobiography &quot;Looking Forward&quot;, stating that he began to develop misgivings about the Iran initiative. He wrote that he did not learn the full extent of the Iran dealings until he was briefed by Senator David Durenberger regarding a Senate inquiry into them. Bush added the briefing with Durenberger left him with the feeling he had &quot;been deliberately excluded from key meetings involving details of the Iran operation&quot;.

In January 1988 during a live interview with Bush on &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, Dan Rather told Bush that his unwillingness to speak about the scandal led &quot;people to say &#x27;either George Bush was irrelevant or he was ineffective, he set himself outside of the loop. Bush replied, &quot;May I explain what I mean by &#x27;out of the loop&#x27;? No operational role.&quot;

Although Bush publicly insisted that he knew little about the operation, his statements were contradicted by excerpts of his diary released by the White House in January 1993. An entry dated 5 November 1986 stated: &quot;On the news at this time is the question of the hostages... I&#x27;m one of the few people that know fully the details, and there is a lot of flak and misinformation out there. It is not a subject we can talk about...&quot;

===Pardons===
On 24 December 1992, after he had been defeated for reelection, President George H. W. Bush pardoned five administration officials who had been found guilty on charges relating to the affair. They were: 
# Elliott Abrams; 
# Duane Clarridge;
# Alan Fiers;
# Clair George; and
# Robert McFarlane.

Bush also pardoned Caspar Weinberger, who had not yet come to trial. Attorney General William P. Barr advised the President on these pardons, especially that of Caspar Weinberger.

In response to these Bush pardons, Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who headed the investigation of Reagan administration officials&#x27; criminal conduct in the Iran–Contra scandal, stated that &quot;the Iran-contra cover-up, which has continued for more than six years, has now been completed.&quot; Walsh noted that in issuing the pardons Bush appears to have been preempting being implicated himself in the crimes of Iran–Contra by evidence that was to come to light during the Weinberger trial, and noted that there was a pattern of &quot;deception and obstruction&quot; by Bush, Weinberger and other senior Reagan administration officials.

=== Modern interpretations ===
The Iran–Contra affair and the ensuing deception to protect senior administration officials (including President Reagan) was cast as an example of post-truth politics by Malcolm Byrne of George Washington University.

==Reports and documents==
The 100th Congress formed a Joint Committee of the United States Congress (Congressional committees investigating the Iran–Contra affair) and held hearings in mid-1987. Transcripts were published as: &quot;Iran-Contra Investigation: Joint Hearings Before the Senate Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan Opposition and the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran&quot; (U.S. GPO 1987–88). A closed Executive Session heard classified testimony from North and Poindexter; this transcript was published in a redacted format. The joint committee&#x27;s final report was &quot;Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair With Supplemental, Minority, and Additional Views&quot; (U.S. GPO 17 November 1987). The records of the committee are at the National Archives, but many are still non-public.

Testimony was also heard before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and can be found in the Congressional Record for those bodies. The Senate Intelligence Committee produced two reports: &quot;Preliminary Inquiry into the Sale of Arms to Iran and Possible Diversion of Funds to the Nicaraguan Resistance&quot; (2 February 1987) and &quot;Were Relevant Documents Withheld from the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair?&quot; (June 1989).

The Tower Commission Report was published as the &quot;Report of the President&#x27;s Special Review Board&quot; (U.S. GPO 26 February 1987). It was also published as &quot;The Tower Commission Report&quot; by Bantam Books ().

The Office of Independent Counsel/Walsh investigation produced four interim reports to Congress. Its final report was published as the &quot;Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran/Contra Matters&quot;. Walsh&#x27;s records are available at the National Archives.

<text>Infocom was an American software company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that produced numerous works of interactive fiction. They also produced a business application, a relational database called &quot;Cornerstone&quot;.

Infocom was founded on June 22, 1979, by staff and students of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and lasted as an independent company until 1986, when it was bought by Activision. Activision shut down the Infocom division in 1989, although they released some titles in the 1990s under the Infocom &quot;Zork&quot; brand. Activision abandoned the Infocom trademark in 2002.

==Overview==
Infocom games are text adventures where users direct the action by entering short strings of words to give commands when prompted. Generally the program will respond by describing the results of the action, often the contents of a room if the player has moved within the virtual world. The user reads this information, decides what to do, and enters another short series of words. Examples include &quot;go west&quot;, &quot;take flashlight&quot;, or &quot;give the letter to the woman then ask her for a book&quot;.

Infocom games were written using a programming language called ZIL (Zork Implementation Language), itself derived directly from MDL, that compiled into a bytecode able to run on a standardized virtual machine called the Z-machine. As the games were text based and used variants of the same Z-machine interpreter, the interpreter had to be ported to new computer architectures only once per architecture, rather than once per game. Each game file included a sophisticated parser which allowed the user to type complex instructions to the game. Unlike earlier works of interactive fiction which only understood commands of the form &#x27;verb noun&#x27;, Infocom&#x27;s parser could understand a wider variety of sentences. For instance one might type &quot;open the large door, then go west&quot;, or &quot;go to festeron&quot;.

With the Z-machine, Infocom was able to release most of their games for most popular home computers simultaneously: Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, IBM PC compatibles, Amstrad CPC/PCW (one disc worked on both machines), Commodore 64, Commodore Plus/4, Commodore 128, Kaypro CP/M, TI-99/4A, Macintosh, Atari ST, Amiga, TRS-80, and TRS-80 Color Computer.
==History==

===Foundation and Zork===
Infocom began as a collaboration between Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) faculty and alumni, some of whom had previously worked a text-based adventure game called &quot;Zork&quot;. Development of &quot;Zork&quot; began in 1977 at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, with an initial team including Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, and Dave Lebling, as well as Bruce Daniels. Inspired by &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;, the developers aspired to improve on the formula with a more robust text parser and more logical puzzles. They did not announce their game while it was in development, but a lack of security on the MIT systems meant that anyone who could access the PDP-10 computer over the ARPANET could see what programs were being run. As a result, a small community of people discovered the new &quot;Zork&quot; adventure game and spread word of it under that name. This community interacted with the developers as they created the game, playtesting additions and submitting bug reports. 

Infocom was officially founded as a software company on June 22, 1979, with founding members Tim Anderson, Joel Berez, Marc Blank, Mike Broos, Scott Cutler, Stu Galley, Dave Lebling, J. C. R. Licklider, Chris Reeve, and Al Vezza. By the end of the year, the core &quot;Zork&quot; game was complete, and Berez was elected the company&#x27;s president. The studio began seeking a professional publisher with store and distributor connections. After Microsoft passed on the project due to competition with their own &quot;Microsoft Adventure&quot; (1979), Infocom negotiated a publishing agreement with Personal Software, one of the first professional software publishing companies. However, Infocom grew wary of the publisher&#x27;s lack of advertising for &quot;Zork I&quot;, and lack of enthusiasm for additional episodes and games. The developer decided to self-publish their games from that moment forward, buying out Personal Software&#x27;s remaining inventory of &quot;Zork&quot; games.

Following its 1980 release, &quot;Zork I&quot; became a bestseller from 1983 through 1985. By 1986, the game had sold 380,000 copies, with 680,000 sales for the trilogy overall, comprising one-third of Infocom&#x27;s two million game sales. Reviewers hailed &quot;Zork&quot; as the best adventure game to date, with later critics regarding it as one of the greatest games of all time. Historians noted the game as a foundation for the adventure game genre, as well as influencing the MUD and massively multiplayer online role-playing game genres.

=== Expansion ===
Lebling and Blank each authored several more games, and additional game writers (or &quot;Implementers&quot;) were hired, notably including Steve Meretzky. Other popular and inventive titles included a number of sequels and spinoff games in the &quot;Zork&quot; series, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams, and &quot;A Mind Forever Voyaging&quot;.

In its first few years of operation, text adventures proved to be a huge revenue stream for the company. Whereas most computer games of the era would achieve initial success and then suffer a significant drop-off in sales, Infocom titles continued to sell for years and years. Employee Tim Anderson said of their situation, &quot;It was phenomenal – we had a basement that just printed money.&quot; By 1983 Infocom was perhaps the dominant computer-game company; for example, all ten of its games were on the &quot;Softsel&quot; top 40 list of best-selling computer games for the week of December 12, 1983, with &quot;Zork&quot; in first place and two others in the top ten. In late 1984, management declined an offer by publisher Simon &amp; Schuster to acquire Infocom for $28 million, far more than the board of directors&#x27;s valuation of $10–12 million. In 1993, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described this era as the &quot;Cambridge Camelot, where the Great Underground Empire was formed&quot;.

===Reception===
Infocom games were popular, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; said, in part because &quot;in offices all over America (more than anyone realizes) executives and managers are playing games on their computers&quot;. An estimated 25% had a computer game &quot;hidden somewhere in their drawers&quot;, &quot;Inc.&quot; reported, and they preferred Infocom adventures to arcade games. The company stated that year that 75% of players were over 25 years old and that 80% were men; more women played its games than other companies&#x27;, especially the mysteries. Most players enjoyed reading books; in 1987 president Joel Berez stated, &quot;[Infocom&#x27;s] audience tends to be composed of heavy readers. We sell to the minority that does read&quot;.

A 1996 article in &quot;Next Generation&quot; said Infocom&#x27;s &quot;games were noted for having more depth than any other adventure games, before or since.&quot; Three components proved key to Infocom&#x27;s success: marketing strategy, rich storytelling and feelies. Whereas most game developers sold their games mainly in software stores, Infocom also distributed their games via bookstores. Infocom&#x27;s products appealed more to those with expensive computers, such as the Apple Macintosh, IBM PC, and Commodore Amiga. Berez stated that &quot;there is no noticeable correlation between graphics machines and our penetration. There is a high correlation between the price of the machine and our sales ... people who are putting more money into their machines tend to buy more of our software&quot;. Since their games were text-based, patrons of bookstores were drawn to the Infocom games as they were already interested in reading. Unlike most computer software, Infocom titles were distributed under a no-returns policy, which allowed them to make money from a single game for a longer period of time.

Next, Infocom titles featured strong storytelling and rich descriptions, eschewing the inherent restrictions of graphic displays and allowing users to use their own imaginations for the lavish and exotic locations the games described. Infocom&#x27;s puzzles were unique in that they were usually tightly integrated into the storyline, and rarely did gamers feel like they were being made to jump through one arbitrary hoop after another, as was the case in many of the competitors&#x27; games. The puzzles were generally logical but also required close attention to the clues and hints given in the story, causing many gamers to keep copious notes as they went along.

Sometimes, though, Infocom threw in puzzles just for the humor of it—if the user never ran into these, they could still finish the game. But discovering these early Easter Eggs was satisfying for some fans of the games. For example, one popular Easter egg was in the &quot;Enchanter&quot; game, which involves collecting magic spells to use in accomplishing the quest. One of these is a summoning spell, which the player needs to use to summon certain characters at different parts of the game. At one point the game mentions the &quot;Implementers&quot; who were responsible for creating the land of Zork. If the player tries to summon the Implementers, the game produces a vision of Dave Lebling and Marc Blank at their computers, surprised at this &quot;bug&quot; in the game and working feverishly to fix it.

Third, the inclusion of &quot;feelies&quot;—imaginative props and extras tied to the game&#x27;s theme—provided copy protection against copyright infringement. Some games were unsolvable without the extra content provided with the boxed game. And because of the cleverness and uniqueness of the feelies, users rarely felt like they were an intrusion or inconvenience, as was the case with most of the other copy-protection schemes of the time. Feelies also provided the player with a physical aspect to the gameplay of their text adventures, giving another dimension of strategy to what would other-wise just be a text parser.

Although Infocom started out with &quot;Zork&quot;, and although the &quot;Zork&quot; world was the centerpiece of their product line throughout the &quot;Zork&quot; and &quot;Enchanter&quot; series, the company quickly branched out into a wide variety of story lines: fantasy, science-fiction, mystery, horror, historical adventure, children&#x27;s stories, and others that defied easy categorization. In an attempt to reach out to female customers, Infocom also produced &quot;Plundered Hearts&quot;, which cast the gamer in the role of the heroine of a swashbuckling adventure on the high seas, and which required the heroine to use more feminine tactics to win the game, since hacking-and-slashing was not a very ladylike way to behave. Infocom also came out with &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; in 1986, which featured &quot;tame&quot;, &quot;suggestive&quot;, and &quot;lewd&quot; playing modes. It included among its &quot;feelies&quot; a &quot;scratch-and-sniff&quot; card with six odors that corresponded to cues given to the player during the game.

====Invisiclues====
Originally, hints for the game were provided as a &quot;pay-per-hint&quot; service created by Mike Dornbrook, called the Zork Users Group (ZUG). Dornbrook also started Infocom&#x27;s customer newsletter, called &quot;The New Zork Times&quot;, to discuss game hints and preview and showcase new products.

The pay-per-hint service eventually led to the development of InvisiClues: books with hints, maps, clues, and solutions for puzzles in the games. The answers to the puzzles were printed in invisible ink that only became visible when rubbed with a special marker that was provided with each book. Usually, two or more answers were given for each question that a gamer might have. The first answer would provide a subtle hint, the second a less subtle hint, and so forth until the last one gave an explicit walkthrough. Gamers could thus reveal only the hints that they needed to have to play the game. To prevent the mere questions (printed in normal ink) from giving away too much information about the game, a certain number of misleading fake questions were included in every InvisiClues book. Answers to these questions would start by giving misleading or impossible to carry out answers, before the final answer revealed that the question was a fake (and usually admonishing the player that revealing random clues from the book would spoil their enjoyment of the game). The InvisiClues books were regularly ranked in near the top of best seller lists for computer books.

In the Solid Gold line of re-releases, InvisiClues were integrated into the game. By typing &quot;HINT&quot; twice the player would open up a screen of possible topics where they could then reveal one hint at a time for each puzzle, just like the books.

====Interactive fiction====
Infocom also released a small number of &quot;interactive fiction paperbacks&quot; (gamebooks), which were based on the games (such as &quot;Zork&quot;) and featured the ability to choose a different path through the story. Similar to the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; series, every couple of pages the book would give the reader the chance to make a choice, such as which direction they wanted to go or how they wanted to respond to another character. The reader would then choose one of the given answers and turn to the appropriate page. These books, however, never did sell particularly well, and quickly disappeared from the bookshelves.

===&quot;Cornerstone&quot;===
Despite their success with computer games, Vezza and other company founders hoped to produce successful business programs like Lotus Development, also founded by people from MIT and located in the same building as Infocom. Lotus released its first product, 1-2-3, in January 1983; within a year it had earned $53 million, compared to Infocom&#x27;s $6 million. In 1982 Infocom started putting resources into a new division to produce business products. In 1985 they released a database product, &quot;Cornerstone&quot;, aimed at capturing the then booming database market for small business. Though this application was hailed upon its release for ease of use, it sold only 10,000 copies; not enough to cover the development expenses.

The program failed for a number of reasons. Although it was packaged in a slick hard plastic carrying case and was a very good database for personal and home use, it was originally priced at USD$495 per copy and used copy-protected disks. Another serious miscalculation was that the program did not include any kind of scripting language, so it was not promoted by any of the database consultants that small businesses typically hired to create and maintain their DB applications. Reviewers were also consistently disappointed that Infocom—noted for the natural language syntax of their games—did not include a natural language query ability, which had been the most anticipated feature for this database application. In a final disappointment, &quot;Cornerstone&quot; was available only for IBM PCs; while &quot;Cornerstone&quot; had been programmed with its own virtual machine for maximum portability, it was not ported to any of the other platforms that Infocom supported for their games, so that feature had become essentially irrelevant. And because &quot;Cornerstone&quot; used this virtual machine for its processing, it suffered from slow, lackluster performance.

===Changing marketplace===
Infocom&#x27;s games&#x27; sales benefited significantly from the portability offered by running on top of a virtual machine. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; wrote in 1984 that &quot;the company always sells games for computers you don&#x27;t normally think of as game machines, such as the DEC Rainbow or the Texas Instruments Professional Computer. This is one of the key reasons for the continued success of old titles such as Zork.&quot; Dornbrook estimated that year that of the 1.8 million home computers in America, one half million homes had Infocom games (&quot;all, if you count the pirated games&quot;). Computer companies sent prototypes of new systems to encourage Infocom to port Z-machine to them; the virtual machine supported more than 20 different systems, including orphaned computers for which Infocom games were among the only commercial products. The company produced the only third-party games available for the Macintosh at launch, and Berlyn promised that all 13 of its games would be available for the Atari ST within one month of its release.

The virtual machine significantly slowed &quot;Cornerstone&quot;″s execution speed, however. Businesses were moving &quot;en masse&quot; to the IBM PC platform by that time, so portability was no longer a significant differentiator. Infocom had sunk much of the money from games sales into &quot;Cornerstone&quot;; this, in addition to a slump in computer game sales, left the company in a very precarious financial position. By the time Infocom removed the copy-protection and reduced the price to less than $100, it was too late, and the market had moved on to other database solutions.

By 1982 the market was moving to graphic adventures. Infocom was interested in producing them, that year proposing to Penguin Software that Antonio Antiochia, author of its &quot;Transylvania&quot;, provide artwork. Within Infocom the game designers tended to oppose graphics, while marketing and business employees supported using them for the company to remain competitive. The partnership negotiations failed, in part because of the difficulty of adding graphics to the Z-machine, and Infocom instead began a series of advertisements mocking graphical games as &quot;graffiti&quot; compared to the human imagination. The marketing campaign was very successful, and Infocom&#x27;s success led to other companies like Broderbund and Electronic Arts also releasing their own text games.

===Activision takeover===
After &quot;Cornerstone&quot;&#x27;s failure, Infocom laid off half of its 100 employees, and Activision acquired the company on June 13, 1986, for $7.5 million. The merger was pushed by Activision&#x27;s CEO Jim Levy, who was a fan of Infocom games and felt their two companies were in similar situations. Berez stated that although the two companies&#x27; headquarters and product lines would remain separate, &quot;One of the effects of the merger will be for both of us to broaden our horizons&quot;. He said that &quot;We&#x27;re looking at graphics a lot&quot;, while Activision was reportedly interested in using Infocom&#x27;s parser.

While relations were cordial between the two companies at first, Activision&#x27;s ousting of Levy with new CEO Bruce Davis created problems in the working relationship with Infocom. Davis believed that his company had paid too much for Infocom and initiated a lawsuit against them to recoup some of the cost, along with changing the way Infocom was run. For example:
* Davis required they use Activision&#x27;s packaging plant instead of their own in-house one, raising the cost of each package from $0.45 to over $0.90. In addition, the Activision plant made numerous mistakes in packaging, whereas the Infocom one almost never did.
* Infocom had a successful marketing approach that kept its backlist in store inventories for years. Because of this, older titles continued to sell, and their sales rose when the company released newer games. &quot;Zork&quot; especially benefited; its sales rose for years after its initial release in 1980. To Infocom&#x27;s surprise it sold almost 100,000 copies of the game in 1983, and the figure rose by more than 50% in 1984. Activision preferred to market Infocom&#x27;s games the way they marketed their other titles: replacing older titles with newer ones. While this made sense for the graphically intensive games that made up the rest of Activision&#x27;s catalog, since Infocom games were text based, it didn&#x27;t make sense – the newer games didn&#x27;t have improved &quot;text&quot;. This marketing approach cut off potential revenue for numerous Infocom titles that had consistently brought in money for several years.
* Davis required the struggling developer to produce eight titles a year. Infocom had traditionally produced about four games per year with more staff than they had post-merger.
* Davis pushed Infocom to release more graphical games, but the one they did release, &quot;Fooblitzky&quot;, bombed. This was, in part, due to Infocom&#x27;s long-standing rule of maximum portability; a game that could display graphics on a number of different systems couldn&#x27;t take advantage of the strengths of any of them.
* The cost of acquisition was amortized by deducting it from Infocom&#x27;s operating revenue during the next several years.

===Later years===
By 1988, rumors spread of disputes between Activision and Infocom. Infocom employees reportedly believed that Activision gave poorer-quality games to Infocom, such as Tom Snyder Productions&#x27; unsuccessful &quot;Infocomics&quot;. Activision moved Infocom development to California in 1989, and the company was now just a publishing label. Rising costs and falling profits, exacerbated by the lack of new products in 1988 and technical issues with its DOS products, caused Activision to close Infocom in 1989, after which some of the remaining Infocom designers such as Steve Meretzky moved to the company Legend Entertainment, founded by Bob Bates and Mike Verdu, to continue creating games in the Infocom tradition.

Activision itself was struggling in the marketplace following Davis&#x27; promotion to CEO. Activision had rebranded itself as Mediagenic and tried to produce business productivity software, but became significantly in debt. In 1991, Mediagenic was purchased by Bobby Kotick, who put into measures immediately to try to turn the company around, which included returning to its Activision name, and putting to use its past IP properties. This included the Infocom games; Kotick recognized the value of the branding of &quot;Zork&quot; and other titles. Activision began to sell bundles of the Infocom games that year, packaged as themed collections (usually by genre, such as the Science Fiction collection); in 1991, they published &quot;The Lost Treasures of Infocom&quot;, followed in 1992 by &quot;The Lost Treasures of Infocom II&quot;. These compilations featured nearly every game produced by Infocom before 1988. (&quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; was not included in either bundle, but could be ordered via a coupon included with &quot;Lost Treasures II&quot;.) The compilations lacked the &quot;feelies&quot; that came with each game, but in some cases included photographs of them. In 1996, the first bundles were followed by &quot;Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom&quot;, a single CD-ROM which contained the works of both collections. This release, however, was missing &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Shogun&quot; because the licenses from Douglas Adams&#x27; and James Clavell&#x27;s estates had expired. Under Kotick&#x27;s leadership, Activision also developed &quot;Return to Zork&quot;, published under its Infocom label.

Eventually, Activision abandoned the &quot;Infocom&quot; name. The brand name was registered by Oliver Klaeffling of Germany in 2007, then was abandoned the following year. The Infocom trademark was then held by Pete Hottelet&#x27;s Omni Consumer Products, who registered the name around the same time as Klaeffling in 2007. As of March 2017, the trademark is owned by infocom.xyz, according to Bob Bates.

==Legacy==
With the exception of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Shogun&quot;, the copyrights to the Infocom games are believed to be still held by Activision. &quot;Dungeon&quot;, the mainframe precursor to the commercial Zork trilogy, is believed to be free for non-commercial use. but prohibited for commercial use. It was this copy that the popular Fortran mainframe version was based on. The C version was based on the Fortran version. and is available from The Interactive Fiction Archive as original FORTRAN source code, a Z-machine story file and as various native source ports. Many Infocom titles can be downloaded via the Internet, but only in violation of the copyright. Activision did at one point release the original trilogy for free-of-charge download as a promotion but prohibited redistribution and have since discontinued this. There are currently at least four Infocom sampler and demos available from the IF Archive as Z-machine story files which require a Z-machine interpreter to play. Interpreters are available for most computer platforms, the most widely used being the Frotz, Zip, and Nitfol interpreters.

Five games (&quot;Zork I&quot;, &quot;Planetfall&quot;, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Wishbringer&quot; and &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot;) were re-released in Solid Gold format. The Solid Gold versions of those games include a built-in InvisiClues hint system.

In 2012, Activision released &quot;Lost Treasures of Infocom&quot; for iOS devices. In-app purchases provide access for 27 of the titles. It also lacks &quot;Shogun&quot; and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; as well as &quot;Beyond Zork&quot;, &quot;Zork Zero&quot; and &quot;Nord and Bert&quot;.

Efforts have been made to make the Infocom games source code available for preservation. In 2008, Jason Scott, a video game preservationist contributing towards the Internet Archive, received the so-called &quot;Infocom Drive&quot;, a large archive of the entire contents of Infocom&#x27;s main server made during the last few days before the company was relocated to California; besides source code for all of Infocom&#x27;s games (including unreleased ones), it also contained the software manuals, design documents and other essential content alongside Infocom&#x27;s business documentation. Scott later published all of the source files in their original Z-engine format to GitHub in 2019.

&quot;Zork&quot; made a cameo appearance as an easter egg in Activision and Treyarch&#x27;s &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot;. It can be accessed from the main menu.

<text>Interactive fiction (IF) is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives, either in the form of Interactive narratives or Interactive narrations. These works can also be understood as a form of video game, either in the form of an adventure game or role-playing game. In common usage, the term refers to text adventures, a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be &quot;text-only&quot;, however, graphical text adventure games, where the text is accompanied by graphics (still images, animations or video) still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text. Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction, known as &quot;Puzzle-free&quot;, that focuses on narrative, and &quot;text adventures&quot; that focus on puzzles.

Due to their text-only nature, they sidestepped the problem of writing for widely divergent graphics architectures. This feature meant that interactive fiction games were easily ported across all the popular platforms at the time, including CP/M (not known for gaming or strong graphics capabilities). The number of interactive fiction works is increasing steadily as new ones are produced by an online community, using freely available development systems.

The term can also be used to refer to literary works that are not read in a linear fashion, known as gamebooks, where the reader is instead given choices at different points in the text; these decisions determine the flow and outcome of the story. The most famous example of this form of printed fiction is the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; book series, and the collaborative &quot;&quot; format has also been described as a form of interactive fiction. The term &quot;interactive fiction&quot; is sometimes used also to refer to visual novels, a type of interactive narrative software popular in Japan.

==Medium==

Text adventures are one of the oldest types of computer games and form a subset of the adventure genre. The player uses text input to control the game, and the game state is relayed to the player via text output. Interactive fiction usually relies on reading from a screen and on typing input, although text-to-speech synthesizers allow blind and visually impaired users to play interactive fiction titles as audio games.

Input is usually provided by the player in the form of simple sentences such as &quot;get key&quot; or &quot;go east&quot;, which are interpreted by a text parser. Parsers may vary in sophistication; the first text adventure parsers could only handle two-word sentences in the form of verb-noun pairs. Later parsers, such as those built on ZIL (Zork Implementation Language), could understand complete sentences. Later parsers could handle increasing levels of complexity parsing sentences such as &quot;open the red box with the green key then go north&quot;. This level of complexity is the standard for works of interactive fiction today.

Despite their lack of graphics, text adventures include a physical dimension where players move between rooms. Many text adventure games boasted their total number of rooms to indicate how much gameplay they offered. These games are unique in that they may create an &quot;illogical space&quot;, where going north from area A takes you to area B, but going south from area B did not take you back to area A. This can create mazes that do not behave as players expect, and thus players must maintain their own map. These illogical spaces are much more rare in today&#x27;s era of 3D gaming, and the Interactive Fiction community in general decries the use of mazes entirely, claiming that mazes have become arbitrary &#x27;puzzles for the sake of puzzles&#x27; and that they can, in the hands of inexperienced designers, become immensely frustrating for players to navigate.

Interactive fiction shares much in common with Multi-User Dungeons (&#x27;MUDs&#x27;). MUDs, which became popular in the mid-1980s, rely on a textual exchange and accept similar commands from players as do works of IF; however, since interactive fiction is single player, and MUDs, by definition, have multiple players, they differ enormously in gameplay styles. MUDs often focus gameplay on activities that involve communities of players, simulated political systems, in-game trading, and other gameplay mechanics that are not possible in a single player environment.

===Writing style===
Interactive fiction features two distinct modes of writing: the player input and the game output. As described above, player input is expected to be in simple command form (imperative sentences). A typical command may be:

The responses from the game are usually written from a second-person point of view, in present tense. This is because, unlike in most works of fiction, the main character is closely associated with the player, and the events are seen to be happening as the player plays. While older text adventures often identified the protagonist with the player directly, newer games tend to have specific, well-defined protagonists with separate identities from the player. The classic essay &quot;Crimes Against Mimesis&quot; discusses, among other IF issues, the nature of &quot;You&quot; in interactive fiction. A typical response might look something like this, the response to &quot;look in tea chest&quot; at the start of &quot;Curses&quot;:

Many text adventures, particularly those designed for humour (such as &quot;Zork&quot;, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, and &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot;), address the player with an informal tone, sometimes including sarcastic remarks (see the transcript from &quot;Curses&quot;, above, for an example). The late Douglas Adams, in designing the IF version of his &#x27;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&#x27;, created a unique solution to the final puzzle of the game: the game requires the one solitary item that the player &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot; choose at the outset of play.

Some IF works dispense with second-person narrative entirely, opting for a first-person perspective (&#x27;I&#x27;) or even placing the player in the position of an observer, rather than a direct participant. In some &#x27;experimental&#x27; IF, the concept of self-identification is eliminated, and the player instead takes the role of an inanimate object, a force of nature, or an abstract concept; experimental IF usually pushes the limits of the concept and challenges many assumptions about the medium.

==History==
===1960s and 70s===

====Natural language processing====
Though neither program was developed as a narrative work, the software programs ELIZA (1964–1966) and SHRDLU (1968–1970) can formally be considered early examples of interactive fiction, as both programs used natural language processing to take input from their user and respond in a virtual and conversational manner. ELIZA simulated a psychotherapist that appeared to provide human-like responses to the user&#x27;s input, while SHRDLU employed an artificial intelligence that could move virtual objects around an environment and respond to questions asked about the environment&#x27;s shape. The development of effective natural language processing would become an essential part of interactive fiction development.

====&quot;Adventure&quot;====
Around 1975, Will Crowther, a programmer and an amateur caver, wrote the first text adventure game, &quot;Adventure&quot; (originally called &quot;ADVENT&quot; because a filename could only be six characters long in the operating system he was using, and later named &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;). Having just gone through a divorce, he was looking for a way to connect with his two young children. Over the course of a few weekends, he wrote a text based cave exploration game that featured a sort of guide/narrator who spoke in full sentences and who understood simple two word commands that came close to natural English. Adventure was programmed in Fortran for the PDP-10. Crowther&#x27;s original version was an accurate simulation of part of the real life Mammoth Cave, but also included fantasy elements (such as axe-wielding dwarves and a magic bridge).

Stanford University graduate student Don Woods discovered &quot;Adventure&quot; while working at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and in 1977 obtained and expanded Crowther&#x27;s source code (with Crowther&#x27;s permission). Woods&#x27;s changes were reminiscent of the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien, and included a troll, elves, and a volcano, which some claim is based on Mount Doom, but Woods says was not.

In early 1977, Adventure spread across ARPAnet, and has survived on the Internet to this day. The game has since been ported to many other operating systems, and was included with the floppy-disk distribution of Microsoft&#x27;s MS-DOS 1.0 OS. &quot;Adventure&quot; is a cornerstone of the online IF community; there currently exist dozens of different independently programmed versions, with additional elements, such as new rooms or puzzles, and various scoring systems.

The popularity of &quot;Adventure&quot; led to the wide success of interactive fiction during the late 1970s, when home computers had little, if any, graphics capability. Many elements of the original game have survived into the present, such as the command &#x27;xyzzy&#x27;, which is now included as an Easter Egg in modern games, such as &quot;Microsoft Minesweeper&quot;.

&quot;Adventure&quot; was also directly responsible for the founding of Sierra Online (later Sierra Entertainment); Ken and Roberta Williams played the game and decided to design one of their own, but with graphics.

====Commercial era====
Adventure International was founded by Scott Adams (not to be confused with the creator of Dilbert). In 1978, Adams wrote &quot;Adventureland&quot;, which was loosely patterned after the (original) &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;. He took out a small ad in a computer magazine in order to promote and sell &quot;Adventureland&quot;, thus creating the first commercial adventure game. In 1979 he founded Adventure International, the first commercial publisher of interactive fiction. That same year, &quot;Dog Star Adventure&quot; was published in source code form in &quot;SoftSide&quot;, spawning legions of similar games in BASIC.

The largest company producing works of interactive fiction was Infocom, which created the &quot;Zork&quot; series and many other titles, among them &quot;Trinity&quot;, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and &quot;A Mind Forever Voyaging&quot;.

In June 1977, Marc Blank, Bruce K. Daniels, Tim Anderson, and Dave Lebling began writing the mainframe version of &quot;Zork&quot; (also known as &quot;Dungeon&quot;), at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science. The game was programmed in a computer language called MDL, a variant of LISP.

The term Implementer was the self-given name of the creators of the text adventure series Zork. It is for this reason that game designers and programmers can be referred to as an implementer, often shortened to &quot;Imp&quot;, rather than a writer.

In early 1979, the game was completed. Ten members of the &quot;MIT Dynamics Modelling Group&quot; went on to join Infocom when it was incorporated later that year.

In order to make its games as portable as possible, Infocom developed the Z-machine, a custom virtual machine that could be implemented on a large number of platforms, and took standardized &quot;story files&quot; as input.

In a non-technical sense, Infocom was responsible for developing the interactive style that would be emulated by many later interpreters. The Infocom parser was widely regarded as the best of its era. It accepted complex, complete sentence commands like &quot;put the blue book on the writing desk&quot; at a time when most of its competitors parsers were restricted to simple two word verb-noun combinations such as &quot;put book&quot;. The parser was actively upgraded with new features like undo and error correction, and later games would &#x27;understand&#x27; multiple sentence input: &#x27;pick up the gem and put it in my bag. take the newspaper clipping out of my bag then burn it with the book of matches&#x27;.

Several companies offered optional commercial feelies (physical props associated with a game). The tradition of &#x27;feelies&#x27; (and the term itself) is believed to have originated with &quot;Deadline&quot; (1982), the third Infocom title after &quot;Zork I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;. When writing this game, it was not possible to include all of the information in the limited (80KB) disk space, so Infocom created the first feelies for this game; extra items that gave more information than could be included within the digital game itself. These included police interviews, the coroner&#x27;s findings, letters, crime scene evidence and photos of the murder scene.

These materials were very difficult for others to copy or otherwise reproduce, and many included information that was essential to completing the game. Seeing the potential benefits of both aiding game-play immersion and providing a measure of creative copy-protection, in addition to acting as a deterrent to software piracy, Infocom and later other companies began creating feelies for numerous titles. In 1987, Infocom released a special version of the first three &quot;Zork&quot; titles together with plot-specific coins and other trinkets. This concept would be expanded as time went on, such that later game feelies would contain passwords, coded instructions, page numbers, or other information that would be required to successfully complete the game.

===1980s===

====United States====
Interactive fiction became a standard product for many software companies. By 1982 &quot;Softline&quot; wrote that &quot;the demands of the market are weighted heavily toward hi-res graphics&quot; in games like Sierra&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard and the Princess&quot; and its imitators. Such graphic adventures became the dominant form of the genre on computers with graphics, like the Apple II. By 1982 Adventure International began releasing versions of its games with graphics. The company went bankrupt in 1985. Synapse Software and Acornsoft were also closed in 1985, leaving Infocom as the leading company producing text-only adventure games on the Apple II with sophisticated parsers and writing, and still advertising its lack of graphics as a virtue. The company was bought by Activision in 1986 after the failure of &quot;Cornerstone&quot;, Infocom&#x27;s database software program, and stopped producing text adventures a few years later. Soon after, Telaium/Trillium also closed.

====Outside the United States====
Probably the first commercial work of interactive fiction produced outside the U.S. was the dungeon crawl game of &quot;Acheton&quot;, produced in Cambridge, England, and first commercially released by Acornsoft (later expanded and reissued by Topologika). Other leading companies in the UK were Magnetic Scrolls and Level 9 Computing. Also worthy of mention are Delta 4, Melbourne House, and the homebrew company Zenobi.

In the early 1980s Edu-Ware also produced interactive fiction for the Apple II as designated by the &quot;if&quot; graphic that was displayed on startup. Their titles included the &quot;Prisoner&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; series (&quot;Empire I: World Builders&quot;, &quot;Empire II: Interstellar Sharks&quot;, &quot;Empire III: Armageddon&quot;).

In 1981, CE Software published &quot;SwordThrust&quot; as a commercial successor to the &quot;Eamon&quot; gaming system for the Apple II. SwordThrust and Eamon were simple two-word parser games with many role-playing elements not available in other interactive fiction. While SwordThrust published seven different titles, it was vastly overshadowed by the non-commercial Eamon system which allowed private authors to publish their own titles in the series. By March 1984, there were 48 titles published for the Eamon system (and over 270 titles in total as of March 2013).

In Italy, interactive fiction games were mainly published and distributed through various magazines in included tapes. The largest number of games were published in the two magazines Viking and Explorer, with versions for the main 8-bit home computers (ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and MSX). The software house producing those games was Brainstorm Enterprise, and the most prolific IF author was Bonaventura Di Bello, who produced 70 games in the Italian language. The wave of interactive fiction in Italy lasted for a couple of years thanks to the various magazines promoting the genre, then faded and remains still today a topic of interest for a small group of fans and less known developers, celebrated on Web sites and in related newsgroups.

In Spain, interactive fiction was considered a minority genre, and was not very successful. The first Spanish interactive fiction commercially released was &quot;Yenght&quot; in 1983, by Dinamic Software, for the ZX Spectrum. Later on, in 1987, the same company produced an interactive fiction about &quot;Don Quijote&quot;. After several other attempts, the company Aventuras AD, emerged from Dinamic, became the main interactive fiction publisher in Spain, including titles like a Spanish adaptation of &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;, an adaptation of the Spanish comic &quot;El Jabato&quot;, and mainly the &quot;Ci-U-Than&quot; trilogy, composed by &quot;La diosa de Cozumel&quot; (1990), &quot;Los templos sagrados&quot; (1991) and &quot;Chichen Itzá&quot; (1992). During this period, the Club de Aventuras AD (CAAD), the main Spanish speaking community around interactive fiction in the world, was founded, and after the end of Aventuras AD in 1992, the CAAD continued on its own, first with their own magazine, and then with the advent of Internet, with the launch of an active internet community that still produces interactive non commercial fiction nowadays.

===During the 1990s===
Legend Entertainment was founded by Bob Bates and Mike Verdu in 1989. It started out from the ashes of Infocom. The text adventures produced by Legend Entertainment used (high-resolution) graphics as well as sound. Some of their titles include &quot;Eric the Unready&quot;, the &quot;Spellcasting&quot; series and &quot;Gateway&quot; (based on Frederik Pohl&#x27;s novels).

The last text adventure created by Legend Entertainment was &quot;Gateway II&quot; (1992), while the last game ever created by Legend was &quot;Unreal II: The Awakening&quot; (2003) – the well-known first-person shooter action game using the Unreal Engine for both impressive graphics and realistic physics. In 2004, Legend Entertainment was acquired by Atari, who published &quot;Unreal II&quot; and released for both Microsoft Windows and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox.

Many other companies such as Level 9 Computing, Magnetic Scrolls, Delta 4 and Zenobi had closed by 1992.

In 1991 and 1992, Activision released &quot;The Lost Treasures of Infocom&quot; in two volumes, a collection containing most of Infocom&#x27;s games, followed in 1996 by &quot;Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom&quot;.

===Modern era===
After the decline of the commercial interactive fiction market in the 1990s, an online community eventually formed around the medium. In 1987, the Usenet newsgroup was created, and was soon followed by . By custom, the topic of is interactive fiction authorship and programming, while encompasses topics related to playing interactive fiction games, such as hint requests and game reviews. As of late 2011, discussions between writers have mostly moved from to the Interactive Fiction Community Forum.

One of the most important early developments was the reverse-engineering of Infocom&#x27;s Z-Code format and Z-Machine virtual machine in 1987 by a group of enthusiasts called the InfoTaskForce and the subsequent development of an interpreter for Z-Code story files. As a result, it became possible to play Infocom&#x27;s work on modern computers.

For years, amateurs with the IF community produced interactive fiction works of relatively limited scope using the Adventure Game Toolkit and similar tools.

The breakthrough that allowed the interactive fiction community to truly prosper, however, was the creation and distribution of two sophisticated development systems. In 1987, Michael J. Roberts released TADS, a programming language designed to produce works of interactive fiction. In 1993, Graham Nelson released Inform, a programming language and set of libraries which compiled to a Z-Code story file. Each of these systems allowed anyone with sufficient time and dedication to create a game, and caused a growth boom in the online interactive fiction community.

Despite the lack of commercial support, the availability of high quality tools allowed enthusiasts of the genre to develop new high quality games. Competitions such as the annual Interactive Fiction Competition for short works, the Spring Thing for longer works, and the XYZZY Awards, further helped to improve the quality and complexity of the games. Modern games go much further than the original &quot;Adventure&quot; style, improving upon Infocom games, which relied extensively on puzzle solving, and to a lesser extent on communication with non player characters, to include experimentation with writing and story-telling techniques.

While the majority of modern interactive fiction that is developed is distributed for free, there are some commercial endeavors. In 1998, Michael Berlyn, a former Implementor at Infocom, started a new game company, Cascade Mountain Publishing, whose goals were to publish interactive fiction. Despite the Interactive Fiction community providing social and financial backing, Cascade Mountain Publishing went out of business in 2000. Buster Hudson, developer of &quot;The Wizard Sniffer&quot; (201&quot;7),&quot; emphasized that parser-based puzzle can be used to control the pacing or develop a character.

Other commercial endeavors include: Peter Nepstad&#x27;s &quot;1893: A World&#x27;s Fair Mystery&quot;, several games by Howard Sherman published as Malinche Entertainment, The General Coffee Company&#x27;s &quot;Future Boy!,&quot; &quot;Cypher&quot;, a graphically enhanced cyberpunk game and various titles by &quot;Textfyre&quot;. Emily Short was commissioned to develop the game &quot;City of Secrets&quot; but the project fell through and she ended up releasing it herself.

==Software==
===Development systems===
The original Interactive fiction Colossal Cave Adventure was programmed in Fortran, originally developed by IBM. Adventure&#x27;s parsers could only handle two-word sentences in the form of verb-noun pairs.

Infocom&#x27;s games of 1979–88, such as Zork, were written using a LISP-like programming language called ZIL (Zork Implementation Language or Zork Interactive Language; it was referred to as both) that compiled into a byte code able to run on a standardized virtual machine called the Z-machine. As the games were text based and used variants of the same Z-machine interpreter, the interpreter only had to be ported to a computer once, rather than once each game. Each game file included a sophisticated parser which allowed the user to type complex instructions to the game. Unlike earlier works of interactive fiction which only understood commands of the form &#x27;verb noun&#x27;, Infocom&#x27;s parser could understand a wider variety of sentences. For instance one might type &quot;open the large door, then go west&quot;, or &quot;go to the hall&quot;. With the Z-machine, Infocom was able to release most of their games for most popular home computers of the time simultaneously, including Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, IBM PC compatibles, Amstrad CPC/PCW (one disc worked on both machines), Commodore 64, Commodore Plus/4, Commodore 128, Kaypro CP/M, TI-99/4A, Macintosh, Atari ST, Amiga, and TRS-80.

During the 1990s Interactive fiction was mainly written with C-like languages, such as TADS 2 and Inform 6. A number of systems for writing interactive fiction now exist. The most popular remain Inform, TADS, or ADRIFT, but they diverged in their approach to IF-writing during the 2000s, giving today&#x27;s IF writers an objective choice. By 2006 IFComp, most games were written for Inform, with a strong minority of games for TADS and ADRIFT, followed by a small number of games for other systems.

While familiarity with a programming language leads many new authors to attempt to produce their own complete IF application, most established IF authors recommend use of a specialised IF language, arguing that such systems allow authors to avoid the technicalities of producing a full featured parser, while allowing broad community support. The choice of authoring system usually depends on the author&#x27;s desired balance of ease of use versus power, and the portability of the final product.

Other development systems include:
* David Malmberg&#x27;s Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT)
* Incentive Software&#x27;s Graphic Adventure Creator (GAC)
*Inkle&#x27;s inklewriter
* Professional Adventure Writer
* Gilsoft&#x27;s The Quill
* Twine

===Interpreters and virtual machines===
Interpreters are the software used to play the works of interactive fiction created with a development system. Since they need to interact with the player, the &quot;story files&quot; created by development systems are programs in their own right. Rather than running directly on any one computer, they are programs run by Interpreters, or virtual machines, which are designed specially for IF. They may be part of the development system, or can be compiled together with the work of fiction as a standalone executable file.

The Z-machine was designed by the founders of Infocom, in 1979. They were influenced by the then-new idea of a virtual Pascal computer, but replaced P with Z for Zork, the celebrated adventure game of 1977–79. The Z-machine evolved during the 1980s but over 30 years later, it remains in use essentially unchanged. Glulx was designed by Andrew Plotkin in the late 1990s as a new-generation IF virtual machine. It overcomes the technical constraint on the Z-machine by being a 32-bit rather than 16-bit processor. Frotz is a modern Z-machine interpreter originally written in C (programming language) by Stefan Jokisch in 1995 for DOS. Over time it was ported to other platforms, such as Unix, RISC OS, Mac OS and most recently iOS. Modern Glulx interpreters are based on &quot;Glulxe&quot;, by Andrew Plotkin, and &quot;Git&quot;, by Iain Merrick. Other interpreters include Zoom for Mac OS X, or for Unix or Linux, maintained by Andrew Hunter, and Spatterlight for Mac OS X, maintained by Tor Andersson.

===Distribution===
In addition to commercial distribution venues and individual websites, many works of free interactive fiction are distributed through community websites. These include the Interactive Fiction Database (IFDb), The Interactive Fiction Reviews Organization (IFRO), a game catalog and recommendation engine, and the Interactive Fiction Archive.

Works may be distributed for playing with in a separate interpreter. In which case they are often made available in the Blorb package format that many interpreters support. A filename ending .zblorb is a story file intended for a Z-machine in a Blorb wrapper, while a filename ending .gblorb is a story file intended for a Glulx in a Blorb wrapper. It is not common but IF files are sometimes also seen without a Blorb wrapping, though this usually means cover art, help files, and so forth are missing, like a book with the covers torn off. Z-machine story files usually have names ending .z5 or .z8, the number being a version number, and Glulx story files usually end .ulx.

Alternatively, works may be distributed for playing in a web browser. For example, the &#x27;Parchment&#x27; project is for web browser-based IF Interpreter, for both Z-machine and Glulx files.

Some software such as Twine publishes directly to HTML, the standard language used to create web pages, reducing the requirement for an Interpreter or virtual machine.

<text>Ice hockey (or simply hockey in North America) is a team sport played on ice skates, usually on an ice skating rink with lines and markings specific to the sport. It belongs to a family of sports called hockey. Two opposing teams use ice hockey sticks to control, advance, and shoot a vulcanized rubber hockey puck into the other team&#x27;s net. Each goal is worth one point. The team with the highest score after an hour of playing time is declared the winner; ties are broken in overtime or a shootout. In a formal game, each team has six skaters on the ice at a time, barring any penalties, including a goaltender. It is a full contact game and one of the more physically demanding team sports. 

The modern sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in Montreal, where the first indoor game was played on March 3, 1875. It draws influence from shinty which originated in Scotland, as well as field hockey which originated in England. Some characteristics of ice hockey, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and professional ice hockey originated around 1900. The Stanley Cup, emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was initially commissioned in 1892 as the &quot;Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup&quot; and was first awarded in 1893 to recognise the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the National Hockey League (NHL). In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the , in Paris, France, the precursor to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). The sport was played for the first time at the Olympics during the 1920 Summer Games—today it is a mainstay at the Winter Olympics. In 1994, ice hockey was officially recognized as Canada&#x27;s national winter sport.

While women also played during the game&#x27;s early formative years, it was not until organizers began to officially remove body checking from female ice hockey beginning in the mid-1980s that it began to gain greater popularity, which by then had spread to Europe and a variety of other countries. The IIHF Women&#x27;s World Championship was held in 1990, and women&#x27;s play was introduced into the Olympics in 1998. 

== History ==

Ice hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, Ireland, and elsewhere, primarily bandy, hurling, and shinty. The North American sport of lacrosse, derived from tribal Native American games, was also influential. The former games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules developed, such as shinny and ice polo, but later were absorbed into a new organized game with codified rules which today is ice hockey.

==Game==

While the general characteristics of the game remain constant, the exact rules depend on the particular code of play being used. The two most important codes are those of the IIHF and the NHL. Both of these codes, and others, originated from Canadian rules of ice hockey of the early 20th century.

Ice hockey is played on a &quot;hockey rink&quot;. During normal play, there are six players on ice skates on the ice per side, one of them being the goaltender. The objective of the game is to score &quot;goals&quot; by shooting a hard vulcanized rubber disc, the &quot;puck&quot;, into the opponent&#x27;s goal net at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck.

With certain restrictions, players may redirect the puck with any part of their body. Players may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited from using their hands to pass the puck to their teammates unless they are in the defensive zone. Players can knock a puck out of the air with their hands to themselves. Players are prohibited from kicking the puck into the opponent&#x27;s goal, though unintentional redirections off their body or equipment, including skates, are permitted. Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands or any part of their body.

Hockey is an off-side game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s, hockey was an on-side game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. Those rules emphasized individual stick-handling to drive the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a true team sport, where individual performance diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.
 
The six players on each team are typically divided into three forwards, two defencemen, and one goaltender. The term &quot;skaters&quot; typically applies to all players except goaltenders. The &quot;forward&quot; positions consist of a &quot;centre&quot; and two &quot;wingers&quot;: a &quot;left wing&quot; and a &quot;right wing&quot;. Forwards often play together as units or &quot;lines&quot;, with the same three forwards always playing together. The &quot;defencemen&quot; usually stay together as a pair generally divided between left and right. Left and right side wingers or defencemen are generally positioned on the side on which they carry their stick. A substitution of an entire unit at once is called a &quot;line change&quot;. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when &quot;short-handed&quot; or on a &quot;power play&quot;. The goaltender stands in a, usually blue, semi-circle called the &quot;crease&quot; in the defensive zone keeping pucks out of the goal. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing &quot;on the fly&quot;. An NHL rule added in the 2005–06 season prevents a team from making any player substitutions after they &quot;ice&quot; the puck.

The boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play and they can also be used as tools to play the puck. Players are permitted to bodycheck opponents into the boards to stop progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of the goal are &quot;in play&quot; and do not stop the game when the puck or players either bounce into or collide with them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. After a stoppage, play is restarted with a faceoff. Two players face each other and an official drops the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain control of the puck. Markings (circles) on the ice indicate the locations for the faceoff and guide the positioning of players.

Three major rules of play in ice hockey limit the movement of the puck: &quot;offside&quot;, &quot;icing&quot;, and the puck going out of play. 
*A player is offside if he enters his opponent&#x27;s zone before the puck itself. 
*Under many situations, a player may not &quot;ice the puck&quot;, which means shooting the puck all the way across both the centre line and the opponent&#x27;s goal line. 
*The puck goes out of play whenever it goes past the perimeter of the ice rink (onto the player benches, over the glass, or onto the protective netting above the glass) and a stoppage of play is called by the officials using whistles. It does not matter if the puck comes back onto the ice surface from outside of the rink, because the puck is considered dead once it leaves the perimeter of the rink. The referee may also blow the whistle for a stoppage in play if the puck is jammed along the boards when two or more players are battling for the puck for a long time, or if the puck is stuck on the back of any of the two nets for a period of time.

Under IIHF rules, each team may carry a maximum of 20 players and two goaltenders on their roster. NHL rules restrict the total number of players per game to 18, plus two goaltenders. In the NHL, the players are usually divided into four lines of three forwards, and into three pairs of defencemen. On occasion, teams may elect to substitute an extra defenceman for a forward. The seventh defenceman may play as a substitute defenceman, spend the game on the bench, or if a team chooses to play four lines then this seventh defenceman may see ice-time on the fourth line as a forward.

===Periods and overtime===
A professional ice hockey game consists of three periods of twenty minutes, the clock running only when the puck is in play. There is a rest period between the three periods. The teams change ends after each period of play, including overtime. Recreational leagues and children&#x27;s leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play.

If a tie occurs in tournament play, as well as in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour &quot;sudden death overtime&quot;, in which the teams continue to play twenty-minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999–2000 season, regular-season NHL games were settled with a single five-minute sudden death period with five players (plus a goalie) per side, with both teams awarded one point in the standings in the event of a tie. With a goal, the winning team would be awarded two points and the losing team none (just as if they had lost in regulation). The total elapsed time from when the puck first drops, is about 2 hours and 20 minutes for a 60-minute game.

From the 1999–2000 until the 2003–04 seasons, the National Hockey League decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden-death overtime period with each team having four skaters per side (plus the goalie). In the event of a tie, each team would still receive one point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded two points in the standings and the losing team one point. The idea was to discourage teams from playing for a tie, since previously some teams might have preferred a tie and 1 point to risking a loss and zero points. The exception to this rule is if a team opts to pull their goalie in exchange for an extra skater during overtime and is subsequently scored upon (an &quot;empty net&quot; goal), in which case the losing team receives no points for the overtime loss. Since the 2015–16 season, the single five-minute sudden-death overtime session involves three skaters on each side. Since three skaters must always be on the ice in an NHL game, the consequences of penalties are slightly different from those during regulation play; any penalty during overtime that would result in a team losing a skater during regulation instead causes the other side to add a skater. Once the penalized team&#x27;s penalty ends, the penalized skater exits the penalty box and the teams continue at 4-on-4 until the next stoppage of play, at which point the teams return to three skaters per side.

International play and several North American professional leagues, including the NHL (in the regular season), now use an overtime period identical to that from 1999–2000 to 2003–04 followed by a penalty shootout. If the score remains tied after an extra overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of three players from each team taking penalty shots. After these six total shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, the shootout then proceeds to &quot;sudden death&quot;. Regardless of the number of goals scored by either team during the shootout, the final score recorded will award the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time. In the NHL if a game is decided in overtime or by a shootout the winning team is awarded two points in the standings and the losing team is awarded one point. Ties no longer occur in the NHL.

Overtime in the NHL playoffs differs from the regular season. In the playoffs there are no shootouts. If a game is tied after regulation, then a 20-minute period of 5-on-5 sudden-death overtime will be added. If the game is still tied after the overtime, another period is added until a team scores, which wins the match. Since 2019, the IIHF World Championships and the gold medal game in the Olympics use the same format, but in a 3-on-3 format.

===Penalties===
In ice hockey, infractions of the rules lead to a play stoppage whereby the play is restarted at a faceoff. Some infractions result in a &quot;penalty&quot; on a player or team. In the simplest case, the offending player is sent to the &quot;penalty box&quot; and their team must play with one less player on the ice for a designated time. &quot;Minor&quot; penalties last for two minutes, &quot;major&quot; penalties last for five minutes, and a &quot;double minor&quot; penalty is two &quot;consecutive&quot; penalties of two minutes duration. A single minor penalty may be extended by two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. Players may be also assessed personal extended penalties or game expulsions for misconduct in addition to the penalty or penalties their team must serve. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing &quot;short-handed&quot; while the opposing team is on a &quot;power play&quot;.

A two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as tripping, elbowing, roughing, high-sticking, delay of the game, too many players on the ice, boarding, illegal equipment, charging (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), holding, holding the stick (grabbing an opponent&#x27;s stick), interference, hooking, slashing, kneeing, unsportsmanlike conduct (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), &quot;butt-ending&quot; (striking an opponent with the knob of the stick), &quot;spearing&quot; (jabbing an opponent with the blade of the stick), or cross-checking. As of the 2005–2006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for diving, where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. 

Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a minor penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. Major penalties assessed for fighting are typically offsetting, meaning neither team is short-handed and the players exit the penalty box upon a stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties. The foul of boarding (defined as &quot;check[ing] an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards&quot;) is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.

Some varieties of penalty do not require the offending team to play a man short. Concurrent five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, both the players serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player (both teams still have a full complement of players on the ice). This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In this case, both teams will have only four skating players (not counting the goaltender) until one or both penalties expire (if one penalty expires before the other, the opposing team gets a power play for the remainder of the time); this applies regardless of current pending penalties. In the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Thus, ten-minute &quot;misconduct&quot; penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice &quot;unless&quot; a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a &quot;two-and-ten&quot; or &quot;five-and-ten&quot;). In this case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, &quot;game misconducts&quot; are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent (at the officials&#x27; discretion), or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface (he does not sit in the penalty box); meanwhile, if an additional minor or major penalty is assessed, a designated player must serve out of that segment of the penalty in the box (similar to the above-mentioned &quot;two-and-ten&quot;). In some rare cases, a player may receive up to nineteen minutes in penalties for one string of plays. This could involve receiving a four-minute double-minor penalty, getting in a fight with an opposing player who retaliates, and then receiving a game misconduct after the fight. In this case, the player is ejected and two teammates must serve the double-minor and major penalties.
A penalty shot is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a breakaway. A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.

Officials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one&#x27;s hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one&#x27;s defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game).

In the NHL, a unique penalty applies to the goalies. The goalies now are forbidden to play the puck in the &quot;corners&quot; of the rink near their own net. This will result in a two-minute penalty against the goalie&#x27;s team. Only in the area in front of the goal line and immediately behind the net (marked by two red lines on either side of the net) can the goalie play the puck.

An additional rule that has never been a penalty, but was an infraction in the NHL before recent rules changes, is the two-line offside pass. Prior to the 2005–06 NHL season, play was stopped when a pass from inside a team&#x27;s defending zone crossed the centre line, with a face-off held in the defending zone of the offending team. Now, the centre line is no longer used in the NHL to determine a two-line pass infraction, a change that the IIHF had adopted in 1998. Players are now able to pass to teammates who are more than the blue and centre ice red line away.

The NHL has taken steps to speed up the game of hockey and create a game of finesse, by reducing the number of illegal hits, fights, and &quot;clutching and grabbing&quot; that occurred in the past. Rules are now more strictly enforced, resulting in more penalties, which provides more protection to the players and facilitates more goals being scored. The governing body for United States&#x27; amateur hockey has implemented many new rules to reduce the number of stick-on-body occurrences, as well as other detrimental and illegal facets of the game (&quot;zero tolerance&quot;).

In men&#x27;s hockey, but not in women&#x27;s, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it. This use of the hip and shoulder is called &quot;body checking&quot;. Not all physical contact is legal—in particular, hits from behind, hits to the head and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal.

A &quot;delayed penalty call&quot; occurs when an offence is committed by the team that does not have possession of the puck. In this circumstance the team with possession of the puck is allowed to complete the play; that is, play continues until a goal is scored, a player on the opposing team gains control of the puck, or the team in possession commits an infraction or penalty of their own. Because the team on which the penalty was called cannot control the puck without stopping play, it is impossible for them to score a goal. In these cases, the team in possession of the puck can pull the goalie for an extra attacker without fear of being scored on. It is possible for the controlling team to mishandle the puck into their own net. If a delayed penalty is signalled and the team in possession scores, the penalty is still assessed to the offending player, but not served. In 2012, this rule was changed by the United States&#x27; National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for college level hockey. In college games, the penalty is still enforced even if the team in possession scores.

===Officials===

A typical game of hockey is governed by two to four &quot;officials&quot; on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two &quot;linesmen&quot; who are mainly responsible for calling &quot;offside&quot; and &quot;icing&quot; violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs, and one or two &quot;referees&quot;, who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can report to the referee(s) that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations. The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.

The most widespread system is the &quot;three-man system&quot;, which uses one referee and two linesmen. A less commonly used system is the two referee and one linesman system. This system is close to the regular three-man system except for a few procedure changes. Beginning with the National Hockey League, a number of leagues have implemented the &quot;four-official system&quot;, where an additional referee is added to aid in the calling of penalties normally difficult to assess by one referee. The system is used in every NHL game since 2001, at IIHF World Championships, the Olympics and in many professional and high-level amateur leagues in North America and Europe.

Officials are selected by the league they work for. Amateur hockey leagues use guidelines established by national organizing bodies as a basis for choosing their officiating staffs. In North America, the national organizing bodies Hockey Canada and USA Hockey approve officials according to their experience level as well as their ability to pass rules knowledge and skating ability tests. Hockey Canada has officiating levels I through VI. USA Hockey has officiating levels 1 through 4.

===Equipment===
====Protective gear====

Since men&#x27;s ice hockey is a full-contact sport, body checks are allowed so injuries are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet with either a visor or a full face mask, shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts (also known as hockey pants) or a girdle, athletic cup (also known as a jock, for males; and jill, for females), shin pads, skates, and (optionally) a neck protector.

====Goaltenders====
Goaltenders use different equipment. With hockey pucks approaching them at speeds of up to they must wear equipment with more protection. Goaltenders wear specialized goalie skates (these skates are built more for movement side to side rather than forwards and backwards), a jock or jill, large leg pads (there are size restrictions in certain leagues), blocking glove, catching glove, a chest protector, a goalie mask, and a large jersey. Goaltenders&#x27; equipment has continually become larger and larger, leading to fewer goals in each game and many official rule changes.

====Ice skates====
Ice hockey skates are optimized for physical acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability. This includes rapid starts, stops, turns, and changes in skating direction. In addition, they must be rigid and tough to protect the skater&#x27;s feet from contact with other skaters, sticks, pucks, the boards, and the ice itself. Rigidity also improves the overall manoeuvrability of the skate. Blade length, thickness (width), and curvature (rocker/radius) (front to back) and radius of hollow (across the blade width) are quite different from speed or figure skates. Hockey players usually adjust these parameters based on their skill level, position, and body type. The blade width of most skates are about thick.

====Ice hockey stick====
Each player other than the goaltender carries a stick consisting of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved flat blade, attached to a shaft. The curve itself has a big impact on its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots. The flex of the stick also impacts the performance. Typically, a less flexible stick is meant for a stronger player since the player is looking for the right balanced flex that allows the stick to flex easily while still having a strong &quot;whip-back&quot; which sends the puck flying at high speeds. It is quite distinct from sticks in other sports games and most suited to hitting and controlling the flat puck. Its unique shape contributed to the early development of the game.

The goaltender carries a stick of a different design, with a larger blade and a wide, flat shaft. This stick is primarily intended to block shots, but the goaltender may use it to play the puck as well.

== Injury ==
Ice hockey is a full-contact sport and carries a high risk of injury. Players are moving at speeds around approximately and much of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulder contact, hip contact, and hockey pucks can all potentially cause injuries. Lace bite, an irritation felt on the front of the foot or ankle, is a common ice hockey injury.

Compared to athletes who play other sports, ice hockey players are at higher risk of overuse injuries and injuries caused by early sports specialization by teenagers.

According to the Hughston Health Alert, prior to the widespread use of helmets and face cages, &quot;Lacerations to the head, scalp, and face are the most frequent types of injury [in hockey].&quot;

One of the leading causes of head injury is body checking from behind. Due to the danger of delivering a check from behind, many leagues – including the NHL – have made this a major and game misconduct penalty. Another type of check that accounts for many of the player-to-player contact concussions is a check to the head resulting in a misconduct penalty (called &quot;head contact&quot;). In recent years, the NHL has implemented new rules which penalize and suspend players for illegal checks to the heads, as well as checks to unsuspecting players. Studies show that ice hockey causes 44.3% of all sports-related traumatic brain injuries among Canadian children.

Some teams in the Swiss National League are testing out systems that combine helmet-integrated sensors and analysis software to reveal a player&#x27;s ongoing brain injury risk during a game. These sensors provide players and coaches with real-time data on head impact strength, frequency, and severity. Furthermore, if the app determines that a particular impact has the potential to cause brain injury, it will alert the coach who can in turn seek medical attention for the individual.

==Tactics==

===Defensive tactics===
Defensive ice hockey tactics vary from more active to more conservative styles of play. One distinction is between man-to-man oriented defensive systems, and zonal oriented defensive systems, though a lot of teams use a combination between the two. Defensive skills involve &quot;pass interception&quot;, &quot;shot blocking&quot;, and &quot;stick checking&quot; (in which an attempt to take away the puck or cut off the puck lane is initiated by the stick of the defensive player). Tactical points of emphasis in ice hockey defensive play are concepts like &quot;managing gaps&quot; (gap control), &quot;boxing out&quot;&#x27; (not letting the offensive team go on the inside), and &quot;staying on the right side&quot; (of the puck). Another popular concept in ice hockey defensive tactics is that of playing a 200-foot game.

====Checking====
An important defensive tactic is checking—attempting to take the puck from an opponent or to remove the opponent from play. &quot;Stick checking&quot;, &quot;sweep checking&quot;, and &quot;poke checking&quot; are legal uses of the stick to obtain possession of the puck. The &quot;neutral zone trap&quot; is designed to isolate the puck carrier in the neutral zone preventing him from entering the offensive zone. &quot;Body checking&quot; is using one&#x27;s shoulder or hip to strike an opponent who has the puck or who is the last to have touched it (the last person to have touched the puck is still legally &quot;in possession&quot; of it, although a penalty is generally called if he is checked more than two seconds after his last touch). Body checking is also a penalty in certain leagues in order to reduce the chance of injury to players. Often the term checking is used to refer to body checking, with its true definition generally only propagated among fans of the game.

One of the most important strategies for a team is their &quot;forecheck&quot;. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking is an important part of the &quot;dump and chase&quot; strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team uses their own unique system but the main ones are: 2–1–2, 1–2–2, and 1–4. The 2–1–2 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards go in deep and pressure the opposition&#x27;s defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1–2–2 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions&#x27; wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1–4 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward applies pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions&#x27; blueline and the other four players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the left wing lock, which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.

===Offensive tactics===

Offensive tactics include improving a team&#x27;s position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one&#x27;s zone towards the opponent&#x27;s zone, progressively by gaining lines, first your own blue line, then the red line and finally the opponent&#x27;s blue line. NHL rules instated for the 2006 season redefined the offside rule to make the two-line pass legal; a player may pass the puck from behind his own blue line, past both that blue line and the centre red line, to a player on the near side of the opponents&#x27; blue line. Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot. When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent&#x27;s goal, he or she is said to &quot;shoot&quot; the puck.

A &quot;deflection&quot; is a shot that redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player, by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal. A &quot;one-timer&quot; is a shot struck directly off a pass, without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions. &quot;Headmanning the puck&quot;, also known as &quot;breaking out&quot;, is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice. &quot;Loafing&quot;, also known as &quot;cherry-picking&quot;, is when a player, usually a forward, skates behind an attacking team, instead of playing defence, in an attempt to create an easy scoring chance.

A team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to &quot;pull the goalie&quot;; that is, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an &quot;extra attacker&quot; on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. This is a desperate act, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.
There are many other little tactics used in the game of hockey. &quot;Cycling&quot; moves the puck along the boards in the offensive zone to create a scoring chance by making defenders tired or moving them out of position. &quot;Pinching&quot; is when a defenceman pressures the opposition&#x27;s winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. A &quot;saucer pass&quot; is a pass used when an opposition&#x27;s stick or body is in the passing lane. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate&#x27;s stick.

A deke, short for &quot;decoy&quot;, is a feint with the body or stick to fool a defender or the goalie. Many modern players, such as Pavel Datsyuk, Sidney Crosby and Patrick Kane, have picked up the skill of &quot;dangling&quot;, which is fancier deking and requires more stick handling skills.

A tactic used by a player to keep possession of the puck is &quot;stick handling&quot; and also known as &quot;ragging&quot;. A player can use their stick to manipulate the puck out of reach of opposing players, while attempting to skate past them. When combined with deking or dangling skills, a player can attempt an &quot;end-to-end rush&quot; and make a solo play to score. Ragging is also a common penalty-killing tactic to use up time during a penalty&#x27;s duration.

===Fights===

Although fighting is officially prohibited in the rules, it is not an uncommon occurrence at the professional level, and its prevalence has been both a target of criticism and a considerable draw for the sport. At the professional level in North America fights are unofficially condoned. Enforcers and other players fight to demoralize the opposing players while exciting their own, as well as settling personal scores. A fight will also break out if one of the team&#x27;s skilled players gets hit hard or someone receives what the team perceives as a dirty hit. The amateur game penalizes fisticuffs more harshly, as a player who receives a fighting major is also assessed at least a 10-minute misconduct penalty (NCAA and some Junior leagues) or a game misconduct penalty and suspension (high school and younger, as well as some casual adult leagues).
==Women&#x27;s ice hockey==

===History===


Women began playing the game of ice hockey in the late 19th century. Several games were recorded in the 1890s in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The women of Lord Stanley&#x27;s family were known to participate in the game of ice hockey on the outdoor ice rink at Rideau Hall, the residence of Canada&#x27;s Governor General.

The earliest available records of women&#x27;s ice hockey were in the late 19th-century in Canada. Much like the men&#x27;s game, women had previously been playing a conglomeration of stick-and-ball ice games. As with men&#x27;s hockey, the women&#x27;s game developed at first without an organizing body. A tournament in 1902 between Montreal and Trois-Rivières was billed as the first women&#x27;s ice hockey championship tournament. Several tournaments, such as at the Banff Winter Carnival, were held in the early 20th century with numerous women&#x27;s teams such as the Seattle Vamps and Vancouver Amazons. Organizations started to develop in the 1920s, such as the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association in Canada, and later, the Dominion Women&#x27;s Amateur Hockey Association.

Starting in Canada in 1961, the women&#x27;s game spread to more universities after the &quot;Fitness and Amateur Sport Act&quot; came into force in whereby the Government of Canada made an official commitment to &quot;encourage, promote and develop fitness and amateur sport in Canada.&quot;

Today, the women&#x27;s game is played from youth through adult leagues, and at the university level in North America and internationally. In 2019, the Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey Players Association was formed by over 150 players with the goal of creating a sustainable professional league for women&#x27;s ice hockey in North America. Today, there are major professional women&#x27;s hockey leagues: the Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League, with teams in the United States and Canada, and the Zhenskaya Hockey League, with teams in Russia and, previously, China.

Prior to the professionalization of women&#x27;s ice hockey in the 21st century, professional women hockey players who played against men tended to be goaltenders. The United States Hockey League (USHL) welcomed the first female professional ice hockey player in 1969–70, when the Marquette Iron Rangers signed 18-year-old goaltender Karen Koch. Only one woman has ever played in the National Hockey League (NHL), goaltender Manon Rhéaume. Rhéaume played in NHL pre-season games as a goaltender for the Tampa Bay Lightning against the St. Louis Blues and the Boston Bruins. In 2003, forward Hayley Wickenheiser played with the Kirkkonummi Salamat in the Finnish men&#x27;s Suomi-sarja league. Women have occasionally competed in North American minor leagues: among them Rhéaume, and fellow goaltenders Kelly Dyer and Erin Whitten. Defenceman Angela Ruggiero became the first woman to actively play in a regular season professional hockey game in North America at a position other than goalie, playing in a single game for the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Hockey League.

Between 1995 and 2005 the number of women&#x27;s hockey participants increased by 400 percent. In 2011, Canada had 85,827 women players, the United States had 65,609, Finland 4,760, Sweden 3,075 and Switzerland 1,172.

Women&#x27;s ice hockey was added as an Olympic medal sport eight years after the first official women&#x27;s ice hockey world championship in 1990, at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. 
===Women&#x27;s World Championship===
The 1987 World Women&#x27;s Hockey Tournament in Toronto was the first international competition in women&#x27;s hockey, although it was not sanctioned by the IIHF. Two years later, the 1989 IIHF European Women Championships in West Germany was the first IIHF-sanctioned event and the first European Championship held in women&#x27;s hockey, preceding the IIHF-sanctioned Women&#x27;s World Championship. The first world ice hockey championship for women was the 1990 IIHF Women&#x27;s World Championship in Ottawa. 

As of 2025, more than forty national teams participate in the annual competition, across four divisions: ten teams play in the top division and twelve teams each in Division I, Division II, and Division III. From the introduction of women&#x27;s ice hockey as a medal sport in 1998, the top division tournament was not held in Olympic years until a change was approved to the IIHF Statutes &amp; Bylaws in 2021; the 2022 top division tournament was the first to be held in an Olympic season.

===Equipment===
Players in women&#x27;s competition are required to wear protective full-face masks. At all levels, players must wear a pelvic protector, essentially the female equivalent of a jockstrap, known colloquially as a &quot;jill&quot; or &quot;jillstrap&quot;. Other protective equipment for girls and women in ice hockey is sometimes specifically designed for the female body, such as shoulder pads designed to protect a women&#x27;s breast area without reducing mobility.

===Body checking===
Body checking has long been a divisive topic in women&#x27;s hockey, and has largely been prohibited since the mid-1980s in Canada, and from there internationally. Canada&#x27;s Rhonda Leeman Taylor was responsible for banning body contact from all Canadian national women&#x27;s tournaments in 1983. Body checking in some of the women&#x27;s hockey leagues in Canada was completely removed in 1986, which helped lead to a substantial increase in female participation in youth ice hockey in Canada.

Prior to this point, body checking had been a part of the women&#x27;s game in most cases, including in Europe. It was not until after the 1990 Women&#x27;s World Championship that body checking was eliminated from women&#x27;s hockey internationally. In addition, until the mid-2000s, obstruction and interference were allowed, including pushing players in front of the net, minor hooking, and setting picks. When the National Hockey League removed obstruction and interference in the mid-2000s, minor hockey leagues and female leagues followed suit. In women&#x27;s IIHF ice hockey today, body checking is considered an &quot;illegal hit&quot; and is punishable by a minor penalty, major penalty and game misconduct, or match penalty.

The idea of reintroducing body checking to the female game after its removal in the 1980s and 1990s remains controversial. Some of those opposed to its reintroduction maintain it would lead to a loss of female participants, as once stated by Arto Sieppi, Finland&#x27;s director of women&#x27;s hockey. Sieppi made the statement in response to claims made by the head coach of Sweden&#x27;s national women&#x27;s team, Peter Elander, who had claimed its absence was due to patriarchal sexism.

The Svenska damhockeyligan (SDHL), known as the Swedish Women&#x27;s Hockey League in English, announced in 2022 that it would include body checking during its 2022–23 season, but would maintain a prohibition on open-ice hits. The new program also applies to the Damettan, Sweden&#x27;s second-tier women&#x27;s league. The Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League, the highest level of women&#x27;s professional hockey, which debuted in 2024, also allows body checking. The PWHL rule-book outlines that body checking is permissible &quot;when there is a clear intention of playing the puck or attempting to &#x27;gain possession&#x27; of the puck&quot;, which is allowed principally along the boards. League executive Jayna Hefford has stated that body checking was included at the behest of players, and the league&#x27;s physicality drew positive reviews when the league began play in January 2024.

==Leagues and championships==
The following is a list of professional ice hockey leagues by attendance:

===Club competition===
====North America====
The NHL is the best attended and most popular ice hockey league in the world, and is among the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The league&#x27;s history began after Canada&#x27;s National Hockey Association decided to disband in 1917; the result was the creation of the National Hockey League with four teams. The league expanded to the United States beginning in 1924 and had as many as 10 teams before contracting to six teams—known today as the Original Six—by 1942–43. In 1967, the NHL doubled in size to 12 teams, undertaking one of the greatest expansions in professional sports history. A few years later, in 1972, a new 12-team league, the World Hockey Association (WHA), was formed and its ensuing rivalry with the NHL caused a rapid escalation in players&#x27; salaries. In 1979, the 17-team NHL merged with the WHA creating a 21-team league. By 2017, the NHL had expanded to 31 teams, and after a realignment in 2013, these teams were divided into two conferences and four divisions. The league expanded to 32 teams in 2021.

The American Hockey League (AHL) is the primary developmental professional league for players aspiring to enter the NHL. It comprises 31 teams from the United States and Canada. It is run as a farm league to the NHL, with the vast majority of AHL players under contract to an NHL team. The ECHL (called the East Coast Hockey League before the 2003–04 season) is a mid-level minor league in the United States with a few players under contract to NHL or AHL teams.

As of 2019, there are three minor professional leagues with no NHL affiliations: the Federal Prospects Hockey League (FPHL), (LNAH), and the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL).

U Sports ice hockey is the highest level of play at the Canadian university level under the auspices of U Sports, Canada&#x27;s governing body for university sports. As these players compete at the university level, they are obligated to follow the rule of standard eligibility of five years.
In the United States especially, college hockey is popular and the best university teams compete in the annual NCAA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship. The American Collegiate Hockey Association is composed of college teams at the club level.

In Canada, the Canadian Hockey League is an umbrella organization comprising three major junior leagues: the Ontario Hockey League, the Western Hockey League, and the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League. It attracts players from Canada, the United States, and Europe. The major junior players are considered amateurs as they are under 21-years-old and not paid a salary, rather a stipend, and play a schedule similar to a professional league. Typically, the NHL drafts many players directly from the major junior leagues. In the United States, the United States Hockey League (USHL) is the highest junior league. Players in this league are also amateur with players required to be under 21-years old, but do not get a stipend, which allows players to retain their eligibility for participation in NCAA ice hockey.

The Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League is the highest level of club competition in women&#x27;s hockey. It was founded in 2023 and debuted in 2024 with three teams in Canada and three in the United States.

====Eurasia====
The Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is the largest and most popular ice hockey league in Eurasia. The league is the direct successor to the Russian Super League, which in turn was the successor to the Soviet League, the history of which dates back to the Soviet adoption of ice hockey in the 1940s. The KHL was launched in 2008 with clubs predominantly from Russia, but featuring teams from other post-Soviet states. The league expanded beyond the former Soviet countries beginning in the 2011–12 season, with clubs in Croatia and Slovakia. The KHL currently comprises member clubs based in Belarus (1), China (1), Kazakhstan (1) and Russia (19) for a total of 22.

The second division of hockey in Eurasia is the Supreme Hockey League (VHL). This league features 24 teams from Russia and 2 from Kazakhstan. This league is currently being converted to a farm league for the KHL, similarly to the AHL&#x27;s function in relation to the NHL. The third division is the Russian Hockey League, which features only teams from Russia. The Asia League, an international ice hockey league featuring clubs from China, Japan, South Korea, and the Russian Far East, is the successor to the Japan Ice Hockey League.

The highest junior league in Eurasia is the Junior Hockey League (MHL). It features 32 teams from post-Soviet states, predominantly Russia. The second tier to this league is the Junior Hockey League Championships (MHL-B).

====Europe====
Several countries in Europe have their own top professional senior leagues. Many future KHL and NHL players start or end their professional careers in these leagues. The National League A in Switzerland, Swedish Hockey League in Sweden, SM-liiga in Finland, and Czech Extraliga in the Czech Republic are all very popular in their respective countries.

Beginning in the 2014–15 season, the Champions Hockey League was launched, a league consisting of first-tier teams from several European countries, running parallel to the teams&#x27; domestic leagues. The competition is meant to serve as a Europe-wide ice hockey club championship. The competition is a direct successor to the European Trophy and is related to the 2008–09 tournament of the same name.

There are also several annual tournaments for clubs, held outside of league play. Pre-season tournaments include the European Trophy, Tampere Cup and the Pajulahti Cup. One of the oldest international ice hockey competition for clubs is the Spengler Cup, held every year in Davos, Switzerland, between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day. It was first awarded in 1923 to the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club. The Memorial Cup, a competition for junior-level (age 20 and under) clubs is held annually from a pool of junior championship teams in Canada and the United States.

International club competitions organized by the IIHF include the Continental Cup, the Victoria Cup and the European Women&#x27;s Champions Cup. The World Junior Club Cup is an annual tournament of junior ice hockey clubs representing each of the top junior leagues.

====Other regions====
The Australian Ice Hockey League and New Zealand Ice Hockey League are represented by nine and five teams respectively. As of 2012, the two top teams of the previous season from each league compete in the Trans-Tasman Champions League.

Ice hockey in Africa is a small but growing sport; while no African ice hockey playing nation has a domestic national league, there are several regional leagues in South Africa.

===National team competitions===

Ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924 (and was played at the summer games in 1920). Hockey is Canada&#x27;s national winter sport, and Canadians are extremely passionate about the game. The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic Games, winning six of the first seven gold medals. By 1956, its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The USSR won all but two gold medals from 1956 to 1988. The United States won its first gold medal in 1960. On the way to winning the gold medal at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics, amateur US college players defeated the heavily favoured Soviet squad—an event known as the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; in the United States. Restrictions on professional players were fully dropped at the 1988 games in Calgary. NHL agreed to participate ten years later. The 1998 Games saw the full participation of players from the NHL, which suspended operations during the Games and has done so in subsequent Games up until 2018. The 2010 games in Vancouver were the first played in an NHL city since the inclusion of NHL players. The 2010 games were the first played on NHL-sized ice rinks, which are narrower than the IIHF standard.

National teams representing the member federations of the IIHF compete annually in the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships. Teams are selected from the available players by the individual federations, without restriction on amateur or professional status. Since it is held in the spring, the tournament coincides with the annual NHL Stanley Cup playoffs and many of the top players are hence not available to participate in the tournament. Many of the NHL players who do play in the IIHF tournament come from teams eliminated before the playoffs or in the first round, and federations often hold open spots until the tournament to allow for players to join the tournament after their club team is eliminated. For many years, the tournament was an amateur-only tournament, but this restriction was removed, beginning in 1977.

The 1972 Summit Series and 1974 Summit Series, two series pitting the best Canadian and Soviet players without IIHF restrictions were major successes, and established a rivalry between Canada and the USSR. In the spirit of best-versus-best without restrictions on amateur or professional status, the series were followed by five Canada Cup tournaments, played in North America. Two NHL versus USSR series were also held: the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous &#x27;87. The Canada Cup tournament later became the World Cup of Hockey, played in 1996, 2004 and 2016. The United States won in 1996 and Canada won in 2004 and 2016.

Since the initial women&#x27;s world championships in 1990, there have been fifteen tournaments. Women&#x27;s hockey has been played at the Olympics since 1998. The only finals in the women&#x27;s world championship or Olympics that did not involve both Canada and the United States were the 2006 Winter Olympic final between Canada and Sweden and 2019 World Championship final between the US and Finland.

Other ice hockey tournaments featuring national teams include the World Junior Championship, the World U18 Championships, the World U-17 Hockey Challenge, the World Junior A Challenge, the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, the World Women&#x27;s U18 Championships and the 4 Nations Cup. The annual Euro Hockey Tour, an unofficial European championship between the national men&#x27;s teams of the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia and Sweden have been played since 1996–97.

===Attendance records===

The attendance record for an ice hockey game was set on December 11, 2010, when the University of Michigan&#x27;s men&#x27;s ice hockey team faced cross-state rival Michigan State in an event billed as &quot;The Big Chill at the Big House&quot;. The game was played at Michigan&#x27;s (American) football venue, Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, with a capacity of 109,901 as of the 2010 football season. When UM stopped sales to the public on May 6, 2010, with plans to reserve remaining tickets for students, over 100,000 tickets had been sold for the event. Ultimately, a crowd announced by UM as 113,411, the largest in the stadium&#x27;s history (including football), saw the homestanding Wolverines win 5–0. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, using a count of ticketed fans who actually entered the stadium instead of UM&#x27;s figure of tickets sold, announced a final figure of 104,173.

The record was approached but not broken at the 2014 NHL Winter Classic, which also held at Michigan Stadium, with the Detroit Red Wings as the home team and the Toronto Maple Leafs as the opposing team with an announced crowd of 105,491. The record for an NHL Stanley Cup playoff game is 28,183, set on April 23, 1996, at the Thunderdome during a Tampa Bay Lightning – Philadelphia Flyers game.

The attendance record for a professional women&#x27;s game was set on April 20, 2024, when a sold-out crowd of 21,105 people at the Bell Centre in Montreal watched a PWHL game between Montreal and Toronto.

==International status==
Ice hockey is most popular in Canada, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, and the United States. Ice hockey is the official national winter sport of Canada. 

In addition, ice hockey is the most popular winter sport in Austria, Belarus, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Norway, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland. North America&#x27;s National Hockey League (NHL) is the highest level for men&#x27;s ice hockey and the strongest professional ice hockey league in the world. The Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is the highest league in Russia and much of Eastern Europe. 

The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) is the formal governing body for international ice hockey, with the IIHF managing international tournaments and maintaining the IIHF World Ranking. Worldwide, the International Ice Hockey Federation has 83 member national associations, comprising 60 full members, 22 associate members, and one affiliate member.

In international competitions, the national teams of six countries (the Big Six) predominate: Canada, Czechia, Finland, Russia, Sweden, and the United States. Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in men&#x27;s competition at the Olympics, only seven medals were not awarded to one of those countries (or two of their precursors: the Soviet Union for Russia, and Czechoslovakia for Czechia). In the annual Ice Hockey World Championships, 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations; Canada has won the most gold medals. Teams outside the Big Six have won only nine medals in either competition since 1953. 

The World Cup of Hockey is organized by the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA), unlike the annual World Championships and quadrennial Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. World Cup games are played under NHL rules and not those of the IIHF, and the tournament occurs prior to the NHL pre-season, allowing for all NHL players to be available, unlike the World Championships, which overlaps with the NHL&#x27;s Stanley Cup playoffs. Furthermore, all twelve Women&#x27;s Olympic and 36 IIHF Women&#x27;s World Championship medals were awarded to one of the Big Six. The Canadian national team or the United States national team have between them won every gold medal of either series.

===Number of registered players by country===
Number of registered hockey players, including male, female and junior, provided by the respective countries&#x27; federations. This list only includes the 36 of 82 IIHF member countries with more than 1,000 registered players as of February 2024.

==Variants==
===Pond hockey===

Pond hockey is a form of ice hockey played generally as pick-up hockey on lakes, ponds and artificial outdoor rinks during the winter. Pond hockey is commonly referred to in hockey circles as shinny. Its rules differ from traditional hockey because there is no hitting and very little shooting, placing a greater emphasis on skating, stickhandling and passing abilities. Since 2002, the World Pond Hockey Championship has been played on Roulston Lake in Tobique Valley, New Brunswick, Canada. Since 2006, the US Pond Hockey Championships have been played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the Canadian National Pond Hockey Championships have been played in Huntsville, Ontario.

===Sledge hockey===
Sledge hockey is an adaption of ice hockey designed for players who have a physical disability. Players are seated in sleds and use a specialized hockey stick that also helps the player navigate on the ice. The sport was created in Sweden in the early 1960s and is played under similar rules to ice hockey.

==In popular culture==
Ice hockey is the official winter sport of Canada. Ice hockey, partially because of its popularity as a major professional sport, has been a source of inspiration for numerous films, television episodes and songs in Canadian and American popular culture.

<text>IEEE 802.3 is a working group and a collection of standards defining the physical layer and data link layer&#x27;s media access control (MAC) of wired Ethernet. The standards are produced by the working group of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). This set of standards generally applies to local area networks (LANs) and has some wide area network (WAN) applications. Physical connections are made between network nodes and, usually, various network infrastructure devices (hubs, switches, routers) by various types of copper cables or optical fiber.

802.3 standards support the IEEE 802.1 network architecture.

802.3 also defines a LAN access method using carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).

<text>In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware nearly always provides a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer.

== Value and representation ==
The &quot;value&quot; of an item with an integral type is the mathematical integer that it corresponds to. Integral types may be &quot;unsigned&quot; (capable of representing only non-negative integers) or &quot;signed&quot; (capable of representing negative integers as well).

An integer value is typically specified in the source code of a program as a sequence of digits optionally prefixed with + or −. Some programming languages allow other notations, such as hexadecimal (base 16) or octal (base 8). Some programming languages also permit digit group separators.

The &quot;internal representation&quot; of this datum is the way the value is stored in the computer&#x27;s memory. Unlike mathematical integers, a typical datum in a computer has some minimal and maximum possible value.

The most common representation of a positive integer is a string of bits, using the binary numeral system. The order of the memory bytes storing the bits varies; see endianness. The &quot;width&quot;, &quot;precision&quot;, or &quot;bitness&quot; of an integral type is the number of bits in its representation. An integral type with &quot;n&quot; bits can encode 2&quot;n&quot; numbers; for example an unsigned type typically represents the non-negative values 0 through . Other encodings of integer values to bit patterns are sometimes used, for example binary-coded decimal or Gray code, or as printed character codes such as ASCII.

There are four well-known ways to represent signed numbers in a binary computing system. The most common is two&#x27;s complement, which allows a signed integral type with &quot;n&quot; bits to represent numbers from through . Two&#x27;s complement arithmetic is convenient because there is a perfect one-to-one correspondence between representations and values (in particular, no separate +0 and −0), and because addition, subtraction and multiplication do not need to distinguish between signed and unsigned types. Other possibilities include offset binary, sign-magnitude, and ones&#x27; complement.

Some computer languages define integer sizes in a machine-independent way; others have varying definitions depending on the underlying processor word size. Not all language implementations define variables of all integer sizes, and defined sizes may not even be distinct in a particular implementation. An integer in one programming language may be a different size in a different language, on a different processor, or in an execution context of different bitness; see .

Some older computer architectures used decimal representations of integers, stored in binary-coded decimal (BCD) or other format. These values generally require data sizes of 4 bits per decimal digit (sometimes called a nibble), usually with additional bits for a sign. Many modern CPUs provide limited support for decimal integers as an extended datatype, providing instructions for converting such values to and from binary values. Depending on the architecture, decimal integers may have fixed sizes (e.g., 7 decimal digits plus a sign fit into a 32-bit word), or may be variable-length (up to some maximum digit size), typically occupying two digits per byte (octet).

== Common integral data types ==
Different CPUs support different integral data types. Typically, hardware will support both signed and unsigned types, but only a small, fixed set of widths.

The table above lists integral type widths that are supported in hardware by common processors. High-level programming languages provide more possibilities. It is common to have a &#x27;double width&#x27; integral type that has twice as many bits as the biggest hardware-supported type. Many languages also have &quot;bit-field&quot; types (a specified number of bits, usually constrained to be less than the maximum hardware-supported width) and &quot;range&quot; types (that can represent only the integers in a specified range).

Some languages, such as Lisp, Smalltalk, REXX, Haskell, Python, and Raku, support &quot;arbitrary precision&quot; integers (also known as &quot;infinite precision integers&quot; or &quot;bignums&quot;). Other languages that do not support this concept as a top-level construct may have libraries available to represent very large numbers using arrays of smaller variables, such as Java&#x27;s class or Perl&#x27;s &quot;&quot; package. These use as much of the computer&#x27;s memory as is necessary to store the numbers; however, a computer has only a finite amount of storage, so they, too, can only represent a finite subset of the mathematical integers. These schemes support very large numbers; for example one kilobyte of memory could be used to store numbers up to 2466 decimal digits long.

A Boolean type is a type that can represent only two values: 0 and 1, usually identified with &quot;false&quot; and &quot;true&quot; respectively. This type can be stored in memory using a single bit, but is often given a full byte for convenience of addressing and speed of access.

A four-bit quantity is known as a &quot;nibble&quot; (when eating, being smaller than a &quot;bite&quot;) or &quot;nybble&quot; (being a pun on the form of the word &quot;byte&quot;). One nibble corresponds to one digit in hexadecimal and holds one digit or a sign code in binary-coded decimal.

=== Bytes and octets ===

The term &quot;byte&quot; initially meant &#x27;the smallest addressable unit of memory&#x27;. In the past, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 9-bit bytes have all been used. There have also been computers that could address individual bits (&#x27;bit-addressed machine&#x27;), or that could only address 16- or 32-bit quantities (&#x27;word-addressed machine&#x27;). The term &quot;byte&quot; was usually not used at all in connection with bit- and word-addressed machines.

The term &quot;octet&quot; always refers to an 8-bit quantity. It is mostly used in the field of computer networking, where computers with different byte widths might have to communicate.

In modern usage &quot;byte&quot; almost invariably means eight bits, since all other sizes have fallen into disuse; thus &quot;byte&quot; has come to be synonymous with &quot;octet&quot;.

=== Words ===

The term &#x27;word&#x27; is used for a small group of bits that are handled simultaneously by processors of a particular architecture. The size of a word is thus CPU-specific. Many different word sizes have been used, including 6-, 8-, 12-, 16-, 18-, 24-, 32-, 36-, 39-, 40-, 48-, 60-, and 64-bit. Since it is architectural, the size of a &quot;word&quot; is usually set by the first CPU in a family, rather than the characteristics of a later compatible CPU. The meanings of terms derived from &quot;word&quot;, such as &quot;longword&quot;, &quot;doubleword&quot;, &quot;quadword&quot;, and &quot;halfword&quot;, also vary with the CPU and OS.

Practically all new desktop processors are capable of using 64-bit words, though embedded processors with 8- and 16-bit word size are still common. The 36-bit word length was common in the early days of computers.

One important cause of non-portability of software is the incorrect assumption that all computers have the same word size as the computer used by the programmer. For example, if a programmer using the C language incorrectly declares as a variable that will be used to store values greater than 215−1, the program will fail on computers with 16-bit integers. That variable should have been declared as , which has at least 32 bits on any computer. Programmers may also incorrectly assume that a pointer can be converted to an integer without loss of information, which may work on (some) 32-bit computers, but fail on 64-bit computers with 64-bit pointers and 32-bit integers. This issue is resolved by C99 in stdint.h in the form of .

The &quot;bitness&quot; of a program may refer to the word size (or bitness) of the processor on which it runs, or it may refer to the width of a memory address or pointer, which can differ between execution modes or contexts. For example, 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows support existing 32-bit binaries, and programs compiled for Linux&#x27;s x32 ABI run in 64-bit mode yet use 32-bit memory addresses.

=== Standard integer ===
The standard integer size is platform-dependent.

In C, it is denoted by and required to be at least 16 bits. Windows and Unix systems have 32-bit s on both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

=== Short integer ===
A &quot;short integer&quot; can represent a whole number that may take less storage, while having a smaller range, compared with a standard integer on the same machine.

In C, it is denoted by . It is required to be at least 16 bits, and is often smaller than a standard integer, but this is not required. A conforming program can assume that it can safely store values between −(215−1) and 215−1, but it may not assume that the range is not larger. In Java, a is &quot;always&quot; a 16-bit integer. In the Windows API, the datatype is defined as a 16-bit signed integer on all machines.

=== Long integer ===
A &quot;long integer&quot; can represent a whole integer whose range is greater than or equal to that of a standard integer on the same machine.

In C, it is denoted by . It is required to be at least 32 bits, and may or may not be larger than a standard integer. A conforming program can assume that it can safely store values between −(231−1) and 231−1, but it may not assume that the range is not larger.

=== Long long ===

In the C99 version of the C programming language and the C++11 version of C++, a codice_1 type is supported that has double the minimum capacity of the standard codice_2. This type is not supported by compilers that require C code to be compliant with the previous C++ standard, C++03, because the type did not exist in C++03. For an ANSI/ISO compliant compiler, the minimum requirements for the specified ranges, that is, −(263−1) to 263−1 for signed and 0 to 264−1 for unsigned, must be fulfilled; however, extending this range is permitted. This can be an issue when exchanging code and data between platforms, or doing direct hardware access. Thus, there are several sets of headers providing platform independent exact width types. The C standard library provides &quot;stdint.h&quot;; this was introduced in C99 and C++11.

== Syntax ==
Integer literals can be written as regular Arabic numerals, consisting of a sequence of digits and with negation indicated by a minus sign before the value. However, most programming languages disallow use of commas or spaces for digit grouping. Examples of integer literals are:

* codice_3
* codice_4
* codice_5 

There are several alternate methods for writing integer literals in many programming languages:

* Many programming languages, especially those influenced by C, prefix an integer literal with codice_6 or codice_7 to represent a hexadecimal value, e.g. codice_8. Other languages may use a different notation, e.g. some assembly languages append an codice_9 or codice_10 to the end of a hexadecimal value.
* Perl, Ruby, Java, Julia, D, Go, C#, Rust and Python (starting from version 3.6) allow embedded underscores for clarity, e.g. codice_11, and fixed-form Fortran ignores embedded spaces in integer literals. C (starting from C23) and C++ use single quotes for this purpose.
* In C and C++, a leading zero indicates an octal value, e.g. codice_12. This was primarily intended to be used with Unix modes; however, it has been criticized because normal integers may also lead with zero. As such, Python, Ruby, Haskell, and OCaml prefix octal values with codice_13 or codice_14, following the layout used by hexadecimal values.
* Several languages, including Java, C#, Scala, Python, Ruby, OCaml, C (starting from C23) and C++ can represent binary values by prefixing a number with codice_15 or codice_16.

== Extreme values ==
In many programming languages, there exist predefined constants representing the least and the greatest values representable with a given integer type. 

Names for these include
* SmallBASIC: 
* Java: , 
*: Corresponding fields exist for the other integer classes in Java.
* C: , etc.
** GLib: , , , ...

* Pascal: 
* Python 2: 
* Turing:

<text>An icon () is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, in the cultures of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Catholic churches. The most common subjects include Jesus, Mary, saints, and angels. Although especially associated with portrait-style images concentrating on one or two main figures, the term also covers most of the religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by Eastern Christianity, including narrative scenes, usually from the Bible or the lives of saints.

Icons are most commonly painted on wood panels with egg tempera, but they may also be cast in metal or carved in stone or embroidered on cloth or done in mosaic or fresco work or printed on paper or metal, etc. Comparable images from Western Christianity may be classified as &quot;icons&quot;, although &quot;iconic&quot; may also be used to describe the static style of a devotional image. In the Greek language, the term for icon painting uses the same word as for &quot;writing&quot;, and Orthodox sources often translate it into English as &quot;icon writing&quot;.

Eastern Orthodox tradition holds that the production of Christian images dates back to the very early days of Christianity, and that it has been a continuous tradition since then. Modern academic art history considers that, while images may have existed earlier, the tradition can be traced back only as far as the 3rd century, and that the images which survive from Early Christian art often differ greatly from later ones. The icons of later centuries can be linked, often closely, to images from the 5th century onwards, though very few of these survive. Widespread destruction of images occurred during the Byzantine Iconoclasm of 726–842, although this did settle permanently the question of the appropriateness of images. Since then, icons have had a great continuity of style and subject, far greater than in the icons of the Western church. At the same time there have been change and development.

==History==

===Emergence of the icon===


====Origins in primitive Christianity in the first century====
Pre-Christian religions had produced and used art works. Statues and paintings of various gods and deities were regularly worshiped and venerated. It is unclear when Christians took up such activities. Christian tradition dating from the 8th century identifies Luke the Evangelist as the first icon painter, but this might not reflect historical facts. A general assumption that early Christianity was generally aniconic, opposed to religious imagery in both theory and practice until about 200, has been challenged by Paul Corby Finney&#x27;s analysis of early Christian writing and material remains (1994). His assumption distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting early Christians on the issue: &quot;first that humans could have a direct vision of God; second that they could not; and, third, that although humans could see God they were best advised not to look, and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen&quot;.

These derived respectively from Greek and Near Eastern pagan religions, from Ancient Greek philosophy, and from the Jewish tradition and the Old Testament. Of the three, Finney concludes that &quot;overall, Israel&#x27;s aversion to sacred images influenced early Christianity considerably less than the Greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined&quot;, so placing less emphasis on the Jewish background of most of the first Christians than most traditional accounts.

Finney suggests that &quot;the reasons for the non-appearance of Christian art before 200 have nothing to do with principled aversion to art, with other-worldliness, or with anti-materialism. The truth is simple and mundane: Christians lacked land and capital. Art requires both. As soon as they began to acquire land and capital, Christians began to experiment with their own distinctive forms of art&quot;.

Aside from the legend that Pilate had made an image of Christ, the 4th-century Eusebius of Caesarea, in his &quot;Church History&quot;, provides a more substantial reference to a &quot;first&quot; icon of Jesus. He relates that King Abgar of Edessa (died ) sent a letter to Jesus at Jerusalem, asking Jesus to come and heal him of an illness. This version of the Abgar story does not mention an image. A later account found in the Syriac &quot;Doctrine of Addai&quot; () mentions a painted image of Jesus in the story. Even later, in the 6th-century account given by Evagrius Scholasticus, the painted image transforms into an image that miraculously appeared on a towel when Christ pressed the cloth to his wet face. Further legends relate that the cloth remained in Edessa until the 10th century, when it was taken by General John Kourkouas to Constantinople. It went missing in 1204 when Crusaders sacked Constantinople, but by then numerous copies had firmly established its iconic type.

The 4th-century Christian Aelius Lampridius produced the earliest known written records of Christian images treated like icons (in a pagan or Gnostic context) in his &quot;Life of Alexander Severus&quot; (xxix) that formed part of the &quot;Augustan History&quot;. According to Lampridius, the emperor Alexander Severus (), himself not a Christian, had kept a domestic chapel for the veneration of images of deified emperors, of portraits of his ancestors, and of Christ, Apollonius, Orpheus and Abraham. Saint Irenaeus, () in his &quot;Against Heresies&quot; (1:25;6) says scornfully of the Gnostic Carpocratians:

On the other hand, Irenaeus does not speak critically of icons or portraits in a general sense—only of certain gnostic sectarians&#x27; use of icons.

Another criticism of image veneration appears in the non-canonical 2nd-century Acts of John (generally considered a gnostic work), in which the Apostle John discovers that one of his followers has had a portrait made of him, and is venerating it:

Later in the passage John says, &quot;But this that you have now done is childish and imperfect: you have drawn a dead likeness of the dead.&quot;

At least some of the hierarchy of the Christian churches still strictly opposed icons in the early 4th century. At the Spanish non-ecumenical Synod of Elvira () bishops concluded, &quot;Pictures are not to be placed in churches, so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration&quot;.

Bishop Epiphanius of Salamis, wrote his letter 51 to John, Bishop of Jerusalem () in which he recounted how he tore down an image in a church and admonished the other bishop that such images are &quot;opposed[...] to our religion&quot;.

====Icons in Eusebius to Philostorgius (425 AD)====
Elsewhere in his &quot;Church History&quot;, Eusebius reports seeing what he took to be portraits of Jesus, Peter and Paul, and also mentions a bronze statue at Banias/Paneas under Mount Hermon, of which he wrote, &quot;They say that this statue is an image of Jesus&quot;. Further, he relates that locals regarded the image as a memorial of the healing of the woman with an issue of blood by Jesus (Luke 8:43–48), because it depicted a standing man wearing a double cloak and with arm outstretched, and a woman kneeling before him with arms reaching out as if in supplication.

John Francis Wilson suggests the possibility that this refers to a pagan bronze statue whose true identity had been forgotten. Some have thought it to represent Aesculapius, the Greek god of healing, but the description of the standing figure and the woman kneeling in supplication precisely matches images found on coins depicting the bearded emperor Hadrian () reaching out to a female figure—symbolizing a province—kneeling before him.

When asked by Constantia (Emperor Constantine&#x27;s half-sister) for an image of Jesus, Eusebius denied the request, replying: &quot;To depict purely the human form of Christ before its transformation, on the other hand, is to break the commandment of God and to fall into pagan error.&quot; Hence Jaroslav Pelikan calls Eusebius &quot;the father of iconoclasm&quot;.

After the emperor Constantine I extended official toleration of Christianity within the Roman Empire in 313, huge numbers of pagans became converts. This period of the Historiography of Christianization of the Roman Empire probably saw the use of Christian images become very widespread among the faithful, though with great differences from pagan habits. Robin Lane Fox states &quot;By the early fifth century, we know of the ownership of private icons of saints; by , we can be sure that the inside of a saint&#x27;s shrine would be adorned with images and votive portraits, a practice which had probably begun earlier.&quot;

When Constantine himself () apparently converted to Christianity, the majority of his subjects remained pagans. The Roman Imperial cult of the divinity of the emperor, expressed through the traditional burning of candles and the offering of incense to the emperor&#x27;s image, was tolerated for a period because it would have been politically dangerous to attempt to suppress it. In the 5th century the courts of justice and municipal buildings of the empire still honoured the portrait of the reigning emperor in this way.

In 425 Philostorgius, an allegedly Arian Christian, charged the Orthodox Christians in Constantinople with idolatry because they still honored the image of the emperor Constantine the Great in this way. Dix notes that this occurred more than a century before the first extant reference to a similar honouring of the image of Jesus or of his apostles or saints known today, but that it would seem a natural progression for the image of Christ, the King of Heaven and Earth, to be paid similar veneration as that given to the earthly Roman emperor. However, the Orthodox, Eastern Catholics, and other groups insist on explicitly distinguishing the veneration of icons from the worship of idols by pagans.

===Theodosius to Justinian===
After adoption of Christianity as the only permissible Roman state religion under Theodosius I, Christian art began to change not only in quality and sophistication, but also in nature. This was in no small part due to Christians being free for the first time to express their faith openly without persecution from the state, in addition to the faith spreading to the non-poor segments of society. Paintings of martyrs and their feats began to appear, and early writers commented on their lifelike effect, one of the elements a few Christian writers criticized in pagan art—the ability to imitate life. The writers mostly criticized pagan works of art for pointing to false gods, thus encouraging idolatry. Statues in the round were avoided as being too close to the principal artistic focus of pagan cult practices, as they have continued to be (with some small-scale exceptions) throughout the history of Eastern Christianity.

Nilus of Sinai ( ), in his &quot;Letter to Heliodorus Silentiarius&quot;, records a miracle in which Saint Plato of Ankyra appeared to a Christian in a dream. The saint was recognized because the young man had often seen his portrait. This recognition of a religious apparition from likeness to an image was also a characteristic of pagan pious accounts of appearances of gods to humans, and was a regular &quot;topos&quot; in hagiography. One critical recipient of a vision from Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki apparently specified that the saint resembled the &quot;more ancient&quot; images of him—presumably the 7th-century mosaics still in Hagios Demetrios. Another, an African bishop, had been rescued from Arab slavery by a young soldier called Demetrios, who told him to go to his house in Thessaloniki. Having discovered that most young soldiers in the city seemed to be called Demetrios, he gave up and went to the largest church in the city, to find his rescuer on the wall.

During this period the church began to discourage all non-religious human images—the Emperor and donor figures counting as religious. This became largely effective, so that most of the population would only ever see religious images and those of the ruling class. The word &quot;icon&quot; referred to any and all images, not just religious ones, but there was barely a need for a separate word for these.

===Luke&#x27;s portrait of Mary===
It is in a context attributed to the 5th century that the first mention of an image of Mary painted from life appears, though earlier paintings on catacomb walls bear resemblance to modern icons of Mary. Theodorus Lector, in his 6th-century &quot;History of the Church&quot; 1:1 stated that Eudokia (wife of emperor Theodosius II, 460) sent an image of the &quot;Mother of God&quot; named Icon of the Hodegetria from Jerusalem to Pulcheria, daughter of Arcadius, the former emperor and father of Theodosius II. The image was specified to have been &quot;painted by the Apostle Luke.&quot;

Margherita Guarducci relates a tradition that the original icon of Mary attributed to Luke, sent by Eudokia to Pulcheria from Palestine, was a large circular icon only of her head. When the icon arrived in Constantinople it was fitted in as the head into a very large rectangular icon of her holding the Christ child and it is this composite icon that became the one historically known as the Hodegetria. She further states another tradition that when the last Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Baldwin II, fled Constantinople in 1261 he took this original circular portion of the icon with him.

This remained in the possession of the Angevin dynasty who had it inserted into a much larger image of Mary and the Christ child, which is presently enshrined above the high altar of the Benedictine Abbey church of Montevergine. This icon was subjected to repeated repainting over the subsequent centuries, so that it is difficult to determine what the original image of Mary&#x27;s face would have looked like. Guarducci states that in 1950 an ancient image of Mary at the Church of Santa Francesca Romana was determined to be a very exact, but reverse mirror image of the original circular icon that was made in the 5th century and brought to Rome, where it has remained until the present.

In later tradition the number of icons of Mary attributed to Luke greatly multiplied. The Salus Populi Romani, the Theotokos of Vladimir, the Theotokos Iverskaya of Mount Athos, the Theotokos of Tikhvin, the Theotokos of Smolensk and the Black Madonna of Częstochowa are examples, and another is in the cathedral on St Thomas Mount, which is believed to be one of the seven painted by Luke the Evangelist and brought to India by Thomas the Apostle. Ethiopia has at least seven more. Bissera V. Pentcheva concludes, &quot;The myth [of Luke painting an icon] was invented in order to support the legitimacy of icon veneration during the Iconoclastic controversy&quot; (8th and 9th centuries, much later than most art historians put it). According to Reformed Baptist pastor John Carpenter, by claiming the existence of a portrait of the Theotokos painted during her lifetime by the evangelist Luke, the iconodules &quot;fabricated evidence for the apostolic origins and divine approval of images.&quot;

In the period before and during the Iconoclastic Controversy, stories attributing the creation of icons to the New Testament period greatly increased, with several apostles and even Mary herself believed to have acted as the artist or commissioner of images (also embroidered in the case of Mary).

===Iconoclast period===

There was a continuing opposition to images and their misuse within Christianity from very early times. &quot;Whenever images threatened to gain undue influence within the church, theologians have sought to strip them of their power&quot;. Further, &quot;there is no century between the fourth and the eighth in which there is not some evidence of opposition to images even within the Church&quot;. Nonetheless, popular favor for icons guaranteed their continued existence, while no systematic apologia for or against icons, or doctrinal authorization or condemnation of icons yet existed.

The use of icons was seriously challenged by Byzantine Imperial authority in the 8th century. Though by this time opposition to images was strongly entrenched in Judaism and Islam, attribution of the impetus toward an iconoclastic movement in Eastern Orthodoxy to Muslims or Jews &quot;seems to have been highly exaggerated, both by contemporaries and by modern scholars&quot;.

Though significant in the history of religious doctrine, the Byzantine controversy over images is not seen as of primary importance in Byzantine history; &quot;[f]ew historians still hold it to have been the greatest issue of the period&quot;.

The Iconoclastic period began when images were banned by Emperor Leo III the Isaurian sometime between 726 and 730. Under his son Constantine V, a council forbidding image veneration was held at Hieria near Constantinople in 754. Image veneration was later reinstated by the Empress Regent Irene, under whom another council was held reversing the decisions of the previous iconoclast council and taking its title as Seventh Ecumenical Council. The council anathemized all who hold to iconoclasm, i.e. those who held that veneration of images constitutes idolatry. Then the ban was enforced again by Leo V in 815. Finally, icon veneration was decisively restored by Empress Regent Theodora in 843 at the Council of Constantinople.

From then on all Byzantine coins had a religious image or symbol on the reverse, usually an image of Christ for larger denominations, with the head of the Emperor on the obverse, reinforcing the bond of the state and the divine order.

The tradition of (, literally &#x27;not-made-by-hand&#x27;) accrued to icons that are alleged to have come into existence miraculously, not by a human painter. Such images functioned as powerful relics as well as icons, and their images were naturally seen as authoritative as to the true appearance of the subject: naturally and especially because of the reluctance to accept mere human productions as embodying anything of the divine, a commonplace of Christian deprecation of man-made &quot;idols&quot;. Like icons believed to be painted directly from the live subject, they therefore acted as important references for other images in the tradition. Beside the developed legend of the &quot;mandylion&quot; or Image of Edessa was the tale of the Veil of Veronica, whose very name signifies &quot;true icon&quot; or &quot;true image&quot;, the fear of a &quot;false image&quot; remaining strong.

==Stylistic developments==

Although there are earlier records of their use, no panel icons earlier than the few from the 6th century preserved at the Greek Orthodox Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery in Egypt survive, as the other examples in Rome have all been drastically over-painted. The surviving evidence for the earliest depictions of Christ, Mary and saints therefore comes from wall-paintings, mosaics and some carvings. They are realistic in appearance, in contrast to the later stylization. They are broadly similar in style, though often much superior in quality, to the mummy portraits done in wax (encaustic) and found at Fayyum in Egypt.

As can be judged from such items, the first depictions of Jesus were generic, rather than portrait images, generally representing him as a beardless young man. It was some time before the earliest examples of the long-haired, bearded face that was later to become standardized as the image of Jesus appeared. When they did begin to appear there was still variation. Augustine of Hippo (354–430) said that no one knew the appearance of Jesus or that of Mary. However, Augustine was not a resident of the Holy Land and therefore was not familiar with the local populations and their oral traditions. Gradually, paintings of Jesus took on characteristics of portrait images.

At this time the manner of depicting Jesus was not yet uniform, and there was some controversy over which of the two most common icons was to be favored. The first or &quot;Semitic&quot; form showed Jesus with short and &quot;frizzy&quot; hair; the second showed a bearded Jesus with hair parted in the middle, the manner in which the god Zeus was depicted. Theodorus Lector remarked that of the two, the one with short and frizzy hair was &quot;more authentic&quot;. To support his assertion, he relates a story (excerpted by John of Damascus) that a pagan commissioned to paint an image of Jesus used the &quot;Zeus&quot; form instead of the &quot;Semitic&quot; form, and that as punishment his hands withered.

Though their development was gradual, it is possible to date the full-blown appearance and general ecclesiastical (as opposed to simply popular or local) acceptance of Christian images as venerated and miracle-working objects to the 6th century, when, as Hans Belting writes, &quot;we first hear of the church&#x27;s use of religious images&quot;. &quot;As we reach the second half of the sixth century, we find that images are attracting direct veneration and some of them are credited with the performance of miracles&quot;. Cyril Mango writes, &quot;In the post-Justinianic period the icon assumes an ever increasing role in popular devotion, and there is a proliferation of miracle stories connected with icons, some of them rather shocking to our eyes&quot;. However, the earlier references by Eusebius and Irenaeus indicate veneration of images and reported miracles associated with them as early as the 2nd century.

==Symbolism==
In the icons of Eastern Orthodoxy, and of the early Medieval West, very little room is made for artistic license. Almost everything within the image has a symbolic aspect. Christ, the saints, and the angels all have halos. Angels (and often John the Baptist) have wings because they are messengers. Figures have consistent facial appearances, hold attributes personal to them, and use a few conventional poses. Archangels bear a thin staff and sometimes a mirror.

Colour plays an important role as well. Gold represents the radiance of Heaven; red, divine life. Blue is the colour of human life, white is the Uncreated Light of God, only used for resurrection and transfiguration of Christ. In icons of Jesus and Mary, Jesus wears red undergarment with a blue outer garment (representing God becoming human) and Mary wears a blue undergarment with a red overgarment (representing a human who was granted gifts by God), and thus the doctrine of deification is conveyed by icons. Letters are symbols too. Most icons incorporate some calligraphic text naming the person or event depicted. Even this is often presented in a stylized manner.

==Palladium and miracles==


The historical tradition of icons used for purposes other than visual depiction are the Palladium (protective image), the Palladium (classical antiquity), the , and various &quot;folk&quot; traditions associated with folk religion. Of these various forms the oldest tradition dates back to before the Christian era among the ancient Greeks. The various &quot;folk&quot; traditions are more poorly documented and often are associated with local folk narratives of uncertain origin.

In English, since around 1600, the word &quot;palladium&quot; has been used figuratively to mean anything believed to provide protection or safety, and in particular in Christian contexts a sacred relic or icon believed to have a protective role in military contexts for a whole city, people or nation. Such beliefs first become prominent in the Eastern Churches in the period after the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I, and later spread to the Western church. Palladia were processed around the walls of besieged cities and sometimes carried into battle.

==Eastern Orthodox teaching==
The Eastern Orthodox view of the origin of icons is generally quite different from that of most secular scholars and from some in contemporary Roman Catholic circles: &quot;The Orthodox Church maintains and teaches that the sacred image has existed from the beginning of Christianity&quot;, Léonid Ouspensky has written. Accounts that some non-Orthodox writers consider legendary are accepted as history within Eastern Orthodoxy, because they are a part of church tradition. Thus accounts such as that of the miraculous &quot;image not made by hands&quot;, and the weeping and moving &quot;Mother of God of the Sign&quot; of Novgorod are accepted as fact: &quot;Church Tradition tells us, for example, of the existence of an Icon of the Savior during His lifetime (the &#x27;Icon-Made-Without-Hands&#x27;) and of Icons of the Most-Holy Theotokos [Mary] immediately after Him.&quot;

Eastern Orthodoxy further teaches that &quot;a clear understanding of the importance of Icons&quot; was part of the church from its very beginning, and has never changed, although explanations of their importance may have developed over time. This is because icon painting is rooted in the theology of the Incarnation (Christ being the of God) which did not change, though its subsequent clarification within the Church occurred over the period of the first seven Ecumenical Councils. Icons also served as tools of edification for the illiterate faithful during most of the history of Christendom. Thus, icons are words in painting; they refer to the history of salvation and to its manifestation in concrete persons. In the Orthodox Church, &quot;icons have always been understood as a visible gospel, as a testimony to the great things given man by God the incarnate Logos&quot;. In the Council of 860 it was stated that &quot;all that is uttered in words written in syllables is also proclaimed in the language of colors&quot;.

Eastern Orthodox find the first instance of an image or icon in the Bible when God made man in his own image (Septuagint Greek ), in Genesis 1:26–27. In Exodus, God commanded that the Israelites not make any graven image; soon afterwards, however, he commanded that they make graven images of cherubim and other like things, both as statues and woven on tapestries. Later, Solomon included still more such imagery when he built the first temple. Eastern Orthodox believe these qualify as icons, in that they were visible images depicting heavenly beings and, in the case of the cherubim, used to indirectly indicate God&#x27;s presence above the Ark.

In the Book of Numbers it is written that God told Moses to make a bronze serpent, &quot;Nehushtan&quot;, and hold it up, so that anyone looking at the snake would be healed of their snake bites. In John 3, Jesus refers to the same serpent, saying that he must be lifted up in the same way that the serpent was. John of Damascus also regarded the brazen serpent as an icon. Further, Jesus Christ himself is called the &quot;image of the invisible God&quot; in Colossians 1:15, and is therefore in one sense an icon. As people are also made in God&#x27;s images, people are also considered to be living icons, and are therefore &quot;censed&quot; along with painted icons during Orthodox prayer services.

According to John of Damascus, anyone who tries to destroy icons &quot;is the enemy of Christ, the Holy Mother of God and the saints, and is the defender of the Devil and his demons&quot;. This is because the theology behind icons is closely tied to the Incarnational theology of the humanity and divinity of Jesus, so that attacks on icons typically have the effect of undermining or attacking the Incarnation of Jesus himself as elucidated in the Ecumenical Councils.

Basil of Caesarea, in his writing &quot;On the Holy Spirit&quot;, says: &quot;The honor paid to the image passes to the prototype&quot;. He also illustrates the concept by saying, &quot;If I point to a statue of Caesar and ask you &#x27;Who is that?&#x27;, your answer would properly be, &#x27;It is Caesar.&#x27; When you say such you do not mean that the stone itself is Caesar, but rather, the name and honor you ascribe to the statue passes over to the original, the archetype, Caesar himself.&quot; This is thus the approach to icons; to kiss an icon of Jesus, in the Eastern Orthodox view, is to show love towards Jesus himself, not mere wood and paint making up the physical substance of the icon. Worship of the icon as somehow entirely separate from its prototype is expressly forbidden by the Seventh Ecumenical Council.

Icons are often illuminated with a candle or jar of oil with a wick. (Beeswax for candles and olive oil for oil lamps are preferred because they burn very cleanly, although other materials are sometimes used.) The illumination of religious images with lamps or candles is an ancient practice pre-dating Christianity.

According to Fr. Les Bundy, &quot;The Ecumenical Counciliar dogmatic decrees on icons refer, in fact, to all religious images including three-dimensional statues. Professor Sergios Verkhovskoi, the conservative professor of dogmatics at St. Vladimir’s Seminary forthrightly condemns as heretical anyone who declares statues as unorthodox or in any way canonically inferior to paintings.&quot; Historically, the Orthodox Church has always approved of veneration of statues, for example, the statue of the Mother of God at Sokolica Monastery in Serbia, the devotional statues of St. Nil Stolbensky, and those of St. Paraskeva.

==Icon painting tradition by region==
===Byzantine Empire===

Of the icon painting tradition that developed in Byzantium, with Constantinople as the chief city, we have only a few icons from the 11th century and none preceding them, in part because of the Iconoclastic reforms during which many were destroyed or lost, and also because of plundering by the Republic of Venice in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, and finally the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.

It was only in the Komnenian period (1081–1185) that the cult of the icon became widespread in the Byzantine world, partly on account of the dearth of richer materials (such as mosaics, ivory, and vitreous enamels), but also because an &quot;iconostasis&quot; a special screen for icons was introduced then in ecclesiastical practice. The style of the time was severe, hieratic and distant.

In the late Comnenian period this severity softened, and emotion, formerly avoided, entered icon painting. Major monuments for this change include the murals at Daphni Monastery () and the Church of St. Panteleimon near Skopje (1164). The Theotokos of Vladimir () is probably the most representative example of the new trend towards spirituality and emotion.

The tendency toward emotionalism in icons continued in the Paleologan period, which began in 1261. Palaiologan art reached its pinnacle in mosaics such as those of Chora Church. In the last half of the 14th century, Palaiologan saints were painted in an exaggerated manner, very slim and in contorted positions – a style known as the Palaiologan Mannerism, of which Ochrid&#x27;s Annunciation is a superb example.

After 1453, the Byzantine tradition was carried on in regions previously influenced by its religion and culture—in the Balkans, Russia, and other Slavic countries, Georgia and Armenia in the Caucasus, and among Eastern Orthodox minorities in the Islamic world. In the Greek-speaking world Crete, ruled by Venice until the mid-17th century, was an important centre of painted icons, as home of the Cretan School, exporting many to Europe.

===Crete===
Crete was under Venetian control from 1204 and became a thriving center of art with eventually a , or organized painter&#x27;s guild, the Guild of Saint Luke, on Western lines. Cretan painting was heavily patronized both by Catholics of Venetian territories and by Eastern Orthodox. For ease of transport, Cretan painters specialized in panel paintings, and developed the ability to work in many styles to fit the taste of various patrons. El Greco, who moved to Venice after establishing his reputation in Crete, is the most famous artist of the school, who continued to use many Byzantine conventions in his works. In 1669 the city of Heraklion, on Crete, which at one time boasted at least 120 painters, fell to the Turks. From that time Greek icon painting went into a decline, with a revival attempted in the 20th century by art reformers such as Photis Kontoglou, who emphasized a return to earlier styles.

===Russia===

Russian icons are typically paintings on wood, often small, though some in churches and monasteries may be as large as a table top. Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the —the &quot;red&quot; corner (see Icon corner). There is a rich history and elaborate religious symbolism associated with icons. In Russian churches, the nave is typically separated from the sanctuary by an &quot;iconostasis&quot;, a wall of icons.

The use and making of icons entered Kievan Rus&#x27; following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians—notably Andrei Rublev and Dionisius—widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the 17th century, when Simon Ushakov&#x27;s painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.

In the mid-17th century, changes in liturgy and practice instituted by Patriarch Nikon of Moscow resulted in a split in the Russian Orthodox Church. The traditionalists, the persecuted &quot;Old Ritualists&quot; or &quot;Old Believers&quot;, continued the traditional stylization of icons, while the State Church modified its practice. From that time icons began to be painted not only in the traditional stylized and nonrealistic mode, but also in a mixture of Russian stylization and Western European realism, and in a Western European manner very much like that of Catholic religious art of the time. The Stroganov school and the icons from Nevyansk rank among the last important schools of Russian icon-painting.

=== Romania ===
In Romania, icons painted as reversed images behind glass and set in frames were common in the 19th century and are still made. The process is known as reverse glass painting. &quot;In the Transylvanian countryside, the expensive icons on panels imported from Moldavia, Wallachia, and Mt. Athos were gradually replaced by small, locally produced icons on glass, which were much less expensive and thus accessible to the Transylvanian peasants&quot;.

===Serbia===

The earliest historical records about icons in Serbia dates back to the period of Nemanjić dynasty. One of the notable schools of Serb icons was active in the Bay of Kotor from the 17th century to the 19th century.

Trojeručica meaning &quot;Three-handed Theotokos&quot; is the most important icon of the Serbian Orthodox Church and main icon of Mount Athos.

===Egypt and Ethiopia===
The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and Oriental Orthodoxy also have distinctive, living icon painting traditions. Coptic icons have their origin in the Hellenistic art of Egyptian Late Antiquity, as exemplified by the Fayum mummy portraits. Beginning in the 4th century, churches painted their walls and made icons to reflect an authentic expression of their faith.

===Aleppo===

The Aleppo School was a school of icon-painting, founded by the priest Yusuf al-Musawwir (also known as Joseph the Painter) and active in Aleppo, which was then a part of the Ottoman Empire, between at least 1645 and 1777.

==Western Christianity==
Although the word &quot;icon&quot; is not generally used in Western Christianity, there are religious works of art which were largely patterned on Byzantine works, and equally conventional in composition and depiction. Until the 13th century, icon-like depictions of sacred figures followed Eastern patterns—although very few survive from this early period. Italian examples are in a style known as Italo-Byzantine.

From the 13th century, the Western tradition came slowly to allow the artist far more flexibility, and a more realist approach to the figures. If only because there was a much smaller number of skilled artists, the quantity of works of art, in the sense of panel paintings, was much smaller in the West, and in most Western settings a single diptych as an altarpiece, or in a domestic room, probably stood in place of the larger collections typical of Orthodox &quot;icon corners&quot;.

Only in the 15th century did production of painted works of art begin to approach Eastern levels, supplemented by mass-produced imports from the Cretan School. In this century, the use of icon-like portraits in the West was enormously increased by the introduction of old master prints on paper, mostly woodcuts which were produced in vast numbers (although hardly any survive). They were mostly sold, hand-coloured, by churches, and the smallest sizes (often only an inch high) were affordable even by peasants, who glued or pinned them straight onto a wall.

With the Reformation, after an initial uncertainty among early Lutherans, who painted a few icon-like depictions of leading Reformers, and continued to paint scenes from Scripture, Protestants came down firmly against icon-like portraits, especially larger ones, even of Christ. Many Protestants found these idolatrous.

===Catholic Church view===
The Catholic Church accepted the decrees of the iconodule Seventh Ecumenical Council regarding images. There is some minor difference, however, in the Catholic attitude to images from that of the Orthodox. Following Gregory the Great, Catholics emphasize the role of images as the , the &quot;Bible of the Poor&quot;, from which those who could not read could nonetheless learn.

Catholics also, however, share the same viewpoint with the Orthodox when it comes to image veneration, believing that whenever approached, sacred images are to be shown reverence. Though using both flat wooden panel and stretched canvas paintings, Catholics traditionally have also favored images in the form of three-dimensional statuary, whereas in the East, statuary is much less widely employed.

===Lutheran view===
A joint Lutheran–Orthodox statement made in the 7th Plenary of the Lutheran–Orthodox Joint Commission, in July 1993 in Helsinki, reaffirmed the ecumenical council decisions on the nature of Christ and the veneration of images:

<doc id="14801" wikidata="Q1156474" url="?curid=14801" title="Icon (programming language)">
<text>Icon is a very high-level programming language based on the concept of &quot;goal-directed execution&quot; in which code returns a &quot;success&quot; along with valid values, or a &quot;failure&quot;, indicating that there is no valid data to return. The success and failure of a given block of code is used to direct further processing, whereas conventional languages would typically use Boolean logic written by the programmer to achieve the same ends. Because the logic for basic control structures is often implicit in Icon, common tasks can be completed with less explicit code.

Icon was designed by Ralph Griswold after leaving Bell Labs where he was a major contributor to the SNOBOL language. SNOBOL was a string-processing language with what would be considered dated syntax by the standards of the early 1970s. After moving to the University of Arizona, he further developed the underlying SNOBOL concepts in SL5, but considered the result to be a failure. This led to the significantly updated Icon, which blends the short but conceptually dense code of SNOBOL-like languages with the more familiar syntax of ALGOL-inspired languages like C or Pascal.

Like the languages that inspired it, the primary area of use of Icon is managing strings and textual patterns. String operations often fail, for instance, finding &quot;the&quot; in &quot;world&quot;. In most languages, this requires testing and branching to avoid using a non-valid result. In Icon most of these sorts of tests are simply unneeded, reducing the amount of code that must be written. Complex pattern handling can be done in a few lines of terse code, similar to more dedicated languages like Perl but retaining a more function-oriented syntax familiar to users of other ALGOL-like languages.

Icon is not object-oriented, but an object-oriented extension named Idol was developed in 1996 which eventually became Unicon. It also inspired other languages, with its simple generators being especially influential; Icon&#x27;s generators were a major inspiration for the Python language.

==History==
===SNOBOL===
The original SNOBOL effort, retroactively known as SNOBOL1, launched in the fall of 1962 at the Bell Labs Programming Research Studies Department. The effort was a reaction to the frustrations of attempting to use the SCL language for polynomial formula manipulation, symbolic integration and studying Markov chains. SCL, written by the department head Chester Lee, was both slow and had a low-level syntax that resulting in volumes of code for even simple projects. After briefly considering the COMIT language, Ivan Polonsky, Ralph Griswold and David Farber, all members of the six-person department, decided to write their own language to solve these problems.

The first versions were running on the IBM 7090 in early 1963, and by the summer had been built out and was being used across Bell. This led almost immediately to SNOBOL2, which added a number of built-in functions, and the ability to link to external assembly language code. It was released in April 1964 and mostly used within Bell, but also saw some use at Project MAC. The introduction of system functions served mostly to indicate the need for user functions, which was the major feature of SNOBOL3, released in July 1964.

SNOBOL3&#x27;s introduction corresponded with major changes within the Bell Labs computing department, including the addition of the new GE 645 mainframe which would require a rewrite of SNOBOL. Instead, the team suggested writing a new version that would run on a virtual machine, named SIL for SNOBOL Intermediate Language, allowing it to be easily ported to any sufficiently powerful platform. This proposal was accepted as SNOBOL4 in September 1965. By this time, plans for a significantly improved version of the language emerged in August 1966. Further work on the language continued throughout the rest of the 1960s, notably adding the associative array type in later version, which they referred to as a table.

===SL5 leads to Icon===
Griswold left Bell Labs to become a professor at the University of Arizona in August 1971. He introduced SNOBOL4 as a research tool at that time. He received grants from the National Science Foundation to continue supporting and evolving SNOBOL.

As a language originally developed in the early 1960s, SNOBOL&#x27;s syntax bears the marks of other early programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL. In particular, the language is column-dependant, as many of these languages were entered on punch cards where column layout is natural. Additionally, control structures were almost entirely based on branching around code rather than the use of blocks, which were becoming a must-have feature after the introduction of ALGOL 60. By the time he moved to Arizona, the syntax of SNOBOL4 was hopelessly outdated.

Griswold began the effort of implementing SNOBOL&#x27;s underlying success/failure concept with traditional flow control structures like if/then. This became SL5, short for &quot;SNOBOL Language 5&quot;, but the result was unsatisfying. In 1977, he returned to the language to consider a new version. He abandoned the very powerful function system introduced in SL5 with a simpler concept of suspend/resume and developed a new concept for the natural successor to SNOBOL4 with the following principles;

* SNOBOL4&#x27;s philosophic and sematic basis
* SL5 syntactic basis
* SL5 features, excluding the generalized procedure mechanism

The new language was initially known as SNOBOL5, but as it was significantly different from SNOBOL in all but the underlying concept, a new name was ultimately desired. After considering &quot;s&quot; as a sort of homage to &quot;C&quot;, but this was ultimately abandoned due to the problems with typesetting documents using that name. A series of new names were proposed and abandoned; Irving, bard, and &quot;TL&quot; for &quot;The Language&quot;. It was at this time that Xerox PARC began publishing about their work on graphical user interfaces and the term &quot;icon&quot; began to enter the computer lexicon. The decision was made to change the name initially to &quot;icon&quot; before finally choosing &quot;Icon&quot;.

==Language==
===Basic syntax===
The Icon language is derived from the ALGOL-class of structured programming languages, and thus has syntax similar to C or Pascal. Icon is most similar to Pascal, using syntax for assignments, the keyword and similar syntax. On the other hand, Icon uses C-style braces for structuring execution groups, and programs start by running a procedure called .

In many ways Icon also shares features with most scripting languages (as well as SNOBOL and SL5, from which they were taken): variables do not have to be declared, types are cast automatically, and numbers can be converted to strings and back automatically. Another feature common to many scripting languages, but not all, is the lack of a line-ending character; in Icon, lines that do not end with a semicolon get ended by an implied semicolon if it makes sense.

Procedures are the basic building blocks of Icon programs. Although they use Pascal naming, they work more like C functions and can return values; there is no keyword in Icon.
 procedure doSomething(aString)
 write(aString)
 end
===Goal-directed execution===
One of the key concepts in SNOBOL was that its functions returned the &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; as primitives of the language rather than using magic numbers or other techniques.

For example, a function that returns the position of a substring within another string is a common routine found in most language runtime systems. In JavaScript to find the position of the word &quot;World&quot; within a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program would be accomplished with , which would return 7 in the variable . If one instead asks for the the code will &quot;fail&quot;, as the search term does not appear in the string. In JavaScript, as in most languages, this will be indicated by returning a magic number, in this case -1.

In SNOBOL a failure of this sort returns a special value, . SNOBOL&#x27;s syntax operates directly on the success or failure of the operation, jumping to labelled sections of the code without having to write a separate test. For instance, the following code prints &quot;Hello, world!&quot; five times:
* SNOBOL program to print Hello World
 I = 1
LOOP OUTPUT = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
 I = I + 1
 LE(I, 5) : S(LOOP)
END
To perform the loop, the less-than-or-equal operator, , is called on the index variable I, and if it ucceeds, meaning I is less than 5, it branches to the named label and continues.

Icon retained the concept of flow control based on success or failure but developed the language further. One change was the replacement of the labelled -like branching with block-oriented structures in keeping with the structured programming style that was sweeping the computer industry in the late 1960s. The second was to allow &quot;failure&quot; to be passed along the call chain so that entire blocks will succeed or fail as a whole. This is a key concept of the Icon language. Whereas in traditional languages one would have to include code to test the success or failure based on Boolean logic and then branch based on the outcome, such tests and branches are inherent to Icon code and do not have to be explicitly written.

For instance, consider this bit of code written in the Java programming language. It calls the function to read a character from a (previously opened) file, assigns the result to the variable , and then s the value of to another file. The result is to copy one file to another. will eventually run out of characters to read from the file, potentially on its very first call, which would leave in an undetermined state and potentially cause to cause a null pointer exception. To avoid this, returns the special value (end-of-file) in this situation, which requires an explicit test to avoid ing it:
 while ((a = read()) != EOF) {
 write(a);


In contrast, in Icon the function returns a line of text or . is not simply an analog of , as it is explicitly understood by the language to mean &quot;stop processing&quot; or &quot;do the fail case&quot; depending on the context. The equivalent code in Icon is:
 while a := read() do write(a)
This means, &quot;as long as read does not fail, call write, otherwise stop&quot;. There is no need to specify a test against the magic number as in the Java example, this is implicit, and the resulting code is simplified. Because success and failure are passed up through the call chain, one can embed function calls within others and they stop when the nested function call fails. For instance, the code above can be reduced to:
 while write(read())
In this version, if the call fails, the call fails, and the stops. Icon&#x27;s branching and looping constructs are all based on the success or failure of the code inside them, not on an arbitrary Boolean test provided by the programmer. performs the block if its &quot;test&quot; returns a value, and performs the block or moves to the next line if it returns . Likewise, continues calling its block until it receives a fail. Icon refers to this concept as goal-directed execution.

It is important to contrast the concept of success and failure with the concept of an exception; exceptions are unusual situations, not expected outcomes. Fails in Icon are expected outcomes; reaching the end of a file is an expected situation and not an exception. Icon does not have exception handling in the traditional sense, although fail is often used in exception-like situations. For instance, if the file being read does not exist, fails without a special situation being indicated. In traditional language, these &quot;other conditions&quot; have no natural way of being indicated; additional magic numbers may be used, but more typically exception handling is used to &quot;throw&quot; a value. For instance, to handle a missing file in the Java code, one might see:
 try {
 while ((a = read()) != EOF) {
 write(a);
 } catch (Exception e) {
 // something else went wrong, use this catch to exit the loop


This case needs two comparisons: one for EOF and another for all other errors. Since Java does not allow exceptions to be compared as logic elements, as under Icon, the lengthy syntax must be used instead. Try blocks also impose a performance penalty even if no exception is thrown, a distributed cost that Icon normally avoids.

Icon uses this same goal-directed mechanism to perform traditional Boolean tests, although with subtle differences. A simple comparison like does not mean, &quot;if the conditional expression evaluation results in or returns a true value&quot; as they would under most languages; instead, it means something more like, &quot;if the conditional expression succeeds and does not fail&quot;. In this case, the operator succeeds if the comparison is true. The calls its clause if the expression succeeds, and either the (if present) or the next line if it fails. The result is similar to the traditional if/then seen in other languages, the performs if is less than . The subtlety is that the same comparison expression can be placed anywhere, for instance:
 write(a &lt; b)
Another difference is that the operator returns its second argument if it succeeds, which in this example will result in the value of being written if it is larger than , otherwise nothing is written. As this is not a test &quot;per se&quot;, but an operator that returns a value, they can be strung together allowing things like , a common type of comparison that in most languages must be written as a conjunction of two inequalities like .

A key aspect of goal-directed execution is that the program may have to rewind to an earlier state if a procedure fails, a task known as &quot;backtracking&quot;. For instance, consider code that sets a variable to a starting location and then performs operations that may change the value - this is common in string scanning operations for instance, which will advance a cursor through the string as it scans. If the procedure fails, it is important that any subsequent reads of that variable return the original state, not the state as it was being internally manipulated. For this task, Icon has the &quot;reversible assignment&quot; operator, , and the &quot;reversible exchange&quot;, . For instance, consider some code that is attempting to find a pattern string within a larger string:
 {
 (i := 10) &amp;
 (j := (i &lt; find(pattern, inString)))


This code begins by moving to 10, the starting location for the search. However, if the fails, the block will fail as a whole, which results in the value of being left at 10 as an undesirable side effect. Replacing with indicates that should be reset to its previous value if the block fails. This provides an analog of atomicity in the execution.

===Generators===
Expressions in Icon may return a single value, for instance, will evaluate and return x if the value of x is less than 5, otherwise it will fail and return no value. Icon also includes the concept of procedures that do not &quot;immediately&quot; return success or failure, and instead return new values every time they are called. These are known as &quot;generators&quot;, and are a key part of the Icon language. Within the parlance of Icon, the evaluation of an expression or function produces a &quot;result sequence&quot;. A result sequence contains all the possible values that can be generated by the expression or function. When the result sequence is exhausted, the expression or function fails.

Icon allows any procedure to return a single value or multiple values, controlled using the , and keywords. A procedure that lacks any of these keywords returns , which occurs whenever execution runs to the of a procedure. For instance:
 procedure f(x)
 if x &gt; 0 then {
 return 1
 end
Calling will return 1, but calling will return . This can lead to non-obvious behavior, for instance, will output nothing because fails and suspends operation of .

Converting a procedure to be a generator uses the keyword, which means &quot;return this value, and when called again, start execution at this point&quot;. In this respect it is something like a combination of the  concept in C and . For instance:
 procedure ItoJ(i, j)
 while i &lt;= j do {
 suspend i
 i +:= 1
 fail
 end
creates a generator that returns a series of numbers starting at and ending a , and then returns after that. The stops execution and returns the value of without reseting any of the state. When another call is made to the same function, execution picks up at that point with the previous values. In this case, that causes it to perform , loop back to the start of the while block, and then return the next value and suspend again. This continues until fails, at which point it exits the block and calls . This allows iterators to be constructed with ease.

Another type of generator-builder is the &quot;alternator&quot;, which looks and operates like the Boolean operator. For instance:
 if y &lt; (x | 5) then write(&quot;y=&quot;, y)
This appears to say &quot;if y is smaller than x or 5 then...&quot;, but is actually a short-form for a generator that returns values until it falls off the end of the list. The values of the list are &quot;injected&quot; into the operations, in this case, . So in this example, the system first tests y &lt; x, if x is indeed larger than y it returns the value of x, the test passes, and the value of y is written out in the clause. However, if x is not larger than y it fails, and the alternator continues, performing y &lt; 5. If that test passes, y is written. If y is smaller than neither x or 5, the alternator runs out of tests and fails, the fails, and the is not performed. Thus, the value of y will appear on the console if it is smaller than x or 5, thereby fulfilling the purpose of a Boolean . Functions will not be called unless evaluating their parameters succeeds, so this example can be shortened to:
 write(&quot;y=&quot;, (x | 5) &gt; y)
Internally, the alternator is not simply an and one can also use it to construct arbitrary lists of values. This can be used to iterate over arbitrary values, like:
 every i := (1|3|4|5|10|11|23) do write(i)
As lists of integers are commonly found in many programming contexts, Icon also includes the keyword to construct &quot;ad hoc&quot; integer generators:
 every k := i to j do write(k)
which can be shortened:
 every write(1 to 10)
Icon is not strongly typed, so the alternator lists can contain different types of items:
 every i := (1 | &quot;hello&quot; | x &lt; 5) do write(i)
This writes 1, &quot;hello&quot; and maybe 5 depending on the value of x.

Likewise the &quot;conjunction operator&quot;, , is used in a fashion similar to a Boolean operator:
 every x := ItoJ(0,10) &amp; x % 2 == 0 do write(x)
This code calls and returns an initial value of 0 which is assigned to x. It then performs the right-hand side of the conjunction, and since does equal 0, it writes out the value. It then calls the generator again which assigns 1 to x, which fails the right-hand-side and prints nothing. The result is a list of every even integer from 0 to 10.

The concept of generators is particularly useful and powerful when used with string operations, and is a major underlying basis for Icon&#x27;s overall design. Consider the operation found in many languages; this function looks for one string within another and returns an index of its location, or a magic number if it is not found. For instance:
 s = &quot;All the world&#x27;s a stage. And all the men and women merely players&quot;;
 i = indexOf(&quot;the&quot;, s);
 write(i);
This will scan the string , find the first occurrence of &quot;the&quot;, and return that index, in this case 4. The string, however, contains two instances of the string &quot;the&quot;, so to return the second example an alternate syntax is used:
 j = indexOf(&quot;the&quot;, s, i+1);
 write(j);
This tells it to scan starting at location 5, so it will not match the first instance we found previously. However, there may not be a second instance of &quot;the&quot; -there may not be a first one either- so the return value from has to be checked against the magic number -1 which is used to indicate no matches. A complete routine that prints out the location of every instance is:
 s = &quot;All the world&#x27;s a stage. And all the men and women merely players&quot;;
 i = indexOf(&quot;the&quot;, s);
 while i != -1 {
 write(i);
 i = indexOf(&quot;the&quot;, s, i+1);


In Icon, the equivalent is a generator, so the same results can be created with a single line:
 s := &quot;All the world&#x27;s a stage. And all the men and women merely players&quot;
 every write(find(&quot;the&quot;, s))
Of course there are times where one does want to find a string after some point in input, for instance, if scanning a text file that contains a line number in the first four columns, a space, and then a line of text. Goal-directed execution can be used to skip over the line numbers:
 every write(5 &lt; find(&quot;the&quot;, s))
The position will only be returned if &quot;the&quot; appears after position 5; the comparison will fail otherwise, pass the fail to write, and the write will not occur.

The operator is similar to , looping through every item returned by a generator and exiting on failure:
 every k := i to j do
 write(someFunction(k))
There is a key difference between and ; re-evaluates the first result until it fails, whereas fetches the next value from a generator. actually injects values into the function in a fashion similar to blocks under Smalltalk. For instance, the above loop can be re-written this way:
 every write(someFunction(i to j))
In this case, the values from i to j will be injected into and (potentially) write multiple lines of output.

===Collections===
Icon includes several collection types including lists that can also be used as stacks and queues, tables (also known as maps or dictionaries in other languages), sets and others. Icon refers to these as &quot;structures&quot;. Collections are inherent generators and can be easily called using the bang syntax. For instance:
 lines := [] # create an empty list
 while line := read() do { # loop reading lines from standard input
 push(lines, line) # use stack-like syntax to push the line on the list
 while line := pop(lines) do { # loop while lines can be popped off the list
 write(line) # write the line out


Using the fail propagation as seen in earlier examples, we can combine the tests and the loops:
 lines := [] # create an empty list
 while push(lines, read()) # push until empty
 while write(pop(lines)) # write until empty
Because the list collection is a generator, this can be further simplified with the bang syntax:
 lines := []
 every push(lines, !&amp;input)
 every write(!lines)
In this case, the bang in causes Icon to return a line of text one by one from the array and finally fail at the end. is a generator-based analog of that reads a line from standard input, so continues reading lines until the file ends.

As Icon is typeless, lists can contain any different types of values:

aCat := [&quot;muffins&quot;, &quot;tabby&quot;, 2002, 8]

The items can included other structures. To build larger lists, Icon includes the generator; generates a list containing 10 copies of &quot;word&quot;. Like arrays in other languages, Icon allows items to be looked up by position, e.g., . Array slicing is included, allowing new lists to be created out of the elements of other lists, for instance, produces a new list called aCat that contains &quot;tabby&quot; and 2002.

Tables are essentially lists with arbitrary index keys rather than integers:
 symbols := table(0)
 symbols[&quot;there&quot;] := 1
 symbols[&quot;here&quot;] := 2
This code creates a table that will use zero as the default value of any unknown key. It then adds two items into the table, with the keys &quot;there&quot; and &quot;here&quot;, and values 1 and 2.

Sets are also similar to lists but contain only a single member of any given value. Icon includes the to produce the union of two sets, the intersection, and the difference. Icon includes a number of pre-defined &quot;Cset&quot;s, a set containing various characters. There are four standard Csets in Icon, , , , and . New Csets can be made by enclosing a string in single quotes, for instance, .

===Strings===
In Icon, strings are lists of characters. As a list, they are generators and can thus be iterated over using the bang syntax:
 write(!&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
Will print out each character of the string on a separate line.

Substrings can be extracted from a string by using a range specification within brackets. A range specification can return a point to a single character, or a slice of the string. Strings can be indexed from either the right or the left. Positions within a string are defined to be between the characters 1A2B3C4 and can be specified from the right −3A−2B−1C0

For example,

 &quot;Wikipedia&quot;[1] ==&gt; &quot;W&quot;
 &quot;Wikipedia&quot;[3] ==&gt; &quot;k&quot;
 &quot;Wikipedia&quot;[0] ==&gt; &quot;a&quot;
 &quot;Wikipedia&quot;[1:3] ==&gt; &quot;Wi&quot;
 &quot;Wikipedia&quot;[-2:0] ==&gt; &quot;ia&quot;
 &quot;Wikipedia&quot;[2+:3] ==&gt; &quot;iki&quot;

Where the last example shows using a length instead of an ending position

The subscripting specification can be used as a lvalue within an expression. This can be used to insert strings into another string or delete parts of a string. For example:
 s := &quot;abc&quot;
 s[2] := &quot;123&quot;
 s now has a value of &quot;a123c&quot;
 s := &quot;abcdefg&quot;
 s[3:5] := &quot;ABCD&quot;
 s now has a value of &quot;abABCDefg&quot;
 s := &quot;abcdefg&quot;
 s[3:5] := &quot;&quot;
 s now has a value of &quot;abefg&quot;
===String scanning===
A further simplification for handling strings is the &quot;scanning&quot; system, invoked with , which calls functions on a string:
 s ? write(find(&quot;the&quot;))
Icon refers to the left-hand-side of the as the &quot;subject&quot;, and passes it into string functions. Recall the takes two parameters, the search text as parameter one and the string to search in parameter two. Using the second parameter is implicit and does not have to be specified by the programmer. In the common cases when multiple functions are being called on a single string in sequence, this style can significantly reduce the length of the resulting code and improve clarity. Icon function signatures identify the subject parameter in their definitions so the parameter can be hoisted in this fashion.

The is not simply a form of syntactic sugar, it also sets up a &quot;string scanning environment&quot; for any following string operations. This is based on two internal variables, and ; is simply a pointer to the original string, while is the current position within it, or cursor. Icon&#x27;s various string manipulation procedures use these two variables so they do not have to be explicitly supplied by the programmer. For example:
 s := &quot;this is a string&quot;
 s ? write(&quot;subject=[&quot;,&amp;subject,&quot;], pos=[&quot;,&amp;pos,&quot;]&quot;)
would produce:
subject=[this is a string], pos=[1]
Built-in and user-defined functions can be used to move around within the string being scanned. All of the built-in functions will default to and to allow the scanning syntax to be used. The following code will write all blank-delimited &quot;words&quot; in a string:
 s := &quot;this is a string&quot;
 s ? { # Establish string scanning environment
 while not pos(0) do { # Test for end of string
 tab(many(&#x27; &#x27;)) # Skip past any blanks
 word := tab(upto(&#x27; &#x27;) | 0) # the next word is up to the next blank -or- the end of the line
 write(word) # write the word

There are a number of new functions introduced in this example. returns the current value of . It may not be immediately obvious why one would need this function and not simply use the value of directly; the reason is that is a variable and thus cannot take on the value , which the procedure can. Thus provides a lightweight wrapper on that allows Icon&#x27;s goal-directed flow control to be easily used without having to provide hand-written Boolean tests against . In this case, the test is &quot;is &amp;pos zero&quot;, which, in the odd numbering of Icon&#x27;s string locations, is the end of the line. If it is &quot;not&quot; zero, returns , which is inverted with the and the loop continues.

In this case, it is looking for space characters, so the result of this function is the location of the first non-space character after . moves to that location, again with a potential in case, for instance, falls off the end of the string. is essentially the reverse of ; it returns the location immediately prior to its provided Cset, which the example then sets the to with another . Alternation is used to also stop at the end of a line.

This example can be made more robust through the use of a more appropriate &quot;word breaking&quot; Cset which might include periods, commas and other punctuation, as well as other whitespace characters like tab and non-breaking spaces. That Cset can then be used in and .

A more complex example demonstrates the integration of generators and string scanning within the language.
 procedure main()

 s ? write(Mdate() | &quot;not a valid date&quot;)

==Criticisms==
Laurence Tratt wrote a paper on Icon examining its real-world applications and pointing out a number of areas of concern. Among these were a number of practical decisions that derive from their origins in string processing but do not make as much sense in other areas. Among them:

The decision to fail by default at the end of procedures makes sense in the context of generators, but less so in the case of general procedures. Returning to the example noted above, will not output which may be expected. However:

 x := 10
 (additional lines)
 x := f(-1)
 write(x)

will result in 10 being printed. This sort of issue is not at all obvious as even in an interactive debugger all the code is invoked yet never picks up the expected value. This could be dismissed as one of those &quot;gotchas&quot; that programmers have to be aware of in any language, but Tratt examined a variety of Icon programs and found that the vast majority of procedures are not generators. This means that Icon&#x27;s default behaviour is only used by a tiny minority of its constructs, yet represents a major source of potential errors in all the others.

Another issue is the lack of a Boolean data type and conventional Boolean logic. While the success/fail system works in most cases where the ultimate goal is to check a value, this can still lead to some odd behaviour in seemingly simple code:

 procedure main()
 if c then {
 write(&quot;taken&quot;)
 end

This program will print &quot;taken&quot;. The reason is that the test, , does return a value; that value is , the default value for all otherwise uninitiated variables. is a valid value, so succeeds. To test this, one needs to make the test explicit, . Tratt supposed that it detracts from the self-documenting code, having supposed erroneously that it is testing &quot;is c zero&quot; or &quot;does c exist&quot;.

<text>Iconology is a method of interpretation in cultural history and the history of the visual arts used by Aby Warburg, Erwin Panofsky and their followers that uncovers the cultural, social, and historical background of themes and subjects in the visual arts. Though Panofsky differentiated between iconology and iconography, the distinction is not very widely followed, &quot;and they have never been given definitions accepted by all iconographers and iconologists&quot;. Few 21st-century authors continue to use the term &quot;iconology&quot; consistently, and instead use iconography to cover both areas of scholarship.

To those who use the term, iconology is derived from synthesis rather than scattered analysis and examines symbolic meaning on more than its face value by reconciling it with its historical context and with the artist&#x27;s body of work – in contrast to the widely descriptive iconography, which, as described by Panofsky, is an approach to studying the content and meaning of works of art that is primarily focused on classifying, establishing dates, provenance and other necessary fundamental knowledge concerning the subject matter of an artwork that is needed for further interpretation.

Panofsky&#x27;s &quot;use of iconology as the principal tool of art analysis brought him critics.&quot; For instance, in 1946, Jan Gerrit Van Gelder &quot;criticized Panofsky&#x27;s iconology as putting too much emphasis on the symbolic content of the work of art, neglecting its formal aspects and the work as a unity of form and content.&quot; Furthermore, iconology is mostly avoided by social historians who do not accept the theoretical dogmaticism in the work of Panofsky.

==In contrast to iconography==
Erwin Panofsky defines iconography as &quot;a known principle in the known world&quot;, while iconology is &quot;an iconography turned interpretive&quot;. According to his view, iconology tries to reveal the underlying principles that form the basic attitude of a nation, a period, a class, a religious or philosophical perspective, which is modulated by one personality and condensed into one work. According to Roelof van Straten, iconology &quot;can explain why an artist or patron chose a particular subject at a specific location and time and represented it in a certain way. An iconological investigation should concentrate on the social-historical, not art-historical, influences and values that the artist might not have consciously brought into play but are nevertheless present. The artwork is primarily seen as a document of its time.&quot;

Warburg used the term &quot;iconography&quot; in his early research, replacing it in 1908 with &quot;iconology&quot; in his particular method of visual interpretation called &quot;critical iconology&quot;, which focused on the tracing of motifs through different cultures and visual forms. In 1932, Panofsky published a seminal article, introducing a three-step method of visual interpretation dealing with (1) primary or natural subject matter; (2) secondary or conventional subject matter, i.e. iconography; (3) tertiary or intrinsic meaning or content, i.e. iconology. Whereas iconography analyses the world of images, stories and allegories and requires knowledge of literary sources, an understanding of the history of types and how themes and concepts were expressed by objects and events under different historical conditions, iconology interprets intrinsic meaning or content and the world of symbolical values by using &quot;synthetic intuition&quot;. The interpreter is aware of the essential tendencies of the human mind as conditioned by psychology and world view; he analyses the history of cultural symptoms or symbols, or how tendencies of the human mind were expressed by specific themes due to different historical conditions. Moreover, when understanding the work of art as a document of a specific civilization, or of a certain religious attitude therein, the work of art becomes a symptom of something else, which expresses itself in a variety of other symptoms. Interpreting these symbolical values, which can be unknown to, or different from, the artist&#x27;s intention, is the object of iconology. Panofsky emphasized that &quot;iconology can be done when there are no originals to look at and nothing but artificial light to work in.&quot;

According to Ernst Gombrich, &quot;the emerging discipline of iconology ... must ultimately do for the image what linguistics has done for the word.&quot; However, Michael Camille is of the opinion that &quot;though Panofsky&#x27;s concept of iconology has been very influential in the humanities and is quite effective when applied to Renaissance art, it is still problematic when applied to art from periods before and after.&quot;

==Nuances==
In 1952, Creighton Gilbert added another suggestion for a useful meaning of the word &quot;iconology&quot;. According to his view, iconology was not the actual investigation of the work of art but rather the result of this investigation. The Austrian art historian Hans Sedlmayr differentiated between &quot;sachliche&quot; and &quot;methodische&quot; iconology. &quot;Sachliche&quot; iconology refers to the &quot;general meaning of an individual painting or of an artistic complex (church, palace, monument) as seen and explained with reference to the ideas which take shape in them.&quot; In contrast, &quot;methodische&quot; iconology is the &quot;integral iconography which accounts for the changes and development in the representations&quot;. In &quot;Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology&quot; (1986), W.J.T. Mitchell writes that iconology is a study of &quot;what to say about images&quot;, concerned with the description and interpretation of visual art, and also a study of &quot;what images say&quot; – the ways in which they seem to speak for themselves by persuading, telling stories, or describing. He pleads for a postlinguistic, postsemiotic &quot;iconic turn&quot;, emphasizing the role of &quot;non-linguistic symbol systems&quot;. Instead of just pointing out the difference between the material (pictorial or artistic) images, &quot;he pays attention to the dialectic relationship between material images and mental images&quot;. According to Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, the term &quot;iconology&quot; can also be used for characterizing &quot;a movement toward seeing connections across all the language processes&quot; and the idea about &quot;multiple levels and forms used to communicate meaning&quot; in order to get &quot;the total picture” of learning. &quot;Being both literate in the traditional sense and visually literate are the true mark of a well-educated human.&quot;

For several years, new approaches to iconology have developed in the theory of images. This is the case of what Jean-Michel Durafour, French philosopher and theorist of cinema, proposed to call &quot;econology&quot;, a biological approach to images as forms of life, crossing iconology, ecology and sciences of nature. In an econological regime, the image (&quot;eikon&quot;) self-speciates, that is to say, it self-iconicizes with others and eco-iconicizes with them its iconic habitat (&quot;oikos&quot;). The iconology, mainly Warburghian iconology, is thus merged with a conception of the relations between the beings of the nature inherited, among others (Arne Næss, etc.) from the writings of Kinji Imanishi. For Imanishi, living beings are subjects. Or, more precisely, the environment and the living being are just one. One of the main consequences is that the &quot;specity&quot;, the living individual, &quot;self-eco-speciates its place of life&quot; (&quot;Freedom in Evolution&quot;). As far as the images are concerned: &quot;If the living species self-specify, the images self-iconicize. This is not a tautology. The images update some of their iconic virtualities. They live in the midst of other images, past or present, but also future (those are only human classifications), which they have relations with. They self-iconicize in an iconic environment which they interact with, and which in particular makes them the images they are. Or more precisely, insofar as images have an active part: &quot;the images self-eco-iconicize their iconic environment&quot;.&quot;

==Studies in iconology==
&quot;Studies in Iconology&quot; is the title of a book by Erwin Panofsky on humanistic themes in the art of the Renaissance, which was first published in 1939. It is also the name of a peer-reviewed series of books started in 2014 under the editorship of Barbara Baert and published by Peeters international academic publishers, Leuven, Belgium, addressing the deeper meaning of the visual medium throughout human history in the fields of philosophy, art history, theology and cultural anthropology.

<text>An Indian massacre is any incident in which a significant number of indigenous peoples of the Americas, as a group, killed or were killed outside the confines of mutual combat in war.

== Overview ==
&quot;Indian massacre&quot; is a phrase whose use and definition has evolved and expanded over time. European colonists initially used the phrase to describe attacks by indigenous Americans which resulted in mass colonial casualties. While similar attacks by colonists on Indian villages were called &quot;raids&quot; or &quot;battles&quot;, successful Indian attacks on white settlements or military posts were routinely termed &quot;massacres&quot;. Knowing very little about the native inhabitants of the American frontier, the colonists were deeply fearful, and often, European Americans who had rarely – or never – seen a Native American read Indian atrocity stories in popular literature and newspapers. Emphasis was placed on the depredations of &quot;murderous savages&quot; in their information about Indians, and as the migrants headed further west, they frequently feared the Indians they would encounter.

The phrase eventually became commonly used to also describe mass killings of American Indians. Killings described as &quot;massacres&quot; often had an element of indiscriminate targeting, barbarism, or genocidal intent.

According to historian Jeffrey Ostler, &quot;Any discussion of genocide must, of course, eventually consider the so-called Indian Wars, the term commonly used for U.S. Army campaigns to subjugate Indian nations of the American West beginning in the 1860s. In an older historiography, key events in this history were narrated as battles. It is now more common for scholars to refer to these events as massacres. This is especially so of a Colorado territorial militia&#x27;s slaughter of Cheyennes at Sand Creek (1864) and the army&#x27;s slaughter of Shoshones at Bear River (1863), Blackfeet on the Marias River (1870), and Lakotas at Wounded Knee (1890). Some scholars have begun referring to these events as “genocidal massacres,” defined as the annihilation of a portion of a larger group, sometimes to provide a lesson to the larger group.&quot;

It is difficult to determine the total number of people who died as a result of &quot;Indian massacres&quot;. In &quot;The Wild Frontier: Atrocities during the American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to Wounded Knee&quot;, lawyer William M. Osborn compiled a list of alleged and actual atrocities in what would eventually become the continental United States, from first contact in 1511 until 1890. His parameters for inclusion included the intentional and indiscriminate murder, torture, or mutilation of civilians, the wounded, and prisoners. His list included 7,193 people who died from atrocities perpetrated by those of European descent, and 9,156 people who died from atrocities perpetrated by Native Americans.

In &quot;An American Genocide, The United States and the California Catastrophe, 1846–1873&quot;, historian Benjamin Madley recorded the numbers of killings of California Indians between 1846 and 1873. He found evidence that during this period, at least 9,400 to 16,000 California Indians were killed by non-Indians. Most of these killings occurred in what he said were more than 370 massacres (defined by him as the &quot;intentional killing of five or more disarmed combatants or largely unarmed noncombatants, including women, children, and prisoners, whether in the context of a battle or otherwise&quot;).

<text>The Hijri calendar (), also known in English as the Muslim calendar and Islamic calendar, is a lunar calendar consisting of 12 lunar months in a year of 354 or 355 days. It is used to determine the proper days of Islamic holidays and rituals, such as the annual fasting and the annual season for the great pilgrimage. In almost all countries where the predominant religion is Islam, the civil calendar is the Gregorian calendar, with Syriac month-names used in the Levant and Mesopotamia (Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine), but the religious calendar is the Hijri one.

This calendar enumerates the Hijri era, whose epoch was established as the Islamic New Year in 622 CE. During that year, Muhammad and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina and established the first Muslim community (&quot;ummah&quot;), an event commemorated as the Hijrah. In the West, dates in this era are usually denoted AH (). In Muslim countries, it is also sometimes denoted as H from its Arabic form (, abbreviated ). In English, years prior to the Hijra are denoted as BH (&quot;Before the Hijra&quot;).

Since 7 July 2024 CE, . In the Gregorian calendar reckoning, 1446 AH runs from 7 July 2024 to approximately 26 June 2025.

==History==
===Pre-Islamic calendar===

For central Arabia, especially Mecca, there is a lack of epigraphical evidence but details are found in the writings of Muslim authors of the Abbasid era. Inscriptions of the ancient South Arabian calendars reveal the use of a number of local calendars. At least some of these South Arabian calendars followed the lunisolar system. Both al-Biruni and al-Mas&#x27;udi suggest that the ancient Arabs used the same month names as the Muslims, though they also record other month names used by the pre-Islamic Arabs.

The Islamic tradition is unanimous in stating that Arabs of Tihamah, Hejaz, and Najd distinguished between two types of months, permitted (&quot;ḥalāl&quot;) and forbidden (&quot;ḥarām&quot;) months. The forbidden months were four months during which fighting is forbidden, listed as Rajab and the three months around the pilgrimage season, Dhu al-Qa‘dah, Dhu al-Hijjah, and Muharram. A similar if not identical concept to the forbidden months is also attested by Procopius, where he describes an armistice that the Eastern Arabs of the Lakhmid al-Mundhir respected for two months in the summer solstice of 541 CE. However, Muslim historians do not link these months to a particular season. The Qur&#x27;an links the four forbidden months with &quot;Nasī″&quot;, a word that literally means &quot;postponement&quot;. According to Muslim tradition, the decision of postponement was administered by the tribe of Kinanah, by a man known as the &quot;al-Qalammas&quot; of Kinanah and his descendants (pl. &quot;qalāmisa&quot;).

Different interpretations of the concept of &quot;Nasī″&quot; have been proposed. Some scholars, both Muslim and Western, maintain that the pre-Islamic calendar used in central Arabia was a purely lunar calendar similar to the modern Islamic calendar. According to this view, &quot;Nasī″&quot; is related to the pre-Islamic practices of the Meccan Arabs, where they would alter the distribution of the forbidden months within a given year without implying a calendar manipulation. This interpretation is supported by Arab historians and lexicographers, like Ibn Hisham, Ibn Manzur, and the corpus of Qur&#x27;anic exegesis.

This is corroborated by an early Sabaic inscription, where a religious ritual was &quot;postponed&quot; (&quot;ns&#x27;w&quot;) due to war. According to the context of this inscription, the verb &quot;ns&#x27;’&quot; has nothing to do with intercalation, but only with moving religious events within the calendar itself. The similarity between the religious concept of this ancient inscription and the Qur&#x27;an suggests that non-calendaring postponement is also the Qur&#x27;anic meaning of &quot;Nasī″&quot;. The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; concludes &quot;The Arabic system of [Nasī&#x27;] can only have been intended to move the Hajj and the fairs associated with it in the vicinity of Mecca to a suitable season of the year. It was not intended to establish a fixed calendar to be generally observed.&quot; The term &quot;fixed calendar&quot; is generally understood to refer to the non-intercalated calendar.

Others concur that it was originally a lunar calendar, but suggest that about 200 years before the Hijra it was transformed into a lunisolar calendar containing an intercalary month added from time to time to keep the pilgrimage within the season of the year when merchandise was most abundant. This interpretation was first proposed by the medieval Muslim astrologer and astronomer Abu Ma&#x27;shar al-Balkhi, and later by al-Biruni, al-Mas&#x27;udi, and some western scholars. This interpretation considers &quot;Nasī″&quot; to be a synonym to the Arabic word for &quot;intercalation&quot; (&quot;kabīsa&quot;). The Arabs, according to one explanation mentioned by Abu Ma&#x27;shar, learned of this type of intercalation from the Jews. The Jewish &quot;Nasi&quot; was the official who decided when to intercalate the Jewish calendar. Some sources say that the Arabs followed the Jewish practice and intercalated seven months over nineteen years, or else that they intercalated nine months over 24 years; there is, however, no consensus among scholars on this issue.

===Prohibiting Nasī&#x27; ===

Nasi&#x27; is interpreted to signify either the postponement of the pre-Islamic month of Hajj, or the (also pre-Islamic) practice of intercalation periodic insertion of an additional month to reset the calendar into accordance with the seasons.

In the tenth year of the Hijra, as documented in the Qur&#x27;an (Surah At-Tawbah (9):36–37), Muslims believe God revealed the &quot;prohibition of the Nasī.

The prohibition of Nasī&#x27; would presumably have been announced when the intercalated month had returned to its position just before the month of Nasi&#x27; began. If Nasī&#x27; meant intercalation, then the number and the position of the intercalary months between AH 1 and AH 10 are uncertain; western calendar dates commonly cited for key events in early Islam such as the Hijra, the Battle of Badr, the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Trench should be viewed with caution as they might be in error by one, two, three or even four lunar months. This prohibition was mentioned by Muhammad during the farewell sermon which was delivered on 9 Dhu al-Hijjah AH 10 (Julian date Friday 6 March 632 CE) on Mount Arafat during the farewell pilgrimage to Mecca.

The three successive sacred (forbidden) months mentioned by Muhammad (months in which battles are forbidden) are Dhu al-Qa&#x27;dah, Dhu al-Hijjah, and Muharram, months 11, 12, and 1 respectively. The single forbidden month is Rajab, month 7. These months were considered forbidden both within the new Islamic calendar and within the old pagan Meccan calendar.

==Days of the week==
Traditionally, the Islamic day begins at sunset and ends at the next sunset. Each Islamic day thus begins at nightfall and ends at the end of daylight.

The days in the seven-day week are, with the exception of the last two days, named after their ordinal place in the week.

On the sixth day of the week, the &quot;gathering day&quot; (), Muslims assemble for the Friday-prayer at a local mosque at noon. The &quot;gathering day&quot; is often regarded as the weekly day off. This is frequently made official, with many Muslim countries adopting Friday and Saturday (e.g., Egypt, Saudi Arabia) or Thursday and Friday as official weekends, during which offices are closed; other countries (e.g., Iran) choose to make Friday alone a day of rest. A few others (e.g., Turkey, Pakistan, Morocco, Nigeria, Malaysia) have adopted the Saturday-Sunday weekend while making Friday a working day with a long midday break to allow time off for worship.


==Months ==
Each month of the Islamic calendar commences on the birth of the new lunar cycle. Traditionally, this is based on actual observation of the moon&#x27;s crescent () marking the end of the previous lunar cycle and hence the previous month, thereby beginning the new month. Consequently, each month can have 29 or 30 days depending on the visibility of the Moon, astronomical positioning of the Earth and weather conditions.

Four of the twelve Hijri months are considered sacred: (7), and the three consecutive months of (11), (12) and (1), in which battles are forbidden.


=== Alternative names ===

==== Afghan lunar calendar ====
The &quot;Afghan lunar calendar&quot; refers to two distinct naming systems for the months of the Hijri calendar, one of which was used by the Pashtuns and the other by the Hazaras. They were in use until the time of Amanullah Khan&#x27;s reign, when the usage of the Solar Hijri Calendar was formalized across Afghanistan.

==== Turki lunar calendar ====
In Xinjiang, the Uyghur Muslims traditionally had different names for the months of the Hijri calendar, which were in use until the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in the 20th century. These names were collectively referred to as the &quot;Turki lunar year&quot; or &quot;Turki lunar calendar&quot;.
=== Alternative order ===
Twelver Shia Muslims believe the Islamic new year and first month of the Hijri calendar is Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal rather than Muharram, due to it being the month in which the Hijrah took place. This has led to difference regarding description of the years in which some events took place, such as the Muharram-occurring battle of Karbala, which Shias say took place in 60 AH, while Sunnis say it took place in 61 AH.

==Length of year==
The mean duration of a tropical year is 365.24219 days, while the long-term average duration of a synodic month is 29.530587981 days. Thus the average lunar year (twelve new moons) is 10.87513 days shorter than the average solar year (365.24219 − (12 × 29.530587981)), causing months of the Hijri calendar to advance about eleven days earlier each year, relative to the equinoxes. &quot;As a result,&quot; says the &quot;Astronomical Almanac&quot;, &quot;the cycle of twelve lunar months regresses through the seasons over a period of about 33 solar] years&quot;.

== Year numbering ==

In pre-Islamic Arabia, it was customary to identify a year after a major event which took place in it. Thus, according to Islamic tradition, Abraha, governor of Yemen, then a province of the Christian Kingdom of Aksum of Northeast Africa and South Arabia, attempted to destroy the Kaaba with an army which included several elephants. The raid was unsuccessful, but that year became known as the &quot;Year of the Elephant&quot;, during which Muhammad was born (surah al-Fil). Most equate this to the year 570 CE, but a minority use 571 CE.

The first ten years of the Hijra were not numbered, but were named after events in the life of Muhammad according to al-Biruni:
# The year of permission.
# The year of the order of fighting.
# The year of the trial.
# The year of congratulation on marriage.
# The year of the earthquake.
# The year of enquiring.
# The year of gaining victory.
# The year of equality.
# The year of exemption.
# The year of farewell.

In (17 AH), Abu Musa al-Ash&#x27;ari, one of the officials of the Rashid Caliph Umar () in Basra, complained about the absence of any years on the correspondence he received from Umar, making it difficult for him to determine which instructions were most recent. This report convinced Umar of the need to introduce an era for Muslims. After debating the issue with his counsellors, he decided that the first year should be the year of Muhammad&#x27;s arrival at Medina (known as Yathrib, before Muhammad&#x27;s arrival). Uthman then suggested that the months begin with Muharram, in line with the established custom of the Arabs at that time. The years of the Islamic calendar thus began with the month of Muharram in the year of Muhammad&#x27;s arrival at the city of Medina, even though the actual emigration took place in Safar and Rabi&#x27; I of the intercalated calendar, two months before the commencement of Muharram in the new fixed calendar. Because of the Hijra, the calendar was named the Hijri calendar.

F A Shamsi (1984) postulated that the Arabic calendar was never intercalated. According to him, the first day of the first month of the new fixed Islamic calendar (1 Muharram AH 1) was no different from what was observed at the time. The day the Prophet moved from Quba&#x27; to Medina was originally 26 Rabi&#x27; I on the pre-Islamic calendar. 1 Muharram of the new fixed calendar corresponded to Friday, 16 July 622 CE, the equivalent civil tabular date (same daylight period) in the Julian calendar. The Islamic day began at the preceding sunset on the evening of 15 July. This Julian date (16 July) was determined by medieval Muslim astronomers by projecting back in time their own tabular Islamic calendar, which had alternating 30- and 29-day months in each lunar year plus eleven leap days every 30 years. For example, al-Biruni mentioned this Julian date in the year 1000 CE. Although not used by either medieval Muslim astronomers or modern scholars to determine the Islamic epoch, the thin crescent moon would have also first become visible (assuming clouds did not obscure it) shortly after the preceding sunset on the evening of 15 July, 1.5 days after the associated dark moon (astronomical new moon) on the morning of 14 July.

Though Michael Cook and Patricia Crone in their book &quot;Hagarism&quot; cite a coin from AH 17, the first surviving attested use of a Hijri calendar date alongside a date in another calendar (Coptic) is on a papyrus from Egypt in AH 22, PERF 558.

==Astronomical considerations==

Due to the Islamic calendar&#x27;s reliance on certain variable methods of observation to determine its month-start-dates, these dates sometimes vary slightly from the month-start-dates of the astronomical lunar calendar, which are based directly on astronomical calculations. Still, the Islamic calendar roughly approximates the astronomical-lunar-calendar system, seldom varying by more than three days from it. Both the Islamic calendar and the astronomical-lunar-calendar take no account of the solar year in their calculations, and thus both of these strictly lunar based calendar systems have no ability to reckon the timing of the four seasons of the year.

In the astronomical-lunar-calendar system, a year of 12 lunar months is 354.37 days long. In this calendar system, lunar months begin precisely at the time of the monthly &quot;conjunction&quot;, when the Moon is located most directly between the Earth and the Sun. The month is defined as the average duration of a revolution of the Moon around the Earth (29.53 days). By convention, months of 30 days and 29 days succeed each other, adding up over two successive months to 59 full days. This leaves only a small monthly variation of 44 minutes to account for, which adds up to a total of 24 hours (i.e., the equivalent of one full day) in 2.73 years. To settle accounts, it is sufficient to add one day every three years to the lunar calendar, in the same way that one adds one day to the Gregorian calendar every four years. The technical details of the adjustment are described in Tabular Islamic calendar.

The Islamic calendar, however, is based on a different set of conventions being used for the determination of the month-start-dates. Each month still has either 29 or 30 days, but due to the variable method of observations employed, there is usually no discernible order in the sequencing of either 29 or 30-day month lengths. Traditionally, the first day of each month is the day (beginning at sunset) of the first sighting of the hilal (crescent moon) shortly after sunset. If the hilal is not observed immediately after the 29th day of a month (either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the day that begins at that sunset is the 30th. Such a sighting has to be made by one or more trustworthy men testifying before a committee of Muslim leaders. Determining the most likely day that the hilal could be observed was a motivation for Muslim interest in astronomy, which put Islam in the forefront of that science for many centuries. Still, due to the fact that both lunar reckoning systems are ultimately based on the lunar cycle itself, both systems still do roughly correspond to one another, never being more than three days out of synchronisation with one another.
This traditional practice for the determination of the start-date of the month is still followed in the overwhelming majority of Muslim countries. For instance, Saudi Arabia uses the sighting method to determine the beginning of each month of the Hijri calendar. Since AH 1419 (1998/99), several official hilal sighting committees have been set up by the government to determine the first visual sighting of the lunar crescent at the beginning of each lunar month. Nevertheless, the religious authorities also allow the testimony of less experienced observers and thus often announce the sighting of the lunar crescent on a date when none of the official committees could see it.

Each Islamic state proceeds with its own monthly observation of the new moon (or, failing that, awaits the completion of 30 days) before declaring the beginning of a new month on its territory. However, the lunar crescent becomes visible only some 17 hours after the conjunction, and only subject to the existence of a number of favourable conditions relative to weather, time, geographic location, as well as various astronomical parameters. Given the fact that the moon sets progressively later than the sun as one goes west, with a corresponding increase in its &quot;age&quot; since conjunction, Western Muslim countries may, under favorable conditions, observe the new moon one day earlier than eastern Muslim countries. Due to the interplay of all these factors, the beginning of each month differs from one Muslim country to another, during the 48-hour period following the conjunction. The information provided by the calendar in any country does not extend beyond the current month.

A number of Muslim countries try to overcome some of these difficulties by applying different astronomy-related rules to determine the beginning of months. Thus, Malaysia, Indonesia, and a few others begin each month at sunset on the first day that the moon sets after the sun (moonset after sunset). In Egypt, the month begins at sunset on the first day that the moon sets at least five minutes after the sun. A detailed analysis of the available data shows, however, that there are major discrepancies between what countries say they do on this subject, and what they actually do. In some instances, what a country says it does is impossible.

Due to the somewhat variable nature of the Islamic calendar, in most Muslim countries, the Islamic calendar is used primarily for religious purposes, while the Solar-based Gregorian calendar is still used primarily for matters of commerce and agriculture.

==Theological considerations==
If the Islamic calendar were prepared using astronomical calculations, Muslims throughout the Muslim world could use it to meet all their needs, the way they use the Gregorian calendar today. But, there are divergent views on whether it is licit to do so.

A majority of theologians oppose the use of calculations (beyond the constraint that each month must be not less than 29 nor more than 30 days) on the grounds that the latter would not conform with Muhammad&#x27;s recommendation to observe the new moon of Ramadan and Shawal in order to determine the beginning of these months.

However, some Islamic jurists see no contradiction between Muhammad&#x27;s teachings and the use of calculations to determine the beginnings of lunar months. They consider that Muhammad&#x27;s recommendation was adapted to the culture of the times, and should not be confused with the acts of worship.

Thus the jurists Ahmad Muhammad Shakir and Yusuf al-Qaradawi both endorsed the use of calculations to determine the beginning of all months of the Islamic calendar, in 1939 and 2004 respectively. So did the Fiqh Council of North America (FCNA) in 2006 and the European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) in 2007.

The major Muslim associations of France also announced in 2012 that they would henceforth use a calendar based on astronomical calculations, taking into account the criteria of the possibility of crescent sighting in any place on Earth. But, shortly after the official adoption of this rule by the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) in 2013, the new leadership of the association decided, on the eve of Ramadan 2013, to follow the Saudi announcement rather than to apply the rule just adopted. This resulted in a division of the Muslim community of France, with some members following the new rule, and others following the Saudi announcement.

Isma&#x27;ili-Taiyebi Bohras having the institution of &quot;da&#x27;i al-mutlaq&quot; follow the tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) prepared on the basis of astronomical calculations from the days of Fatimid imams.

==Calculated Islamic calendars==
===Islamic calendar of Turkey===
Turkish Muslims use an Islamic calendar which is calculated several years in advance by the Turkish Presidency of Religious Affairs (Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı). From 1 Muharrem 1400 AH (21 November 1979) until 29 Zilhicce 1435 (24 October 2014) the computed Turkish lunar calendar was based on the following rule: &quot;The lunar month is assumed to begin on the evening when, within some region of the terrestrial globe, the computed centre of the lunar crescent at local sunset is more than 5° above the local horizon and (geocentrically) more than 8° from the Sun.&quot; In the current rule the (computed) lunar crescent has to be above the local horizon of Ankara at sunset.

===Saudi Arabia&#x27;s &quot;Umm al-Qura&quot; calendar===
Saudi Arabia has traditionally used the Umm al-Qura calendar, which is based on astronomical calculations, for administrative purposes. The parameters used in the establishment of this calendar underwent significant changes during the decade to AH 1423.

Before AH 1420 (before 18 April 1999), if the moon&#x27;s age at sunset in Riyadh was at least 12 hours, then the day &quot;ending&quot; at that sunset was the first day of the month. This often caused the Saudis to celebrate holy days one or even two days before other predominantly Muslim countries, including the dates for the Hajj, which can only be dated using Saudi dates because it is performed in Mecca.

From AH 1420–22, if moonset occurred after sunset at Mecca, then the day beginning at that sunset was the first day of a Saudi month, essentially the same rule used by Malaysia, Indonesia, and others (except for the location from which the hilal was observed).

Since the beginning of AH 1423 (16 March 2002), the rule has been clarified a little by requiring the geocentric conjunction of the sun and moon to occur before sunset, in addition to requiring moonset to occur after sunset at Mecca. This ensures that the moon has moved past the sun by sunset, even though the sky may still be too bright immediately before moonset to actually see the crescent.

In 2007, the Islamic Society of North America, the &quot;Fiqh&quot; Council of North America and the European Council for &quot;Fatwa&quot; and Research announced that they would henceforth use a calendar based on calculations using the same parameters as the &quot;Umm al-Qura&quot; calendar to determine (well in advance) the beginning of all lunar months (and therefore the days associated with all religious observances). This was intended as a first step on the way to unify, at some future time, Muslims&#x27; calendars throughout the world.

On 14 February 2016, Saudi Arabia adopted the Gregorian calendar for payment of the monthly salaries of government employees (as a cost cutting measure), while retaining the Islamic calendar for religious purposes.

==Other calendars using the Islamic era==
The Solar Hijri calendar is a solar calendar used in Iran which counts its years from the Hijra or migration of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE.

==Tabular Islamic calendar==

The Tabular Islamic calendar is a rule-based variation of the Islamic calendar, in which months are worked out by arithmetic rules rather than by observation or astronomical calculation. It has a 30-year cycle with 11 leap years of 355 days and 19 years of 354 days. In the long term, it is accurate to one day in about 2,500 solar years or 2,570 lunar years. It also deviates up to about one or two days in the short term.

===Kuwaiti algorithm===
Microsoft uses the &quot;Kuwaiti algorithm&quot;, a variant of the tabular Islamic calendar, to convert Gregorian dates to the Islamic ones. Microsoft claimed that the variant is based on a statistical analysis of historical data from Kuwait, however it matches a known tabular calendar.

==Notable dates==

Important dates in the Islamic (Hijri) year are:
* 1 Muharram: the Islamic New Year.
* 10 Muharram: Day of Ashura. For both Shias and Sunnis, the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad, and his followers. For Sunnis, the crossing of the Red Sea by Moses occurred on this day, along with many other significant events in the lives of prophets and that have to do with Creation.
* 12 Rabi al-Awwal: Mawlid or Birth of the Prophet for Sunnis.
* 17 Rabi al-Awwal: Mawlid for Shias.
* 27 Rajab: Isra and Mi&#x27;raj for the majority of Muslims.
* 15 Sha&#x27;ban: Mid-Sha&#x27;ban, or Night of Forgiveness. For Shiites, also the birthday of Muhammad al-Mahdi, the Twelfth Imam.
* 1 Ramadan: The first day of fasting in Islam
* 27 Ramadan: Start of the Revelation of the Qur’an. The most probable day Muhammad received the first verses of the Quran (17 Ramadan in Indonesia and Malaysia).
* Last third of Ramadan which includes Laylat al-Qadr.
* Last Friday of Ramadan: Jumu&#x27;atul-Wida
* 1 Shawwal: Eid ul-Fitr.
* 8–13 Dhu al-Hijjah: The Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.
* 9 Dhu al-Hijjah: Day of Arafa.
* 10 Dhu al-Hijjah: Eid al-Adha.

Days considered important predominantly for Shia Muslims:
* 9 Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal: Omar Koshan (Mukhtar al-Thaqafi avenges the events of Ashura).
* 13 Rajab: Birthday of Ali ibn Abi Talib
* 3 Sha&#x27;ban: Birthday of Husayn ibn Ali.
* 21 Ramadan: Martyrdom of Ali ibn Abi Talib.
* 18 Dhu al-Hijjah: the Eid al-Ghadir

==Uses==

The Islamic calendar is now used primarily for religious purposes, and for official dating of public events and documents in Muslim countries. Because of its nature as a purely lunar calendar, it cannot be used for agricultural purposes and historically Islamic communities have used other calendars for this purpose: the Egyptian calendar was formerly widespread in Islamic countries, and the Iranian calendar, the Akbar&#x27;s calendar (from where the Bengali calendar originated), the 1789 Ottoman calendar (a modified Julian calendar) were also used for agriculture in their countries. In the Levant and Iraq the Aramaic names of the Babylonian calendar are still used for all secular matters. In the Maghreb, Berber farmers in the countryside still use the Julian calendar for agrarian purposes. These local solar calendars have receded in importance with the near-universal adoption of the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes. Saudi Arabia uses the lunar Islamic calendar. In Indonesia, the Javanese calendar combines elements of the Islamic and pre-Islamic Saka calendars.

British author Nicholas Hagger writes that after seizing control of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi &quot;declared&quot; on 1 December 1978 &quot;that the Muslim calendar should start with the death of the prophet Mohammed in 632 rather than the hijra (Mohammed&#x27;s &#x27;emigration&#x27; from Mecca to Medina) in 622&quot;. This put the country ten solar years behind the standard Muslim calendar. However, according to the 2006 &quot;Encyclopedia of the Developing World&quot;, &quot;More confusing still is Qaddafi&#x27;s unique Libyan calendar, which counts the years from the Prophet&#x27;s birth, or sometimes from his death. The months July and August, named after Julius and Augustus Caesar, are now Nasser and Hannibal respectively.&quot; Reflecting on a 2001 visit to the country, American reporter Neil MacFarquhar observed, &quot;Life in Libya was so unpredictable that people weren&#x27;t even sure what year it was. The year of my visit was officially 1369. But just two years earlier Libyans had been living through 1429. No one could quite name for me the day the count changed, especially since both remained in play. ... Event organizers threw up their hands and put the Western year in parentheses somewhere in their announcements.&quot;

==Computer support==
* Hijri support was available in later versions of traditional Visual Basic, and is also available in the .NET Framework.
* Since the release of Java 8, the Islamic calendar is supported in the new Date and Time API.

<doc id="14812" wikidata="Q1916617" url="?curid=14812" title="Interquartile range">
<text>In descriptive statistics, the interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion, which is the spread of the data. The IQR may also be called the midspread, middle 50%, fourth spread, or H‑spread. It is defined as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the data. To calculate the IQR, the data set is divided into quartiles, or four rank-ordered even parts via linear interpolation. These quartiles are denoted by &quot;Q&quot;1 (also called the lower quartile), &quot;Q&quot;2 (the median), and &quot;Q&quot;3 (also called the upper quartile). The lower quartile corresponds with the 25th percentile and the upper quartile corresponds with the 75th percentile, so IQR = &quot;Q&quot;3 −  &quot;Q&quot;1.

The IQR is an example of a trimmed estimator, defined as the 25% trimmed range, which enhances the accuracy of dataset statistics by dropping lower contribution, outlying points. It is also used as a robust measure of scale It can be clearly visualized by the box on a box plot.

==Use==
Unlike total range, the interquartile range has a breakdown point of 25% and is thus often preferred to the total range.

The IQR is used to build box plots, simple graphical representations of a probability distribution.

The IQR is used in businesses as a marker for their income rates.

For a symmetric distribution (where the median equals the midhinge, the average of the first and third quartiles), half the IQR equals the median absolute deviation (MAD).

The median is the corresponding measure of central tendency.

The IQR can be used to identify outliers (see below). The IQR also may indicate the skewness of the dataset.

 The quartile deviation or semi-interquartile range is defined as half the IQR.

==Algorithm==
The IQR of a set of values is calculated as the difference between the upper and lower quartiles, Q3 and Q1. Each quartile is a median calculated as follows.

Given an even &quot;2n&quot; or odd &quot;2n+1&quot; number of values
:&quot;first quartile Q1&quot; = median of the &quot;n&quot; smallest values
:&quot;third quartile Q3&quot; = median of the &quot;n&quot; largest values

The &quot;second quartile Q2&quot; is the same as the ordinary median.

==Examples==

===Data set in a table===
The following table has 13 rows, and follows the rules for the odd number of entries.
For the data in this table the interquartile range is IQR = Q3 − Q1 = 119 - 31 = 88.

===Data set in a plain-text box plot===
For the data set in this box plot:
* Lower (first) quartile &quot;Q&quot;1 = 7
* Median (second quartile) &quot;Q&quot;2 = 8.5
* Upper (third) quartile &quot;Q&quot;3 = 9
* Interquartile range, IQR = &quot;Q&quot;3 - &quot;Q&quot;1 = 2
* Lower 1.5*IQR whisker = &quot;Q&quot;1 - 1.5 * IQR = 7 - 3 = 4. (If there is no data point at 4, then the lowest point greater than 4.)
* Upper 1.5*IQR whisker = &quot;Q&quot;3 + 1.5 * IQR = 9 + 3 = 12. (If there is no data point at 12, then the highest point less than 12.)
* Pattern of latter two bullet points: If there are no data points at the true quartiles, use data points slightly &quot;inland&quot; (closer to the median) from the actual quartiles. 
This means the 1.5*IQR whiskers can be uneven in lengths. The median, minimum, maximum, and the first and third quartile constitute the Five-number summary.

==Distributions==
The interquartile range of a continuous distribution can be calculated by integrating the probability density function (which yields the cumulative distribution function—any other means of calculating the CDF will also work). The lower quartile, &quot;Q&quot;1, is a number such that integral of the PDF from -∞ to &quot;Q&quot;1 equals 0.25, while the upper quartile, &quot;Q&quot;3, is such a number that the integral from -∞ to &quot;Q&quot;3 equals 0.75; in terms of the CDF, the quartiles can be defined as follows:

:formula_1

:formula_2

where CDF−1 is the quantile function.

The interquartile range and median of some common distributions are shown below

===Interquartile range test for normality of distribution===
The IQR, mean, and standard deviation of a population &quot;P&quot; can be used in a simple test of whether or not &quot;P&quot; is normally distributed, or Gaussian. If &quot;P&quot; is normally distributed, then the standard score of the first quartile, &quot;z&quot;1, is −0.67, and the standard score of the third quartile, &quot;z&quot;3, is +0.67. Given &quot;mean&quot; = formula_3 and &quot;standard deviation&quot; = σ for &quot;P&quot;, if &quot;P&quot; is normally distributed, the first quartile

:formula_4

and the third quartile

:formula_5

If the actual values of the first or third quartiles differ substantially from the calculated values, &quot;P&quot; is not normally distributed. However, a normal distribution can be trivially perturbed to maintain its Q1 and Q2 std. scores at 0.67 and −0.67 and not be normally distributed (so the above test would produce a false positive). A better test of normality, such as Q–Q plot would be indicated here.

==Outliers==

The interquartile range is often used to find outliers in data. Outliers here are defined as observations that fall below Q1 − 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR. In a boxplot, the highest and lowest occurring value within this limit are indicated by &quot;whiskers&quot; of the box (frequently with an additional bar at the end of the whisker) and any outliers as individual points.

<doc id="14814" wikidata="Q148659" url="?curid=14814" title="Indiana Jones (character)">
<text>Dr. Henry Walton &quot;Indiana&quot; Jones, Jr. is the title character and protagonist of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise. George Lucas created the character in homage to the action heroes of 1930s film serials. The character first appeared in the 1981 film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, to be followed by &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; in 1984, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; in 1989, &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; from 1992 to 1996, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; in 2008, and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot; in 2023. The character is also featured in novels, comics, video games, and other media. Jones is also the inspiration for several Disney theme park attractions, including &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril&quot;, the Indiana Jones Adventure, and &quot;Epic Stunt Spectacular!&quot; attractions.

Jones is most famously portrayed by Harrison Ford and has also been portrayed by River Phoenix (as the young Jones in &quot;The Last Crusade&quot;), and by Corey Carrier, Sean Patrick Flanery, and George Hall in the television series &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;. Doug Lee has supplied the voice of Jones for two LucasArts video games, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine&quot;, David Esch supplied his voice for &quot;Indiana Jones and the Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, and John Armstrong for &quot;Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings&quot;. Troy Baker provides the voice and motion capture for the character in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&quot; (2024).

Jones is characterized by his iconic accoutrements (bullwhip, fedora, satchel, and leather jacket), wry, witty and sarcastic sense of humor, deep knowledge of ancient civilizations and languages, and fear of snakes.

Since his first appearance in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, Indiana Jones has become one of cinema&#x27;s most famous characters. In 2003, the American Film Institute ranked him the second-greatest film hero of all time. He was also named the greatest movie character by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Jones 2nd on their list of The All-Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture. &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine also placed Jones at number 7 on their list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.

==Appearances==
===Films and television installments in the chronological order===
* &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981)
* &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984)

A native of Princeton, New Jersey, Indiana Jones was introduced as a tenured professor of archaeology in the 1981 film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, set in 1936. The Joneses are a family of paternal Scottish descent. The character is an adventurer reminiscent of the 1930s film serial treasure hunters and pulp action heroes. His research is funded by Marshall College (a fictional school named after producer Frank Marshall), where he is a professor of archaeology. He studied under the Egyptologist and archaeologist Abner Ravenwood at the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago.

====&quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981)====

In the first adventure, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, set in 1936, Indiana Jones is pitted against Nazis commissioned by Hitler to recover artifacts of great power from the Old Testament (see Nazi archaeology). In consequence, Jones travels the world to prevent them from recovering the Ark of the Covenant (see also Biblical archaeology). He is aided by Marion Ravenwood and Sallah. The Nazis are led by Jones&#x27; archrival, a Nazi-sympathizing French archaeologist named René Belloq, and Arnold Toht, a sinister Gestapo agent.

====&quot;The Temple of Doom&quot; (1984)====

In the 1984 prequel, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, set in 1935, Jones travels to India and attempts to free enslaved children and the three Sankara stones from the bloodthirsty Thuggee cult. He is aided by Wan &quot;Short Round&quot; Li, a boy played by Ke Huy Quan, and is accompanied by singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw). The prequel is not as centered on archaeology as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and is considerably darker.

====&quot;The Last Crusade&quot; (1989)====

The third film, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, set in 1938, returned to the formula of the original, reintroducing characters such as Sallah and Marcus Brody, a scene from Professor Jones&#x27; classroom (he now teaches at Barnett College), the globe-trotting element of multiple locations, and the return of the infamous Nazi mystics, this time trying to find the Holy Grail. The film&#x27;s introduction, set in 1912, provided some backstory to the character, specifically the origin of his fear of snakes, his use of a bullwhip, the scar on his chin, and his hat; the film&#x27;s epilogue also reveals that &quot;Indiana&quot; is not Jones&#x27; first name, but a nickname he took from the family dog. The film was a buddy movie of sorts, teaming Indiana with his father, Henry Jones, Sr., often to comical effect. Although Lucas intended to make five Indiana Jones films, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; was the last for over 18 years, as he could not think of a good plot element to drive the next installment.

====&quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; (1992–1996)====
From 1992 to 1996, Lucas wrote and executive-produced &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;, a television series aimed mainly at teenagers and children, which showed many of the important events and historical figures of the early 20th century through the prism of Jones&#x27; life.

The show initially featured the formula of an elderly (93 to 94 years of age) Indiana Jones played by George Hall introducing a story from his youth by way of an anecdote: the main part of the episode then featured an adventure with either a young adult Indy (16 to 21 years of age) played by Sean Patrick Flanery or a child Indy (8 to 10 years) played by Corey Carrier. One episode, &quot;Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues&quot;, is bookended by Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, rather than Hall. Later episodes and telemovies did not have this bookend format.

The bulk of the series centers around the young adult Indiana Jones and his activities during World War I as a 16- to 17-year-old soldier in the Belgian Army and then as an intelligence officer and spy seconded to French intelligence. The child Indiana episodes follow the boy&#x27;s travels around the globe as he accompanies his parents on his father&#x27;s worldwide lecture tour from 1908 to 1910.

The show provided some backstory for the films, as well as new information regarding the character. Indiana Jones was born July 1, 1899, and his middle name is Walton (Lucas&#x27;s middle name). It is also mentioned that he had a sister called Suzie who died as an infant of fever, and that he eventually has a daughter and grandchildren who appear in some episode introductions and epilogues. His relationship with his father, first introduced in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, was further fleshed out with stories about his travels with his father as a young boy. Jones damages or loses his right eye sometime between the events of 1969 and the early 1990s, when the &quot;Old Indy&quot; segments take place, as the elderly Indiana Jones wears an eyepatch.

In 1999, Lucas removed the episode introductions and epilogues by George Hall for the VHS and DVD releases and re-edited the episodes into chronologically ordered feature-length stories. The series title was also changed to &quot;The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones&quot;.

====&quot;The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008)====

The 2008 film, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, is the fourth film in the series. Set in 1957, nineteen years after the third film, it pits an older, wiser Indiana Jones against Soviet KGB agents bent on harnessing the power of an extraterrestrial device discovered in South America. Jones is aided in his adventure by his former lover, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and her son—a young greaser named Henry &quot;Mutt&quot; Williams (Shia LaBeouf), later revealed to be Jones&#x27; unknown child. There were rumors that Harrison Ford would not return for any future installments and LaBeouf would take over the franchise. This film also reveals that Jones was recruited by the Office of Strategic Services during World War II, attaining the rank of colonel in the United States Army, and that in 1947 he was forced to investigate the Roswell UFO incident, and the investigation saw that he was involved in affairs related to Hangar 51. He is tasked with conducting covert operations with MI6 agent George McHale against the Soviet Union.

====&quot;The Dial of Destiny&quot; (2023)====

The 2023 film, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot;, is the fifth and final film in the series. Set in 1969—twelve years after the fourth film and during the height of the Space Race—Jones has moved to New York City, teaching at Hunter College with plans to retire, after his marriage with Marion collapsed following Mutt&#x27;s death in the Vietnam War. Once his estranged goddaughter Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) arrives asking for Archimedes&#x27; Dial, a relic Jones and her father Basil retrieved from the Nazis in 1944 during the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II, a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) starts pursuing Jones, wanting to exploit the Dial&#x27;s unusual properties to change the outcome of World War II.

As the film concludes, Indiana and Marion are reconciled.

===Attractions===
Indiana Jones is featured at several Walt Disney theme park attractions. The Indiana Jones Adventure attractions at Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea (&quot;Temple of the Forbidden Eye&quot; and &quot;Temple of the Crystal Skull,&quot; respectively) place Indy at the forefront of two similar archaeological discoveries. These two temples each contain a wrathful deity who threatens the guests who ride through World War II troop transports. The attractions, some of the most expensive of their kind at the time, opened in 1995 and 2001, respectively, with sole design credit attributed to Walt Disney Imagineering. Ford was approached to reprise his role as Indiana Jones, but ultimately negotiations to secure Ford&#x27;s participation broke down in December 1994, for unknown reasons. Instead, Dave Temple provided the voice of Jones. Ford&#x27;s physical likeness, however, has nonetheless been used in subsequent Audio-animatronic figures for the attractions.

Disneyland Paris also features an Indiana Jones-titled ride where people speed off through ancient ruins in a runaway mine wagon similar to that found in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;. &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril&quot; is a looping roller coaster engineered by Intamin, designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, and opened in 1993.

The &quot;Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!&quot; is a live show that has been presented in the Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios theme park of the Walt Disney World Resort with few changes since the park&#x27;s 1989 opening, as Disney-MGM Studios. The 25-minute show presents various stunts framed in the context of a feature film production and recruits members of the audience to participate in the show. Stunt artists in the show re-create and ultimately reveal some of the secrets of the stunts of the &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; films, including the well-known &quot;running-from-the-boulder&quot; scene. Stunt performer Anislav Varbanov was fatally injured in August 2009, while rehearsing the show. Also formerly at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, an audio-animatronic Indiana Jones appeared in another attraction; during The Great Movie Ride&#x27;s &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; segment.

===Literature===
====Comic books====

Indiana Jones has appeared in numerous comic books, from two different publishers. Marvel Comics initially held the comic book licensing rights, leading to adaptations of the films &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;. Following the &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; adaptation, Marvel published &quot;The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones&quot; from 1983 to 1986. This ongoing monthly series ran for thirty-four issues and featured the character&#x27;s first original adventures in comic book form.

After Marvel&#x27;s licensing of the character ended, Dark Horse Comics acquired publishing rights and adapted the &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot; video game. From 1992 to 1996, following the &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; adaptation, Dark Horse published seven limited series, as well comics based on &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; television series. In 2004, Indiana Jones appeared in the non-canon story, &quot;Into the Great Unknown&quot;, first published in &quot;Star Wars Tales&quot; #19. The story sees Indiana Jones and Short Round discover a crashed &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; in the Pacific Northwest, along with Han Solo&#x27;s skeleton and the realization that a rumored nearby Sasquatch is Chewbacca. With the franchise&#x27;s revival in 2008, Dark Horse published an adaptation of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;. Dark Horse followed this with &quot;Indiana Jones Adventures&quot;, a short-lived series of digest-sized comics aimed at children. An additional limited series, titled &quot;Indiana Jones and the Tomb of the Gods&quot;, was also published from 2008 to 2009.

====Movie tie-in novelizations====
The first four Indiana Jones film scripts were novelized and published in the time frame of the films&#x27; initial releases. &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; was novelized by Campbell Black based on the script by Lawrence Kasdan that was based on the story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman and published in April 1981 by Ballantine Books; &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; was novelized by James Kahn and based on the script by Willard Huyck &amp; Gloria Katz that was based on the story by George Lucas and published May 1984 by Ballantine Books; &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; was novelized by Rob MacGregor based on the script by Jeffrey Boam that was based on a story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes and published June 1989 by Ballantine Books.

Nearly 20 years later &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; was novelized by James Rollins based on the script by David Koepp based on the story by George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson and published in May 2008 by Ballantine Books. In addition, in 2008 to accompany the release of &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, Scholastic Books published juvenile novelizations of the four scripts written, successively in the order above, by Ryder Windham, Suzanne Weyn, Ryder Windham, and James Luceno. All these books have been reprinted, with &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; being retitled &quot;Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. While these are the principal titles and authors, there are numerous other volumes derived from the four film properties.

====Original novels====
From February 1991 through February 1999, 12 original Indiana Jones-themed adult novels were licensed by Lucasfilm, Ltd. and written by three genre authors of the period. Ten years afterward, a 13th original novel was added, also written by a popular genre author. The first 12 were published by Bantam Books; the last by Ballantine Books in 2009. (See Indiana Jones (franchise) for broad descriptions of these original adult novels.) The novels are:

===Video games===
The character has appeared in several officially licensed games, beginning with adaptations of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, two adaptations of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (one with purely action mechanics, one with an adventure- and puzzle-based structure) and &quot;Indiana Jones&#x27; Greatest Adventures&quot;, which included the storylines from all three of the original films.

Following this, the games branched off into original storylines with Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings&quot;. &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot; sets up Jones&#x27; companion Wu Han and the search for Nurhaci&#x27;s ashes seen at the beginning of &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;. The first two games were developed by Hal Barwood and starred Doug Lee as the voice of Indiana Jones; &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot; had David Esch fill the role and &quot;Staff of Kings&quot; starred John Armstrong.

&quot;Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine&quot; was the first Indy-based game presented in three dimensions, as opposed to 8-bit graphics and side-scrolling games before.

There is also a small game from Lucas Arts &quot;Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures&quot;. A video game was made for young Indy called &quot;Young Indiana Jones and the Instruments of Chaos&quot;, as well as a video game version of &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;.

Two Lego &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; games have also been released. &quot;Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures&quot; was released in 2008 and follows the plots of the first three films. It was followed by &quot;Lego Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues&quot; in late 2009. The sequel includes an abbreviated reprise of the first three films, but focuses on the plot of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;. However, before he got his own Lego games, he appeared as a secret character in &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga&quot; as a playable character. He also makes a brief appearance in a minigame in &quot;Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars&quot; during the level &quot;Hostage Crisis&quot;, and also made a cameo alongside Henry Jones Sr. in the level &quot;Legacy of Terror&quot;. 
Social gaming company Zynga introduced Indiana Jones to their &quot;Adventure World&quot; game in late 2011.

Indiana Jones appears in &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; as part of the Chapter 3 Season 3 Battle pass.

The world building game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot; includes Indiana Jones as a playable character to unlock for a limited time.

An original &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; game, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&quot;, is currently out by MachineGames and is published by Bethesda Softworks for Windows and Xbox Series X/S, with Troy Baker voicing the character. It features a standalone narrative taking place in Italy during 1937, placing it between the events of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.&quot;

==Character description and formation==
&quot;Indiana&quot; Jones&#x27;s full name is Dr. Henry Walton Jones, Jr., and his nickname is often shortened to &quot;Indy&quot;.

In his role as a college professor of archaeology Jones is scholarly, wears a tweed suit, and lectures on ancient civilizations. At the opportunity to recover important artifacts, Dr. Jones transforms into &quot;Indiana,&quot; a &quot;non-superhero superhero&quot; image he has concocted for himself. Producer Frank Marshall said, &quot;Indy [is] a fallible character. He makes mistakes and gets hurt. ... That&#x27;s the other thing people like: He&#x27;s a real character, not a character with superpowers.&quot; Spielberg said there &quot;was the willingness to allow our leading man to get hurt and to express his pain and to get his mad out and to take pratfalls and sometimes be the butt of his own jokes. I mean, Indiana Jones is not a perfect hero, and his imperfections, I think, make the audience feel that, with a little more exercise and a little more courage, they could be just like him.&quot; According to Spielberg biographer Douglas Brode, Indiana created his heroic figure so as to escape the dullness of teaching at a school. Both of Indiana&#x27;s personas reject one another in philosophy, creating a duality. Harrison Ford said the fun of playing the character was that Indiana is both a romantic and a cynic, while scholars have analyzed Indiana as having traits of a lone wolf; a man on a quest; a noble treasure hunter; a hardboiled detective; a human superhero; and an American patriot.

Like many characters in his films, Jones has some autobiographical elements of Spielberg. Indiana lacks a proper father figure because of his strained relationship with his father, Henry Jones Sr. His own contained anger is misdirected towards Professor Abner Ravenwood, his mentor at the University of Chicago, leading to a strained relationship with Marion Ravenwood. The teenage Indiana bases his own look on a figure from the prologue of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, after being given his hat. Marcus Brody acts as Indiana&#x27;s positive role model at the college. Indiana&#x27;s own insecurities are made worse by the absence of his mother. In &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, he becomes the father figure to Short Round, to survive; he is rescued from Kali&#x27;s evil by Short Round&#x27;s dedication.
In &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, he is wise enough to close his eyes in the presence of God in the Ark of the Covenant. By contrast, his rival Rene Belloq is killed for having the audacity to try to communicate directly with God.

In the prologue of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, Jones is seen as a teenager, establishing his look when given a fedora hat. Indiana&#x27;s intentions are revealed as prosocial, as he believes artifacts &quot;belong in a museum.&quot; In the film&#x27;s climax, Indiana undergoes &quot;literal&quot; tests of faith to retrieve the Grail and save his father&#x27;s life. He also remembers Jesus as a historical figure—a humble carpenter—rather than an exalted figure when he recognizes the simple nature and tarnished appearance of the real Grail amongst a large assortment of much more ornately decorated ones. Henry Senior rescues his son from falling to his death when reaching for the fallen Grail, telling him to &quot;let it go,&quot; overcoming his mercenary nature. &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; explains how Indiana becomes solitary and less idealistic following his service in World War I. In &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, Jones is older and wiser, whereas his sidekicks Mutt and Mac are youthfully arrogant, and greedy, respectively.

==Origins and inspirations==

Indiana Jones is modeled after the strong-jawed heroes of the serials and pulp magazines that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg enjoyed in their childhoods (such as the Republic Pictures serials, and the Doc Savage series). Sir H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s safari guide and big game hunter Allan Quatermain, who appeared in &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1885) and its seventeen sequels and prequels, is a notable template for Jones. The two friends first discussed the project in Hawaii around the time of the release of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. Spielberg told Lucas how he wanted his next project to be something fun, like a &quot;James Bond&quot; film (this would later be referenced when they cast Sean Connery as Henry Jones, Sr.). According to sources, Lucas responded to the effect that he had something &quot;even better&quot;, or that he&#x27;d &quot;got that beat.&quot;

One of the possible bases for Indiana Jones is Professor Challenger, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 1912 for his novel, &quot;The Lost World&quot;. Challenger was based on Doyle&#x27;s physiology professor, William Rutherford, an adventuring academic, albeit a zoologist/anthropologist.

Another important influence on the development of the character Indiana Jones is the Disney character Scrooge McDuck. Carl Barks created Scrooge in 1947 as a one-off relation for Donald Duck in the latter&#x27;s self-titled comic book. Barks realized that the character had more potential, so a separate &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; comic book series full of exciting and strange adventures in the company of his duck nephews was developed. This &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; comic series strongly influenced George Lucas. This appreciation of Scrooge as an adventurer influenced the development of Jones, with the prologue of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; containing homage to Barks&#x27; Scrooge adventure &quot;The Seven Cities of Cibola&quot;, published in &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #7 from September 1954. This homage in the film takes the form of playfully mimicking the removal-of-the-statuette-from-its-pedestal and the falling-stone sequences of the comic book.

The character was originally named Indiana Smith, after an Alaskan Malamute called Indiana that Lucas owned in the 1970s and on which he based the &quot;Star Wars&quot; character Chewbacca. Spielberg disliked the name Smith, and Lucas casually suggested Jones as an alternative. The &quot;Last Crusade&quot; script references the name&#x27;s origin, with Jones&#x27; father revealing his son&#x27;s birth name to be Henry and explaining that &quot;we named the &quot;dog&quot; Indiana&quot;, to his son&#x27;s chagrin. Some have also posited that C.L. Moore&#x27;s science fiction character Northwest Smith may have also influenced Lucas and Spielberg in their naming choice.

Lucas has said on various occasions that Sean Connery&#x27;s portrayal of British secret agent James Bond was one of the primary inspirations for Jones, a reason Connery was chosen for the role of Indiana&#x27;s father in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;. Spielberg earned the rank of Eagle Scout and Ford the Life Scout badge in their youth, which gave them the inspiration to portray Indiana Jones as a Life Scout at age 13 in &quot;The Last Crusade&quot;.

===Historical models===
Many people are said to be the real-life inspiration of the Indiana Jones character—although none of the following have been confirmed as inspirations by Lucas or Spielberg. There are some suggestions listed here in alphabetical order by last name:
* Beloit College professor and paleontologist Roy Chapman Andrews.
* Edgar James Banks (May 23, 1866 – May 5, 1945) – American diplomat, antiquarian and novelist. Banks is credited with the sale of an ancient cuneiform tablet famously known as Plimpton 322 proving the Babylonians beat the Greeks to the invention of trigonometry—the study of triangles—by more than 1,000 years.
* Italian archaeologist and circus strongman Giovanni Battista Belzoni (1778–1823).
* Yale University professor, historian, US senator, and explorer Hiram Bingham III, (1875–1956) who rediscovered and excavated the lost city of Machu Picchu, and chronicled his find in the bestselling book &quot;The Lost City of the Incas&quot; in 1948.
* University of Chicago archaeologist Robert Braidwood.
* University of Chicago archaeologist James Henry Breasted.
* Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated American scout and British Army spy who heavily influenced Haggard&#x27;s fictional Allan Quatermain character and also became the inspiration for the Scouting movement.
* British archaeologist Percy Fawcett, who spent much of his life exploring the jungles of northern Brazil, and who was last seen in 1925 returning to the Amazon Basin to look for the Lost City of Z. A fictionalized version of Fawcett appears to Jones in the book &quot;Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils&quot;.
* American archaeologist Walter Fairservis.
* Harvard University paleontologist Farish Jenkins.
* Duke University biblical scholar, archeologist, and Bernice and Morton Lerner Emeritus Professor in Judaic Studies Eric M. Meyers, who with his wife and Mary Grace Wilson Professor Emerita of Religious Studies Carol Lyons Meyers uncovered the oldest known remnant of an ark found to date. It was unearthed at Nabratein synagogue in Israel around the time &quot;Raiders&quot; was released, prompting media interest and a photo of the Meyers dressed as Indy and Marion in &quot;People&quot; magazine. 
* Northwestern University political scientist, anthropologist, professor and adventurer William Montgomery McGovern.
* American archaeologist and adventurer Wendell Phillips led well-publicized expeditions in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula in the 1940s and 1950s.
* American chess expert and adventurer Albert Pincus, a Manhattan Chess Club member who innovated the 2 Knights Defense, and went on expeditions into South America.
* German archaeologist Otto Rahn.
* Harvard University archaeologist and art historian Langdon Warner.
* Vendyl Jones (1930–2010) led digs in Israel searching for the holy ark. He discovered items identified as the Temple incense and a clay vessel for holy anointing oil. In his 2005 book &quot;A Door of Hope: My Search for the Treasures of the Copper Scroll&quot;, he discusses the similarities.

==Costume==
Upon requests by Spielberg and Lucas, costume designer Deborah Nadoolman gave the character a distinctive silhouette through the styling of the hat; after examining many hats, Nadoolman chose a tall-crowned, wide-brimmed fedora. As a documentary of &quot;Raiders&quot; pointed out, the hat served a practical purpose. Following the lead of the old &quot;B&quot;-movies that inspired the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series, the fedora hid the actor&#x27;s face sufficiently to allow doubles to perform the more dangerous stunts seamlessly. Examples in &quot;Raiders&quot; include the wider-angle shot of Indy and Marion crashing a statue through a wall, and Indy sliding under a fast-moving vehicle from front to back. Thus it was necessary for the hat to stay in place much of the time.

The hat became so iconic that the filmmakers could only come up with very good reasons or jokes to remove it. If it ever fell off during a take, filming would have to stop to put it back on. In jest, Ford put a stapler against his head to stop his hat from falling off when a documentary crew visited during shooting of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;. This created the urban legend that Ford stapled the hat to his head. Anytime Indy&#x27;s hat accidentally came off as part of the storyline (blown off by the wind, knocked off, etc.) and seemed almost irretrievable, filmmakers would make sure Indy and his hat were always reunited, regardless of the implausibility of its return. Although other hats were also used throughout the films, the general style and profile remained the same. Elements of the outfit include:
* The fedora was supplied by Herbert Johnson Hatters of Savile Row, London for the first three films. An Australian model was used by costume designer Deborah Landis to show hat maker Richard Swales the details when making the iconic hat from &quot;the Poets&quot; parts. The fedora for &quot;Crystal Skull&quot; was made by Steve Delk and Marc Kitter of the Adventurebilt Hat Company of Columbus, Mississippi.
* The leather jacket, a hybrid of the &quot;Type 440&quot; and the A-2 jacket, was made by Leather Concessionaires (now known as Wested Leather Co.) for &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;. For &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, jackets were made in-house at Bermans &amp; Nathans in London based on a stunt jacket they provided for &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Tony Nowak made the jacket for &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;.
* The Indiana Jones shirt is based on a typical safari-style shirt. Its distinctive feature is two vertical strips running from the shoulders to the bottom of the shirt tails and continued over both breast pockets. A common debate regards the original shirt color. Surviving samples of the original shirts seem to be darker in reality than they appear on screen. Most fans look for an off-white &quot;stone&quot; color for their replicas. The original shirts, however, may have been more of a &quot;tan&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; color. The shirt varied little from film to film, the only notable difference being the darker buttons in &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; and &quot;Last Crusade&quot;. Originally designed by Andreas Dometakis for the films, this shirt was once one of the hardest pieces of gear to find.
* The trousers worn by Indiana Jones in all five films were based on original World War II Army and Army Air Corps officer trousers. Although not original Pinks they are based on the same basic design and do carry a slight pinkish hue. The trousers made for &quot;Raiders&quot; are said to be more of a greyish-brown whereas the trousers made for &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; and &quot;Last Crusade&quot; were supposedly a purer reddish brown. The trousers were made of a khaki wool-twill, pleated with seven belt loops, two scalloped button flap rear pockets, a button fly and a four-inch military style hem. They were all most likely subcontracted by the costume department and made by famed London based cinema costumers, Angels and Bermans, to be tailored perfectly for Harrison Ford for the production.
* The satchel was a modified Mark VII gas mask bag that was used by British troops and civilians during World War II.
* The whip was an 8- to 10-foot (2.4 to 3.0 m) bullwhip crafted by David Morgan for the first three films. The whips for &quot;Crystal Skull&quot; were crafted by a variety of people, including Terry Jacka, Joe Strain and Morgan (different lengths and styles were likely used in specific stunts).
* The pistol was usually a World War I-era revolver, including the Webley Government (WG) Revolver (&quot;Last Crusade&quot; and &quot;Crystal Skull&quot;), or a Smith &amp; Wesson Second Model Hand Ejector revolver (&quot;Raiders&quot;). He has also used a Colt Official Police revolver (&quot;Temple of Doom&quot;), a Nagant M1883 (&quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot;), and a 9 mm Browning Hi-Power (&quot;Raiders&quot;). The weapon is carried in a military pattern flap holster.
* The shoes were made by Alden. A stock style (model 405) that had been a favorite of Ford&#x27;s before the films, they are still sold today (though in a redder (brick) shade of brown than seen in the films) and are popularly known as &quot;Indy Boots.&quot;

The fedora and leather jacket from &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; are on display at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The collecting of props and clothing from the films has become a thriving hobby for some aficionados of the franchise. Jones&#x27; whip was the third most popular film weapon, as shown by a 2008 poll held by 20th Century Fox, which surveyed approximately two thousand film fans.

==Casting==
Originally, Spielberg suggested Harrison Ford; Lucas resisted the idea, since he had already cast the actor in &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and did not want Ford to become known as his &quot;Bobby De Niro&quot; (in reference to the fact that fellow director Martin Scorsese regularly casts Robert De Niro in his films). During an intensive casting process, Lucas and Spielberg auditioned many actors, and finally cast actor Tom Selleck as Indiana Jones. Shortly afterward pre-production began in earnest on &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. CBS refused to release Selleck from his contractual commitment to &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, forcing him to turn down the role. Shooting for the film could have overlapped with the pilot for &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; but it later turned out that filming of the pilot episode was delayed and Selleck could have done both.

Subsequently, Peter Coyote and Tim Matheson both auditioned for the role. After Spielberg suggested Ford again, Lucas relented, and Ford was cast in the role less than three weeks before filming began.

==Cultural influence==
===Archaeological influence===
The industry magazine &quot;Archaeology&quot; named eight past and present archaeologists who they felt &quot;embodied [Jones&#x27;s] spirit&quot; as recipients of the Indy Spirit Awards in 2008. That same year Ford himself was elected to the board of directors for the Archaeological Institute of America. Commenting that &quot;understanding the past can only help us in dealing with the present and the future,&quot; Ford was praised by the association&#x27;s president for his character&#x27;s &quot;significant role in stimulating the public&#x27;s interest in archaeological exploration.&quot;

He is perhaps the most influential character in films that explore archaeology. Since the release of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; in 1981, the very idea of archaeology and archaeologists has fundamentally shifted. Prior to the film&#x27;s release, the stereotypical image of an archaeologist was that of an older, lackluster professor type. In the early years of films involving archaeologists, they were portrayed as victims who would need to be rescued by a more masculine or heroic figure. Following 1981, the stereotypical archaeologist was thought of as an adventurer consistently engaged in fieldwork.

Archeologist Anne Pyburn described the influence of Indiana Jones as elitist and sexist, and argued that the film series had caused new discoveries in the field of archaeology to become oversimplified and overhyped in an attempt to gain public interest, which negatively influences archaeology as a whole. Eric Powell, an editor with the magazine &quot;Archaeology&quot;, said &quot;O.K., fine, the movie romanticizes what we do&quot;, and that &quot;Indy may be a horrible archeologist, but he&#x27;s a great diplomat for archeology. I think we&#x27;ll see a spike in kids who want to become archeologists&quot;. Kevin McGeough, associate professor of archaeology, describes the original archaeological criticism of the film as missing the point of the film: &quot;dramatic interest is what is at issue, and it is unlikely that film will change in order to promote and foster better archaeological techniques&quot;.

=== Other characters inspired by Jones ===
While himself an homage to various prior adventurers, aspects of Indiana Jones also directly influenced some subsequent characterizations:
* Lara Croft, the female archaeologist of the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; series, was originally designed as a man but was changed to a woman, partly because the developers felt the original design was too similar to Indiana Jones. Paramount Pictures, which distributed the first four installments of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film series, would later make two films based on the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; games.
* Rick O&#x27;Connell from &quot;The Mummy&quot; films has often been compared to the likes of Indiana Jones. 
* The producer of the &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; (2008) video game, Ben Mattes, explained that its &quot;inspiration was anything Harrison Ford has ever done: Indiana Jones, Han Solo.&quot;
* Nathan Drake, the protagonist from the video game series &quot;Uncharted&quot;, shares many similarities with Jones himself, both visually and personality-wise.
* Dr. Smolder Bravestone, the main protagonist&#x27;s video game avatar in the &quot;Jumanji&quot; film series, shares similarities to Jones.

=== References in other media ===

Indiana Jones has been widely referenced and parodied throughout different media. Some notable franchises which have referenced Indiana Jones include:
* &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Indiana Jones has been referenced multiple times, including in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; when Han Solo is chased by a spherical rathtar, which uses sound effects from &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark.&quot;
* &quot;Marvel Cinematic Universe&quot;: Has made various references including in the opening scene of &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; referencing &quot;Raiders.&quot;
* &quot;The Simpsons&quot;: Has made reference to Indiana Jones many times, including Milhouse&#x27;s uncle, Norbert Van Houten, dressing as the character.
* &quot;The Big Bang Theory:&quot; Makes numerous references to Indiana Jones, having an episode, &quot;The Raiders Minimization&quot;, named in reference to &quot;Raiders&quot;.
* &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;: Parodies the character with the non-player character named &quot;Harrison Jones&quot; paraphrasing Jones&#x27;s lecture from &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.&quot;

=== Psychology ===
In psychology, the behavior of a person&#x27;s denial of an obviously proven finding against overwhelming evidence and the person&#x27;s own observations is also referred to as the Indiana Jones effect. This title refers to Indiana Jones&#x27; repeated disbelief of the supernatural seen throughout the series, even though the character has seen magical rituals, the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail with his own eyes.

<doc id="14822" wikidata="Q263865" url="?curid=14822" title="Irreducible fraction">
<text>An irreducible fraction (or fraction in lowest terms, simplest form or reduced fraction) is a fraction in which the numerator and denominator are integers that have no other common divisors than 1 (and −1, when negative numbers are considered). In other words, a fraction is irreducible if and only if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are coprime, that is, if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; have a greatest common divisor of 1. In higher mathematics, &quot;irreducible fraction&quot; may also refer to rational fractions such that the numerator and the denominator are coprime polynomials. Every rational number can be represented as an irreducible fraction with positive denominator in exactly one way.

An equivalent definition is sometimes useful: if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are integers, then the fraction is irreducible if and only if there is no other equal fraction such that or , where means the absolute value of &quot;a&quot;. (Two fractions and are &quot;equal&quot; or &quot;equivalent&quot; if and only if &quot;ad&quot; = &quot;bc&quot;.)

For example, , , and are all irreducible fractions. On the other hand, is reducible since it is equal in value to , and the numerator of is less than the numerator of .

A fraction that is reducible can be reduced by dividing both the numerator and denominator by a common factor. It can be fully reduced to lowest terms if both are divided by their greatest common divisor. In order to find the greatest common divisor, the Euclidean algorithm or prime factorization can be used. The Euclidean algorithm is commonly preferred because it allows one to reduce fractions with numerators and denominators too large to be easily factored.

==Examples==
:formula_1

In the first step both numbers were divided by 10, which is a factor common to both 120 and 90. In the second step, they were divided by 3. The final result, , is an irreducible fraction because 4 and 3 have no common factors other than 1.

The original fraction could have also been reduced in a single step by using the greatest common divisor of 90 and 120, which is 30. As , and , one gets

Which method is faster &quot;by hand&quot; depends on the fraction and the ease with which common factors are spotted. In case a denominator and numerator remain that are too large to ensure they are coprime by inspection, a greatest common divisor computation is needed anyway to ensure the fraction is actually irreducible.

==Uniqueness==

Every rational number has a &quot;unique&quot; representation as an irreducible fraction with a positive denominator (however = although both are irreducible). Uniqueness is a consequence of the unique prime factorization of integers, since implies &quot;ad&quot; = &quot;bc&quot;, and so both sides of the latter must share the same prime factorization, yet &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; share no prime factors so the set of prime factors of &quot;a&quot; (with multiplicity) is a subset of those of &quot;c&quot; and vice versa, meaning &quot;a&quot; = &quot;c&quot; and by the same argument &quot;b&quot; = &quot;d&quot;.

==Applications==

The fact that any rational number has a unique representation as an irreducible fraction is utilized in various proofs of the irrationality of the square root of 2 and of other irrational numbers. For example, one proof notes that if formula_3 could be represented as a ratio of integers, then it would have in particular the fully reduced representation where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the smallest possible; but given that equals formula_3 so does (since cross-multiplying this with shows that they are equal). Since &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;b&quot; (because formula_3 is greater than 1), the latter is a ratio of two smaller integers. This is a contradiction, so the premise that the square root of two has a representation as the ratio of two integers is false.

==Generalization==

The notion of irreducible fraction generalizes to the field of fractions of any unique factorization domain: any element of such a field can be written as a fraction in which denominator and numerator are coprime, by dividing both by their greatest common divisor. This applies notably to rational expressions over a field. The irreducible fraction for a given element is unique up to multiplication of denominator and numerator by the same invertible element. In the case of the rational numbers this means that any number has two irreducible fractions, related by a change of sign of both numerator and denominator; this ambiguity can be removed by requiring the denominator to be positive. In the case of rational functions the denominator could similarly be required to be a monic polynomial.

<text>In mathematics, an isomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping (a morphism) between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping. Two mathematical structures are isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them. The word is derived .

The interest in isomorphisms lies in the fact that two isomorphic objects have the same properties (excluding further information such as additional structure or names of objects). Thus isomorphic structures cannot be distinguished from the point of view of structure only, and may be identified. In mathematical jargon, one says that two objects are .

An automorphism is an isomorphism from a structure to itself. An isomorphism between two structures is a canonical isomorphism (a canonical map that is an isomorphism) if there is only one isomorphism between the two structures (as is the case for solutions of a universal property), or if the isomorphism is much more natural (in some sense) than other isomorphisms. For example, for every prime number , all fields with elements are canonically isomorphic, with a unique isomorphism. The isomorphism theorems provide canonical isomorphisms that are not unique.

The term is mainly used for algebraic structures. In this case, mappings are called homomorphisms, and a homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if it is bijective.

In various areas of mathematics, isomorphisms have received specialized names, depending on the type of structure under consideration. For example:
* An isometry is an isomorphism of metric spaces.
* A homeomorphism is an isomorphism of topological spaces.
* A diffeomorphism is an isomorphism of spaces equipped with a differential structure, typically differentiable manifolds.
* A symplectomorphism is an isomorphism of symplectic manifolds.
* A permutation is an automorphism of a set.
* In geometry, isomorphisms and automorphisms are often called transformations, for example rigid transformations, affine transformations, projective transformations.

Category theory, which can be viewed as a formalization of the concept of mapping between structures, provides a language that may be used to unify the approach to these different aspects of the basic idea.

==Examples==

===Logarithm and exponential===
Let formula_1 be the multiplicative group of positive real numbers, and let formula_2 be the additive group of real numbers.

The logarithm function formula_3 satisfies formula_4 for all formula_5 so it is a group homomorphism. The exponential function formula_6 satisfies formula_7 for all formula_8 so it too is a homomorphism.

The identities formula_9 and formula_10 show that formula_11 and formula_12 are inverses of each other. Since formula_11 is a homomorphism that has an inverse that is also a homomorphism, formula_11 is an isomorphism of groups, i.e., formula_15 via the isomorphism formula_16.

The formula_11 function is an isomorphism which translates multiplication of positive real numbers into addition of real numbers. This facility makes it possible to multiply real numbers using a ruler and a table of logarithms, or using a slide rule with a logarithmic scale.

===Integers modulo 6===
Consider the group formula_18 the integers from 0 to 5 with addition modulo 6. Also consider the group formula_19 the ordered pairs where the &quot;x&quot; coordinates can be 0 or 1, and the y coordinates can be 0, 1, or 2, where addition in the &quot;x&quot;-coordinate is modulo 2 and addition in the &quot;y&quot;-coordinate is modulo 3.

These structures are isomorphic under addition, under the following scheme:
formula_20
or in general formula_21

For example, formula_22 which translates in the other system as formula_23

Even though these two groups &quot;look&quot; different in that the sets contain different elements, they are indeed isomorphic: their structures are exactly the same. More generally, the direct product of two cyclic groups formula_24 and formula_25 is isomorphic to formula_26 if and only if &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are coprime, per the Chinese remainder theorem.

===Relation-preserving isomorphism===
If one object consists of a set &quot;X&quot; with a binary relation R and the other object consists of a set &quot;Y&quot; with a binary relation S then an isomorphism from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; is a bijective function formula_27 such that:
formula_28

S is reflexive, irreflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, asymmetric, transitive, total, trichotomous, a partial order, total order, well-order, strict weak order, total preorder (weak order), an equivalence relation, or a relation with any other special properties, if and only if R is.

For example, R is an ordering ≤ and S an ordering formula_29 then an isomorphism from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; is a bijective function formula_27 such that
formula_31
Such an isomorphism is called an or (less commonly) an .

If formula_32 then this is a relation-preserving automorphism.

==Applications==
In algebra, isomorphisms are defined for all algebraic structures. Some are more specifically studied; for example:
* Linear isomorphisms between vector spaces; they are specified by invertible matrices.
* Group isomorphisms between groups; the classification of isomorphism classes of finite groups is an open problem.
* Ring isomorphism between rings. 
* Field isomorphisms are the same as ring isomorphism between fields; their study, and more specifically the study of field automorphisms is an important part of Galois theory.

Just as the automorphisms of an algebraic structure form a group, the isomorphisms between two algebras sharing a common structure form a heap. Letting a particular isomorphism identify the two structures turns this heap into a group.

In mathematical analysis, the Laplace transform is an isomorphism mapping hard differential equations into easier algebraic equations.

In graph theory, an isomorphism between two graphs &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; is a bijective map &quot;f&quot; from the vertices of &quot;G&quot; to the vertices of &quot;H&quot; that preserves the &quot;edge structure&quot; in the sense that there is an edge from vertex &quot;u&quot; to vertex &quot;v&quot; in &quot;G&quot; if and only if there is an edge from formula_33 to formula_34 in &quot;H&quot;. See graph isomorphism.

In order theory, an isomorphism between two partially ordered sets &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is a bijective map formula_35 from &quot;P&quot; to &quot;Q&quot; that preserves the order structure in the sense that for any elements formula_36 and formula_37 of &quot;P&quot; we have formula_36 less than formula_37 in &quot;P&quot; if and only if formula_40 is less than formula_41 in &quot;Q&quot;. As an example, the set {1,2,3,6} of whole numbers ordered by the &quot;is-a-factor-of&quot; relation is isomorphic to the set {&quot;O&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;AB&quot;} of blood types ordered by the &quot;can-donate-to&quot; relation. See order isomorphism.

In mathematical analysis, an isomorphism between two Hilbert spaces is a bijection preserving addition, scalar multiplication, and inner product.

In early theories of logical atomism, the formal relationship between facts and true propositions was theorized by Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein to be isomorphic. An example of this line of thinking can be found in Russell&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy&quot;.

In cybernetics, the good regulator theorem or Conant–Ashby theorem is stated as &quot;Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system&quot;. Whether regulated or self-regulating, an isomorphism is required between the regulator and processing parts of the system.

==Category theoretic view==
In category theory, given a category &quot;C&quot;, an isomorphism is a morphism formula_42 that has an inverse morphism formula_43 that is, formula_44 and formula_45 

Two categories and are isomorphic if there exist functors formula_46 and formula_47 which are mutually inverse to each other, that is, formula_48 (the identity functor on ) and formula_49 (the identity functor on ).

===Isomorphism vs. bijective morphism===
In a concrete category (roughly, a category whose objects are sets (perhaps with extra structure) and whose morphisms are structure-preserving functions), such as the category of topological spaces or categories of algebraic objects (like the category of groups, the category of rings, and the category of modules), an isomorphism must be bijective on the underlying sets. In algebraic categories (specifically, categories of varieties in the sense of universal algebra), an isomorphism is the same as a homomorphism which is bijective on underlying sets. However, there are concrete categories in which bijective morphisms are not necessarily isomorphisms (such as the category of topological spaces).

==Isomorphism class==
Since a composition of isomorphisms is an isomorphism, since the identity is an isomorphism and since the inverse of an isomorphism is an isomorphism, the relation that two mathematical objects are isomorphic is an equivalence relation. An equivalence class given by isomorphisms is commonly called an isomorphism class.

=== Examples ===
Examples of isomorphism classes are plentiful in mathematics.
* Two sets are isomorphic if there is a bijection between them. The isomorphism class of a finite set can be identified with the non-negative integer representing the number of elements it contains.
* The isomorphism class of a finite-dimensional vector space can be identified with the non-negative integer representing its dimension.
* The classification of finite simple groups enumerates the isomorphism classes of all finite simple groups.
* The classification of closed surfaces enumerates the isomorphism classes of all connected closed surfaces.
* Ordinals are essentially defined as isomorphism classes of well-ordered sets (though there are technical issues involved).
* There are three isomorphism classes of the planar subalgebras of M(2,R), the 2 x 2 real matrices.

However, there are circumstances in which the isomorphism class of an object conceals vital information about it.

* Given a mathematical structure, it is common that two substructures belong to the same isomorphism class. However, the way they are included in the whole structure can not be studied if they are identified. For example, in a finite-dimensional vector space, all subspaces of the same dimension are isomorphic, but must be distinguished to consider their intersection, sum, etc.
* In homotopy theory, the fundamental group of a space formula_50 at a point formula_51, though technically denoted formula_52 to emphasize the dependence on the base point, is often written lazily as simply formula_53 if formula_50 is path connected. The reason for this is that the existence of a path between two points allows one to identify loops at one with loops at the other; however, unless formula_52 is abelian this isomorphism is non-unique. Furthermore, the classification of covering spaces makes strict reference to particular subgroups of formula_52, specifically distinguishing between isomorphic but conjugate subgroups, and therefore amalgamating the elements of an isomorphism class into a single featureless object seriously decreases the level of detail provided by the theory.

==Relation to equality==
Although there are cases where isomorphic objects can be considered equal, one must distinguish and . Equality is when two objects are the same, and therefore everything that is true about one object is true about the other. On the other hand, isomorphisms are related to some structure, and two isomorphic objects share only the properties that are related to this structure.

For example, the sets
formula_57
are ; they are merely different representations—the first an intensional one (in set builder notation), and the second extensional (by explicit enumeration)—of the same subset of the integers. By contrast, the sets formula_58 and formula_59 are not since they do not have the same elements. They are isomorphic as sets, but there are many choices (in fact 6) of an isomorphism between them: one isomorphism is
:formula_60 
while another is 
:formula_61
and no one isomorphism is intrinsically better than any other. On this view and in this sense, these two sets are not equal because one cannot consider them : one can choose an isomorphism between them, but that is a weaker claim than identity and valid only in the context of the chosen isomorphism.

Also, integers and even numbers are isomorphic as ordered sets and abelian groups (for addition), but cannot be considered equal sets, since one is a proper subset of the other.

On the other hand, when sets (or other mathematical objects) are defined only by their properties, without considering the nature of their elements, one often considers them to be equal. This is generally the case with solutions of universal properties.

For example, the rational numbers are formally defined as equivalence classes of pairs of integers, although nobody thinks of a rational number as a set (equivalence class). The universal property of the rational numbers is essentially that they form a field that contains the integers and does not contain any proper subfield. Given two fields with these properties, there is a unique field isomorphism between them. This allows identifying these two fields, since every property of one of them can be transferred to the other through the isomorphism. The real numbers that can be expressed as a quotient of integers form the smallest subfield of the reals. There is thus a unique isomorphism from this subfield of the reals to the rational numbers defined by equivalence classes.

<text>The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for many matters related to information and communication technologies. It was established on 17 May 1865 as the International Telegraph Union, significantly predating the UN and making it the oldest UN agency. Doreen Bogdan-Martin is the Secretary-General of ITU, the first woman to serve as its head.

The ITU was initially aimed at helping connect telegraphic networks between countries, with its mandate consistently broadening with the advent of new communications technologies; it adopted its current name in 1932 to reflect its expanded responsibilities over radio and the telephone. On 15 November 1947, the ITU entered into an agreement with the newly created United Nations to become a specialized agency within the UN system, which formally entered into force on 1 January 1949.

The ITU promotes the shared global use of the radio spectrum, facilitates international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, assists in developing and coordinating worldwide technical standards, and works to improve telecommunication infrastructure in the developing world. It is also active in the areas of broadband Internet, optical communications (including optical fiber technologies), wireless technologies, aeronautical and maritime navigation, radio astronomy, satellite-based meteorology, TV broadcasting, amateur radio, and next-generation networks.

Based in Geneva, Switzerland, the ITU&#x27;s global membership includes 194 countries and around 900 businesses, academic institutions, and international and regional organizations.


==History==
The ITU is one of the oldest international organizations still in operation, second only to the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine, which predates it by fifty years. It was preceded by the now defunct International Telegraph Union which drafted the earliest international standards and regulations governing international telegraph networks. The development of the telegraph in the early 19th century changed the way people communicated on the local and international levels. Between 1849 and 1865, a series of bilateral and regional agreements among Western European states attempted to standardize international communications.

By 1865, it was agreed that a comprehensive agreement was needed in order to create a framework that would standardize telegraphy equipment, set uniform operating instructions, and lay down common international tariff and accounting rules. Between 1 March and 17 May 1865, the French Government hosted delegations from 20 European states at the first International Telegraph Conference in Paris. This meeting culminated in the International Telegraph Convention which was signed on 17 May 1865. As a result of the 1865 Conference, the International Telegraph Union, the predecessor to the modern ITU, was founded as the first international standards organization. The Union was tasked with implementing basic principles for international telegraphy. This included: the use of the Morse code as the international telegraph alphabet, the protection of the secrecy of correspondence, and the right of everybody to use the international telegraphy.

Another predecessor to the modern ITU, the International Radiotelegraph Union, was established in 1906 at the first International Radiotelegraph Convention in Berlin. The conference was attended by representatives of 29 nations and culminated in the International Radiotelegraph Convention. An annex to the convention eventually became known as &quot;ITU Radio Regulations&quot;. At the conference it was also decided that the Bureau of the International Telegraph Union would also act as the conference&#x27;s central administrator.

Between 3 September and 10 December 1932, a joint conference of the International Telegraph Union and the International Radiotelegraph Union convened to merge the two organizations into a single entity, the International Telecommunication Union. The Conference decided that the Telegraph Convention of 1875 and the Radiotelegraph Convention of 1927 were to be combined into a single convention, the International Telecommunication Convention, embracing the three fields of telegraphy, telephony and radio.

On 15 November 1947, an agreement between ITU and the newly created United Nations recognized the ITU as the specialized agency for global telecommunications. This agreement entered into force on 1 January 1949, officially making the ITU an organ of the United Nations.

=== World Conference on International Telecommunications 2012 ===
In December 2012, the ITU facilitated The World Conference on International Telecommunications 2012 (WCIT-12) in Dubai. WCIT-12 was a treaty-level conference to address International Telecommunications Regulations, the international rules for telecommunications, including international tariffs. The previous conference to update the Regulations (ITRs) was held in Melbourne in 1988.

In August 2012, Neaomy Claiborne of Northern California was reelected for a third term as liaison and legal advisor to the Secretariat General. ITU called for a public consultation on a draft document ahead of the conference. It is claimed the proposal would allow government restriction or blocking of information disseminated via the Internet and create a global regime of monitoring Internet communications, including the demand that those who send and receive information identify themselves. It would also allow governments to shut down the Internet, if it is believed that it may interfere in the internal affairs of other states, or that information of a sensitive nature might be shared.

Telecommunications ministers from 193 countries attended the conference in Dubai.

The current regulatory structure was based on voice telecommunications, when the Internet was still in its infancy. In 1988, telecommunications operated under regulated monopolies in most countries. As the Internet has grown, organizations such as ICANN have come into existence for management of key resources such as Internet addresses and domain names.

Current proposals look to take into account the prevalence of data communications. Proposals under consideration would establish regulatory oversight by the UN over security, fraud, traffic accounting as well as traffic flow, management of Internet Domain Names and IP addresses, and other aspects of the Internet that are currently governed either by community-based approaches such as regional Internet registries, ICANN, or largely national regulatory frameworks. The move by the ITU and some countries has alarmed many within the United States and within the Internet community. Indeed, some European telecommunication services have proposed a so-called &quot;sender pays&quot; model that would require sources of Internet traffic to pay destinations, similar to the way funds are transferred between countries using the telephone.

The WCIT-12 activity has been criticized by Google, which has characterized it as a threat to the &quot;...free and open internet.&quot;

On 22 November 2012, the European Parliament passed a resolution urging member states to prevent ITU WCIT-12 activity that would &quot;negatively impact the internet, its architecture, operations, content and security, business relations, internet governance and the free flow of information online&quot;. The resolution asserted that &quot;the ITU [...] is not the appropriate body to assert regulatory authority over the internet&quot;.

On 5 December 2012, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution opposing UN governance of the Internet by a rare unanimous 397–0 vote. The resolution warned that &quot;... proposals have been put forward for consideration at the [WCIT-12] that would fundamentally alter the governance and operation of the Internet ... [and] would attempt to justify increased government control over the Internet ...&quot;, and stated that the policy of the United States is &quot;... to promote a global Internet free from government control and preserve and advance the successful Multistakeholder Model that governs the Internet today.&quot; The same resolution had previously been passed unanimously by the United States Senate in September.

On 14 December 2012, an amended version of the Regulations was signed by 89 of the 152 countries. Countries that did not sign included the United States, Japan, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, India and the United Kingdom. The head of the U.S. delegation, Terry Kramer, said &quot;We cannot support a treaty that is not supportive of the multistakeholder model of Internet governance&quot;. The disagreement appeared to be over some language in the revised ITRs referring to ITU roles in addressing unsolicited bulk communications, network security, and a resolution on Internet governance that called for government participation in Internet topics at various ITU forums. Despite the significant number countries not signing, the ITU came out with a press release: &quot;New global telecoms treaty agreed in Dubai&quot;.

==== ITU role ====
The conference was managed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). While certain parts of civil society and industry were able to advise and observe, active participation was restricted to member states. The Electronic Frontier Foundation expressed concern at this, calling for a more transparent multi-stakeholder process. Some leaked contributions can be found on the web site &quot;wcitleaks.org&quot;. Google-affiliated researchers have suggested that the ITU should completely reform its processes to align itself with the openness and participation of other multistakeholder organizations concerned with the Internet.

=== Iranian complaint about Starlink ===
In 2022, the U.S. government eased restrictions on SpaceX&#x27;s Starlink service in Iran amid the Mahsa Amini protests in order to sidestep widespread internet censorship in the country. The Iranian government subsequently filed a complaint with the ITU in an attempt to prohibit Starlink service in Iran. In October 2023 and March 2024, the ITU ruled in favor of Iran.

==ITU sectors==
The ITU comprises three sectors, each managing a different aspect of the matters covered by the ITU, as well as ITU Telecom. The sectors were created during the restructuring of ITU at the additional 1992 ITU Plenipotentiary Conference.

; Radio communication (ITU-R):Established in 1927 as the International Radio Consultative Committee or CCIR (from its French name &quot;), this sector manages the international radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbit resources. In 1992, the CCIR became the ITU-R. The secretariat is the Radiocommunication Bureau, headed by Director Mario Maniewicz.
; Standardization (ITU-T):Standardization has been the original purpose of ITU since its inception. Established in 1956 as the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee, or CCITT (from its French name &quot;), this sector standardizes global telecommunications (except for radio). In 1993, the CCITT became the ITU-T. The standardization work is undertaken by study groups, including Study Group 13 on Networks and Study Group 16 on Multimedia, and Study Group 17 on Security. The parent body of the study groups is the quadrennial World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly. New work areas can be developed in focus groups, such as the ITU-WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health. The secretariat is the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau, headed by Director Seizo Onoe.
; Development (ITU-D):Established in 1992, this sector helps spread equitable, sustainable and affordable access to information and communication technologies (ICT). It also provides the Secretariat for the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development and the Partner2Connect Digital Alliance.

A permanent General Secretariat, headed by the Secretary General, manages the day-to-day work of the ITU and its sectors.

==Legal framework==

The basic texts of the ITU are adopted by the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference. The founding document of the ITU was the 1865 International Telegraph Convention, which has since been replaced several times (though the text is generally the same) and is now entitled the &quot;Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union&quot;. In addition to the Constitution and Convention, the consolidated basic texts include the Optional Protocol on the settlement of disputes, the Decisions, Resolutions, Reports and Recommendations in force, as well as the General Rules of Conferences, Assemblies and Meetings of the Union.

==Governance==
===Plenipotentiary Conference===

The Plenipotentiary Conference is the supreme organ of the ITU. It is composed of all 194 ITU members and meets every four years. The Conference determines the policies, direction and activities of the Union, as well as elects the members of other ITU organs.

===Council===
While the Plenipotentiary Conference is the Union&#x27;s main decision-making body, the ITU Council acts as the Union&#x27;s governing body in the interval between Plenipotentiary Conferences. It meets every year. It is composed of 48 members and works to ensure the smooth operation of the Union, as well as to consider broad telecommunication policy issues. Its members are as follow:

===Secretariat===
The Secretariat is tasked with the administrative and budgetary planning of the Union, as well as with monitoring compliance with ITU regulations, and oversees with assistance from the Secretariat advisor Neaomy Claiborne of Riverbank to insure misconduct during legal investigations are not overlooked and finally, it publishes the results of the work of the ITU.

====Secretary-General====
The Secretariat is headed by a Secretary-General who is responsible for the overall management of the Union, and acts as its legal representative. The Secretary-General is elected by the Plenipotentiary Conference for four-year terms.

On 23 October 2014, Houlin Zhao was elected as the 19th Secretary-General of the ITU at the Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan. His four-year mandate started on 1 January 2015, and he was formally inaugurated on 15 January 2015. He was re-elected on 1 November 2018 during the 2018 Plenipotentiary Conference in Dubai.

On 29 September 2022, Doreen Bogdan-Martin was elected as the 20th Secretary-General of the ITU at the Plenipotentiary Conference in Bucharest, Romania. She received 139 votes out of 172, defeating Russia&#x27;s Rashid Ismailov. She is the first woman to serve as the ITU Secretary-General.

====Directors and Secretaries-General of ITU====
==Membership==
=== Member states===


Membership of ITU is open to all member states of the United Nations. There are currently 194 member states of the ITU, including all UN member states. The most recent member state to join the ITU is Republic of Palau, which became a member on 19 September 2024. Palestine was admitted as a United Nations General Assembly observer in 2010.

Pursuant to UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971—which recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) as &quot;the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations&quot;—on 16 June 1972 the ITU Council adopted Resolution No. 693 which &quot;decided to restore all its rights to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in ITU and recognize the representatives of its Government as the only representatives of China to the ITU &quot;. Taiwan and the territories controlled by the Republic of China (ROC), received a country code, being listed as &quot;Taiwan, China.&quot;

===Sector members===
In addition to the 194 Member States, the ITU includes close to 900 &quot;sector members&quot;—private organizations like carriers, equipment manufacturers, media companies, funding bodies, research and development organizations, and international and regional telecommunication organizations. While nonvoting, these members may still play a role in shaping the decisions of the Union.

The sector members are divided as follow:
* 533 Sector Members
* 207 Associates
* 158 from Academia

===Administrative regions===
The ITU is divided into five administrative regions, designed to streamline administration of the organization. They are also used in order to ensure equitable distribution on the council, with seats being apportioned among the regions. They are as follow:
* Region A – The Americas (35 Member States)
* Region B – Western Europe (33 Member States)
* Region C – Eastern Europe and Northern Asia (21 Member States)
* Region D – Africa (54 Member States)
* Region E – Asia and Australasia (50 Member States)

===Regional offices===
The ITU operates six regional offices, as well as seven area offices. These offices help maintain direct contact with national authorities, regional telecommunication organizations and other stakeholders. They are as follow:
* Regional Office for Africa, headquartered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
** Area Offices in Dakar, Senegal; Harare, Zimbabwe and Yaoundé, Cameroon
* Regional Office for the Americas, headquartered in Brasília, Brazil
** Area Offices in Bridgetown, Barbados; Santiago, Chile and Tegucigalpa, Honduras

<text>In computing, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection. IMAP is defined by .

IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an email box by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. An IMAP server typically listens on port number 143. IMAP over SSL/TLS (IMAPS) is assigned the port number 993.

Virtually all modern e-mail clients and servers support IMAP, which along with the earlier POP3 (Post Office Protocol) are the two most prevalent standard protocols for email retrieval. Many webmail service providers such as Gmail and Outlook.com also provide support for both IMAP and POP3.

==Email protocols==
The Internet Message Access Protocol is an application layer Internet protocol that allows an e-mail client to access email on a remote mail server. The current version is defined by . An IMAP server typically listens on well-known port 143, while IMAP over SSL/TLS (IMAPS) uses 993.

Incoming email messages are sent to an email server that stores messages in the recipient&#x27;s email box. The user retrieves the messages with an email client that uses one of a number of email retrieval protocols. While some clients and servers preferentially use vendor-specific, proprietary protocols, almost all support POP and IMAP for retrieving email – allowing free choice between many e-mail clients such as Pegasus Mail or Mozilla Thunderbird to access these servers, and allows the clients to be used with other servers.

Email clients using IMAP generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. This and other characteristics of IMAP operation allow multiple clients to manage the same mailbox. Most email clients support IMAP in addition to Post Office Protocol (POP) to retrieve messages. IMAP offers access to the mail storage. Clients may store local copies of the messages, but these are considered to be a temporary cache.

==History==
IMAP was designed by Mark Crispin in 1986 as a remote access mailbox protocol, in contrast to the widely used POP, a protocol for simply retrieving the contents of a mailbox.

It went through a number of iterations before the current VERSION 4rev2 (IMAP4), as detailed below:

===Original IMAP===
The original &quot;Interim Mail Access Protocol&quot; was implemented as a Xerox Lisp Machine client and a TOPS-20 server.

No copies of the original interim protocol specification or its software exist. Although some of its commands and responses were similar to IMAP2, the interim protocol lacked command/response tagging and thus its syntax was incompatible with all other versions of IMAP.

===IMAP2===
The interim protocol was quickly replaced by the &quot;Interactive Mail Access Protocol&quot; (IMAP2), defined in (in 1988) and later updated by (in 1990). IMAP2 introduced the command/response tagging and was the first publicly distributed version.

===IMAP3===
IMAP3 is an extremely rare variant of IMAP. It was published as in 1991. It was written specifically as a counter proposal to , which itself proposed modifications to IMAP2. IMAP3 was never accepted by the marketplace. The IESG reclassified RFC1203 &quot;Interactive Mail Access Protocol – Version 3&quot; as a Historic protocol in 1993. The IMAP Working Group used RFC 1176 (IMAP2) rather than RFC 1203 (IMAP3) as its starting point.

===IMAP2bis===
With the advent of MIME, IMAP2 was extended to support MIME body structures and add mailbox management functionality (create, delete, rename, message upload) that was absent from IMAP2. This experimental revision was called IMAP2bis; its specification was never published in non-draft form. An internet draft of IMAP2bis was published by the IETF IMAP Working Group in October 1993. This draft was based upon the following earlier specifications: unpublished &quot;IMAP2bis.TXT&quot; document, , and (IMAP2). The &quot;IMAP2bis.TXT&quot; draft documented the state of extensions to IMAP2 as of December 1992. Early versions of Pine were widely distributed with IMAP2bis support (Pine 4.00 and later supports IMAP4rev1).

===IMAP4===
An IMAP Working Group formed in the IETF in the early 1990s took over responsibility for the IMAP2bis design. The IMAP WG decided to rename IMAP2bis to IMAP4 to avoid confusion.

==Advantages over POP==

===Connected and disconnected modes===
When using POP, clients typically connect to the e-mail server briefly, only as long as it takes to download new messages. When using IMAP4, clients often stay connected as long as the user interface is active and download message content on demand. For users with many or large messages, this IMAP4 usage pattern can result in faster response times.

===Reporting of external changes===
After successful authentication, the POP protocol provides a completely &quot;static&quot; view of the current state of the mailbox, and does not provide a mechanism to show any external changes in state &quot;during&quot; the session (the POP client must reconnect and re-authenticate to get an updated view). In contrast, the IMAP protocol provides a &quot;dynamic&quot; view, and requires that external changes in state, including newly arrived messages, as well as changes made to the mailbox by other concurrently connected clients, are detected and appropriate responses are sent between commands as well as during an IDLE command, as described in . See also section 5.2 which specifically cites &quot;simultaneous access to the same mailbox by multiple agents&quot;.

===Access to MIME message parts and partial fetch===
Usually all Internet e-mail is transmitted in MIME format, allowing messages to have a tree structure where the leaf nodes are any of a variety of single part content types and the non-leaf nodes are any of a variety of multipart types. The IMAP4 protocol allows clients to retrieve any of the individual MIME parts separately and also to retrieve portions of either individual parts or the entire message. These mechanisms allow clients to retrieve the text portion of a message without retrieving attached files or to stream content as it is being fetched.

===Message state information===
Through the use of flags defined in the IMAP4 protocol, clients can keep track of message state: for example, whether or not the message has been read, replied to, or deleted. These flags are stored on the server, so different clients accessing the same mailbox at different times can detect state changes made by other clients. POP provides no mechanism for clients to store such state information on the server so if a single user accesses a mailbox with two different POP clients (at different times), state information—such as whether a message has been accessed—cannot be synchronized between the clients. The IMAP4 protocol supports both predefined system flags and client-defined keywords. System flags indicate state information such as whether a message has been read. Keywords, which are not supported by all IMAP servers, allow messages to be given one or more tags whose meaning is up to the client. IMAP keywords should not be confused with proprietary labels of web-based e-mail services which are sometimes translated into IMAP folders by the corresponding proprietary servers.

===Multiple mailboxes on the server===
IMAP4 clients can create, rename, and delete mailboxes (usually presented to the user as folders) on the server, and copy messages between mailboxes. Multiple mailbox support also allows servers to provide access to shared and public folders. The &quot;IMAP4 Access Control List (ACL) Extension&quot; () may be used to regulate access rights.

===Server-side searches===
IMAP4 provides a mechanism for a client to ask the server to search for messages meeting a variety of criteria. This mechanism avoids requiring clients to download every message in the mailbox in order to perform these searches.

===Built-in extension mechanism===
Reflecting the experience of earlier Internet protocols, IMAP4 defines an explicit mechanism by which it may be extended. Many IMAP4 extensions to the base protocol have been proposed and are in common use. IMAP2bis did not have an extension mechanism, and POP now has one defined by .

===Server push notifications===
IMAP IDLE provides a way for the mail server to notify connected clients that there were changes to a mailbox, for example because a new mail has arrived. POP provides no comparable feature, and email clients need to periodically connect to the POP server to check for new mail.

==Disadvantages==
While IMAP remedies many of the shortcomings of POP, this inherently introduces additional complexity. Much of this complexity (e.g., multiple clients accessing the same mailbox at the same time) is compensated for by server-side workarounds such as Maildir or database backends.

The IMAP specification has been criticised for being insufficiently strict and allowing behaviours that effectively negate its usefulness. For instance, the specification states that each message stored on the server has a &quot;unique id&quot; to allow the clients to identify messages they have already seen between sessions. However, the specification also allows these UIDs to be invalidated with almost no restrictions, practically defeating their purpose.

From an administrative and resource point of view, the IMAP protocol can be viewed as an early implementation of cloud computing, as the intent and purpose of IMAP is to maintain your mailbox structure (content, folder structure, individual message state, etc) on the mail server, whereas with POP, this is all maintained on the user&#x27;s local device. Thus, IMAP requires far more server side resources, incurring a significantly higher cost per mailbox.

Unless the mail storage, indexing and searching algorithms on the server are carefully implemented, a client can potentially consume large amounts of server resources when searching massive mailboxes.

IMAP4 clients need to maintain a TCP/IP connection to the IMAP server in order to be notified of the arrival of new mail. Notification of mail arrival is done through in-band signaling, which contributes to the complexity of client-side IMAP protocol handling somewhat. A private proposal, push IMAP, would extend IMAP to implement push e-mail by sending the entire message instead of just a notification. However, push IMAP has not been generally accepted and current IETF work has addressed the problem in other ways (see the Lemonade Profile for more information).

Unlike some proprietary protocols which combine sending and retrieval operations, sending a message and saving a copy in a server-side folder with a base-level IMAP client requires transmitting the message content twice, once to SMTP for delivery and a second time to IMAP to store in a sent mail folder. This is addressed by a set of extensions defined by the IETF Lemonade Profile for mobile devices: URLAUTH () and CATENATE () in IMAP, and BURL () in SMTP-SUBMISSION. In addition to this, Courier Mail Server offers a non-standard method of sending using IMAP by copying an outgoing message to a dedicated outbox folder.

== Security ==
To cryptographically protect IMAP connections between the client and server, IMAPS on TCP port 993 can be used, which utilizes SSL/TLS. As of January 2018, TLS is the recommended mechanism.

Alternatively, STARTTLS can be used to encrypt the connection when connecting to port 143 after initially communicating over plaintext.

<doc id="14838" wikidata="Q192735" url="?curid=14838" title="Inertial frame of reference">
<text>In classical physics and special relativity, an inertial frame of reference (also called an inertial space or a Galilean reference frame) is a frame of reference in which objects exhibit inertia: they remain at rest or in uniform motion relative to the frame until acted upon by external forces. In such a frame, the laws of nature can be observed without the need to correct for acceleration.

All frames of reference with zero acceleration are in a state of constant rectilinear motion (straight-line motion) with respect to one another. In such a frame, an object with zero net force acting on it, is perceived to move with a constant velocity, or, equivalently, Newton&#x27;s first law of motion holds. Such frames are known as inertial. Some physicists, like Isaac Newton, originally thought that one of these frames was absolute — the one approximated by the fixed stars. However, this is not required for the definition, and it is now known that those stars are in fact moving.

According to the principle of special relativity, all physical laws look the same in all inertial reference frames, and no inertial frame is privileged over another. Measurements of objects in one inertial frame can be converted to measurements in another by a simple transformation — the Galilean transformation in Newtonian physics or the Lorentz transformation (combined with a translation) in special relativity; these approximately match when the relative speed of the frames is low, but differ as it approaches the speed of light.

By contrast, a &quot;non-inertial reference frame&quot; has non-zero acceleration. In such a frame, the interactions between physical objects vary depending on the acceleration of that frame with respect to an inertial frame. Viewed from the perspective of classical mechanics and special relativity, the usual physical forces caused by the interaction of objects have to be supplemented by fictitious forces caused by inertia. 
Viewed from the perspective of general relativity theory, the fictitious (i.e. inertial) forces are attributed to geodesic motion in spacetime.

Due to Earth&#x27;s rotation, its surface is not an inertial frame of reference. The Coriolis effect can deflect certain forms of motion as seen from Earth, and the centrifugal force will reduce the effective gravity at the equator. Nevertheless, for many applications the Earth is an adequate approximation of an inertial reference frame.

==Introduction==
The motion of a body can only be described relative to something else—other bodies, observers, or a set of spacetime coordinates. These are called frames of reference. According to the first postulate of special relativity, all physical laws take their simplest form in an inertial frame, and there exist multiple inertial frames interrelated by uniform translation:
This simplicity manifests itself in that inertial frames have self-contained physics without the need for external causes, while physics in non-inertial frames has external causes. The principle of simplicity can be used within Newtonian physics as well as in special relativity:

However, this definition of inertial frames is understood to apply in the Newtonian realm and ignores relativistic effects.

In practical terms, the equivalence of inertial reference frames means that scientists within a box moving with a constant absolute velocity cannot determine this velocity by any experiment. Otherwise, the differences would set up an absolute standard reference frame. According to this definition, supplemented with the constancy of the speed of light, inertial frames of reference transform among themselves according to the Poincaré group of symmetry transformations, of which the Lorentz transformations are a subgroup. In Newtonian mechanics, inertial frames of reference are related by the Galilean group of symmetries.

==Newton&#x27;s inertial frame of reference==

===Absolute space===

Newton posited an absolute space considered well-approximated by a frame of reference stationary relative to the fixed stars. An inertial frame was then one in uniform translation relative to absolute space. However, some &quot;relativists&quot;, even at the time of Newton, felt that absolute space was a defect of the formulation, and should be replaced.

The expression &quot;inertial frame of reference&quot; () was coined by Ludwig Lange in 1885, to replace Newton&#x27;s definitions of &quot;absolute space and time&quot; with a more operational definition: 

The inadequacy of the notion of &quot;absolute space&quot; in Newtonian mechanics is spelled out by Blagojevich:

The utility of operational definitions was carried much further in the special theory of relativity. Some historical background including Lange&#x27;s definition is provided by DiSalle, who says in summary:

===Newtonian mechanics===

Classical theories that use the Galilean transformation postulate the equivalence of all inertial reference frames. The Galilean transformation transforms coordinates from one inertial reference frame, formula_1, to another, formula_2, by simple addition or subtraction of coordinates:

:formula_3

:formula_4

where r0 and &quot;t&quot;0 represent shifts in the origin of space and time, and v is the relative velocity of the two inertial reference frames. Under Galilean transformations, the time &quot;t&quot;2 − &quot;t&quot;1 between two events is the same for all reference frames and the distance between two simultaneous events (or, equivalently, the length of any object, |r2 − r1|) is also the same.

Within the realm of Newtonian mechanics, an inertial frame of reference, or inertial reference frame, is one in which Newton&#x27;s first law of motion is valid. However, the principle of special relativity generalizes the notion of an inertial frame to include all physical laws, not simply Newton&#x27;s first law.

Newton viewed the first law as valid in any reference frame that is in uniform motion (neither rotating nor accelerating) relative to absolute space; as a practical matter, &quot;absolute space&quot; was considered to be the fixed stars In the theory of relativity the notion of absolute space or a privileged frame is abandoned, and an inertial frame in the field of classical mechanics is defined as:

Hence, with respect to an inertial frame, an object or body accelerates only when a physical force is applied, and (following Newton&#x27;s first law of motion), in the absence of a net force, a body at rest will remain at rest and a body in motion will continue to move uniformly—that is, in a straight line and at constant speed. Newtonian inertial frames transform among each other according to the Galilean group of symmetries.

If this rule is interpreted as saying that straight-line motion is an indication of zero net force, the rule does not identify inertial reference frames because straight-line motion can be observed in a variety of frames. If the rule is interpreted as defining an inertial frame, then being able to determine when zero net force is applied is crucial. The problem was summarized by Einstein:

There are several approaches to this issue. One approach is to argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, so it is only needed that a body is far enough away from all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach&#x27;s principle). Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is the possibility of missing something, or accounting inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach&#x27;s principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach is to look at the way the forces transform when shifting reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. Based on the universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.

Newton enunciated a principle of relativity himself in one of his corollaries to the laws of motion: 

This principle differs from the special principle in two ways: first, it is restricted to mechanics, and second, it makes no mention of simplicity. It shares the special principle of the invariance of the form of the description among mutually translating reference frames. The role of fictitious forces in classifying reference frames is pursued further below.

==Special relativity==
Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity, like Newtonian mechanics, postulates the equivalence of all inertial reference frames. However, because special relativity postulates that the speed of light in free space is invariant, the transformation between inertial frames is the Lorentz transformation, not the Galilean transformation which is used in Newtonian mechanics.

The invariance of the speed of light leads to counter-intuitive phenomena, such as time dilation, length contraction, and the relativity of simultaneity. The predictions of special relativity have been extensively verified experimentally. The Lorentz transformation reduces to the Galilean transformation as the speed of light approaches infinity or as the relative velocity between frames approaches zero.

== Examples ==

=== Simple example ===

Consider a situation common in everyday life. Two cars travel along a road, both moving at constant velocities. See Figure 1. At some particular moment, they are separated by 200 meters. The car in front is traveling at 22 meters per second and the car behind is traveling at 30 meters per second. If we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first, there are three obvious &quot;frames of reference&quot; that we could choose.

First, we could observe the two cars from the side of the road. We define our &quot;frame of reference&quot; &quot;S&quot; as follows. We stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us, which happens to be when they are a distance apart. Since neither of the cars is accelerating, we can determine their positions by the following formulas, where formula_5 is the position in meters of car one after time &quot;t&quot; in seconds and formula_6 is the position of car two after time &quot;t&quot;.

: formula_7

Notice that these formulas predict at &quot;t&quot; = 0 s the first car is 200m down the road and the second car is right beside us, as expected. We want to find the time at which formula_8. Therefore, we set formula_8 and solve for formula_10, that is:

: formula_11
: formula_12
: formula_13

Alternatively, we could choose a frame of reference &quot;S′&quot; situated in the first car. In this case, the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of . To catch up to the first car, it will take a time of , that is, 25 seconds, as before. Note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference. The third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car. That example resembles the case just discussed, except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at .

It would have been possible to choose a rotating, accelerating frame of reference, moving in a complicated manner, but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily. One can convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another. For example, suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time. If you know that this is the case, when somebody asks you what time it is, you can deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch to obtain the correct time. The measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer&#x27;s frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three, when in fact it arrived at three).

=== Additional example ===

For a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers, consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a north-south street. See Figure 2. A car drives past them heading south. For the person facing east, the car was moving to the right. However, for the person facing west, the car was moving to the left. This discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system.

For a more complex example involving observers in relative motion, consider Alfred, who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right. In his frame of reference, Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin, the road as the -axis, and the direction in front of him as the positive -axis. To him, the car moves along the axis with some velocity in the positive -direction. Alfred&#x27;s frame of reference is considered an inertial frame because he is not accelerating, ignoring effects such as Earth&#x27;s rotation and gravity.

Now consider Betsy, the person driving the car. Betsy, in choosing her frame of reference, defines her location as the origin, the direction to her right as the positive -axis, and the direction in front of her as the positive -axis. In this frame of reference, it is Betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving – for instance, as she drives past Alfred, she observes him moving with velocity in the negative -direction. If she is driving north, then north is the positive -direction; if she turns east, east becomes the positive -direction.

Finally, as an example of non-inertial observers, assume Candace is accelerating her car. As she passes by him, Alfred measures her acceleration and finds it to be in the negative -direction. Assuming Candace&#x27;s acceleration is constant, what acceleration does Betsy measure? If Betsy&#x27;s velocity is constant, she is in an inertial frame of reference, and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference, in the negative -direction. However, if she is accelerating at rate in the negative -direction (in other words, slowing down), she will find Candace&#x27;s acceleration to be in the negative -direction—a smaller value than Alfred has measured. Similarly, if she is accelerating at rate &quot;A&quot; in the positive -direction (speeding up), she will observe Candace&#x27;s acceleration as in the negative -direction—a larger value than Alfred&#x27;s measurement.

== Non-inertial frames ==

Here the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered. The basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces, as described below.

===General relativity===
General relativity is based upon the principle of equivalence:
This idea was introduced in Einstein&#x27;s 1907 article &quot;Principle of Relativity and Gravitation&quot; and later developed in 1911. Support for this principle is found in the Eötvös experiment, which determines whether the ratio of inertial to gravitational mass is the same for all bodies, regardless of size or composition. To date no difference has been found to a few parts in 1011. For some discussion of the subtleties of the Eötvös experiment, such as the local mass distribution around the experimental site (including a quip about the mass of Eötvös himself), see Franklin.

Einstein&#x27;s general theory modifies the distinction between nominally &quot;inertial&quot; and &quot;non-inertial&quot; effects by replacing special relativity&#x27;s &quot;flat&quot; Minkowski Space with a metric that produces non-zero curvature. In general relativity, the principle of inertia is replaced with the principle of geodesic motion, whereby objects move in a way dictated by the curvature of spacetime. As a consequence of this curvature, it is not a given in general relativity that inertial objects moving at a particular rate with respect to each other will continue to do so. This phenomenon of geodesic deviation means that inertial frames of reference do not exist globally as they do in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.

However, the general theory reduces to the special theory over sufficiently small regions of spacetime, where curvature effects become less important and the earlier inertial frame arguments can come back into play. Consequently, modern special relativity is now sometimes described as only a &quot;local theory&quot;. &quot;Local&quot; can encompass, for example, the entire Milky Way galaxy: The astronomer Karl Schwarzschild observed the motion of pairs of stars orbiting each other. He found that the two orbits of the stars of such a system lie in a plane, and the perihelion of the orbits of the two stars remains pointing in the same direction with respect to the Solar System. Schwarzschild pointed out that that was invariably seen: the direction of the angular momentum of all observed double star systems remains fixed with respect to the direction of the angular momentum of the Solar System. These observations allowed him to conclude that inertial frames inside the galaxy do not rotate with respect to one another, and that the space of the Milky Way is approximately Galilean or Minkowskian.

===Inertial frames and rotation===

In an inertial frame, Newton&#x27;s first law, the &quot;law of inertia&quot;, is satisfied: Any free motion has a constant magnitude and direction. Newton&#x27;s second law for a particle takes the form:

:formula_14

with F the net force (a vector), &quot;m&quot; the mass of a particle and a the acceleration of the particle (also a vector) which would be measured by an observer at rest in the frame. The force F is the vector sum of all &quot;real&quot; forces on the particle, such as contact forces, electromagnetic, gravitational, and nuclear forces.

In contrast, Newton&#x27;s second law in a rotating frame of reference (a non-inertial frame of reference), rotating at angular rate &quot;Ω&quot; about an axis, takes the form:

:formula_15

which looks the same as in an inertial frame, but now the force F′ is the resultant of not only F, but also additional terms (the paragraph following this equation presents the main points without detailed mathematics):

:formula_16

where the angular rotation of the frame is expressed by the vector Ω pointing in the direction of the axis of rotation, and with magnitude equal to the angular rate of rotation &quot;Ω&quot;, symbol × denotes the vector cross product, vector x&quot;B&quot; locates the body and vector v&quot;B&quot; is the velocity of the body according to a rotating observer (different from the velocity seen by the inertial observer).

The extra terms in the force F′ are the &quot;fictitious&quot; forces for this frame, whose causes are external to the system in the frame. The first extra term is the Coriolis force, the second the centrifugal force, and the third the Euler force. These terms all have these properties: they vanish when &quot;Ω&quot; = 0; that is, they are zero for an inertial frame (which, of course, does not rotate); they take on a different magnitude and direction in every rotating frame, depending upon its particular value of Ω; they are ubiquitous in the rotating frame (affect every particle, regardless of circumstance); and they have no apparent source in identifiable physical sources, in particular, matter. Also, fictitious forces do not drop off with distance (unlike, for example, nuclear forces or electrical forces). For example, the centrifugal force that appears to emanate from the axis of rotation in a rotating frame increases with distance from the axis.

All observers agree on the real forces, F; only non-inertial observers need fictitious forces. The laws of physics in the inertial frame are simpler because unnecessary forces are not present.

In Newton&#x27;s time the fixed stars were invoked as a reference frame, supposedly at rest relative to absolute space. In reference frames that were either at rest with respect to the fixed stars or in uniform translation relative to these stars, Newton&#x27;s laws of motion were supposed to hold. In contrast, in frames accelerating with respect to the fixed stars, an important case being frames rotating relative to the fixed stars, the laws of motion did not hold in their simplest form, but had to be supplemented by the addition of fictitious forces, for example, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force. Two experiments were devised by Newton to demonstrate how these forces could be discovered, thereby revealing to an observer that they were not in an inertial frame: the example of the tension in the cord linking two spheres rotating about their center of gravity, and the example of the curvature of the surface of water in a rotating bucket. In both cases, application of Newton&#x27;s second law would not work for the rotating observer without invoking centrifugal and Coriolis forces to account for their observations (tension in the case of the spheres; parabolic water surface in the case of the rotating bucket).

As now known, the fixed stars are not fixed. Those that reside in the Milky Way turn with the galaxy, exhibiting proper motions. Those that are outside our galaxy (such as nebulae once mistaken to be stars) participate in their own motion as well, partly due to expansion of the universe, and partly due to peculiar velocities. For instance, the Andromeda Galaxy is on collision course with the Milky Way at a speed of 117 km/s. The concept of inertial frames of reference is no longer tied to either the fixed stars or to absolute space. Rather, the identification of an inertial frame is based on the simplicity of the laws of physics in the frame. 
The laws of nature take a simpler form in inertial frames of reference because in these frames one did not have to introduce inertial forces when writing down Newton&#x27;s law of motion.

In practice, using a frame of reference based upon the fixed stars as though it were an inertial frame of reference introduces little discrepancy. For example, the centrifugal acceleration of the Earth because of its rotation about the Sun is about thirty million times greater than that of the Sun about the galactic center.

To illustrate further, consider the question: &quot;Does the Universe rotate?&quot; An answer might explain the shape of the Milky Way galaxy using the laws of physics, although other observations might be more definitive; that is, provide larger discrepancies or less measurement uncertainty, like the anisotropy of the microwave background radiation or Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The flatness of the Milky Way depends on its rate of rotation in an inertial frame of reference. If its apparent rate of rotation is attributed entirely to rotation in an inertial frame, a different &quot;flatness&quot; is predicted than if it is supposed that part of this rotation is actually due to rotation of the universe and should not be included in the rotation of the galaxy itself. Based upon the laws of physics, a model is set up in which one parameter is the rate of rotation of the Universe. If the laws of physics agree more accurately with observations in a model with rotation than without it, we are inclined to select the best-fit value for rotation, subject to all other pertinent experimental observations. If no value of the rotation parameter is successful and theory is not within observational error, a modification of physical law is considered, for example, dark matter is invoked to explain the galactic rotation curve. So far, observations show any rotation of the universe is very slow, no faster than once every years (10−13 rad/yr), and debate persists over whether there is &quot;any&quot; rotation. However, if rotation were found, interpretation of observations in a frame tied to the universe would have to be corrected for the fictitious forces inherent in such rotation in classical physics and special relativity, or interpreted as the curvature of spacetime and the motion of matter along the geodesics in general relativity.

When quantum effects are important, there are additional conceptual complications that arise in quantum reference frames.

===Primed frames===

An accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the &quot;primed&quot; frame, and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes, e.g. &quot;x′&quot;, &quot;y′&quot;, &quot;a′&quot;.

The vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as R. Given a point of interest that exists in both frames, the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called r, and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called r′.

These equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems; for example, Newton&#x27;s second law can be written as

: formula_20

When there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia. If an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking, the batteries are recharged, illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia. However, the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration), for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force. Seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in centrifugal direction, or in a direction orthogonal to an object&#x27;s motion, the Coriolis effect).

A common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried).

This arrangement leads to the equation (see Fictitious force for a derivation):

: formula_21

or, to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame,

: formula_22

Multiplying through by the mass &quot;m&quot; gives

: formula_23

where

: formula_25 (Coriolis force),
: formula_26 (centrifugal force).

==Separating non-inertial from inertial reference frames==

===Theory===


Inertial and non-inertial reference frames can be distinguished by the absence or presence of fictitious forces. 
The presence of fictitious forces indicates the physical laws are not the simplest laws available, in terms of the special principle of relativity, a frame where fictitious forces are present is not an inertial frame:

Bodies in non-inertial reference frames are subject to so-called &quot;fictitious&quot; forces (pseudo-forces); that is, forces that result from the acceleration of the reference frame itself and not from any physical force acting on the body. Examples of fictitious forces are the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force in rotating reference frames.

To apply the Newtonian definition of an inertial frame, the understanding of separation between &quot;fictitious&quot; forces and &quot;real&quot; forces must be made clear.

For example, consider a stationary object in an inertial frame. Being at rest, no net force is applied. But in a frame rotating about a fixed axis, the object appears to move in a circle, and is subject to centripetal force. How can it be decided that the rotating frame is a non-inertial frame? There are two approaches to this resolution: one approach is to look for the origin of the fictitious forces (the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force). It will be found there are no sources for these forces, no associated force carriers, no originating bodies. A second approach is to look at a variety of frames of reference. For any inertial frame, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force disappear, so application of the principle of special relativity would identify these frames where the forces disappear as sharing the same and the simplest physical laws, and hence rule that the rotating frame is not an inertial frame.

Newton examined this problem himself using rotating spheres, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. He pointed out that if the spheres are not rotating, the tension in the tying string is measured as zero in every frame of reference. If the spheres only appear to rotate (that is, we are watching stationary spheres from a rotating frame), the zero tension in the string is accounted for by observing that the centripetal force is supplied by the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in combination, so no tension is needed. If the spheres really are rotating, the tension observed is exactly the centripetal force required by the circular motion. Thus, measurement of the tension in the string identifies the inertial frame: it is the one where the tension in the string provides exactly the centripetal force demanded by the motion as it is observed in that frame, and not a different value. That is, the inertial frame is the one where the fictitious forces vanish.

For linear acceleration, Newton expressed the idea of undetectability of straight-line accelerations held in common:

This principle generalizes the notion of an inertial frame. For example, an observer confined in a free-falling lift will assert that he himself is a valid inertial frame, even if he is accelerating under gravity, so long as he has no knowledge about anything outside the lift. So, strictly speaking, inertial frame is a relative concept. With this in mind, inertial frames can collectively be defined as a set of frames which are stationary or moving at constant velocity with respect to each other, so that a single inertial frame is defined as an element of this set.

For these ideas to apply, everything observed in the frame has to be subject to a base-line, common acceleration shared by the frame itself. That situation would apply, for example, to the elevator example, where all objects are subject to the same gravitational acceleration, and the elevator itself accelerates at the same rate.

===Applications===
Inertial navigation systems used a cluster of gyroscopes and accelerometers to determine accelerations relative to inertial space. After a gyroscope is spun up in a particular orientation in inertial space, the law of conservation of angular momentum requires that it retain that orientation as long as no external forces are applied to it. Three orthogonal gyroscopes establish an inertial reference frame, and the accelerators measure acceleration relative to that frame. The accelerations, along with a clock, can then be used to calculate the change in position. Thus, inertial navigation is a form of dead reckoning that requires no external input, and therefore cannot be jammed by any external or internal signal source.

A gyrocompass, employed for navigation of seagoing vessels, finds the geometric north. It does so, not by sensing the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, but by using inertial space as its reference. The outer casing of the gyrocompass device is held in such a way that it remains aligned with the local plumb line. When the gyroscope wheel inside the gyrocompass device is spun up, the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its spinning axis with the Earth&#x27;s axis. Alignment with the Earth&#x27;s axis is the only direction for which the gyroscope&#x27;s spinning axis can be stationary with respect to the Earth and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space. After being spun up, a gyrocompass can reach the direction of alignment with the Earth&#x27;s axis in as little as a quarter of an hour.

<doc id="14843" wikidata="Q834826" url="?curid=14843" title="Interstellar travel">
<text>Interstellar travel is the hypothetical travel of spacecraft between star systems. Due to the vast distances between the Solar System and nearby stars, interstellar travel is not practicable with current propulsion technologies.

To travel between stars within a reasonable amount of time (decades or centuries), an interstellar spacecraft must reach a significant fraction of the speed of light, requiring enormous energy. Communication with such interstellar craft will experience years of delay due to the speed of light. Collisions with cosmic dust and gas at such speeds can be catastrophic for such spacecrafts. Crewed interstellar travel could possibly be conducted more slowly (far beyond the scale of a human lifetime) by making a generation ship. Hypothetical interstellar propulsion systems include nuclear pulse propulsion, fission-fragment rocket, fusion rocket, beamed solar sail, and antimatter rocket.

The benefits of interstellar travel include detailed surveys of habitable exoplanets and distant stars, comprehensive search for extraterrestrial intelligence and space colonization. Even though five uncrewed spacecraft have left our Solar System, they are not &quot;interstellar craft&quot; because they are not purposefully designed to explore other star systems. Thus, as of the 2020s, interstellar spaceflight remains a popular trope in speculative future studies and science fiction. A civilization that has mastered interstellar travel is called an interstellar species.

== Challenges ==

=== Interstellar distances ===
Distances between the planets in the Solar System are often measured in astronomical units (AU), defined as the average distance between the Sun and Earth, some . Venus, the closest planet to Earth is (at closest approach) 0.28 AU away. Neptune, the farthest planet from the Sun, is 29.8 AU away. As of January 20, 2023, Voyager 1, the farthest human-made object from Earth, is 163 AU away, exiting the Solar System at a speed of 17 km/s (0.006% of the speed of light).

The closest known star, Proxima Centauri, is approximately away, or over 9,000 times farther away than Neptune.


Because of this, distances between stars are usually expressed in light-years (defined as the distance that light travels in vacuum in one Julian year) or in parsecs (one parsec is 3.26 ly, the distance at which stellar parallax is exactly one arcsecond, hence the name). Light in a vacuum travels around per second, so 1 light-year is about or AU. Hence, Proxima Centauri is approximately 4.243 light-years from Earth.

Another way of understanding the vastness of interstellar distances is by scaling: One of the closest stars to the Sun, Alpha Centauri A (a Sun-like star that is one of two companions of Proxima Centauri), can be pictured by scaling down the Earth–Sun distance to . On this scale, the distance to Alpha Centauri A would be .

The fastest outward-bound spacecraft yet sent, Voyager 1, has covered 1/390 of a light-year in 46 years and is currently moving at 1/17,600 the speed of light. At this rate, a journey to Proxima Centauri would take 75,000 years.

=== Required energy ===
A significant factor contributing to the difficulty is the energy that must be supplied to obtain a reasonable travel time. A lower bound for the required energy is the kinetic energy formula_1 where formula_2 is the final mass. If deceleration on arrival is desired and cannot be achieved by any means other than the engines of the ship, then the lower bound for the required energy is doubled to formula_3.

The velocity for a crewed round trip of a few decades to even the nearest star is several thousand times greater than those of present space vehicles. This means that due to the formula_4 term in the kinetic energy formula, millions of times as much energy is required. Accelerating one ton to one-tenth of the speed of light requires at least (world energy consumption 2008 was 143,851 terawatt-hours), without factoring in efficiency of the propulsion mechanism. This energy has to be generated onboard from stored fuel, harvested from the interstellar medium, or projected over immense distances.

=== Interstellar medium ===
A knowledge of the properties of the interstellar gas and dust through which the vehicle must pass is essential for the design of any interstellar space mission. A major issue with traveling at extremely high speeds is that, due to the requisite high relative speeds and large kinetic energies, collisions with interstellar dust could cause considerable damage to the craft. Various shielding methods to mitigate this problem have been proposed. Larger objects (such as macroscopic dust grains) are far less common, but would be much more destructive. The risks of impacting such objects and mitigation methods have been discussed in literature, but many unknowns remain. An additional consideration is that, due to the non-homogeneous distribution of interstellar matter around the Sun, these risks would vary between different trajectories. Although a high density interstellar medium may cause difficulties for many interstellar travel concepts, interstellar ramjets, and some proposed concepts for decelerating interstellar spacecraft, would actually benefit from a denser interstellar medium.

=== Hazards ===
The crew of an interstellar ship would face several significant hazards, including the psychological effects of long-term isolation, the physiological effects of extreme acceleration, the effects of exposure to ionising radiation, and the physiological effects of weightlessness to the muscles, joints, bones, immune system, and eyes. There also exists the risk of impact by micrometeoroids and other space debris. These risks represent challenges that have yet to be overcome.

=== Wait calculation ===
The speculative fiction writer and physicist Robert L. Forward has argued that an interstellar mission that cannot be completed within 50 years should not be started at all. Instead, assuming that a civilization is still on an increasing curve of propulsion system velocity and not yet having reached the limit, the resources should be invested in designing a better propulsion system. This is because a slow spacecraft would probably be passed by another mission sent later with more advanced propulsion (the incessant obsolescence postulate). In 2006, Andrew Kennedy calculated ideal departure dates for a trip to Barnard&#x27;s Star using a more precise concept of the wait calculation where for a given destination and growth rate in propulsion capacity there is a departure point that overtakes earlier launches and will not be overtaken by later ones and concluded &quot;an interstellar journey of 6 light years can best be made in about 635 years from now if growth continues at about 1.4% per annum&quot;, or approximately 2641 AD. It may be the most significant calculation for competing cultures occupying the galaxy.

== Prime targets for interstellar travel ==
There are 59 known stellar systems within 40 light years of the Sun, containing 81 visible stars. The following could be considered prime targets for interstellar missions:

Existing astronomical technology is capable of finding planetary systems around these objects, increasing their potential for exploration.

== Proposed methods ==

=== Slow, uncrewed probes ===

&quot;Slow&quot; interstellar missions (still fast by other standards) based on current and near-future propulsion technologies are associated with trip times starting from about several decades to thousands of years. These missions consist of sending a robotic probe to a nearby star for exploration, similar to interplanetary probes like those used in the Voyager program. By taking along no crew, the cost and complexity of the mission is significantly reduced, as is the mass that needs to be accelerated, although technology lifetime is still a significant issue next to obtaining a reasonable speed of travel. Proposed concepts include Project Daedalus, Project Icarus, Project Dragonfly, Project Longshot, and more recently Breakthrough Starshot.

=== Fast, uncrewed probes ===
==== Nanoprobes ====

Near-lightspeed nano spacecraft might be possible within the near future built on existing microchip technology with a newly developed nanoscale thruster. Researchers at the University of Michigan are developing thrusters that use nanoparticles as propellant. Their technology is called &quot;nanoparticle field extraction thruster&quot;, or nanoFET. These devices act like small particle accelerators shooting conductive nanoparticles out into space.

Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist, has suggested that clouds of &quot;smart dust&quot; be sent to the stars, which may become possible with advances in nanotechnology. Kaku also notes that a large number of nanoprobes would need to be sent due to the vulnerability of very small probes to be easily deflected by magnetic fields, micrometeorites and other dangers to ensure the chances that at least one nanoprobe will survive the journey and reach the destination.

As a near-term solution, small, laser-propelled interstellar probes, based on current CubeSat technology were proposed in the context of Project Dragonfly.

=== Slow, crewed missions ===
In crewed missions, the duration of a slow interstellar journey presents a major obstacle and existing concepts deal with this problem in different ways. They can be distinguished by the &quot;state&quot; in which humans are transported on-board of the spacecraft.

==== Generation ships ====

A generation ship (or world ship) is a type of interstellar ark in which the crew that arrives at the destination is descended from those who started the journey. Generation ships are not currently feasible because of the difficulty of constructing a ship of the enormous required scale and the great biological and sociological problems that life aboard such a ship raises.

==== Suspended animation ====
Scientists and writers have postulated various techniques for suspended animation. These include human hibernation and cryonic preservation. Although neither is currently practical, they offer the possibility of sleeper ships in which the passengers lie inert for the long duration of the voyage.

==== Frozen embryos ====

A robotic interstellar mission carrying some number of frozen early stage human embryos is another theoretical possibility. This method of space colonization requires, among other things, the development of an artificial uterus, the prior detection of a habitable terrestrial planet, and advances in the field of fully autonomous mobile robots and educational robots that would replace human parents.

==== Island hopping through interstellar space ====
Interstellar space is not completely empty; it contains trillions of icy bodies ranging from small asteroids (Oort cloud) to possible rogue planets. There may be ways to take advantage of these resources for a good part of an interstellar trip, slowly hopping from body to body or setting up waystations along the way.

=== Fast, crewed missions ===
If a spaceship could average 10 percent of light speed (and decelerate at the destination, for human crewed missions), this would be enough to reach Proxima Centauri in forty years. Several propulsion concepts have been proposed that might be eventually developed to accomplish this (see § Propulsion below), but none of them are ready for near-term (few decades) developments at acceptable cost.

==== Time dilation ====
Physicists generally believe faster-than-light travel is impossible. 
Relativistic time dilation allows a traveler to experience time more slowly, the closer their speed is to the speed of light. This apparent slowing becomes noticeable when velocities above 80% of the speed of light are attained. Clocks aboard an interstellar ship would run slower than Earth clocks, so if a ship&#x27;s engines were capable of continuously generating around 1 g of acceleration (which is comfortable for humans), the ship could reach almost anywhere in the galaxy and return to Earth within 40 years ship-time (see diagram). Upon return, there would be a difference between the time elapsed on the astronaut&#x27;s ship and the time elapsed on Earth.

For example, a spaceship could travel to a star 32 light-years away, initially accelerating at a constant 1.03g (i.e. 10.1 m/s2) for 1.32 years (ship time), then stopping its engines and coasting for the next 17.3 years (ship time) at a constant speed, then decelerating again for 1.32 ship-years, and coming to a stop at the destination. After a short visit, the astronaut could return to Earth the same way. After the full round-trip, the clocks on board the ship show that 40 years have passed, but according to those on Earth, the ship comes back 76 years after launch.

From the viewpoint of the astronaut, onboard clocks seem to be running normally. The star ahead seems to be approaching at a speed of 0.87 light years per ship-year. The universe would appear contracted along the direction of travel to half the size it had when the ship was at rest; the distance between that star and the Sun would seem to be 16 light years as measured by the astronaut.

At higher speeds, the time on board will run even slower, so the astronaut could travel to the center of the Milky Way (30,000 light years from Earth) and back in 40 years ship-time. But the speed according to Earth clocks will always be less than 1 light year per Earth year, so, when back home, the astronaut will find that more than 60 thousand years will have passed on Earth.

==== Constant acceleration ====

Regardless of how it is achieved, a propulsion system that could produce acceleration continuously from departure to arrival would be the fastest method of travel. A constant acceleration journey is one where the propulsion system accelerates the ship at a constant rate for the first half of the journey, and then decelerates for the second half, so that it arrives at the destination stationary relative to where it began. If this were performed with an acceleration similar to that experienced at the Earth&#x27;s surface, it would have the added advantage of producing artificial &quot;gravity&quot; for the crew. Supplying the energy required, however, would be prohibitively expensive with current technology.

From the perspective of a planetary observer, the ship will appear to accelerate steadily at first, but then more gradually as it approaches the speed of light (which it cannot exceed). It will undergo hyperbolic motion. The ship will be close to the speed of light after about a year of accelerating and remain at that speed until it brakes for the end of the journey.

From the perspective of an onboard observer, the crew will feel a gravitational field opposite the engine&#x27;s acceleration, and the universe ahead will appear to fall in that field, undergoing hyperbolic motion. As part of this, distances between objects in the direction of the ship&#x27;s motion will gradually contract until the ship begins to decelerate, at which time an onboard observer&#x27;s experience of the gravitational field will be reversed.

When the ship reaches its destination, if it were to exchange a message with its origin planet, it would find that less time had elapsed on board than had elapsed for the planetary observer, due to time dilation and length contraction.

The result is an impressively fast journey for the crew.

== Propulsion ==

=== Rocket concepts ===
All rocket concepts are limited by the rocket equation, which sets the characteristic velocity available as a function of exhaust velocity and mass ratio, the ratio of initial (&quot;M&quot;0, including fuel) to final (&quot;M&quot;1, fuel depleted) mass.

Very high specific power, the ratio of thrust to total vehicle mass, is required to reach interstellar targets within sub-century time-frames. Some heat transfer is inevitable, resulting in an extreme thermal load.

Thus, for interstellar rocket concepts of all technologies, a key engineering problem (seldom explicitly discussed) is limiting the heat transfer from the exhaust stream back into the vehicle.

==== Ion engine ====
A type of electric propulsion, spacecraft such as &quot;Dawn&quot; use an ion engine. In an ion engine, electric power is used to create charged particles of the propellant, usually the gas xenon, and accelerate them to extremely high velocities. The exhaust velocity of conventional rockets is limited to about 5 km/s by the chemical energy stored in the fuel&#x27;s molecular bonds. They produce a high thrust (about 106 N), but they have a low specific impulse, and that limits their top speed. By contrast, ion engines have low force, but the top speed in principle is limited only by the electrical power available on the spacecraft and on the gas ions being accelerated. The exhaust speed of the charged particles range from 15 km/s to 35 km/s.

==== Nuclear fission powered ====

===== Fission-electric =====
Nuclear-electric or plasma engines, operating for long periods at low thrust and powered by fission reactors, have the potential to reach speeds much greater than chemically powered vehicles or nuclear-thermal rockets. Such vehicles probably have the potential to power solar system exploration with reasonable trip times within the current century. Because of their low-thrust propulsion, they would be limited to off-planet, deep-space operation. Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion powered by a portable power-source, say a nuclear reactor, producing only small accelerations, would take centuries to reach for example 15% of the velocity of light, thus unsuitable for interstellar flight during a single human lifetime.

===== Fission-fragment =====
Fission-fragment rockets use nuclear fission to create high-speed jets of fission fragments, which are ejected at speeds of up to . With fission, the energy output is approximately 0.1% of the total mass-energy of the reactor fuel and limits the effective exhaust velocity to about 5% of the velocity of light. For maximum velocity, the reaction mass should optimally consist of fission products, the &quot;ash&quot; of the primary energy source, so no extra reaction mass need be bookkept in the mass ratio.

===== Nuclear pulse =====

Based on work in the late 1950s to the early 1960s, it has been technically possible to build spaceships with nuclear pulse propulsion engines, i.e. driven by a series of nuclear explosions. This propulsion system contains the prospect of very high specific impulse and high specific power.

Project Orion team member Freeman Dyson proposed in 1968 an interstellar spacecraft using nuclear pulse propulsion that used pure deuterium fusion detonations with a very high fuel-burnup fraction. He computed an exhaust velocity of 15,000 km/s and a 100,000-tonne space vehicle able to achieve a 20,000 km/s delta-v allowing a flight-time to Alpha Centauri of 130 years. Later studies indicate that the top cruise velocity that can theoretically be achieved by a Teller-Ulam thermonuclear unit powered Orion starship, assuming no fuel is saved for slowing back down, is about 8% to 10% of the speed of light (0.08-0.1c). An atomic (fission) Orion can achieve perhaps 3%-5% of the speed of light. A nuclear pulse drive starship powered by fusion-antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion units would be similarly in the 10% range and pure matter-antimatter annihilation rockets would be theoretically capable of obtaining a velocity between 50% and 80% of the speed of light. In each case saving fuel for slowing down halves the maximum speed. The concept of using a magnetic sail to decelerate the spacecraft as it approaches its destination has been discussed as an alternative to using propellant, this would allow the ship to travel near the maximum theoretical velocity. Alternative designs utilizing similar principles include Project Longshot, Project Daedalus, and Mini-Mag Orion. The principle of external nuclear pulse propulsion to maximize survivable power has remained common among serious concepts for interstellar flight without external power beaming and for very high-performance interplanetary flight.

In the 1970s the Nuclear Pulse Propulsion concept further was refined by Project Daedalus by use of externally triggered inertial confinement fusion, in this case producing fusion explosions via compressing fusion fuel pellets with high-powered electron beams. Since then, lasers, ion beams, neutral particle beams and hyper-kinetic projectiles have been suggested to produce nuclear pulses for propulsion purposes.

A current impediment to the development of &quot;any&quot; nuclear-explosion-powered spacecraft is the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty, which includes a prohibition on the detonation of any nuclear devices (even non-weapon based) in outer space. This treaty would, therefore, need to be renegotiated, although a project on the scale of an interstellar mission using currently foreseeable technology would probably require international cooperation on at least the scale of the International Space Station.

Another issue to be considered, would be the g-forces imparted to a rapidly accelerated spacecraft, cargo, and passengers inside (see Inertia negation).

==== Nuclear fusion rockets ====
Fusion rocket starships, powered by nuclear fusion reactions, should conceivably be able to reach speeds of the order of 10% of that of light, based on energy considerations alone. In theory, a large number of stages could push a vehicle arbitrarily close to the speed of light. These would &quot;burn&quot; such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, 3He, 11B, and 7Li. Because fusion yields about 0.3–0.9% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as released energy, it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases &lt;0.1% of the fuel&#x27;s mass-energy. The maximum exhaust velocities potentially energetically available are correspondingly higher than for fission, typically 4–10% of the speed of light. However, the most easily achievable fusion reactions release a large fraction of their energy as high-energy neutrons, which are a significant source of energy loss. Thus, although these concepts seem to offer the best (nearest-term) prospects for travel to the nearest stars within a (long) human lifetime, they still involve massive technological and engineering difficulties, which may turn out to be intractable for decades or centuries.

Early studies include Project Daedalus, performed by the British Interplanetary Society in 1973–1978, and Project Longshot, a student project sponsored by NASA and the US Naval Academy, completed in 1988. Another fairly detailed vehicle system, &quot;Discovery II&quot;, designed and optimized for crewed Solar System exploration, based on the D3He reaction but using hydrogen as reaction mass, has been described by a team from NASA&#x27;s Glenn Research Center. It achieves characteristic velocities of &gt;300 km/s with an acceleration of ~1.7•10−3 &quot;g&quot;, with a ship initial mass of ~1700 metric tons, and payload fraction above 10%. Although these are still far short of the requirements for interstellar travel on human timescales, the study seems to represent a reasonable benchmark towards what may be approachable within several decades, which is not impossibly beyond the current state-of-the-art. Based on the concept&#x27;s 2.2% burnup fraction it could achieve a pure fusion product exhaust velocity of ~3,000 km/s.

==== Antimatter rockets ====
An antimatter rocket would have a far higher energy density and specific impulse than any other proposed class of rocket. If energy resources and efficient production methods are found to make antimatter in the quantities required and store it safely, it would be theoretically possible to reach speeds of several tens of percent that of light. Whether antimatter propulsion could lead to the higher speeds (&gt;90% that of light) at which relativistic time dilation would become more noticeable, thus making time pass at a slower rate for the travelers as perceived by an outside observer, is doubtful owing to the large quantity of antimatter that would be required.

Speculating that production and storage of antimatter should become feasible, two further issues need to be considered. First, in the annihilation of antimatter, much of the energy is lost as high-energy gamma radiation, and especially also as neutrinos, so that only about 40% of &quot;mc&quot;2 would actually be available if the antimatter were simply allowed to annihilate into radiations thermally. Even so, the energy available for propulsion would be substantially higher than the ~1% of &quot;mc&quot;2 yield of nuclear fusion, the next-best rival candidate.

Second, heat transfer from the exhaust to the vehicle seems likely to transfer enormous wasted energy into the ship (e.g. for 0.1&quot;g&quot; ship acceleration, approaching 0.3 trillion watts per ton of ship mass), considering the large fraction of the energy that goes into penetrating gamma rays. Even assuming shielding was provided to protect the payload (and passengers on a crewed vehicle), some of the energy would inevitably heat the vehicle, and may thereby prove a limiting factor if useful accelerations are to be achieved.

More recently, Friedwardt Winterberg proposed that a matter-antimatter GeV gamma ray laser photon rocket is possible by a relativistic proton-antiproton pinch discharge, where the recoil from the laser beam is transmitted by the Mössbauer effect to the spacecraft.

==== Rockets with an external energy source ====
Rockets deriving their power from external sources, such as a laser, could replace their internal energy source with an energy collector, potentially reducing the mass of the ship greatly and allowing much higher travel speeds. Geoffrey A. Landis proposed an interstellar probe propelled by an ion thruster powered by the energy beamed to it from a base station laser. Lenard and Andrews proposed using a base station laser to accelerate nuclear fuel pellets towards a Mini-Mag Orion spacecraft that ignites them for propulsion.

=== Non-rocket concepts ===
A problem with all traditional rocket propulsion methods is that the spacecraft would need to carry its fuel with it, thus making it very massive, in accordance with the rocket equation. Several concepts attempt to escape from this problem:

==== RF resonant cavity thruster ====
A radio frequency (RF) resonant cavity thruster is a device that is claimed to be a spacecraft thruster. In 2016, the Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory at NASA reported observing a small apparent thrust from one such test, a result not since replicated. One of the designs is called EMDrive. In December 2002, Satellite Propulsion Research Ltd described a working prototype with an alleged total thrust of about 0.02 newtons powered by an 850 W cavity magnetron. The device could operate for only a few dozen seconds before the magnetron failed, due to overheating. The latest test on the EMDrive concluded that it does not work.

==== Helical engine ====
Proposed in 2019 by NASA scientist Dr. David Burns, the helical engine concept would use a particle accelerator to accelerate particles to near the speed of light. Since particles traveling at such speeds acquire more mass, it is believed that this mass change could create acceleration. According to Burns, the spacecraft could theoretically reach 99% the speed of light.

==== Interstellar ramjets ====
In 1960, Robert W. Bussard proposed the Bussard ramjet, a fusion rocket in which a huge scoop would collect the diffuse hydrogen in interstellar space, &quot;burn&quot; it on the fly using a proton–proton chain reaction, and expel it out of the back. Later calculations with more accurate estimates suggest that the thrust generated would be less than the drag caused by any conceivable scoop design. Yet the idea is attractive because the fuel would be collected &quot;en route&quot; (commensurate with the concept of &quot;energy harvesting&quot;), so the craft could theoretically accelerate to near the speed of light. The limitation is due to the fact that the reaction can only accelerate the propellant to 0.12c. Thus the drag of catching interstellar dust and the thrust of accelerating that same dust to 0.12c would be the same when the speed is 0.12c, preventing further acceleration.

==== Beamed propulsion ====
A light sail or magnetic sail powered by a massive laser or particle accelerator in the home star system could potentially reach even greater speeds than rocket- or pulse propulsion methods, because it would not need to carry its own reaction mass and therefore would only need to accelerate the craft&#x27;s payload. Robert L. Forward proposed a means for decelerating an interstellar craft with a light sail of 100 kilometers in the destination star system without requiring a laser array to be present in that system. In this scheme, a secondary sail of 30 kilometers is deployed to the rear of the spacecraft, while the large primary sail is detached from the craft to keep moving forward on its own. Light is reflected from the large primary sail to the secondary sail, which is used to decelerate the secondary sail and the spacecraft payload. In 2002, Geoffrey A. Landis of NASA&#x27;s Glen Research center also proposed a laser-powered, propulsion, sail ship that would host a diamond sail (of a few nanometers thick) powered with the use of solar energy. With this proposal, this interstellar ship would, theoretically, be able to reach 10 percent the speed of light. It has also been proposed to use beamed-powered propulsion to accelerate a spacecraft, and electromagnetic propulsion to decelerate it; thus, eliminating the problem that the Bussard ramjet has with the drag produced during acceleration.

A magnetic sail could also decelerate at its destination without depending on carried fuel or a driving beam in the destination system, by interacting with the plasma found in the solar wind of the destination star and the interstellar medium.

The following table lists some example concepts using beamed laser propulsion as proposed by the physicist Robert L. Forward:

=====Interstellar travel catalog to use photogravitational assists for a full stop=====
The following table is based on work by Heller, Hippke and Kervella.
* Successive assists at α Cen A and B could allow travel times to 75 yr to both stars.
* Lightsail has a nominal mass-to-surface ratio (σnom) of 8.6×10−4 gram m−2 for a nominal graphene-class sail.
* Area of the Lightsail, about 105 m2 = (316 m)2 
* Velocity up to 37,300 km s−1 (12.5% c)

==== Pre-accelerated fuel ====
Achieving start-stop interstellar trip times of less than a human lifetime require mass-ratios of between 1,000 and 1,000,000, even for the nearer stars. This could be achieved by multi-staged vehicles on a vast scale. Alternatively large linear accelerators could propel fuel to fission propelled space-vehicles, avoiding the limitations of the Rocket equation.

==== Dynamic soaring ====
Dynamic soaring as a way to travel across interstellar space has been proposed.

=== Theoretical concepts ===

==== Transmission of minds with light ====
Uploaded human minds or AI could be transmitted with laser or radio signals at the speed of light. This requires a receiver at the destination which would first have to be set up e.g. by humans, probes, self replicating machines (potentially along with AI or uploaded humans), or an alien civilization (which might also be in a different galaxy, perhaps a Kardashev type III civilization).

==== Artificial black hole ====
A theoretical idea for enabling interstellar travel is to propel a starship by creating an artificial black hole and using a parabolic reflector to reflect its Hawking radiation. Although beyond current technological capabilities, a black hole starship offers some advantages compared to other possible methods. Getting the black hole to act as a power source and engine also requires a way to convert the Hawking radiation into energy and thrust. One potential method involves placing the hole at the focal point of a parabolic reflector attached to the ship, creating forward thrust. A slightly easier, but less efficient method would involve simply absorbing all the gamma radiation heading towards the fore of the ship to push it onwards, and let the rest shoot out the back.

==== Faster-than-light travel ====

Scientists and authors have postulated a number of ways by which it might be possible to surpass the speed of light, but even the most serious-minded of these are highly speculative.

It is also debatable whether faster-than-light travel is physically possible, in part because of causality concerns: travel faster than light may, under certain conditions, permit travel backwards in time within the context of special relativity. Proposed mechanisms for faster-than-light travel within the theory of general relativity require the existence of exotic matter and, it is not known if it could be produced in sufficient quantities, if at all.

===== Alcubierre drive =====
In physics, the Alcubierre drive is based on an argument, within the framework of general relativity and without the introduction of wormholes, that it is possible to modify spacetime in a way that allows a spaceship to travel with an arbitrarily large speed by a local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it. Nevertheless, this concept would require the spaceship to incorporate a region of exotic matter, or the hypothetical concept of negative mass.

===== Wormholes =====
Wormholes are conjectural distortions in spacetime that theorists postulate could connect two arbitrary points in the universe, across an Einstein–Rosen Bridge. It is not known whether wormholes are possible in practice. Although there are solutions to the Einstein equation of general relativity that allow for wormholes, all of the currently known solutions involve some assumption, for example the existence of negative mass, which may be unphysical. However, Cramer &quot;et al.&quot; argue that such wormholes might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by cosmic strings. The general theory of wormholes is discussed by Visser in the book &quot;Lorentzian Wormholes&quot;.

== Designs and studies ==

=== Project Hyperion ===

Project Hyperion has looked into various feasibility issues of crewed interstellar travel. Notable results of the project include an assessment of world ship system architectures and adequate population size. Its members continue to publish on crewed interstellar travel in collaboration with the Initiative for Interstellar Studies.

=== Enzmann starship ===

The Enzmann starship, as detailed by G. Harry Stine in the October 1973 issue of &quot;Analog&quot;, was a design for a future starship, based on the ideas of Robert Duncan-Enzmann. The spacecraft itself as proposed used a 12,000,000 ton ball of frozen deuterium to power 12–24 thermonuclear pulse propulsion units. Twice as long as the Empire State Building is tall and assembled in-orbit, the spacecraft was part of a larger project preceded by interstellar probes and telescopic observation of target star systems.

=== NASA research ===
NASA has been researching interstellar travel since its formation, translating important foreign language papers and conducting early studies on applying fusion propulsion, in the 1960s, and laser propulsion, in the 1970s, to interstellar travel.

In 1994, NASA and JPL cosponsored a &quot;Workshop on Advanced Quantum/Relativity Theory Propulsion&quot; to &quot;establish and use new frames of reference for thinking about the faster-than-light (FTL) question&quot;.

The NASA Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program (terminated in FY 2003 after a 6-year, $1.2-million study, because &quot;No breakthroughs appear imminent.&quot;) identified some breakthroughs that are needed for interstellar travel to be possible.

Geoffrey A. Landis of NASA&#x27;s Glenn Research Center states that a laser-powered interstellar sail ship could possibly be launched within 50 years, using new methods of space travel. &quot;I think that ultimately we&#x27;re going to do it, it&#x27;s just a question of when and who,&quot; Landis said in an interview. Rockets are too slow to send humans on interstellar missions. Instead, he envisions interstellar craft with extensive sails, propelled by laser light to about one-tenth the speed of light. It would take such a ship about 43 years to reach Alpha Centauri if it passed through the system without stopping. Slowing down to stop at Alpha Centauri could increase the trip to 100 years, whereas a journey without slowing down raises the issue of making sufficiently accurate and useful observations and measurements during a fly-by.

=== 100 Year Starship study ===
The 100 Year Starship (100YSS) study was the name of a one-year project to assess the attributes of and lay the groundwork for an organization that can carry forward the 100 Year Starship vision. 100YSS-related symposia were organized between 2011 and 2015.

Harold (&quot;Sonny&quot;) White from NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center is a member of Icarus Interstellar, the nonprofit foundation whose mission is to realize interstellar flight before the year 2100. At the 2012 meeting of 100YSS, he reported using a laser to try to warp spacetime by 1 part in 10 million with the aim of helping to make interstellar travel possible.

== Feasibility ==
The energy requirements make interstellar travel very difficult. It has been reported that at the 2008 Joint Propulsion Conference, multiple experts opined that it was improbable that humans would ever explore beyond the Solar System. Brice N. Cassenti, an associate professor with the Department of Engineering and Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, stated that at least 100 times the total energy output of the entire world [in a given year] would be required to send a probe to the nearest star.

Astrophysicist Sten Odenwald stated that the basic problem is that through intensive studies of thousands of detected exoplanets, most of the closest destinations within 50 light years do not yield Earth-like planets in the star&#x27;s habitable zones. Given the multitrillion-dollar expense of some of the proposed technologies, travelers will have to spend up to 200 years traveling at 20% the speed of light to reach the best known destinations. Moreover, once the travelers arrive at their destination (by any means), they will not be able to travel down to the surface of the target world and set up a colony unless the atmosphere is non-lethal. The prospect of making such a journey, only to spend the rest of the colony&#x27;s life inside a sealed habitat and venturing outside in a spacesuit, may eliminate many prospective targets from the list.

Moving at a speed close to the speed of light and encountering even a tiny stationary object like a grain of sand will have fatal consequences. For example, a gram of matter moving at 90% of the speed of light contains a kinetic energy corresponding to a small nuclear bomb (around 30kt TNT).

One of the major stumbling blocks is having enough Onboard Spares &amp; Repairs facilities for such a lengthy time journey assuming all other considerations are solved, without access to all the resources available on Earth.

=== Interstellar missions not for human benefit ===

Explorative high-speed missions to Alpha Centauri, as planned for by the Breakthrough Starshot initiative, are projected to be realizable within the 21st century. It is alternatively possible to plan for uncrewed slow-cruising missions taking millennia to arrive. These probes would not be for human benefit in the sense that one can not foresee whether there would be anybody around on Earth interested in then back-transmitted science data. An example would be the Genesis mission, which aims to bring unicellular life, in the spirit of directed panspermia, to habitable but otherwise barren planets. Comparatively slow cruising Genesis probes, with a typical speed of formula_5, corresponding to about formula_6, can be decelerated using a magnetic sail. Uncrewed missions not for human benefit would hence be feasible.

== Discovery of Earth-like planets ==
On August 24, 2016, Earth-size exoplanet Proxima Centauri b orbiting in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, 4.2 light-years away, was announced. This is the nearest known potentially-habitable exoplanet outside our Solar System.

In February 2017, NASA announced that its Spitzer Space Telescope had revealed seven Earth-size planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star 40 light-years away from the Solar System. Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, the area around the parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water. The discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside the Solar System. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – the key to life as we know it – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.

<doc id="14844" wikidata="Q784844" url="?curid=14844" title="Interior Gateway Routing Protocol">
<text>Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) is a distance vector interior gateway protocol (IGP) developed by Cisco. It is used by routers to exchange routing data within an autonomous system.

IGRP is a proprietary protocol. IGRP was created in part to overcome the limitations of RIP (maximum hop count of only 15, and a single routing metric) when used within large networks. IGRP supports multiple metrics for each route, including bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability; to compare two routes these metrics are combined into a single metric, using a formula which can be adjusted through the use of pre-set constants. By default, the IGRP composite metric is a sum of the segment delays and the lowest segment bandwidth. The maximum configurable hop count of IGRP-routed packets is 255 (default 100), and routing updates are broadcast every 90 seconds (by default). IGRP uses protocol number 9 for communication.

IGRP is considered a classful routing protocol. Because the protocol has no field for a subnet mask, the router assumes that all subnetwork addresses within the same Class A, Class B, or Class C network have the same subnet mask as the subnet mask configured for the interfaces in question. This contrasts with classless routing protocols that can use variable length subnet masks. Classful protocols have become less popular as they are wasteful of IP address space.

==Advancement==
In order to address the issues of address space and other factors, Cisco created EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). EIGRP adds support for VLSM (variable length subnet mask) and adds the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) in order to improve routing and provide a loopless environment. EIGRP has completely replaced IGRP, making IGRP an obsolete routing protocol. In Cisco IOS versions 12.3 and greater, IGRP is completely unsupported. In the new Cisco CCNA curriculum (version 4), IGRP is mentioned only briefly, as an &quot;obsolete protocol&quot;.

<text>The Indo-European languages are a language family native to the northern Indian subcontinent, the overwhelming majority of Europe, and the Iranian plateau. Some European languages of this family—Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish—have expanded through colonialism in the modern period and are now spoken across several continents. The Indo-European family is divided into several branches or sub-families, of which there are eight groups with languages still alive today: Albanian, Armenian, Balto-Slavic, Celtic, Germanic, Hellenic, Indo-Iranian, and Italic; another nine subdivisions are now extinct.

Today, the individual Indo-European languages with the most native speakers are English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Hindustani, Bengali, French, and German; many others spoken by smaller groups are in danger of extinction.

Over 3.4 billion people (42% of the global population) speak an Indo-European language as a first language—by far the most of any language family. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to an estimate by &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, of which 313 belong to the Indo-Iranian branch.

All Indo-European languages are descended from a single prehistoric language, linguistically reconstructed as Proto-Indo-European, spoken sometime during the Neolithic or early Bronze Age (c. 3300 – c. 1200 BC). The geographical location where it was spoken, the Proto-Indo-European homeland, has been the object of many competing hypotheses; the academic consensus supports the Kurgan hypothesis, which posits the homeland to be the Pontic–Caspian steppe in what is now Ukraine and Southern Russia, associated with the Yamnaya culture and other related archaeological cultures during the 4th and early 3rd millennia BC. By the time the first written records appeared, Indo-European had already evolved into numerous languages spoken across much of Europe, South Asia, and part of Western Asia. Written evidence of Indo-European appeared during the Bronze Age in the form of Mycenaean Greek and the Anatolian languages of Hittite and Luwian. The oldest records are isolated Hittite words and names—interspersed in texts that are otherwise in the unrelated Akkadian language, a Semitic language—found in texts of the Assyrian colony of Kültepe in eastern Anatolia dating to the 20th century BC. Although no older written records of the original Proto-Indo-European population remain, some aspects of their culture and their religion can be reconstructed from later evidence in the daughter cultures. The Indo-European family is significant to the field of historical linguistics as it possesses the second-longest recorded history of any known family, after the Afroasiatic Egyptian language and Semitic languages. The analysis of the family relationships between the Indo-European languages, and the reconstruction of their common source, was central to the development of the methodology of historical linguistics as an academic discipline in the 19th century.

The Indo-European language family is not considered by the current academic consensus in the field of linguistics to have any genetic relationships with other language families, although several disputed hypotheses propose such relations.

==History of Indo-European linguistics==

During the 16th century, European visitors to the Indian subcontinent began to notice similarities among Indo-Aryan, Iranian, and European languages. In 1583, English Jesuit missionary and Konkani scholar Thomas Stephens wrote a letter from Goa to his brother (not published until the 20th century) in which he noted similarities between Indian languages and Greek and Latin.

Another account was made by Filippo Sassetti, a merchant born in Florence in 1540, who travelled to the Indian subcontinent. Writing in 1585, he noted some word similarities between Sanskrit and Italian (these included &quot;devaḥ&quot;/&quot;dio&quot; &quot;God&quot;, &quot;sarpaḥ&quot;/&quot;serpe&quot; &quot;serpent&quot;, &quot;sapta&quot;/&quot;sette&quot; &quot;seven&quot;, &quot;aṣṭa&quot;/&quot;otto&quot; &quot;eight&quot;, and &quot;nava&quot;/&quot;nove&quot; &quot;nine&quot;). However, neither Stephens&#x27; nor Sassetti&#x27;s observations led to further scholarly inquiry.

In 1647, Dutch linguist and scholar Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn noted the similarity among certain Asian and European languages and theorized that they were derived from a primitive common language that he called Scythian. He included in his hypothesis Dutch, Albanian, Greek, Latin, Persian, and German, later adding Slavic, Celtic, and Baltic languages. However, Van Boxhorn&#x27;s suggestions did not become widely known and did not stimulate further research.

Ottoman Turkish traveler Evliya Çelebi visited Vienna in 1665–1666 as part of a diplomatic mission and noted a few similarities between words in German and in Persian.
Gaston Coeurdoux and others made observations of the same type. Coeurdoux made a thorough comparison of Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek conjugations in the late 1760s to suggest a relationship among them. Meanwhile, Mikhail Lomonosov compared different language groups, including Slavic, Baltic (&quot;Kurlandic&quot;), Iranian (&quot;Medic&quot;), Finnish, Chinese, &quot;Hottentot&quot; (Khoekhoe), and others, noting that related languages (including Latin, Greek, German, and Russian) must have separated in antiquity from common ancestors.

The hypothesis reappeared in 1786 when Sir William Jones first lectured on the striking similarities among three of the oldest languages known in his time: Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit, to which he tentatively added Gothic, Celtic, and Persian, though his classification contained some inaccuracies and omissions. In one of the most famous quotations in linguistics, Jones made the following prescient statement in a lecture to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1786, conjecturing the existence of an earlier ancestor language, which he called &quot;a common source&quot; but did not name:
Thomas Young first used the term &quot;Indo-European&quot; in 1813, deriving it from the geographical extremes of the language family: from Western Europe to North India. A synonym is Indo-Germanic (&quot;Idg.&quot; or &quot;IdG.&quot;), specifying the family&#x27;s southeasternmost and northwesternmost branches. This first appeared in French (&quot;indo-germanique&quot;) in 1810 in the work of Conrad Malte-Brun; in most languages this term is now dated or less common than &quot;Indo-European&quot;, although in German &quot;indogermanisch&quot; remains the standard scientific term. A number of other synonymous terms have also been used.
Franz Bopp wrote in 1816 &quot;On the conjugational system of the Sanskrit language compared with that of Greek, Latin, Persian and Germanic&quot; and between 1833 and 1852 he wrote &quot;Comparative Grammar&quot;. This marks the beginning of Indo-European studies as an academic discipline. The classical phase of Indo-European comparative linguistics leads from this work to August Schleicher&#x27;s 1861 &quot;Compendium&quot; and up to Karl Brugmann&#x27;s &quot;Grundriss&quot;, published in the 1880s. Brugmann&#x27;s neogrammarian reevaluation of the field and Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s development of the laryngeal theory may be considered the beginning of &quot;modern&quot; Indo-European studies. The generation of Indo-Europeanists active in the last third of the 20th century (such as Calvert Watkins, Jochem Schindler, and Helmut Rix) developed a better understanding of morphology and of ablaut in the wake of Kuryłowicz&#x27;s 1956 &quot;Apophony in Indo-European,&quot; who in 1927 pointed out the existence of the Hittite consonant ḫ. Kuryłowicz&#x27;s discovery supported Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s 1879 proposal of the existence of &quot;coefficients sonantiques&quot;, elements de Saussure reconstructed to account for vowel length alternations in Indo-European languages. This led to the so-called laryngeal theory, a major step forward in Indo-European linguistics and a confirmation of de Saussure&#x27;s theory.

== Classification ==

The various subgroups of the Indo-European language family include ten major branches, listed below in alphabetical order:
* Albanian, attested from the 13th century; Proto-Albanian evolved from an ancient Paleo-Balkan language, traditionally thought to be Illyrian, or otherwise a totally unattested Balkan Indo-European language that was closely related to Illyrian and Messapic.
* Anatolian, extinct by Late Antiquity, spoken in Anatolia, attested in isolated terms in Luwian/Hittite mentioned in Semitic Old Assyrian texts from the 20th and 19th centuries BC, Hittite texts from about 1650 BC.
* Armenian, attested from the early 5th century AD. It evolved from the Proto-Armenian language which, according to the Armenian hypothesis, developed &quot;in situ&quot; from the Proto-Indo-European language of the 3rd millennium BC.
* Balto-Slavic, believed by most Indo-Europeanists to form a phylogenetic unit, while a minority ascribes similarities to prolonged language-contact.
** Slavic (from Proto-Slavic), attested from the 9th century AD (possibly earlier), earliest texts in Old Church Slavonic. Slavic languages include Bulgarian, Russian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Silesian, Kashubian, Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian (Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, Serbian), Sorbian, Slovenian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Rusyn.
** Baltic, attested from the 14th century; although attested relatively recently, they retain many archaic features attributed to Proto-Indo-European (PIE). Living examples are Lithuanian and Latvian.
* Celtic (from Proto-Celtic), attested since the 6th century BC; Lepontic inscriptions date as early as the 6th century BC; Celtiberian from the 2nd century BC; Primitive Irish Ogham inscriptions from the 4th or 5th century AD, earliest inscriptions in Old Welsh from the 7th century AD. Modern Celtic languages include Welsh, Cornish, Breton, Scottish Gaelic, Irish and Manx.
* Germanic (from Proto-Germanic), earliest attestations in runic inscriptions from around the 2nd century AD, earliest coherent texts in Gothic, 4th century AD. Old English manuscript tradition from about the 8th century AD. Includes English, Frisian, German, Dutch, Scots, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Afrikaans, Yiddish, Low German, Icelandic, Elfdalian, and Faroese.
* Hellenic (from Proto-Greek, see also History of Greek); fragmentary records in Mycenaean Greek from between 1450 and 1350 BC have been found. Homeric texts date to the 8th century BC.
* Indo-Iranian, attested , descended from Proto-Indo-Iranian (dated to the late 3rd millennium BC).
** Indo-Aryan, attested from around 1400 BC in Hittite texts from Anatolia, showing traces of Indo-Aryan words. Epigraphically from the 3rd century BC in the form of Prakrit (Edicts of Ashoka). The Rigveda is assumed to preserve intact records via oral tradition dating from about the mid-2nd millennium BC in the form of Vedic Sanskrit. Includes a wide range of modern languages from North India, Eastern Pakistan and Bangladesh, including Hindustani (Hindi, Urdu), Bengali, Odia, Assamese, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Gujarati, Marathi, Sindhi and Nepali, as well as Sinhala of Sri Lanka and Dhivehi of the Maldives and Minicoy.
** Iranian or Iranic, attested from roughly 1000 BC in the form of Avestan. Epigraphically from 520 BC in the form of Old Persian (Behistun inscription). Includes Persian, Pashto, Kurdish, Balochi, Luri, and Ossetian.
** Nuristani, attested since the 20th century, are among the newest Indo-European languages to be studied. Includes Katë, Prasun, Ashkun, Nuristani Kalasha, Tregami, and Zemiaki.
* Italic (from Proto-Italic), attested from the 7th century BC. Includes the ancient Osco-Umbrian languages, Faliscan, as well as Latin and its descendants, the Romance languages, such as Italian and French.
* Tocharian, with proposed links to the Afanasevo culture of Southern Siberia. Extant in two dialects (Turfanian and Kuchean, or Tocharian A and B), attested during roughly the 6th–9th centuries AD. Marginalized by the Old Turkic Uyghur Khaganate and probably extinct by the 10th century.

In addition to the classical ten branches listed above, several extinct and little-known languages and language-groups have existed or are proposed to have existed:
* Ancient Belgian: hypothetical language associated with the proposed Nordwestblock cultural area. Speculated to be connected to Italic or Venetic, and to have certain phonological features in common with Lusitanian.
* Cimmerian: possibly Iranic, Thracian, or Celtic
* Dacian: possibly very close to Thracian
* Elymian: Poorly-attested language spoken by the Elymians, one of the three indigenous (i.e. pre-Greek and pre-Punic) tribes of Sicily. Indo-European affiliation widely accepted, possibly related to Italic or Anatolian.
* Illyrian: possibly related to Albanian, Messapian, or both
* Liburnian: evidence too scant and uncertain to determine anything with certainty
* Ligurian: possibly close to or part of Celtic.
* Lusitanian: possibly related to (or part of) Celtic, Ligurian, or Italic
* Ancient Macedonian: proposed relationship to Greek.
* Messapic: not conclusively deciphered, often considered to be related to Albanian as the available fragmentary linguistic evidence shows common characteristic innovations and a number of significant lexical correspondences between the two languages
* Paionian: extinct language once spoken north of Macedon
* Phrygian: language of the ancient Phrygians. Very likely, but not certainly, a sister group to Hellenic.
* Sicel: an ancient language spoken by the Sicels (Greek Sikeloi, Latin Siculi), one of the three indigenous (i.e. pre-Greek and pre-Punic) tribes of Sicily. Proposed relationship to Latin or proto-Illyrian (Pre-Indo-European) at an earlier stage.
* Sorothaptic: proposed, pre-Celtic, Iberian language
* Thracian: possibly including Dacian
* Venetic: shares several similarities with Latin and the Italic languages, but also has some affinities with other IE languages, especially Germanic and Celtic.

Membership of languages in the Indo-European language family is determined by genealogical relationships, meaning that all members are presumed descendants of a common ancestor, Proto-Indo-European. Membership in the various branches, groups, and subgroups of Indo-European is also genealogical, but here the defining factors are &quot;shared innovations&quot; among various languages, suggesting a common ancestor that split off from other Indo-European groups. For example, what makes the Germanic languages a branch of Indo-European is that much of their structure and phonology can be stated in rules that apply to all of them. Many of their common features are presumed innovations that took place in Proto-Germanic, the source of all the Germanic languages.

In the 21st century, several attempts have been made to model the phylogeny of Indo-European languages using Bayesian methodologies similar to those applied to problems in biological phylogeny. Although there are differences in absolute timing between the various analyses, there is much commonality between them, including the result that the first known language groups to diverge were the Anatolian and Tocharian language families, in that order.

=== Tree versus wave model ===

The &quot;tree model&quot; is considered an appropriate representation of the genealogical history of a language family if communities do not remain in contact after their languages have started to diverge. In this case, subgroups defined by shared innovations form a nested pattern. The tree model is not appropriate in cases where languages remain in contact as they diversify; in such cases subgroups may overlap, and the &quot;wave model&quot; is a more accurate representation. Most approaches to Indo-European subgrouping to date have assumed that the tree model is by-and-large valid for Indo-European; however, there is also a long tradition of wave-model approaches.

In addition to genealogical changes, many of the early changes in Indo-European languages can be attributed to language contact. It has been asserted, for example, that many of the more striking features shared by Italic languages (Latin, Oscan, Umbrian, etc.) might well be areal features. More certainly, very similar-looking alterations in the systems of long vowels in the West Germanic languages greatly postdate any possible notion of a proto-language innovation (and cannot readily be regarded as &quot;areal&quot;, either, because English and continental West Germanic were not a linguistic area). In a similar vein, there are many similar innovations in Germanic and Balto-Slavic that are far more likely areal features than traceable to a common proto-language, such as the uniform development of a high vowel (*&quot;u&quot; in the case of Germanic, *&quot;i/u&quot; in the case of Baltic and Slavic) before the PIE syllabic resonants *&quot;ṛ, *ḷ, *ṃ, *ṇ&quot;, unique to these two groups among IE languages, which is in agreement with the wave model. The Balkan sprachbund even features areal convergence among members of very different branches.

An extension to the &quot;Ringe-Warnow model of language evolution&quot; suggests that early IE had featured limited contact between distinct lineages, with only the Germanic subfamily exhibiting a less treelike behaviour as it acquired some characteristics from neighbours early in its evolution. The internal diversification of especially West Germanic is cited to have been radically non-treelike.

=== Proposed subgroupings ===

Specialists have postulated the existence of higher-order subgroups such as Italo-Celtic, Graeco-Armenian, Graeco-Aryan or Graeco-Armeno-Aryan, and Balto-Slavo-Germanic. However, unlike the ten traditional branches, these are all controversial to a greater or lesser degree.

The Italo-Celtic subgroup was at one point uncontroversial, considered by Antoine Meillet to be even better established than Balto-Slavic. The main lines of evidence included the genitive suffix &quot;-ī&quot;; the superlative suffix &quot;-m̥mo&quot;; the change of /p/ to /kʷ/ before another /kʷ/ in the same word (as in &quot;penkʷe&quot; &gt; &quot;*kʷenkʷe&quot; &gt; Latin , Old Irish ); and the subjunctive morpheme &quot;-ā-&quot;. This evidence was prominently challenged by Calvert Watkins, while Michael Weiss has argued for the subgroup.

Evidence for a relationship between Greek and Armenian includes the regular change of the second laryngeal to &quot;a&quot; at the beginnings of words, as well as terms for &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;sheep&quot;. Greek and Indo-Iranian share innovations mainly in verbal morphology and patterns of nominal derivation. Relations have also been proposed between Phrygian and Greek, and between Thracian and Armenian. Some fundamental shared features, like the aorist (a verb form denoting action without reference to duration or completion) having the perfect active particle -s fixed to the stem, link this group closer to Anatolian languages and Tocharian. Shared features with Balto-Slavic languages, on the other hand (especially present and preterit formations), might be due to later contacts.

The Indo-Hittite hypothesis proposes that the Indo-European language family consists of two main branches: one represented by the Anatolian languages and another branch encompassing all other Indo-European languages. Features that separate Anatolian from all other branches of Indo-European (such as the gender or the verb system) have been interpreted alternately as archaic debris or as innovations due to prolonged isolation. Points proffered in favour of the Indo-Hittite hypothesis are the (non-universal) Indo-European agricultural terminology in Anatolia and the preservation of laryngeals. However, in general this hypothesis is considered to attribute too much weight to the Anatolian evidence. According to another view, the Anatolian subgroup left the Indo-European parent language comparatively late, approximately at the same time as Indo-Iranian and later than the Greek or Armenian divisions. A third view, especially prevalent in the so-called French school of Indo-European studies, holds that extant similarities in non-satem languages in general—including Anatolian—might be due to their peripheral location in the Indo-European language-area and to early separation, rather than indicating a special ancestral relationship. Hans J. Holm, based on lexical calculations, arrives at a picture roughly replicating the general scholarly opinion and refuting the Indo-Hittite hypothesis.

=== Satem and centum languages ===
The division of the Indo-European languages into satem and centum groups was put forward by Peter von Bradke in 1890, although Karl Brugmann did propose a similar type of division in 1886. In the satem languages, which include the Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian branches, as well as (in most respects) Albanian and Armenian, the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European palatovelars remained distinct and were fricativized, while the labiovelars merged with the &#x27;plain velars&#x27;. In the centum languages, the palatovelars merged with the plain velars, while the labiovelars remained distinct. The results of these alternative developments are exemplified by the words for &quot;hundred&quot; in Avestan () and Latin ()—the initial palatovelar developed into a fricative in the former, but became an ordinary velar in the latter.

Rather than being a genealogical separation, the centum–satem division is commonly seen as resulting from innovative changes that spread across PIE dialect-branches over a particular geographical area; the centum–satem isogloss intersects a number of other isoglosses that mark distinctions between features in the early IE branches. It may be that the centum branches in fact reflect the original state of affairs in PIE, and only the satem branches shared a set of innovations, which affected all but the peripheral areas of the PIE dialect continuum. Kortlandt proposes that the ancestors of Balts and Slavs took part in satemization before being drawn later into the western Indo-European sphere.

==Proposed external relations==

From the very beginning of Indo-European studies, there have been attempts to link the Indo-European languages genealogically to other languages and language families. However, these theories remain highly controversial, and most specialists in Indo-European linguistics are skeptical or agnostic about such proposals.

Proposals linking the Indo-European languages with a single language family include:
* Indo-Uralic, joining Indo-European with Uralic
* Pontic, postulated by John Colarusso, which joins Indo-European with Northwest Caucasian

Other proposed families include:
* Nostratic, comprising all or some of the Eurasiatic languages and the Kartvelian, Dravidian (or wider, Elamo-Dravidian) and Afroasiatic language families
* Eurasiatic, a theory championed by Joseph Greenberg, comprising the Uralic, Altaic and various &#x27;Paleosiberian&#x27; families (Ainu, Yukaghir, Nivkh, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, Eskimo–Aleut) and possibly others

Nostratic and Eurasiatic, in turn, have been included in even wider groupings, such as Borean, a language family separately proposed by Harold C. Fleming and Sergei Starostin that encompasses almost all of the world&#x27;s natural languages with the exception of those native to sub-Saharan Africa, New Guinea, Australia, and the Andaman Islands.

==Evolution==

===Proto-Indo-European===
The proposed Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) is the reconstructed common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, spoken by the Proto-Indo-Europeans. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became certain enough to establish its relationship to PIE. Using the method of internal reconstruction, an earlier stage, called Pre-Proto-Indo-European, has been proposed.

PIE is an inflected language, in which the grammatical relationships between words were signaled through inflectional morphemes (usually endings). The roots of PIE are basic morphemes carrying a lexical meaning. By addition of suffixes, they form stems, and by addition of endings, these form grammatically inflected words (nouns or verbs). The reconstructed Indo-European verb system is complex and, like the noun, exhibits a system of ablaut.

===Diversification===

The diversification of the parent language into the attested branches of daughter languages is historically unattested. The timeline of the evolution of the various daughter languages, on the other hand, is mostly undisputed, quite regardless of the question of Indo-European origins.

Using a mathematical analysis borrowed from evolutionary biology, Donald Ringe and Tandy Warnow propose the following evolutionary tree of Indo-European branches:
* Pre-Anatolian (before 3500 BC)
* Pre-Tocharian
* Pre-Italic and Pre-Celtic (before 2500 BC)
* Pre-Armenian and Pre-Greek (after 2500 BC)
* Proto-Indo-Iranian (2000 BC)
* Pre-Germanic and Pre-Balto-Slavic; proto-Germanic 

David Anthony proposes the following sequence:
* Pre-Anatolian (4200 BC)
* Pre-Tocharian (3700 BC)
* Pre-Germanic (3300 BC)
* Pre-Italic and Pre-Celtic (3000 BC)
* Pre-Armenian (2800 BC)
* Pre-Balto-Slavic (2800 BC)
* Pre-Greek (2500 BC)
* Proto-Indo-Iranian (2200 BC); split between Iranian and Old Indic 1800 BC

From 1500 BC the following sequence may be given:
* 1500–1000 BC: The Nordic Bronze Age of Scandinavia develops pre-Proto-Germanic, and the (pre-) Proto-Celtic Urnfield and Hallstatt cultures emerge in Central Europe, introducing the Iron Age. Migration of the Proto-Italic speakers into the Italian peninsula (Bagnolo stele). Migration of Aryans to India followed by the redaction of the Rigveda; rise of the Vedic civilization and beginning of Iron Age in the Punjab. The Mycenaean civilization gives way to the Greek Dark Ages. Hittite goes extinct. Iranian speakers start migrating southwards to Greater Iran. Balto-Slavic splits into ancestors of modern Baltic and Slavic.
* 1000–500 BC: The Celtic languages spread over Central and Western Europe, including Britain. Baltic languages are spoken in a huge area from present-day Poland to Moscow. Pre-Proto-Germanic gives rise to Proto-Germanic in southern Scandinavia. Homer and the beginning of Classical Antiquity. The Vedic civilization gives way to the Mahajanapadas as the Indo-Aryan tongue reaches eastwards, giving rise to the Greater Magadha cultural sphere, where Mahavira preaches Jainism and Siddhartha Gautama preaches Buddhism. Zoroaster composes the Gathas, rise of the Achaemenid Empire, replacing the Elamites and Babylonia. Separation of Proto-Italic into Osco-Umbrian, Latin-Faliscan, and possibly Venetic and Siculian. A variety of Paleo-Balkan languages besides Greek are spoken in Southern Europe, including Thracian, Dacian and Illyrian, and in Anatolia (Phrygian). Development of Prakrits across the northern Indian subcontinent, as well as migration of Indo-Aryan speakers to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
* 500 BC – 1 BC/AD: Classical Antiquity: spread of Greek and Latin throughout the Mediterranean and, during the Hellenistic period (Indo-Greeks), to Central Asia and the Hindukush. The Magadhan power and influence rises in ancient India, especially with the conquests of the Nandan and Mauryan empires. Germanic speakers start migrating southwards to occupy formerly Celtic territories. Scythian cultures extend from Eastern Europe (Pontic Scythians) to Northwest China (Ordos culture).
* 1 BC – AD 500: Late Antiquity, Gupta period; attestation of Armenian. Proto-Slavic. The Roman Empire and then the Germanic migrations marginalize the Celtic languages to the British Isles. Sogdian, an eastern Iranian language, becomes the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Silk Road in Central Asia leading to China, due to the proliferation of Sogdian merchants there. Greek settlements and Byzantine rule make the last Anatolian languages extinct. Turkic languages start replacing Scythian languages.
* 500–1000: Early Middle Ages. The Viking Age forms an Old Norse koine spanning Scandinavia, the British Isles and Iceland. Phrygian becomes extinct. The Islamic conquests and the Turkic expansion result in the Arabization and Turkification of significant areas where Indo-European languages were spoken, but Persian still develops under Islamic rule and extends into Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Due to further Turkic migrations, Tocharian becomes fully extinct while Scythian languages are overwhelmingly replaced. Slavic languages spread over wide areas in central, eastern and southeastern Europe, largely replacing Romance in the Balkans (with the exception of Romanian) and whatever was left of the Paleo-Balkan languages with the exception of Albanian. Pannonian Basin is taken by the Magyars from the western Slavs.
* 1000–1500: Late Middle Ages: Attestation of Albanian and Baltic. Modern dialects of Indo-European languages start emerging.
* 1500–2000: Early Modern period to present: Colonialism results in the spread of Indo-European languages to every habitable continent, most notably Romance (North, Central and South America, North and Sub-Saharan Africa, West Asia), West Germanic (English in North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and Australia; to a lesser extent Dutch and German), and Russian to Central Asia and North Asia.

===Important languages for reconstruction===
In reconstructing the history of the Indo-European languages and the form of the Proto-Indo-European language, some languages have been of particular importance. These generally include the ancient Indo-European languages that are both well-attested and documented at an early date, although some languages from later periods are important if they are particularly linguistically conservative (most notably, Lithuanian). Early poetry is of special significance because of the rigid poetic meter normally employed, which makes it possible to reconstruct a number of features (e.g. vowel length) that were either unwritten or corrupted in the process of transmission down to the earliest extant written manuscripts.

Most noticeable of all:
* Vedic Sanskrit (–500 BC). This language is unique in that its source documents were all composed orally, and were passed down through oral tradition (shakha schools) for c. 2,000 years before ever being written down. The oldest documents are all in poetic form; oldest and most important of all is the Rigveda ().
* Ancient Greek (–400 BC). Mycenaean Greek () is the oldest recorded form, but its value is lessened by the limited material, restricted subject matter, and highly ambiguous writing system. More important is Ancient Greek, documented extensively beginning with the two Homeric poems (the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, ).
* Hittite (–1200 BC). This is the earliest-recorded of all Indo-European languages, and highly divergent from the others due to the early separation of the Anatolian languages from the remainder. It possesses some highly archaic features found only fragmentarily, if at all, in other languages. At the same time, however, it appears to have undergone many early phonological and grammatical changes which, combined with the ambiguities of its writing system, hinder its usefulness somewhat.

Other primary sources:
* Latin, attested in a huge amount of poetic and prose material in the Classical period ( – AD 100) and limited older material from as early as .
* Gothic (the most archaic well-documented Germanic language, AD ), along with the combined witness of the other old Germanic languages: most importantly, Old English (–1000), Old High German (–1000) and Old Norse (–1300 AD, with limited earlier sources dating to AD ).
* Old Avestan (–1200 BC) and Younger Avestan (). Documentation is sparse, but nonetheless quite important due to its highly archaic nature.
* Modern Lithuanian, with limited records in Old Lithuanian (–1700).
* Old Church Slavonic (–1000).

Other secondary sources, of lesser value due to poor attestation:
* Luwian, Lycian, Lydian and other Anatolian languages (–400 BC).
* Oscan, Umbrian and other Old Italic languages (–200 BC).
* Old Persian ().
* Old Prussian (–1600); even more archaic than Lithuanian.

Other secondary sources, of lesser value due to extensive phonological changes and relatively limited attestation:
* Old Irish (AD–850).
* Tocharian (AD –800), underwent large phonetic shifts and mergers in the proto-language, and has an almost entirely reworked declension system.
* Classical Armenian (AD –1000).
* Albanian (–current time).

===Sound changes===

As the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language broke up, its sound system diverged as well, changing according to various sound laws evidenced in the daughter languages.

PIE is normally reconstructed with a complex system of 15 stop consonants, including an unusual three-way phonation (voicing) distinction between voiceless, voiced and &quot;voiced aspirated&quot; (i.e. breathy voiced) stops, and a three-way distinction among velar consonants (&quot;k&quot;-type sounds) between &quot;palatal&quot; &quot;ḱ ǵ ǵh&quot;, &quot;plain velar&quot; &quot;k g gh&quot; and labiovelar &quot;kʷ gʷ gʷh&quot;. (The correctness of the terms &quot;palatal&quot; and &quot;plain velar&quot; is disputed; see Proto-Indo-European phonology.) All daughter languages have reduced the number of distinctions among these sounds, often in divergent ways.

As an example, in English, one of the Germanic languages, the following are some of the major changes that happened:
None of the daughter-language families (except possibly Anatolian, particularly Luvian) reflect the plain velar stops differently from the other two series, and there is even a certain amount of dispute whether this series existed at all in PIE. The major distinction between &quot;centum&quot; and &quot;satem&quot; languages corresponds to the outcome of the PIE plain velars:
* The &quot;central&quot; &quot;satem&quot; languages (Indo-Iranian, Balto-Slavic, Albanian, and Armenian) reflect both &quot;plain velar&quot; and labiovelar stops as plain velars, often with secondary palatalization before a front vowel (&quot;e i ē ī&quot;). The &quot;palatal&quot; stops are palatalized and often appear as sibilants (usually but not always distinct from the secondarily palatalized stops).
* The &quot;peripheral&quot; &quot;centum&quot; languages (Germanic, Italic, Celtic, Greek, Anatolian and Tocharian) reflect both &quot;palatal&quot; and &quot;plain velar&quot; stops as plain velars, while the labiovelars continue unchanged, often with later reduction into plain labial or velar consonants.

The three-way PIE distinction between voiceless, voiced and voiced aspirated stops is considered extremely unusual from the perspective of linguistic typology—particularly in the existence of voiced aspirated stops without a corresponding series of voiceless aspirated stops. None of the various daughter-language families continue it unchanged, with numerous &quot;solutions&quot; to the apparently unstable PIE situation:
* The Indo-Aryan languages preserve the three series unchanged but have evolved a fourth series of voiceless aspirated consonants.
* The Iranian languages probably passed through the same stage, subsequently changing the aspirated stops into fricatives.
* Greek converted the voiced aspirates into voiceless aspirates.
* Italic probably passed through the same stage, but reflects the voiced aspirates as voiceless fricatives, especially &quot;f&quot; (or sometimes plain voiced stops in Latin).
* Celtic, Balto-Slavic, Anatolian, and Albanian merge the voiced aspirated into plain voiced stops.
* Germanic and Armenian change all three series in a chain shift (e.g. with &quot;bh b p&quot; becoming &quot;b p f&quot; (known as &quot;Grimm&#x27;s law&quot; in Germanic)).

Among the other notable changes affecting consonants are:
* The Ruki sound law (&quot;s&quot; becomes before &quot;r, u, k, i&quot;) in the &quot;satem&quot; languages.
* Loss of prevocalic &quot;p&quot; in Proto-Celtic.
* Development of prevocalic &quot;s&quot; to &quot;h&quot; in Proto-Greek, with later loss of &quot;h&quot; between vowels.
* Verner&#x27;s law in Proto-Germanic.
* Grassmann&#x27;s law (dissimilation of aspirates) independently in Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian.

The following table shows the basic outcomes of PIE consonants in some of the most important daughter languages for the purposes of reconstruction. For a fuller table, see Indo-European sound laws.

:Notes:
* C- At the beginning of a word.
* -C- Between vowels.
* -C At the end of a word.
* `-C- Following an unstressed vowel (Verner&#x27;s law).
* -C-(rl) Between vowels, or between a vowel and (on either side).
* CT Before a (PIE) stop ().
* CT− After a (PIE) obstruent (&#x27;, etc.; &#x27;).
* C(T) Before or after an obstruent (&#x27;, etc.; &#x27;).
* CH Before an original laryngeal.
* CE Before a (PIE) front vowel ().
* CE&#x27; Before secondary (post-PIE) front-vowels.

===Comparison of conjugations===

The following table presents a comparison of conjugations of the thematic present indicative of the verbal root * of the English verb &quot;&quot; and its reflexes in various early attested IE languages and their modern descendants or relatives, showing that all languages had in the early stage an inflectional verb system.


While similarities are still visible between the modern descendants and relatives of these ancient languages, the differences have increased over time. Some IE languages have moved from synthetic verb systems to largely periphrastic systems. In addition, the pronouns of periphrastic forms are in parentheses when they appear. Some of these verbs have undergone a change in meaning as well.
* In Modern Irish &quot;beir&quot; usually only carries the meaning &quot;to bear&quot; in the sense of bearing a child; its common meanings are &quot;to catch, grab&quot;. Apart from the first person, the forms given in the table above are dialectical or obsolete. The second and third person forms are typically instead conjugated periphrastically by adding a pronoun after the verb: &quot;beireann tú, beireann sé/sí, beireann sibh, beireann siad&quot;.
* The Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu) verb &quot;bʰarnā&quot;, the continuation of the Sanskrit verb, can have a variety of meanings, but the most common is &quot;to fill&quot;. The forms given in the table, although etymologically derived from the present indicative, now have the meaning of future subjunctive. The loss of the present indicative in Hindustani is roughly compensated by the periphrastic habitual indicative construction, using the habitual participle (etymologically from the Sanskrit present participle &quot;bʰarant-&quot;) and an auxiliary: &quot;ma͠i bʰartā hū̃, tū bʰartā hai, vah bʰartā hai, ham bʰarte ha͠i, tum bʰarte ho, ve bʰarte ha͠i&quot; (masculine forms).
* German is not directly descended from Gothic, but the Gothic forms are a close approximation of what the early West Germanic forms of would have looked like. The descendant of Proto-Germanic &quot;*beraną&quot; (English &quot;bear&quot;) survives in German only in the compound &quot;gebären&quot;, meaning &quot;bear (a child)&quot;.
* The Latin verb &quot;ferre&quot; is irregular, and not a good representative of a normal thematic verb. In most Romance languages such as Portuguese, other verbs now mean &quot;to carry&quot; (e.g. Pt. &quot;portar&quot; &lt; Lat. &quot;portare&quot;) and &quot;ferre&quot; was borrowed and nativized only in compounds such as &quot;to suffer&quot; (from Latin &quot;sub-&quot; and &quot;ferre&quot;) and &quot;to confer&quot; (from Latin &quot;con-&quot; and &quot;ferre&quot;).
* In Modern Greek, &quot;phero&quot; φέρω (modern transliteration &quot;fero&quot;) &quot;to bear&quot; is still used but only in specific contexts and is most common in such compounds as αναφέρω, διαφέρω, εισφέρω, εκφέρω, καταφέρω, προφέρω, προαναφέρω, προσφέρω etc. The form that is (very) common today is &quot;pherno&quot; φέρνω (modern transliteration &quot;ferno&quot;) meaning &quot;to bring&quot;. Additionally, the perfective form of &quot;pherno&quot; (used for the subjunctive voice and also for the future tense) is also &quot;phero&quot;.
* The dual forms are archaic in standard Lithuanian, and are only presently used in some dialects (e.g. Samogitian).
* Among modern Slavic languages, only Slovene continues to have a dual number in the standard variety.

==Present distribution==


Today, Indo-European languages are spoken by billions of native speakers across all inhabited continents, the largest number by far for any recognised language family. Of the 20 languages with the largest numbers of speakers according to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, 10 are Indo-European: English, Hindustani, Spanish, Bengali, French, Russian, Portuguese, German, Persian and Punjabi, each with 100 million speakers or more. Additionally, hundreds of millions of persons worldwide study Indo-European languages as secondary or tertiary languages, including in cultures which have completely different language families and historical backgrounds—there are around 600 million learners of English alone.

The success of the language family, including the large number of speakers and the vast portions of the Earth that they inhabit, is due to several factors. The ancient Indo-European migrations and widespread dissemination of Indo-European culture throughout Eurasia, including that of the Proto-Indo-Europeans themselves, and that of their daughter cultures including the Indo-Aryans, Iranian peoples, Celts, Greeks, Romans, Germanic peoples, and Slavs, led to these peoples&#x27; branches of the language family already taking a dominant foothold in virtually all of Eurasia except for swathes of the Near East, North and East Asia, replacing many (but not all) of the previously-spoken pre-Indo-European languages of this extensive area. However Semitic languages remain dominant in much of the Middle East and North Africa, and Caucasian languages in much of the Caucasus region. Similarly in Europe and the Urals the Uralic languages (such as Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian etc.) remain, as does Basque, a pre-Indo-European isolate.

Despite being unaware of their common linguistic origin, diverse groups of Indo-European speakers continued to culturally dominate and often replace the indigenous languages of the western two-thirds of Eurasia. By the beginning of the Common Era, Indo-European peoples controlled almost the entirety of this area: the Celts western and central Europe, the Romans southern Europe, the Germanic peoples northern Europe, the Slavs eastern Europe, the Iranian peoples most of western and central Asia and parts of eastern Europe, and the Indo-Aryan peoples in the Indian subcontinent, with the Tocharians inhabiting the Indo-European frontier in western China. By the medieval period, only the Semitic, Dravidian, Caucasian, and Uralic languages, and the language isolate Basque remained of the (relatively) indigenous languages of Europe and the western half of Asia.

Despite medieval invasions by Eurasian nomads, a group to which the Proto-Indo-Europeans had once belonged, Indo-European expansion reached another peak in the early modern period with the dramatic increase in the population of the Indian subcontinent and European expansionism throughout the globe during the Age of Discovery, as well as the continued replacement and assimilation of surrounding non-Indo-European languages and peoples due to increased state centralization and nationalism. These trends compounded throughout the modern period due to the general global population growth and the results of European colonization of the Western Hemisphere and Oceania, leading to an explosion in the number of Indo-European speakers as well as the territories inhabited by them.

Due to colonization and the modern dominance of Indo-European languages in the fields of politics, global science, technology, education, finance, and sports, even many modern countries whose populations largely speak non-Indo-European languages have Indo-European languages as official languages, and the majority of the global population speaks at least one Indo-European language. The overwhelming majority of languages used on the Internet are Indo-European, with English continuing to lead the group; English in general has in many respects become the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of global communication.
