<text>is a fantasy anthology media franchise created by Hironobu Sakaguchi which is owned, developed, and published by Square Enix (formerly Square). The franchise centers on a series of fantasy role-playing video games. The first game in the series was released in 1987, with 16 numbered main entries having been released to date.

The franchise has since branched into other video game genres such as tactical role-playing, action role-playing, massively multiplayer online role-playing, racing, third-person shooter, fighting, and rhythm, as well as branching into other media, including films, anime, manga, and novels.

&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; is mostly an anthology series with primary installments being stand-alone role-playing games, each with different settings, plots and main characters, but the franchise is linked by several recurring elements, including game mechanics and recurring character names. Each plot centers on a particular group of heroes who are battling a great evil, but also explores the characters&#x27; internal struggles and relationships. Character names are frequently derived from the history, languages, pop culture, and mythologies of cultures worldwide. The mechanics of each game involve similar battle systems and maps.

&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; has been both critically and commercially successful. Several entries are regarded as some of the greatest video games, with the series selling more than copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time. The series is well known for its innovation, visuals, such as the inclusion of full-motion videos and photorealistic character models, and music by Nobuo Uematsu. It has popularized many features now common in role-playing games, also popularizing the genre as a whole in markets outside Japan.

=== Games ===

The first installment of the series was released in Japan on December 18, 1987. Subsequent games are numbered and given a story unrelated to previous games, so the numbers refer to volumes rather than to sequels. Many &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games have been localized for markets in North America, Europe, and Australia on numerous video game consoles, personal computers (PC), and mobile phones. As of June 2023, the series includes the main installments from &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; to &quot;Final Fantasy XVI&quot;, as well as direct sequels and spin-offs, both released and confirmed as being in development. Most of the older games have been remade or re-released on multiple platforms.

==== Main series ====
Three &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; installments were released on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; was released in Japan in 1987 and in North America in 1990. It introduced many concepts to the console RPG genre, and has since been remade on several platforms. &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;, released in 1988 in Japan, has been bundled with &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; in several re-releases. The last of the NES installments, &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;, was released in Japan in 1990, but was not released elsewhere until a Nintendo DS remake came out in 2006.

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) also featured three installments of the main series, all of which have been re-released on several platforms. &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was released in 1991; in North America, it was released as &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;. It introduced the &quot;Active Time Battle&quot; system. &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, released in 1992 in Japan, was the first game in the series to spawn a sequel: a short anime series, &quot;Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was released in Japan in 1994, titled &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; in North America.

The PlayStation console saw the release of three main &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; (1997) moved away from the two-dimensional (2D) graphics used in the first six games to three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics; the game features polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds. It also introduced a more modern setting, a style that was carried over to the next game. It was also the second in the series to be released in Europe, with the first being &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was published in 1999, and was the first to consistently use realistically proportioned characters and feature a vocal piece as its theme music. &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, released in 2000, returned to the series&#x27; roots, by revisiting a more traditional &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; setting, rather than the more modern worlds of &quot;VII&quot; and &quot;VIII&quot;.

Three main installments, as well as one online game, were published for the PlayStation 2. &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; (2001) introduced full 3D areas and voice acting to the series, and was the first to spawn a sub-sequel (&quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;, published in 2003). The first massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) in the series, &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, was released on the PS2 and PC in 2002, and later on the Xbox 360. It introduced real-time battles instead of random encounters. &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;, published in 2006, also includes real-time battles in large, interconnected playfields. The game is also the first in the main series to utilize a world used in a previous game, namely the land of Ivalice, which was previously featured in &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; was released in Japan, and in North America and Europe the following year, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is the flagship installment of the &quot;Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy&quot; series and became the first mainline game to spawn two sub-sequels (&quot;XIII-2&quot; and &quot;Lightning Returns&quot;). It was also the first game released in Chinese and high definition along with being released on two consoles at once. &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, a MMORPG, was released worldwide on Microsoft Windows in 2010, but it received heavy criticism when it was launched, prompting Square Enix to rerelease the game as &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn&quot;, this time to the PlayStation 3 as well, in 2013. &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; is an action role-playing game that was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2016. Originally a &quot;XIII&quot; spin-off titled &quot;Versus XIII&quot;, &quot;XV&quot; uses the mythos of the &quot;Fabula Nova Crystallis&quot; series, although in many other respects the game stands on its own and has since been distanced from the series by its developers. The sixteenth mainline entry, &quot;Final Fantasy XVI&quot;, was released in 2023 for PlayStation 5.

==== Remakes, sequels and spin-offs ====

&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; has spawned numerous spin-offs and metaseries. Several are, in fact, not &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, but were rebranded for North American release. Examples include the &quot;SaGa&quot; series, rebranded &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot;, and its two sequels, &quot;Final Fantasy Legend II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot; was specifically developed for a United States audience, and &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; is a tactical RPG that features many references and themes found in the series. The spin-off &quot;Chocobo&quot; series, &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; series, and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series also include multiple &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; elements. In 2003, the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series&#x27; first sub-sequel, &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;, was released. &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; was originally intended to stand on its own, but the team wanted to explore the world, characters and mythos more, resulting in the development and release of two sequels in 2011 and 2013 respectively, creating the series&#x27; first official trilogy. &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; was released in 2009, a fighting game that features heroes and villains from the first ten games of the main series. It was followed by a prequel in 2011, a sequel in 2015 and a mobile spin-off in 2017. Other spin-offs have taken the form of subseries—&quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;Ivalice Alliance&quot;, and &quot;Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy&quot;. In 2022, Square Enix released an action-role playing title &quot;Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin&quot; developed in collaboration with Team Ninja, which takes place in an alternate, reimagined reality based on the setting of the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game, depicting a prequel story that explores the origins of the antagonist Chaos and the emergence of the four Warriors of Light. Enhanced 3D remakes of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot; were released in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The first installment of the &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; project was released on the PlayStation 4 in 2020. The second and latest installment of the remake trilogy, &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;, was released on the PlayStation 5 in 2024.

=== Other media ===
====Film and television====

Square Enix has expanded the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series into various media. Multiple anime and computer-generated imagery (CGI) films have been produced that are based either on individual &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games or on the series as a whole. The first was an original video animation (OVA), &quot;Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;. The story was set in the same world as the game, although 200 years in the future. It was released as four 30-minute episodes, first in Japan in 1994 and later in the United States by Urban Vision in 1998. In 2001, Square Pictures released its first feature film, &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;. The film is set on a future Earth invaded by alien life forms. &quot;The Spirits Within&quot; was the first animated feature to seriously attempt to portray photorealistic CGI humans, but was considered a box office bomb and garnered mixed reviews.

A 25-episode anime television series, &quot;Final Fantasy: Unlimited&quot;, was released in 2001 based on the common elements of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. It was broadcast in Japan by TV Tokyo and released in North America by ADV Films.

In 2005, &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot;, a feature length direct-to-DVD CGI film, and &quot;Last Order: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, a non-canon OVA, were released as part of the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;. &quot;Advent Children&quot; was animated by Visual Works, which helped the company create CG sequences for the games. The film, unlike &quot;The Spirits Within&quot;, became a commercial success. &quot;Last Order&quot;, on the other hand, was released in Japan in a special DVD bundle package with &quot;Advent Children&quot;. &quot;Last Order&quot; sold out quickly and was positively received by Western critics, though fan reaction was mixed over changes to established story scenes.

Two animated tie-ins for &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; were released as part of a larger multimedia project dubbed the &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; Universe. &quot;&quot; is a series of five 10-to-20-minute-long episodes developed by A-1 Pictures and Square Enix detailing the backstories of the main cast. &quot;&quot;, a CGI film released prior to the game in Summer 2016, is set during the game&#x27;s opening and follows new and secondary characters. In 2019, Square Enix released a short anime, produced by Satelight Inc, called &quot;Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn – Prologue&quot; on their YouTube channel which acts as the background story for the final piece of DLC for &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; giving insight into Ardyn&#x27;s past.

Square Enix also released &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: Dad of Light&quot; in 2017, an 8-episode Japanese soap opera based, featuring a mix of live-action scenes and &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; gameplay footage.

As of June 2019, Sony Pictures Television is working on a live-action adaptation of the series with Hivemind and Square Enix. Jason F. Brown, Sean Daniel and Dinesh Shamdasani for Hivemind are the producers while Ben Lustig and Jake Thornton were attached as writers and executive producers for the series.

====Other media====
Several video games in the series have either been adapted into or have had spin-offs in the form of manga and novels. The first was the novelization of &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; in 1989, which was followed by a manga adaptation of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; in 1992. Later years have seen an increase in the number of non-video game adaptations and spin-offs. &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; has been adapted into a novel, the spin-off game &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot; has been adapted into a manga, and &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; had a novel and manga set in its continuity. Seven novellas based on the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; universe have also been released. The &quot;Final Fantasy: Unlimited&quot; story was partially continued in novels and a manga after the anime series ended. The &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;XIII&quot; series have also had novellas and audio dramas released. &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; has been adapted into a radio drama, and &quot;Final Fantasy: Unlimited&quot; has received a radio drama sequel.

A trading card game named &quot;Final Fantasy Trading Card Game&quot; is produced by Square Enix and Hobby Japan, first released Japan in 2012 with an English version in 2016. The game has been compared to &quot;&quot;, and a tournament circuit for the game also takes place.

== Common elements ==

Although most &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; installments are independent, many gameplay elements recur throughout the series. Most games contain elements of fantasy and science fiction and feature recycled names often inspired from various cultures&#x27; history, languages and mythology, including Asian, European, and Middle-Eastern. Examples include weapon names like Excalibur and Masamune—derived from Arthurian legend and the Japanese swordsmith Masamune respectively—as well as the spell names Holy, Meteor, and Ultima. Beginning with &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, the main series adopted its current logo style that features the same typeface and an emblem designed by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano. The emblem relates to a game&#x27;s plot and typically portrays a character or object in the story. Subsequent remakes of the first three games have replaced the previous logos with ones similar to the rest of the series.

=== Plot and themes ===
The central conflict in many &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games focuses on a group of characters battling an evil, and sometimes ancient, antagonist that dominates the game&#x27;s world. Stories frequently involve a sovereign state in rebellion, with the protagonists taking part in the rebellion. The heroes are often destined to defeat the evil, and occasionally gather as a direct result of the antagonist&#x27;s malicious actions. Another staple of the series is the existence of two villains; the main villain is not always who it appears to be, as the primary antagonist may actually be subservient to another character or entity. The main antagonist introduced at the beginning of the game is not always the final enemy, and the characters must continue their quest beyond what appears to be the final fight.

Stories in the series frequently emphasize the internal struggles, passions, and tragedies of the characters, and the main plot often recedes into the background as the focus shifts to their personal lives. Games also explore relationships between characters, ranging from love to rivalry. Other recurring situations that drive the plot include amnesia, a hero corrupted by an evil force, mistaken identity, and self-sacrifice. Magical orbs and crystals are recurring in-game items that are frequently connected to the themes of the games&#x27; plots. Crystals often play a central role in the creation of the world, and a majority of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games link crystals and orbs to the planet&#x27;s life force. As such, control over these crystals drives the main conflict. The classical elements are also a recurring theme in the series related to the heroes, villains, and items. Other common plot and setting themes include the Gaia hypothesis, an apocalypse, and conflicts between advanced technology and nature.

=== Characters ===

The series features a number of recurring character archetypes. Most famously, every game since &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;, including subsequent remakes of the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, features a character named Cid. Cid&#x27;s appearance, personality, goals, and role in the game (non-playable ally, party member, villain) vary dramatically, but two characteristics many versions of Cid have in common are being a scientist or engineer, and being tied in some way to an airship the party eventually acquires. Every Cid has at least one of these two traits.

Biggs and Wedge, inspired by two &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters of the same name, appear in numerous games as minor characters, sometimes as comic relief. The later games in the series feature several males with effeminate characteristics. Recurring creatures include Chocobos, Moogles, and Cactuars. Chocobos are large, often flightless birds that appear in several installments as a means of long-distance travel for characters. Moogles are white, stout creatures resembling teddy bears with wings and a single antenna. They serve different roles in games including mail delivery, weaponsmiths, party members, and saving the game. Cactuars are anthropomorphic cacti with &quot;haniwa&quot;-like faces presented in a running or dashing pose. They usually appear as recurring enemy units, and also as summoned allies or friendly non-player characters in certain titles. Chocobo and Moogle appearances are often accompanied by specific musical themes that have been arranged differently for separate games.

=== Gameplay ===

In &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, players command a party of characters as they progress through the game&#x27;s story by exploring the game world and defeating enemies. Enemies are typically encountered randomly through exploring, a trend which changed in &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; and &quot;XII&quot;. The player issues combat orders—like &quot;Fight&quot;, &quot;Magic&quot;, and &quot;Item&quot;—to individual characters via a menu-driven interface while engaging in battles. Throughout the series, the games have used different battle systems. Prior to &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, battles were turn-based with the protagonists and antagonists on different sides of the battlefield. &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; introduced the &quot;Active Time Battle&quot; (ATB) system that augmented the turn-based nature with a perpetual time-keeping system. Designed by Hiroyuki Ito, it injected urgency and excitement into combat by requiring the player to act before an enemy attacks, and was used until &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, which implemented the &quot;Conditional Turn-Based&quot; (CTB) system. This new system returned to the previous turn-based system, but added nuances to offer players more challenge. &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; adopted a real-time battle system where characters continuously act depending on the issued command. &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; continued this gameplay with the &quot;Active Dimension Battle&quot; system. &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;″s combat system, designed by the same man who worked on &quot;X&quot;, was meant to have an action-oriented feel, emulating the cinematic battles in &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; introduces a new &quot;Open Combat&quot; system. Unlike previous battle systems in the franchise, the &quot;Open Combat&quot; system (OCS) allows players to take on a fully active battle scenario, allowing for free range attacks and movement, giving a much more fluid feel of combat. This system also incorporates a &quot;Tactical&quot; Option during battle, which pauses active battle to allow use of items.

Like most RPGs, the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; installments use an experience level system for character advancement, in which experience points are accumulated by killing enemies. Character classes, specific jobs that enable unique abilities for characters, are another recurring theme. Introduced in the first game, character classes have been used differently in each game. Some restrict a character to a single job to integrate it into the story, while other games feature dynamic job systems that allow the player to choose from multiple classes and switch throughout the game. Though used heavily in many games, such systems have become less prevalent in favor of characters that are more versatile; characters still match an archetype, but are able to learn skills outside their class.

Magic is another common RPG element in the series. The method by which characters gain magic varies between installments, but is generally divided into classes organized by color: &quot;White magic&quot;, which focuses on spells that assist teammates; &quot;Black magic&quot;, which focuses on harming enemies; &quot;Red magic&quot;, which is a combination of white and black magic, &quot;Blue magic&quot;, which mimics enemy attacks; and &quot;Green magic&quot; which focuses on applying status effects to either allies or enemies. Other types of magic frequently appear such as &quot;Time magic&quot;, focusing on the themes of time, space, and gravity; and &quot;Summoning magic&quot;, which evokes legendary creatures to aid in battle and is a feature that has persisted since &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;. Summoned creatures are often referred to by names like &quot;Espers&quot; or &quot;Eidolons&quot; and have been inspired by mythologies from Arabic, Hindu, Norse, and Greek cultures.

Different means of transportation have appeared through the series. The most common is the airship for long range travel, accompanied by chocobos for travelling short distances, but others include sea and land vessels. Following &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, more modern and futuristic vehicle designs have been included.

== Development and history ==
=== Origin ===
In the mid-1980s, Square entered the Japanese video game industry with simple RPGs, racing games, and platformers for Nintendo&#x27;s Famicom Disk System. In 1987, Square designer Hironobu Sakaguchi chose to create a new fantasy role-playing game for the cartridge-based NES, and drew inspiration from popular fantasy games: Enix&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, and Origin Systems&#x27;s &quot;Ultima&quot; series. Though often attributed to the company allegedly facing bankruptcy, Sakaguchi explained that the game was his personal last-ditch effort in the game industry and that its title, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, stemmed from his feelings at the time; had the game not sold well, he would have quit the business and gone back to college. Despite his explanation, publications have also attributed the name to the company&#x27;s hopes that the project would solve its financial troubles. In 2015, Sakaguchi explained the name&#x27;s origin: the team wanted a title that would abbreviate to &quot;FF&quot;, which would sound good in Japanese. The name was originally going to be &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot;, but due to concerns over trademark conflicts with the roleplaying gamebook series of the same name, they needed to settle for something else. As the English word &quot;Final&quot; was well known in Japan, Sakaguchi settled on that. According to Sakaguchi, any title that created the &quot;FF&quot; abbreviation would have done.

The game indeed reversed Square&#x27;s lagging fortunes, and it became the company&#x27;s flagship franchise. Following the success, Square immediately developed a second installment. Because Sakaguchi assumed &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; would be a stand-alone game, its story was not designed to be expanded by a sequel. The developers instead chose to carry over only thematic similarities from its predecessor, while some of the gameplay elements, such as the character advancement system, were overhauled. This approach has continued throughout the series; each major &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game features a new setting, a new cast of characters, and an upgraded battle system. Video game writer John Harris attributed the concept of reworking the game system of each installment to Nihon Falcom&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; series, with which Square was previously involved as a publisher. The company regularly released new games in the main series, but the time between the releases of &quot;XI&quot; (2002), &quot;XII&quot; (2006), and &quot;XIII&quot; (2009) were much longer than previous games. Following &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, Square Enix released &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games either annually or biennially. This switch was to mimic the development cycles of Western games in the &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; and &quot;Battlefield&quot; series, as well as maintain fan-interest.

=== Design ===

For the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, Sakaguchi required a larger production team than Square&#x27;s previous games. He began crafting the game&#x27;s story while experimenting with gameplay ideas. Once the gameplay system and game world size were established, Sakaguchi integrated his story ideas into the available resources. A different approach has been taken for subsequent games; the story is completed first and the game built around it. Designers have never been restricted by consistency, though most feel each game should have a minimum number of common elements. The development teams strive to create completely new worlds for each game, and avoid making new games too similar to previous ones. Game locations are conceptualized early in development and design details like building parts are fleshed out as a base for entire structures.

The first five games were directed by Sakaguchi, who also provided the original concepts. He drew inspiration for game elements from anime films by Hayao Miyazaki; series staples like the airships and chocobos are inspired by elements in &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, respectively. Sakaguchi served as a producer for subsequent games until he left Square in 2001. Yoshinori Kitase took over directing the games until &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, and has been followed by a new director for each new game. Hiroyuki Ito designed several gameplay systems, including &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;″s &quot;Job System&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;″s &quot;Junction System&quot; and the Active Time Battle concept, which was used from &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; until &quot;IX&quot;. In designing the Active Time Battle system, Ito drew inspiration from Formula One racing; he thought it would be interesting if character types had different speeds after watching race cars pass each other. Ito also co-directed &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; with Kitase. Kenji Terada was the scenario writer for the first three games; Kitase took over as scenario writer for &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; through &quot;VII&quot;. Kazushige Nojima became the series&#x27; primary scenario writer from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; until his resignation in October 2003; he has since formed his own company, Stellavista. Nojima partially or completely wrote the stories for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;VIII&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, and its sequel &quot;X-2&quot;. He also worked as the scenario writer for the spin-off series, &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. Daisuke Watanabe co-wrote the scenarios for &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;XII&quot;, and was the main writer for the &quot;XIII&quot; games.

Artistic design, including character and monster creations, was handled by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; through &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. Amano also handled title logo designs for all of the main series and the image illustrations from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; onward. Tetsuya Nomura was chosen to replace Amano because Nomura&#x27;s designs were more adaptable to 3D graphics. He worked with the series from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; through &quot;X&quot;, then came back for &quot;XIII&quot;, and for the basic design of &quot;XV&quot;. For &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; character designs were handled by Shukō Murase, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Shin Nagasawa. For &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;, Roberto Ferrari was responsible for the character design. Nomura is also the character designer of the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and &quot;Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy&quot;. Other designers include Nobuyoshi Mihara and Akihiko Yoshida. Mihara was the character designer for &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, and Yoshida served as character designer for &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, the Square-produced &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;.

=== Graphics and technology ===
Because of graphical limitations, the first games on the NES feature small sprite representations of the leading party members on the main world screen. Battle screens use more detailed, full versions of characters in a side-view perspective. This practice was used until &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, which uses detailed versions for both screens. The NES sprites are 26 pixels high and use a color palette of 4 colors. 6 frames of animation are used to depict different character statuses like &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;fatigued&quot;. The SNES installments use updated graphics and effects, as well as higher quality audio than in previous games, but are otherwise similar to their predecessors in basic design. The SNES sprites are 2 pixels shorter, but have larger palettes and feature more animation frames: 11 colors and 40 frames respectively. The upgrade allowed designers to have characters be more detailed in appearance and express more emotions. The first game includes non-player characters (NPCs) the player could interact with, but they are mostly static in-game objects. Beginning with the second game, Square used predetermined pathways for NPCs to create more dynamic scenes that include comedy and drama.

In 1995, Square showed an interactive SGI technical demonstration of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; for the then next generation of consoles. The demonstration used Silicon Graphics&#x27;s prototype Nintendo 64 workstations to create 3D graphics. Fans believed the demo was of a new &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game for the Nintendo 64 console. 1997 saw the release of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; for the Sony PlayStation. The switch was due to a dispute with Nintendo over its use of faster but more expensive cartridges, as opposed to the slower and cheaper, but much higher capacity compact discs used on rival systems. &quot;VII&quot; introduced 3D graphics with fully pre-rendered backgrounds. It was because of this switch to 3D that a CD-ROM format was chosen over a cartridge format. The switch also led to increased production costs and a greater subdivision of the creative staff for &quot;VII&quot; and subsequent 3D games in the series.

Starting with &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, the series adopted a more photo-realistic look. Like &quot;VII&quot;, full motion video (FMV) sequences would have video playing in the background, with the polygonal characters composited on top. &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; returned to the more stylized design of earlier games in the series, although it still maintained, and in many cases slightly upgraded, most of the graphical techniques used in the previous two games. &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; was released on the PlayStation 2, and used the more powerful hardware to render graphics in real-time instead of using pre-rendered material to obtain a more dynamic look; the game features full 3D environments, rather than having 3D character models move about pre-rendered backgrounds. It is also the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game to feature voice acting, occurring throughout the majority of the game, even with many minor characters. This aspect added a whole new dimension of depth to the character&#x27;s reactions, emotions, and development.

Taking a temporary divergence, &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; used the PlayStation 2&#x27;s online capabilities as an MMORPG. Initially released for the PlayStation 2 with a PC port arriving six months later, &quot;XI&quot; was also released on the Xbox 360 nearly four years after its original release in Japan. This was the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game to use a free rotating camera. &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; was released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2 and uses only half as many polygons as &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, in exchange for more advanced textures and lighting. It also retains the freely rotating camera from &quot;XI&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; and &quot;XIV&quot; both make use of Crystal Tools, a middleware engine developed by Square Enix.

=== Music ===
&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games feature a variety of music, and frequently reuse themes. Most of the games open with a piece called &quot;Prelude&quot;, which has evolved from a simple, 2-voice arpeggio in the early games to a complex, melodic arrangement in recent installments. Victories in combat are often accompanied by a victory fanfare, a theme that has become one of the most recognized pieces of music in the series. The basic theme that accompanies Chocobo appearances has been rearranged in a different musical style for most installments. Recurring secret bosses such as Gilgamesh are also used as opportunities to revive their musical themes.

A theme known as the &quot;Final Fantasy Main Theme&quot; or &quot;March&quot;, originally featured in the first game, often accompanies the ending credits. Although leitmotifs are common in the more character-driven installments, theme music is typically reserved for main characters and recurring plot elements.

Nobuo Uematsu was the primary composer of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series until his resignation from Square Enix in November 2004. Other notable composers who have worked on main entries in the series include Masashi Hamauzu, Hitoshi Sakimoto, and Yoko Shimomura. Uematsu was allowed to create much of the music with little direction from the production staff. Sakaguchi, however, would request pieces to fit specific game scenes including battles and exploring different areas of the game world. Once a game&#x27;s major scenarios were completed, Uematsu would begin writing the music based on the story, characters, and accompanying artwork. He started with a game&#x27;s main theme, and developed other pieces to match its style. In creating character themes, Uematsu read the game&#x27;s scenario to determine the characters&#x27; personality. He would also ask the scenario writer for more details to scenes he was unsure about. Technical limitations were prevalent in earlier games; Sakaguchi would sometimes instruct Uematsu to only use specific notes. It was not until &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; on the SNES that Uematsu was able to add more subtlety to the music.

== Reception ==
Overall, the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series has been critically acclaimed and commercially successful, though each installment has seen different levels of success. The series has seen a steady increase in total sales; it sold units by 1999, and reached units in 2011. By June 2023, the series reached cumulative global physical and digital sales of 185 million units.

Several games within the series have become best-selling games. At the end of 2007, the seventh, eighth, and ninth best-selling RPGs were &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;VIII&quot;, and &quot;X&quot; respectively. The original &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; has sold over 14.4 million copies worldwide, earning it the position of the best-selling &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game. Within two days of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;″s North American release on September 9, 1999, it became the top-selling video game in the United States, a position it held for more than three weeks. &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; sold over 1.4 million Japanese units in pre-orders alone, which set a record for the fastest-selling console RPG. The MMORPG, &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, reached over 200,000 active daily players in March 2006 and had reached over half a million subscribers by July 2007. &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; sold more than 1.7 million copies in its first week in Japan. By November 6, 2006—one week after its release—&quot;XII&quot; had shipped approximately 1.5 million copies in North America. &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; became the fastest-selling game in the franchise, and sold one million units on its first day of sale in Japan. &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn&quot;, in comparison to its predecessor, was a runaway success, originally suffering from servers being overcrowded, and eventually gaining over one million unique subscribers within two months of its launch.

The series has received critical acclaim for the quality of its visuals and soundtracks. In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked the series collectively as the 17th best game of all time, speaking very highly of its graphics, music and stories. In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series as number 16 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that &quot;by pairing state-of-the-art technology with memorable, sometimes shamelessly melodramatic storylines, the series has successfully outlasted its competitors [...] and improved with each new installation&quot;. It was awarded a star on the Walk of Game in 2006, making it the first franchise to win a star on the event (other winners were individual games, not franchises). WalkOfGame.com commented that the series has sought perfection as well as having been a risk taker in innovation. In 2006, GameFAQs held a contest for the best video game series ever, with &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; finishing as the runner-up to &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. In a 2008 public poll held by The Game Group plc, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; was voted the best game series, with five games appearing in their &quot;Greatest Games of All Time&quot; list.

Many &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games have been included in various lists of top games. Several games have been listed on multiple IGN &quot;Top Games&quot; lists. Twelve games were listed on &quot;Famitsu&quot; 2006 &quot;Top 100 Favorite Games of All Time&quot;, four of which were in the top ten, with &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;VII&quot; coming first and second, respectively. The series holds seven Guinness World Records in the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008&quot;, which include the &quot;Most Games in an RPG Series&quot; (13 main games, seven enhanced games, and 32 spin-off games), the &quot;Longest Development Period&quot; (the production of &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; took five years), and the &quot;Fastest-Selling Console RPG in a Single Day&quot; (&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;). The 2009 edition listed two games from the series among the top 50 consoles games: &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; at number 8 and &quot;VII&quot; at number 20. In 2018, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was inducted as a member of the World Video Game Hall of Fame.

However, the series has garnered some criticism. &quot;IGN&quot; has commented that the menu system used by the games is a major detractor for many and is a &quot;significant reason why they haven&#x27;t touched the series&quot;. The site has also heavily criticized the use of random encounters in the series&#x27; battle systems. &quot;IGN&quot; further stated that the various attempts to bring the series into film and animation have either been unsuccessful, unremarkable, or did not live up to the standards of the games. In 2007, &quot;Edge&quot; criticized the series for a number of related games that include the phrase &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; in their titles, which are considered inferior to previous games. It also commented that with the departure of Hironobu Sakaguchi, the series might be in danger of growing stale.

Several individual &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games have garnered extra attention; some for their positive reception and others for their negative reception. &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; topped &quot;GamePro&#x27;s&quot; &quot;26 Best RPGs of All Time&quot; list, as well as GameFAQs &quot;Best Game Ever&quot; audience polls in 2004 and 2005. Despite the success of &quot;VII&quot;, it is sometimes criticized as being overrated. In 2003, GameSpy listed it as the seventh most overrated game of all time, while IGN presented views from both sides. &quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot; shipped 392,000 units in its first week of release, but received review scores that were much lower than that of other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. A delayed, negative review after the Japanese release of &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; from Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; hinted at a controversy between the magazine and Square Enix. Though &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; was praised for its visuals, the plot was criticized and the film was considered a box office bomb. &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot; for the GameCube received overall positive review scores, but reviews stated that the use of Game Boy Advances as controllers was a big detractor. The predominantly negative reception of the original version of &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; caused then-president Yoichi Wada to issue an official apology during a Tokyo press conference, stating that the brand had been &quot;greatly damaged&quot; by the game&#x27;s reception.

===Rankings and aggregators===
Various video game publications have created rankings of the mainline &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. In the table below, the lower the number given, the better the game is in the view of the respective publication. By way of comparison, the ratings provided by &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine and the review aggregator &quot;Metacritic&quot; are also given; in these rows, higher numbers indicate better reviews. Note that &quot;Metacritic&quot; ratings up until &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; largely represent retrospective reviews from online websites years after their initial release, rather than contemporary reviews from video game magazines at the time of their initial release.


== Legacy ==
&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; has been influential in the history of video games and game mechanics. &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; is considered a milestone for the genre, introducing a dramatic storyline with a strong emphasis on character development and personal relationships. In 1992, Nintendo&#x27;s Shigeru Miyamoto noted the impact of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; on Japanese role-playing games, stating &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;″s &quot;interactive cinematic approach&quot; with an emphasis on &quot;presentation and graphics&quot; was gradually becoming &quot;the most common style&quot; of Japanese RPG at the time. &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, having been the first title of the series to be officially released in the PAL territories of Europe and Oceania, is credited as having the largest industry impact of the series, and with allowing console role-playing games to gain global mass-market appeal. &quot;VII&quot; is considered to be one of the most important and influential video games in the series.

The series affected Square&#x27;s business on several levels. The commercial failure of &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; resulted in hesitation and delays from Enix during merger discussions with Square. Square&#x27;s decision to produce games exclusively for the Sony PlayStation—a move followed by Enix&#x27;s decision with the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series—severed their relationship with Nintendo. &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games were absent from Nintendo consoles, specifically the Nintendo 64, for seven years. Critics attribute the switch of strong third-party games like the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation, and away from the Nintendo 64, as one of the reasons behind PlayStation being the more successful of the two consoles. The release of the Nintendo GameCube, which used optical disc media, in 2001 caught the attention of Square. To produce games for the system, Square created the shell company The Game Designers Studio and released &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot;, which spawned its own metaseries within the main franchise. &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;″s lack of an online method of subscription cancellation prompted the creation of legislation in Illinois that requires internet gaming services to provide such a method to the state&#x27;s residents.

The series&#x27; popularity has resulted in its appearance and reference in numerous facets of popular culture like anime, TV series, and webcomics. Music from the series has permeated into different areas of culture. &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;″s &quot;Theme of Love&quot; was integrated into the curriculum of Japanese school children and has been performed live by orchestras and metal bands. In 2003, Uematsu co-founded The Black Mages, an instrumental rock group independent of Square that has released albums of arranged &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; tunes. Bronze medalists Alison Bartosik and Anna Kozlova performed their synchronized swimming routine at the 2004 Summer Olympics to music from &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. Many of the soundtracks have also been released for sale. Numerous companion books, which normally provide in-depth game information, have been published. In Japan, they are published by Square and are called &quot;Ultimania&quot; books.

The series has inspired numerous game developers. &quot;Fable&quot; creator Peter Molyneux considers &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; to be the RPG that &quot;defined the genre&quot; for him. BioWare founder Greg Zeschuk cited &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; as &quot;the first really emotionally engaging game&quot; he played and said it had &quot;a big impact&quot; on BioWare&#x27;s work. &quot;The Witcher 3&quot; senior environmental artist Jonas Mattsson cited &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; as &quot;a huge influence&quot; and said it was &quot;the first RPG&quot; he played through. &quot;Mass Effect&quot; art director Derek Watts cited &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; as a major influence on the visual design and art direction of the series. BioWare senior product manager David Silverman cited &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;″s gambit system as an influence on the gameplay of &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot;. Ubisoft Toronto creative director Maxime Beland cited the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; as a major influence on him. Media Molecule&#x27;s Constantin Jupp credited &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; with getting him into game design. Tim Schafer also cited &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; as one of his favourite games.

The &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; fandom includes large fan organizations like Final Fantasy Union. In 2023, Final Fantasy Union collaborated with British indie publisher Lost in Cult on the sixth volume of the imprint&#x27;s art journal, &quot;Lock-On&quot;, which focused on the art of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; and featured an exclusive cover illustration of Terra Branford by Yoshitaka Amano alongside interviews with Hironobu Sakaguchi, Nobuo Uematsu, and Matt Mercer.

In October 2007, a fan-made web series of CG action films called &quot;Dead Fantasy&quot; was created by late web-based animator and writer, Monty Oum. &quot;Dead Fantasy&quot; featured &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters competing against &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; characters in battle royale-style brawls.

<text>In chemistry, particularly in biochemistry, a fatty acid is a carboxylic acid with an aliphatic chain, which is either saturated or unsaturated. Most naturally occurring fatty acids have an unbranched chain of an even number of carbon atoms, from 4 to 28. Fatty acids are a major component of the lipids (up to 70% by weight) in some species such as microalgae but in some other organisms are not found in their standalone form, but instead exist as three main classes of esters: triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesteryl esters. In any of these forms, fatty acids are both important dietary sources of fuel for animals and important structural components for cells.

==History==
The concept of fatty acid (&quot;acide gras&quot;) was introduced in 1813 by Michel Eugène Chevreul, though he initially used some variant terms: &quot;graisse acide&quot; and &quot;acide huileux&quot; (&quot;acid fat&quot; and &quot;oily acid&quot;).

==Types of fatty acids==

Fatty acids are classified in many ways: by length, by saturation vs unsaturation, by even vs odd carbon content, and by linear vs branched.

===Length of fatty acids===
* Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of five or fewer carbons (e.g. butyric acid).
* Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6 to 12 carbons, which can form medium-chain triglycerides.
* Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 13 to 21 carbons.
* Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 22 or more carbons.

===Saturated fatty acids===
Saturated fatty acids have no C=C double bonds. They have the formula CH(CH)COOH, where &quot;n&quot; is some positive integer. An important saturated fatty acid is stearic acid (&quot;n&quot; = 16), which when neutralized with sodium hydroxide is the most common form of soap.

===Unsaturated fatty acids===
Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more C=C double bonds. The C=C double bonds can give either &quot;cis&quot; or &quot;trans&quot; isomers.

; &quot;cis&quot; :A &quot;cis&quot; configuration means that the two hydrogen atoms adjacent to the double bond stick out on the same side of the chain. The rigidity of the double bond freezes its conformation and, in the case of the &quot;cis&quot; isomer, causes the chain to bend and restricts the conformational freedom of the fatty acid. The more double bonds the chain has in the &quot;cis&quot; configuration, the less flexibility it has. When a chain has many &quot;cis&quot; bonds, it becomes quite curved in its most accessible conformations. For example, oleic acid, with one double bond, has a &quot;kink&quot; in it, whereas linoleic acid, with two double bonds, has a more pronounced bend. α-Linolenic acid, with three double bonds, favors a hooked shape. The effect of this is that, in restricted environments, such as when fatty acids are part of a phospholipid in a lipid bilayer or triglycerides in lipid droplets, cis bonds limit the ability of fatty acids to be closely packed, and therefore can affect the melting temperature of the membrane or of the fat. Cis unsaturated fatty acids, however, increase cellular membrane fluidity, whereas trans unsaturated fatty acids do not.
; &quot;trans&quot; : A &quot;trans&quot; configuration, by contrast, means that the adjacent two hydrogen atoms lie on &quot;opposite&quot; sides of the chain. As a result, they do not cause the chain to bend much, and their shape is similar to straight saturated fatty acids.

In most naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids, each double bond has three (n−3), six (n−6), or nine (n−9) carbon atoms after it, and all double bonds have a cis configuration. Most fatty acids in the &quot;trans&quot; configuration (trans fats) are not found in nature and are the result of human processing (e.g., hydrogenation). Some trans fatty acids also occur naturally in the milk and meat of ruminants (such as cattle and sheep). They are produced, by fermentation, in the rumen of these animals. They are also found in dairy products from milk of ruminants, and may be also found in breast milk of women who obtained them from their diet.

The geometric differences between the various types of unsaturated fatty acids, as well as between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, play an important role in biological processes, and in the construction of biological structures (such as cell membranes).

===Even- vs odd-chained fatty acids===
Most fatty acids are even-chained, e.g. stearic (C18) and oleic (C18), meaning they are composed of an even number of carbon atoms. Some fatty acids have odd numbers of carbon atoms; they are referred to as odd-chained fatty acids (OCFA). The most common OCFA are the saturated C15 and C17 derivatives, pentadecanoic acid and heptadecanoic acid respectively, which are found in dairy products. On a molecular level, OCFAs are biosynthesized and metabolized slightly differently from the even-chained relatives.

===Branching===
Most common fatty acids are straight-chain compounds, with no additional carbon atoms bonded as side groups to the main hydrocarbon chain. Branched-chain fatty acids contain one or more methyl groups bonded to the hydrocarbon chain.

==Nomenclature==

===Carbon atom numbering===

Most naturally occurring fatty acids have an unbranched chain of carbon atoms, with a carboxyl group (–COOH) at one end, and a methyl group (–CH3) at the other end.

The position of each carbon atom in the backbone of a fatty acid is usually indicated by counting from 1 at the −COOH end. Carbon number &quot;x&quot; is often abbreviated C-&quot;x&quot; (or sometimes C&quot;x&quot;), with &quot;x&quot; = 1, 2, 3, etc. This is the numbering scheme recommended by the IUPAC.

Another convention uses letters of the Greek alphabet in sequence, starting with the first carbon &quot;after&quot; the carboxyl group. Thus carbon α (alpha) is C-2, carbon β (beta) is C-3, and so forth.

Although fatty acids can be of diverse lengths, in this second convention the last carbon in the chain is always labelled as ω (omega), which is the last letter in the Greek alphabet. A third numbering convention counts the carbons from that end, using the labels &quot;ω&quot;, &quot;ω−1&quot;, &quot;ω−2&quot;. Alternatively, the label &quot;ω−&quot;x&quot;&quot; is written &quot;n−&quot;x&quot;&quot;, where the &quot;n&quot; is meant to represent the number of carbons in the chain.

In either numbering scheme, the position of a double bond in a fatty acid chain is always specified by giving the label of the carbon closest to the carboxyl end. Thus, in an 18 carbon fatty acid, a double bond between C-12 (or ω−6) and C-13 (or ω−5) is said to be &quot;at&quot; position C-12 or ω−6. The IUPAC naming of the acid, such as &quot;octadec-12-enoic acid&quot; (or the more pronounceable variant &quot;12-octadecanoic acid&quot;) is always based on the &quot;C&quot; numbering.

The notation Δ&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;... is traditionally used to specify a fatty acid with double bonds at positions &quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;... (The capital Greek letter &quot;Δ&quot; (delta) corresponds to Roman &quot;D&quot;, for Double bond). Thus, for example, the 20-carbon arachidonic acid is Δ5,8,11,14, meaning that it has double bonds between carbons 5 and 6, 8 and 9, 11 and 12, and 14 and 15.

In the context of human diet and fat metabolism, unsaturated fatty acids are often classified by the position of the double bond closest between to the ω carbon (only), even in the case of multiple double bonds such as the essential fatty acids. Thus linoleic acid (18 carbons, Δ9,12), γ-linolenic acid (18-carbon, Δ6,9,12), and arachidonic acid (20-carbon, Δ5,8,11,14) are all classified as &quot;ω−6&quot; fatty acids; meaning that their formula ends with –CH=CH–––––.

Fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms are called odd-chain fatty acids, whereas the rest are even-chain fatty acids. The difference is relevant to gluconeogenesis.

===Naming of fatty acids===
The following table describes the most common systems of naming fatty acids.


=== Free fatty acids ===

When circulating in the plasma (plasma fatty acids), not in their ester, fatty acids are known as non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) or free fatty acids (FFAs). FFAs are always bound to a transport protein, such as albumin.

FFAs also form from triglyceride food oils and fats by hydrolysis, contributing to the characteristic rancid odor. An analogous process happens in biodiesel with risk of part corrosion.

==Production==

===Industrial===
Fatty acids are usually produced industrially by the hydrolysis of triglycerides, with the removal of glycerol (see oleochemicals). Phospholipids represent another source. Some fatty acids are produced synthetically by hydrocarboxylation of alkenes.

===By animals===

In animals, fatty acids are formed from carbohydrates predominantly in the liver, adipose tissue, and the mammary glands during lactation.

Carbohydrates are converted into pyruvate by glycolysis as the first important step in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids. Pyruvate is then decarboxylated to form acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However, this acetyl CoA needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, citrate (produced by the condensation of acetyl-CoA with oxaloacetate) is removed from the citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate is returned to the mitochondrion as malate. The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase into malonyl-CoA, the first committed step in the synthesis of fatty acids.

Malonyl-CoA is then involved in a repeating series of reactions that lengthens the growing fatty acid chain by two carbons at a time. Almost all natural fatty acids, therefore, have even numbers of carbon atoms. When synthesis is complete the free fatty acids are nearly always combined with glycerol (three fatty acids to one glycerol molecule) to form triglycerides, the main storage form of fatty acids, and thus of energy in animals. However, fatty acids are also important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed (the cell wall, and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells, such as the nucleus, the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus).

The &quot;uncombined fatty acids&quot; or &quot;free fatty acids&quot; found in the circulation of animals come from the breakdown (or lipolysis) of stored triglycerides. Because they are insoluble in water, these fatty acids are transported bound to plasma albumin. The levels of &quot;free fatty acids&quot; in the blood are limited by the availability of albumin binding sites. They can be taken up from the blood by all cells that have mitochondria (with the exception of the cells of the central nervous system). Fatty acids can only be broken down in mitochondria, by means of beta-oxidation followed by further combustion in the citric acid cycle to CO and water. Cells in the central nervous system, although they possess mitochondria, cannot take free fatty acids up from the blood, as the blood–brain barrier is impervious to most free fatty acids, excluding short-chain fatty acids and medium-chain fatty acids. These cells have to manufacture their own fatty acids from carbohydrates, as described above, in order to produce and maintain the phospholipids of their cell membranes, and those of their organelles.

====Variation between animal species====
Studies on the cell membranes of mammals and reptiles discovered that mammalian cell membranes are composed of a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (DHA, omega−3 fatty acid) than reptiles. Studies on bird fatty acid composition have noted similar proportions to mammals but with 1/3rd less omega−3 fatty acids as compared to omega−6 for a given body size. This fatty acid composition results in a more fluid cell membrane but also one that is permeable to various ions ( &amp; ), resulting in cell membranes that are more costly to maintain. This maintenance cost has been argued to be one of the key causes for the high metabolic rates and concomitant warm-bloodedness of mammals and birds. However polyunsaturation of cell membranes may also occur in response to chronic cold temperatures as well. In fish increasingly cold environments lead to increasingly high cell membrane content of both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, to maintain greater membrane fluidity (and functionality) at the lower temperatures.

==Fatty acids in dietary fats==
The following table gives the fatty acid, vitamin E and cholesterol composition of some common dietary fats.

==Reactions of fatty acids==
Fatty acids exhibit reactions like other carboxylic acids, i.e. they undergo esterification and acid-base reactions.

===Transesterification===
All fatty acids transesterify. Typically, transesterification is practiced in the conversion of fats to fatty acid methyl esters. These esters are used for biodiesel. They are also hydrogenated to give fatty alcohols. Even vinyl esters can be made by transesterification using vinyl acetate.

===Acid-base reactions===
Fatty acids do not show a great variation in their acidities, as indicated by their respective p&quot;K&quot;a. Nonanoic acid, for example, has a p&quot;K&quot; of 4.96, being only slightly weaker than acetic acid (4.76). As the chain length increases, the solubility of the fatty acids in water decreases, so that the longer-chain fatty acids have minimal effect on the pH of an aqueous solution. Near neutral pH, fatty acids exist at their conjugate bases, i.e. oleate, etc.

Solutions of fatty acids in ethanol can be titrated with sodium hydroxide solution using phenolphthalein as an indicator. This analysis is used to determine the free fatty acid content of fats; i.e., the proportion of the triglycerides that have been hydrolyzed.

Neutralization of fatty acids, like saponification, is a widely practiced route to metallic soaps.

===Hydrogenation and hardening===
Hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids is widely practiced. Typical conditions involve 2.0–3.0 MPa of H pressure, 150 °C, and nickel supported on silica as a catalyst. This treatment affords saturated fatty acids. The extent of hydrogenation is indicated by the iodine number. Hydrogenated fatty acids are less prone toward rancidification. Since the saturated fatty acids are higher melting than the unsaturated precursors, the process is called hardening. Related technology is used to convert vegetable oils into margarine. The hydrogenation of triglycerides (vs fatty acids) is advantageous because the carboxylic acids degrade the nickel catalysts, affording nickel soaps. During partial hydrogenation, unsaturated fatty acids can be isomerized from &quot;cis&quot; to &quot;trans&quot; configuration.

More forcing hydrogenation, i.e. using higher pressures of H and higher temperatures, converts fatty acids into fatty alcohols. Fatty alcohols are, however, more easily produced from simpler fatty acid esters, like the fatty acid methyl esters (&quot;FAME&quot;s).

===Decarboxylation===
Ketonic decarboxylation is a method useful for producing symmetrical ketones from carboxylic acids. The process involves reactions of the carboxylic acid with an inorganic base. Stearone is prepared by heating magnesium stearate.

===Chemistry of saturated vs unsaturated acids===
The reactivity of saturated fatty acids is usually associated with the carboxylic acid or the adjacent methylene group By conversion to their acid chlorides, they can be converted to the symmetrical fatty ketone laurone (). Treatment with sulfur trioxide gives the α-sulfonic acids.

The reactivity of unsaturated fatty acids is often dominated by the site of unsaturation. These reactions are the basis of ozonolysis, hydrogenation, and the iodine number. Ozonolysis (degradation by ozone) is practiced in the production of azelaic acid ((CH)(COH)) from oleic acid.

==Circulation==

===Digestion and intake===

Short- and medium-chain fatty acids are absorbed directly into the blood via intestine capillaries and travel through the portal vein just as other absorbed nutrients do. However, long-chain fatty acids are not directly released into the intestinal capillaries. Instead they are absorbed into the fatty walls of the intestine villi and reassemble again into triglycerides. The triglycerides are coated with cholesterol and protein (protein coat) into a compound called a chylomicron.

From within the cell, the chylomicron is released into a lymphatic capillary called a lacteal, which merges into larger lymphatic vessels. It is transported via the lymphatic system and the thoracic duct up to a location near the heart (where the arteries and veins are larger). The thoracic duct empties the chylomicrons into the bloodstream via the left subclavian vein. At this point the chylomicrons can transport the triglycerides to tissues where they are stored or metabolized for energy.

===Metabolism===

Fatty acids are broken down to CO and water by the intra-cellular mitochondria through beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle. In the final step (oxidative phosphorylation), reactions with oxygen release a lot of energy, captured in the form of large quantities of ATP. Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this purpose, but fatty acids release more energy per gram. Fatty acids (provided either by ingestion or by drawing on triglycerides stored in fatty tissues) are distributed to cells to serve as a fuel for muscular contraction and general metabolism.

====Essential fatty acids====

Fatty acids that are required for good health but cannot be made in sufficient quantity from other substrates, and therefore must be obtained from food, are called essential fatty acids. There are two series of essential fatty acids: one has a double bond three carbon atoms away from the methyl end; the other has a double bond six carbon atoms away from the methyl end. Humans lack the ability to introduce double bonds in fatty acids beyond carbons 9 and 10, as counted from the carboxylic acid side. Two essential fatty acids are linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). These fatty acids are widely distributed in plant oils. The human body has a limited ability to convert ALA into the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids — eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which can also be obtained from fish. Omega−3 and omega−6 fatty acids are biosynthetic precursors to endocannabinoids with antinociceptive, anxiolytic, and neurogenic properties.

===Distribution===

Blood fatty acids adopt distinct forms in different stages in the blood circulation. They are taken in through the intestine in chylomicrons, but also exist in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) after processing in the liver. In addition, when released from adipocytes, fatty acids exist in the blood as free fatty acids.

It is proposed that the blend of fatty acids exuded by mammalian skin, together with lactic acid and pyruvic acid, is distinctive and enables animals with a keen sense of smell to differentiate individuals.

==Skin==
The stratum corneum the outermost layer of the epidermis is composed of terminally differentiated and enucleated corneocytes within a lipid matrix. Together with cholesterol and ceramides, free fatty acids form a water-impermeable barrier that prevents evaporative water loss. Generally, the epidermal lipid matrix is composed of an equimolar mixture of ceramides (about 50% by weight), cholesterol (25%), and free fatty acids (15%). Saturated fatty acids 16 and 18 carbons in length are the dominant types in the epidermis, while unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids of various other lengths are also present. The relative abundance of the different fatty acids in the epidermis is dependent on the body site the skin is covering. There are also characteristic epidermal fatty acid alterations that occur in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and other inflammatory conditions.

==Analysis==

The chemical analysis of fatty acids in lipids typically begins with an interesterification step that breaks down their original esters (triglycerides, waxes, phospholipids etc.) and converts them to methyl esters, which are then separated by gas chromatography or analyzed by gas chromatography and mid-infrared spectroscopy.

Separation of unsaturated isomers is possible by silver ion complemented thin-layer chromatography. Other separation techniques include high-performance liquid chromatography (with short columns packed with silica gel with bonded phenylsulfonic acid groups whose hydrogen atoms have been exchanged for silver ions). The role of silver lies in its ability to form complexes with unsaturated compounds.

==Industrial uses==
Fatty acids are mainly used in the production of soap, both for cosmetic purposes and, in the case of metallic soaps, as lubricants. Fatty acids are also converted, via their methyl esters, to fatty alcohols and fatty amines, which are precursors to surfactants, detergents, and lubricants. Other applications include their use as emulsifiers, texturizing agents, wetting agents, anti-foam agents, or stabilizing agents.

Esters of fatty acids with simpler alcohols (such as methyl-, ethyl-, n-propyl-, isopropyl- and butyl esters) are used as emollients in cosmetics and other personal care products and as synthetic lubricants. Esters of fatty acids with more complex alcohols, such as sorbitol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol are consumed in food, or used for personal care and water treatment, or used as synthetic lubricants or fluids for metal working.

<text>Fearless is a 1993 American drama film directed by Peter Weir and starring Jeff Bridges, Isabella Rossellini, Rosie Perez and John Turturro. It was written by Rafael Yglesias, adapted from his novel of the same name.

Rosie Perez was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Carla Rodrigo. The film was also entered into the 44th Berlin International Film Festival. Jeff Bridges&#x27;s role as Max Klein is widely regarded as one of the best performances of his career. The film&#x27;s soundtrack features part of the first movement of Henryk Górecki&#x27;s Symphony No. 3, subtitled &quot;Symphony of Sorrowful Songs&quot;. The film&#x27;s screenwriter was inspired to write the script after he was in a car accident. Yglesias began writing the story after reading about United Airlines Flight 232, that crashed in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1989.

==Plot==
Max Klein survives an airline crash. The plane plummets, but he is strangely calm. This calm enables him to dispel fear in the flight cabin. He sits next to Byron Hummel, a young boy flying alone. Flight attendants move through the cabin, telling another passenger, Carla Rodrigo, traveling with an infant, to hold the child in her lap as the plane plummets out of control, while telling other passengers to buckle into their seats. Max was telling his business partner, Jeff Gordon, of his fear of flying as they took off.

In the aftermath of the crash, most passengers died. Among the few survivors, most are terribly injured but Max is unhurt. The crash site is chaotic, filled with first responders and other emergency personnel. Focusing on the survivors, a team of investigators from the FAA and the airline conduct interviews. Max is repelled by all the chaos and disgusted by the investigators wanting to interview him.

Max rents a car and starts driving home. Along the way, he visits his old high school girlfriend Alison, who he had not seen for 20 years. At the restaurant, Alison is surprised to see Max eating a strawberry, as he is allergic to them. He grins, then finishes it without an allergic reaction.

The next morning, Max is accosted by FBI investigators. They question why he chose not to contact his family to tell them he is fine. The airline representative offers Max train tickets to return home, but he asks for airline tickets, as he no longer fears air travel. The airline books him on the flight. They seat him next to Dr. Bill Perlman, the airline&#x27;s psychiatrist.

Dr. Perlman annoyingly tags behind Max back to his home, prodding him for information about the crash. Max snaps back at the psychiatrist rudely, to be rid of him. Max&#x27;s wife Laura Klein notices his strange behavior and that he seems somehow changed. Max&#x27;s late business partner&#x27;s wife Nan Gordon asks about Jeff&#x27;s last moments. Max says Jeff died in the crash.

The media call Max &quot;The Good Samaritan&quot; in news reports. The boy Max sat next to, Byron, publicly thanks him in television interviews. For the way he comforted passengers while the plane fell out of control during the crash, Max is considered a hero.

Max avoids the press and becomes distant from Laura and his son Jonah. His persona is radically changed, and he is preoccupied with his new perspective on life following the near-death experience. Max begins drawing abstract pictures of the crash. As he survived without injury, he thinks himself invulnerable to death.

Because of his confidence, Dr. Perlman encourages Max to meet with fellow survivor Carla Rodrigo, whose infant was held in her lap while the plane fell. She struggles with survivor&#x27;s guilt, and is traumatized for not holding onto him tightly enough, although she was following the flight attendant&#x27;s instructions.

Max and Carla develop a close friendship. He helps her to get past the trauma, to free herself from guilt, deliberately crashing his car to show that it was physically impossible for any person to hold onto anything due to the forces of the crash.

Attorney Steven Brillstein encourages Max to exaggerate testimony, to maximize the settlement offer from the airline. He reluctantly agrees when he is confronted with Nan&#x27;s financial predicament as a widow.

Cognitive dissonance spurs Max to a panic attack. He runs out of the office, to the roof of the building. He climbs onto the roof&#x27;s edge. As Max stands on the ledge, looking down at the streets below, his panic subsides. He rejoices in fearlessness. Laura finds Max on the ledge. He is spinning on it, with his overcoat billowing across his face.

Brillstein arrives at the Kleins&#x27; to celebrate the airline&#x27;s settlement offer, bringing a fruit basket. Max eats one of the strawberries. This time he experiences an allergic reaction. Max is resuscitated by Laura and survives. He recovers his emotional connection to his family, to the world and to the reality of yet another chance at life.

==Cast==
==Production==
Winona Ryder auditioned for the film but was rejected as Bridges felt she was too young to portray his love-interest.

==Aesthetic elements==
A book containing the painting &quot;The Ascent into the Empyrean&quot; by Hieronymus Bosch is shown, and it is said that the dying go into the light of heaven &quot;naked and alone&quot;. Near the finale as Max lies on the ground, he relives moving from the fuselage of the aircraft and for a moment moves towards the tunnel of light that appears to be modeled on the painting.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Fearless&quot; has an approval rating of 84% based on reviews from 43 critics, with an average score of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;This underrated gem from director Peter Weir features an outstanding performance from Jeff Bridges as a man dealing with profound grief.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it three out of four stars, and wrote: &quot;&quot;Fearless&quot; is like a short story that shines a bright light, briefly, into a corner where you usually do not look.&quot;
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;Mr. Bridges does well with a difficult role&quot;, and Todd McCarthy of
&quot;Variety&quot; called it one of Bridges best performances. McCarthy was positive about the film, calling it &quot;beautifully made in all respects&quot;, but noted that as a mainstream film about profound issues and emotions, some audiences will appreciate it, but others may find it pretentious. Geoff Andrew of &quot;Time Out&quot; wrote: &quot;As often with Weir, there&#x27;s considerably less here than meets the eye.&quot;

==Accolades==
==Home media==
With video and audio quality superseding previous home video releases, &quot;Fearless&quot; was released on Blu-ray Disc by the Warner Archive Collection in November 2013.

<text>Franklin Delano Roosevelt (January 30, 1882April 12, 1945), also known as FDR, was the 32nd president of the United States, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. He is the longest-serving U.S. president, and the only one to have served more than two terms. His initial two terms were centered on combating the Great Depression, while his third and fourth saw him shift his focus to America&#x27;s involvement in World War II.

A member of the prominent Delano and Roosevelt families, Roosevelt was elected to the New York State Senate from 1911 to 1913 and was then the assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Cox&#x27;s running mate on the Democratic Party&#x27;s ticket in the 1920 U.S. presidential election, but Cox lost to Republican nominee Warren G. Harding. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness that permanently paralyzed his legs. Partly through the encouragement of his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, he returned to public office as governor of New York from 1929 to 1933, during which he promoted programs to combat the Great Depression. In the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated president Herbert Hoover in a landslide victory.

During his first 100 days as president, Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented federal legislation and directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression, implementing the New Deal, building the New Deal coalition, and realigning American politics into the Fifth Party System. He created numerous programs to provide relief to the unemployed and farmers while seeking economic recovery with the National Recovery Administration and other programs. He also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor, and presided over the end of Prohibition. In 1936, Roosevelt won a landslide reelection. He was unable to expand the Supreme Court in 1937, the same year the conservative coalition was formed to block the implementation of further New Deal programs and reforms. Major surviving programs and legislation implemented under Roosevelt include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Social Security. In 1940, he ran successfully for reelection, before the official implementation of term limits.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Roosevelt obtained a declaration of war on Japan. When in turn, Japan&#x27;s Axis partners, Nazi Germany and Italy, declared war on the U.S. on December 11, 1941, he secured additional declarations of war from the United States Congress. He worked closely with other national leaders in leading the Allies against the Axis powers. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the American economy to support the war effort and implemented a Europe first strategy. He also initiated the development of the first atomic bomb and worked with the other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the United Nations and other post-war institutions, even coining the term &quot;United Nations&quot;. Roosevelt won reelection in 1944 but died in 1945 after his physical health seriously and steadily declined during the war years. Since then, several of his actions have come under criticism, such as his ordering of the internment of Japanese Americans. Nonetheless, historical rankings consistently place him among the three greatest American presidents.

==Early life and marriage==

===Childhood===
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New York, to businessman James Roosevelt I and his second wife, Sara Ann Delano. His parents, who were sixth cousins, came from wealthy, established New York families—the Roosevelts, the Aspinwalls and the Delanos, respectively—and resided at Springwood, a large estate south of Hyde Park&#x27;s historic center. Franklin&#x27;s father James, was a prominent Bourbon Democrat who once took him to meet President Grover Cleveland. During this meeting, Cleveland said: &quot;My little man, I am making a strange wish for you. It is that you may never be President of the United States.&quot; Franklin&#x27;s mother Sara, the dominant influence in his early years, once declared, &quot;My son Franklin is a Delano, not a Roosevelt at all.&quot; James, who was 54 when Franklin was born, was considered by some as a remote father, though biographer James MacGregor Burns indicates James interacted with his son more than was typical at the time. Franklin had a half-brother, James Roosevelt &quot;Rosy&quot; Roosevelt, from his father&#x27;s previous marriage.

===Education and early career===
As a child, Roosevelt learned to ride, shoot, sail, and play polo, tennis, and golf. Frequent trips to Europe—beginning at age two and from age seven to fifteen—helped Roosevelt become conversant in German and French. Except for attending public school in Germany at age nine, Roosevelt was homeschooled by tutors until age 14. He then attended Groton School, an Episcopal boarding school in Groton, Massachusetts. He was not among the more popular Groton students, who were better athletes and had rebellious streaks. Its headmaster, Endicott Peabody, preached the duty of Christians to help the less fortunate and urged his students to enter public service. Peabody remained a strong influence throughout Roosevelt&#x27;s life, officiating at his wedding and visiting him as president.

Like most of his Groton classmates, Roosevelt went to Harvard College. He was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and the Fly Club, and served as a school cheerleader. Roosevelt was relatively undistinguished as a student or athlete, but he became editor-in-chief of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; daily newspaper, which required ambition, energy, and the ability to manage others. He later said, &quot;I took economics courses in college for four years, and everything I was taught was wrong.&quot;

Roosevelt&#x27;s father died in 1900, distressing him greatly. The following year, Roosevelt&#x27;s fifth cousin Theodore Roosevelt became U.S. president. Theodore&#x27;s vigorous leadership style and reforming zeal made him Franklin&#x27;s role model and hero. He graduated from Harvard in three years in 1903 with an A.B. in history. He remained there for a fourth year, taking graduate courses. Like his cousin Theodore, he was a member of The Explorers Club.

Roosevelt entered Columbia Law School in 1904, but dropped out in 1907 after passing the New York bar examination. In 1908, he took a job with the prestigious law firm of Carter Ledyard &amp; Milburn, working in the firm&#x27;s admiralty law division.

===Marriage, family, and extramarital affairs===

During his second year of college, Roosevelt met and proposed to Boston heiress Alice Sohier, who turned him down. Franklin then began courting his childhood acquaintance and fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt, a niece of Theodore Roosevelt. In 1903, Franklin proposed to Eleanor. Despite resistance from his mother, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were married on March 17, 1905. Eleanor&#x27;s father, Elliott, was deceased; Theodore, who was then president, gave away the bride. The young couple moved into Springwood. Franklin&#x27;s mother, Sara Roosevelt, also provided a townhouse for the newlyweds in New York City, and had a house built for herself alongside that townhouse. Eleanor never felt at home in the houses at Hyde Park or New York City; however, she loved the family&#x27;s vacation home on Campobello Island, which was also a gift from Sara.

Burns indicates that young Franklin Roosevelt was self-assured and at ease in the upper class. On the other hand, Eleanor was shy and disliked social life. Initially, Eleanor stayed home to raise their children. As his father had done, Franklin left childcare to his wife, and Eleanor delegated the task to caregivers. She later said that she knew &quot;absolutely nothing about handling or feeding a baby&quot;. They had six children. Anna, James, and Elliott were born in 1906, 1907, and 1910, respectively. The couple&#x27;s second son, Franklin, died in infancy in 1909. Another son, also named Franklin, was born in 1914, and the youngest, John, was born in 1916.

Roosevelt had several extramarital affairs. He commenced an affair with Eleanor&#x27;s social secretary, Lucy Mercer, soon after she was hired in 1914. That affair was discovered by Eleanor in 1918. Franklin contemplated divorcing Eleanor, but Sara objected, and Mercer would not marry a divorced man with five children. Franklin and Eleanor remained married, and Franklin promised never to see Mercer again. Eleanor never forgave him for the affair, and their marriage shifted to become a political partnership. Eleanor soon established a separate home in Hyde Park at Val-Kill and devoted herself to social and political causes independent of her husband. The emotional break in their marriage was so severe that when Franklin asked Eleanor in 1942—in light of his failing health—to come live with him again, she refused. Roosevelt was not always aware of Eleanor&#x27;s visits to the White House. For some time, Eleanor could not easily reach Roosevelt on the telephone without his secretary&#x27;s help; Franklin, in turn, did not visit Eleanor&#x27;s New York City apartment until late 1944.

Franklin broke his promise to Eleanor regarding Lucy Mercer. He and Mercer maintained a formal correspondence and began seeing each other again by 1941. Roosevelt&#x27;s son Elliott claimed that his father had a 20-year affair with his private secretary, Marguerite LeHand. Another son, James, stated that &quot;there is a real possibility that a romantic relationship existed&quot; between his father and Crown Princess Märtha of Norway, who resided in the White House during part of World War II. Aides referred to her at the time as &quot;the president&#x27;s girlfriend&quot;, and gossip linking the two romantically appeared in newspapers.

==Early political career (1910–1920)==
===New York state senator (1910–1913)===
Roosevelt cared little for the practice of law and told friends he planned to enter politics. Despite his admiration for cousin Theodore, Franklin shared his father&#x27;s bond with the Democratic Party, and in preparation for the 1910 elections, the party recruited Roosevelt to run for a seat in the New York State Assembly. Roosevelt was a compelling recruit: he had the personality and energy for campaigning and the money to pay for his own campaign. But Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign for the state assembly ended after the Democratic incumbent, Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler, chose to seek re-election. Rather than putting his political hopes on hold, Roosevelt ran for a seat in the New York State Senate. The senate district, located in Dutchess, Columbia, and Putnam, was strongly Republican. Roosevelt feared that opposition from Theodore could end his campaign, but Theodore encouraged his candidacy despite their party differences. Acting as his own campaign manager, Roosevelt traveled throughout the senate district via automobile at a time when few could afford a car. Due to his aggressive campaign, his name gained recognition in the Hudson Valley, and in the Democratic landslide in the 1910 United States elections, Roosevelt won a surprising victory.

Despite short legislative sessions, Roosevelt treated his new position as a full-time career. Taking his seat on January 1, 1911, Roosevelt soon became the leader of a group of &quot;Insurgents&quot; in opposition to the Tammany Hall machine that dominated the state Democratic Party. In the 1911 U.S. Senate election, which was determined in a joint session of the New York state legislature, Roosevelt and nineteen other Democrats caused a prolonged deadlock by opposing a series of Tammany-backed candidates. Tammany threw its backing behind James A. O&#x27;Gorman, a highly regarded judge whom Roosevelt found acceptable, and O&#x27;Gorman won the election in late March. Roosevelt in the process became a popular figure among New York Democrats. News articles and cartoons depicted &quot;the second coming of a Roosevelt&quot;, sending &quot;cold shivers down the spine of Tammany&quot;.

Shortly after being elected to the New York State Senate, Roosevelt became a Freemason, on October 10, 1911 at Holland Lodge No. 8 in New York City. 

Roosevelt also opposed Tammany Hall by supporting New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s successful bid for the 1912 Democratic nomination. The election became a three-way contest when Theodore Roosevelt left the Republican Party to launch a third-party campaign against Wilson and sitting Republican president William Howard Taft. Franklin&#x27;s decision to back Wilson over his cousin in the general election alienated some of his family, except Theodore. Roosevelt overcame a bout of typhoid fever that year and, with help from journalist Louis McHenry Howe, he was re-elected in the 1912 elections. After the election, he served as chairman of the Agriculture Committee; his success with farm and labor bills was a precursor to his later New Deal policies. He had then become more consistently progressive, in support of labor and social welfare programs.

===Assistant Secretary of the Navy (1913–1919)===
Roosevelt&#x27;s support of Wilson led to his appointment in March 1913 as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, the second-ranking official in the Navy Department after Secretary Josephus Daniels who paid it little attention. Roosevelt had an affection for the Navy, was well-read on the subject, and was an ardent supporter of a large, efficient force. With Wilson&#x27;s support, Daniels and Roosevelt instituted a merit-based promotion system and extended civilian control over the autonomous departments of the Navy. Roosevelt oversaw the Navy&#x27;s civilian employees and earned the respect of union leaders for his fairness in resolving disputes. No strikes occurred during his seven-plus years in the office, as he gained valuable experience in labor issues, wartime management, naval issues, and logistics.

In 1914, Roosevelt ran for the seat of retiring Republican Senator Elihu Root of New York. Though he had the backing of Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo and Governor Martin H. Glynn, he faced a formidable opponent in Tammany Hall&#x27;s James W. Gerard. He also was without Wilson&#x27;s support, as the president needed Tammany&#x27;s forces for his legislation and 1916 re-election. Roosevelt was soundly defeated in the Democratic primary by Gerard, who in turn lost the general election to Republican James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr. He learned that federal patronage alone, without White House support, could not defeat a strong local organization. After the election, he and Tammany Hall boss Charles Francis Murphy sought accommodation and became allies.

Roosevelt refocused on the Navy Department as World War I broke out in Europe in August 1914. Though he remained publicly supportive of Wilson, Roosevelt sympathized with the Preparedness Movement, whose leaders strongly favored the Allied Powers and called for a military build-up. The Wilson administration initiated an expansion of the Navy after the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; by a German submarine, and Roosevelt helped establish the United States Navy Reserve and the Council of National Defense. In April 1917, after Germany declared it would engage in unrestricted submarine warfare and attacked several U.S. ships, Congress approved Wilson&#x27;s call for a declaration of war on Germany.

Roosevelt requested that he be allowed to serve as a naval officer, but Wilson insisted that he continue as Assistant Secretary. For the next year, Roosevelt remained in Washington to coordinate the naval deployment, as the Navy expanded fourfold. In the summer of 1918, Roosevelt traveled to Europe to inspect naval installations and meet with French and British officials. On account of his relation to Theodore Roosevelt, he was received very prominently considering his relatively junior rank, obtaining long private audiences with King George V and prime ministers David Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau, as well as a tour of the battlefield at Verdun. In September, on the ship voyage back to the&quot; United States, he contracted pandemic influenza with complicating pneumonia, which left him unable to work for a month.

After Germany signed an armistice in November 1918, Daniels and Roosevelt supervised the demobilization of the Navy. Against the advice of older officers such as Admiral William Benson—who claimed he could not &quot;conceive of any use the fleet will ever have for aviation&quot;—Roosevelt personally ordered the preservation of the Navy&#x27;s Aviation Division. With the Wilson administration near an end, Roosevelt planned his next run for office. He approached Herbert Hoover about running for the 1920 Democratic presidential nomination, with Roosevelt as his running mate.

===Campaign for vice president (1920)===

Roosevelt&#x27;s plan for Hoover to run fell through after Hoover publicly declared himself to be a Republican, but Roosevelt decided to seek the 1920 vice presidential nomination. After Governor James M. Cox of Ohio won the party&#x27;s presidential nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention, he chose Roosevelt as his running mate, and the convention nominated him by acclamation. Although his nomination surprised most people, he balanced the ticket as a moderate, a Wilsonian, and a prohibitionist with a famous name. Roosevelt, then 38, resigned as Assistant Secretary after the Democratic convention and campaigned across the nation for the party ticket.

During the campaign, Cox and Roosevelt defended the Wilson administration and the League of Nations, both of which were unpopular in 1920. Roosevelt personally supported U.S. membership in the League, but, unlike Wilson, he favored compromising with Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and other &quot;Reservationists&quot;. Republicans Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge defeated the Cox–Roosevelt ticket in the presidential election by a wide margin, carrying every state outside of the South. Roosevelt accepted the loss and later reflected that the relationships and goodwill that he built in the 1920 campaign proved to be a major asset in his 1932 campaign. The 1920 election also saw the first public participation of Eleanor Roosevelt who, with the support of Louis Howe, established herself as a valuable political player. After the election, Roosevelt returned to New York City, where he practiced law and served as a vice president of the Fidelity and Deposit Company.

==Paralytic illness and political comeback (1921–1928)==

 Roosevelt sought to build support for a political comeback in the 1922 elections, but his career was derailed by an illness. It began while the Roosevelts were vacationing at Campobello Island in August 1921. His main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery. Roosevelt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down and was diagnosed with polio. A 2003 study strongly favored a diagnosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome, but historians have continued to describe his paralysis according to the initial diagnosis.

Though his mother favored his retirement from public life, Roosevelt, his wife, and Roosevelt&#x27;s close friend and adviser, Louis Howe, were all determined that he continue his political career. He convinced many people that he was improving, which he believed to be essential prior to running for office. He laboriously taught himself to walk short distances while wearing iron braces on his hips and legs, by swiveling his torso while supporting himself with a cane. He was careful never to be seen using his wheelchair in public, and great care was taken to prevent any portrayal in the press that would highlight his disability. However, his disability was well known before and during his presidency and became a major part of his image. He usually appeared in public standing upright, supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons.

Beginning in 1925, Roosevelt spent most of his time in the Southern United States, at first on his houseboat, the &quot;Larooco&quot;. Intrigued by the potential benefits of hydrotherapy, he established a rehabilitation center at Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1926, assembling a staff of physical therapists and using most of his inheritance to purchase the Merriweather Inn. In 1938, he founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, leading to the development of polio vaccines.

Roosevelt remained active in New York politics while also establishing contacts in the South, particularly in Georgia, in the 1920s. He issued an open letter endorsing Al Smith&#x27;s successful campaign in New York&#x27;s 1922 gubernatorial election, which both aided Smith and showed Roosevelt&#x27;s continuing relevance as a political figure. Roosevelt and Smith came from different backgrounds and never fully trusted one another, but Roosevelt supported Smith&#x27;s progressive policies, while Smith was happy to have Roosevelt&#x27;s backing.

Roosevelt gave presidential nominating speeches for Smith at the 1924 and 1928 Democratic National Conventions; the speech at the 1924 convention marked a return to public life following his illness and convalescence. That year, the Democrats were badly divided between an urban wing, led by Smith, and a conservative, rural wing, led by William Gibbs McAdoo. On the 101st ballot, the nomination went to John W. Davis, a compromise candidate who suffered a landslide defeat in the 1924 presidential election. Like many, Roosevelt did not abstain from alcohol during Prohibition, but publicly he sought to find a compromise on the issue acceptable to both wings of the party.

In 1925, Smith appointed Roosevelt to the Taconic State Park Commission, and his fellow commissioners chose him as chairman. In this role, he came into conflict with Robert Moses, a Smith protégé, who was the primary force behind the Long Island State Park Commission and the New York State Council of Parks. Roosevelt accused Moses of using the name recognition of prominent individuals including Roosevelt to win political support for state parks, but then diverting funds to the ones Moses favored on Long Island, while Moses worked to block the appointment of Howe to a salaried position as the Taconic commission&#x27;s secretary. Roosevelt served on the commission until the end of 1928, and his contentious relationship with Moses continued as their careers progressed.

In 1923 Edward Bok established the $100,000 American Peace Award for the best plan to deliver world peace. Roosevelt had leisure time and interest, and he drafted a plan for the contest. He never submitted it because Eleanor was selected as a judge for the prize. His plan called for a new world organization that would replace the League of Nations. Although Roosevelt had been the vice-presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket of 1920 that supported the League, by 1924 he was ready to scrap it. His draft of a &quot;Society of Nations&quot; accepted the reservations proposed by Henry Cabot Lodge in the 1919 Senate debate. The new Society would not become involved in the Western Hemisphere, where the Monroe doctrine held sway. It would not have any control over military forces. Although Roosevelt&#x27;s plan was never made public, he thought about the problem a great deal and incorporated some of his 1924 ideas into the design for the United Nations in 1944–1945.

==Governor of New York (1929–1932)==

Smith, the Democratic presidential nominee in the 1928 presidential election, asked Roosevelt to run for governor of New York in the 1928 state election. Roosevelt initially resisted, as he was reluctant to leave Warm Springs and feared a Republican landslide. Party leaders eventually convinced him only he could defeat the Republican gubernatorial nominee, New York Attorney General Albert Ottinger. He won the party&#x27;s gubernatorial nomination by acclamation and again turned to Howe to lead his campaign. Roosevelt was joined on the campaign trail by associates Samuel Rosenman, Frances Perkins, and James Farley. While Smith lost the presidency in a landslide, and was defeated in his home state, Roosevelt was elected governor by a one-percent margin, and became a contender in the next presidential election.

Roosevelt proposed the construction of hydroelectric power plants and addressed the ongoing farm crisis of the 1920s. Relations between Roosevelt and Smith suffered after he chose not to retain key Smith appointees like Moses. He and his wife Eleanor established an understanding for the rest of his career; she would dutifully serve as the governor&#x27;s wife but would also be free to pursue her own agenda and interests. He also began holding &quot;fireside chats&quot;, in which he directly addressed his constituents via radio, often pressuring the New York State Legislature to advance his agenda.

In October 1929, the Wall Street Crash occurred and the Great Depression in the United States began. Roosevelt saw the seriousness of the situation and established a state employment commission. He also became the first governor to publicly endorse the idea of unemployment insurance.

When Roosevelt began his run for a second term in May 1930, he reiterated his doctrine from the campaign two years before: &quot;that progressive government by its very terms must be a living and growing thing, that the battle for it is never-ending and that if we let up for one single moment or one single year, not merely do we stand still but we fall back in the march of civilization.&quot; His platform called for aid to farmers, full employment, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions. He was elected to a second term by a 14% margin.

Roosevelt proposed an economic relief package and the establishment of the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration to distribute those funds. Led first by Jesse I. Straus and then by Harry Hopkins, the agency assisted over one-third of New York&#x27;s population between 1932 and 1938. Roosevelt also began an investigation into corruption in New York City among the judiciary, the police force, and organized crime, prompting the creation of the Seabury Commission. The Seabury investigations exposed an extortion ring, led many public officials to be removed from office, and made the decline of Tammany Hall inevitable. Roosevelt supported reforestation with the Hewitt Amendment in 1931, which gave birth to New York&#x27;s State Forest system.

==1932 presidential election==

As the 1932 presidential election approached, Roosevelt turned his attention to national politics, established a campaign team led by Howe and Farley, and a &quot;brain trust&quot; of policy advisers, primarily composed of Columbia University and Harvard University professors. Some were not so sanguine about his chances, such as Walter Lippmann, the dean of political commentators, who observed: &quot;He is a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be president.&quot;

However, Roosevelt&#x27;s efforts as governor to address the effects of the depression in his own state established him as the front-runner for the 1932 Democratic presidential nomination. Roosevelt rallied the progressive supporters of the Wilson administration while also appealing to many conservatives, establishing himself as the leading candidate in the South and West. The chief opposition to Roosevelt&#x27;s candidacy came from Northeastern conservatives, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner of Texas and Al Smith, the 1928 Democratic presidential nominee.

Roosevelt entered the convention with a delegate lead due to his success in the 1932 Democratic primaries, but most delegates entered the convention unbound to any particular candidate. On the first presidential ballot, Roosevelt received the votes of more than half but less than two-thirds of the delegates, with Smith finishing in a distant second place. Roosevelt then promised the vice-presidential nomination to Garner, who controlled the votes of Texas and California; Garner threw his support behind Roosevelt after the third ballot, and Roosevelt clinched the nomination on the fourth ballot. Roosevelt flew in from New York to Chicago after learning that he had won the nomination, becoming the first major-party presidential nominee to accept the nomination in person. His appearance was essential, to show himself as vigorous, despite his physical disability.

In his acceptance speech, Roosevelt declared, &quot;I pledge you, I pledge myself to a new deal for the American people... This is more than a political campaign. It is a call to arms.&quot; Roosevelt promised securities regulation, tariff reduction, farm relief, government-funded public works, and other government actions to address the Great Depression. Reflecting changing public opinion, the Democratic platform included a call for the repeal of Prohibition; Roosevelt himself had not taken a public stand on the issue prior to the convention but promised to uphold the party platform. Otherwise, Roosevelt&#x27;s primary campaign strategy was one of caution, intent upon avoiding mistakes that would distract from Hoover&#x27;s failings on the economy. His statements attacked the incumbent and included no other specific policies or programs.

After the convention, Roosevelt won endorsements from several progressive Republicans, including George W. Norris, Hiram Johnson, and Robert La Follette Jr. He also reconciled with the party&#x27;s conservative wing, and even Al Smith was persuaded to support the Democratic ticket. Hoover&#x27;s handling of the Bonus Army further damaged the incumbent&#x27;s popularity, as newspapers across the country criticized the use of force to disperse assembled veterans.

Roosevelt won 57% of the popular vote and carried all but six states. Historians and political scientists consider the 1932–36 elections to be a political realignment. Roosevelt&#x27;s victory was enabled by the creation of the New Deal coalition, small farmers, the Southern whites, Catholics, big-city political machines, labor unions, northern black Americans (southern ones were still disfranchised), Jews, intellectuals, and political liberals. The creation of the New Deal coalition transformed American politics and started what political scientists call the &quot;New Deal Party System&quot; or the Fifth Party System. Between the Civil War and 1929, Democrats had rarely controlled both houses of Congress and had won just four of seventeen presidential elections; from 1932 to 1979, Democrats won eight of twelve presidential elections and generally controlled both houses of Congress.

===Transition and assassination attempt===

Roosevelt was elected in November 1932 but like his predecessors did not take office until the following March. After the election, President Hoover sought to convince Roosevelt to renounce much of his campaign platform and to endorse the Hoover administration&#x27;s policies. Roosevelt refused Hoover&#x27;s request to develop a joint program to stop the economic decline, claiming that it would tie his hands and that Hoover had the power to act.

During the transition, Roosevelt chose Howe as his chief of staff, and Farley as Postmaster General. Frances Perkins, as Secretary of Labor, became the first woman appointed to a cabinet position. William H. Woodin, a Republican industrialist close to Roosevelt, was chosen for Secretary of the Treasury, while Roosevelt chose Senator Cordell Hull of Tennessee as Secretary of State. Harold L. Ickes and Henry A. Wallace, two progressive Republicans, were selected for Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture, respectively.

In February 1933, Roosevelt escaped an assassination attempt by Giuseppe Zangara, who expressed a &quot;hate for all rulers&quot;. As he was attempting to shoot Roosevelt, Zangara was struck by a woman with her purse; he instead mortally wounded Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who was sitting alongside Roosevelt.

==Presidency (1933–1945)==
As president, Roosevelt appointed powerful men to top positions in government. However, he made all of his administration&#x27;s major decisions himself, regardless of any delays, inefficiencies, or resentments doing so may have caused. Analyzing the president&#x27;s administrative style, Burns concludes:
===First and second terms (1933–1941)===

When Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, the U.S. was at the nadir of the worst depression in its history. A quarter of the workforce was unemployed, and farmers were in deep trouble as prices had fallen by 60%. Industrial production had fallen by more than half since 1929. Two million people were homeless. By the evening of March 4, 32 of the 48 states—as well as the District of Columbia—had closed their banks.

Historians categorized Roosevelt&#x27;s program as &quot;relief, recovery, and reform&quot;. Relief was urgently needed by the unemployed. Recovery meant boosting the economy back to normal, and reform was required of the financial and banking systems. Through Roosevelt&#x27;s 30 &quot;fireside chats&quot;, he presented his proposals directly to the American public as a series of radio addresses. Energized by his own victory over paralytic illness, he used persistent optimism and activism to renew the national spirit.

====First New Deal (1933–1934)====

On his second day in office, Roosevelt declared a four-day national &quot;bank holiday&quot;, to end the run by depositors seeking to withdraw funds. He called for a special session of Congress on March 9, when Congress passed, almost sight unseen, the Emergency Banking Act. The act, first developed by the Hoover administration and Wall Street bankers, gave the president the power to determine the opening and closing of banks and authorized the Federal Reserve Banks to issue banknotes. The &quot;first 100 Days&quot; of the 73rd United States Congress saw an unprecedented amount of legislation and set a benchmark against which future presidents have been compared. When the banks reopened on Monday, March 15, stock prices rose by 15 percent and in the following weeks over $1 billion was returned to bank vaults, ending the bank panic. On March 22, Roosevelt signed the Cullen–Harrison Act, which brought Prohibition to a close.
Roosevelt saw the establishment of a number of agencies and measures designed to provide relief for the unemployed and others. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration, under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, distributed relief to state governments. The Public Works Administration (PWA), under Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, oversaw the construction of large-scale public works such as dams, bridges, and schools. The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) brought electricity for the first time to millions of rural homes. The most popular of all New Deal agencies—and Roosevelt&#x27;s favorite—was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which hired 250,000 unemployed men for rural projects. Roosevelt also expanded Hoover&#x27;s Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which financed railroads and industry. Congress gave the Federal Trade Commission broad regulatory powers and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners. Roosevelt also set up the Agricultural Adjustment Administration to increase commodity prices, by paying farmers to leave land uncultivated and cut herds. In many instances, crops were plowed under and livestock killed, while many Americans died of hunger and were ill-clothed; critics labeled such policies &quot;utterly idiotic&quot;.

Reform of the economy was the goal of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. It sought to end cutthroat competition by forcing industries to establish rules such as minimum prices, agreements not to compete, and production restrictions. Industry leaders negotiated the rules with NIRA officials, who suspended antitrust laws in return for better wages. The Supreme Court in May 1935 declared NIRA unconstitutional, to Roosevelt&#x27;s chagrin. He reformed financial regulations with the Glass–Steagall Act, creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to underwrite savings deposits. The act also limited affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms. In 1934, the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to regulate the trading of securities, while the Federal Communications Commission was established to regulate telecommunications.

The NIRA included $3.3 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) of spending through the Public Works Administration to support recovery. Roosevelt worked with Senator Norris to create the largest government-owned industrial enterprise in American history—the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)—which built dams and power stations, controlled floods, and modernized agriculture and home conditions in the poverty-stricken Tennessee Valley. However, locals criticized the TVA for displacing thousands of people for these projects. The Soil Conservation Service trained farmers in the proper methods of cultivation, and with the TVA, Roosevelt became the father of soil conservation. Executive Order 6102 declared that all privately held gold of American citizens was to be sold to the U.S. Treasury and the price raised from $20 to $35 per ounce. The goal was to counter the deflation which was paralyzing the economy.

Roosevelt tried to keep his campaign promise by cutting the federal budget. This included a reduction in military spending from $752 million in 1932 to $531 million in 1934 and a 40% cut in spending on veterans benefits. 500,000 veterans and widows were removed from the pension rolls, and benefits were reduced for the remainder. Federal salaries were cut and spending on research and education was reduced. The veterans were well organized and strongly protested, so most benefits were restored or increased by 1934. Veterans groups such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars won their campaign to transform their benefits from payments due in 1945 to immediate cash when Congress overrode the President&#x27;s veto and passed the Bonus Act in January 1936. It pumped sums equal to 2% of the GDP into the consumer economy and had a major stimulus effect.

====Second New Deal (1935–1936)====

Roosevelt expected that his party would lose seats in the 1934 Congressional elections, as the president&#x27;s party had done in most previous midterm elections; the Democrats gained seats instead. Empowered by the public&#x27;s vote of confidence, the first item on Roosevelt&#x27;s agenda in the 74th Congress was the creation of a social insurance program. The Social Security Act established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly, the poor, and the sick. Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund, saying, &quot;We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program.&quot; Compared with the social security systems in Western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative. But for the first time, the federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children, and disabled people. Against Roosevelt&#x27;s original intention for universal coverage, the act excluded farmers, domestic workers, and other groups, which made up about forty percent of the labor force.

Roosevelt consolidated the various relief organizations, though some, like the PWA, continued to exist. After winning Congressional authorization for further funding of relief efforts, he established the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, the WPA employed over three million people in its first year of operations. It undertook numerous massive construction projects in cooperation with local governments. It also set up the National Youth Administration and arts organizations.

The National Labor Relations Act guaranteed workers the right to collective bargaining through unions of their own choice. The act also established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and suppress repeated labor disturbances. The act did not compel employers to reach an agreement with their employees, but it opened possibilities for American labor. The result was a tremendous growth of membership in the labor unions, especially in the mass-production sector. When the Flint sit-down strike threatened the production of General Motors, Roosevelt broke with the precedent set by many former presidents and refused to intervene; the strike ultimately led to the unionization of both General Motors and its rivals in the American automobile industry.

While the First New Deal of 1933 had broad support from most sectors, the Second New Deal challenged the business community. Conservative Democrats, led by Al Smith, fought back with the American Liberty League, savagely attacking Roosevelt and equating him with socialism. But Smith overplayed his hand, and his boisterous rhetoric let Roosevelt isolate his opponents and identify them with the wealthy vested interests that opposed the New Deal, strengthening Roosevelt for the 1936 landslide. By contrast, labor unions, energized by labor legislation, signed up millions of new members and became a major backer of Roosevelt&#x27;s re-elections in 1936, 1940, and 1944.

Burns suggests that Roosevelt&#x27;s policy decisions were guided more by pragmatism than ideology and that he &quot;was like the general of a guerrilla army whose columns, fighting blindly in the mountains through dense ravines and thickets, suddenly converge, half by plan and half by coincidence, and debouch into the plain below.&quot; Roosevelt argued that such apparently haphazard methodology was necessary. &quot;The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It is common sense to take a method and try it; if it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.&quot;

====Election of 1936====

Eight million workers remained unemployed in 1936, and though economic conditions had improved since 1932, they remained sluggish. By 1936, Roosevelt had lost the backing he once held in the business community because of his support for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Social Security Act. The Republicans had few alternative candidates and nominated Kansas Governor Alf Landon, a little-known bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public re-emergence of the still-unpopular Herbert Hoover. While Roosevelt campaigned on his New Deal programs and continued to attack Hoover, Landon sought to win voters who approved of the goals of the New Deal but disagreed with its implementation.

An attempt by Louisiana Senator Huey Long to organize a left-wing third party collapsed after Long&#x27;s assassination in 1935. The remnants, helped by Father Charles Coughlin, supported William Lemke of the newly formed Union Party. Roosevelt won re-nomination with little opposition at the 1936 Democratic National Convention, while his allies overcame Southern resistance to abolish the long-established rule that required Democratic presidential candidates to win the votes of two-thirds of the delegates rather than a simple majority.

In the election against Landon and a third-party candidate, Roosevelt won 60.8% of the vote and carried every state except Maine and Vermont. The Democratic ticket won the highest proportion of the popular vote. Democrats expanded their majorities in Congress, controlling over three-quarters of the seats in each house. The election also saw the consolidation of the New Deal coalition; while the Democrats lost some of their traditional allies in big business, they were replaced by groups such as organized labor and African Americans, the latter of whom voted Democratic for the first time since the Civil War. Roosevelt lost high-income voters, especially businessmen and professionals, but made major gains among the poor and minorities. He won 86 percent of the Jewish vote, 81 percent of Catholics, 80 percent of union members, 76 percent of Southerners, 76 percent of blacks in northern cities, and 75 percent of people on relief. Roosevelt carried 102 of the country&#x27;s 106 cities with a population of 100,000 or more.

====Supreme Court fight and second term legislation====
The Supreme Court became Roosevelt&#x27;s primary domestic focus during his second term after the court overturned many of his programs, including NIRA. The more conservative members of the court upheld the principles of the Lochner era, which saw numerous economic regulations struck down on the basis of freedom of contract. Roosevelt proposed the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have allowed him to appoint an additional Justice for each incumbent Justice over the age of 70; in 1937, there were six Supreme Court Justices over the age of 70. The size of the Court had been set at nine since the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1869, and Congress had altered the number of Justices six other times throughout U.S. history. Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;court packing&quot; plan ran into intense political opposition from his own party, led by Vice President Garner since it upset the separation of powers. A bipartisan coalition of liberals and conservatives of both parties opposed the bill, and Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes broke with precedent by publicly advocating the defeat of the bill. Any chance of passing the bill ended with the death of Senate Majority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson in July 1937.

Starting with the 1937 case of &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot;, the court began to take a more favorable view of economic regulations. Historians have described this as, &quot;the switch in time that saved nine&quot;. That same year, Roosevelt appointed a Supreme Court Justice for the first time, and by 1941, had appointed seven of the court&#x27;s nine justices. After &quot;Parrish&quot;, the Court shifted its focus from judicial review of economic regulations to the protection of civil liberties. Four of Roosevelt&#x27;s Supreme Court appointees, Felix Frankfurter, Robert H. Jackson,
Hugo Black, and William O. Douglas, were particularly influential in reshaping the jurisprudence of the Court.

With Roosevelt&#x27;s influence on the wane following the failure of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, conservative Democrats joined with Republicans to block the implementation of further New Deal programs. Roosevelt did manage to pass some legislation, including the Housing Act of 1937, a second Agricultural Adjustment Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, which was the last major piece of New Deal legislation. The FLSA outlawed child labor, established a federal minimum wage, and required overtime pay for certain employees who work in excess of forty hours per week. He also passed the Reorganization Act of 1939 and subsequently created the Executive Office of the President, making it &quot;the nerve center of the federal administrative system&quot;. When the economy began to deteriorate again in mid-1937, Roosevelt launched a rhetorical campaign against big business and monopoly power, alleging that the recession was the result of a capital strike and even ordering the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look for a criminal conspiracy (they found none). He then asked Congress for $5 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in relief and public works funding. This created as many as 3.3 million WPA jobs by 1938. Projects accomplished under the WPA ranged from new federal courthouses and post offices to facilities and infrastructure for national parks, bridges, and other infrastructure across the country, and architectural surveys and archaeological excavations—investments to construct facilities and preserve important resources. Beyond this, however, Roosevelt recommended to a special congressional session only a permanent national farm act, administrative reorganization, and regional planning measures, all of which were leftovers from a regular session. According to Burns, this attempt illustrated Roosevelt&#x27;s inability to settle on a basic economic program.

Determined to overcome the opposition of conservative Democrats in Congress, Roosevelt became involved in the 1938 Democratic primaries, actively campaigning for challengers who were more supportive of New Deal reform. Roosevelt failed badly, managing to defeat only one of the ten targeted. In the November 1938 elections, Democrats lost six Senate seats and 71 House seats, with losses concentrated among pro-New Deal Democrats. When Congress reconvened in 1939, Republicans under Senator Robert Taft formed a Conservative coalition with Southern Democrats, virtually ending Roosevelt&#x27;s ability to enact his domestic proposals. Despite their opposition to Roosevelt&#x27;s domestic policies, many of these conservative Congressmen would provide crucial support for his foreign policy before and during World War II.

====Conservation and the environment====

Roosevelt had a lifelong interest in the environment and conservation starting with his youthful interest in forestry on his family estate. Although he was never an outdoorsman or sportsman on Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s scale, his growth of the national systems was comparable. When Franklin was Governor of New York, the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration was essentially a state-level predecessor of the federal Civilian Conservation Corps, with 10,000 or more men building fire trails, combating soil erosion and planting tree seedlings in marginal farmland in New York. As President, Roosevelt was active in expanding, funding, and promoting the National Park and National Forest systems. Their popularity soared, from three million visitors a year at the start of the decade to 15.5 million in 1939. The Civilian Conservation Corps enrolled 3.4 million young men and built of trails, planted two billion trees, and upgraded of dirt roads. Every state had its own state parks, and Roosevelt made sure that WPA and CCC projects were set up to upgrade them as well as the national systems.

====GNP and unemployment rates====

Government spending increased from 8.0% of the gross national product (GNP) under Hoover in 1932 to 10.2% in 1936. The national debt as a percentage of the GNP had more than doubled under Hoover from 16% to 40% of the GNP in early 1933. It held steady at close to 40% as late as fall 1941, then grew rapidly during the war. The GNP was 34% higher in 1936 than in 1932 and 58% higher in 1940 on the eve of war. That is, the economy grew 58% from 1932 to 1940, and then grew 56% from 1940 to 1945 in five years of wartime. Unemployment fell dramatically during Roosevelt&#x27;s first term. It increased in 1938 (&quot;a depression within a depression&quot;) but continually declined after 1938. Total employment during Roosevelt&#x27;s term expanded by 18.31 million jobs, with an average annual increase in jobs during his administration of 5.3%.

====Foreign policy (1933–1941)====

The main foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt&#x27;s first term was the Good Neighbor Policy, which was a re-evaluation of U.S. policy toward Latin America. The United States frequently intervened in Latin America following the promulgation of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, and occupied several Latin American nations during the Banana Wars that occurred following the Spanish–American War of 1898. After Roosevelt took office, he withdrew U.S. forces from Haiti and reached new treaties with Cuba and Panama, ending their status as U.S. protectorates. In December 1933, Roosevelt signed the Montevideo Convention, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries. Roosevelt also normalized relations with the Soviet Union, which the United States had refused to recognize since the 1920s. He hoped to renegotiate the Russian debt from World War I and open trade relations, but no progress was made on either issue and &quot;both nations were soon disillusioned by the accord.&quot;

The rejection of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919–1920 marked the dominance of non-interventionism in American foreign policy. Despite Roosevelt&#x27;s Wilsonian background, he and Secretary of State Cordell Hull acted with great care not to provoke isolationist sentiment. The isolationist movement was bolstered in the early to mid-1930s by Senator Gerald Nye and others who succeeded in their effort to stop the &quot;merchants of death&quot; in the U.S. from selling arms abroad. This effort took the form of the Neutrality Acts; the president was refused a provision he requested giving him the discretion to allow the sale of arms to victims of aggression. He largely acquiesced to Congress&#x27;s non-interventionist policies in the early-to-mid 1930s. In the interim, Fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini proceeded to overcome Ethiopia, and the Italians joined Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler in supporting General Francisco Franco and the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. As that conflict drew to a close in early 1939, Roosevelt expressed regret in not aiding the Spanish Republicans. When Japan invaded China in 1937, isolationism limited Roosevelt&#x27;s ability to aid China, despite atrocities like the Nanking Massacre and the USS &quot;Panay&quot; incident.


Germany annexed Austria in 1938, and soon turned its attention to its eastern neighbors. Roosevelt made it clear that, in the event of German aggression against Czechoslovakia, the U.S. would remain neutral. After completion of the Munich Agreement and the execution of Kristallnacht, American public opinion turned against Germany, and Roosevelt began preparing for a possible war with Germany. Relying on an interventionist political coalition of Southern Democrats and business-oriented Republicans, Roosevelt oversaw the expansion of U.S. airpower and war production capacity.

When World War II began in September 1939 with Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland and Britain and France&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany, Roosevelt sought ways to assist Britain and France militarily. Isolationist leaders like Charles Lindbergh and Senator William Borah successfully mobilized opposition to Roosevelt&#x27;s proposed repeal of the Neutrality Act, but Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the sale of arms on a cash-and-carry basis. He also began a regular secret correspondence with Britain&#x27;s First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, in September 1939—the first of 1,700 letters and telegrams between them. Roosevelt forged a close personal relationship with Churchill, who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in May 1940.

The Fall of France in June 1940 shocked the American public, and isolationist sentiment declined. In July 1940, Roosevelt appointed two interventionist Republican leaders, Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox, as Secretaries of War and the Navy, respectively. Both parties gave support to his plans for a rapid build-up of the American military, but the isolationists warned that Roosevelt would get the nation into an unnecessary war with Germany. In July 1940, a group of Congressmen introduced a bill that would authorize the nation&#x27;s first peacetime draft, and with the support of the Roosevelt administration, the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 passed in September. The size of the army increased from 189,000 men at the end of 1939 to 1.4 million in mid-1941. In September 1940, Roosevelt openly defied the Neutrality Acts by reaching the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, which, in exchange for military base rights in the British Caribbean Islands, gave 50 American destroyers to Britain.

====Election of 1940====
In the months prior to the July 1940 Democratic National Convention, there was much speculation as to whether Roosevelt would run for an unprecedented third term. The two-term tradition, although not yet enshrined in the Constitution, had been established by George Washington when he refused to run for a third term in 1796. Roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement, and he even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as James Farley, that he would not run for a third term and that they could seek the Democratic nomination. Farley and Vice President John Garner were not pleased with Roosevelt when he ultimately made the decision to break from Washington&#x27;s precedent. As Germany swept through Western Europe and menaced Britain in mid-1940, Roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the Nazi threat. He was aided by the party&#x27;s political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat Wendell Willkie, the popular Republican nominee.

At the July 1940 Democratic Convention in Chicago, Roosevelt easily swept aside challenges from Farley and Vice President Garner, who had turned against Roosevelt in his second term because of his liberal economic and social policies. To replace Garner on the ticket, Roosevelt turned to Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace of Iowa, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal and was popular in farm states. The choice was strenuously opposed by many of the party&#x27;s conservatives, who felt Wallace was too radical and &quot;eccentric&quot; in his private life. But Roosevelt insisted that without Wallace on the ticket he would decline re-nomination, and Wallace won the vice-presidential nomination, defeating Speaker of the House William B. Bankhead and other candidates.

A late August poll taken by Gallup found the race to be essentially tied, but Roosevelt&#x27;s popularity surged in September following the announcement of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. Willkie supported much of the New Deal as well as rearmament and aid to Britain but warned that Roosevelt would drag the country into another European war. Responding to Willkie&#x27;s attacks, Roosevelt promised to keep the country out of the war. Over its last month, the campaign degenerated into a series of outrageous accusations and mud-slinging by the parties. Roosevelt won the 1940 election with 55% of the popular vote, 38 of the 48 states, and almost 85% of the electoral vote.

===Third and fourth terms (1941–1945)===
World War II dominated Roosevelt&#x27;s attention, with far more time devoted to world affairs than ever before. Domestic politics and relations with Congress were largely shaped by his efforts to achieve total mobilization of the nation&#x27;s economic, financial, and institutional resources for the war effort. Even relationships with Latin America and Canada were structured by wartime demands. Roosevelt maintained close personal control of all major diplomatic and military decisions, working closely with his generals and admirals, the war and Navy departments, the British, and even the Soviet Union. His key advisors on diplomacy were Harry Hopkins in the White House, Sumner Welles in the State Department, and Henry Morgenthau Jr. at Treasury. In military affairs, Roosevelt worked most closely with Secretary Henry L. Stimson at the War Department, Army Chief of Staff George Marshall, and Admiral William D. Leahy.

====Lead-up to the war====
By late 1940, re-armament was in high gear, partly to expand and re-equip the Army and Navy and partly to become the &quot;Arsenal of Democracy&quot; for Britain and other countries. With his Four Freedoms speech in January 1941, which proposed four fundamental freedoms that people &quot;everywhere in the world&quot; ought to enjoy: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear, Roosevelt laid out the case for an Allied battle for basic rights throughout the world. Assisted by Willkie, Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the Lend-Lease program, which directed massive military and economic aid to Britain and China. In sharp contrast to the loans of World War I, there would be no repayment. As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against Japan, Germany, and Italy, American isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh and the America First Committee vehemently attacked Roosevelt as an irresponsible warmonger. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Roosevelt agreed to extend Lend-Lease to the Soviets. Thus, Roosevelt had committed the U.S. to the Allied side with a policy of &quot;all aid short of war&quot;. By July 1941, Roosevelt authorized the creation of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to counter perceived propaganda efforts in Latin America by Germany and Italy.

In August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill conducted a secret bilateral meeting in which they drafted the Atlantic Charter, conceptually outlining global wartime and postwar goals. This would be the first of several wartime conferences; Churchill and Roosevelt would meet ten more times in person. Though Churchill pressed for an American declaration of war against Germany, Roosevelt believed that Congress would reject any attempt to bring the U.S. into the war. In September, a German submarine fired on the U.S. destroyer &quot;Greer&quot;, and Roosevelt declared that the U.S. Navy would assume an escort role for Allied convoys in the Atlantic as far east as Britain and would fire upon German ships or U-boats of the Kriegsmarine if they entered the U.S. Navy zone. This &quot;shoot on sight&quot; policy brought the U.S. Navy into direct conflict with German submarines and was favored by Americans by a margin of 2-to-1.

====Pearl Harbor and declarations of war====

After the German invasion of Poland, the primary concern of both Roosevelt and his top military staff was on the war in Europe, but Japan also presented foreign policy challenges. Relations with Japan had continually deteriorated since its invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and worsened further with Roosevelt&#x27;s support of China. After Roosevelt announced a $100 million loan (equivalent to $ billion in ) to China in reaction to Japan&#x27;s occupation of northern French Indochina, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy; Germany, Japan, and Italy became known as the Axis powers. In July 1941, after Japan occupied the remainder of French Indochina, Roosevelt cut off the sale of oil to Japan, depriving Japan of more than 95 percent of its oil supply. He also placed the Philippine military under American command and reinstated General Douglas MacArthur into active duty to command U.S. forces in the Philippines.

The Japanese were incensed by the embargo and Japanese leaders became determined to attack the United States unless it lifted the embargo. The Roosevelt administration was unwilling to reverse the policy, and Secretary of State Hull blocked a potential summit between Roosevelt and Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. After diplomatic efforts failed, the Privy Council of Japan authorized a strike against the United States. The Japanese believed that the destruction of the United States Asiatic Fleet (stationed in the Philippines) and the United States Pacific Fleet (stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii) was vital to the conquest of Southeast Asia. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, knocking out the main American battleship fleet and killing 2,403 American servicemen and civilians. At the same time, separate Japanese task forces attacked Thailand, British Hong Kong, the Philippines, and other targets. Roosevelt called for war in his &quot;Infamy Speech&quot; to Congress, in which he said: &quot;Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.&quot; In a nearly unanimous vote, Congress declared war on Japan. After Pearl Harbor, antiwar sentiment in the United States largely evaporated overnight. On December 11, 1941, Hitler and Mussolini declared war on the United States, which responded in kind.

A majority of scholars have rejected the conspiracy theories that Roosevelt, or any other high government officials, knew in advance about the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese had kept their secrets closely guarded, so it is unlikely that American officials were aware of Japanese plans for a surprise attack on the Pacific Fleet. Senior American officials were aware that war was imminent, but they did not expect an attack on Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt assumed that the Japanese would attack either the Dutch East Indies or Thailand.

====War plans====
In late December 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met at the Arcadia Conference, which established a joint strategy between the U.S. and Britain. Both agreed on a Europe first strategy that prioritized the defeat of Germany before Japan. The U.S. and Britain established the Combined Chiefs of Staff to coordinate military policy and the Combined Munitions Assignments Board to coordinate the allocation of supplies. An agreement was also reached to establish a centralized command in the Pacific theater called ABDA, named for the American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces in the theater. On January 1, 1942, the United States and the other Allied Powers issued the Declaration by United Nations, in which each nation pledged to defeat the Axis powers.

In 1942, Roosevelt formed a new body, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which made the final decisions on American military strategy. Admiral Ernest J. King as Chief of Naval Operations commanded the Navy and Marines, while General George C. Marshall led the Army and was in nominal control of the Air Force, which in practice was commanded by General Hap Arnold. The Joint Chiefs were chaired by Admiral William D. Leahy, the most senior officer in the military. Roosevelt avoided micromanaging the war and let his top military officers make most decisions. Roosevelt&#x27;s civilian appointees handled the draft and procurement of men and equipment, but no civilians—not even the secretaries of War or Navy—had a voice in strategy. Roosevelt avoided the State Department and conducted high-level diplomacy through his aides, especially Harry Hopkins, whose influence was bolstered by his control of the Lend-Lease funds.

====Nuclear program====
In August 1939, Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein sent the Einstein–Szilárd letter to Roosevelt, warning of the possibility of a German project to develop nuclear weapons. Szilard realized that the recently discovered process of nuclear fission could be used to create a weapon of mass destruction. Roosevelt feared the consequences of allowing Germany to have sole possession of the technology and authorized preliminary research into nuclear weapons. After Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt administration secured funding to continue research and selected General Leslie Groves to oversee the Manhattan Project, which was charged with developing the first nuclear weapons. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to jointly pursue the project, and Roosevelt helped ensure that American scientists cooperated with their British counterparts.

====Wartime conferences====


Roosevelt coined the term &quot;Four Policemen&quot; to refer to the &quot;Big Four&quot; Allied powers of World War II: the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China. The &quot;Big Three&quot; of Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, together with Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, cooperated informally on a plan in which American and British troops concentrated in the West; Soviet troops fought on the Eastern front; and Chinese, British and American troops fought in Asia and the Pacific. The United States also continued to send aid via the Lend-Lease program to the Soviet Union and other countries. The Allies formulated strategy in a series of high-profile conferences as well as by contact through diplomatic and military channels. Beginning in May 1942, the Soviets urged an Anglo-American invasion of German-occupied France to divert troops from the Eastern front. Concerned that their forces were not yet ready, Churchill and Roosevelt decided to delay such an invasion until at least 1943 and instead focus on a landing in North Africa, known as Operation Torch.

In November 1943, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met to discuss strategy and post-war plans at the Tehran Conference, where Roosevelt met Stalin for the first time. Britain and the United States committed to opening a second front against Germany in 1944, while Stalin committed to entering the war against Japan at an unspecified date. Subsequent conferences at Bretton Woods and Dumbarton Oaks established the framework for the post-war international monetary system and the United Nations, an intergovernmental organization similar to the failed League of Nations. Taking up the Wilsonian mantle, Roosevelt pushed the establishment of the United Nations as his highest postwar priority. Roosevelt expected it would be controlled by Washington, Moscow, London and Beijing, and would resolve all major world problems.

Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met for a second time at the February 1945 Yalta Conference in Crimea. With the end of the war in Europe approaching, Roosevelt&#x27;s primary focus was convincing Stalin to enter the war against Japan; the Joint Chiefs had estimated that an American invasion of Japan would cause as many as one million American casualties. In return, the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island. The three leaders agreed to hold a conference in 1945 to establish the United Nations, and they also agreed on the structure of the United Nations Security Council, which would be charged with ensuring international security. Roosevelt did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland, but he won the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe, which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany. Germany itself would not be dismembered but would be jointly occupied by the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Against Soviet pressure, Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to impose huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after the war. Roosevelt&#x27;s role in the Yalta Conference has been controversial; critics charge that he naively trusted the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, while supporters argue that there was little more that Roosevelt could have done for the Eastern European countries given the Soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union.

====Course of the war====
The Allies invaded French North Africa in November 1942, securing the surrender of Vichy French forces within days of landing. At the January 1943 Casablanca Conference, the Allies agreed to defeat Axis forces in North Africa and then launch an invasion of Sicily, with an attack on France to take place in 1944. At the conference, Roosevelt also announced that he would only accept the unconditional surrender of Germany, Japan, and Italy. In February 1943, the Soviet Union won a major victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, and in May 1943, the Allies secured the surrender of over 250,000 German and Italian soldiers in North Africa, ending the North African Campaign. The Allies launched an invasion of Sicily in July 1943, capturing the island the following month. In September 1943, the Allies secured an armistice from Italian prime minister Pietro Badoglio, but Germany quickly restored Mussolini to power. The Allied invasion of mainland Italy commenced in September 1943, but the Italian Campaign continued until 1945 as German and Italian troops resisted the Allied advance.

To command the invasion of France, Roosevelt chose General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had successfully commanded a multinational coalition in North Africa and Sicily. Eisenhower launched Operation Overlord on June 6, 1944. Supported by 12,000 aircraft and the largest naval force ever assembled, the Allies successfully established a beachhead in Normandy and then advanced further into France. Though reluctant to back an unelected government, Roosevelt recognized Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Provisional Government of the French Republic as the de facto government of France in July 1944. After most of France had been liberated, Roosevelt granted formal recognition to de Gaulle&#x27;s government in October 1944. Over the following months, the Allies liberated more territory and began the invasion of Germany. By April 1945, Nazi resistance was crumbling in the face of advances by both the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.

In the opening weeks of the war, Japan conquered the Philippines and the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia. The Japanese advance reached its maximum extent by June 1942, when the U.S. Navy scored a decisive victory at the Battle of Midway. American and Australian forces then began a slow and costly strategy called island hopping or leapfrogging through the Pacific Islands, with the objective of gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan could ultimately be invaded. In contrast to Hitler, Roosevelt took no direct part in the tactical naval operations, though he approved strategic decisions. Roosevelt gave way in part to insistent demands from the public and Congress that more effort be devoted against Japan, but he always insisted on Germany first. The strength of the Japanese navy was decimated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and by April 1945 the Allies had re-captured much of their lost territory in the Pacific.

====Home front====
The home front was subject to dynamic social changes throughout the war, though domestic issues were no longer Roosevelt&#x27;s most urgent policy concern. The military buildup spurred economic growth. Unemployment fell from 7.7 million in spring 1940 to 3.4 million in fall 1941 and to 1.5 million in fall 1942, out of a labor force of 54 million. There was a growing labor shortage, accelerating the second wave of the Great Migration of African Americans, farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers. African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry. To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 Roosevelt proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when the proposal failed, he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded. The Revenue Act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the excess profits tax), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first federal withholding tax. In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation to tax all &quot;unreasonable&quot; profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10 billion in revenue for the war and other government measures. Congress overrode Roosevelt&#x27;s veto to pass a smaller revenue bill raising $2 billion.

In 1942, war production increased dramatically but fell short of Roosevelt&#x27;s goals, due in part to manpower shortages. The effort was also hindered by numerous strikes, especially in the coal mining and railroad industries, which lasted well into 1944. Nonetheless, between 1941 and 1945, the United States produced 2.4 million trucks, 300,000 military aircraft, 88,400 tanks, and 40 billion rounds of ammunition. The production capacity of the United States dwarfed that of other countries; for example, in 1944, the United States produced more military aircraft than the combined production of Germany, Japan, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The White House became the ultimate site for labor mediation, conciliation or arbitration. One particular battle royale occurred between Vice President Wallace, who headed the Board of Economic Warfare, and Jesse H. Jones, in charge of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation; both agencies assumed responsibility for the acquisition of rubber supplies and came to loggerheads over funding. Roosevelt resolved the dispute by dissolving both agencies. In 1943, Roosevelt established the Office of War Mobilization to oversee the home front; the agency was led by James F. Byrnes, who came to be known as the &quot;assistant president&quot; due to his influence.

Roosevelt&#x27;s 1944 State of the Union Address advocated that Americans should think of basic economic rights as a Second Bill of Rights. He stated that all Americans should have the right to &quot;adequate medical care&quot;, &quot;a good education&quot;, &quot;a decent home&quot;, and a &quot;useful and remunerative job&quot;. In the most ambitious domestic proposal of his third term, Roosevelt proposed the G.I. Bill, which would create a massive benefits program for returning soldiers. Benefits included post-secondary education, medical care, unemployment insurance, job counseling, and low-cost loans for homes and businesses. The G.I. Bill passed unanimously in both houses of Congress and was signed into law in June 1944. Of the fifteen million Americans who served in World War II, more than half benefitted from the educational opportunities provided for in the G.I. Bill.

Towards the end of his presidency, Roosevelt supported the idea of forming a new liberal party with former liberal Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie (who himself put forward this proposal), believing that there should be two ideologically distinct parties in America; one liberal and one conservative.
====Declining health====
Roosevelt, a chain-smoker throughout his adult life, had been in declining health since at least 1940. In March 1944, shortly after his 62nd birthday, he underwent testing at Bethesda Hospital and was found to have hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease causing angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure.

Hospital physicians and two outside specialists ordered Roosevelt to rest. His personal physician, Admiral Ross McIntire, created a daily schedule that banned business guests for lunch and incorporated two hours of rest daily. During the 1944 re-election campaign, McIntire denied several times that Roosevelt&#x27;s health was poor; on October 12, for example, he announced that &quot;The President&#x27;s health is perfectly OK. There are absolutely no organic difficulties at all.&quot; Roosevelt realized that his declining health could eventually make it impossible for him to continue as president, and in 1945 he told a confidant that he might resign from the presidency following the end of the war.

====Election of 1944====

While some Democrats had opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination in 1940, the president faced little difficulty in securing his re-nomination at the 1944 Democratic National Convention. Roosevelt made it clear before the convention that he was seeking another term, and on the lone presidential ballot of the convention, Roosevelt won the vast majority of delegates, although a minority of Southern Democrats voted for Harry F. Byrd. Party leaders prevailed upon Roosevelt to drop Vice President Wallace from the ticket, believing him to be an electoral liability and a poor potential successor in case of Roosevelt&#x27;s death. Roosevelt preferred Byrnes as Wallace&#x27;s replacement but was convinced to support Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of war production inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the party. On the second vice presidential ballot of the convention, Truman defeated Wallace to win the nomination.

The Republicans nominated Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York, who had a reputation as a liberal in his party. They accused the Roosevelt administration of domestic corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency, but Dewey&#x27;s most effective gambit was to raise discreetly the age issue. He assailed the President as a &quot;tired old man&quot; with &quot;tired old men&quot; in his cabinet, pointedly suggesting that the President&#x27;s lack of vigor had produced a less than vigorous economic recovery. Roosevelt, as most observers could see from his weight loss and haggard appearance, was a tired man in 1944. But upon entering the campaign in earnest in late September 1944, Roosevelt displayed enough passion to allay most concerns and deflect Republican attacks. With the war still raging, he urged voters not to &quot;change horses in mid-stream&quot;. Labor unions, which had grown rapidly in the war, fully supported Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Truman won the 1944 election, defeating Dewey and his running mate John W. Bricker with 53.4% of the popular vote and 432 out of the 531 electoral votes. The president campaigned in favor of a strong United Nations, so his victory symbolized support for the nation&#x27;s future participation in the international community.

====Final months and death====
When Roosevelt returned to the United States from the Yalta Conference, many were shocked to see how old, thin and frail he looked. He spoke while seated in the well of the House, an unprecedented concession to his physical incapacity. During March 1945, he sent strongly worded messages to Stalin accusing him of breaking his Yalta commitments over Poland, Germany, prisoners of war and other issues. When Stalin accused the Western Allies of plotting behind his back a separate peace with Hitler, Roosevelt replied: &quot;I cannot avoid a feeling of bitter resentment towards your informers, whoever they are, for such vile misrepresentations of my actions or those of my trusted subordinates.&quot; On March 29, 1945, Roosevelt departed for the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest before his anticipated appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations.

In the afternoon of April 12, 1945, in Warm Springs, Georgia, while sitting for a portrait by Elizabeth Shoumatoff, Roosevelt said: &quot;I have a terrific headache.&quot; He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president&#x27;s attending cardiologist, Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive intracerebral hemorrhage. At 3:35 p.m., Roosevelt died at the age of 63.

The following morning, Roosevelt&#x27;s body was placed in a flag-draped coffin and loaded onto the &quot;Ferdinand Magellan&quot; presidential train for the trip back to Washington. Due to the U.S. still being in a state of war, a state funeral was deemed inappropriate and a smaller ceremony was opted for instead. Despite this, thousands flocked to the route to pay their respects.

Rather than lying in state at the United States Capitol as per tradition, Roosevelt&#x27;s remains were placed in the White House East Room where, on April 14, a simple funeral service was held that was attended by his family, high government officials, and foreign ambassadors. Roosevelt was then transported by train from Washington to his birthplace at Hyde Park. On April 15 he was buried, per his wish, in the rose garden of his Springwood estate.

Roosevelt&#x27;s declining physical health had been kept secret from the public. His death was met with shock and grief across the world. Germany surrendered during the 30-day mourning period, but Harry Truman (who had succeeded Roosevelt as president) ordered flags to remain at half-staff; he also dedicated Victory in Europe Day and its celebrations to Roosevelt&#x27;s memory. World War II ended with the signed surrender of Japan in September.

==Civil rights, repatriation, internment, and the Holocaust==

Roosevelt was viewed as a hero by many African Americans, Catholics, and Jews, and he was highly successful in attracting large majorities of these voters into his New Deal coalition. From his first term until 1939, the Mexican Repatriation started by President Herbert Hoover continued under Roosevelt, which scholars today contend was a form of ethnic cleansing towards Mexican Americans. Roosevelt ended federal involvement in the deportations. After 1934, deportations fell by approximately 50 percent. However, Roosevelt did not attempt to suppress the deportations on a local or state level. Mexican Americans were the only group explicitly excluded from New Deal benefits. The deprival of due process for Mexican Americans is cited as a precedent for Roosevelt&#x27;s internment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II. Roosevelt won strong support from Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans, but not Japanese Americans, as he presided over their internment during the war. African Americans and Native Americans fared well in two New Deal relief programs, the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Indian Reorganization Act, respectively. Sitkoff reports that the WPA &quot;provided an economic floor for the whole black community in the 1930s, rivaling both agriculture and domestic service as the chief source&quot; of income.

===Lynching and civil rights===
In contrast to Presidents Harding and Coolidge, Roosevelt stopped short of joining NAACP leaders in pushing for federal anti-lynching legislation. He asserted that such legislation was unlikely to pass and that his support for it would alienate Southern congressmen, though by 1940 even his conservative Texan vice-president, Garner, supported federal action against lynching.

Roosevelt did not appoint or nominate a single African American as secretary or assistant secretary to his cabinet. About one hundred African Americans met informally, however, to provide the administration with advice on issues related to African Americans. Although sometimes described as a &quot;Black Cabinet&quot;, Roosevelt never officially acknowledged it as such nor did he make &quot;appointments&quot; to it.

First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt vocally supported efforts designed to aid the African American community, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, which helped boost wages for nonwhite workers in the South. In 1941, Roosevelt established the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) to implement Executive Order 8802, which prohibited racial and religious discrimination in employment among defense contractors. The FEPC was the first national program directed against employment discrimination, and it played a major role in opening up new employment opportunities to nonwhite workers. During World War II, the proportion of African American men employed in manufacturing positions rose significantly. In response to Roosevelt&#x27;s policies, African Americans increasingly defected from the Republican Party during the 1930s and 1940s, becoming an important Democratic voting bloc in several Northern states.

===Japanese Americans===
The attack on Pearl Harbor raised concerns among the public regarding the possibility of sabotage by Japanese Americans. This suspicion was fed by long-standing racism against Japanese immigrants and the findings of the Roberts Commission, which concluded that the attack on Pearl Harbor had been assisted by Japanese spies. On February 19, 1942, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which relocated 110,000 Japanese-American citizens and immigrants, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast. They were forced to liquidate their properties and businesses and interned in hastily built camps in interior, harsh locations.

Roosevelt delegated the decision for internment to Secretary of War Stimson, who in turn relied on the judgment of Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the executive order in the 1944 case of &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;. A much smaller number of German and Italian citizens were arrested or placed into internment camps. Unlike Japanese Americans, however, they were not sent to them on the sole basis of racial ancestry.

===The Holocaust===
There is controversy among historians about Roosevelt&#x27;s attitude to Jews and the Holocaust. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. says Roosevelt &quot;did what he could do&quot; to help Jews; David Wyman says Roosevelt&#x27;s record on Jewish refugees and their rescue is &quot;very poor&quot; and one of the worst failures of his presidency. In 1923, as a member of the Harvard University board of directors, Roosevelt decided there were too many Jewish students at Harvard and helped institute a quota to limit the number of Jews admitted. After Kristallnacht in 1938, Roosevelt had his ambassador to Germany recalled to Washington. He did not loosen immigration quotas but did allow German Jews already in the U.S. on visas to stay indefinitely. According to Rafael Medoff, Roosevelt could have saved 190,000 Jewish lives by telling his State Department to fill immigration quotas to the legal limit, but his administration discouraged and disqualified Jewish refugees based on its prohibitive requirements that left less than 25% of the quotas filled.

Adolf Hitler chose to implement the &quot;Final Solution&quot;—the extermination of the European Jewish population—by January 1942, and American officials learned of the scale of the Nazi extermination campaign in the following months. Against the objections of the State Department, Roosevelt convinced the other Allied leaders to issue the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations, which condemned the ongoing Holocaust and warned to try its perpetrators as war criminals. In 1943, Roosevelt told U.S. government officials that there should be limits on Jews in various professions to &quot;eliminate the specific and understandable complaints which the Germans bore towards the Jews in Germany.&quot; The same year, Roosevelt was personally briefed by Polish Home Army intelligence agent Jan Karski who was an eyewitness of the Holocaust; pleading for action, Karski told him that 1.8 million Jews had already been exterminated. Karski recalled that Roosevelt &quot;did not ask one question about the Jews&quot;. In January 1944, Roosevelt established the War Refugee Board to aid Jews and other victims of Axis atrocities. Aside from these actions, Roosevelt believed that the best way to help the persecuted populations of Europe was to end the war as quickly as possible. Top military leaders and War Department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the extermination camps or the rail lines leading to them, fearing it would be a diversion from the war effort. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith, there is no evidence that anyone ever proposed such a campaign to Roosevelt.

==Legacy==
===Historical reputation===
Roosevelt is widely considered to be one of the most important figures in U.S. history, and one of the most influential figures of the 20th century. Historians and political scientists consistently rank Roosevelt, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln as the three greatest presidents, although the order varies. Reflecting on Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency, &quot;which brought the United States through the Great Depression and World War II to a prosperous future&quot;, biographer Jean Edward Smith said in 2007, &quot;He lifted himself from a wheelchair to lift the nation from its knees.&quot;

His commitment to the working class and unemployed in need of relief in the nation&#x27;s longest recession made him a favorite of blue-collar workers, labor unions, and ethnic minorities. The rapid expansion of government programs that occurred during Roosevelt&#x27;s term redefined the role of government in the United States, and Roosevelt&#x27;s advocacy for government social programs was instrumental in redefining liberalism for coming generations. Roosevelt firmly established U.S. leadership on the world stage with his role in shaping and financing World War II. His isolationist critics faded away, and even the Republicans joined in his overall policies. He also permanently increased the power of the president at the expense of Congress.

His Second Bill of Rights became, according to historian Joshua Zeitz, &quot;the basis of the Democratic Party&#x27;s aspirations for the better part of four decades&quot;. After his death, Eleanor continued to be a forceful presence in U.S. and world politics, serving as delegate to the conference which established the United Nations and championing civil rights and liberalism generally. Some junior New Dealers played leading roles in the presidencies of Truman, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Kennedy came from a Roosevelt-hating family. Historian William Leuchtenburg says that before 1960, &quot;Kennedy showed a conspicuous lack of inclination to identify himself as a New Deal liberal.&quot; He adds, as president, &quot;Kennedy never wholly embraced the Roosevelt tradition and at times he deliberately severed himself from it.&quot; By contrast, young Lyndon Johnson had been an enthusiastic New Dealer and a favorite of Roosevelt. Johnson modelled his presidency on Roosevelt&#x27;s.

During his presidency, and continuing to a lesser extent afterwards, there has been much criticism of Roosevelt, some of it intense. Critics have questioned not only his policies, positions, and the consolidation of power that occurred due to his responses to the Depression and World War II but also his breaking with tradition by running for a third term as president. Long after his death, new lines of attack criticized Roosevelt&#x27;s policies regarding helping the Jews of Europe, incarcerating the Japanese on the West Coast, and opposing anti-lynching legislation.

Roosevelt was criticized by conservatives for his economic policies, especially the shift in tone from individualism to collectivism with the expansion of the welfare state and regulation of the economy. Those criticisms continued decades after his death. One factor in the revisiting of these issues was the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, who opposed the New Deal.

===Memorials===
Roosevelt&#x27;s home in Hyde Park is now a National Historic Site and home to his Presidential library. Washington, D.C., hosts two memorials: the Roosevelt Memorial, located next to the Jefferson Memorial on the Tidal Basin, and a more modest memorial, a block of marble in front of the National Archives building suggested by Roosevelt himself, erected in 1965. Roosevelt&#x27;s leadership in the March of Dimes is one reason he is commemorated on the American dime. Roosevelt has also appeared on several U.S. Postage stamps. On April 29, 1945, seventeen days after Roosevelt&#x27;s death, the carrier USS &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; was launched and served from 1945 to 1977. London&#x27;s Westminster Abbey also has a stone tablet memorial to Roosevelt that was unveiled by Attlee and Churchill in 1948. Welfare Island was renamed after Roosevelt in September 1973.

<text>The Four Freedoms were goals articulated by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt on Monday, January 6, 1941. In an address known as the (technically the 1941 State of the Union address), he proposed four fundamental freedoms that people &quot;everywhere in the world&quot; ought to enjoy:

# Freedom of speech and expression
# Freedom of worship
# Freedom from want
# Freedom from fear

Roosevelt delivered his speech 11 months before the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which caused the United States to declare war on Japan on December 8, 1941. The State of the Union speech before Congress was largely about the national security of the United States and the threat to other democracies from world war. In the speech, he made a break with the long-held tradition of United States non-interventionism. He outlined the U.S. role in helping allies already engaged in warfare, especially Great Britain and China.

In that context, he summarized the values of democracy behind the bipartisan consensus on international involvement that existed at the time. A famous quote from the speech prefaces those values: &quot;As men do not live by bread alone, they do not fight by armaments alone.&quot; In the second half of the speech, he lists the benefits of democracy, which include economic opportunity, employment, social security, and the promise of &quot;adequate health care&quot;. The first two freedoms, of speech and religion, are protected by the First Amendment in the United States Constitution. His inclusion of the latter two freedoms went beyond the traditional Constitutional values protected by the U.S. Bill of Rights. Roosevelt endorsed a broader human right to economic security and anticipated what would become known decades later as the &quot;human security&quot; paradigm in studies of economic development. He also included the &quot;freedom from fear&quot; against international aggression, calling for a &quot;world-wide reduction of armaments.&quot;

==Historical context==
In the 1930s many Americans, arguing that the involvement in World War I had been a mistake, were adamantly against continued intervention in European affairs. With the Neutrality Acts established after 1935, U.S. law banned the sale of armaments to countries that were at war and placed restrictions on travel with belligerent vessels.

When World War II began in September 1939, the neutrality laws were still in effect and ensured that no substantial support could be given to Britain and France. With the revision of the Neutrality Act in 1939, Roosevelt adopted a &quot;methods-short-of-war policy&quot; whereby supplies and armaments could be given to European Allies, provided no declaration of war could be made and no troops committed. By December 1940, Europe was largely at the mercy of Adolf Hitler and Germany&#x27;s Nazi regime. With Germany&#x27;s defeat of France in June 1940, Britain and its overseas Empire stood alone against the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Winston Churchill, as Prime Minister of Britain, called for Roosevelt and the United States to supply them with armaments in order to continue with the war effort.

The 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair had celebrated Four Freedoms – religion, speech, press, and assembly – and commissioned Leo Friedlander to create sculptures representing them. Mayor of New York City Fiorello La Guardia described the resulting statues as the &quot;heart of the fair&quot;. Later Roosevelt would declare his own &quot;Four Essential Freedoms&quot; and call on Walter Russell to create a &quot;Four Freedoms Monument&quot; that was eventually dedicated at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

They also appeared on the reverse of the AM-lira, the Allied Military Currency note issue that was issued in Italy during WWII, by the Americans, that was in effect occupation currency, guaranteed by the American dollar.

==Declarations==
The Four Freedoms Speech was given on January 6, 1941. Roosevelt&#x27;s hope was to provide a rationale for why the United States should abandon the isolationist policies that emerged from World War I. In the address, Roosevelt critiqued Isolationism, saying: &quot;No realistic American can expect from a dictator&#x27;s peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion–or even good business. Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors. &#x27;Those, who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.&#x27;&quot;

The speech coincided with the introduction of the Lend-Lease Act, which promoted Roosevelt&#x27;s plan to become the &quot;arsenal of democracy&quot; and support the Allies (mainly the British) with much-needed supplies. Furthermore, the speech established what would become the ideological basis for America&#x27;s involvement in World War II, all framed in terms of individual rights and liberties that are the hallmark of American politics.

The speech delivered by President Roosevelt incorporated the following text, known as the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot;:

Later in the same speech the president went on to specify six basic goals:
* Equality of opportunity for youth and for others.
* Jobs for those who can work.
* Security for those who need it.
* The ending of special privilege for the few.
* The preservation of civil liberties for all.
* The enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living.

==Justification for war==
The declaration of the Four Freedoms as a justification for war would resonate through the remainder of the war, and for decades longer as a frame of remembrance. The Freedoms became the staple of America&#x27;s war aims and the center of all attempts to rally public support for the war. With the creation of the Office of War Information (1942), as well as the famous paintings by Norman Rockwell, the Freedoms were advertised as values central to American life and examples of American exceptionalism.

==Opposition==

The Four Freedoms Speech was popular, and the goals were influential in postwar politics. However, in 1941 the speech received heavy criticism from anti-war elements. Critics argued that the Four Freedoms were simply a charter for Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, social reforms that had already created sharp divisions within Congress. Conservatives who opposed social programs and increased government intervention argued against Roosevelt&#x27;s attempt to justify and depict the war as necessary for the defense of lofty goals.

While the Freedoms did become a forceful aspect of American thought on the war, they were never the exclusive justification for the war. Polls and surveys conducted by the United States Office of War Information (OWI) revealed that self-defense and vengeance for the attack on Pearl Harbor were still the most prevalent reasons for war.

==United Nations==
The concept of the Four Freedoms became part of the personal mission undertaken by former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt in 1948. She helped inspire the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, General Assembly Resolution 217A. Indeed, these Four Freedoms were explicitly incorporated into the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which reads: &quot;&quot;Whereas&quot; disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy the freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed the highest aspiration of the common people.&quot;

==Disarmament==
FDR called for &quot;a world-wide reduction of armaments&quot; as a goal for &quot;the future days, which we seek to make secure&quot; but one that was &quot;attainable in our own time and generation.&quot; More immediately, though, he called for a massive build-up of U.S. arms production:

==Violation==

In a 1942 radio address, President Roosevelt declared the Four Freedoms embodied &quot;rights of men of every creed and every race, wherever they live.&quot; On February 19, 1942, he authorized Japanese American internment with Executive Order 9066. It allowed local military commanders to designate &quot;military areas&quot; as &quot;exclusion zones&quot;, from which &quot;any or all persons may be excluded&quot;. This power was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were excluded from the entire Pacific coast, including all of California and much of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, except for those in internment camps. By 1946, the United States had incarcerated 120,000 individuals of Japanese descent, of whom about 80,000 had been born in the United States.

==Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park==

The Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park is a park designed by the architect Louis Kahn for the south point of Roosevelt Island. The park celebrates the famous speech, and text from the speech is inscribed on a granite wall in the final design of the park.

==Awards==

The Roosevelt Institute honors outstanding individuals who have demonstrated a lifelong commitment to these ideals. The Four Freedoms Award medals are awarded at ceremonies at Hyde Park, New York and Middelburg, Netherlands during alternate years. The awards were first presented in 1982 on the centenary of President Roosevelt&#x27;s birth as well as the bicentenary of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Netherlands.

<text>First-order logic—also called predicate logic, predicate calculus, quantificational logic—is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects, and allows the use of sentences that contain variables. Rather than propositions such as &quot;all men are mortal&quot;, in first-order logic one can have expressions in the form &quot;for all &quot;x&quot;, if &quot;x&quot; is a man, then &quot;x&quot; is mortal&quot;; where &quot;for all &quot;x&quot;&quot; is a quantifier, &quot;x&quot; is a variable, and &quot;... &quot;is a man&quot;&quot; and &quot;... &quot;is mortal&quot;&quot; are predicates. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations; in this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic.

A theory about a topic, such as set theory, a theory for groups, or a formal theory of arithmetic, is usually a first-order logic together with a specified domain of discourse (over which the quantified variables range), finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many predicates defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold about them. &quot;Theory&quot; is sometimes understood in a more formal sense as just a set of sentences in first-order logic.

The term &quot;first-order&quot; distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic, in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which quantification over predicates, functions, or both, are permitted. In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.

There are many deductive systems for first-order logic which are both sound, i.e. all provable statements are true in all models; and complete, i.e. all statements which are true in all models are provable. Although the logical consequence relation is only semidecidable, much progress has been made in automated theorem proving in first-order logic. First-order logic also satisfies several metalogical theorems that make it amenable to analysis in proof theory, such as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem.

First-order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into axioms, and is studied in the foundations of mathematics. Peano arithmetic and Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory are axiomatizations of number theory and set theory, respectively, into first-order logic. No first-order theory, however, has the strength to uniquely describe a structure with an infinite domain, such as the natural numbers or the real line. Axiom systems that do fully describe these two structures, i.e. categorical axiom systems, can be obtained in stronger logics such as second-order logic.

The foundations of first-order logic were developed independently by Gottlob Frege and Charles Sanders Peirce. For a history of first-order logic and how it came to dominate formal logic, see José Ferreirós (2001).

==Introduction==

While propositional logic deals with simple declarative propositions, first-order logic additionally covers predicates and quantification. A predicate evaluates to true or false for an entity or entities in the domain of discourse.

Consider the two sentences &quot;Socrates is a philosopher&quot; and &quot;Plato is a philosopher&quot;. In propositional logic, these sentences themselves are viewed as the individuals of study, and might be denoted, for example, by variables such as &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;. They are not viewed as an application of a predicate, such as formula_1, to any particular objects in the domain of discourse, instead viewing them as purely an utterance which is either true or false. However, in first-order logic, these two sentences may be framed as statements that a certain individual or non-logical object has a property. In this example, both sentences happen to have the common form formula_2 for some individual formula_3, in the first sentence the value of the variable &quot;x&quot; is &quot;Socrates&quot;, and in the second sentence it is &quot;Plato&quot;. Due to the ability to speak about non-logical individuals along with the original logical connectives, first-order logic includes propositional logic.

The truth of a formula such as &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a philosopher&quot; depends on which object is denoted by &quot;x&quot; and on the interpretation of the predicate &quot;is a philosopher&quot;. Consequently, &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a philosopher&quot; alone does not have a definite truth value of true or false, and is akin to a sentence fragment. Relationships between predicates can be stated using logical connectives. For example, the first-order formula &quot;if &quot;x&quot; is a philosopher, then &quot;x&quot; is a scholar&quot;, is a conditional statement with &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a philosopher&quot; as its hypothesis, and &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a scholar&quot; as its conclusion, which again needs specification of &quot;x&quot; in order to have a definite truth value.

Quantifiers can be applied to variables in a formula. The variable &quot;x&quot; in the previous formula can be universally quantified, for instance, with the first-order sentence &quot;For every &quot;x&quot;, if &quot;x&quot; is a philosopher, then &quot;x&quot; is a scholar&quot;. The universal quantifier &quot;for every&quot; in this sentence expresses the idea that the claim &quot;if &quot;x&quot; is a philosopher, then &quot;x&quot; is a scholar&quot; holds for &quot;all&quot; choices of &quot;x&quot;.

The &quot;negation&quot; of the sentence &quot;For every &quot;x&quot;, if &quot;x&quot; is a philosopher, then &quot;x&quot; is a scholar&quot; is logically equivalent to the sentence &quot;There exists &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; is a philosopher and &quot;x&quot; is not a scholar&quot;. The existential quantifier &quot;there exists&quot; expresses the idea that the claim &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a philosopher and &quot;x&quot; is not a scholar&quot; holds for &quot;some&quot; choice of &quot;x&quot;.

The predicates &quot;is a philosopher&quot; and &quot;is a scholar&quot; each take a single variable. In general, predicates can take several variables. In the first-order sentence &quot;Socrates is the teacher of Plato&quot;, the predicate &quot;is the teacher of&quot; takes two variables.

An interpretation (or model) of a first-order formula specifies what each predicate means, and the entities that can instantiate the variables. These entities form the domain of discourse or universe, which is usually required to be a nonempty set. For example, consider the sentence &quot;There exists &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; is a philosopher.&quot; This sentence is seen as being true in an interpretation such that the domain of discourse consists of all human beings, and that the predicate &quot;is a philosopher&quot; is understood as &quot;was the author of the &quot;Republic&quot;.&quot; It is true, as witnessed by Plato in that text.

There are two key parts of first-order logic. The syntax determines which finite sequences of symbols are well-formed expressions in first-order logic, while the semantics determines the meanings behind these expressions.

==Syntax==

Unlike natural languages, such as English, the language of first-order logic is completely formal, so that it can be mechanically determined whether a given expression is well formed. There are two key types of well-formed expressions: &quot;terms&quot;, which intuitively represent objects, and &quot;formulas&quot;, which intuitively express statements that can be true or false. The terms and formulas of first-order logic are strings of &quot;symbols&quot;, where all the symbols together form the &quot;alphabet&quot; of the language. 

===Alphabet===
As with all formal languages, the nature of the symbols themselves is outside the scope of formal logic; they are often regarded simply as letters and punctuation symbols.

It is common to divide the symbols of the alphabet into &quot;logical symbols&quot;, which always have the same meaning, and &quot;non-logical symbols&quot;, whose meaning varies by interpretation. For example, the logical symbol formula_4 always represents &quot;and&quot;; it is never interpreted as &quot;or&quot;, which is represented by the logical symbol formula_5. However, a non-logical predicate symbol such as Phil(&quot;x&quot;) could be interpreted to mean &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a philosopher&quot;, &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a man named Philip&quot;, or any other unary predicate depending on the interpretation at hand.

====Logical symbols====
Logical symbols are a set of characters that vary by author, but usually include the following:
* Quantifier symbols: for universal quantification, and for existential quantification
* Logical connectives: for conjunction, for disjunction, for implication, for biconditional, for negation. Some authors use C&quot;pq&quot; instead of and E&quot;pq&quot; instead of , especially in contexts where → is used for other purposes. Moreover, the horseshoe may replace ; the triple-bar may replace ; a tilde (), N&quot;p&quot;, or F&quot;p&quot; may replace ; a double bar formula_6, formula_7, or A&quot;pq&quot; may replace ; and an ampersand , K&quot;pq&quot;, or the middle dot may replace , especially if these symbols are not available for technical reasons. (The aforementioned symbols C&quot;pq&quot;, E&quot;pq&quot;, N&quot;p&quot;, A&quot;pq&quot;, and K&quot;pq&quot; are used in Polish notation.)
* Parentheses, brackets, and other punctuation symbols. The choice of such symbols varies depending on context.
* An infinite set of &quot;variables&quot;, often denoted by lowercase letters at the end of the alphabet &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, ... . Subscripts are often used to distinguish variables: 
* An &quot;equality symbol&quot; (sometimes, &quot;identity symbol&quot;) (see below).

Not all of these symbols are required in first-order logic. Either one of the quantifiers along with negation, conjunction (or disjunction), variables, brackets, and equality suffices.

Other logical symbols include the following:
* Truth constants: T, V, or for &quot;true&quot; and F, O, or for &quot;false&quot; (V and O are from Polish notation). Without any such logical operators of valence 0, these two constants can only be expressed using quantifiers.
* Additional logical connectives such as the Sheffer stroke, D&quot;pq&quot; (NAND), and exclusive or, J&quot;pq&quot;.

====Non-logical symbols====
Non-logical symbols represent predicates (relations), functions and constants. It used to be standard practice to use a fixed, infinite set of non-logical symbols for all purposes:

* For every integer &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0, there is a collection of &quot;n&quot;-&quot;ary&quot;, or &quot;n&quot;-&quot;place&quot;, &quot;predicate symbols&quot;. Because they represent relations between &quot;n&quot; elements, they are also called &quot;relation symbols&quot;. For each arity &quot;n&quot;, there is an infinite supply of them:
*:&quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;0, &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;1, &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;2, &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;3, ...
* For every integer &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0, there are infinitely many &quot;n&quot;-ary &quot;function symbols&quot;:
*:&quot;f n&quot;0, &quot;f n&quot;1, &quot;f n&quot;2, &quot;f n&quot;3, ...

When the arity of a predicate symbol or function symbol is clear from context, the superscript &quot;n&quot; is often omitted.

In this traditional approach, there is only one language of first-order logic. This approach is still common, especially in philosophically oriented books.

A more recent practice is to use different non-logical symbols according to the application one has in mind. Therefore, it has become necessary to name the set of all non-logical symbols used in a particular application. This choice is made via a &quot;signature&quot;.

Typical signatures in mathematics are {1, ×} or just {×} for groups, or {0, 1, +, ×, &lt;} for ordered fields. There are no restrictions on the number of non-logical symbols. The signature can be empty, finite, or infinite, even uncountable. Uncountable signatures occur for example in modern proofs of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem.

Though signatures might in some cases imply how non-logical symbols are to be interpreted, interpretation of the non-logical symbols in the signature is separate (and not necessarily fixed). Signatures concern syntax rather than semantics.

In this approach, every non-logical symbol is of one of the following types:

* A &quot;predicate symbol&quot; (or &quot;relation symbol&quot;) with some &quot;valence&quot; (or &quot;arity&quot;, number of arguments) greater than or equal to 0. These are often denoted by uppercase letters such as &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;R&quot;. Examples:
** In &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;P&quot; is a predicate symbol of valence 1. One possible interpretation is &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a man&quot;.
** In &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;), &quot;Q&quot; is a predicate symbol of valence 2. Possible interpretations include &quot;&quot;x&quot; is greater than &quot;y&quot; and &quot;x&quot; is the father of &quot;y&quot;&quot;.
** Relations of valence 0 can be identified with propositional variables, which can stand for any statement. One possible interpretation of &quot;R&quot; is &quot;Socrates is a man&quot;.
* A &quot;function symbol&quot;, with some valence greater than or equal to 0. These are often denoted by lowercase roman letters such as &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot;. Examples:
** &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) may be interpreted as &quot;the father of &quot;x&quot;&quot;. In arithmetic, it may stand for &quot;-x&quot;. In set theory, it may stand for &quot;the power set of x&quot;.
** In arithmetic, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) may stand for &quot;&quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot;&quot;. In set theory, it may stand for &quot;the union of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;&quot;.
** Function symbols of valence 0 are called &quot;constant symbols&quot;, and are often denoted by lowercase letters at the beginning of the alphabet such as &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;. The symbol &quot;a&quot; may stand for Socrates. In arithmetic, it may stand for 0. In set theory, it may stand for the empty set.

The traditional approach can be recovered in the modern approach, by simply specifying the &quot;custom&quot; signature to consist of the traditional sequences of non-logical symbols.

===Formation rules===

The formation rules define the terms and formulas of first-order logic. When terms and formulas are represented as strings of symbols, these rules can be used to write a formal grammar for terms and formulas. These rules are generally context-free (each production has a single symbol on the left side), except that the set of symbols may be allowed to be infinite and there may be many start symbols, for example the variables in the case of terms.

====Terms====
The set of &quot;terms&quot; is inductively defined by the following rules:
# &quot;Variables&quot;. Any variable symbol is a term.
# &quot;Functions&quot;. If &quot;f&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-ary function symbol, and &quot;t&quot;1, ..., &quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot; are terms, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;1...,&quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is a term. In particular, symbols denoting individual constants are nullary function symbols, and thus are terms.
Only expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1 and 2 are terms. For example, no expression involving a predicate symbol is a term.

====Formulas====
The set of &quot;formulas&quot; (also called &quot;well-formed formulas&quot; or &quot;WFFs&quot;) is inductively defined by the following rules:
# &quot;Predicate symbols&quot;. If &quot;P&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-ary predicate symbol and &quot;t&quot;1, ..., &quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot; are terms then &quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;1...,&quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is a formula.
# &quot;Equality&quot;. If the equality symbol is considered part of logic, and &quot;t&quot;1 and &quot;t&quot;2 are terms, then &quot;t&quot;1 = &quot;t&quot;2 is a formula.
# &quot;Negation&quot;. If formula_8 is a formula, then formula_9 is a formula.
# &quot;Binary connectives&quot;. If and are formulas, then (formula_10) is a formula. Similar rules apply to other binary logical connectives.
# &quot;Quantifiers&quot;. If formula_8 is a formula and &quot;x&quot; is a variable, then formula_12 (for all x, formula_8 holds) and formula_14 (there exists x such that formula_8) are formulas.
Only expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1–5 are formulas. The formulas obtained from the first two rules are said to be &quot;atomic formulas&quot;.

For example:
:formula_16
is a formula, if &quot;f&quot; is a unary function symbol, &quot;P&quot; a unary predicate symbol, and Q a ternary predicate symbol. However, formula_17 is not a formula, although it is a string of symbols from the alphabet.

The role of the parentheses in the definition is to ensure that any formula can only be obtained in one way—by following the inductive definition (i.e., there is a unique parse tree for each formula). This property is known as &quot;unique readability&quot; of formulas. There are many conventions for where parentheses are used in formulas. For example, some authors use colons or full stops instead of parentheses, or change the places in which parentheses are inserted. Each author&#x27;s particular definition must be accompanied by a proof of unique readability.

====Notational conventions====
For convenience, conventions have been developed about the precedence of the logical operators, to avoid the need to write parentheses in some cases. These rules are similar to the order of operations in arithmetic. A common convention is:
* formula_18 is evaluated first
* formula_4 and formula_5 are evaluated next
* Quantifiers are evaluated next
* formula_21 is evaluated last.
Moreover, extra punctuation not required by the definition may be inserted—to make formulas easier to read. Thus the formula:
:formula_22
might be written as:
:formula_23

In some fields, it is common to use infix notation for binary relations and functions, instead of the prefix notation defined above. For example, in arithmetic, one typically writes &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot; instead of &quot;=(+(2,2),4)&quot;. It is common to regard formulas in infix notation as abbreviations for the corresponding formulas in prefix notation, cf. also term structure vs. representation.

The definitions above use infix notation for binary connectives such as formula_21. A less common convention is Polish notation, in which one writes formula_25, formula_26 and so on in front of their arguments rather than between them. This convention is advantageous in that it allows all punctuation symbols to be discarded. As such, Polish notation is compact and elegant, but rarely used in practice because it is hard for humans to read. In Polish notation, the formula:
:formula_16
becomes 

===Free and bound variables===
In a formula, a variable may occur &quot;free&quot; or &quot;bound&quot; (or both). One formalization of this notion is due to Quine, first the concept of a variable occurrence is defined, then whether a variable occurrence is free or bound, then whether a variable symbol overall is free or bound. In order to distinguish different occurrences of the identical symbol &quot;x&quot;, each occurrence of a variable symbol &quot;x&quot; in a formula φ is identified with the initial substring of φ up to the point at which said instance of the symbol &quot;x&quot; appears.p.297 Then, an occurrence of &quot;x&quot; is said to be bound if that occurrence of &quot;x&quot; lies within the scope of at least one of either formula_28 or formula_29. Finally, &quot;x&quot; is bound in φ if all occurrences of &quot;x&quot; in φ are bound.pp.142--143

Intuitively, a variable symbol is free in a formula if at no point is it quantified:pp.142--143 in , the sole occurrence of variable &quot;x&quot; is free while that of &quot;y&quot; is bound. The free and bound variable occurrences in a formula are defined inductively as follows.
; Atomic formulas : If &quot;φ&quot; is an atomic formula, then &quot;x&quot; occurs free in &quot;φ&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; occurs in &quot;φ&quot;. Moreover, there are no bound variables in any atomic formula.
; Negation : &quot;x&quot; occurs free in ¬&quot;φ&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; occurs free in &quot;φ&quot;. &quot;x&quot; occurs bound in ¬&quot;φ&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; occurs bound in &quot;φ&quot;
; Binary connectives : &quot;x&quot; occurs free in (&quot;φ&quot; → &quot;ψ&quot;) if and only if &quot;x&quot; occurs free in either &quot;φ&quot; or &quot;ψ&quot;. &quot;x&quot; occurs bound in (&quot;φ&quot; → &quot;ψ&quot;) if and only if &quot;x&quot; occurs bound in either &quot;φ&quot; or &quot;ψ&quot;. The same rule applies to any other binary connective in place of →.
; Quantifiers : &quot;x&quot; occurs free in , if and only if x occurs free in &quot;φ&quot; and &quot;x&quot; is a different symbol from &quot;y&quot;. Also, &quot;x&quot; occurs bound in , if and only if &quot;x&quot; is &quot;y&quot; or &quot;x&quot; occurs bound in &quot;φ&quot;. The same rule holds with in place of .

For example, in , &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; occur only bound, &quot;z&quot; occurs only free, and &quot;w&quot; is neither because it does not occur in the formula.

Free and bound variables of a formula need not be disjoint sets: in the formula , the first occurrence of &quot;x&quot;, as argument of &quot;P&quot;, is free while the second one, as argument of &quot;Q&quot;, is bound.

A formula in first-order logic with no free variable occurrences is called a &quot;first-order sentence&quot;. These are the formulas that will have well-defined truth values under an interpretation. For example, whether a formula such as Phil(&quot;x&quot;) is true must depend on what &quot;x&quot; represents. But the sentence will be either true or false in a given interpretation.

===Example: ordered abelian groups===
In mathematics, the language of ordered abelian groups has one constant symbol 0, one unary function symbol −, one binary function symbol +, and one binary relation symbol ≤. Then:
*The expressions +(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) and +(&quot;x&quot;, +(&quot;y&quot;, −(&quot;z&quot;))) are &quot;terms&quot;. These are usually written as &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; and &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; − &quot;z&quot;.
*The expressions +(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 0 and ≤(+(&quot;x&quot;, +(&quot;y&quot;, −(&quot;z&quot;))), +(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)) are &quot;atomic formulas&quot;. These are usually written as &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; = 0 and &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; − &quot;z&quot;  ≤  &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;.
*The expression formula_30 is a &quot;formula&quot;, which is usually written as formula_31 This formula has one free variable, &quot;z&quot;.

The axioms for ordered abelian groups can be expressed as a set of sentences in the language. For example, the axiom stating that the group is commutative is usually written formula_32

==Semantics==
An interpretation of a first-order language assigns a denotation to each non-logical symbol (predicate symbol, function symbol, or constant symbol) in that language. It also determines a domain of discourse that specifies the range of the quantifiers. The result is that each term is assigned an object that it represents, each predicate is assigned a property of objects, and each sentence is assigned a truth value. In this way, an interpretation provides semantic meaning to the terms, predicates, and formulas of the language. The study of the interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics. What follows is a description of the standard or Tarskian semantics for first-order logic. (It is also possible to define game semantics for first-order logic, but aside from requiring the axiom of choice, game semantics agree with Tarskian semantics for first-order logic, so game semantics will not be elaborated herein.)

===First-order structures===
The most common way of specifying an interpretation (especially in mathematics) is to specify a &quot;structure&quot; (also called a &quot;model&quot;; see below). The structure consists of a domain of discourse &quot;D&quot; and an interpretation function mapping non-logical symbols to predicates, functions, and constants.

The domain of discourse &quot;D&quot; is a nonempty set of &quot;objects&quot; of some kind. Intuitively, given an interpretation, a first-order formula becomes a statement about these objects; for example, formula_33 states the existence of some object in &quot;D&quot; for which the predicate &quot;P&quot; is true (or, more precisely, for which the predicate assigned to the predicate symbol &quot;P&quot; by the interpretation is true). For example, one can take &quot;D&quot; to be the set of integers.

Non-logical symbols are interpreted as follows:

* The interpretation of an &quot;n&quot;-ary function symbol is a function from &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; to &quot;D&quot;. For example, if the domain of discourse is the set of integers, a function symbol &quot;f&quot; of arity 2 can be interpreted as the function that gives the sum of its arguments. In other words, the symbol &quot;f&quot; is associated with the function which, in this interpretation, is addition.

* The interpretation of a constant symbol (a function symbol of arity 0) is a function from &quot;D&quot;0 (a set whose only member is the empty tuple) to &quot;D&quot;, which can be simply identified with an object in &quot;D&quot;. For example, an interpretation may assign the value formula_34 to the constant symbol formula_35.

* The interpretation of an &quot;n&quot;-ary predicate symbol is a set of &quot;n&quot;-tuples of elements of &quot;D&quot;, giving the arguments for which the predicate is true. For example, an interpretation formula_36 of a binary predicate symbol &quot;P&quot; may be the set of pairs of integers such that the first one is less than the second. According to this interpretation, the predicate &quot;P&quot; would be true if its first argument is less than its second argument. Equivalently, predicate symbols may be assigned Boolean-valued functions from &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; to formula_37.

===Evaluation of truth values===
A formula evaluates to true or false given an interpretation and a variable assignment μ that associates an element of the domain of discourse with each variable. The reason that a variable assignment is required is to give meanings to formulas with free variables, such as formula_38. The truth value of this formula changes depending on the values that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; denote.

First, the variable assignment μ can be extended to all terms of the language, with the result that each term maps to a single element of the domain of discourse. The following rules are used to make this assignment:
* &quot;Variables&quot;. Each variable &quot;x&quot; evaluates to &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)
* &quot;Functions&quot;. Given terms formula_39 that have been evaluated to elements formula_40 of the domain of discourse, and a &quot;n&quot;-ary function symbol &quot;f&quot;, the term formula_41 evaluates to formula_42.

Next, each formula is assigned a truth value. The inductive definition used to make this assignment is called the T-schema.
* &quot;Atomic formulas (1)&quot;. A formula formula_43 is associated the value true or false depending on whether formula_44, where formula_45 are the evaluation of the terms formula_46 and formula_36 is the interpretation of formula_48, which by assumption is a subset of formula_49.
* &quot;Atomic formulas (2)&quot;. A formula formula_50 is assigned true if formula_51 and formula_52 evaluate to the same object of the domain of discourse (see the section on equality below).
* &quot;Logical connectives&quot;. A formula in the form formula_53, formula_54, etc. is evaluated according to the truth table for the connective in question, as in propositional logic.
* &quot;Existential quantifiers&quot;. A formula formula_55 is true according to &quot;M&quot; and formula_56 if there exists an evaluation formula_57 of the variables that differs from formula_56 at most regarding the evaluation of &quot;x&quot; and such that φ is true according to the interpretation &quot;M&quot; and the variable assignment formula_57. This formal definition captures the idea that formula_55 is true if and only if there is a way to choose a value for &quot;x&quot; such that φ(&quot;x&quot;) is satisfied.
* &quot;Universal quantifiers&quot;. A formula formula_61 is true according to &quot;M&quot; and formula_56 if φ(&quot;x&quot;) is true for every pair composed by the interpretation &quot;M&quot; and some variable assignment formula_57 that differs from formula_56 at most on the value of &quot;x&quot;. This captures the idea that formula_61 is true if every possible choice of a value for &quot;x&quot; causes φ(&quot;x&quot;) to be true.

If a formula does not contain free variables, and so is a sentence, then the initial variable assignment does not affect its truth value. In other words, a sentence is true according to &quot;M&quot; and formula_56 if and only if it is true according to &quot;M&quot; and every other variable assignment formula_57.

There is a second common approach to defining truth values that does not rely on variable assignment functions. Instead, given an interpretation &quot;M&quot;, one first adds to the signature a collection of constant symbols, one for each element of the domain of discourse in &quot;M&quot;; say that for each &quot;d&quot; in the domain the constant symbol &quot;c&quot;&quot;d&quot; is fixed. The interpretation is extended so that each new constant symbol is assigned to its corresponding element of the domain. One now defines truth for quantified formulas syntactically, as follows:
* &quot;Existential quantifiers (alternate)&quot;. A formula formula_55 is true according to &quot;M&quot; if there is some &quot;d&quot; in the domain of discourse such that formula_69 holds. Here formula_69 is the result of substituting &quot;c&quot;&quot;d&quot; for every free occurrence of &quot;x&quot; in φ.
* &quot;Universal quantifiers (alternate)&quot;. A formula formula_61 is true according to &quot;M&quot; if, for every &quot;d&quot; in the domain of discourse, formula_69 is true according to &quot;M&quot;.
This alternate approach gives exactly the same truth values to all sentences as the approach via variable assignments.

===Validity, satisfiability, and logical consequence===

If a sentence φ evaluates to &quot;true&quot; under a given interpretation &quot;M&quot;, one says that &quot;M&quot; &quot;satisfies&quot; φ; this is denoted formula_73. A sentence is &quot;satisfiable&quot; if there is some interpretation under which it is true. This is a bit different from the symbol formula_74 from model theory, where formula_75 denotes satisfiability in a model, i.e. &quot;there is a suitable assignment of values in formula_76&#x27;s domain to variable symbols of formula_77&quot;.

Satisfiability of formulas with free variables is more complicated, because an interpretation on its own does not determine the truth value of such a formula. The most common convention is that a formula φ with free variables formula_78, ..., formula_79 is said to be satisfied by an interpretation if the formula φ remains true regardless which individuals from the domain of discourse are assigned to its free variables formula_78, ..., formula_79. This has the same effect as saying that a formula φ is satisfied if and only if its universal closure formula_82 is satisfied.

A formula is &quot;logically valid&quot; (or simply &quot;valid&quot;) if it is true in every interpretation. These formulas play a role similar to tautologies in propositional logic.

A formula φ is a &quot;logical consequence&quot; of a formula ψ if every interpretation that makes ψ true also makes φ true. In this case one says that φ is logically implied by ψ.

===Algebraizations===
An alternate approach to the semantics of first-order logic proceeds via abstract algebra. This approach generalizes the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebras of propositional logic. There are three ways of eliminating quantified variables from first-order logic that do not involve replacing quantifiers with other variable binding term operators:
*Cylindric algebra, by Alfred Tarski and colleagues;
*Polyadic algebra, by Paul Halmos;
*Predicate functor logic, mainly due to Willard Quine.
These algebras are all lattices that properly extend the two-element Boolean algebra.

Tarski and Givant (1987) showed that the fragment of first-order logic that has no atomic sentence lying in the scope of more than three quantifiers has the same expressive power as relation algebra. This fragment is of great interest because it suffices for Peano arithmetic and most axiomatic set theory, including the canonical Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). They also prove that first-order logic with a primitive ordered pair is equivalent to a relation algebra with two ordered pair projection functions.

===First-order theories, models, and elementary classes===
A &quot;first-order theory&quot; of a particular signature is a set of axioms, which are sentences consisting of symbols from that signature. The set of axioms is often finite or recursively enumerable, in which case the theory is called &quot;effective&quot;. Some authors require theories to also include all logical consequences of the axioms. The axioms are considered to hold within the theory and from them other sentences that hold within the theory can be derived.

A first-order structure that satisfies all sentences in a given theory is said to be a &quot;model&quot; of the theory. An &quot;elementary class&quot; is the set of all structures satisfying a particular theory. These classes are a main subject of study in model theory.

Many theories have an &quot;intended interpretation&quot;, a certain model that is kept in mind when studying the theory. For example, the intended interpretation of Peano arithmetic consists of the usual natural numbers with their usual operations. However, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that most first-order theories will also have other, nonstandard models.

A theory is &quot;consistent&quot; if it is not possible to prove a contradiction from the axioms of the theory. A theory is &quot;complete&quot; if, for every formula in its signature, either that formula or its negation is a logical consequence of the axioms of the theory. Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem shows that effective first-order theories that include a sufficient portion of the theory of the natural numbers can never be both consistent and complete.

===Empty domains===

The definition above requires that the domain of discourse of any interpretation must be nonempty. There are settings, such as inclusive logic, where empty domains are permitted. Moreover, if a class of algebraic structures includes an empty structure (for example, there is an empty poset), that class can only be an elementary class in first-order logic if empty domains are permitted or the empty structure is removed from the class.

There are several difficulties with empty domains, however:
* Many common rules of inference are valid only when the domain of discourse is required to be nonempty. One example is the rule stating that formula_83 implies formula_84 when &quot;x&quot; is not a free variable in formula_8. This rule, which is used to put formulas into prenex normal form, is sound in nonempty domains, but unsound if the empty domain is permitted.
* The definition of truth in an interpretation that uses a variable assignment function cannot work with empty domains, because there are no variable assignment functions whose range is empty. (Similarly, one cannot assign interpretations to constant symbols.) This truth definition requires that one must select a variable assignment function (μ above) before truth values for even atomic formulas can be defined. Then the truth value of a sentence is defined to be its truth value under any variable assignment, and it is proved that this truth value does not depend on which assignment is chosen. This technique does not work if there are no assignment functions at all; it must be changed to accommodate empty domains.
Thus, when the empty domain is permitted, it must often be treated as a special case. Most authors, however, simply exclude the empty domain by definition.

==Deductive systems==
A &quot;deductive system&quot; is used to demonstrate, on a purely syntactic basis, that one formula is a logical consequence of another formula. There are many such systems for first-order logic, including Hilbert-style deductive systems, natural deduction, the sequent calculus, the tableaux method, and resolution. These share the common property that a deduction is a finite syntactic object; the format of this object, and the way it is constructed, vary widely. These finite deductions themselves are often called &quot;derivations&quot; in proof theory. They are also often called &quot;proofs&quot; but are completely formalized unlike natural-language mathematical proofs.

A deductive system is &quot;sound&quot; if any formula that can be derived in the system is logically valid. Conversely, a deductive system is &quot;complete&quot; if every logically valid formula is derivable. All of the systems discussed in this article are both sound and complete. They also share the property that it is possible to effectively verify that a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction; such deduction systems are called &quot;effective&quot;.

A key property of deductive systems is that they are purely syntactic, so that derivations can be verified without considering any interpretation. Thus, a sound argument is correct in every possible interpretation of the language, regardless of whether that interpretation is about mathematics, economics, or some other area.

In general, logical consequence in first-order logic is only semidecidable: if a sentence A logically implies a sentence B then this can be discovered (for example, by searching for a proof until one is found, using some effective, sound, complete proof system). However, if A does not logically imply B, this does not mean that A logically implies the negation of B. There is no effective procedure that, given formulas A and B, always correctly decides whether A logically implies B.

===Rules of inference===

A &quot;rule of inference&quot; states that, given a particular formula (or set of formulas) with a certain property as a hypothesis, another specific formula (or set of formulas) can be derived as a conclusion. The rule is sound (or truth-preserving) if it preserves validity in the sense that whenever any interpretation satisfies the hypothesis, that interpretation also satisfies the conclusion.

For example, one common rule of inference is the &quot;rule of substitution&quot;. If &quot;t&quot; is a term and φ is a formula possibly containing the variable &quot;x&quot;, then φ[&quot;t&quot;/&quot;x&quot;] is the result of replacing all free instances of &quot;x&quot; by &quot;t&quot; in φ. The substitution rule states that for any φ and any term &quot;t&quot;, one can conclude φ[&quot;t&quot;/&quot;x&quot;] from φ provided that no free variable of &quot;t&quot; becomes bound during the substitution process. (If some free variable of &quot;t&quot; becomes bound, then to substitute &quot;t&quot; for &quot;x&quot; it is first necessary to change the bound variables of φ to differ from the free variables of &quot;t&quot;.)

To see why the restriction on bound variables is necessary, consider the logically valid formula φ given by formula_86, in the signature of (0,1,+,×,=) of arithmetic. If &quot;t&quot; is the term &quot;x + 1&quot;, the formula φ[&quot;t&quot;/&quot;y&quot;] is formula_87, which will be false in many interpretations. The problem is that the free variable &quot;x&quot; of &quot;t&quot; became bound during the substitution. The intended replacement can be obtained by renaming the bound variable &quot;x&quot; of φ to something else, say &quot;z&quot;, so that the formula after substitution is formula_88, which is again logically valid.

The substitution rule demonstrates several common aspects of rules of inference. It is entirely syntactical; one can tell whether it was correctly applied without appeal to any interpretation. It has (syntactically defined) limitations on when it can be applied, which must be respected to preserve the correctness of derivations. Moreover, as is often the case, these limitations are necessary because of interactions between free and bound variables that occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule.

===Hilbert-style systems and natural deduction===
A deduction in a Hilbert-style deductive system is a list of formulas, each of which is a &quot;logical axiom&quot;, a hypothesis that has been assumed for the derivation at hand or follows from previous formulas via a rule of inference. The logical axioms consist of several axiom schemas of logically valid formulas; these encompass a significant amount of propositional logic. The rules of inference enable the manipulation of quantifiers. Typical Hilbert-style systems have a small number of rules of inference, along with several infinite schemas of logical axioms. It is common to have only modus ponens and universal generalization as rules of inference.

Natural deduction systems resemble Hilbert-style systems in that a deduction is a finite list of formulas. However, natural deduction systems have no logical axioms; they compensate by adding additional rules of inference that can be used to manipulate the logical connectives in formulas in the proof.

===Sequent calculus===
The sequent calculus was developed to study the properties of natural deduction systems. Instead of working with one formula at a time, it uses &quot;sequents&quot;, which are expressions of the form:
:formula_89
where A1, ..., A&quot;n&quot;, B1, ..., B&quot;k&quot; are formulas and the turnstile symbol formula_90 is used as punctuation to separate the two halves. Intuitively, a sequent expresses the idea that formula_91 implies formula_92.

===Tableaux method===


Unlike the methods just described the derivations in the tableaux method are not lists of formulas. Instead, a derivation is a tree of formulas. To show that a formula A is provable, the tableaux method attempts to demonstrate that the negation of A is unsatisfiable. The tree of the derivation has formula_93 at its root; the tree branches in a way that reflects the structure of the formula. For example, to show that formula_94 is unsatisfiable requires showing that C and D are each unsatisfiable; this corresponds to a branching point in the tree with parent formula_94 and children C and D.

===Resolution===

The resolution rule is a single rule of inference that, together with unification, is sound and complete for first-order logic. As with the tableaux method, a formula is proved by showing that the negation of the formula is unsatisfiable. Resolution is commonly used in automated theorem proving.

The resolution method works only with formulas that are disjunctions of atomic formulas; arbitrary formulas must first be converted to this form through Skolemization. The resolution rule states that from the hypotheses formula_96 and formula_97, the conclusion formula_98 can be obtained.

===Provable identities===
Many identities can be proved, which establish equivalences between particular formulas. These identities allow for rearranging formulas by moving quantifiers across other connectives and are useful for putting formulas in prenex normal form. Some provable identities include:
:formula_99
:formula_100
:formula_101
:formula_102
:formula_103
:formula_104
:formula_105 (where formula_3 must not occur free in formula_48)
:formula_108 (where formula_3 must not occur free in formula_48)

==Equality and its axioms==

There are several different conventions for using equality (or identity) in first-order logic. The most common convention, known as first-order logic with equality, includes the equality symbol as a primitive logical symbol which is always interpreted as the real equality relation between members of the domain of discourse, such that the &quot;two&quot; given members are the same member. This approach also adds certain axioms about equality to the deductive system employed. These equality axioms are:
* &quot;Reflexivity&quot;. For each variable &quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;.
* &quot;Substitution for functions&quot;. For all variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, and any function symbol &quot;f&quot;,
*:&quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; → &quot;f&quot;(..., &quot;x&quot;, ...) = &quot;f&quot;(..., &quot;y&quot;, ...).
* &quot;Substitution for formulas&quot;. For any variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; and any formula φ(&quot;z&quot;) with a free variable z, then:
*:&quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; → (φ(x) → φ(y)).

These are axiom schemas, each of which specifies an infinite set of axioms. The third schema is known as &quot;Leibniz&#x27;s law&quot;, &quot;the principle of substitutivity&quot;, &quot;the indiscernibility of identicals&quot;, or &quot;the replacement property&quot;. The second schema, involving the function symbol &quot;f&quot;, is (equivalent to) a special case of the third schema, using the formula: 
:φ(z): &quot;f&quot;(..., &quot;x&quot;, ...) = &quot;f&quot;(..., &quot;z&quot;, ...)
Then
:&quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; → (&quot;f&quot;(..., &quot;x&quot;, ...) = &quot;f&quot;(..., &quot;x&quot;, ...) → &quot;f&quot;(..., &quot;x&quot;, ...) = &quot;f&quot;(..., &quot;y&quot;, ...)).

Since &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; is given, and &quot;f&quot;(..., &quot;x&quot;, ...) = &quot;f&quot;(..., &quot;x&quot;, ...) true by reflexivity, we have &quot;f&quot;(..., &quot;x&quot;, ...) = &quot;f&quot;(..., &quot;y&quot;, ...)

Many other properties of equality are consequences of the axioms above, for example:
* &quot;Symmetry&quot;. If &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; then &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;.
* &quot;Transitivity&quot;. If &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; = &quot;z&quot; then &quot;x&quot; = &quot;z&quot;.

===First-order logic without equality===
An alternate approach considers the equality relation to be a non-logical symbol. This convention is known as &quot;first-order logic without equality&quot;. If an equality relation is included in the signature, the axioms of equality must now be added to the theories under consideration, if desired, instead of being considered rules of logic. The main difference between this method and first-order logic with equality is that an interpretation may now interpret two distinct individuals as &quot;equal&quot; (although, by Leibniz&#x27;s law, these will satisfy exactly the same formulas under any interpretation). That is, the equality relation may now be interpreted by an arbitrary equivalence relation on the domain of discourse that is congruent with respect to the functions and relations of the interpretation.

When this second convention is followed, the term &quot;normal model&quot; is used to refer to an interpretation where no distinct individuals &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; satisfy &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;. In first-order logic with equality, only normal models are considered, and so there is no term for a model other than a normal model. When first-order logic without equality is studied, it is necessary to amend the statements of results such as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem so that only normal models are considered.

First-order logic without equality is often employed in the context of second-order arithmetic and other higher-order theories of arithmetic, where the equality relation between sets of natural numbers is usually omitted.

===Defining equality within a theory===
If a theory has a binary formula &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) which satisfies reflexivity and Leibniz&#x27;s law, the theory is said to have equality, or to be a theory with equality. The theory may not have all instances of the above schemas as axioms, but rather as derivable theorems. For example, in theories with no function symbols and a finite number of relations, it is possible to define equality in terms of the relations, by defining the two terms &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; to be equal if any relation is unchanged by changing &quot;s&quot; to &quot;t&quot; in any argument.

Some theories allow other &quot;ad hoc&quot; definitions of equality:
* In the theory of partial orders with one relation symbol ≤, one could define &quot;s&quot; = &quot;t&quot; to be an abbreviation for &quot;s&quot; ≤ &quot;t&quot; &quot;t&quot; ≤ &quot;s&quot;.
* In set theory with one relation ∈, one may define &quot;s&quot; = &quot;t&quot; to be an abbreviation for . This definition of equality then automatically satisfies the axioms for equality. In this case, one should replace the usual axiom of extensionality, which can be stated as formula_111, with an alternative formulation formula_112, which says that if sets &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; have the same elements, then they also belong to the same sets.

==Metalogical properties==
One motivation for the use of first-order logic, rather than higher-order logic, is that first-order logic has many metalogical properties that stronger logics do not have. These results concern general properties of first-order logic itself, rather than properties of individual theories. They provide fundamental tools for the construction of models of first-order theories.

===Completeness and undecidability===
Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem, proved by Kurt Gödel in 1929, establishes that there are sound, complete, effective deductive systems for first-order logic, and thus the first-order logical consequence relation is captured by finite provability. Naively, the statement that a formula φ logically implies a formula ψ depends on every model of φ; these models will in general be of arbitrarily large cardinality, and so logical consequence cannot be effectively verified by checking every model. However, it is possible to enumerate all finite derivations and search for a derivation of ψ from φ. If ψ is logically implied by φ, such a derivation will eventually be found. Thus first-order logical consequence is semidecidable: it is possible to make an effective enumeration of all pairs of sentences (φ,ψ) such that ψ is a logical consequence of φ.

Unlike propositional logic, first-order logic is undecidable (although semidecidable), provided that the language has at least one predicate of arity at least 2 (other than equality). This means that there is no decision procedure that determines whether arbitrary formulas are logically valid. This result was established independently by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing in 1936 and 1937, respectively, giving a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem posed by David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann in 1928. Their proofs demonstrate a connection between the unsolvability of the decision problem for first-order logic and the unsolvability of the halting problem.

There are systems weaker than full first-order logic for which the logical consequence relation is decidable. These include propositional logic and monadic predicate logic, which is first-order logic restricted to unary predicate symbols and no function symbols. Other logics with no function symbols which are decidable are the guarded fragment of first-order logic, as well as two-variable logic. The Bernays–Schönfinkel class of first-order formulas is also decidable. Decidable subsets of first-order logic are also studied in the framework of description logics.

===The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem===
The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that if a first-order theory of cardinality λ has an infinite model, then it has models of every infinite cardinality greater than or equal to λ. One of the earliest results in model theory, it implies that it is not possible to characterize countability or uncountability in a first-order language with a countable signature. That is, there is no first-order formula φ(&quot;x&quot;) such that an arbitrary structure M satisfies φ if and only if the domain of discourse of M is countable (or, in the second case, uncountable).

The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that infinite structures cannot be categorically axiomatized in first-order logic. For example, there is no first-order theory whose only model is the real line: any first-order theory with an infinite model also has a model of cardinality larger than the continuum. Since the real line is infinite, any theory satisfied by the real line is also satisfied by some nonstandard models. When the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is applied to first-order set theories, the nonintuitive consequences are known as Skolem&#x27;s paradox.

===The compactness theorem===
The compactness theorem states that a set of first-order sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model. This implies that if a formula is a logical consequence of an infinite set of first-order axioms, then it is a logical consequence of some finite number of those axioms. This theorem was proved first by Kurt Gödel as a consequence of the completeness theorem, but many additional proofs have been obtained over time. It is a central tool in model theory, providing a fundamental method for constructing models.

The compactness theorem has a limiting effect on which collections of first-order structures are elementary classes. For example, the compactness theorem implies that any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models has an infinite model. Thus, the class of all finite graphs is not an elementary class (the same holds for many other algebraic structures).

There are also more subtle limitations of first-order logic that are implied by the compactness theorem. For example, in computer science, many situations can be modeled as a directed graph of states (nodes) and connections (directed edges). Validating such a system may require showing that no &quot;bad&quot; state can be reached from any &quot;good&quot; state. Thus, one seeks to determine if the good and bad states are in different connected components of the graph. However, the compactness theorem can be used to show that connected graphs are not an elementary class in first-order logic, and there is no formula φ(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) of first-order logic, in the logic of graphs, that expresses the idea that there is a path from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;. Connectedness can be expressed in second-order logic, however, but not with only existential set quantifiers, as formula_113 also enjoys compactness.

===Lindström&#x27;s theorem===
Per Lindström showed that the metalogical properties just discussed actually characterize first-order logic in the sense that no stronger logic can also have those properties (Ebbinghaus and Flum 1994, Chapter XIII). Lindström defined a class of abstract logical systems, and a rigorous definition of the relative strength of a member of this class. He established two theorems for systems of this type:
* A logical system satisfying Lindström&#x27;s definition that contains first-order logic and satisfies both the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem must be equivalent to first-order logic.
* A logical system satisfying Lindström&#x27;s definition that has a semidecidable logical consequence relation and satisfies the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem must be equivalent to first-order logic.

==Limitations==
Although first-order logic is sufficient for formalizing much of mathematics and is commonly used in computer science and other fields, it has certain limitations. These include limitations on its expressiveness and limitations of the fragments of natural languages that it can describe.

For instance, first-order logic is undecidable, meaning a sound, complete and terminating decision algorithm for provability is impossible. This has led to the study of interesting decidable fragments, such as C2: first-order logic with two variables and the counting quantifiers formula_114 and formula_115.

===Expressiveness===
The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that if a first-order theory has any infinite model, then it has infinite models of every cardinality. In particular, no first-order theory with an infinite model can be categorical. Thus, there is no first-order theory whose only model has the set of natural numbers as its domain, or whose only model has the set of real numbers as its domain. Many extensions of first-order logic, including infinitary logics and higher-order logics, are more expressive in the sense that they do permit categorical axiomatizations of the natural numbers or real numbers. This expressiveness comes at a metalogical cost, however: by Lindström&#x27;s theorem, the compactness theorem and the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem cannot hold in any logic stronger than first-order.

===Formalizing natural languages===

First-order logic is able to formalize many simple quantifier constructions in natural language, such as &quot;every person who lives in Perth lives in Australia&quot;. Hence, first-order logic is used as a basis for knowledge representation languages, such as FO(.).

Still, there are complicated features of natural language that cannot be expressed in first-order logic. &quot;Any logical system which is appropriate as an instrument for the analysis of natural language needs a much richer structure than first-order predicate logic&quot;.

==Restrictions, extensions, and variations==
There are many variations of first-order logic. Some of these are inessential in the sense that they merely change notation without affecting the semantics. Others change the expressive power more significantly, by extending the semantics through additional quantifiers or other new logical symbols. For example, infinitary logics permit formulas of infinite size, and modal logics add symbols for possibility and necessity.

===Restricted languages===
First-order logic can be studied in languages with fewer logical symbols than were described above:
* Because formula_55 can be expressed as formula_117, and formula_61 can be expressed as formula_119, either of the two quantifiers formula_120 and formula_121 can be dropped.
* Since formula_122 can be expressed as formula_123 and formula_124 can be expressed as formula_125, either formula_126 or formula_26 can be dropped. In other words, it is sufficient to have formula_128 and formula_126, or formula_128 and formula_26, as the only logical connectives.
* Similarly, it is sufficient to have only formula_128 and formula_25 as logical connectives, or to have only the Sheffer stroke (NAND) or the Peirce arrow (NOR) operator.
* It is possible to entirely avoid function symbols and constant symbols, rewriting them via predicate symbols in an appropriate way. For example, instead of using a constant symbol formula_134 one may use a predicate formula_135 (interpreted as formula_136 ) and replace every predicate such as formula_137 with formula_138. A function such as formula_139 will similarly be replaced by a predicate formula_140 interpreted as formula_141. This change requires adding additional axioms to the theory at hand, so that interpretations of the predicate symbols used have the correct semantics.

Restrictions such as these are useful as a technique to reduce the number of inference rules or axiom schemas in deductive systems, which leads to shorter proofs of metalogical results. The cost of the restrictions is that it becomes more difficult to express natural-language statements in the formal system at hand, because the logical connectives used in the natural language statements must be replaced by their (longer) definitions in terms of the restricted collection of logical connectives. Similarly, derivations in the limited systems may be longer than derivations in systems that include additional connectives. There is thus a trade-off between the ease of working within the formal system and the ease of proving results about the formal system.

It is also possible to restrict the arities of function symbols and predicate symbols, in sufficiently expressive theories. One can in principle dispense entirely with functions of arity greater than 2 and predicates of arity greater than 1 in theories that include a pairing function. This is a function of arity 2 that takes pairs of elements of the domain and returns an ordered pair containing them. It is also sufficient to have two predicate symbols of arity 2 that define projection functions from an ordered pair to its components. In either case it is necessary that the natural axioms for a pairing function and its projections are satisfied.

===Many-sorted logic===

Ordinary first-order interpretations have a single domain of discourse over which all quantifiers range. &quot;Many-sorted first-order logic&quot; allows variables to have different &quot;sorts&quot;, which have different domains. This is also called &quot;typed first-order logic&quot;, and the sorts called &quot;types&quot; (as in data type), but it is not the same as first-order type theory. Many-sorted first-order logic is often used in the study of second-order arithmetic.

When there are only finitely many sorts in a theory, many-sorted first-order logic can be reduced to single-sorted first-order logic.
One introduces into the single-sorted theory a unary predicate symbol for each sort in the many-sorted theory and adds an axiom saying that these unary predicates partition the domain of discourse. For example, if there are two sorts, one adds predicate symbols formula_142 and formula_143 and the axiom:
:formula_144.
Then the elements satisfying formula_145 are thought of as elements of the first sort, and elements satisfying formula_146 as elements of the second sort. One can quantify over each sort by using the corresponding predicate symbol to limit the range of quantification. For example, to say there is an element of the first sort satisfying formula formula_147, one writes:
:formula_148.

===Additional quantifiers===
Additional quantifiers can be added to first-order logic.
* Sometimes it is useful to say that &quot; holds for exactly one &quot;x&quot;&quot;, which can be expressed as . This notation, called uniqueness quantification, may be taken to abbreviate a formula such as .
*&quot;First-order logic with extra quantifiers&quot; has new quantifiers &quot;Qx&quot;..., with meanings such as &quot;there are many &quot;x&quot; such that ...&quot;. Also see branching quantifiers and the plural quantifiers of George Boolos and others.
* &quot;Bounded quantifiers&quot; are often used in the study of set theory or arithmetic.

===Infinitary logics===

Infinitary logic allows infinitely long sentences. For example, one may allow a conjunction or disjunction of infinitely many formulas, or quantification over infinitely many variables. Infinitely long sentences arise in areas of mathematics including topology and model theory.

Infinitary logic generalizes first-order logic to allow formulas of infinite length. The most common way in which formulas can become infinite is through infinite conjunctions and disjunctions. However, it is also possible to admit generalized signatures in which function and relation symbols are allowed to have infinite arities, or in which quantifiers can bind infinitely many variables. Because an infinite formula cannot be represented by a finite string, it is necessary to choose some other representation of formulas; the usual representation in this context is a tree. Thus, formulas are, essentially, identified with their parse trees, rather than with the strings being parsed.

The most commonly studied infinitary logics are denoted &quot;L&quot;αβ, where α and β are each either cardinal numbers or the symbol ∞. In this notation, ordinary first-order logic is &quot;L&quot;ωω.
In the logic &quot;L&quot;∞ω, arbitrary conjunctions or disjunctions are allowed when building formulas, and there is an unlimited supply of variables. More generally, the logic that permits conjunctions or disjunctions with less than κ constituents is known as &quot;L&quot;κω. For example, &quot;L&quot;ω1ω permits countable conjunctions and disjunctions.

The set of free variables in a formula of &quot;L&quot;κω can have any cardinality strictly less than κ, yet only finitely many of them can be in the scope of any quantifier when a formula appears as a subformula of another. In other infinitary logics, a subformula may be in the scope of infinitely many quantifiers. For example, in &quot;L&quot;κ∞, a single universal or existential quantifier may bind arbitrarily many variables simultaneously. Similarly, the logic &quot;L&quot;κλ permits simultaneous quantification over fewer than λ variables, as well as conjunctions and disjunctions of size less than κ.

===Non-classical and modal logics===

*&quot;Intuitionistic first-order logic&quot; uses intuitionistic rather than classical reasoning; for example, ¬¬φ need not be equivalent to φ and ¬ ∀x.φ is in general not equivalent to ∃ x.¬φ .
*First-order &quot;modal logic&quot; allows one to describe other possible worlds as well as this contingently true world which we inhabit. In some versions, the set of possible worlds varies depending on which possible world one inhabits. Modal logic has extra &quot;modal operators&quot; with meanings which can be characterized informally as, for example &quot;it is necessary that φ&quot; (true in all possible worlds) and &quot;it is possible that φ&quot; (true in some possible world). With standard first-order logic we have a single domain, and each predicate is assigned one extension. With first-order modal logic we have a &quot;domain function&quot; that assigns each possible world its own domain, so that each predicate gets an extension only relative to these possible worlds. This allows us to model cases where, for example, Alex is a philosopher, but might have been a mathematician, and might not have existed at all. In the first possible world &quot;P&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is true, in the second &quot;P&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is false, and in the third possible world there is no &quot;a&quot; in the domain at all.
*&quot;First-order fuzzy logics&quot; are first-order extensions of propositional fuzzy logics rather than classical propositional calculus.

===Fixpoint logic===

Fixpoint logic extends first-order logic by adding the closure under the least fixed points of positive operators.

===Higher-order logics===
The characteristic feature of first-order logic is that individuals can be quantified, but not predicates. Thus
:formula_149
is a legal first-order formula, but
:formula_150
is not, in most formalizations of first-order logic. Second-order logic extends first-order logic by adding the latter type of quantification. Other higher-order logics allow quantification over even higher types than second-order logic permits. These higher types include relations between relations, functions from relations to relations between relations, and other higher-type objects. Thus the &quot;first&quot; in first-order logic describes the type of objects that can be quantified.

Unlike first-order logic, for which only one semantics is studied, there are several possible semantics for second-order logic. The most commonly employed semantics for second-order and higher-order logic is known as &quot;full semantics&quot;. The combination of additional quantifiers and the full semantics for these quantifiers makes higher-order logic stronger than first-order logic. In particular, the (semantic) logical consequence relation for second-order and higher-order logic is not semidecidable; there is no effective deduction system for second-order logic that is sound and complete under full semantics.

Second-order logic with full semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, it is possible to create axiom systems in second-order logic that uniquely characterize the natural numbers and the real line. The cost of this expressiveness is that second-order and higher-order logics have fewer attractive metalogical properties than first-order logic. For example, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and compactness theorem of first-order logic become false when generalized to higher-order logics with full semantics.

==Automated theorem proving and formal methods==
Automated theorem proving refers to the development of computer programs that search and find derivations (formal proofs) of mathematical theorems. Finding derivations is a difficult task because the search space can be very large; an exhaustive search of every possible derivation is theoretically possible but computationally infeasible for many systems of interest in mathematics. Thus complicated heuristic functions are developed to attempt to find a derivation in less time than a blind search.

The related area of automated proof verification uses computer programs to check that human-created proofs are correct. Unlike complicated automated theorem provers, verification systems may be small enough that their correctness can be checked both by hand and through automated software verification. This validation of the proof verifier is needed to give confidence that any derivation labeled as &quot;correct&quot; is actually correct.

Some proof verifiers, such as Metamath, insist on having a complete derivation as input. Others, such as Mizar and Isabelle, take a well-formatted proof sketch (which may still be very long and detailed) and fill in the missing pieces by doing simple proof searches or applying known decision procedures: the resulting derivation is then verified by a small core &quot;kernel&quot;. Many such systems are primarily intended for interactive use by human mathematicians: these are known as proof assistants. They may also use formal logics that are stronger than first-order logic, such as type theory. Because a full derivation of any nontrivial result in a first-order deductive system will be extremely long for a human to write, results are often formalized as a series of lemmas, for which derivations can be constructed separately.

Automated theorem provers are also used to implement formal verification in computer science. In this setting, theorem provers are used to verify the correctness of programs and of hardware such as processors with respect to a formal specification. Because such analysis is time-consuming and thus expensive, it is usually reserved for projects in which a malfunction would have grave human or financial consequences.

For the problem of model checking, efficient algorithms are known to decide whether an input finite structure satisfies a first-order formula, in addition to computational complexity bounds: see .

<text>In mathematics, specifically category theory, a functor is a mapping between categories. Functors were first considered in algebraic topology, where algebraic objects (such as the fundamental group) are associated to topological spaces, and maps between these algebraic objects are associated to continuous maps between spaces. Nowadays, functors are used throughout modern mathematics to relate various categories. Thus, functors are important in all areas within mathematics to which category theory is applied.

The words &quot;category&quot; and &quot;functor&quot; were borrowed by mathematicians from the philosophers Aristotle and Rudolf Carnap, respectively. The latter used &quot;functor&quot; in a linguistic context;
see function word.

== Definition ==

Let &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; be categories. A functor &quot;F&quot; from &quot;C&quot; to &quot;D&quot; is a mapping that
* associates each object formula_1 in &quot;C&quot; to an object formula_2 in &quot;D&quot;,
* associates each morphism formula_3 in &quot;C&quot; to a morphism formula_4 in &quot;D&quot; such that the following two conditions hold:
** formula_5 for every object formula_1 in &quot;C&quot;,
** formula_7 for all morphisms formula_8 and formula_9 in &quot;C&quot;.

That is, functors must preserve identity morphisms and composition of morphisms.

=== Covariance and contravariance ===

There are many constructions in mathematics that would be functors but for the fact that they &quot;turn morphisms around&quot; and &quot;reverse composition&quot;. We then define a contravariant functor &quot;F&quot; from &quot;C&quot; to &quot;D&quot; as a mapping that
*associates each object formula_1 in &quot;C&quot; with an object formula_2 in &quot;D&quot;,
*associates each morphism formula_12 in &quot;C&quot; with a morphism formula_13 in &quot;D&quot; such that the following two conditions hold:
**formula_14 for every object formula_1 in &quot;C&quot;,
**formula_16 for all morphisms formula_12 and formula_9 in &quot;C&quot;.

Variance of functor (composite)
*The composite of two functors of the same variance:
**formula_19
**formula_20
*The composite of two functors of opposite variance:
**formula_21
**formula_22

Note that contravariant functors reverse the direction of composition.

Ordinary functors are also called covariant functors in order to distinguish them from contravariant ones. Note that one can also define a contravariant functor as a &quot;covariant&quot; functor on the opposite category formula_23. Some authors prefer to write all expressions covariantly. That is, instead of saying formula_24 is a contravariant functor, they simply write formula_25 (or sometimes formula_26) and call it a functor.

Contravariant functors are also occasionally called &quot;cofunctors&quot;.

There is a convention which refers to &quot;vectors&quot;—i.e., vector fields, elements of the space of sections formula_27 of a tangent bundle formula_28—as &quot;contravariant&quot; and to &quot;covectors&quot;—i.e., 1-forms, elements of the space of sections formula_29 of a cotangent bundle formula_30—as &quot;covariant&quot;. This terminology originates in physics, and its rationale has to do with the position of the indices (&quot;upstairs&quot; and &quot;downstairs&quot;) in expressions such as formula_31 for formula_32 or formula_33 for formula_34 In this formalism it is observed that the coordinate transformation symbol formula_35 (representing the matrix formula_36) acts on the &quot;covector coordinates&quot; &quot;in the same way&quot; as on the basis vectors: formula_37—whereas it acts &quot;in the opposite way&quot; on the &quot;vector coordinates&quot; (but &quot;in the same way&quot; as on the basis covectors: formula_38). This terminology is contrary to the one used in category theory because it is the covectors that have &quot;pullbacks&quot; in general and are thus &quot;contravariant&quot;, whereas vectors in general are &quot;covariant&quot; since they can be &quot;pushed forward&quot;. See also Covariance and contravariance of vectors.

=== Opposite functor ===
Every functor formula_24 induces the opposite functor formula_40, where formula_23 and formula_42 are the opposite categories to formula_43 and formula_44. By definition, formula_45 maps objects and morphisms in the identical way as does formula_46. Since formula_23 does not coincide with formula_43 as a category, and similarly for formula_44, formula_45 is distinguished from formula_46. For example, when composing formula_52 with formula_53, one should use either formula_54 or formula_55. Note that, following the property of opposite category, formula_56.

=== Bifunctors and multifunctors ===
A bifunctor (also known as a binary functor) is a functor whose domain is a product category. For example, the Hom functor is of the type . It can be seen as a functor in &quot;two&quot; arguments; it is contravariant in one argument, covariant in the other.

A multifunctor is a generalization of the functor concept to &quot;n&quot; variables. So, for example, a bifunctor is a multifunctor with .

== Properties ==
Two important consequences of the functor axioms are:
* &quot;F&quot; transforms each commutative diagram in &quot;C&quot; into a commutative diagram in &quot;D&quot;;
* if &quot;f&quot; is an isomorphism in &quot;C&quot;, then &quot;F&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) is an isomorphism in &quot;D&quot;.

One can compose functors, i.e. if &quot;F&quot; is a functor from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; and &quot;G&quot; is a functor from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;C&quot; then one can form the composite functor from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;C&quot;. Composition of functors is associative where defined. Identity of composition of functors is the identity functor. This shows that functors can be considered as morphisms in categories of categories, for example in the category of small categories.

A small category with a single object is the same thing as a monoid: the morphisms of a one-object category can be thought of as elements of the monoid, and composition in the category is thought of as the monoid operation. Functors between one-object categories correspond to monoid homomorphisms. So in a sense, functors between arbitrary categories are a kind of generalization of monoid homomorphisms to categories with more than one object.

== Examples ==
; Diagram: For categories &quot;C&quot; and &quot;J&quot;, a diagram of type &quot;J&quot; in &quot;C&quot; is a covariant functor formula_57.
; (Category theoretical) presheaf:For categories &quot;C&quot; and &quot;J&quot;, a &quot;J&quot;-presheaf on &quot;C&quot; is a contravariant functor formula_58.In the special case when J is Set, the category of sets and functions, &quot;D&quot; is called a presheaf on &quot;C&quot;.
; Presheaves (over a topological space): If &quot;X&quot; is a topological space, then the open sets in &quot;X&quot; form a partially ordered set Open(&quot;X&quot;) under inclusion. Like every partially ordered set, Open(&quot;X&quot;) forms a small category by adding a single arrow if and only if formula_59. Contravariant functors on Open(&quot;X&quot;) are called &quot;presheaves&quot; on &quot;X&quot;. For instance, by assigning to every open set &quot;U&quot; the associative algebra of real-valued continuous functions on &quot;U&quot;, one obtains a presheaf of algebras on &quot;X&quot;.
; Constant functor: The functor which maps every object of &quot;C&quot; to a fixed object &quot;X&quot; in &quot;D&quot; and every morphism in &quot;C&quot; to the identity morphism on &quot;X&quot;. Such a functor is called a &quot;constant&quot; or &quot;selection&quot; functor.
; : A functor that maps a category to that same category; e.g., polynomial functor.
; : In category &quot;C&quot;, written 1&quot;C&quot; or id&quot;C&quot;, maps an object to itself and a morphism to itself. The identity functor is an endofunctor.
; Diagonal functor: The diagonal functor is defined as the functor from &quot;D&quot; to the functor category &quot;D&quot;&quot;C&quot; which sends each object in &quot;D&quot; to the constant functor at that object.
; Limit functor: For a fixed index category &quot;J&quot;, if every functor has a limit (for instance if &quot;C&quot; is complete), then the limit functor assigns to each functor its limit. The existence of this functor can be proved by realizing that it is the right-adjoint to the diagonal functor and invoking the Freyd adjoint functor theorem. This requires a suitable version of the axiom of choice. Similar remarks apply to the colimit functor (which assigns to every functor its colimit, and is covariant).
; Power sets functor: The power set functor maps each set to its power set and each function formula_60 to the map which sends formula_61 to its image formula_62. One can also consider the contravariant power set functor which sends formula_63 to the map which sends formula_64 to its inverse image formula_65 For example, if formula_66 then formula_67. Suppose formula_68 and formula_69. Then formula_70 is the function which sends any subset formula_71 of formula_1 to its image formula_73, which in this case means formula_74, where formula_75 denotes the mapping under formula_70, so this could also be written as formula_77. For the other values,formula_78 formula_79 formula_80 Note that formula_81 consequently generates the trivial topology on formula_1. Also note that although the function formula_83 in this example mapped to the power set of formula_1, that need not be the case in general.
; : The map which assigns to every vector space its dual space and to every linear map its dual or transpose is a contravariant functor from the category of all vector spaces over a fixed field to itself.
; Fundamental group: Consider the category of pointed topological spaces, i.e. topological spaces with distinguished points. The objects are pairs , where &quot;X&quot; is a topological space and &quot;x&quot;0 is a point in &quot;X&quot;. A morphism from to is given by a continuous map with . To every topological space &quot;X&quot; with distinguished point &quot;x&quot;0, one can define the fundamental group based at &quot;x&quot;0, denoted . This is the group of homotopy classes of loops based at &quot;x&quot;0, with the group operation of concatenation. If is a morphism of pointed spaces, then every loop in &quot;X&quot; with base point &quot;x&quot;0 can be composed with &quot;f&quot; to yield a loop in &quot;Y&quot; with base point &quot;y&quot;0. This operation is compatible with the homotopy equivalence relation and the composition of loops, and we get a group homomorphism from to . We thus obtain a functor from the category of pointed topological spaces to the category of groups. In the category of topological spaces (without distinguished point), one considers homotopy classes of generic curves, but they cannot be composed unless they share an endpoint. Thus one has the fundamental groupoid instead of the fundamental group, and this construction is functorial.
; Algebra of continuous functions: A contravariant functor from the category of topological spaces (with continuous maps as morphisms) to the category of real associative algebras is given by assigning to every topological space &quot;X&quot; the algebra C(&quot;X&quot;) of all real-valued continuous functions on that space. Every continuous map induces an algebra homomorphism by the rule for every &quot;φ&quot; in C(&quot;Y&quot;).
; Tangent and cotangent bundles: The map which sends every differentiable manifold to its tangent bundle and every smooth map to its derivative is a covariant functor from the category of differentiable manifolds to the category of vector bundles. Doing this constructions pointwise gives the tangent space, a covariant functor from the category of pointed differentiable manifolds to the category of real vector spaces. Likewise, cotangent space is a contravariant functor, essentially the composition of the tangent space with the dual space above.
; Group actions/representations: Every group &quot;G&quot; can be considered as a category with a single object whose morphisms are the elements of &quot;G&quot;. A functor from &quot;G&quot; to Set is then nothing but a group action of &quot;G&quot; on a particular set, i.e. a &quot;G&quot;-set. Likewise, a functor from &quot;G&quot; to the category of vector spaces, Vect&quot;K&quot;, is a linear representation of &quot;G&quot;. In general, a functor can be considered as an &quot;action&quot; of &quot;G&quot; on an object in the category &quot;C&quot;. If &quot;C&quot; is a group, then this action is a group homomorphism.
; Lie algebras: Assigning to every real (complex) Lie group its real (complex) Lie algebra defines a functor.
; Tensor products: If &quot;C&quot; denotes the category of vector spaces over a fixed field, with linear maps as morphisms, then the tensor product formula_85 defines a functor which is covariant in both arguments.
; Forgetful functors: The functor which maps a group to its underlying set and a group homomorphism to its underlying function of sets is a functor. Functors like these, which &quot;forget&quot; some structure, are termed &quot;forgetful functors&quot;. Another example is the functor which maps a ring to its underlying additive abelian group. Morphisms in Rng (ring homomorphisms) become morphisms in Ab (abelian group homomorphisms).
; Free functors: Going in the opposite direction of forgetful functors are free functors. The free functor sends every set &quot;X&quot; to the free group generated by &quot;X&quot;. Functions get mapped to group homomorphisms between free groups. Free constructions exist for many categories based on structured sets. See free object.
; Homomorphism groups: To every pair &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; of abelian groups one can assign the abelian group Hom(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) consisting of all group homomorphisms from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;. This is a functor which is contravariant in the first and covariant in the second argument, i.e. it is a functor (where Ab denotes the category of abelian groups with group homomorphisms). If and are morphisms in Ab, then the group homomorphism : is given by . See Hom functor.
; Representable functors: We can generalize the previous example to any category &quot;C&quot;. To every pair &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; of objects in &quot;C&quot; one can assign the set of morphisms from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;. This defines a functor to Set which is contravariant in the first argument and covariant in the second, i.e. it is a functor . If and are morphisms in &quot;C&quot;, then the map is given by . Functors like these are called representable functors. An important goal in many settings is to determine whether a given functor is representable.

== Relation to other categorical concepts ==
Let &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; be categories. The collection of all functors from &quot;C&quot; to &quot;D&quot; forms the objects of a category: the functor category. Morphisms in this category are natural transformations between functors.

Functors are often defined by universal properties; examples are the tensor product, the direct sum and direct product of groups or vector spaces, construction of free groups and modules, direct and inverse limits. The concepts of limit and colimit generalize several of the above.

Universal constructions often give rise to pairs of adjoint functors.

== Computer implementations ==

Functors sometimes appear in functional programming. For instance, the programming language Haskell has a class codice_1 where codice_2 is a polytypic function used to map functions (&quot;morphisms&quot; on &quot;Hask&quot;, the category of Haskell types) between existing types to functions between some new types.

<text>Felix Hausdorff ( , ; November 8, 1868 – January 26, 1942) was a German mathematician, pseudonym Paul Mongré (&quot;à mon gré&quot; (Fr.) = &quot;according to my taste&quot;), who is considered to be one of the founders of modern topology and who contributed significantly to set theory, descriptive set theory, measure theory, and functional analysis.

Hausdorff was Jewish, and life became difficult for him and his family after the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; of 1938. The next year he initiated efforts to emigrate to the United States, but was unable to make arrangements to receive a research fellowship. On 26 January 1942, Hausdorff, along with his wife and his sister-in-law, died by suicide by taking an overdose of veronal, rather than comply with German orders to move to the Endenich camp, and there suffer the likely implications, about which he held no illusions.

==Life==

===Childhood and youth===
Hausdorff&#x27;s father, the Jewish merchant Louis Hausdorff (1843–1896), moved with his young family to Leipzig in the autumn of 1870, and over time worked at various companies, including a linen-and cotton goods factory. He was an educated man and had become a Morenu at the age of 14. He wrote several treatises, including a long work on the Aramaic translations of the Bible from the perspective of Talmudic law.

Hausdorff&#x27;s mother, Hedwig (1848–1902), who is also referred to in various documents as Johanna, came from the Jewish Tietz family. From another branch of this family came Hermann Tietz, founder of the first department store, and later co-owner of the department store chain called &quot;Hermann Tietz&quot;. During the period of Nazi dictatorship the name was &quot;Aryanised&quot; to Hertie.

From 1878 to 1887 Felix Hausdorff attended the Nicolai School in Leipzig, a facility that had a reputation as a hotbed of humanistic education. He was an excellent student, class leader for many years and often recited self-written Latin or German poems at school celebrations.

In his later years of high school, choosing a main subject of study was not easy for Hausdorff. Magda Dierkesmann, who was often a guest in the home of Hausdorff in the years 1926–1932, reported in 1967 that:

He decided to study the natural sciences, and in his graduating class of 1887 he was the only one who achieved the highest possible grade.

===Degree, doctorate and Habilitation===

From 1887 to 1891 Hausdorff studied mathematics and astronomy, mainly in his native city of Leipzig, interrupted by one semester in Freiburg (summer 1888) and Berlin (winter 1888/1889). Surviving testimony from other students depict him as an extremely versatile and interested young man, who, in addition to the mathematical and astronomical lectures, attended lectures in physics, chemistry and geography, and also lectures on philosophy and history of philosophy, as well as on issues of language, literature and social sciences. In Leipzig he attended lectures on the history of music from musicologist Oscar Paul. His early love of music lasted a lifetime; in Hausdorff&#x27;s home he held impressive musical evenings with the landlord at the piano, according to witness statements made by various participants. Even as a student in Leipzig, he was an admirer and connoisseur of the music of Richard Wagner.

In later semesters of his studies, Hausdorff was close to Heinrich Bruns (1848–1919). 
Bruns was professor of astronomy and director of the observatory at the University of Leipzig. Under his supervision, Hausdorff graduated in 1891 with a work on the theory of astronomical refraction of light in the atmosphere. Two publications on the same subject followed, and in 1895 his Habilitation also followed with a thesis on the absorbance of light in the atmosphere. These early astronomical works of Hausdorff, despite their excellent mathematical formulation, were ultimately of little importance to the scientific community.
For one, the underlying idea of Bruns was later shown to not be viable (there was a need for refraction observations near the astronomical horizon, and as Julius Bauschinger would show, this could not be obtained with the required accuracy). And further, the progress in the direct measurement of atmospheric data (from weather balloon ascents) has since made the painstaking accuracy of this data from refraction observations unnecessary. In the time between defending his PhD and his Habilitation, Hausdorff completed his yearlong military requirement, and worked for two years as a human computer at the observatory in Leipzig.

===Lecturer in Leipzig===
After his Habilitation, Hausdorff became a lecturer at the University of Leipzig where he began extensive teaching in a variety of mathematical areas. In addition to teaching and research in mathematics, he also pursued his literary and philosophical inclinations. A man of varied interests, he often associated with a number of famous writers, artists and publishers such as Hermann Conradi, Richard Dehmel, Otto Erich Hartleben, Gustav Kirstein, Max Klinger, Max Reger and Frank Wedekind. The years of 1897 to 1904 mark the high point of his literary and philosophical creativity, during which time 18 of his 22 pseudonymous works were published, including a book of poetry, a play, an epistemological book and a volume of aphorisms.

In 1899 Hausdorff married Charlotte Goldschmidt, the daughter of Jewish doctor Siegismund Goldschmidt. Her stepmother was the famous suffragist and preschool teacher Henriette Goldschmidt. Hausdorff&#x27;s only child, his daughter Lenore (Nora), was born in 1900; she survived the era of National Socialism and enjoyed a long life, dying in Bonn in 1991.

===First professorship===
In December 1901 Hausdorff was appointed as adjunct associate professor at the University of Leipzig. An often-repeated factoid, that Hausdorff got a call from Göttingen and rejected it, cannot be verified and is most likely wrong. After considering Hausdorff&#x27;s application to Leipzig, the Dean Kirchner felt compelled to make the following addition to the very positive vote from his colleagues, written by Heinrich Bruns:

This quote emphasizes the undisguised antisemitism present, which especially took a sharp upturn throughout the German Reich after the stock market crash of 1873. Leipzig was a focus of antisemitic sentiment, especially among the student body, which may well be the reason that Hausdorff did not feel at ease in Leipzig. Another contributing factor may also have been the stresses due to the hierarchical posturing of the Leipzig professors.

After his Habilitation, Hausdorff wrote other works on optics, on non-Euclidean geometry, and on hypercomplex number systems, as well as two papers on probability theory. However, his main area of work soon became set theory, especially the theory of ordered sets. Initially, it was only out of philosophical interest that Hausdorff began to study Georg Cantor&#x27;s work, beginning around 1897, but already in 1901 Hausdorff began lecturing on set theory. His was one of the first ever lectures on set theory; only Ernst Zermelo&#x27;s lectures in Göttingen College during the winter of 1900/1901 were earlier. That same year, he published his first paper on order types in which he examined a generalization of well-orderings called graded order types, where a linear order is graded if no two of its segments share the same order type. He generalized the Cantor–Bernstein theorem, which said the collection of countable order types has the cardinality of the continuum and showed that the collection of all graded types of an idempotent cardinality has a cardinality of 2.

For the summer semester of 1910 Hausdorff was appointed as professor to the University of Bonn. There he began a lecture series on set theory, which he substantially revised and expanded for the summer semester of 1912.

In the summer of 1912 he also began work on his magnum opus, the book &quot;Basics of set theory&quot;. It was completed in Greifswald, where Hausdorff had been appointed for the summer semester as full professor in 1913, and was released in April 1914.

The University of Greifswald was the smallest of the Prussian universities. The mathematical institute there was also small; during the summer of 1916 and the winter of 1916/17, Hausdorff was the only mathematician in Greifswald. This meant that he was almost fully occupied in teaching basic courses. It was thus a substantial improvement for his academic career when Hausdorff was appointed in 1921 to Bonn. There he was free to teach about wider ranges of topics, and often lectured on his latest research. He gave a particularly noteworthy lecture on probability theory (NL Hausdorff: Capsule 21: Fasz 64) in the summer semester of 1923, in which he grounded the theory of probability in measure-theoretic axiomatic theory, ten years before A. N. Kolmogorov&#x27;s &quot;Basic concepts of probability theory&quot; (reprinted in full in the collected works, Volume V). In Bonn, Hausdorff was friends and colleagues with Eduard Study, and later with Otto Toeplitz, who were both
outstanding mathematicians.

===Under the Nazi dictatorship and suicide===
After the takeover by the National Socialist party, antisemitism became state doctrine. Hausdorff was not initially concerned by the &quot;Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service&quot;, adopted in 1933, because he had been a German public servant since before 1914. However, he was not completely spared, as one of his lectures was interrupted by National Socialist student officials. In the winter semester of 1934/1935, there was a working session of the National Socialist German Student Union (NSDStB) at the University of Bonn, which chose &quot;Race and Ethnicity&quot; as their theme for the semester. Hausdorff cancelled his 1934/1935 winter semester Calculus III course on 20 November, and it is assumed that the choice of theme was related to the cancellation of Hausdorff&#x27;s class, since in his long career as a university lecturer he had always taught his courses through to their end.

On March 31, 1935, after some back and forth, Hausdorff was finally given emeritus status. No words of thanks were given for his 40 years of successful work in the German higher education system.

His academic legacy shows that Hausdorff was still working mathematically during these increasingly difficult times, and continued to follow current developments of interest. 
He wrote, in addition to the expanded edition of his work on set theory, seven works on topology and descriptive set theory. These were published in Polish magazines: one in &quot;Studia Mathematica&quot;, the others in &quot;Fundamenta Mathematicae&quot;.
He was supported at this time by Erich Bessel-Hagen, a loyal friend to the Hausdorff family who obtained books and magazines from the academic library, which Hausdorff was no longer allowed to enter.

A great deal is known about the humiliations to which Hausdorff and his family especially were exposed to after Kristallnacht in 1938. There are many sources, including the letters of Bessel-Hagen.

In 1939, Hausdorff asked the mathematician Richard Courant, in vain, for a research fellowship to be able to emigrate into the USA. 
In mid-1941, the Bonn Jews began to be deported to the &quot;Monastery for Eternal Adoration&quot; in Endenich, Bonn, from which the nuns had been expelled. Transports to death camps in the east occurred later. After Hausdorff, his wife, and his wife&#x27;s sister, Edith Pappenheim (who was living with them), were ordered in January 1942 to move to the Endenich camp, the three died by suicide on 26 January 1942 by taking an overdose of veronal. Their final resting place is located on the cemetery Poppelsdorf in Bonn. In the time between their placement in temporary camps and his suicide, he gave his handwritten &quot;Nachlass&quot; to the Egyptologist and presbyter Hans Bonnet, who saved as much of them as possible, even despite the destruction of his house by a bomb.

Some of his fellow Jews may have had illusions about the camp Endenich, but not Hausdorff. In the estate of Bessel-Hagen, E. Neuenschwander discovered the farewell letter that Hausdorff wrote to his lawyer Hans Wollstein, who was also Jewish. Here is the beginning and end of the letter:

After thanking friends and, in great composure, expressing his last wishes regarding his funeral and his will, Hausdorff writes:

Unfortunately, this desire was not fulfilled. Hausdorff&#x27;s lawyer, Wollstein, was murdered in Auschwitz.

Hausdorff&#x27;s library was sold by his son-in-law and sole heir, Arthur König. The portions of Hausdorff&#x27;s &quot;Nachlass&quot; which could be saved by Hans Bonnet are now in the university and State Library of Bonn. The &quot;Nachlass&quot; is catalogued.

==Work and reception==

=== Hausdorff as philosopher and writer (Paul Mongré) ===
Hausdorff&#x27;s volume of aphorisms, published in 1897, was his first work published under the pseudonym Paul Mongré. It is entitled &quot;Sant&#x27; Ilario: Thoughts from the landscape of Zarathustra&quot;. The subtitle plays first on the fact that Hausdorff had completed his book during a recovery stay on the Ligurian coast by Genoa and that in this same area, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote the first two parts of &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;; he also alludes to his spiritual closeness to Nietzsche. In an article on Sant&#x27; Ilario in the weekly paper Die Zukunft, Hausdorff acknowledged in his debt to Nietzsche.

Hausdorff was not trying to copy or even exceed Nietzsche. &quot;Of Nietzsche imitation no trace&quot;, says a contemporary review. He follows Nietzsche in an attempt to liberate individual thinking, to take the liberty of questioning outdated standards. Hausdorff maintained critical distance to the late works of Nietzsche. In his essay on the book &quot;The Will to Power&quot; compiled from notes left in the Nietzsche Archive he says:

His critical standard he took from Nietzsche himself,

In 1898—also under the pseudonym Paul Mongré—Hausdorff published an epistemological experiment titled &quot;Chaos in cosmic selection&quot;. The critique of metaphysics put forward in this book had its starting point in Hausdorff&#x27;s confrontation with Nietzsche&#x27;s idea of eternal recurrence. Ultimately, it is about destroying &quot;any&quot; kind of metaphysics. Of the world itself, of the &quot;transcendent core of the world&quot;—as Hausdorff puts it—we know nothing and we can know nothing. We must assume &quot;the world itself&quot; as undetermined and undeterminable, as mere chaos. The world of our experience, our cosmos, is the result of the selections that we have made and will always instinctively make according to our capacity for understanding. Seen from that chaos, all other frameworks, other cosmos, are conceivable. That is to say, from the world of our cosmos, one cannot draw any conclusions about the transcendent world.

In 1904, in the magazine The New Rundschau, Hausdorff&#x27;s play appeared, the one-act play &quot;The doctor of his honor&quot;. It is a crude satire on the duel and on the traditional concepts of honor and nobility of the Prussian officer corps, which in the developing bourgeois society were increasingly anachronistic. &quot;The doctor of his honor&quot; was Hausdorff&#x27;s most popular literary work. In 1914–1918 there were numerous performances in more than thirty cities. Hausdorff later wrote an epilogue to the play, but it was not performed at that time. Only in 2006 did this epilogue have its premier at the annual meeting of the German Mathematical Society in Bonn. In 2021 the first English translation of &quot;The doctor of his honor&quot; was published by The Hausdorff Center for Mathematics in Bonn.

Besides the works mentioned above, Hausdorff also wrote numerous essays that appeared in some of the leading literary magazines of the time. He also wrote a book of poems, &quot;Ecstasy&quot; (1900). Some of his poems were set to music by Austrian composer Joseph Marx.

===Theory of ordered sets===
Hausdorff&#x27;s entrance into a thorough study of ordered sets was prompted in part by Cantor&#x27;s continuum problem: where should the cardinal number formula_1 be placed in the sequence formula_2? In a letter to Hilbert on 29 September 1904, he speaks of this problem, &quot;it has plagued me almost like monomania&quot;. Hausdorff saw a new strategy to attack the problem in the set formula_3. Cantor had suspected formula_4, but had only been able to show that formula_5. While formula_6 is the &quot;number&quot; of possible well-orderings of a countable set, formula_7 had now emerged as the &quot;number&quot; of all possible orders of such an amount. It was natural, therefore, to study systems that are more specific than orders, but more general than well-orderings. Hausdorff did just that in his first volume of 1901, with the publication of theoretical studies of &quot;graded sets&quot;. However, we know from the results of Kurt Gödel and Paul Cohen that this strategy to solve the continuum problem is just as ineffectual as Cantor&#x27;s strategy, which was aimed at generalizing the Cantor–Bendixson principle from closed sets to general uncountable sets.

In 1904 Hausdorff published the recursion named after him, which states that for each non-limit ordinal formula_8 we have formula_9

This formula was, together with a later notion called cofinality introduced by Hausdorff, the basis for all further results for Aleph exponentiation. Hausdorff&#x27;s excellent knowledge of recurrence formulas of this kind also empowered him to uncover an error in Julius König&#x27;s lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1904 in Heidelberg. There König had argued that the continuum cannot be well-ordered, so its cardinality is not an Aleph at all, and thus caused a great stir. The fact that it was Hausdorff who clarified the mistake carries a special significance, since a false impression of the events in Heidelberg lasted for over 50 years.

In the years 1906–1909 Hausdorff did his groundbreaking and fundamental work on ordered sets. Of fundamental importance to the whole theory is the concept of cofinality, which Hausdorff introduced. An ordinal is called regular if it is cofinal with any smaller ordinal; otherwise it is called singular. Hausdorff&#x27;s question, whether there are regular numbers which index a limit ordinal, was the starting point for the theory of inaccessible cardinals. Hausdorff had already noticed that such numbers, if they exist, must be of &quot;exorbitant size&quot;.

The following theorem due to Hausdorff is also of fundamental importance: for each unbounded and ordered dense set formula_10 there are two uniquely determined regular initial numbers formula_11 so that formula_10 is cofinal with formula_13 and coinitial with formula_14 (where * denotes the inverse order). This theorem provides, for example, a technique to characterize elements and gaps in ordered sets.

If formula_15 is a predetermined set of characters (element and gap characters), the question arises whether there are ordered sets whose character set is exactly formula_15. One can easily find a necessary condition for formula_15, but Hausdorff was also able to show that this condition is sufficient. For this one needs a rich reservoir of ordered sets, which Hausdorff was also able to create with his theory of general products and powers. In this reservoir can be found interesting structures like the Hausdorff formula_18 normal-types, in connection with which Hausdorff first formulated the generalized continuum hypothesis. Hausdorff&#x27;s formula_18-sets formed the starting point for the study of the important model theory of saturated structure.

Hausdorff&#x27;s general products and powers of cardinalities led him to study the concept of partially ordered set. The question of whether any ordered subset of a partially ordered set is contained in a maximal ordered subset was answered in the positive by Hausdorff using the well-ordering theorem. This is the Hausdorff maximal principle, which follows from either the well-ordering theorem or the axiom of choice, and as it turned out, is also equivalent to the axiom of choice.

Writing in 1908, Arthur Moritz Schoenflies found in his report on set theory that the newer theory of ordered sets (i.e., that which occurred after Cantor&#x27;s extensions) was almost exclusively due to Hausdorff.

===The &quot;Magnum Opus&quot;: &quot;Principles of set theory&quot;===
According to previous notions, set theory included not only the general set theory and the theory of sets of points, but also dimension and measure theory. Hausdorff&#x27;s textbook was the first to present all of set theory in this broad sense, systematically and with full proofs. Hausdorff was aware of how easily the human mind can err while also seeking for rigor and truth, so in the preface of his work he promises:

This book went far beyond its masterful portrayal of already-known concepts. It also contained a series of important original contributions by the author.

The first few chapters deal with the basic concepts of general set theory. In the beginning Hausdorff provides a detailed set algebra with some pioneering new concepts (differences chain, set rings and set fields, formula_20- and formula_21-systems). The introductory paragraphs on sets and their connections included, for example, the modern set-theoretic notion of functions. Chapters 3 to 5 discussed the classical theory of cardinal numbers, order types and ordinals, and in the sixth chapter &quot;Relations between ordered and well-ordered sets&quot; Hausdorff presents, among other things, the most important results of his own research on ordered sets.

In the chapters on &quot;point sets&quot;—the topological chapters—Hausdorff developed for the first time, based on the known neighborhood axioms, a systematic theory of topological spaces, where in addition he added the separation axiom later named after him. This theory emerges from a comprehensive synthesis of earlier approaches of other mathematicians and Hausdorff&#x27;s own reflections on the problem of space. The concepts and theorems of classical point set theory formula_22 are—as far as possible—transferred to the general case, and thus become part of the newly created general or set-theoretic topology. But Hausdorff not only performed this &quot;translation work&quot;, but he also developed basic construction methods of topology such as core formation (open core, self-dense core) and shell formation (closure), and he works through the fundamental importance of the concept of an open set (called &quot;area&quot; by him) and of the concept of compactness introduced by Fréchet. He also founded and developed the theory of the connected set, particularly through the introduction of the terms &quot;component&quot; and &quot;quasi-component&quot;.

With the first Hausdorff countability axiom, and eventually the second, the considered spaces were gradually further specialized. A large class of spaces satisfying the countable first axiom are metric spaces. They were introduced in 1906 by Fréchet under the name &quot;classes (E)&quot;. The term &quot;metric space&quot; comes from Hausdorff. In &quot;Principles&quot;, he developed the theory of metric spaces and systematically enriched it through a series of new concepts: Hausdorff metric, complete, total boundedness, formula_23-connectivity, reducible sets. Fréchet&#x27;s work is not particularly famous; only through Hausdorff&#x27;s &quot;Principles&quot; did metric spaces become common knowledge to mathematicians.

The chapter on illustrations and the final chapter of &quot;Principles&quot; on measure and integration theory are enriched by the generality of the material and the originality of presentation. Hausdorff&#x27;s mention of the importance of measure theory for probability had great historical effect, despite its laconic brevity. One finds in this chapter the first correct proof of the strong law of large numbers of Émile Borel. Finally, the appendix contains the single most spectacular result of the whole book, namely Hausdorff&#x27;s theorem that one cannot define a volume for all bounded subsets of formula_22 for formula_25. The proof is based on Hausdorff&#x27;s paradoxical ball decomposition, whose production requires the axiom of choice.

During the 20th century, it became the standard to build mathematical theories on axiomatic set theory. The creation of axiomatically founded generalized theories, such as general topology, served among other things to single out the common structural core for various specific cases or regions and then set up an abstract theory, which contained all these parts as special cases. This brought a great success in the form of simplification and harmonization, and ultimately brought with itself an economy of thought. Hausdorff himself highlighted this aspect in the &quot;Principles&quot;. In the topological chapter, the basic concepts are methodologically a pioneering effort, and they paved the way for the development of modern mathematics.

&quot;Principles of set theory&quot; appeared in April 1914, on the eve of the First World War, which dramatically affected scientific life in Europe. Under these circumstances, the effects Hausdorff&#x27;s book on mathematical thought would not be seen for five to six years after its appearance. After the war, a new generation of young researchers set forth to expand on the abundant suggestions that were included in this work. Undoubtedly, topology was the primary focus of attention. The journal &quot;Fundamenta Mathematicae&quot;, founded in Poland in 1920, played a special role in the reception of Hausdorff&#x27;s ideas. It was one of the first mathematical journals with special emphasis on set theory, topology, the theory of real functions, measure and integration theory, functional analysis, logic, and foundations of mathematics. Across this spectrum, a special focus was placed on topology. Hausdorff&#x27;s &quot;Principles&quot; was cited in the very first volume of Fundamenta Mathematicae, and through citation counting its influence continued at a remarkable rate. Of the 558 works (Hausdorff&#x27;s own three works not included), which appeared in the first twenty volumes of Fundamenta Mathematicae from 1920 to 1933, 88 of them cite &quot;Principles&quot;. One must also take into account the fact that, as Hausdorff&#x27;s ideas became increasingly commonplace, so too were they used in a number of works that did not cite them explicitly.

The Russian topological school, founded by Paul Alexandroff and Paul Urysohn, was based heavily on Hausdorff&#x27;s &quot;Principles&quot;. This is shown by the surviving correspondence in Hausdorff&#x27;s Nachlass with Urysohn, and especially Alexandroff and Urysohn&#x27;s &quot;Mémoire sur les multiplicités Cantoriennes&quot;, a work the size of a book, in which Urysohn developed dimension theory and &quot;Principles&quot; is cited no fewer than 60 times.

After the Second World War there was a strong demand for Hausdorff&#x27;s book, and there were three reprints at Chelsea from 1949, 1965 and 1978.

===Descriptive set theory, measure theory and analysis===
In 1916, Alexandroff and Hausdorff independently solved the continuum problem for Borel sets: Every Borel set in a complete separable metric space is either countable or has the cardinality of the continuum. This result generalizes the Cantor–Bendixson theorem that such a statement holds for the closed sets of formula_22. For linear formula_27 sets William Henry Young had proved the result in 1903, for formula_28 sets Hausdorff obtained a corresponding result in 1914 in &quot;Principles&quot;. The theorem of Alexandroff and Hausdorff was a strong impetus for further development of descriptive set theory.

Among the publications of Hausdorff in his time at Greifswald the work &quot;Dimension and outer measure&quot; from 1919 is particularly outstanding. In this work, the concepts were introduced which are now known as Hausdorff measure and the Hausdorff dimension. It has remained highly topical and in later years has been one of the most cited mathematical works from the decade of 1910 to 1920.

The concept of Hausdorff dimension is useful for the characterization and comparison of &quot;highly rugged quantities&quot;. The concepts of &quot;Dimension and outer measure&quot; have experienced applications and further developments in many areas such as in the theory of dynamical systems, geometric measure theory, the theory of self-similar sets and fractals, the theory of stochastic processes, harmonic analysis, potential theory, and number theory.

Significant analytical work of Hausdorff occurred in his second time at Bonn. In &quot;Summation methods and moment sequences I&quot; in 1921, he developed a whole class of summation methods for divergent series, which today are called Hausdorff methods. In Hardy&#x27;s classic &quot;Divergent Series&quot;, an entire chapter is devoted to the Hausdorff method. The classical methods of Hölder and Cesàro proved to be special cases of the Hausdorff method. Every Hausdorff method is given by a moment sequence; in this context Hausdorff gave an elegant solution of the moment problem for a finite interval, bypassing the theory of continued fractions. In his paper &quot;Moment problems for a finite interval&quot; of 1923 he treated more special moment problems, such as those with certain restrictions for generating density formula_29, for instance formula_30. Criteria for solvability and decidability of moment problems occupied Hausdorff for many years, as hundreds of pages of handwritten notes in his Nachlass attest.

A significant contribution to the emerging field of functional analysis in the 1920s was Hausdorff&#x27;s extension of the Riesz-Fischer theorem to formula_31 spaces in his 1923 work &quot;An extension of Parseval&#x27;s theorem on Fourier series&quot;. He proved the inequalities now named after him and W.H. Young. The Hausdorff–Young inequalities became the starting point of major new developments.

Hausdorff&#x27;s book &quot;Set Theory&quot; appeared in 1927. This was declared as a second Edition of &quot;Principles&quot;, but it was actually a completely new book. Since the scale was significantly reduced due to its appearance in Goschen&#x27;s teaching library, large parts of the theory of ordered sets and measures and integration theory were removed. In its preface, Hausdorff writes, &quot;Perhaps even more than these deletions the reader will regret the most that, to further save space in point set theory, I have abandoned the topological point of view through which the first edition has apparently acquired many friends, and focused on the simpler theory of metric spaces&quot;.

In fact, this was an explicit regret of some reviewers of the work. As a kind of compensation Hausdorff showed for the first time the then-current state of descriptive set theory. This fact assured the book almost as intense a reception as &quot;Principles&quot;, especially in Fundamenta Mathematicae. As a textbook it was very popular. In 1935 there was an expanded edition published, and this was reprinted by Dover in 1944. An English translation appeared in 1957 with reprints in 1962 and 1967.

There was also a Russian edition (1937), although it was only partially a faithful translation, and partly a reworking by Alexandroff and Kolmogorov. In this translation the topological point of view again moved to the forefront. In 1928 a review of &quot;Set Theory&quot; was written by Hans Hahn, who perhaps had the danger of German antisemitism in his mind as he closed his discussion with the following sentence:

===His last works===
In 1938, Hausdorff&#x27;s last work &quot;Extension of a continuous map&quot; showed that a continuous function from a closed subset formula_32 of a metric space formula_33 can be extended to all of formula_33 (although the image may need to be extended). As a special case, every homeomorphism from formula_32 can be extended to a homeomorphism from formula_33. This work continued research from earlier years. In 1919, in &quot;About semi-continuous functions and their generalization&quot;, Hausdorff had, among other things, given another proof of the Tietze extension theorem. In 1930, in &quot;Extending a homeomorphism&quot;, he showed the following: Let formula_33 be a metric space, formula_38 a closed subset. If formula_32 is given a new metric without changing the topology, this metric can be extended to the entire space without changing the topology. The work &quot;Graded spaces&quot; appeared in 1935, where Hausdorff discussed spaces which fulfilled the Kuratowski closure axioms up to the axiom of idempotence. These spaces are often also called closure spaces, and Hausdorff used them to study relationships between the Fréchet limit spaces and topological spaces.

==Hausdorff as name-giver==
The name Hausdorff is found throughout mathematics. Among others, these concepts were named after him:
* Hausdorff completion
* Hausdorff convergence
* Hausdorff density
* Hausdorff dimension
* Hausdorff distance
* Hausdorff gap
* Hausdorff maximal principle
* Hausdorff measure
* Hausdorff metric
* Hausdorff moment problem
* Hausdorff paradox
* Hausdorff space
* Hausdorff–Young inequality
* Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula

In the universities of Bonn and Greifswald, these things were named in his honor:
* the Hausdorff Center for Mathematics in Bonn,
* the &quot;Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics&quot; in Bonn, and 
* the &quot;Felix Hausdorff Internationale Begegnungszentrum&quot; in Greifswald.

Besides these, in Bonn there is the Hausdorffstraße (Hausdorff Street), where he first lived. (Haus-Nr. 61). In Greifswald there is a Felix-Hausdorff–Straße, where the Institutes for Biochemistry and Physics are located, among others. Since 2011, there is a &quot;Hausdorffweg&quot; (Hausdorff-Way) in the middle of Leipziger Ortsteil Gohlis.

The Asteroid 24947 Hausdorff was named after him.

<text>Fimbulwinter (from , ) is the immediate prelude to the events of Ragnarök in Norse mythology.

==Etymology==
 comes from Old Norse, meaning &quot;awful, mighty winter&quot;. The prefix &quot;fimbul&quot;, albeit with a largely unknown etymology, means &quot;mighty, giant&quot; etc., so the literal interpretation is &quot;mighty winter&quot;.

==Overview==
Fimbulwinter is the harsh winter that precedes the end of the world and puts an end to all life on Earth. Fimbulwinter is three successive winters, when snow comes in from all directions, without any intervening summer. Innumerable wars follow.

The event is described primarily in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. In the poem , Odin poses the question to Vafþrúðnir as to who of mankind will survive the Fimbulwinter. Vafþrúðnir responds that Líf and Lífþrasir will survive and that they will live in the forest of Hoddmímis holt.

The mythology might be related to the volcanic winter of 536, which resulted in a notable drop in temperature across northern Europe. There have also been several popular ideas about whether the particular piece of mythology has a connection to the climate change that occurred in the Nordic countries at the end of the Nordic Bronze Age from about 650 BC.

In Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and other Nordic countries, the term has been borrowed from Old Norse to refer to an unusually cold and harsh winter.

<text>Frankfurt am Main (; ; &quot;Frank ford on the Main&quot;) is the most populous city in the German state of Hesse. Its 773,068 inhabitants as of 2022 make it the fifth-most populous city in Germany. Located in the foreland of the Taunus on its namesake Main, it forms a continuous conurbation with Offenbach am Main; its urban area has a population of over 2.7 million. The city is the heart of the larger Rhine-Main metropolitan region, which has a population of more than 5.8 million and is Germany&#x27;s second-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr region and the fourth biggest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union. Frankfurt is one of the &quot;de facto&quot; four main capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg), as it is home to the European Central Bank, one of the institutional seats of the European Union, while Frankfurt&#x27;s central business district lies about northwest of the geographic center of the EU at Gadheim in Lower Franconia. Like France and Franconia, the city is named after the Franks. Frankfurt is the largest city in the Rhenish Franconian dialect area.

Frankfurt was a city state, the Free City of Frankfurt, for nearly five centuries, and was one of the most important cities of the Holy Roman Empire, as a site of Imperial coronations; it lost its sovereignty upon the collapse of the empire in 1806, regained it in 1815 and then lost it again in 1866, when it was annexed (though neutral) by the Kingdom of Prussia. It has been part of the state of Hesse since 1945. Frankfurt is culturally, ethnically and religiously diverse, with half of its population, and a majority of its young people, having a migrant background. A quarter of the population consists of foreign nationals, including many expatriates. In 2015, Frankfurt was home to 1,909 ultra high-net-worth individuals, the sixth-highest number of any city. As of 2023, Frankfurt is the 13th-wealthiest city in the world and the third-wealthiest city in Europe (after London and Paris).

Frankfurt is a global hub for commerce, culture, education, tourism and transportation, and is the site of many global and European corporate headquarters. Due to its central location in the former West Germany, Frankfurt Airport became the busiest in Germany, one of the busiest in the world, the airport with the most direct routes in the world, and the primary hub for Lufthansa, the national airline of Germany and Europe&#x27;s largest airline. Frankfurt Central Station is Germany&#x27;s second-busiest railway station after Hamburg Hbf, and Frankfurter Kreuz is the most-heavily used interchange in the EU. Frankfurt is one of the major financial centers of the European continent, with the headquarters of the European Central Bank, , Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Deutsche Bank, DZ Bank, KfW, Commerzbank, DekaBank, Helaba, several cloud and fintech startups, and other institutes. Automotive, technology and research, services, consulting, media and creative industries complement the economic base. Frankfurt&#x27;s DE-CIX is the world&#x27;s largest internet exchange point. Messe Frankfurt is one of the world&#x27;s largest trade fairs. Major fairs include the Music Fair and the Frankfurt Book Fair, the world&#x27;s largest book fair. The city also has 93 consulates, among which the largest is the US Consulate General.

Frankfurt is home to influential educational institutions, including the Goethe University with the Universitätsklinikum Frankfurt (de) (Hesse&#x27;s largest hospital), the FUAS, the FUMPA, and graduate schools like the FSFM. The city is one seat of two seats of the German National Library (alongside Leipzig), the largest library in the German-speaking countries and one of the largest in the world. Its renowned cultural venues include the concert hall Alte Oper, continental Europe&#x27;s largest English theater and many museums, 26 of which line up along the Museumsufer, including the Städel, the Liebieghaus, the German Film Museum (de), the Senckenberg Natural Museum, the Goethe House and the Schirn art venue. Frankfurt&#x27;s skyline is shaped by some of Europe&#x27;s tallest skyscrapers, which has led to the term &quot;Mainhattan&quot;. The city has many notable green areas and parks, including the Wallanlagen, Volkspark Niddatal, Grüneburgpark, the City Forest, two major botanical gardens (the Palmengarten and the Botanical Garden Frankfurt) and the Frankfurt Zoological Garden. Frankfurt is the seat of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund – DFB), is home to the first division association football club Eintracht Frankfurt, the Löwen Frankfurt ice hockey team, and the basketball club Frankfurt Skyliners, and is the venue of the Frankfurt Marathon and the Ironman Germany.

==Distinctions==
Frankfurt is the largest financial hub in continental Europe. It is home to the European Central Bank, , Frankfurt Stock Exchange and several large commercial banks.

The Frankfurt Stock Exchange is one of the world&#x27;s largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and accounts for more than 90 percent of the turnover in the German market.

In 2010, 63 national and 152 international banks had their registered offices in Frankfurt, including Germany&#x27;s major banks, notably Deutsche Bank, DZ Bank, KfW, Deka Bank and Commerzbank, as well as 41 representative offices of international banks.

Frankfurt is considered a global city (alpha world city) as listed by the GaWC group&#x27;s 2012 inventory. Among global cities it was ranked tenth by the Global Power City Index 2011 and 11th by the Global City Competitiveness Index 2012. Among financial hubs, the city was ranked eighth by the International Financial Centers Development Index 2013 and ninth in the 2013 Global Financial Centres Index.

Its central location in Germany and Europe makes Frankfurt a major air, rail, and road transport hub. Frankfurt Airport is one of the world&#x27;s busiest international airports by passenger traffic and the main hub for Germany&#x27;s flag carrier Lufthansa. Frankfurt Central Station is one of the largest rail stations in Europe and the busiest junction operated by Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway company, with 342 trains a day to domestic and European destinations. Frankfurter Kreuz, also known as the Autobahn interchange and located close to the airport, is the most-heavily used interchange in the EU, used by 320,000 cars daily. In 2011 human-resource-consulting firm Mercer ranked Frankfurt as seventh in its annual &#x27;Quality of Living&#x27; survey of cities around the world. According to &quot;The Economist&quot; cost-of-living survey, Frankfurt is Germany&#x27;s most expensive city and the world&#x27;s tenth most expensive.

Frankfurt has many downtown high-rise buildings that form its renowned Frankfurt skyline. In fact, it is one of the few cities in the European Union (EU) to have such a skyline, which is why Germans sometimes refer to Frankfurt as Mainhattan, combining the local river Main and &quot;Manhattan&quot;. The other well-known nickname is Bankfurt. Before World War II, the city was noted for its unique old town, the largest timber-framed old town in Europe. The Römer area was later rebuilt and is popular with visitors and for events such as Frankfurt Christmas Market. Other parts of the old town were reconstructed as part of the Dom-Römer Project from 2012 to 2018.

==Etymology==
 (in Old High German) or (in Latin) were the first names mentioned in written records from 794. It transformed to &quot;Frankenfort&quot; during the Middle Ages and then to &quot;Franckfort&quot; and &quot;Franckfurth&quot; in the modern era. According to historian David Gans, the city was named by its builder, a Frankish king named Zuna, who ruled over the province then known as Sicambri. He hoped thereby to perpetuate the name of his lineage. This is chronologically incompatible, however, with the archaeologically demonstrated Roman occupation of the area around Nida fortress in modern Heddernheim. The name is derived from the &quot;Franconofurd&quot; of the Germanic tribe of the Franks; &quot;Furt&quot; (cf. English &quot;ford&quot;) where the river was shallow enough to be crossed on foot.

By the 19th century, the name &quot;Frankfurt&quot; had been established as the official spelling. The older English spelling of &quot;Frankfort&quot; is now rarely seen in reference to Frankfurt am Main, although more than a dozen other towns and cities, mainly in the United States, use this spelling, including Frankfort, Kentucky, Frankfort, New York, and Frankfort, Illinois. &quot;The New York Times&quot; first used the Frankfurt spelling for Frankfurt am Main on 24 October 1953 and last used the Frankfort spelling on 10 June 1954.

The suffix &quot;am Main&quot; has been used regularly since the 14th century. In English, the city&#x27;s full name of &quot;Frankfurt am Main&quot; means &quot;Frankfurt on the Main&quot; (pronounced like English &quot;mine&quot; or German ). Frankfurt is located on an ancient ford (German: &quot;&quot;) on the river Main. As a part of early Franconia, the inhabitants were the early Franks, thus the city&#x27;s name reveals its legacy as &quot;the ford of the Franks on the Main&quot;.

Among English speakers, the city is commonly known simply as Frankfurt, but Germans occasionally call it by its full name to distinguish it from the other (significantly smaller) German city of Frankfurt an der Oder in the &quot;Land&quot; of Brandenburg on the Polish border.

The city district Bonames has a name probably dating back to Roman times, thought to be derived from &quot;&quot; (good table).

The common abbreviations for the city, primarily used in railway services and on road signs, are &quot;Frankfurt (Main)&quot;, &quot;Frankfurt (M)&quot;, &quot;Frankfurt a. M.&quot;, &quot;Frankfurt/Main&quot; or &quot;Frankfurt/M&quot;. The common abbreviation for the name of the city is &quot;FFM&quot;. Also in use is &quot;FRA&quot;, the IATA code for Frankfurt Airport.

==History==

===Early history and Holy Roman Empire===
At the western borders of Frankfurt lies the Kapellenberg as part of the Taunus with one of the first Stone Age cities in Europe. The Celts had different settlements in the Taunus mountains north of Frankfurt, the biggest one the Heidetrank Oppidum. The first traces of Roman settlements established in the area of the river Nidda date to the reign of Emperor Vespasian in the years 69 to 79 AD. Nida (modern Heddernheim, Praunheim) was a Roman civitas capital (&quot;Civitas Taunensium&quot;).

Alemanni and Franks lived there, and by 794, Charlemagne presided over an imperial assembly and church synod, at which &quot;Franconofurd&quot; (alternative spellings end with -furt and -) was first mentioned. It was one of the two capitals of Charlemagne&#x27;s grandson Louis the German, together with Regensburg. Louis founded the collegiate church, rededicated in 1239 to Bartholomew the Apostle and now Frankfurt Cathedral.

Frankfurt was one of the most important cities in the Holy Roman Empire. From 855, the German kings were elected and crowned in Aachen. From 1562, the kings and emperors were crowned and elected in Frankfurt, initiated for Maximilian II. This tradition ended in 1792, when Francis II was elected. His coronation was deliberately held on Bastille Day, 14 July, the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. The elections and coronations took place in St. Bartholomäus Cathedral, known as the (Emperor&#x27;s Cathedral), or its predecessors.

The (&#x27;Frankfurt Trade Fair&#x27;) was first mentioned in 1150. In 1240, Emperor Frederick II granted an imperial privilege to its visitors, meaning they would be protected by the empire. The fair became particularly important when similar fairs in French Beaucaire lost attraction around 1380. Book trade fairs began in 1478.

In 1372, Frankfurt became a (Imperial Free City), i.e., directly subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.

In 1585, Frankfurt traders established a system of exchange rates for the various currencies that were circulating to prevent cheating and extortion. Therein lay the early roots for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

Frankfurt managed to remain neutral during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, but suffered from the bubonic plague that refugees brought to the city. After the war, Frankfurt regained its wealth. In the late 1770s the theater principal Abel Seyler was based in Frankfurt, and established the city&#x27;s theatrical life.
===Impact of French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars===
Following the French Revolution, Frankfurt was occupied or bombarded several times by French troops. It remained a Free city until the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1805/6. In 1806, it became part of the principality of Aschaffenburg under the (Prince-Primate), Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg. This meant that Frankfurt was incorporated into the Confederation of the Rhine. In 1810, Dalberg adopted the title of a Grand Duke of Frankfurt. Napoleon intended to make his adopted son Eugène de Beauharnais, already (&quot;prince of Venice&quot;, a newly established primogeniture in Italy), Grand Duke of Frankfurt after Dalberg&#x27;s death (since the latter as a Catholic bishop had no legitimate heirs). The Grand Duchy remained a short episode lasting from 1810 to 1813 when the military tide turned in favor of the Anglo-Prussian-led allies that overturned the Napoleonic order. Dalberg abdicated in favor of Eugène de Beauharnais, which of course was only a symbolic action, as the latter effectively never ruled after the ruin of the French armies and Frankfurt&#x27;s takeover by the allies.

===Frankfurt as a fully sovereign state===
After Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat and abdication, the Congress of Vienna (1814–1815) dissolved the grand-duchy and Frankfurt became a fully sovereign city-state with a republican form of government. Frankfurt entered the newly founded German Confederation (till 1866) as a free city, becoming the seat of its , the confederal parliament where the nominally presiding Habsburg Emperor of Austria was represented by an Austrian &quot;presidential envoy&quot;.

After the ill-fated revolution of 1848, Frankfurt was the seat of the first democratically elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament, which met in the (St. Paul&#x27;s Church) and was opened on 18 May 1848. In the year of its existence, the assembly developed a common constitution for a unified Germany, with the Prussian king as its monarch. The institution failed in 1849 when the Prussian king, Frederick William IV, declared that he would not accept &quot;a crown from the gutter&quot;.

===Frankfurt after the loss of sovereignty===

Frankfurt lost its independence after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 when Prussia annexed several smaller states, among them the Free City of Frankfurt. The Prussian administration incorporated Frankfurt into its province of Hesse-Nassau. The Prussian occupation and annexation were perceived as a great injustice in Frankfurt, which retained its distinct western European, urban and cosmopolitan character. The formerly independent towns of Bornheim and Bockenheim were incorporated in 1890.

In 1914, the citizens founded the University of Frankfurt, later named Goethe University Frankfurt. This marked the only civic foundation of a university in Germany; today it is one of Germany&#x27;s largest.

From 6 April to 17 May 1920, following military intervention to put down the Ruhr uprising, Frankfurt was occupied by French troops. The French claimed that Articles 42 to 44 of the peace treaty of Versailles concerning the demilitarization of the Rhineland had been broken. In 1924, Ludwig Landmann became the first Jewish mayor of the city, and led a significant expansion during the following years. During the Nazi era, the synagogues of the city were destroyed and the vast majority of the Jewish population fled or was killed.

During World War II, Frankfurt was the location of a Nazi prison for underage girls with several forced labour camps, a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see &quot;Romani Holocaust&quot;), the Dulag Luft West transit camp for Allied prisoners of war, and a subcamp of the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp.

Frankfurt was severely bombed in World War II (1939–1945). About 5,500 residents were killed during the raids, and the once-famous medieval city center, by that time one of the largest in Germany, was almost completely destroyed. It became a ground battlefield on 26 March 1945, when the Allied advance into Germany was forced to take the city in contested urban combat that included a river assault. The 5th Infantry Division and the 6th Armored Division of the United States Army captured Frankfurt after several days of intense fighting, and it was declared largely secure on 29 March 1945. Frankfurt consists to over 40% of buildings from before World War II, besides all destruction.

After the end of the war, Frankfurt became a part of the newly founded state of Hesse, consisting of the old Hesse-(Darmstadt) and the Prussian Hesse provinces. The city was part of the American Zone of Occupation of Germany. The Military Governor for the United States Zone (1945–1949) and the United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) (1949–1952) had their headquarters in the IG Farben Building, intentionally left undamaged by the Allies&#x27; wartime bombardment.

Frankfurt was the original choice for the provisional capital city of the newly founded state of West Germany in 1949. The city constructed a parliament building that was never used for its intended purpose (it housed the radio studios of Hessischer Rundfunk). In the end, Konrad Adenauer, the first postwar Chancellor, preferred the town of Bonn, for the most part because it was close to his hometown, but also because many other prominent politicians opposed the choice of Frankfurt out of concern that Frankfurt would be accepted as the permanent capital, thereby weakening the West German population&#x27;s support for a reunification with East Germany and the eventual return of the capital to Berlin.

Postwar reconstruction took place in a sometimes simple modern style, thus changing Frankfurt&#x27;s architectural face. A few landmark buildings were reconstructed historically, albeit in a simplified manner (e.g., Römer, St. Paul&#x27;s Church, and Goethe House). The collection of historically significant Cairo Genizah documents of the Municipal Library was destroyed by the bombing. According to Arabist and Genizah scholar S.D. Goitein, &quot;not even handlists indicating its contents have survived.&quot;
The end of the war marked Frankfurt&#x27;s comeback as Germany&#x27;s leading financial hub, mainly because Berlin, now a city divided into four sectors, could no longer rival it. In 1948, the Allies founded the Bank deutscher Länder, the forerunner of . Following this decision, more financial institutions were re-established, e.g. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. In the 1950s, Frankfurt Stock Exchange regained its position as the country&#x27;s leading stock exchange.

Frankfurt also reemerged as Germany&#x27;s transportation hub and Frankfurt Airport became Europe&#x27;s second-busiest airport behind London Heathrow Airport in 1961.

During the 1970s, the city created one of Europe&#x27;s most efficient underground transportation systems. That system includes a suburban rail system (S-Bahn) linking outlying communities with the city center, and a deep underground light rail system with smaller coaches (U-Bahn) also capable of travelling above ground on rails.

In 1998, the European Central Bank was founded in Frankfurt, followed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and European Systemic Risk Board in 2011.

==Geography==

Frankfurt is the largest city in the state of Hesse in the western part of Germany.

===Site===
Frankfurt is located on both sides of the river Main, south-east of the Taunus mountain range. The southern part of the city contains the Frankfurt City Forest, Germany&#x27;s largest city forest. The city area is and extends over east to west and north to south. Its downtown is north of the river Main in Altstadt district (the historical center) and the surrounding Innenstadt district. The geographical center is in Bockenheim district near Frankfurt West station.

Frankfurt at the heart of the densely populated Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region with a population of 5.5 million. Other important cities in the region are Wiesbaden (capital of Hesse), Mainz (capital of Rhineland-Palatinate), Darmstadt, Offenbach am Main, Hanau, Aschaffenburg, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Rüsselsheim, Wetzlar and Marburg.

===Districts===

The city is divided into 46 city districts (&quot;Stadtteile&quot;), which are in turn divided into 121 city boroughs (&quot;Stadtbezirke&quot;) and 448 electoral districts (&quot;Wahlbezirke&quot;). The 46 city districts combine into 16 area districts (&quot;Ortsbezirke&quot;), which each have a district committee and chairperson.

The largest city district by population and area is Sachsenhausen, while the smallest is Altstadt, Frankfurt&#x27;s historical center. Three larger city districts (Sachsenhausen, Westend and Nordend) are divided for administrative purposes into a northern (&quot;-Nord&quot;) and a southern (&quot;-Süd&quot;) part, respectively a western (&quot;-West&quot;) and an eastern (&quot;-Ost&quot;) part, but are generally considered as one city district (which is why often only 43 city districts are mentioned, even on the city&#x27;s official website).

Some larger housing areas are often falsely called city districts, even by locals, like Nordweststadt (part of Niederursel, Heddernheim and Praunheim), Goldstein (part of Schwanheim), Riedberg (part of Kalbach-Riedberg) and Europaviertel (part of Gallus). The Bankenviertel (&quot;banking district&quot;), Frankfurt&#x27;s financial district, is also not an administrative city district (it covers parts of the western Innenstadt district, the southern Westend district and the eastern Bahnhofsviertel district).

Many city districts are incorporated suburbs (&quot;Vororte&quot;) or were previously independent cities, such as Höchst. Some like Nordend and Westend arose during the rapid growth of the city in the Gründerzeit following the Unification of Germany, while others were formed from territory which previously belonged to other city , such as Dornbusch and Riederwald.

===History of incorporations===
Until the year 1877 the city&#x27;s territory consisted of the present-day inner-city districts of Altstadt, Innenstadt, Bahnhofsviertel, Gutleutviertel, Gallus, Westend, Nordend, Ostend and Sachsenhausen.

Bornheim was part of an administrative district called &quot;Landkreis Frankfurt&quot;, before becoming part of the city on 1 January 1877, followed by Bockenheim on 1 April 1895. Seckbach, Niederrad and Oberrad followed on 1 July 1900. The &quot;Landkreis Frankfurt&quot; was finally dispersed on 1 April 1910, and therefore Berkersheim, Bonames, Eckenheim, Eschersheim, Ginnheim, Hausen, Heddernheim, Niederursel, Praunheim, Preungesheim and Rödelheim joined the city. In the same year a new city district, Riederwald, was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Seckbach and Ostend.

On 1 April 1928 the City of Höchst became part of Frankfurt, as well as its city districts Sindlingen, Unterliederbach and Zeilsheim. Simultaneously the &quot;Landkreis Höchst&quot; was dispersed with its member cities either joining Frankfurt (Fechenheim, Griesheim, Nied, Schwanheim, Sossenheim) or joining the newly established &quot;Landkreis&quot; of Main-Taunus-Kreis.

Dornbusch became a city district in 1946. It was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Eckenheim and Ginnheim.

On 1 August 1972, Hesse&#x27;s smaller suburbs of Harheim, Kalbach, Nieder-Erlenbach, and Nieder-Eschbach became districts while other neighboring suburbs chose to join the Main-Taunus-Kreis, the Landkreis Offenbach, the Kreis Groß-Gerau, the Hochtaunuskreis, the Main-Kinzig-Kreis or the Wetteraukreis.

Bergen-Enkheim was the last suburb to become part of Frankfurt on 1 January 1977.

Flughafen became an official city district in 1979. It covers the area of Frankfurt Airport that had belonged to Sachsenhausen and the neighboring city of Mörfelden-Walldorf.

Frankfurt&#x27;s youngest city district is Frankfurter Berg. It was part of Bonames until 1996.

Kalbach was officially renamed Kalbach-Riedberg in 2006 because of the large residential housing development in the area known as Riedberg.

===Neighboring districts and cities===
To the west Frankfurt borders the administrative district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) of Main-Taunus-Kreis with towns such as Hattersheim am Main, Kriftel, Hofheim am Taunus, Kelkheim, Liederbach am Taunus, Sulzbach, Schwalbach am Taunus and Eschborn; to the northwest the Hochtaunuskreis with Steinbach, Oberursel (Taunus) and Bad Homburg vor der Höhe; to the north the Wetteraukreis with Karben and Bad Vilbel; to the northeast the Main-Kinzig-Kreis with Niederdorfelden and Maintal; to the southeast the city of Offenbach am Main; to the south the Kreis Offenbach with Neu-Isenburg and to the southwest the Kreis Groß-Gerau with Mörfelden-Walldorf, Rüsselsheim and Kelsterbach.

Together with these towns (and some larger nearby towns, e.g., Hanau, Rodgau, Dreieich, Langen) Frankfurt forms a contiguous built-up urban area called &quot;Stadtregion Frankfurt&quot; which is not an official administrative district. The urban area had an estimated population of 2.3 million in 2010, and is the 13th-largest urban area in the EU.

===Climate===
Frankfurt has a temperate-oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Its climate features cool winters with frequent rain showers and overcast skies, and warm to hot summers. The average annual temperature is , with monthly mean temperatures ranging from in January to in July. The descriptions below are based on climate data between 1991 and 2020 , can be seen as transitional to the light influences with the temperate humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) found in outdoor areas.

Due to its location at the northern tip of the Upper Rhine Valley in the Southwest of Germany, Frankfurt is one of the warmest and driest major German cities along with Darmstadt, Mannheim, Karlsruhe and Freiburg im Breisgau. Summers in Frankfurt can get quite hot when compared to the rest of the country. On average, it sees 62 days with a daily high temperature above 25 °C and 18 days with a high above 30 °C per year.

Climate change is elevating the number of hot days. In the year of 2018, Frankfurt recorded 108 days with a maximum over 25 °C and 43 days with a high above 30 °C. This is compared to 52 and 13 days on average per year between 1981 and 2010. The overall tendency for higher temperatures can also be seen when comparing the climate data from 1981 to 2010 with the data from 2010 to 2020. Being an urban heat island, Frankfurt sometimes experiences tropical nights, where the temperature does not fall below 20 °C between May and September. This is exacerbated and made more frequent as the density of the city stores daytime heat overnight.

The growing season is longer when compared to the rest of Germany, thus resulting in an early arrival of springtime in the region, with trees typically leafing out already toward the end of March.

Winters in Frankfurt are generally mild or at least not freezing with a small possibility of snow, especially in January and February but dark and often overcast. Frankfurt is, on average, covered with snow only for around 10 to 20 days per year. The temperature falls below 0 °C on about 64 days and the daily maximum stays below freezing for about 10 days on average per year. Some days with lows under −10 °C can occur more often here than at the coasts of Northern Germany, but not as frequently as in Bavaria or the eastern parts of Germany.

Because of the mild climate in the region, there are some well-known wine regions in the vicinity such as Rhenish Hesse, Rheingau, Franconia (wine region) and Bergstraße (route). There is also a microclimate on the northern bank of the river Main which allows palms, fig trees, lemon trees and southern European plants to grow in that area. The area is called the &quot;Nizza&quot; (the German word for the southern French town Nice) and is one of the biggest parks with Mediterranean vegetation north of the Alps.


==Demographics==

===Population===

With a population of 763,380 (2019) within its administrative boundaries and of 2,300,000 in the actual urban area, Frankfurt is the fifth-largest city in Germany, after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne. Central Frankfurt has been a &quot;Großstadt&quot; (a city with at least 100,000 residents by definition) since 1875. With 414,576 residents in 1910, it was the ninth largest city in Germany and the number of inhabitants grew to 553,464 before World War II. After the war, at the end of the year 1945, the number had dropped to 358,000. In the following years, the population grew again and reached an all-time-high of 691,257 in 1963. It dropped again to 592,411 in 1986 but has increased since then. According to the demographic forecasts for central Frankfurt, the city will have a population up to 813,000 within its administrative boundaries in 2035 and more than 2.5 million inhabitants in its urban area.

As of 2015, Frankfurt had 1909 ultra high-net-worth individuals, the sixth-highest number of any city in the world. It is also the world&#x27;s 14th-richest city by total wealth, as of 2017.

During the 1970s, the state government of Hesse wanted to expand the city&#x27;s administrative boundaries to include the entire urban area. This would have made Frankfurt officially the second-largest city in Germany after Berlin with up to 3 million inhabitants. However, because local authorities did not agree, the administrative territory is still much smaller than its actual urban area.

===Moroccan community===
Frankfurt has the largest Moroccan community in Germany, numbering about 8,000 people, and the Rhine-Main area has about 20,000. Many Moroccans came as guest workers in the 1970s. Today Frankfurt has many Moroccan restaurants, companies, shops, mosques and hamams. Due to the popularity of Moroccan culture in Frankfurt, it also led many people from the Maghreb and other African countries to move to Frankfurt. Famous singer Namika was born in Frankfurt to Moroccan parents.

===Immigration and foreign nationals===
According to data from the city register of residents, 51.2% of the population had a &quot;migration background&quot; as of 2015, which means that a person or at least one of their parents was born with foreign citizenship. For the first time, a majority of the city residents had an at least part non-German background. Moreover, three of four children in the city under the age of six had full or partial immigrant backgrounds, and 27.7% of residents had a foreign citizenship.

According to statistics, 46.7% of immigrants in Frankfurt come from other countries in the EU; 24.5% come from European countries that are not part of the EU; 15.7% come from Asia (including Western Asia and South Asia); 7.3% come from Africa; 3.4% come from North America (including the Caribbean and Central America); 0.2% come from Australia and New ZealandNew Zealand; 2.3% come from South America; and 1.1% come from Pacific island nations. Because of this the city is often considered to be a multicultural city, and has been compared to New York City and London.

===Religion===
Frankfurt was historically a Protestant-dominated city. However, during the 19th century, an increasing number of Catholics moved to Frankfurt. , the largest Christian denominations were Catholicism (22.7% of the population) and Protestantism, especially Lutheranism (19.4%).
The Jewish community has a history dating back to medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Germany. Over 7,200 inhabitants are affiliated with the Jewish community, making it the second largest in Germany after Berlin. Frankfurt has four active synagogues.

Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s, Frankfurt has a large Muslim community, estimated at 12% in 2006. 
According to calculations based on census data for 21 countries of origin, the number of Muslim migrants in Frankfurt amounted to about 84,000 in 2011, making up 12.6% of the population. The most prevalent countries of origin were Turkey and Morocco. The Ahmadiyya Noor Mosque, constructed in 1959, is the city&#x27;s largest mosque and the third largest in Germany. In 2020, the number of Muslims in Frankfurt&#x27;s total population was estimated at 18%.

=== Landtag election ===
For elections to the Hesse State Parliament, Frankfurt am Main is split up into six constituencies. In total 15 delegates represent the city in the Landtag in Wiesbaden. The last election took place in October 2018. Six members of parliament were directly elected in their respective constituencies: Uwe Serke (CDU, Frankfurt am Main I), Miriam Dahlke (Greens, Frankfurt am Main II), Ralf-Norbert Bartel (CDU, Frankfurt am Main III), Michael Boddenberg (CDU, Frankfurt am Main IV), Markus Bocklet (Greens, Frankfurt am Main V) and Boris Rhein (CDU, Frankfurt am Main VI).

Delegates from Frankfurt often serve high-ranking positions in Hessian politics, e.g. Michael Boddenberg is Hessian Minister of Finance and Boris Rhein was elected President of the Landtag of Hesse in 2019.

=== German federal election ===
For federal elections which are held every four years, Frankfurt is split up into two constituencies. In the German federal election 2017, Matthias Zimmer (CDU) and Bettina Wiesmann were elected to the Bundestag by directe mandate in Frankfurt am Main I and Frankfurt am Main II respectively. Nicola Beer (FDP), Achim Kessler (Linke), Ulli Nissen (SPD) and Omid Nouripour (Greens) were elected as well.

Nicola Beer resigned as a member of parliament in 2019 following her election to the European Parliament where she now serves as vice president.

==Economy and business==
Frankfurt is one of the world&#x27;s most important financial hubs and Germany&#x27;s financial capital, followed by Hamburg and Stuttgart. Frankfurt was ranked eighth at the International Financial Centers Development Index (2013), eighth at the Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index (2008), ninth at the Global Financial Centres Index (September 2013), tenth at the Global Power City Index (2011), 11th at the Global City Competitiveness Index (2012), 12th at the Innovation Cities Index (2011), 14th at the World City Survey (2011) and 23rd at the Global Cities Index (2012).

The city&#x27;s importance as a financial hub has risen since the eurozone crisis. Indications are the establishment of two institutions of the European System of Financial Supervisors (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and European Systemic Risk Board) in 2011, and the entry into force in 2014 of European Banking Supervision, by which the European Central Bank has become the central supervisory authority for the euro area banking sector.

According to an annual study by Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the European Cities Monitor (2010), Frankfurt has been one of the top three cities for international companies in Europe, after London and Paris, since the survey started in 1990. It is the only German city considered to be an alpha world city (category 3) as listed by the Loughborough University group&#x27;s 2010 inventory, which was a promotion from the group&#x27;s 2008 inventory when it was ranked as an alpha minus world city (category 4).

With over 922 jobs per 1,000 inhabitants, Frankfurt has the highest concentration of jobs in Germany. On work days and Saturdays, one million people commute from all over the Rhein-Main-Area. The GRP per capita was €96,670 in 2019.

The city is expected to benefit from international banks relocating jobs from London to Frankfurt as a result of Brexit to retain access to the EU market. Thus far, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc., Standard Chartered Plc and Nomura Holdings Inc. announced they would move their EU headquarters to Frankfurt.

===Central banks===

Frankfurt is home to two important central banks: the German Bundesbank and the European Central Bank (ECB).

====European Central Bank====

The European Central Bank (&quot;Europäische Zentralbank&quot;) is one of the world&#x27;s most important central banks with a balance sheet total of around 7 trillion. The ECB sets monetary policy for the Eurozone, consisting of 19 EU member states that have adopted the Euro (€) as their common currency. From 1998 the ECB Headquarters have been located in Frankfurt, first in the Eurotower at Willy-Brandt-Platz and in two other nearby high-rises. The new Seat of the European Central Bank in the Ostend district, consisting of the former wholesale market hall (&quot;Großmarkthalle&quot;) and a newly built 185-meter skyscraper, was completed in late 2014. The new building complex was designed to accommodate up to 2,300 ECB personnel. The location is a few kilometers away from downtown and borders an industrial area as well as the Osthafen (&quot;East Harbor&quot;), It was primarily chosen because of its large premises which allows the ECB to install security arrangements without high fences.

The city honors the importance of the ECB by officially using the slogan &quot;The City of the Euro&quot; since 1998.

====Deutsche Bundesbank====
The (German Federal Bank), located in Ginnheim, was established in 1957 as the central bank for the Federal Republic of Germany. Until the euro (€) was introduced in 1999, the Deutsche Bundesbank was responsible for the monetary policy of Germany and for the German currency, the Deutsche Mark (DM). The Bundesbank was greatly respected for its control of inflation through the second half of the 20th century. Today the Bundesbank is an integral part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) which is formed by all 27 EU member states. Its bilance sheet total is around 2,7 trillion, making it the 4th biggest central bank.

===Frankfurt Stock Exchange===
The Frankfurt Stock Exchange (&quot;Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse&quot;) began in the ninth century. By the 16th century Frankfurt had developed into an important European hub for trade fairs and financial services. Today the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is by far the largest in Germany, with a turnover of more than 90 percent of the German stock market and is the third-largest in Europe after the London Stock Exchange and the European branch of the NYSE Euronext.

Trading takes place exclusively via the Xetra trading system, with redundant floor brokers taking on the role of market-makers on the new platform.

On 1 February 2012 European Commission blocked the proposed merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext. &quot;The merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide. These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive. We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns.&quot; European competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia said.

It is located downtown at the Börsenplatz. Deutsche Börse&#x27;s headquarters are formally registered in Frankfurt, but it moved most of its employees to a high-rise called &quot;The Cube&quot; in Eschborn in 2010, primarily due to significantly lower local corporate taxes.

==Cityscape==

===Landmarks===
Römer

Römer, the German word for Roman, is a complex of nine houses that form the Frankfurt city hall (&quot;Rathaus&quot;). The houses were acquired by the city council in 1405 from a wealthy merchant family. The middle house became the city hall and was later connected with its neighbors. The &quot;Kaisersaal&quot; (&quot;Emperor&#x27;s Hall&quot;) is located on the upper floor and is where the newly crowned emperors held their banquets. The Römer was partially destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. The surrounding square, the Römerberg, is named after the city hall.
The former Altstadt (old town) quarter between the Römer and the Frankfurt Cathedral was redeveloped as the Dom-Römer Quarter from 2012 to 2018, including 15 reconstructions of historical buildings that were destroyed during World War II.

Frankfurt Cathedral

Frankfurt Cathedral (Frankfurter Dom) is not a cathedral, but the main Catholic church, dedicated to St. Bartholomew. The Gothic building was constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries on the foundation of an earlier church from the Merovingian time. From 1356 onwards, kings of the Holy Roman Empire were elected in this church, and from 1562 to 1792, Roman-German emperors were crowned there.

Since the 18th century, St. Bartholomew&#x27;s has been called &quot;Dom&quot;, although it was never a bishop&#x27;s seat. In 1867 it was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in its present style. It was again partially destroyed in World War II and rebuilt in the 1950s. Its height is 95 meters. The cathedral tower has a viewing platform open to the public at a height of 66 meters, accessed through a narrow spiral staircase with 386 steps.
St. Paul&#x27;s Church

St. Paul&#x27;s Church (&quot;Paulskirche&quot;) is a national historic monument in Germany because it was the seat of the first democratically elected parliament in 1848. It was established in 1789 as a Protestant church, but was not completed until 1833. Its importance has its roots in the Frankfurt Parliament, which met in the church during the revolutionary years of 1848/49 in order to write a constitution for a united Germany. The attempt failed because the monarchs of Prussia and Austria did not want to lose power. In 1849, Prussian troops ended the democratic experiment by force and the parliament dissolved; the building was once more used for religious services.

St. Paul&#x27;s was partially destroyed in World War II with its interior significantly damaged. It was quickly and symbolically rebuilt after the war albeit with modern alterations particularly to the interior; today it is used mainly for exhibitions and events.

Archäologischer Garten Frankfurt

The Archaeological Garden contains small parts of the oldest recovered buildings: an ancient Roman settlement and the Frankfurt Royal Palace (&quot;Kaiserpfalz Frankfurt&quot;) from the sixth century. The garden is located between the Römerberg and the cathedral. It was discovered after World War II when the area was heavily bombed and later partly rebuilt. The remains were preserved and are now open to the public. From 2013 until 2015 an event building, the Stadthaus (&quot;City house&quot;), has been built on top of the garden, but it remains open to the public free of charge.

Haus Wertheim

Wertheim House is the only timbered house in the Altstadt district that survived the heavy bombings of World War II undamaged. It is located on the Römerberg next to the Historical Museum.

Saalhof

The Saalhof is the oldest conserved building in the Altstadt district and dates to the 12th century. It was used as an exhibition hall by Dutch clothiers when trade fairs were held during the 14th and 15th centuries. The Saalhof was partly destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. Today it serves as a part of the Historical Museum.

Eiserner Steg

The Eiserner Steg (Iron Bridge) is a pedestrian-only bridge across the Main that connects Römerberg and Sachsenhausen. It was built in 1868 and was the second bridge to cross the river. After World War II, when it was blown up by the Wehrmacht, it was quickly rebuilt in 1946. Today some 10,000 people cross the bridge on a daily basis.

Alte Oper

The Alte Oper is a former opera house, hence the name &quot;Old Opera&quot;. The opera house was built in 1880 by architect Richard Lucae. It was one of the major opera houses in Germany until it was heavily damaged in World War II. Until the late 1970s, it was a ruin, nicknamed &quot;Germany&#x27;s most beautiful ruin&quot;. Former Frankfurt Lord Mayor Rudi Arndt called for blowing it up in the 1960s, which earned him the nickname &quot;Dynamite-Rudi&quot;. (Later on, Arndt said he never had meant his suggestion seriously.)

Public pressure led to its refurbishment and reopening in 1981. Today, it functions as a famous concert hall, while operas are performed at the &quot;new&quot; Frankfurt Opera. The inscription on the frieze of the Alte Oper says: &quot;Dem Wahren, Schönen, Guten&quot; (&quot;To the true, the beautiful, the good&quot;).

Eschenheimer Turm

The Eschenheim Tower (&quot;Eschenheimer Turm&quot;) was erected at the beginning of the 15th century and served as a city gate as part of late-medieval fortifications. It is the oldest and most unaltered building in the Innenstadt district.

St. Catherine&#x27;s Church

St. Catherine&#x27;s Church (&quot;Katharinenkirche&quot;) is the largest Protestant church, dedicated to Catherine of Alexandria, a martyred early Christian saint. It is located downtown at the entrance to the Zeil, the central pedestrian shopping street.

Hauptwache

Although today Hauptwache is mostly associated with the inner-city underground train station of the same name, the name originates from a baroque building on the square above the station. The Hauptwache building was constructed in 1730 and was used as a prison, therefore the name that translates as &quot;main guard-house&quot;. Today the square surrounding the building is also called &quot;Hauptwache&quot; (formal: &quot;An der Hauptwache&quot;). It is situated downtown opposite to St. Catherine&#x27;s Church and houses a famous café.
Central Station

Frankfurt Central Station (&quot;Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof&quot;), which opened in 1888, was built as the central train station for Frankfurt to replace three smaller downtown train stations and to boost the needed capacity for travellers. It was constructed as a terminus station and was the largest train station in Europe by floor area until 1915 when Leipzig Central Station was opened. Its three main halls were constructed in a neorenaissance-style, while the later enlargement with two outer halls in 1924 was constructed in neoclassic-style.

Frankfurter Hof

The Frankfurter Hof is a landmark downtown hotel at Kaiserplatz, built from 1872 to 1876. It is part of Steigenberger Hotels group and is considered the city&#x27;s most prestigious.

St. Leonhard

St. Leonhard, on the Main close to the bridge Eiserner Steg, is a Catholic late Gothic hall church, derived from a Romanesque style basilica beginning in 1425. It is the only one of nine churches in the Old Town that survived World War II almost undamaged. The parish serves the English-speaking community. The church has been under restoration from 2011 until 2019.

Gründerzeit quarters

Around the city centre there are wide spread quarters full of Gründerzeit architecture. Buildings of that typ often sport richly-decorated façades in the form of Historicism such as Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, German Renaissance and Baroque Revival.

Timber framed old towns

Around the city center of Frankfurt are several former independent villages, now part of the city, with timber framed centres and even whole old towns like Höchst, Seckbach, Niederursel and Bergen-Enkheim. Overall there are around 14.500 buildings in Frankfurt built before 1919 and around 3.000 of them are timber framed houses.

Upon its completion, the complex was the largest office building in Europe and remained so until the 1950s. The building served as headquarters for research projects relating to the development of synthetic oil and rubber and the manufacturing of magnesium, lubricating oil, explosives, methanol, and Zyklon B, the lethal gas used in concentration camps. After World War II, it served as the headquarters for the Supreme Allied Command and from 1949 to 1952 the High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG). It became the principal location for implementing the Marshall Plan, which largely financed the post-war reconstruction of Europe. The state apparatus of the Federal German Government was devised there. It served as the headquarters for the US Army&#x27;s V Corps and the Northern Area Command (NACOM) until 1995 when the US Army returned control of the IG Farben Building to the German government. It was purchased on behalf of the Goethe University Frankfurt by the state of Hesse. In October 2001 it became part of the Westend Campus of Goethe University.

===History of high-rise buildings===
For centuries, St. Bartholomeus&#x27;s Cathedral was the tallest structure. The first building to exceed the 95-meter-high cathedral was not an office building but a grain silo, the Henninger Turm, built from 1959 to 1961.

The first high-rise building boom came in the 1970s when Westend Gate (then called &quot;Plaza Büro Center&quot;) and Silberturm were constructed and became the tallest buildings in Germany with a height of 159.3 meters and 166.3 meters, respectively. Around the same time, Frankfurter Büro Center and City-Haus (142.4 meters and 142.1 meters) were constructed at Mainzer Landstraße and Eurotower (148.0 meters) and Garden Tower (127.0 meters; then called &quot;Helaba-Hochhaus&quot;) were constructed in the financial district.

None of the buildings constructed during the 1980s surpassed Silberturm. The most famous buildings from this decade are the Deutsche Bank Twin Towers at Taunusanlage, both 155.0 meters tall.

The 1990s featured a second wave. Messeturm, built on the trade fair site, reached a height of and became the tallest building in Europe by 1991. It was overtaken by the Commerzbank Tower in 1997. Other tall buildings from this decade are Westendstrasse 1 (), Main Tower () and Trianon ().

In 21st-century Frankfurt, more high-rise buildings and skyscrapers (e.g., Skyper, Opernturm, Tower 185, Seat of the European Central Bank, Taunusturm) emerged, but none have surpassed Commerzbank Tower.

===Other tall structures===

*Europaturm — The Europe Tower is a telecommunications tower, also known as the Frankfurt TV Tower, built from 1974 to 1979. With a height of 337.5 meters it is the tallest tower and the second tallest structure in Germany after the Fernsehturm Berlin. It was open to the public until 1999, with an entertainment establishment in the revolving top. It is normally referred to by locals as the &quot;Ginnheimer Spargel&quot; (&quot;Ginnheim Asparagus&quot;), but stands a few meters within Bockenheim district.
*Henninger Turm — The Henninger Tower was a 120-mete-high grain silo built from 1959 to 1961 and owned by Henninger Brewery. It was the highest structure until 1974. The Henninger Tower had two rotating restaurants at the height of 101 and 106 meters and an open-air observation deck at the height of 110 meters. The tower closed to the public in October 2002 and was demolished in 2013 to be replaced by a 140 m (459 ft) tall residential tower, which is externally inspired by the old Henninger Turm. The cornerstone for this project was laid in June 2014 and construction was completed in summer 2017. The new tower offers 207 luxury flats and houses the non-rotating restaurant &quot;Franziska&quot;. From 1962 to 2008 a famous yearly cycling race was named after the tower, the &quot;Radrennen Rund um den Henninger Turm&quot; (&quot;Cycling race around Henninger Tower&quot;). The now-renamed race is still a yearly event.
*Goetheturm – The Goethe Tower was a tower on the northern edge of the Frankfurt City Forest in Sachsenhausen. It was the fifth tallest wood construction structure in Germany. It was built in 1931 and was a popular place for day-trippers until it burned down in 2017. A faithful reconstruction has been opened to the public on 12 October 2020, exactly three years after the original&#x27;s destruction.

===Shopping streets===

*Zeil – Frankfurt&#x27;s central shopping street. It is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by two large public squares, Hauptwache in the west and Konstablerwache in the east. It is the second most expensive street for shops to rent in Germany after the Kaufingerstraße in Munich. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as H&amp;M, Saturn, Esprit, Zara or NewYorker. In 2009 a new shopping mall named MyZeil opened there with nearly 100 stores and chains like Hollister. Three more shopping malls occupy the Zeil: UpperZeil (replacing the Zeilgalerie, which was demolished in 2016), Galeria Kaufhof and Karstadt, as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from Peek &amp; Cloppenburg and C&amp;A. During the month before Christmas, the extended pedestrian-only zone is host to Frankfurt Christmas Market, one of the largest and oldest Christmas markets in Germany.
*Goethestraße – Frankfurt&#x27;s most expensive shopping street with prestigious shops like Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci, Tiffany, Giorgio Armani, Versace, Cartier, Burberry, Vertu and Bulgari. It is located between the financial district and downtown, running from Goetheplatz to Opernplatz.
*Freßgass – (officially &quot;Kalbächer Gasse&quot; and &quot;Große Bockenheimer Straße&quot;) is a central pedestrian-only street section between Börsenstraße and Opernplatz. The name translates as &quot;feeding alley&quot; because of its high concentration of gastronomy, but lately prestigious shops (e.g., Apple Store, Hugo Boss, Porsche Design) have moved here due to the lack of space in the neighboring Goethestraße, displacing old, established restaurants, butchers and delicatessens.
*Berger Straße – Frankfurt&#x27;s longest shopping street. It starts in the city center, runs through Nordend and Bornheim and ends in Seckbach. The street is less crowded than the Zeil and offers a greater variety of smaller shops, restaurants and cafés.
*Leipziger Straße – Central shopping street in the Bockenheim district starting at Bockenheimer Warte going towards West. High density of shops for daily needs. 
*Braubachstraße – In the Altstadt district, close to the historic sites of the city, offers a large variety of art galleries, second-hand bookshops and antique shops.

*Kaiserstraße – One of the best-known streets and considered one of the most beautiful because of its amount of Gründerzeit-style buildings. It runs parallel to Münchener Straße from the central station to the financial district.

Today Kaiserstraße houses many small shops, restaurants and cafés.
*Kleinmarkthalle – (literally: &quot;Small Market Hall&quot;) is a market hall close to Konstablerwache square offering fresh food and flowers. In addition to regional delicacies like green sauce imported goods are offered. The Kleinmarkthalle is the largest public marketplace in Frankfurt.

It includes the Frankfurter Stadtwald (&quot;Frankfurt City Forest&quot;, Germany&#x27;s largest forest within a city), the Schwanheimer Düne (&quot;Schwanheim Dune&quot;), the Niddatal (&quot;Nidda Valley&quot;), the Niddapark, the Lohrberg (&quot;Lohr Mountain&quot;, Frankfurt&#x27;s only vineyard), the Huthpark, the Enkheimer Ried (&quot;Enkheim Marsh&quot;), the Seckbacher Ried (&quot;Seckbach Marsh&quot;) and the Fechenheimer Mainbogen (a S-shaped part of the Main river in Fechenheim). The Green Belt is a protected area which means that housing is not allowed. The Green Belt was formally created in 1991 with its own constitution.

It is an auto-free zone with large green areas that is popular with strollers and tourists, especially in the summertime, when it can become crowded. The southern riverbank, which continues further to Offenbach am Main and Hanau, offers the best skyline views. The northern riverbank ends in the west at the former Westhafen (&quot;West Harbor&quot;, a residential housing area) and is growing to the east: A former industrial-used area between the new Seat of the European Central Bank and the Osthafen (&quot;East Harbor&quot;) has become a park named Hafenpark (&quot;Harbor Park&quot;), which offers outdoor courts for basketball, soccer and a skatepark.
*Wallanlagen – The Wallanlagen (former &quot;ramparts&quot;) relate to the former ring-shaped city wall fortifications around the Altstadt and the Innenstadt district (abolished 1804–1812), now a series of parks. Building is not allowed, with a few exceptions, the most famous being the Alte Oper (built 1880) at the Opernplatz. The part between the northern Main riverbank and the Opernplatz, referred to officially as Taunusanlage and Gallusanlage, is locally known as &quot;Central Park&quot; (a reference to the famous park in Manhattan), because of the skyscrapers which stand on both sides.
*Nizza Park – At the juncture of the northern Main riverbank and the Wallanlagen is a famous small park called Nizza. The name of the park recalls Nice in southern France, because it is one of the warmest areas with a nearly mediterranean climate. Numerous Mediterranean flora grow there and can survive outside during the winter.
*Garten des Himmlischen Friedens – &quot;Garden of Heavenly Peace&quot;, named after the Tiananmen Gate in Beijing, is a Chinese-styled park in the Nordend district and part of the larger Bethmannpark. It contains Chinese buildings, with building materials imported from China and built by Chinese workers in the 1980s. Hosts traditional Chinese plants and herbs.

===Performing arts===
====Music====
Eurodance and Trance music originated in Frankfurt. In 1989 German producers Michael Münzing and Luca Anzilotti (under the pseudonyms Benito Benites and John &quot;Virgo&quot; Garrett III) formed the Snap! project. Snap! songs combined Rap and Soul vocals adding rhythm by using computer technology and mixing electronic sounds, bass and drums. By doing so a new genre was born: Eurodance. In the early 1990s, DJs including Sven Väth and DJ DAG (of Dance 2 Trance) first played a harder, deeper style of acid house that became popular worldwide over the next decade as Trance music. Some of the early and most influential Eurodance, Trance and Techno acts, e.g., La Bouche, Jam and Spoon, Magic Affair, Culture Beat, Snap!, Dance 2 Trance, Oliver Lieb and Hardfloor, and record labels such as Harthouse and Eye Q, were based in the city in the early 1990s.

It has an alcohol content of 5.5%–7% and a tart, sour taste. It is traditionally served in a glass, typically decorated with lozenges, called &quot;Geripptes&quot;, a full glass is then called &quot;Schoppen&quot;. Apfelwein is also available in a stoneware jar locally known as &quot;Bembel&quot;. A group normally orders a &quot;Bembel&quot; and shares the contents. Apfelwein can be ordered as &quot;sauergespritzer&quot;, which is apfelwein blended with 30% mineral water or as &quot;süssgespritzer&quot;, which is Apfelwein blended with lemon soda, orange soda or fresh-pressed apple juice (lemon soda being the most common). Most of the pubs which serve Apfelwein are located in Sachsenhausen, which is therefore known as &quot;Ebbelwoi district&quot;.

==Quality of life==
In a 2001 ranking by the University of Liverpool, Frankfurt was rated the richest city in Europe by GDP per capita, followed by Karlsruhe, Paris and Munich.

Frankfurt was voted the seventh in the Mercer Quality of Living Survey by the Mercer Quality of Living Survey (2012), seventh in the Mercer Quality of Living Survey (2010) and 18th at the Economist&#x27;s World&#x27;s Most Liveable Cities Survey (2011). According to an annual citizen survey (2010), arranged by the city council, 66 percent inhabitants are satisfied or highly satisfied with the city, while only 6 percent said that they are dissatisfied. Compared to the 1993&#x27;s survey the number of satisfied inhabitants has grown about 22 percent while the number of dissatisfied inhabitants was reduced by 8 percent. 84 percent of the inhabitants like to live in Frankfurt, 13 percent would rather choose to live somewhere else. 37 percent are satisfied with the public safety (1993: only 9 percent), 22 percent are dissatisfied (1993: 64 percent).

Frankfurt consistently has the highest levels of crime per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany (15.976 crimes per annum in 2008) and is therefore dubbed the German &quot;crime capital&quot;. However, this statistic is often criticized because it ignores major factors: It is calculated based on the administrative 680,000-inhabitant figure while the urban area has 2.5 M inhabitants and on weekdays adds another million people (not counting the 53 million passengers passing through the airport each year). The rate for personal safety-relevant crimes such as murder, manslaughter, rape or bodily harm, is 3.4 percent, placing Frankfurt twelfth in the ranking (related to the official 680,000-inhabitant figure) or number 21 (related to the one-million-figure). In 2018, the state of Hesse, where Frankfurt is located, was ranked the third-safest state in Germany.

==Transport==
===Airports===
====Frankfurt Airport====
The city can be accessed from around the world via Frankfurt Airport (&quot;Flughafen Frankfurt am Main&quot;) located southwest of downtown. The airport has four runways and serves 265 nonstop destinations. Run by transport company Fraport it ranks among the world&#x27;s busiest airports by passenger traffic and is the busiest airport by cargo traffic in Europe. The airport also serves as a hub for Condor and as the main hub for German flag carrier Lufthansa. It is the busiest airport in Europe in terms of cargo traffic, and the fourth busiest in Europe in terms of passenger traffic behind London Heathrow Airport, Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Passenger traffic at Frankfurt Airport in 2018 was 69,510,269 passengers.

A third terminal is being constructed (planned to open in 2026). The third terminal will increase the capacity of the airport to over 90 million passengers per year.

The airport can be reached by car or bus and has two railway stations, one for regional and one for long-distance traffic. The S-Bahn lines S8 and S9 (direction &quot;Offenbach Ost&quot; or &quot;Hanau Hbf&quot;) departing at the regional station take 10–15 minutes from the airport to Frankfurt Central Station and onwards to Hauptwache station downtown), the IC and ICE trains departing at the long-distance station take 10 minutes to Frankfurt Central Station.

====Frankfurt Hahn Airport====
Despite the name, Frankfurt Hahn Airport (&quot;Flughafen Frankfurt-Hahn&quot;) is situated approximately from the city in Lautzenhausen (Rhineland-Palatinate). Hahn Airport is a major base for low-cost carrier Ryanair. This airport can only be reached by car or bus. An hourly bus service runs from Frankfurt Central Station, taking just over 2 hours. Passenger traffic at Hahn Airport in 2010 was 3.5 million.

====Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport====
Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport (&quot;Flugplatz Frankfurt-Egelsbach&quot;) is a busy general aviation airport located south-east of Frankfurt Airport, near Egelsbach.

===Roads===

Frankfurt is a traffic hub for the German motorway (&quot;Autobahn&quot;) system. The Frankfurter Kreuz is an Autobahn interchange close to the airport, where the Bundesautobahn 3 (A3), Cologne to Würzburg, and the Bundesautobahn 5 (A5), Basel to Hanover, meet. With approximately 320,000 cars passing through it every day, it is Europe&#x27;s most heavily used interchange. The Bundesautobahn 66 (A66) connects Frankfurt with Wiesbaden in the west and Fulda in the east. The Bundesautobahn 661 (A661) is mainly a commuter motorway that starts in the south (Egelsbach), runs through the eastern part and ends in the north (Oberursel). The Bundesautobahn 648 (A648) is a very short motorway in the western part which primarily serves as a fast connection between the A 66 and the Frankfurt Trade Fair. The A5 in the west, the A3 in the south and the A661 in the northeast form a ring road around the inner city districts and define a Low-emission zone (&quot;Umweltzone&quot;; established in 2008), meaning that vehicles have to meet certain emission criteria to enter the zone.

The streets of central Frankfurt are usually congested with cars during rush hour. Some areas, especially around the shopping streets Zeil, Goethestraße and Freßgass, are pedestrian-only streets.

===Railway stations===
====Frankfurt Central Station====
(&quot;Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof&quot;, often abbreviated as &quot;Frankfurt (Main) Hbf&quot; or &quot;F-Hbf&quot;) is the largest railway station in Germany by railway traffic. By daily passenger volume, it ranks second (493,000 each) after Hamburg Central Station (550,000). It is located between the Gallus, the Gutleutviertel and the Bahnhofsviertel district, not far away from the trade fair and the financial district. It serves as a major hub for long-distance trains (InterCity, ICE) and regional trains as well as for Frankfurt&#x27;s public transport system. It is a stop for most of ICE high-speed lines, making it Germany&#x27;s most important ICE station. ICE Trains to London via the Channel Tunnel were planned for 2013. All Rhine-Main S-Bahn lines, two U-Bahn lines (U4, U5), several tram and bus lines stop there. Regional and local trains are integrated in the Public transport system Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (RMV), the second-largest integrated public transport systems in the world, after Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg.

====Frankfurt Airport stations====

Frankfurt Airport can be accessed by two railway stations: Frankfurt Airport long-distance station (&quot;Frankfurt Flughafen Fernbahnhof&quot;) is only for long-distance traffic and connects the airport to the main rail network, with most of the ICE services using the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line. The long-distance station is located outside the actual airport ground but has a connecting bridge for pedestrians to Terminal 1, concourse B. Frankfurt Airport regional station (&quot;Frankfurt Flughafen Regionalbahnhof&quot;) is for local S-Bahn trains (lines S8, S9) and regional trains. The regional station is located within Terminal 1, concourse B.

====Frankfurt South station====
Frankfurt&#x27;s third long-distance station is Frankfurt South station (&quot;Frankfurt Südbahnhof&quot;, often abbreviated as &quot;Frankfurt (Main) Süd&quot; or &quot;F-Süd&quot;), located in Sachsenhausen. It is an important destination for local trains and trams (lines 15, 16 and 18) and the terminal stop for four U-Bahn lines (U1, U2, U3, U8) as well as three S-Bahn lines (S3, S4, S5). Line S6 also serves the station.

====Messe stations====
The Frankfurt Trade Fair offers two railway stations: Messe station is for local S-Bahn trains (lines S3-S6) and is centrally located amid trade fair premises, while Festhalle/Messe station is served by U-Bahn line U4 and is located at the north-east corner of the premises.

====Konstablerwache station and Hauptwache station====
Two other major downtown railway stations are Konstablerwache and Hauptwache, located on each end of the Zeil. They are the main stations to change from east-to-west-bound S-Bahn trains to north-to-south-bound U-Bahn trains. Konstablerwache station is the second-busiest railway station regarding daily passenger volume (98,000) after the central station. The third-busiest railway station is Hauptwache station (93,000).

====Frankfurt West Station====

This Station, located in Bockenheim, is served by north-heading Long-Distance ICE trains, multiple regional trains, and four commuter S-Bahn lines (S3, S4, S5, S6). Additionally, it is an important terminal stop for three &quot;Metrobus&quot; lines (M32, M36, M73).

===Coach stations===
There are three stations for intercity bus services in Frankfurt: one at the south side of the Central Station, one at the Terminal 2 of the airport and another one at Stephanstraße.

===Public transport===
The city has two rapid transit systems: the U-Bahn and the S-Bahn, as well as an above-ground tram system. Information about the U- and S-Bahn can be found on the website of the RMV.

====S-Bahn====

Nine S-Bahn lines (S1 to S9) connect Frankfurt with the densely populated Rhine Main Region. Most routes have at least 15-minute service during the day, either by one line running every 15 minutes, or by two lines servicing one route at a 30-minute interval. All lines, except line S7, run through the Frankfurt City Tunnel and serve stations at Ostendstraße, Konstablerwache, Hauptwache, Taunusanlage and Frankfurt Central Station. When leaving the city the S-Bahn travels above ground. It provides access to the trade fair (S3, S4, S5, S6), the airport (S8, S9), the stadium (S7, S8, S9) and nearby cities such as Wiesbaden, Mainz, Darmstadt, Rüsselsheim, Hanau, Offenbach am Main, Oberursel, Bad Homburg, Kronberg, Friedberg and smaller towns that are on the way. The S8/S9 runs 24/7.

====U-Bahn====
The U-Bahn has nine lines (U1 to U9) serving Frankfurt and the larger suburbs of Bad Homburg and Oberursel in the north. The trains that run on the U-Bahn are in fact light rail (&quot;Stadtbahn&quot;) as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 7.5- to 10-minute intervals, which produce between 3- and 5-minute intervals on downtown tracks shared by more than one line.

====Tram====

Frankfurt has ten tram lines (11, 12, 14 to 21), with trams arriving usually every 10 minutes. Many sections are served by two lines, combining to run at 5-minute intervals during rush-hour. Trams only run above ground and serve more stops than the U-Bahn or the S-Bahn.

====Bus====

A number of bus lines complete the Frankfurt public transport system. Night buses replace U-Bahn and tram services between 1:30 am and 3:30 am. The central junction for the night bus service is at the downtown square of Konstablerwache, where all night bus lines start and end.

===Taxis===
Taxicabs can usually be found outside the major S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations, at the central station, the south station, the airport, the trade fair and in the crowded inner-city shopping streets. The common way to obtain a taxi is to either call a taxi operator or to go to a taxi rank. However, although not the norm, one can hail a passing taxi on the street.

Uber ceased operations in Frankfurt on 9 November 2015 after operating in the city for 18 months. However, UberX and local cabs are available through the Uber app.

===Bicycles===

Deutsche Bahn makes bicycles available for hire through their Call a Bike service. The bicycles are stationed all over the city, including at selected railway stations. They can easily be spotted because of their eye-catching silver-red color. To rent a specific bike, riders either call a service number to get an unlock code or reserve the bike via the smartphone application. To return the bike, the rider locks it within a designated return area (and calls the service number, if not booked via the app).

Nextbike also makes bicycles available for hire in Frankfurt. They are stationed all over the city. These can be spotted with their blue color scheme.

Cycle rickshaws (velotaxis), a type of tricycle designed to carry passengers in addition to the driver, are also available. These are allowed to operate in pedestrian-only areas and are therefore practical for sightseeing.

Frankfurt has a network of cycle routes. Many long-distance bike routes into the city have cycle tracks that are separate from motor vehicle traffic. A number of downtown roads are &quot;bicycle streets&quot; where the cyclist has the right of way and where motorized vehicles are only allowed access if they do not disrupt the cycle users. In addition, cyclists are allowed to ride many cramped one-way streets in both directions. , 15 percent of citizens used bicycles.

===E-Scooters===
Since 15 June 2019, the use of e-scooters was officially permitted by the German federal government. In Frankfurt, companies like Lime, TIER, Bird, voi., Dott or Bolt are offering their electric micro mobility vehicles for lease. However, their use is being regarded with increasing weariness due to frequent abuse (parking, speeding, vandalism, accidents) and has sparked a public debate about the need of further regulation of the e-scooter market.

<doc id="10993" wikidata="Q168657" url="?curid=10993" title="Albert, King of Saxony">
<text>Albert (23 April 1828 – 19 June 1902) was King of Saxony from 29 October 1873 until his death in 1902.

He was the eldest son of Prince John (who succeeded his brother Frederick Augustus II on the Saxon throne as King John in 1854) by his wife Amalie Auguste of Bavaria.

Albert had a successful military career, leading Saxon troops that participated in the First Schleswig War, the Austro-Prussian War, and the Franco-Prussian War.

==Early life==
Albert&#x27;s education, as usual with German princes, concentrated to a great extent on military matters, but he attended lectures at the University of Bonn. His first experience of warfare came in 1849, when he served as a captain in the First War of Schleswig against Denmark.

When the Austro-Prussian War broke out in 1866, Albert, then Crown Prince (German: &quot;Kronprinz&quot;), took up the command of the Saxon forces opposing the Prussian Army of Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia. No attempt was made to defend Saxony, and the Saxons fell back into Bohemia and effected a junction with the Austrians. They took a prominent part in the battles by which the Prussians forced the line of the Jizera and in the Battle of Jičín. The Crown Prince, however, succeeded in effecting the retreat in good order, and in the decisive Battle of Königgrätz (3 July 1866), he held the extreme left of the Austrian position. The Saxons maintained their post with great tenacity but were involved in the disastrous defeat of their allies.

During the operations, the Crown Prince won the reputation of a thorough soldier. After peace was made and Saxony had entered the North German Confederation, he gained the command of the Saxon army, which had now become the XII army corps of the North German army, and in that position, he carried out the necessary reorganisation. He proved a firm adherent of the Prussian alliance. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, he again commanded the Saxons, who were included in the 2nd army under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, his old opponent. At the Battle of Gravelotte, they formed the extreme left of the German army, and with the Prussian Guard carried out the attack on St Privat, the final and decisive action in the battle.

In the reorganisation of the army which accompanied the march towards Paris, the Crown Prince gained a separate command over the 4th army (Army of the Meuse) consisting of the Saxons, the Prussian Guard corps, and the IV (Prussian Saxony) corps. He was succeeded in command of the XII corps by his brother Prince George, who had served under him in Bohemia.

Albert took a leading part in the operations which preceded the battle of Sedan, the 4th army being the pivot on which the whole army wheeled round in pursuit of MacMahon; and the actions of Buzancy and Beaumont on 29 and 30 August 1870 were fought under his direction. In the Battle of Sedan itself (1 September 1870), with the troops under his orders, Albert carried out the envelopment of the French on the east and the north.

Albert&#x27;s conduct in the engagements won for him the complete confidence of the army, and during the Siege of Paris, his troops formed the north-east section of the investing force. During the siege, he blocked French attempts to break out of the encirclement at Le Bourget and Villiers. After the conclusion of the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871), he was left in command of the German army of occupation, a position which he held till the fall of the Paris Commune. On the conclusion of peace, he was made an inspector-general of the army and a field marshal.

==King==
On the death of his father, King John on 29 October 1873, the Crown Prince succeeded to the throne as King Albert. His reign proved uneventful, and he took little public part in politics, devoting himself to military affairs, in which his advice and experience were of the greatest value, not only to the Saxon corps but also to the German army in general. During his reign, the Saxon monarchy became constitutional.

In the 1870s, Albert initiated the construction of a Dresden suburb, the Albertstadt. It was then the largest garrison in Germany. Near the former suburb other buildings and places still bear his name: the Albertbrücke, the Alberthafen, the Albertplatz and the Albertinum.

In 1879, he initiated the reconstruction of the Saint Afra School in Meissen. In 1897, he was appointed arbitrator between the claimants for the Principality of Lippe.

==Marriage and succession==
In Dresden on 18 June 1853, Albert married Princess Carola, daughter of Gustav, Prince of Vasa and granddaughter of Gustav IV Adolf, the second to last king of Sweden of the House of Holstein-Gottorp. The marriage was childless although Carola miscarried many times. They included:
* A miscarriage of a daughter in the 4th month of pregnancy (19 December 1853).
* A miscarriage of a daughter in the 6th month of pregnancy (16 August 1854).
* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (22 January 1855).
* A miscarriage of a son in the 4th and a half month of pregnancy (17 January 1856).
* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (4 December 1856).
* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (30 January 1857).
* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (30 March 1857).
* A miscarriage of a son in the 5th and a half month of pregnancy (11 January 1858).
* A miscarriage of a son in the 4th and a half month of pregnancy (20 March 1859).
* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (30 March 1860).

Albert died at his Sibyllenort Palace on 19 June 1902 and was succeeded by his brother, who became King George. He was buried in Dresden on 23 June, among the mourners present were both the German Emperor Wilhelm II and the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I.

==Honours, decorations and awards==

The King of Saxony bird-of-paradise was named in Albert&#x27;s honour; the Queen Carola&#x27;s parotia was named for his wife.

<doc id="10996" wikidata="Q1003681" url="?curid=10996" title="François d'Aguilon">
<text>François d&#x27;Aguilon (; also d&#x27;Aguillon or in Latin Franciscus Aguilonius) (4 January 1567 – 20 March 1617) was a Jesuit, mathematician, physicist, and architect from the Spanish Netherlands.

D&#x27;Aguilon was born in Brussels; his father was a secretary to Philip II of Spain. He became a Jesuit in Tournai in 1586. In 1598 he moved to Antwerp, where he helped plan the construction of the Saint Carolus Borromeus church. In 1611, he started a special school of mathematics in Antwerp, fulfilling a dream of Christopher Clavius for a Jesuit mathematical school; in 1616, he was joined there by Grégoire de Saint-Vincent. The notable geometers educated at this school included Jean-Charles della Faille, André Tacquet, and Theodorus Moretus.

His book, &quot;Opticorum Libri Sex philosophis juxta ac mathematicis utiles,&quot; or &quot;Six Books of Optics,&quot; is useful for philosophers and mathematicians. It was published by Balthasar I Moretus in Antwerp in 1613 and illustrated by the famous painter Peter Paul Rubens. It included one of the first studies of binocular vision. It also gave the names we now use to stereographic projection and orthographic projection, although the projections themselves were likely known to Hipparchus. This book inspired the works of Desargues and Christiaan Huygens.

He died in Antwerp, aged 50.

== Six Books of Optics ==
Francois d&#x27;Aguilon&#x27;s &quot;Six Books of Optics&quot; concerns geometrical optics, which at the time in the Jesuit school was a subcategory of geometry. He taught logic, syntax, and theology while being charged with organizing the teaching of geometry and science which would be useful for geography, navigation, architecture and the military arts in Belgium. His superiors wanted him to synthesize the work of Euclid, Alhazen, Vitello, Roger Bacon and others. Although he died before completing the book, it still consists of six in-depth books, called &quot;Opticorum Libri Sex.&quot;

=== Perception and the horopter ===
D&#x27;Aguilon extensively studied stereographic projection, which he wanted to use a means to aid architects, cosmographers, navigators and artists. For centuries, artists and architects had sought formal laws of projection to place objects on a screen. Aguilon&#x27;s &quot;Opticorum libri sex&quot; successfully treated projections and the errors in perception. D&#x27;Aguillon adopted Alhazen&#x27;s theory that only light rays orthogonal to the cornea and lens surface are clearly registered. Aguilon was the first to use the term horopter, which is the line drawn through the focal point of both eyes and parallel to the line between the eyes. In other words, it describes how only objects on the horopter are seen in their true location. He then built an instrument to measure the spacing of double images in the horopter as he saw fit.

D&#x27;Aguilon expanded on the horopter by saying in his book: 

At first glance, it seems that Aguillon discovered the geometrical horopter more than 200 years before Prevost and Vieth and Muller. The horopter was then used by architect Girard Desargues, who in 1639 published a remarkable treatise on the conic sections, emphasizing the idea of projection.

=== Similarity to other theorists ===
In Aguilon&#x27;s book there are elements of perspectivities as well as the stereographic projections of Ptolemy and Hipparchus. Unaware that Johannes Kepler had already published optical theories years before him, Aguilon decided to share his insights on geometric optics. At the age of 20, the Dutch poet Constantijn Huygens read Aguilon&#x27;s and was enthralled by it. He later said that it was the best book he had ever read in geometrical optics, and he thought that Aguilon should be compared to Plato, Eudoxus and Archimedes. In fact the title of Constantijn Huygens&#x27; first publication imitated Aguilon&#x27;s title (omitting letters p and c): Otiorum Libri Sex (1625).

=== Accompanying art ===
In Aguilon&#x27;s book the beginning of each section had works of the Flemish Baroque painter, Peter Paul Rubens. The frontispiece at the beginning of the book shows an eagle, referring to Aguilon&#x27;s name and a variety of optical and geometrical images. On either side of the title stands Mercury holding the head of Argus with a hundred eyes, and Minerva holding a shield reflecting the head of Medusa. Then, at the beginning of each of six sections are Rubens&#x27; drawings describing Aguilon&#x27;s experiments, one of which is the first known picture of a photometer This is one of six experiments drawn by Rubens and shows how intensity of light varies with the square of distance from the source. The experiment was later taken up by Mersenne and another Jesuit, Claude de Chales, and eventually led to Bouguer&#x27;s more famous photometer. It is evident, from the detail that he put into his drawings, how enthused Rubens was about the subject matter, perspective geometry and optical rules.

<text>Hyphanet (until mid-2023: Freenet) is a peer-to-peer platform for censorship-resistant, anonymous communication. It uses a decentralized distributed data store to keep and deliver information, and has a suite of free software for publishing and communicating on the Web without fear of censorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peers in a Client/Server World, 2005&quot;&gt;Taylor, Ian J. &quot;From P2P to Web Services and Grids: Peers in a Client/Server World&quot;. London: Springer, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Freenet and some of its associated tools were originally designed by Ian Clarke, who defined Freenet&#x27;s goal as providing freedom of speech on the Internet with strong anonymity protection.

The distributed data store of Freenet is used by many third-party programs and plugins to provide microblogging and media sharing, anonymous and decentralised version tracking, blogging, a generic web of trust for decentralized spam resistance, Shoeshop for using Freenet over sneakernet, and many more.

==History==
The origin of Freenet can be traced to Ian Clarke&#x27;s student project at the University of Edinburgh, which he completed as a graduation requirement in the summer of 1999. Ian Clarke&#x27;s resulting unpublished report &quot;A distributed decentralized information storage and retrieval system&quot; (1999) provided foundation for the seminal paper written in collaboration with other researchers, &quot;Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous Information Storage and Retrieval System&quot; (2001). According to CiteSeer, it became one of the most frequently cited computer science articles in 2002.

Freenet can provide anonymity on the Internet by storing small encrypted snippets of content distributed on the computers of its users and connecting only through intermediate computers which pass on requests for content and sending them back without knowing the contents of the full file. This is similar to how routers on the Internet route packets without knowing anything about filesexcept Freenet has caching, a layer of strong encryption, and no reliance on centralized structures. This allows users to publish anonymously or retrieve various kinds of information.

===Release history===

Freenet has been under continuous development since 2000.

Freenet 0.7, released on 8 May 2008, is a major re-write incorporating a number of fundamental changes. The most fundamental change is support for darknet operation. Version 0.7 offered two modes of operation: a mode in which it connects only to friends, and an opennet-mode in which it connects to any other Freenet user. Both modes can be run simultaneously. When a user switches to pure darknet operation, Freenet becomes very difficult to detect from the outside. The transport layer created for the darknet mode allows communication over restricted routes as commonly found in mesh networks, as long as these connections follow a small-world structure. Other modifications include switching from TCP to UDP, which allows UDP hole punching along with faster transmission of messages between peers in the network.

Freenet 0.7.5, released on 12 June 2009, offers a variety of improvements over 0.7. These include reduced memory usage, faster insert and retrieval of content, significant improvements to the FProxy web interface used for browsing freesites, and a large number of smaller bugfixes, performance enhancements, and usability improvements. Version 0.7.5 also shipped with a new version of the Windows installer.

As of build 1226, released on 30 July 2009, features that have been written include significant security improvements against both attackers acting on the network and physical seizure of the computer running the node.

As of build 1468, released on 11 July 2015, the Freenet core stopped using the db4o database and laid the foundation for an efficient interface to the Web of Trust plugin which provides spam resistance.

Freenet has always been free software, but until 2011 it required users to install Java. This problem was solved by making Freenet compatible with OpenJDK, a free and open source implementation of the Java Platform.

On 11 February 2015, Freenet received the SUMA-Award for &quot;protection against total surveillance&quot;.

==Features and user interface==
Freenet served as the model for the Japanese peer to peer file-sharing programs Winny, Share and Perfect Dark, but this model differs from p2p networks such as Bittorrent and emule. Freenet separates the underlying network structure and protocol from how users interact with the network; as a result, there are a variety of ways to access content on the Freenet network. The simplest is via FProxy, which is integrated with the node software and provides a web interface to content on the network. Using FProxy, a user can browse freesites (websites that use normal HTML and related tools, but whose content is stored within Freenet rather than on a traditional web server). The web interface is also used for most configuration and node management tasks. Through the use of separate applications or plugins loaded into the node software, users can interact with the network in other ways, such as forums similar to web forums or Usenet or interfaces more similar to traditional P2P &quot;filesharing&quot; interfaces.

While Freenet provides an HTTP interface for browsing freesites, it is not a proxy for the World Wide Web; Freenet can be used to access only the content that has been previously inserted into the Freenet network. In this way, it is more similar to Tor&#x27;s onion services than to anonymous proxy software like Tor&#x27;s proxy.

Freenet&#x27;s focus lies on free speech and anonymity. Because of that, Freenet acts differently at certain points that are (directly or indirectly) related to the anonymity part. Freenet attempts to protect the anonymity of both people inserting data into the network (uploading) and those retrieving data from the network (downloading). Unlike file sharing systems, there is no need for the uploader to remain on the network after uploading a file or group of files. Instead, during the upload process, the files are broken into chunks and stored on a variety of other computers on the network. When downloading, those chunks are found and reassembled. Every node on the Freenet network contributes storage space to hold files and bandwidth that it uses to route requests from its peers.

As a direct result of the anonymity requirements, the node requesting content does not normally connect directly to the node that has it; instead, the request is routed across several intermediaries, none of which know which node made the request or which one had it. As a result, the total bandwidth required by the network to transfer a file is higher than in other systems, which can result in slower transfers, especially for infrequently accessed content.

Since version 0.7, Freenet offers two different levels of security: opennet and darknet. With opennet, users connect to arbitrary other users. With darknet, users connect only to &quot;friends&quot; with whom they previously exchanged public keys, named node-references. Both modes can be used together.

==Content==
Freenet&#x27;s founders argue that true freedom of speech comes only with true anonymity and that the beneficial uses of Freenet outweigh its negative uses. Their view is that free speech, in itself, is not in contradiction with any other consideration—the information is not the crime. Freenet attempts to remove the possibility of any group imposing its beliefs or values on any data. Although many states censor communications to different extents, they all share one commonality in that a body must decide what information to censor and what information to allow. What may be acceptable to one group of people may be considered offensive or even dangerous to another. In essence, the purpose of Freenet is to ensure that no one is allowed to decide what is acceptable.

Reports of Freenet&#x27;s use in authoritarian nations is difficult to track due to the very nature of Freenet&#x27;s goals. One group, &quot;Freenet China&quot;, used to introduce the Freenet software to Chinese users starting from 2001 and distribute it within China through e-mails and on disks after the group&#x27;s website was blocked by the Chinese authorities on the mainland. It was reported that in 2002 &quot;Freenet China&quot; had several thousand dedicated users. However, Freenet opennet traffic was blocked in China around the 2010s.

==Technical design==
The Freenet file sharing network stores documents and allows them to be retrieved later by an associated key, as is now possible with protocols such as HTTP. The network is designed to be highly survivable. The system has no central servers and is not subject to the control of any one individual or organization, including the designers of Freenet. The codebase size is over 192,000 lines of code. Information stored on Freenet is distributed around the network and stored on several different nodes. Encryption of data and relaying of requests makes it difficult to determine who inserted content into Freenet, who requested that content, or where the content was stored. This protects the anonymity of participants, and also makes it very difficult to censor specific content. Content is stored encrypted, making it difficult for even the operator of a node to determine what is stored on that node. This provides plausible deniability; which, in combination with request relaying, means that safe harbor laws that protect service providers may also protect Freenet node operators. When asked about the topic, Freenet developers defer to the EFF discussion which says that not being able to filter anything is a safe choice.

===Distributed storage and caching of data===
Like Winny, Share and Perfect Dark, Freenet not only transmits data between nodes but actually stores them, working as a huge distributed cache. To achieve this, each node allocates some amount of disk space to store data; this is configurable by the node operator, but is typically several GB (or more).

Files on Freenet are typically split into multiple small blocks, with duplicate blocks created to provide redundancy. Each block is handled independently, meaning that a single file may have parts stored on many different nodes.

Information flow in Freenet is different from networks like eMule or BitTorrent; in Freenet:

# A user wishing to share a file or update a freesite &quot;inserts&quot; the file &quot;to the network&quot;
# After &quot;insertion&quot; is finished, the publishing node is free to shut down, because the file is stored in the network. It will remain available for other users whether or not the original publishing node is online. No single node is responsible for the content; instead, it is replicated to many different nodes.

Two advantages of this design are high reliability and anonymity. Information remains available even if the publisher node goes offline, and is anonymously spread over many hosting nodes as encrypted blocks, not entire files.

The key disadvantage of the storage method is that no one node is responsible for any chunk of data. If a piece of data is not retrieved for some time and a node keeps getting new data, it will drop the old data sometime when its allocated disk space is fully used. In this way Freenet tends to &#x27;forget&#x27; data which is not retrieved regularly (see also Effect).

While users can insert data into the network, there is no way to delete data. Due to Freenet&#x27;s anonymous nature the original publishing node or owner of any piece of data is unknown. The only way data can be removed is if users don&#x27;t request it.

===Network===
Typically, a host computer on the network runs the software that acts as a node, and it connects to other hosts running that same software to form a large distributed, variable-size network of peer nodes. Some nodes are end user nodes, from which documents are requested and presented to human users. Other nodes serve only to route data. All nodes communicate with each other identically – there are no dedicated &quot;clients&quot; or &quot;servers&quot;. It is not possible for a node to rate another node except by its capacity to insert and fetch data associated with a key. This is unlike most other P2P networks where node administrators can employ a ratio system, where users have to share a certain amount of content before they can download.

Freenet may also be considered a small world network.

The Freenet protocol is intended to be used on a network of complex topology, such as the Internet (Internet Protocol). Each node knows only about some number of other nodes that it can reach directly (its conceptual &quot;neighbors&quot;), but any node can be a neighbor to any other; no hierarchy or other structure is intended. Each message is routed through the network by passing from neighbor to neighbor until it reaches its destination. As each node passes a message to a neighbor, it does not know whether the neighbor will forward the message to another node, or is the final destination or original source of the message. This is intended to protect the anonymity of users and publishers.

Each node maintains a data store containing documents associated with keys, and a routing table associating nodes with records of their performance in retrieving different keys.

===Protocol===
The Freenet protocol uses a key-based routing protocol, similar to distributed hash tables. The routing algorithm changed significantly in version 0.7. Prior to version 0.7, Freenet used a heuristic routing algorithm where each node had no fixed location, and routing was based on which node had served a key closest to the key being fetched (in version 0.3) or which is estimated to serve it faster (in version 0.5). In either case, new connections were sometimes added to downstream nodes (i.e. the node that answered the request) when requests succeeded, and old nodes were discarded in least recently used order (or something close to it). Oskar Sandberg&#x27;s research (during the development of version 0.7) shows that this &quot;path folding&quot; is critical, and that a very simple routing algorithm will suffice provided there is path folding.

The disadvantage of this is that it is very easy for an attacker to find Freenet nodes, and connect to them, because every node is continually attempting to find new connections. In version 0.7, Freenet supports both &quot;opennet&quot; (similar to the old algorithms, but simpler), and &quot;darknet&quot; (all node connections are set up manually, so only your friends know your node&#x27;s IP address). Darknet is less convenient, but much more secure against a distant attacker.

This change required major changes in the routing algorithm. Every node has a location, which is a number between 0 and 1. When a key is requested, first the node checks the local data store. If it&#x27;s not found, the key&#x27;s hash is turned into another number in the same range, and the request is routed to the node whose location is closest to the key. This goes on until some number of hops is exceeded, there are no more nodes to search, or the data is found. If the data is found, it is cached on each node along the path. So there is no one source node for a key, and attempting to find where it is currently stored will result in it being cached more widely. Essentially the same process is used to insert a document into the network: the data is routed according to the key until it runs out of hops, and if no existing document is found with the same key, it is stored on each node. If older data is found, the older data is propagated and returned to the originator, and the insert &quot;collides&quot;.

But this works only if the locations are clustered in the right way. Freenet assumes that the darknet (a subset of the global social network) is a small-world network, and nodes constantly attempt to swap locations (using the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm) in order to minimize their distance to their neighbors. If the network actually is a small-world network, Freenet should find data reasonably quickly; ideally on the order of formula_1 hops in big O notation. However, it does not guarantee that data will be found at all.

Eventually, either the document is found or the hop limit is exceeded. The terminal node sends a reply that makes its way back to the originator along the route specified by the intermediate nodes&#x27; records of pending requests. The intermediate nodes may choose to cache the document along the way. Besides saving bandwidth, this also makes documents harder to censor as there is no one &quot;source node&quot;.

===Effect===

Initially, the locations in darknet are distributed randomly. This means that routing of requests is essentially random. In opennet connections are established by a join request which provides an optimized network structure if the existing network is already optimized. So the data in a newly started Freenet will be distributed somewhat randomly.

As location swapping (on darknet) and path folding (on opennet) progress, nodes which are close to one another will increasingly have close locations, and nodes which are far away will have distant locations. Data with similar keys will be stored on the same node.

The result is that the network will self-organize into a distributed, clustered structure where nodes tend to hold data items that are close together in key space. There will probably be multiple such clusters throughout the network, any given document being replicated numerous times, depending on how much it is used. This is a kind of &quot;spontaneous symmetry breaking&quot;, in which an initially symmetric state (all nodes being the same, with random initial keys for each other) leads to a highly asymmetric situation, with nodes coming to specialize in data that has closely related keys.

There are forces which tend to cause clustering (shared closeness data spreads throughout the network), and forces that tend to break up clusters (local caching of commonly used data). These forces will be different depending on how often data is used, so that seldom-used data will tend to be on just a few nodes which specialize in providing that data, and frequently used items will be spread widely throughout the network. This automatic mirroring counteracts the times when web traffic becomes overloaded, and due to a mature network&#x27;s intelligent routing, a network of size &quot;n&quot; should require only log(&quot;n&quot;) time to retrieve a document on average.

===Keys===
Keys are hashes: there is no notion of semantic closeness when speaking of key closeness. Therefore, there will be no correlation between key closeness and similar popularity of data as there might be if keys did exhibit some semantic meaning, thus avoiding bottlenecks caused by popular subjects.

There are two main varieties of keys in use on Freenet, the Content Hash Key (CHK) and the Signed Subspace Key (SSK). A subtype of SSKs is the Updatable Subspace Key (USK) which adds versioning to allow secure updating of content.

A CHK is a SHA-256 hash of a document (after encryption, which itself depends on the hash of the plaintext) and thus a node can check that the document returned is correct by hashing it and checking the digest against the key. This key contains the meat of the data on Freenet. It carries all the binary data building blocks for the content to be delivered to the client for reassembly and decryption. The CHK is unique by nature and provides tamperproof content. A hostile node altering the data under a CHK will immediately be detected by the next node or the client. CHKs also reduce the redundancy of data since the same data will have the same CHK and when multiple sites reference the same large files, they can reference to the same CHK.

SSKs are based on public-key cryptography. Currently Freenet uses the DSA algorithm. Documents inserted under SSKs are signed by the inserter, and this signature can be verified by every node to ensure that the data is not tampered with. SSKs can be used to establish a verifiable pseudonymous identity on Freenet, and allow for multiple documents to be inserted securely by a single person. Files inserted with an SSK are effectively immutable, since inserting a second file with the same name can cause collisions. USKs resolve this by adding a version number to the keys which is also used for providing update notification for keys registered as bookmarks in the web interface. Another subtype of the SSK is the Keyword Signed Key, or KSK, in which the key pair is generated in a standard way from a simple human-readable string. Inserting a document using a KSK allows the document to be retrieved and decrypted if and only if the requester knows the human-readable string; this allows for more convenient (but less secure) URIs for users to refer to.

==Scalability==
A network is said to be scalable if its performance does not deteriorate even if the network is very large. The scalability of Freenet is being evaluated, but similar architectures have been shown to scale logarithmically. This work indicates that Freenet can find data in formula_2 hops on a small-world network (which includes both opennet and darknet style Freenet networks), when ignoring the caching which could improve the scalability for popular content. However, this scalability is difficult to test without a very large network. Furthermore, the security features inherent to Freenet make detailed performance analysis (including things as simple as determining the size of the network) difficult to do accurately. As of now, the scalability of Freenet has yet to be tested.

==Darknet versus opennet==
As of version 0.7, Freenet supports both &quot;darknet&quot; and &quot;opennet&quot; connections. Opennet connections are made automatically by nodes with opennet enabled, while darknet connections are manually established between users that know and trust each other. Freenet developers describe the trust needed as &quot;will not crack their Freenet node&quot;. Opennet connections are easy to use, but darknet connections are more secure against attackers on the network, and can make it difficult for an attacker (such as an oppressive government) to even determine that a user is running Freenet in the first place.

The core innovation in Freenet 0.7 is to allow a globally scalable darknet, capable (at least in theory) of supporting millions of users. Previous darknets, such as WASTE, have been limited to relatively small disconnected networks. The scalability of Freenet is made possible by the fact that human relationships tend to form small-world networks, a property that can be exploited to find short paths between any two people. The work is based on a speech given at DEF CON 13 by Ian Clarke and Swedish mathematician Oskar Sandberg. Furthermore, the routing algorithm is capable of routing over a mixture of opennet and darknet connections, allowing people who have only a few friends using the network to get the performance from having sufficient connections while still receiving some of the security benefits of darknet connections. This also means that small darknets where some users also have opennet connections are fully integrated into the whole Freenet network, allowing all users access to all content, whether they run opennet, darknet, or a hybrid of the two, except for darknet pockets connected only by a single hybrid node.

== Tools and applications ==
Unlike many other P2P applications Freenet does not provide comprehensive functionality itself. Freenet is modular and features an API called Freenet Client Protocol (FCP) for other programs to use to implement services such as message boards, file sharing, or online chat.

===Communication===
Freenet Messaging System (FMS)
:FMS was designed to address problems with Frost such as denial of service attacks and spam. Users publish trust lists, and each user downloads messages only from identities they trust and identities trusted by identities they trust. FMS is developed anonymously and can be downloaded from &quot;the FMS freesite&quot; within Freenet. It does not have an official site on the normal Internet. It features random post delay, support for many identities, and a distinction between trusting a user&#x27;s posts and trusting their trust list. It is written in C++ and is a separate application from Freenet which uses the Freenet Client Protocol (FCP) to interface with Freenet.
Frost
:Frost includes support for convenient file sharing, but its design is inherently vulnerable to spam and denial of service attacks. Frost can be downloaded from the Frost home page on SourceForge, or from &quot;the Frost freesite&quot; within Freenet. It is not endorsed by the Freenet developers. Frost is written in Java and is a separate application from Freenet.
Sone
:Sone provides a simpler interface inspired by Facebook with public anonymous discussions and image galleries. It provides an API for control from other programs is also used to implement a comment system for static websites in the regular internet.

===Utilities===
jSite
:jSite is a tool to upload websites. It handles keys and manages uploading files.
Infocalypse
:Infocalypse is an extension for the distributed revision control system Mercurial. It uses an optimized structure to minimize the number of requests to retrieve new data, and allows supporting a repository by securely reuploading most parts of the data without requiring the owner&#x27;s private keys.

===Libraries===
FCPLib
:FCPLib (Freenet Client Protocol Library) aims to be a cross-platform natively compiled set of C++-based functions for storing and retrieving information to and from Freenet. FCPLib supports Windows NT/2K/XP, Debian, BSD, Solaris, and macOS.
lib-pyFreenet
:lib-pyFreenet exposes Freenet functionality to Python programs. Infocalypse uses it.

==Vulnerabilities==
Law enforcement agencies have claimed to have successfully infiltrated Freenet opennet in order to deanonymize users but no technical details have been given to support these allegations. One report stated that, &quot;A child-porn investigation focused on ... [the suspect] when the authorities were monitoring the online network, Freenet.&quot; A different report indicated arrests may have been based on the BlackICE project leaks, that are debunked for using bad math and for using an incorrectly calculated false positives rate and a false model.

A court case in the Peel Region of Ontario, &quot;Canada R. v. Owen&quot;, 2017 ONCJ 729 (CanLII), illustrated that law enforcement do in fact have a presence, after Peel Regional Police located who had been downloading illegal material on the Freenet network. The court decision indicates that a Canadian Law Enforcement agency operates nodes running modified Freenet software in the hope of determining who is requesting illegal material.

*Routing Table Insertion (RTI) Attack

==Notability==
Freenet has had significant publicity in the mainstream press, including articles in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and coverage on CNN, &quot;60 Minutes II&quot;, the BBC, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and elsewhere.

Freenet received the SUMA-Award 2014 for &quot;protection against total surveillance&quot;.

==Freesite==
A &quot;freesite&quot; is a site hosted on the Freenet network. Because it contains only static content, it cannot contain any active content like server-side scripts or databases. Freesites are coded in HTML and support as many features as the browser viewing the page allows; however, there are some exceptions where the Freenet software will remove parts of the code that may be used to reveal the identity of the person viewing the page (making a page access something on the internet, for example).

<text>Fortified wine is a wine to which a distilled spirit, usually brandy, has been added. In the course of some centuries, winemakers have developed many different styles of fortified wine, including port, sherry, madeira, Marsala, Commandaria wine, and the aromatised wine vermouth.

==Production==
One reason for fortifying wine was to preserve it, since ethanol is also a natural antiseptic. Even though other preservation methods now exist, fortification continues to be used because the process can add distinct flavors to the finished product.

Although grape brandy is most commonly added to produce fortified wines, the additional alcohol may also be neutral spirit that has been made from grapes, grain, sugar beets or sugarcane. Regional appellation laws may dictate the types of spirit that are permitted for fortification. For example, in the U.S. only spirits made from the same fruit as the wine may be added.

The source of the additional alcohol and the method of its distillation can affect the flavour of the fortified wine. If neutral spirit is used, it is usually produced with a continuous still, rather than a pot still.

When added to wine before the fermentation process is complete, the alcohol in the distilled beverage kills the yeast and leaves residual sugar behind. The result is a wine that is both sweeter and stronger, normally containing about 20% alcohol by volume (ABV).

During the fermentation process, yeast cells in the &quot;must&quot; continue to convert sugar into alcohol until the must reaches an alcohol level of 16–18%. At this level, the alcohol becomes toxic to the yeast and stalls its metabolism. If fermentation is allowed to run to completion, the resulting wine is (in most cases) low in sugar and is considered a dry wine. Adding alcohol earlier in the fermentation process results in a sweeter wine. For drier fortified wine styles, such as sherry, the alcohol is added shortly before or after the end of the fermentation.

In the case of some fortified wine styles (such as late harvest and botrytized wines), a naturally high level of sugar inhibits the yeast, or the rising alcohol content due to the high sugar kills the yeast. This causes fermentation to stop before the wine can become dry.

==Varieties==
===Commandaria wine===

Commandaria is made in Cyprus&#x27; unique AOC region north of Limassol from high-altitude vines of Mavro and Xynisteri, sun-dried and aged in oak barrels. Recent developments have produced different styles of Commandaria, some of which are not fortified.

===Madeira wine===
Madeira is a fortified wine made in the Madeira Islands. The wine is produced in a variety of styles ranging from dry wines which can be consumed on their own as an aperitif, to sweet wines more usually consumed with dessert. Madeira is deliberately heated and oxidised as part of its maturation process, resulting in distinctive flavours and an unusually long lifespan once a bottle is opened.

===Marsala wine===

Marsala wine is a wine from Sicily that is available in both fortified and unfortified versions. It was first produced in 1772 by an English merchant, John Woodhouse, as an inexpensive substitute for sherry and port, and gets its name from the island&#x27;s port, Marsala. The fortified version is blended with brandy to make two styles, the younger, slightly weaker &quot;Fine&quot;, which is at least 17% abv and aged at least four months; and the &quot;Superiore&quot;, which is at least 18%, and aged at least two years. The unfortified Marsala wine is aged in wooden casks for five years or more and reaches a strength of 18% by evaporation.

===Mistelle===
Mistelle (; ; Spanish, Portuguese, Galician and , from Latin / &quot;mix&quot;) is sometimes used as an ingredient in fortified wines, particularly Vermouth, Marsala and Sherry, though it is used mainly as a base for apéritifs such as the French Pineau des Charentes. It is produced by adding alcohol to non-fermented or partially fermented grape juice (or apple juice to make pommeau). The addition of alcohol stops the fermentation and, as a consequence Mistelle is sweeter than fully fermented grape juice in which the sugars turn to alcohol.

===Moscatel de Setúbal===

Moscatel de Setúbal is a Portuguese wine produced around the Setúbal Municipality on the Península de Setúbal. The wine is made primarily from the Muscat of Alexandria grape and is typically fortified with aguardente. The style was believed to have been invented by José Maria da Fonseca, the founder of the oldest table wine company in Portugal dating back to 1834.

===Port wine===
Port wine (also known simply as port) is a fortified wine from the Douro Valley in the northern provinces of Portugal. It is typically a sweet red wine, but also comes in dry, semi-dry and white or rosé styles.

===Sherry===
Sherry is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the town of Jerez, Spain. The word &quot;sherry&quot; itself is an anglicisation of Jerez. In earlier times, sherry was known as &quot;sack&quot; (from the Spanish &quot;saca&quot;, meaning &quot;a removal from the solera&quot;). In the European Union &quot;sherry&quot; is a protected designation of origin; therefore, all wine labelled as &quot;sherry&quot; must legally come from the Sherry Triangle, which is an area in the province of Cádiz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa María.

After fermentation is complete, sherry is fortified with brandy. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine (for example) is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.

Sherry is produced in a variety of styles, ranging from dry, light versions such as finos to much darker and sometimes sweeter versions known as olorosos. Cream sherry is always sweet.

===Vermouth===
Vermouth is a fortified wine flavoured with aromatic herbs and spices (&quot;aromatised&quot; in the trade) using closely guarded recipes (trade secrets). Some of the herbs and spices used may include cardamom, cinnamon, marjoram, and chamomile. Some vermouth is sweetened. Unsweetened or dry vermouth tends to be bitter. The person credited with the second vermouth recipe, Antonio Benedetto Carpano from Turin, Italy, chose to name his concoction &quot;vermouth&quot; in 1786 because he was inspired by a German wine flavoured with wormwood, an herb most famously used in distilling absinthe. Wine flavoured with wormwood goes back to ancient Rome. The modern German word &quot;Wermut&quot; (&quot;Wermuth&quot; in the spelling of Carpano&#x27;s time) means both &quot;wormwood&quot; and &quot;vermouth&quot;. The herbs were originally used to mask raw flavours of cheaper wines, imparting a slightly medicinal &quot;tonic&quot; flavor.

===Vins doux naturels===
Vins doux naturels (VDN) are lightly fortified wines typically made from white Muscat grapes or red Grenache grapes in the south of France. As the name suggests, Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, Muscat de Rivesaltes and Muscat de Frontignan are all made from the white Muscat grape, whilst Banyuls and Maury are made from red Grenache. Other wines, like those of Rivesaltes AOC, can be made from red or white grapes. Regardless of the grape, fermentation is stopped by the addition of up to 10% of a 190 proof (95% abv) grape spirit. The Grenache vins doux naturels can be made in an oxidised or unoxidised style whereas the Muscat wines are protected from oxidation to retain their freshness.

===Vins de liqueur===
A vin de liqueur is a sweet fortified style of French wine that is fortified by adding brandy to unfermented grape must. The term vin de liqueur is also used by the European Union to refer to all fortified wines. Vins de liqueur take greater flavour from the added brandy but are also sweeter than vin doux.

Examples include Floc de Gascogne which is made using 1/3 armagnac to 2/3 grape juice from the same vineyard, Pineau des Charentes in the Cognac zone, Macvin in Jura; there is also Pommeau similarly made by blending apple juice and apple brandy.

===Low-end fortified wines===

Inexpensive fortified wines, such as Thunderbird and Wild Irish Rose, became popular during the Great Depression for their relatively high alcohol content. The term &quot;&quot; was coined during this period to describe impoverished alcoholics of the time.

These wines continue to be associated with the homeless, mainly because marketers have been aggressive in targeting low-income communities as ideal consumers of these beverages; organisations in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland have urged makers of inexpensive fortified wine, including E &amp; J Gallo Winery, to stop providing such products to liquor stores in impoverished areas. In 2005, the Seattle City Council asked the Washington State Liquor Control Board to prohibit the sale of certain alcohol products in an impoverished &quot;Alcohol Impact Area.&quot; Among the products sought to be banned were over two dozen beers, and six fortified wines: Cisco, Gino&#x27;s Premium Blend, MD 20/20, Night Train, Thunderbird, and Wild Irish Rose. The Liquor Control Board approved these restrictions on 30 August 2006.

=== Gwaha-ju ===

&quot;Gwaha-ju&quot; is a fortified rice wine made in Korea.
Although rice wine is not made from grapes, it has a similar alcohol content to grape wine, and the addition of the distilled spirit, soju, and other ingredients like ginseng, jujubes, ginger, etc., to the rice wine, bears similarity to the above-mentioned fortified wines.

==Terminology==
Fortified wines are often termed dessert wines in the United States to avoid association with hard drinking. The term &quot;vins de liqueur&quot; is used by the French.

Under European Union legislation, a liqueur wine is a fortified wine that contains 15–22% abv, with Total Alcoholic Strength of no less than 17.5%, and that meets many additional criteria. Exemptions are allowed for certain quality liqueur wines.

<doc id="11001" wikidata="Q183397" url="?curid=11001" title="Fred Hoyle">
<text>Sir Fred Hoyle (24 June 1915 – 20 August 2001) was an English astronomer who formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis and was one of the authors of the influential B2FH paper. He also held controversial stances on other scientific matters—in particular his rejection of the &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory (a term coined by him on BBC Radio) in favor of the &quot;steady-state model&quot;, and his promotion of panspermia as the origin of life on Earth. He spent most of his working life at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge and served as the founding director of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy at Cambridge.

Hoyle also wrote science fiction novels, short stories and radio plays, co-created television serials, and co-authored twelve books with his son, Geoffrey Hoyle.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hoyle was born near Bingley in Gilstead, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. His father Ben Hoyle was a violinist and worked in the wool trade in Bradford, and served as a machine gunner in the First World War. His mother, Mabel Pickard, had studied music at the Royal College of Music in London and later worked as a cinema pianist. Hoyle was educated at Bingley Grammar School and read mathematics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. As a youth, he sang in the choir at the local Anglican church.

In 1936, Hoyle shared the Mayhew Prize with George Stanley Rushbrooke.

===Career===
In late 1940, Hoyle left Cambridge to go to Portsmouth to work for the Admiralty on radar research, for example devising a method to get the altitude of incoming aeroplanes. He was also put in charge of countermeasures against the radar-guided guns found on the &quot;Graf Spee&quot; after its scuttling in the River Plate. Britain&#x27;s radar project was a large-scale operation, and was probably the inspiration for the large British project in Hoyle&#x27;s novel &quot;The Black Cloud&quot;. Two colleagues in this war work were Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold, and the three had many discussions on cosmology. The radar work involved several trips to North America, where he took the opportunity to visit astronomers. On one trip to the US, he learned about supernovae at Caltech and Mount Palomar and, in Canada, the nuclear physics of plutonium implosion and explosion, noticed some similarity between the two and started thinking about supernova nucleosynthesis. He had an intuition at the time &quot;I will make a name for myself if this works out&quot; (he published his prescient and groundbreaking paper in 1954). He also formed a group at Cambridge exploring stellar nucleosynthesis in ordinary stars and was bothered by the paucity of stellar carbon production in existing models. He noticed that one existing process would be made a billion times more productive if the carbon-12 nucleus had a resonance at 7.7 MeV, but nuclear physicists at the time omitted such an observed value. On another trip, he visited the nuclear physics group at Caltech, spent a few months of sabbatical there and persuaded them against their scepticism to find the Hoyle state in carbon-12, from which a full theory of stellar nucleosynthesis was developed, co-authored by Hoyle and members of the Caltech group.
In 1945, after the war ended, Hoyle returned to Cambridge University as a lecturer at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (where he had been a Fellow since 1939). Hoyle&#x27;s Cambridge years, 1945–1973, saw him rise to the top of world astrophysics theory, on the basis of a startling originality of ideas covering a wide range of topics. In 1958, Hoyle was appointed Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy in Cambridge University. In 1967, he became the founding director of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy (subsequently renamed the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge), where his innovative leadership quickly led to this institution becoming one of the premier groups in the world for theoretical astrophysics. In 1971, he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject &quot;Astronomical Instruments and their Construction&quot;. Hoyle was knighted in 1972.

Although the occupant of two distinguished offices, by 1972 Hoyle had become unhappy with his life in Cambridge. A dispute over election to a professorial chair led to Hoyle resigning as Plumian professor in 1972. The following year he also resigned the directorship of the institute. Explaining his actions, he later wrote: &quot;I do not see any sense in continuing to skirmish on a battlefield where I can never hope to win. The Cambridge system is effectively designed to prevent one ever establishing a directed policy - key decisions can be upset by ill-informed and politically motivated committees. To be effective in this system one must for ever be watching one&#x27;s colleagues, almost like a Robespierre spy system. If one does so, then of course little time is left for any real science.&quot;

After leaving Cambridge, Hoyle wrote several popular science and science fiction books, as well as presenting lectures around the world, partly to provide a means of support. Hoyle was still a member of the joint policy committee (since 1967), during the planning stage for the 150-inch Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales. He became chairman of the Anglo-Australian Telescope board in 1973, and presided at its inauguration in 1974 by Charles, Prince of Wales.

===Decline and death===

After his resignation from Cambridge, Hoyle moved to the Lake District and occupied his time with treks across the moors, writing books, visiting research centres around the world, and working on science ideas (that have been largely rejected). On 24 November 1997, while hiking across moorlands in west Yorkshire, near his childhood home in Gilstead, Hoyle fell into a steep ravine called Shipley Glen. He was located about 12 hours later by a party using search dogs. He was hospitalised for two months with a broken shoulder bone, and pneumonia and kidney problems, both resulting from hypothermia. Thereafter he entered a marked decline, suffering from memory and mental agility problems. In 2001, he suffered a series of strokes and died in Bournemouth on 20 August of that year.

==Views and contributions==
===Origin of nucleosynthesis===
Hoyle authored the first two research papers ever published on synthesis of chemical elements heavier than helium by stellar nuclear reactions. The first of these in 1946 showed that cores of stars will evolve to temperatures of billions of degrees, much hotter than temperatures considered for thermonuclear origin of stellar power in main-sequence stars. Hoyle showed that at such high temperatures the element iron can become much more abundant than other heavy elements owing to thermal equilibrium among nuclear particles, explaining the high natural abundance of iron. This idea would later be called the &quot;e&quot;Process. Hoyle&#x27;s second foundational nucleosynthesis publication, published in 1954, showed that the elements between carbon and iron cannot be synthesized by such equilibrium processes. He attributed those elements to specific nuclear fusion reactions between abundant constituents in concentric shells of evolved massive, pre-supernova stars. This startlingly modern picture is the accepted paradigm today for the supernova nucleosynthesis of these primary elements. In the mid-1950s, Hoyle became the leader of a group of talented experimental and theoretical physicists who met in Cambridge: William Alfred Fowler, Margaret Burbidge, and Geoffrey Burbidge. This group systematized basic ideas of how all the chemical elements in our universe were created, with this now being a field called nucleosynthesis. Famously, in 1957, this group produced the B2FH paper (known for the initials of the four authors) in which the field of nucleosynthesis was organized into complementary nuclear processes. They added much new material on the synthesis of heavy elements by neutron-capture reactions, the so-called s process and the r process. So influential did the B2FH paper become that for the remainder of the twentieth century it became the default citation of almost all researchers wishing to cite an accepted origin for nucleosynthesis theory, and as a result, the path-breaking Hoyle 1954 paper fell into obscurity. Historical research in the 21st century has brought Hoyle&#x27;s 1954 paper back to scientific prominence. Those historical arguments were first presented to a gathering of nucleosynthesis experts attending a 2007 conference at Caltech organized after the deaths of both Fowler and Hoyle to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the publication of B2FH. Ironically the B2FH paper did not review Hoyle&#x27;s 1954 supernova-shells attribution of the origin of elements between silicon and iron despite Hoyle&#x27;s co-authorship of B2FH. Based on his many personal discussions with Hoyle Donald D. Clayton has attributed this seemingly inexplicable oversight in B2FH to the lack of proofreading by Hoyle of the draft composed at Caltech in 1956 by G. R. Burbidge and E. M. Burbidge.

The second of Hoyle&#x27;s nucleosynthesis papers also introduced an interesting use of the anthropic principle, which was not then known by that name. In trying to work out the steps of stellar nucleosynthesis, Hoyle calculated that one particular nuclear reaction, the triple-alpha process, which generates carbon from helium, would require the carbon nucleus to have a very specific resonance energy and spin for it to work. The large amount of carbon in the universe, which makes it possible for carbon-based life-forms of any kind to exist, demonstrated to Hoyle that this nuclear reaction must work. Based on this notion, Hoyle therefore predicted the values of the energy, the nuclear spin and the parity of the compound state in the carbon nucleus formed by three alpha particles (helium nuclei), which was later borne out by experiment.

This energy level, while needed to produce carbon in large quantities, was statistically very unlikely to fall where it does in the scheme of carbon energy levels. Hoyle later wrote:

His co-worker William Alfred Fowler eventually won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1983 (with Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar), but Hoyle&#x27;s original contribution was overlooked by the electors, and many were surprised that such a notable astronomer missed out. Fowler himself in an autobiographical sketch affirmed Hoyle&#x27;s pioneering efforts:

===Rejection of the Big Bang===
While having no argument with the Lemaître theory (later confirmed by Edwin Hubble&#x27;s observations) that the universe was expanding, Hoyle disagreed on its interpretation. He found the idea that the universe had a beginning to be pseudoscience, resembling arguments for a creator, &quot;for it&#x27;s an irrational process, and can&#x27;t be described in scientific terms&quot; (see Kalam cosmological argument). Instead, Hoyle, along with Thomas Gold and Hermann Bondi (with whom he had worked on radar in the Second World War), in 1948 began to argue for the universe as being in a &quot;steady state&quot; and formulated their Steady State theory. The theory tried to explain how the universe could be eternal and essentially unchanging while still having the galaxies we observe moving away from each other. The theory hinged on the creation of matter between galaxies over time, so that even though galaxies get further apart, new ones that develop between them fill the space they leave. The resulting universe is in a &quot;steady state&quot; in the same manner that a flowing river is—the individual water molecules are moving away but the overall river remains the same.

The theory was one alternative to the Big Bang which, like the Big Bang, agreed with key observations of the day, namely Hubble&#x27;s red shift observations, and Hoyle was a strong critic of the Big Bang. He coined the term &quot;Big Bang&quot; on BBC radio&#x27;s &quot;Third Programme&quot; broadcast on 28 March 1949. It was said by George Gamow and his opponents that Hoyle intended to be pejorative, and the script from which he read aloud was interpreted by his opponents to be &quot;vain, one-sided, insulting, not worthy of the BBC&quot;. Hoyle explicitly denied that he was being insulting and said it was just a striking image meant to emphasize the difference between the two theories for the radio audience. In another BBC interview, he said, &quot;The reason why scientists like the &quot;Big Bang&quot; is because they are overshadowed by the Book of Genesis. It is deep within the psyche of most scientists to believe in the first page of Genesis&quot;.

Hoyle had a famously heated argument with Martin Ryle of the Cavendish Radio Astronomy Group about Hoyle&#x27;s steady state theory, which somewhat restricted collaboration between the Cavendish group and the Cambridge Institute of Astronomy during the 1960s.

Hoyle, unlike Gold and Bondi, offered an explanation for the appearance of new matter by postulating the existence of what he dubbed the &quot;creation field&quot;, or just the &quot;C-field&quot;, which had negative pressure in order to be consistent with the conservation of energy and drive the expansion of the universe. This C-field is the same as the later &quot;de Sitter solution&quot; for cosmic inflation, but the C-field model acts much slower than the de Sitter inflation model. They jointly argued that continuous creation was no more inexplicable than the appearance of the entire universe from nothing, although it had to be done on a regular basis. In the end, mounting observational evidence convinced most cosmologists that the steady-state model was incorrect and that the Big Bang theory agreed better with observations, although Hoyle continued to support and develop his theory. In 1993, in an attempt to explain some of the evidence against the steady-state theory, he presented a modified version called &quot;quasi-steady state cosmology&quot; (QSS), but the theory is not widely accepted.

The evidence that resulted in the Big Bang&#x27;s victory over the steady-state model included discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation in the 1960s, and the distribution of &quot;young galaxies&quot; and quasars throughout the Universe in the 1980s indicate a more consistent age estimate of the universe. Hoyle died in 2001 having never accepted the validity of the Big Bang theory.

===Theory of gravity===
Together with Narlikar, Hoyle developed a particle theory in the 1960s, the Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity. It made predictions that were roughly the same as Einstein&#x27;s general relativity, but it incorporated Mach&#x27;s Principle, which Einstein had tried but failed to incorporate in his theory. The Hoyle-Narlikar theory fails several tests, including consistency with the microwave background. It was motivated by their belief in the steady-state model of the universe.

===Rejection of Earth-based abiogenesis===
In his later years, Hoyle became a staunch critic of theories of abiogenesis to explain the origin of life on Earth. With Chandra Wickramasinghe, Hoyle promoted the hypothesis that the first life on Earth began in space, spreading through the universe via panspermia, and that evolution on Earth is influenced by a steady influx of viruses arriving via comets. His belief that comets had a significant percentage of organic compounds was well ahead of his time, as the dominant views in the 1970s and 1980s were that comets largely consisted of water-ice, and the presence of organic compounds was then highly controversial. Wickramasinghe wrote in 2003: &quot;In the highly polarized polemic between Darwinism and creationism, our position is unique. Although we do not align ourselves with either side, both sides treat us as opponents. Thus we are outsiders with an unusual perspective—and our suggestion for a way out of the crisis has not yet been considered.&quot;

Hoyle and Wickramasinghe advanced several instances where they say outbreaks of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the 1918 flu pandemic, and certain outbreaks of polio and mad cow disease. For the 1918 flu pandemic, they hypothesized that cometary dust brought the virus to Earth simultaneously at multiple locations—a view almost universally dismissed by experts on this pandemic. In 1982, Hoyle presented &quot;Evolution from Space&quot; for the Royal Institution&#x27;s Omni Lecture. After considering what he thought of as a very remote possibility of Earth-based abiogenesis he concluded:

Published in his 1982/1984 books &quot;Evolution from Space&quot; (co-authored with Chandra Wickramasinghe), Hoyle calculated that the chance of obtaining the required set of enzymes for even the simplest living cell without panspermia was one in 1040,000. Since the number of atoms in the known universe is infinitesimally tiny by comparison (1080), he argued that Earth as life&#x27;s place of origin could be ruled out. He claimed:

Though Hoyle declared himself an atheist, this apparent suggestion of a guiding hand led him to the conclusion that &quot;a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and ... there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature.&quot; He would go on to compare the random emergence of even the simplest cell without panspermia to the likelihood that &quot;a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein&quot; and to compare the chance of obtaining even a single functioning protein by chance combination of amino acids to a solar system full of blind men solving Rubik&#x27;s Cubes simultaneously. This is known as &quot;the junkyard tornado&quot;, or &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Fallacy&quot;. Those who advocate the intelligent design (ID) philosophy sometimes cite Hoyle&#x27;s work in this area to support the claim that the universe was fine tuned to allow intelligent life to be possible.

===Other opinions===
While Hoyle was well-regarded for his works on nucleosynthesis and science popularization, he held positions on a wide range of scientific issues that were in direct opposition to the prevailing theories of the scientific community. Paul Davies describes how he &quot;loved his maverick personality and contempt for orthodoxy&quot;, quoting Hoyle as saying &quot;I don&#x27;t care what they think&quot; about his theories on discrepant redshift, and &quot;it is better to be interesting and wrong than boring and right&quot;.

Hoyle often expressed anger against the labyrinthine and petty politics at Cambridge and frequently feuded with members and institutions of all levels of the British astronomy community, leading to his resignation from Cambridge in September 1971 over the way he thought Donald Lynden-Bell was chosen to replace retiring professor Roderick Oliver Redman behind his back. According to biographer Simon Mitton, Hoyle was crestfallen because he felt that his colleagues at Cambridge were unsupportive.

In addition to his views on steady state theory and panspermia, Hoyle also supported the following controversial hypotheses and speculations:
* The correlation of flu epidemics with the sunspot cycle, with epidemics occurring at the minimum of the cycle. The idea was that flu contagion was scattered in the interstellar medium and reached Earth only when the solar wind had minimum power.
* Two fossil &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; were man-made fakes.
* The theory of abiogenic petroleum, held by Hoyle and by Thomas Gold, where natural hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas) are explained as the result of deep carbon deposits, instead of fossilized organic material. This theory is dismissed by the mainstream petroleum geochemistry community.
* In his 1977 book &quot;On Stonehenge&quot;, Hoyle supported Gerald Hawkins&#x27;s proposal that the fifty-six Aubrey holes at Stonehenge were used as a system for neolithic Britons to predict eclipses, using them in the daily positioning of marker stones. Using the Aubrey holes for predicting lunar eclipses was originally proposed by Gerald Hawkins in his book of the subject &quot;Stonehenge Decoded&quot; (1965).

===Nobel Prize for Physics===
Hoyle was also at the centre of two unrelated controversies involving the politics for selecting recipients of the Nobel Prize for Physics. The first arose when the 1974 prize went in part to Antony Hewish for his leading role in the discovery of pulsars. Hoyle made an off-the-cuff remark to a reporter in Montreal that &quot;Yes, Jocelyn Bell was the actual discoverer, not Hewish, who was her supervisor, so she should have been included.&quot; This remark received widespread international coverage. Worried about being misunderstood, Hoyle carefully composed a letter of explanation to &quot;The Times&quot;.

The 1983 prize went in part to William Alfred Fowler &quot;for his theoretical and experimental studies of the nuclear reactions of importance in the formation of the chemical elements in the universe&quot; despite Hoyle having been the inventor of the theory of nucleosynthesis in the stars with two research papers published shortly after WWII. So some suspicion arose that Hoyle was denied the third share of this prize because of his earlier public disagreement with the 1974 award. British scientist Harry Kroto later said that the Nobel Prize is not just an award for a piece of work, but a recognition of a scientist&#x27;s overall reputation and Hoyle&#x27;s championing many disreputable and disproven ideas may have invalidated him. In his obituary, &quot;Nature&quot; editor and fellow Briton John Maddox called it &quot;shameful&quot; that Fowler had been rewarded with a Nobel prize and Hoyle had not.

==Media appearances==
Hoyle appeared in a series of radio talks on astronomy for the BBC in the 1950s; these were collected in the book &quot;The Nature of the Universe&quot;, and he went on to write a number of other popular science books.

In the play &quot;Sur la route de Montalcino&quot;, the character of Fred Hoyle confronts Georges Lemaître on a fictional journey to the Vatican in 1957.

Hoyle appeared in the 1973 short film &quot;Take the World From Another Point of View&quot;.

In the 2004 television movie &quot;Hawking&quot;, Fred Hoyle is played by Peter Firth. In the movie, Stephen Hawking (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) publicly confronts Hoyle at a Royal Society lecture in summer 1964, about a mistake he found in his latest publication.

===Science fiction===
Hoyle also wrote science fiction. In his first novel, &quot;The Black Cloud&quot;, most intelligent life in the universe takes the form of interstellar gas clouds; they are surprised to learn that intelligent life can also form on planets. He wrote a television series, &quot;A for Andromeda&quot;, which was also published as a novel. His play &quot;Rockets in Ursa Major&quot; had a professional production at the Mermaid Theatre in 1962.
