<text>Hayling Island is an island off the south coast of England, in the borough of Havant in the county of Hampshire, east of Portsmouth.

==History==

An Iron Age shrine in the north of Hayling Island, later developed into a Roman temple in the 1st century BC, was first recorded in Richard Scott&#x27;s &quot;Topographical and Historical Account of Hayling Island&quot; (1826). The site was dug between 1897 and 1907 and again from 1976 to 1978. The remains are now buried under farmland. The first coin credited to Commius that was found in an archaeological dig was found at the temple. This Commius was probably the son of the Commius mentioned by Julius Caesar, although it is possible the coin was issued by the same Commius.

Salt production was an industry on the island from the 11th century, and the Domesday Book records a saltpan on the island. This industry continued until the late 19th century.

The monks of Jumièges Abbey, Normandy, began to build Northwode Chapel about 1140; this became the site of the present St Peter&#x27;s Church, now the oldest surviving church on the island. St Peter&#x27;s three bells, cast in about 1350, are one of the oldest peals in England. St Mary&#x27;s Church is a standard design for the churches of its era, but the walls were built with a mortar of local shells and beach pebbles. The ancient yew tree in the churchyard is believed to be the oldest yew in the county, with a girth of some . Estimates of its age range from over a thousand to nearly two thousand years old.

The grave of Princess Catherine Yurievskaya (1878–1959), a daughter of Alexander II of Russia, who lived in North Hayling for many years, is in St Peter&#x27;s churchyard; and that of George Glas Sandeman, nephew of the founder of Sandeman Port and second head of that company, is prominent in the north-east part of St Mary&#x27;s graveyard.

In May 1944, the island was the location of a mock invasion during the military Exercise Fabius, rehearsing the preparations for D-Day.

In 1982, the English Court of Appeal recognised prior art by Peter Chilvers, who in 1958 as a 12-year-old boy on Hayling Island assembled his first board combined with a sail. It had all the elements of the modern windsurfer. The court found that later innovations were &quot;merely an obvious extension&quot; and upheld the defendant&#x27;s claim based on film footage. This court case set a significant precedent for patent law in the United Kingdom, in terms of Inventive step and non-obviousness. The case, Chilvers, Hayling, and a replica of Chilvers&#x27;s original board were featured on an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot; in 2009.

On 20 October 2013, at least one hundred properties on the island were damaged when it was hit by a tornado. No injuries were reported.

==Geography==
Hayling Island is a true island, surrounded by water. Looking at its north to south orientation, it is shaped like an inverted T, about long and wide. A road bridge connects its northern end to the mainland of England at Langstone. The Hayling Ferry is a small pedestrian ferry connecting to the Eastney area of the city of Portsmouth on the neighbouring Portsea Island. To the west is Langstone Harbour and to the east is Chichester Harbour.

The natural beach at Hayling was predominantly sandy, but in recent years it has been mechanically topped with shingle dredged from the bed of the Solent in an effort to reduce beach erosion and reduce the potential to flood low-lying land. At low tide, the East Winner sandbank is visible, extending a mile out to sea. The coastline in this area has substantially changed since Roman times: it is believed much land has been lost from the coasts of Hayling and Selsey by erosion and subsequent flooding.

==Climate==

As with the rest of the British Isles and Southern England, Hayling Island experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. Temperatures have never fallen into double figures below freezing, illustrating the relative warmth of the island – comparable to the far southwest of England and its neighbour, the Isle of Wight. Temperature extremes between 1960 and 2010 have ranged from during January 1963, up to during June 1976.

==Sport and leisure==
Hayling Island has a non-League football club, Hayling United F.C., which plays at Hayling Park.

Although largely residential, Hayling is also a holiday, windsurfing and sailing centre, the site where windsurfing was invented.

In summer 2010, the Hayling Island Sailing Club hosted the 2010 World Laser Standard Senior and Junior Championships (27 August – 5 September). The Senior championship was won by Australian Tom Slingsby, whilst Dane Thorbjoern Schierup won the Junior competition. Today it is home to many different types of sailing, including a growing Fireball fleet.

As a consequence of the island&#x27;s popularity for water activities, there are two lifeboat services: Hayling Island Lifeboat Station, run by the RNLI and Hayling Island Rescue Service, an independent service run by retired RNLI helmsman, Frank Dunster.

The island hosts one of the few active Real Tennis courts in the UK. Founded in 1911, Seacourt Tennis club is one of only a handful in the UK where it is possible to play every recognised racquet sport. The racquets court itself was opened by Sir Colin Cowdrey.

Seacourt Tennis Club also hosts a weekly fencing club featuring all ages, levels and weapons.
Hayling Golf Club has been voted in the top 100 golf courses in the UK. A traditional links course, although relatively short by modern standards, the strong prevailing south-westerly winds, fast greens, gorse bushes and traditional deep links bunkers make this a stern test for any golfer.
Funland, an amusement park situated at Beachlands, is open year-round, as is the Hayling Seaside Railway which runs from the funfair to Eastoke corner.

The Hayling Billy Trail is a former light rail right-of-way which has been converted to one of many footpaths on the island. The Ordnance Survey Explorer 120 map covers the area and the local tourist information office supplies leaflets of local interest walks.

The Station Theatre hosts a variety of plays staged by the Hayling Island Amateur Dramatics Society, Hayling Musical Society, musical events and films throughout the year.

The island has several churches of different denominations including three Anglican churches; St Peter&#x27;s at Northney, St Mary&#x27;s at Gable Head and the more recently built St Andrew&#x27;s in South Hayling.

==Transport==
Hayling Ferry links Portsmouth and Hayling Island. The ferry is busy in summer in good weather, bringing tourists and cyclists to Hayling. In winter, there was a significant reduction of use. The ferry service to and from Portsea Island was subsidised by the local authorities, leaving it under constant threat of closure due to limited resources. The ferry service ceased when the company running the ferry went into administration in March 2015. It was reopened in August 2016 by Baker Trayte Marine Ltd.

During the ferry&#x27;s closure, the only public connection between Hayling Island and the mainland was the single carriageway road linking Northney to Langstone Havant. In summer, in particular, this road can become very congested, rendering the journey between the bridge and South Hayling (the most populated area) anything from 30 minutes to an hour. A proposed Millennium project to create a new shared pedestrian and cycle bridge was unsuccessful.

A railway to the island was active in the 19th and 20th centuries. It opened on 17 July 1867, coinciding with the local races. Terrier steam locomotives pulled carriages along the Hayling Billy Line from Havant Station on the mainland to a station which was located at the northern end of Staunton Avenue, passing through Langstone where there was a Halt. The railway was popular with tourists throughout the summer, though it saw little service in winter, and at peak times ran up to 24 services per day. Despite its popularity, the line was marked for closure in the Beeching Report owing to the prohibitive cost of replacing Langstone Bridge, which connected the island to the mainland, estimated at up to £400,000 to repair. Services ended on 3 November 1963, and the bridge was demolished in 1966. The remaining railway buildings are a goods shed, which has now been converted into a theatre run by HIADS, and a station, opposite the Ship Inn over the bridge. A railway gatehouse, located opposite Mill Lane, was burned down on 15 November 2018; no other building is believed to survive.

A tourist attraction, the East Hayling Light Railway, is a gauge railway which runs for just over from Beachlands Station to Eastoke Corner with aspirations to extend the route to Ferry Point within the next few years.

The nearest railway station to Hayling Island is Havant, just on to the mainland off Hayling Island. Alternatively, Portsmouth &amp; Southsea is another railway station, used for connections to Bristol Temple Meads and Cardiff.

==Notable people==

==Hayling oysterbeds==
Oysters have been fished on the Hayling oysterbeds, at the northwest corner of the island, from as long ago as Roman times, documented in town records since 1615. The oysters were actively farmed between as early as 1819 until the 1970s. Oysters became a delicacy that was exported throughout the country under the classification of &quot;Emsworth Oysters&quot;. Large complexes consisting of several pens separated by a series of bund walls and sluice gates were built to contain the oysters at varying stages of growth. Although large sections of the walls have since collapsed into the harbour, much of shape and scale of the beds can still be seen today.

In 1996, the oyster beds on the north west coast of Hayling Island were restored by the Havant Borough Council, creating a wildlife haven which has become an important seabird breeding site. The Design Council awarded this project &#x27;Millennium Product&#x27; status for the renovation.
==Twinning==
Hayling Island started twinning with Gorron, France, in 1997, after many years of social exchanges between the two communities rather than the normal council-led route. Charters were signed and exchanged in 1998 and are now displayed in the library in Elm Grove. In recognition of the twinning Gorron appears on the welcome signs, there is also a &#x27;twinning&#x27; tree outside the library and a Gorron roundabout at Beachlands. Gorron has similar recognitions including the &#x27;Rue de Hayling Island&#x27; – previously Rue Victor Hugo.

==Paris to Hayling cycle ride==
The island is the home of the Hayling Charity Cycle Ride which organises an annual charity cycle ride most often from Hayling Island to Paris and back. This event, run entirely by local unpaid volunteers, was started in 1986 by local cyclist Peter McQuade and has been run every year since. Up to 2023 over £1,800,000 had been collected for more than 500 good causes. Entrants have come from 15 different countries on five continents. Based on their research the organisers believe it may be the oldest long distance charity ride in the world.

== Population ==
In the mid- to late 20th century, Hayling Island&#x27;s population was known to double during the summer months, due to a large influx of holiday makers and the associated tourism employees to accommodate. As domestic holidays have declined and Hayling&#x27;s prominence as a traditional English seaside resort have followed in parallel, the population only swells by approximately 20%–25% (English Tourist Board estimate, 2001).

<text>In functional analysis, the Hahn–Banach theorem is a central result that allows the extension of bounded linear functionals defined on a vector subspace of some vector space to the whole space. The theorem also shows that there are sufficient continuous linear functionals defined on every normed vector space in order to study the dual space. Another version of the Hahn–Banach theorem is known as the Hahn–Banach separation theorem or the hyperplane separation theorem, and has numerous uses in convex geometry.

==History==

The theorem is named for the mathematicians Hans Hahn and Stefan Banach, who proved it independently in the late 1920s. 
The special case of the theorem for the space formula_1 of continuous functions on an interval was proved earlier (in 1912) by Eduard Helly, and a more general extension theorem, the M. Riesz extension theorem, from which the Hahn–Banach theorem can be derived, was proved in 1923 by Marcel Riesz.

The first Hahn–Banach theorem was proved by Eduard Helly in 1912 who showed that certain linear functionals defined on a subspace of a certain type of normed space (formula_2) had an extension of the same norm. Helly did this through the technique of first proving that a one-dimensional extension exists (where the linear functional has its domain extended by one dimension) and then using induction. In 1927, Hahn defined general Banach spaces and used Helly&#x27;s technique to prove a norm-preserving version of Hahn–Banach theorem for Banach spaces (where a bounded linear functional on a subspace has a bounded linear extension of the same norm to the whole space). In 1929, Banach, who was unaware of Hahn&#x27;s result, generalized it by replacing the norm-preserving version with the dominated extension version that uses sublinear functions. Whereas Helly&#x27;s proof used mathematical induction, Hahn and Banach both used transfinite induction.

The Hahn–Banach theorem arose from attempts to solve infinite systems of linear equations. This is needed to solve problems such as the moment problem, whereby given all the potential moments of a function one must determine if a function having these moments exists, and, if so, find it in terms of those moments. Another such problem is the Fourier cosine series problem, whereby given all the potential Fourier cosine coefficients one must determine if a function having those coefficients exists, and, again, find it if so.

Riesz and Helly solved the problem for certain classes of spaces (such as formula_3 and formula_4) where they discovered that the existence of a solution was equivalent to the existence and continuity of certain linear functionals. In effect, they needed to solve the following problem: 

:() Given a collection formula_5 of bounded linear functionals on a normed space formula_6 and a collection of scalars formula_7 determine if there is an formula_8 such that formula_9 for all formula_10

If formula_6 happens to be a reflexive space then to solve the vector problem, it suffices to solve the following dual problem:

:(The functional problem) Given a collection formula_12 of vectors in a normed space formula_6 and a collection of scalars formula_7 determine if there is a bounded linear functional formula_15 on formula_6 such that formula_17 for all formula_10

Riesz went on to define formula_3 space (formula_20) in 1910 and the formula_21 spaces in 1913. While investigating these spaces he proved a special case of the Hahn–Banach theorem. Helly also proved a special case of the Hahn–Banach theorem in 1912. In 1910, Riesz solved the functional problem for some specific spaces and in 1912, Helly solved it for a more general class of spaces. It wasn&#x27;t until 1932 that Banach, in one of the first important applications of the Hahn–Banach theorem, solved the general functional problem. The following theorem states the general functional problem and characterizes its solution.

The Hahn–Banach theorem can be deduced from the above theorem. If formula_6 is reflexive then this theorem solves the vector problem.

==Hahn–Banach theorem==

A real-valued function formula_23 defined on a subset formula_24 of formula_6 is said to be a function formula_26 if formula_27 for every formula_28 
For this reason, the following version of the Hahn–Banach theorem is called . 

The theorem remains true if the requirements on formula_29 are relaxed to require only that formula_29 be a convex function:
formula_31 
A function formula_26 is convex and satisfies formula_33 if and only if formula_34 for all vectors formula_35 and all non-negative real formula_36 such that formula_37 Every sublinear function is a convex function. 
On the other hand, if formula_26 is convex with formula_39 then the function defined by formula_40 is positively homogeneous 
(because for all formula_41 and formula_42 one has formula_43), hence, being convex, it is sublinear. It is also bounded above by formula_44 and satisfies formula_45 for every linear functional formula_46 So the extension of the Hahn–Banach theorem to convex functionals does not have a much larger content than the classical one stated for sublinear functionals.

If formula_47 is linear then formula_48 if and only if formula_49 
which is the (equivalent) conclusion that some authors write instead of formula_46
It follows that if formula_26 is also , meaning that formula_52 holds for all formula_53 then formula_48 if and only formula_55 
Every norm is a seminorm and both are symmetric balanced sublinear functions. A sublinear function is a seminorm if and only if it is a balanced function. On a real vector space (although not on a complex vector space), a sublinear function is a seminorm if and only if it is symmetric. The identity function formula_56 on formula_57 is an example of a sublinear function that is not a seminorm. 

===For complex or real vector spaces===

The dominated extension theorem for real linear functionals implies the following alternative statement of the Hahn–Banach theorem that can be applied to linear functionals on real or complex vector spaces. 

The theorem remains true if the requirements on formula_29 are relaxed to require only that for all formula_35 and all scalars formula_60 and formula_61 satisfying formula_62
formula_63
This condition holds if and only if formula_29 is a convex and balanced function satisfying formula_65 or equivalently, if and only if it is convex, satisfies formula_65 and formula_67 for all formula_8 and all unit length scalars formula_69 

A complex-valued functional formula_70 is said to be if formula_71 for all formula_41 in the domain of formula_73 
With this terminology, the above statements of the Hahn–Banach theorem can be restated more succinctly:

:Hahn–Banach dominated extension theorem: If formula_26 is a seminorm defined on a real or complex vector space formula_75 then every dominated linear functional defined on a vector subspace of formula_6 has a dominated linear extension to all of formula_77 In the case where formula_6 is a real vector space and formula_26 is merely a convex or sublinear function, this conclusion will remain true if both instances of &quot;dominated&quot; (meaning formula_80) are weakened to instead mean &quot;dominated&quot; (meaning formula_48). 

Proof

The following observations allow the Hahn–Banach theorem for real vector spaces to be applied to (complex-valued) linear functionals on complex vector spaces.

Every linear functional formula_82 on a complex vector space is completely determined by its real part formula_83 through the formula 
formula_84
and moreover, if formula_85 is a norm on formula_6 then their dual norms are equal: formula_87 
In particular, a linear functional on formula_6 extends another one defined on formula_89 if and only if their real parts are equal on formula_24 (in other words, a linear functional formula_70 extends formula_15 if and only if formula_93 extends formula_94). 
The real part of a linear functional on formula_6 is always a (meaning that it is linear when formula_6 is considered as a real vector space) and if formula_97 is a real-linear functional on a complex vector space then formula_98 defines the unique linear functional on formula_6 whose real part is formula_100 

If formula_70 is a linear functional on a (complex or real) vector space formula_6 and if formula_26 is a seminorm then 
formula_104
Stated in simpler language, a linear functional is dominated by a seminorm formula_29 if and only if its real part is dominated above by formula_106 

The proof above shows that when formula_29 is a seminorm then there is a one-to-one correspondence between dominated linear extensions of formula_108 and dominated real-linear extensions of formula_109 the proof even gives a formula for explicitly constructing a linear extension of formula_15 from any given real-linear extension of its real part.

Continuity

A linear functional formula_70 on a topological vector space is continuous if and only if this is true of its real part formula_112 if the domain is a normed space then formula_113 (where one side is infinite if and only if the other side is infinite). 
Assume formula_6 is a topological vector space and formula_26 is sublinear function. 
If formula_29 is a continuous sublinear function that dominates a linear functional formula_70 then formula_70 is necessarily continuous. Moreover, a linear functional formula_70 is continuous if and only if its absolute value formula_120 (which is a seminorm that dominates formula_70) is continuous. In particular, a linear functional is continuous if and only if it is dominated by some continuous sublinear function.

===Proof===

The Hahn–Banach theorem for real vector spaces ultimately follows from Helly&#x27;s initial result for the special case where the linear functional is extended from formula_24 to a larger vector space in which formula_24 has codimension formula_124

This lemma remains true if formula_26 is merely a convex function instead of a sublinear function. 
Assume that formula_29 is convex, which means that formula_127 for all formula_128 and formula_129 Let formula_130 formula_131 and formula_132 be as in the lemma&#x27;s statement. Given any formula_133 and any positive real formula_134 the positive real numbers formula_135 and formula_136 sum to formula_137 so that the convexity of formula_29 on formula_6 guarantees
formula_140
and hence
formula_141
thus proving that formula_142 which after multiplying both sides by formula_143 becomes 
formula_144 
This implies that the values defined by 
formula_145 
are real numbers that satisfy formula_146 As in the above proof of the one–dimensional dominated extension theorem above, for any real formula_147 define formula_148 by formula_149 
It can be verified that if formula_150 then formula_151 where formula_152 follows from formula_153 when formula_154 (respectively, follows from formula_155 when formula_156).
formula_157
The lemma above is the key step in deducing the dominated extension theorem from Zorn&#x27;s lemma. 

When formula_24 has countable codimension, then using induction and the lemma completes the proof of the Hahn–Banach theorem. The standard proof of the general case uses Zorn&#x27;s lemma although the strictly weaker ultrafilter lemma (which is equivalent to the compactness theorem and to the Boolean prime ideal theorem) may be used instead. Hahn–Banach can also be proved using Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces (which is also equivalent to the ultrafilter lemma)

The Mizar project has completely formalized and automatically checked the proof of the Hahn–Banach theorem in the HAHNBAN file.

==Continuous extension theorem==

The Hahn–Banach theorem can be used to guarantee the existence of continuous linear extensions of continuous linear functionals.

In category-theoretic terms, the underlying field of the vector space is an injective object in the category of locally convex vector spaces.

On a normed (or seminormed) space, a linear extension formula_70 of a bounded linear functional formula_15 is said to be if it has the same dual norm as the original functional: formula_161
Because of this terminology, the second part of the above theorem is sometimes referred to as the &quot;norm-preserving&quot; version of the Hahn–Banach theorem. Explicitly:

===Proof of the continuous extension theorem===

The following observations allow the continuous extension theorem to be deduced from the Hahn–Banach theorem. 

The absolute value of a linear functional is always a seminorm. A linear functional formula_70 on a topological vector space formula_6 is continuous if and only if its absolute value formula_120 is continuous, which happens if and only if there exists a continuous seminorm formula_29 on formula_6 such that formula_80 on the domain of formula_73 
If formula_6 is a locally convex space then this statement remains true when the linear functional formula_70 is defined on a vector subspace of formula_77 

Proof for normed spaces

A linear functional formula_15 on a normed space is continuous if and only if it is bounded, which means that its dual norm 
formula_173
is finite, in which case formula_174 holds for every point formula_175 in its domain. 
Moreover, if formula_176 is such that formula_177 for all formula_175 in the functional&#x27;s domain, then necessarily formula_179
If formula_70 is a linear extension of a linear functional formula_15 then their dual norms always satisfy formula_182 

so that equality formula_183 is equivalent to formula_184 which holds if and only if formula_185 for every point formula_41 in the extension&#x27;s domain. 
This can be restated in terms of the function formula_187 defined by formula_188 which is always a seminorm:

:A linear extension of a bounded linear functional formula_15 is norm-preserving if and only if the extension is dominated by the seminorm formula_190

Applying the Hahn–Banach theorem to formula_15 with this seminorm formula_192 thus produces a dominated linear extension whose norm is (necessarily) equal to that of formula_193 which proves the theorem:

===Non-locally convex spaces===

The continuous extension theorem might fail if the topological vector space (TVS) formula_6 is not locally convex. For example, for formula_195 the Lebesgue space formula_3 is a complete metrizable TVS (an F-space) that is locally convex (in fact, its only convex open subsets are itself formula_3 and the empty set) and the only continuous linear functional on formula_3 is the constant formula_199 function . Since formula_3 is Hausdorff, every finite-dimensional vector subspace formula_201 is linearly homeomorphic to Euclidean space formula_202 or formula_203 (by F. Riesz&#x27;s theorem) and so every non-zero linear functional formula_15 on formula_24 is continuous but none has a continuous linear extension to all of formula_206 
However, it is possible for a TVS formula_6 to not be locally convex but nevertheless have enough continuous linear functionals that its continuous dual space formula_208 separates points; for such a TVS, a continuous linear functional defined on a vector subspace have a continuous linear extension to the whole space. 

If the TVS formula_6 is not locally convex then there might not exist any continuous seminorm formula_26 (not just on formula_24) that dominates formula_193 in which case the Hahn–Banach theorem can not be applied as it was in the above proof of the continuous extension theorem. 
However, the proof&#x27;s argument can be generalized to give a characterization of when a continuous linear functional has a continuous linear extension: If formula_6 is any TVS (not necessarily locally convex), then a continuous linear functional formula_15 defined on a vector subspace formula_24 has a continuous linear extension formula_70 to all of formula_6 if and only if there exists some continuous seminorm formula_29 on formula_6 that dominates formula_220 Specifically, if given a continuous linear extension formula_70 then formula_222 is a continuous seminorm on formula_6 that dominates formula_224 and conversely, if given a continuous seminorm formula_225 on formula_6 that dominates formula_15 then any dominated linear extension of formula_15 to formula_6 (the existence of which is guaranteed by the Hahn–Banach theorem) will be a continuous linear extension.

==Geometric Hahn–Banach (the Hahn–Banach separation theorems)==
The key element of the Hahn–Banach theorem is fundamentally a result about the separation of two convex sets: formula_230 and formula_231 This sort of argument appears widely in convex geometry, optimization theory, and economics. Lemmas to this end derived from the original Hahn–Banach theorem are known as the Hahn–Banach separation theorems. 
They are generalizations of the hyperplane separation theorem, which states that two disjoint nonempty convex subsets of a finite-dimensional space formula_232 can be separated by some , which is a fiber (level set) of the form formula_233 where formula_234 is a non-zero linear functional and formula_235 is a scalar. 

When the convex sets have additional properties, such as being open or compact for example, then the conclusion can be substantially strengthened:

Then following important corollary is known as the Geometric Hahn–Banach theorem or Mazur&#x27;s theorem (also known as Ascoli–Mazur theorem). It follows from the first bullet above and the convexity of formula_236 

Mazur&#x27;s theorem clarifies that vector subspaces (even those that are not closed) can be characterized by linear functionals. 

===Supporting hyperplanes===

Since points are trivially convex, geometric Hahn–Banach implies that functionals can detect the boundary of a set. In particular, let formula_6 be a real topological vector space and formula_238 be convex with formula_239 If formula_240 then there is a functional that is vanishing at formula_241 but supported on the interior of formula_242

Call a normed space formula_6 smooth if at each point formula_41 in its unit ball there exists a unique closed hyperplane to the unit ball at formula_245 Köthe showed in 1983 that a normed space is smooth at a point formula_41 if and only if the norm is Gateaux differentiable at that point.

===Balanced or disked neighborhoods===

Let formula_247 be a convex balanced neighborhood of the origin in a locally convex topological vector space formula_6 and suppose formula_8 is not an element of formula_250 Then there exists a continuous linear functional formula_15 on formula_6 such that
formula_253

==Applications==

The Hahn–Banach theorem is the first sign of an important philosophy in functional analysis: to understand a space, one should understand its continuous functionals.

For example, linear subspaces are characterized by functionals: if is a normed vector space with linear subspace (not necessarily closed) and if formula_254 is an element of not in the closure of , then there exists a continuous linear map formula_255 with formula_256 for all formula_257 formula_258 and formula_259 (To see this, note that formula_260 is a sublinear function.) Moreover, if formula_254 is an element of , then there exists a continuous linear map formula_255 such that formula_263 and formula_264 This implies that the natural injection formula_265 from a normed space into its double dual formula_266 is isometric.

That last result also suggests that the Hahn–Banach theorem can often be used to locate a &quot;nicer&quot; topology in which to work. For example, many results in functional analysis assume that a space is Hausdorff or locally convex. However, suppose is a topological vector space, not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex, but with a nonempty, proper, convex, open set . Then geometric Hahn–Banach implies that there is a hyperplane separating from any other point. In particular, there must exist a nonzero functional on — that is, the continuous dual space formula_208 is non-trivial. Considering with the weak topology induced by formula_268 then becomes locally convex; by the second bullet of geometric Hahn–Banach, the weak topology on this new space separates points. 
Thus with this weak topology becomes Hausdorff. This sometimes allows some results from locally convex topological vector spaces to be applied to non-Hausdorff and non-locally convex spaces.

===Partial differential equations===

The Hahn–Banach theorem is often useful when one wishes to apply the method of a priori estimates. Suppose that we wish to solve the linear differential equation formula_269 for formula_270 with formula_15 given in some Banach space . If we have control on the size of formula_272 in terms of formula_273 and we can think of formula_272 as a bounded linear functional on some suitable space of test functions formula_275 then we can view formula_15 as a linear functional by adjunction: formula_277 At first, this functional is only defined on the image of formula_278 but using the Hahn–Banach theorem, we can try to extend it to the entire codomain . The resulting functional is often defined to be a weak solution to the equation.

===Characterizing reflexive Banach spaces===

===Example from Fredholm theory===
To illustrate an actual application of the Hahn–Banach theorem, we will now prove a result that follows almost entirely from the Hahn–Banach theorem.

The above result may be used to show that every closed vector subspace of formula_279 is complemented because any such space is either finite dimensional or else TVS–isomorphic to formula_280

==Generalizations==

General template

There are now many other versions of the Hahn–Banach theorem. The general template for the various versions of the Hahn–Banach theorem presented in this article is as follows:

:formula_26 is a sublinear function (possibly a seminorm) on a vector space formula_75 formula_24 is a vector subspace of formula_6 (possibly closed), and formula_15 is a linear functional on formula_24 satisfying formula_287 on formula_24 (and possibly some other conditions). One then concludes that there exists a linear extension formula_70 of formula_15 to formula_6 such that formula_80 on formula_6 (possibly with additional properties).

===For seminorms===

So for example, suppose that formula_15 is a bounded linear functional defined on a vector subspace formula_24 of a normed space formula_75 so its the operator norm formula_297 is a non-negative real number. 
Then the linear functional&#x27;s absolute value formula_298 is a seminorm on formula_24 and the map formula_300 defined by formula_301 is a seminorm on formula_6 that satisfies formula_303 on formula_236 
The Hahn–Banach theorem for seminorms guarantees the existence of a seminorm formula_305 that is equal to formula_306 on formula_24 (since formula_308) and is bounded above by formula_309 everywhere on formula_6 (since formula_311).

===Geometric separation===

===Maximal dominated linear extension===

If formula_312 is a singleton set (where formula_313 is some vector) and if formula_47 is such a maximal dominated linear extension of formula_131 then formula_316

===Vector valued Hahn–Banach===


===Invariant Hahn–Banach===
A set formula_317 of maps formula_318 is (with respect to function composition formula_319) if formula_320 for all formula_321 
Say that a function formula_15 defined on a subset formula_24 of formula_6 is if formula_325 and formula_326 on formula_24 for every formula_328

This theorem may be summarized:

:Every formula_317-invariant continuous linear functional defined on a vector subspace of a normed space formula_6 has a formula_317-invariant Hahn–Banach extension to all of formula_77

===For nonlinear functions===
The following theorem of Mazur–Orlicz (1953) is equivalent to the Hahn–Banach theorem.

The following theorem characterizes when scalar function on formula_6 (not necessarily linear) has a continuous linear extension to all of formula_77

==Converse==
Let be a topological vector space. A vector subspace of has the extension property if any continuous linear functional on can be extended to a continuous linear functional on , and we say that has the Hahn–Banach extension property (HBEP) if every vector subspace of has the extension property.

The Hahn–Banach theorem guarantees that every Hausdorff locally convex space has the HBEP. For complete metrizable topological vector spaces there is a converse, due to Kalton: every complete metrizable TVS with the Hahn–Banach extension property is locally convex. On the other hand, a vector space of uncountable dimension, endowed with the finest vector topology, then this is a topological vector spaces with the Hahn–Banach extension property that is neither locally convex nor metrizable.

A vector subspace of a TVS has the separation property if for every element of such that formula_335 there exists a continuous linear functional formula_15 on such that formula_337 and formula_256 for all formula_28 Clearly, the continuous dual space of a TVS separates points on if and only if formula_340 has the separation property. In 1992, Kakol proved that any infinite dimensional vector space , there exist TVS-topologies on that do not have the HBEP despite having enough continuous linear functionals for the continuous dual space to separate points on . However, if is a TVS then vector subspace of has the extension property if and only if vector subspace of has the separation property.

==Relation to axiom of choice and other theorems==
The proof of the Hahn–Banach theorem for real vector spaces (HB) commonly uses Zorn&#x27;s lemma, which in the axiomatic framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) is equivalent to the axiom of choice (AC). It was discovered by Łoś and Ryll-Nardzewski and independently by Luxemburg that HB can be proved using the ultrafilter lemma (UL), which is equivalent (under ZF) to the Boolean prime ideal theorem (BPI). BPI is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice and it was later shown that HB is strictly weaker than BPI.

The ultrafilter lemma is equivalent (under ZF) to the Banach–Alaoglu theorem, which is another foundational theorem in functional analysis. Although the Banach–Alaoglu theorem implies HB, it is not equivalent to it (said differently, the Banach–Alaoglu theorem is strictly stronger than HB). 
However, HB is equivalent to a certain weakened version of the Banach–Alaoglu theorem for normed spaces. 
The Hahn–Banach theorem is also equivalent to the following statement:

:(∗): On every Boolean algebra there exists a &quot;probability charge&quot;, that is: a non-constant finitely additive map from formula_341 into formula_342

(BPI is equivalent to the statement that there are always non-constant probability charges which take only the values 0 and 1.)

In ZF, the Hahn–Banach theorem suffices to derive the existence of a non-Lebesgue measurable set. Moreover, the Hahn–Banach theorem implies the Banach–Tarski paradox.

For separable Banach spaces, D. K. Brown and S. G. Simpson proved that the Hahn–Banach theorem follows from WKL0, a weak subsystem of second-order arithmetic that takes a form of Kőnig&#x27;s lemma restricted to binary trees as an axiom. In fact, they prove that under a weak set of assumptions, the two are equivalent, an example of reverse mathematics.

<text>Hampshire (, ; abbreviated to Hants.) is a ceremonial county in South East England. It is bordered by Berkshire to the north, Surrey and West Sussex to the east, the Isle of Wight across the Solent to the south, Dorset to the west, and Wiltshire to the north-west. The city of Southampton is the largest settlement.

The county has an area of and a population of 1,844,245, making it the 5th-most populous in England. The South Hampshire built-up area in the south-east of the county has a population of 855,569 and contains the cities of Southampton (269,781) and Portsmouth (208,100). In the north-east, the Farnborough/Aldershot conurbation extends into Berkshire and Surrey and has a population of 252,937. The next-largest settlements are Basingstoke (113,776), Andover (50,887), and Winchester (45,184). The centre and south-west of the county are rural. For local government purposes Hampshire comprises a non-metropolitan county, with eleven districts, and two unitary authority areas: Portsmouth and Southampton. The county historically contained the towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch, which are now part of Dorset, and the Isle of Wight.

Undulating hills characterise much of the county. A belt of chalk crosses the county from north-west, where it forms the Hampshire Downs, to south-east, where it is part of the South Downs. The county&#x27;s major rivers rise in these hills; the Loddon and Wey drain north, into the Thames, and the Itchen and Test flow south into Southampton Water, a large estuary. In the south-east are Portsmouth Harbour, Langstone Harbour, and the western edge of Chichester Harbour, three large rias. The south-west contains the New Forest, which includes pasture, heath, and forest and is of the largest expanses of ancient woodland remaining in England.

Settled about 14,000 years ago, Hampshire&#x27;s recorded history dates to Roman Britain, when its chief town was Venta Belgarum (now Winchester). The county was recorded in Domesday Book as divided into 44 hundreds. From the 12th century, the ports settlements grew due to increasing trade with the European mainland resulting from the wool and cloth, fishing, and shipbuilding industries. This meant by the 16th century, Southampton had become more populous than Winchester. In 20th century conflicts, including World War One and Two, Hampshire played a crucial military role due to its ports.

==Toponymy==
The Saxon settlement at Southampton was known as , while the surrounding area or was called . The old name was recorded in the Domesday book as , and it is from this spelling that the modern abbreviation &quot;Hants&quot; derives. From 1889 until 1959, the administrative county was named the County of Southampton. It has also been called Southamptonshire.

Hampshire was a departure point for several groups of colonists who left England to settle on the east coast of North America during the 17th century, and many inhabitants of Hampshire settled there, naming the land New Hampshire in honour of their original homeland.

==History==

===Before the Roman Conquest===

The region is believed to have been continuously occupied since the end of the last Ice Age about 12,000 BCE. At that time sea levels were lower and Britain was still attached by a land bridge to the European continent and predominantly covered with deciduous woodland. The first inhabitants were Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. The majority of the population would have been concentrated around the river valleys. Over several thousand years the climate became progressively warmer and sea levels rose; the English Channel, which started out as a river, was a major inlet by 8000 BCE, although Britain was still connected to Europe by a land bridge across the North Sea until 6500 BCE. Notable sites from this period include Bouldnor Cliff.
Agriculture was being practised in southern Britain by 4000 BCE and with it a neolithic culture. Some deforestation took place at that time, although during the Bronze Age, beginning in 2200 BCE, it became more widespread and systematic. Hampshire has few monuments to show from those early periods, although nearby Stonehenge was built in several phases at some time between 3100 and 2200 BCE. In the very late Bronze Age fortified hilltop settlements known as hillforts began to appear in large numbers in many parts of Britain including Hampshire, and they became more and more important in the early and middle Iron Age; many of them are still visible in the landscape today and can be visited, notably Danebury Rings, the subject of a major study by archaeologist Barry Cunliffe. By that period the people of Britain predominantly spoke a Celtic language, and their culture shared much in common with the Celts described by classical writers. The town of Bitterne (&quot;Byterne&quot; in a reference from the late 11th century.) shares the same root as the River Erne, suggesting the name refers to the Iverni.

Hillforts largely declined in importance in the second half of the second century BCE, with many being abandoned. Probably around that period the first recorded invasion of Britain took place, as southern Britain was largely conquered by warrior-elites from Belgic tribes of northeastern Gaul, but whether those two events were linked to the decline of hillforts is unknown. By the time of the Roman conquest the &quot;oppidum&quot; at Venta Belgarum, modern-day Winchester, was the &quot;de facto&quot; regional administrative centre; Winchester was, however, of secondary importance to the Roman-style town of Calleva Atrebatum, modern Silchester, built further north by a dominant Belgic polity known as the Atrebates in the 50s BCE. Julius Caesar invaded south-eastern England briefly in 55 and again in 54 BCE, but he never reached Hampshire. Notable sites from this period include Hengistbury Head (now in Dorset), which was a major port.

===The Roman Era===

The Romans invaded Britain again in 43 CE and Hampshire was incorporated into the Roman province of Britannia very quickly. It is generally believed their political leaders allowed themselves to be incorporated peacefully. Venta became the capital of the administrative polity of the Belgae, which included most of Hampshire and Wiltshire and reached as far as Bath. Whether the people of Hampshire played any role in Boudicca&#x27;s rebellion of 60–61 is not recorded, but evidence of burning is seen in Winchester dated to around that period. For most of the next three centuries southern Britain enjoyed relative peace. During the later part of the Roman period most towns built defensive walls; a pottery industry based in the New Forest exported items widely across southern Britain. A fortification near Southampton was called Clausentum, part of the Saxon Shore forts, traditionally seen as either defences against maritime raids by Germanic tribes, or as a settlement area of Germanic tribes, which receives support from archaeological finds. Artefacts of a Germanic style have been found in burials, while there is also evidence of the presence of early Saxon settlement in southern England and the northern coasts of Gaul around Boulogne-sur-Mer and Bayeux. This, in turn, could mirror a well documented practice of deliberately settling Germanic tribes to strengthen Roman defences.
Portus Adurni was a Roman fort situated at the north end of Portsmouth Harbour. It was part of the Saxon Shore, and is the best-preserved Roman fort north of the Alps. Around an eighth of the fort has been excavated. A Norman keep was added in the Middle Ages, now known as Portchester Castle. The Romans withdrew from Britain in 410.
Two major Roman roads, Ermin Way and Port Way, cross the north of the county connecting Calleva Atrebatum with Corinium Dobunnorum, modern Cirencester, and Old Sarum respectively. Other roads connected Venta Belgarum with Old Sarum, Wickham and Clausentum. A road presumed to diverge from the Chichester to Silchester Way at Wickham connected Noviomagus Reginorum, modern Chichester, with Clausentum.

===The Jutes===

Records are sparse for the next 300 years, but later chroniclers speak of an influx of Jutes – an amalgam of Cimbri, Teutons, Gutones and Charudes called &quot;Eudoses&quot;, &quot;Eotenas&quot;, &quot;Iutae&quot; or &quot;Euthiones&quot; in other sources - and recorded by Bede in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People in the early eighth century:
They initially settled Hampshire under Visigothic authority sometime after 476 AD, forming several distinct folklands organized around a central geographical feature. Various place-names identify locations as Jutish, including Bishopstoke (&quot;Ytingstoc&quot;), the River Itchen (&quot;Ytene&quot;) and the Meon Valley (&quot;Ytedene&quot;). There in fact appear to be at least two Jutish folklands in Hampshire: one established along the River Itchen and one along the River Meon. Evidence of an early Germanic settlement has been found at Clausentum, dated to the fifth century and likely the Visigothic center of power in the area, either independently or in conjunction with powerful Romano-British trading ports. Nevertheless, Visigothic authority waned after 517 A.D and the settlements were gradually encroached upon by South Saxons.

===The Saxons===

The West Saxons moved south in the late seventh century and incorporated Hampshire into their kingdom. Around this period, the administrative region of &quot;Hampshire&quot; seems to appear - the name is attested as Hamwic and &quot;Hamtunscir&quot; in 755 AD - and suggests that control over the Solent was the motivating factor for establishment of the settlement.

Wessex, with its capital at Winchester, gradually expanded westwards into Brythonic Dorset and Somerset. A statue in Winchester celebrates the powerful King Alfred, who repulsed the Vikings and stabilised the region in the 9th century. A scholar as well as a soldier, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a powerful tool in the development of the English identity, was commissioned in his reign. King Alfred proclaimed himself &quot;King of England&quot; in 886 AD; but Athelstan of Wessex did not officially control the whole of England until 927 AD.

===Middle Ages onwards===

By the Norman conquest, London had overtaken Winchester as the largest city in England and after the Norman Conquest, King William I made London his capital. While the centre of political power moved away from Hampshire, Winchester remained an important city; the proximity of the New Forest to Winchester made it a prized royal hunting forest; King William Rufus was killed while hunting there in 1100. There were 44 hundreds, covering 483 named places, recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 which are in present-day Hampshire and part of Sussex. From the 12th century, the ports grew in importance, fuelled by trade with the continent, wool and cloth manufacture in the county, and the fishing industry, and a shipbuilding industry was established. By 1523 at the latest, the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester.
Over several centuries, a series of castles and forts was constructed along the coast of the Solent to defend the harbours at Southampton and Portsmouth. These include the Roman Portchester Castle which overlooks Portsmouth Harbour, and a series of forts built by Henry VIII including Hurst Castle, situated on a sand spit at the mouth of the Solent, Calshot Castle on another spit at the mouth of Southampton Water, and Netley Castle. Southampton and Portsmouth remained important harbours when rivals, such as Poole and Bristol, declined, as they are amongst the few locations that combine shelter with deep water. &quot;Mayflower&quot; and &quot;Speedwell&quot; set sail for America from Southampton in 1620.

During the English Civil War (1642–1651) there were several skirmishes in Hampshire between the Royalist and Parliamentarian forces. Principal engagements were the Siege of Basing House between 1643 and 1645, and the Battle of Cheriton in 1644; both were significant Parliamentarian victories. Other clashes included the Battle of Alton in 1643, where the commander of the Royalist forces was killed in the pulpit of the parish church, and the Siege of Portsmouth in 1642.

By the mid-19th century, with the county&#x27;s population at 219,210 (double that at the beginning of the century) in more than 86,000 dwellings, agriculture was the principal industry (10 per cent of the county was still forest) with cereals, peas, hops, honey, sheep and hogs important. Due to Hampshire&#x27;s long association with pigs and boars, natives of the county have been known as &quot;Hampshire hogs&quot; since the 18th century. In the eastern part of the county the principal port was Portsmouth (with its naval base, population 95,000), while several ports (including Southampton, with its steam docks, population 47,000) in the western part were significant. In 1868, the number of people employed in manufacture exceeded those in agriculture, engaged in silk, paper, sugar and lace industries, ship building and salt works. Coastal towns engaged in fishing and exporting agricultural produce. Several places were popular for seasonal sea bathing. The ports employed large numbers of workers, both land-based and seagoing; &quot;Titanic&quot;, lost on her maiden voyage in 1912, was crewed largely by residents of Southampton.

On 16 October 1908, Samuel Franklin Cody made the first powered flight of in the United Kingdom at Farnborough, then home to the Army Balloon Factory.

===Modern era===
Hampshire played a crucial role in both World Wars due to the large Royal Navy naval base at Portsmouth, the army camp at Aldershot, and the military Netley Hospital on Southampton Water, as well as its proximity to the army training ranges on Salisbury Plain and the Isle of Purbeck. Supermarine, the designers of the Spitfire and other military aircraft, were based in Southampton, which led to severe bombing of the city in World War II. Aldershot remains one of the British Army&#x27;s main permanent camps. Farnborough is a major centre for the aviation industry.

During World War II, the Beaulieu estate of Lord Montagu in the New Forest was the site of several group B finishing schools for agents operated by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) between 1941 and 1945. (One of the trainers was Kim Philby who was later found to be part of a spy ring passing information to the Soviets.) In 2005, a special exhibition was established at the Estate, with a video showing photographs from that era as well as voice recordings of former SOE trainers and agents.

Although the Isle of Wight has at times been part of Hampshire, it has been administratively independent for over a century, obtaining a county council of its own in 1890. The Isle of Wight became a full ceremonial county in 1974. Apart from a shared police force, no formal administrative links now exist between the Isle of Wight and Hampshire, though many organisations still combine Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

In the 1970s, local government reorganisation led to a reduction in Hampshire&#x27;s size; in 1974, the towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch were transferred to Dorset.

==Geography==
Hampshire is bordered by Dorset to the west, Wiltshire to the north-west, Berkshire to the north, Surrey to the north-east, and West Sussex to the east. The southern boundary is the coastline of the English Channel and the Solent, facing the Isle of Wight. It is the largest county in South East England and remains the third largest shire county in the United Kingdom despite losing more land than any other English county in all contemporary boundary changes. At its greatest size in 1890, Hampshire was the fifth-largest county in England. It now has an overall area of , and measures about east–west and north–south.

===Geology===

Hampshire&#x27;s geology falls into two categories. The north and centre are the county&#x27;s downlands: a gently folded succession of sedimentary rocks dating from the Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods. The lower (early) Cretaceous rocks are sandstones and mudstones whilst those of the upper (late) Cretaceous are the various formations that comprise the Chalk Group. Overlying these rocks in some areas are less consolidated Palaeogene clays, sands, gravels and silts of the Lambeth, Thames and Bracklesham Groups.

In the south, along the coast is the &quot;Hampshire Basin&quot;, an area of relatively non-resistant Eocene and Oligocene clays and gravels which are protected from sea erosion by the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, and the Isle of Wight. These low, flat lands support heathland and woodland habitats, a large area of which forms part of the New Forest. The New Forest has a mosaic of heathland, grassland, coniferous and deciduous woodland habitats that host diverse wildlife. The forest is protected as a national park, limiting development and agricultural use to protect the landscape and wildlife. Large areas of the New Forest are open common lands kept as a grassland plagioclimax by grazing animals, including domesticated cattle, pigs and horses, and several wild deer species. Erosion of the weak rock and sea level change flooding the low land has carved several large estuaries and rias, notably the long Southampton Water and the large convoluted Portsmouth Harbour. The Isle of Wight lies off the coast of Hampshire where the non-resistant rock has been eroded away, forming the Solent.

A 2014 study found that Hampshire shares significant reserves of shale oil with other neighbouring counties, totalling 4.4 billion barrels of oil, which then Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said &quot;will bring jobs and business opportunities&quot; and significantly help with UK energy self-sufficiency. Fracking in the area is required to achieve these objectives, which has been opposed by environmental groups.

===Natural regions===
Natural England identifies a number of national character areas that lie wholly or partially in Hampshire: the Hampshire Downs, New Forest, South Hampshire Lowlands, South Coast Plain, South Downs, Low Weald and Thames Basin Heaths

===Green belt===


Hampshire contains all its green belt in the New Forest district, in the southwest of the county, from the boundary with Dorset along the coastline to Lymington and northwards to Ringwood. Its boundary is contiguous with the New Forest National Park. The Hampshire portion was first created in 1958. Its function is to control expansion in the South East Dorset conurbation and outlying towns and villages.

===Hills===
The highest point in Hampshire is Pilot Hill at , in the northwest corner of the county, bordering Berkshire, and there are some 20 other hills exceeding . Butser Hill, at , where the A3 crosses the South Downs, is probably the best known. In the north and centre of the county the substrate is the rocks of the Chalk Group, which form the Hampshire Downs and the South Downs. These are high hills with steep slopes where they border the clays to the south. The hills dip steeply forming a scarp onto the Thames valley to the north, and dip gently to the south. The highest village in Hampshire at about above sea level is Ashmansworth, located between Andover and Newbury.

===Rivers===
The Itchen and Test are trout rivers that flow from the chalk through wooded valleys into Southampton Water. Other important watercourses are the Hamble, Meon, Beaulieu and Lymington rivers. The Hampshire Avon, which links Stonehenge to the sea, passes through Fordingbridge and Ringwood and then forms the modern border between Hampshire and Dorset. The northern branch of the River Wey has its source near Alton and flows east past Bentley. The River Loddon rises at West Ham Farm and flows north through Basingstoke.

===Wildlife===

Hampshire&#x27;s downland supports a calcareous grassland habitat, important for wild flowers and insects. A large area of the downs is now protected from further agricultural damage by the East Hampshire Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The River Test has a growing number of otters as, increasingly, does the Itchen, although other areas of the county have quite low numbers. There are wild boar kept for meat in the New Forest, which is known for its ponies and herds of fallow deer, red deer, roe deer, and sika deer as well as a small number of muntjac deer. The deer had been hunted for some 900 years until 1997. An unwelcome relative newcomer is the mink population, descended from animals that escaped or were deliberately released from fur farms since the 1950s, which cause havoc amongst native wildlife.

Farlington Marshes, of flower-rich grazing marsh and saline lagoon at the north end of Langstone Harbour, is a nature reserve and an internationally important overwintering site for wildfowl. In a valley on the downs is Selborne; the countryside surrounding the village was the location of Gilbert White&#x27;s pioneering observations on natural history. Hampshire&#x27;s county flower is the Dog Rose.

Hampshire contains two national parks; the New Forest is wholly within the county, and the South Downs National Park embraces parts of Hampshire, West Sussex and East Sussex; they are each overseen by a national park authority.

===Climate===
Hampshire has a milder climate than most areas of the British Isles, being in the far south with the climate stabilising effect of the sea, but protected against the more extreme weather of the Atlantic coast. Hampshire has a higher average annual temperature than the UK average at , average rainfall at per year, and holds higher than average sunshine totals of around 1,750 hours of sunshine per year.


==Settlements==

&quot;For the complete list of settlements see List of places in Hampshire and List of settlements in Hampshire by population.&quot;

Hampshire&#x27;s county town is Winchester, a historic city that was once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Wessex and of England until the Norman conquest of England. The port cities of Southampton and Portsmouth were split off as independent unitary authorities in 1997, although they are still included in Hampshire for ceremonial purposes. Fareham, Gosport and Havant have grown into a conurbation that stretches along the coast between the two main cities. The three cities are all university cities, Southampton being home to the University of Southampton and Southampton Solent University (formerly Southampton Institute), Portsmouth to the University of Portsmouth, and Winchester to the University of Winchester (formerly known as University College Winchester; King Alfred&#x27;s College). The northeast of the county houses the Blackwater Valley conurbation, which includes the towns of Farnborough, Aldershot, Blackwater and Yateley and borders both Berkshire and Surrey.

Hampshire lies outside the green belt area of restricted development around London, but has good railway and motorway links to the capital, and in common with the rest of the south-east has seen the growth of dormitory towns since the 1960s. Basingstoke, in the northern part of the county, has grown from a country town into a business and financial centre. Aldershot, Portsmouth, and Farnborough have strong military associations with the Army, Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force respectively. The county also includes several market towns: Alresford, Alton, Andover, Bishop&#x27;s Waltham, Lymington, New Milton, Petersfield, Ringwood, Romsey and Whitchurch.

==Demographics==
===Population===
At the 2001 census the ceremonial county recorded a population of 1,644,249, of which 1,240,103 were in the administrative county, 217,445 were in the unitary authority of Southampton, and 186,701 were in Portsmouth. The population of the administrative county grew 5.6 per cent from the 1991 census and Southampton grew 6.2 per cent (Portsmouth remained unchanged), compared with 2.6 per cent for England and Wales as a whole. Eastleigh and Winchester grew fastest at 9 per cent each.

Southampton and Portsmouth are the main settlements within the South Hampshire conurbation, which is home to about half of the ceremonial county&#x27;s population. The larger South Hampshire metropolitan area has a population of 1,547,000.

Cities and towns by population size: (2001 census)
*Southampton – 244,224
*Portsmouth – 207,100
*Basingstoke – 90,171 (town), 152,573 (borough)
*Gosport – 69,348 (town), 77,000 (borough)
*Andover – 64,000

*Havant – 45,435 (town), 115,300 (borough)
*Winchester – 41,420 (city), 116,600 (district)
*Fleet – 32,726
*Petersfield-14,974 (town)

The table below shows the population change up to the 2011 census, contrasting the previous census. It also shows the proportion of residents in each district reliant upon lowest income and/or joblessness benefits, the national average proportion of which was 4.5 per cent (August 2012). The most populous district of Hampshire is New Forest District.
===Ethnicity and religion===
At the 2011 census, about 89 per cent of residents were white British, falling to 85.87 per cent in Southampton. The significant ethnic minorities were Asian at 2.6 per cent and mixed race at 1.4 per cent; 10 per cent of residents were born outside the UK. 59.7 per cent stated their religion as Christian and 29.5 per cent as not religious. Significant minority religions were Islam (1.46 per cent) and Hinduism (0.73 per cent).

The Church of England Diocese of Winchester was founded in 676AD and covers about two thirds of Hampshire and extends into Dorset. Smaller parts of Hampshire are covered by the dioceses of Portsmouth, Guildford and Oxford.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth covers Hampshire as well as the Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands.

==Politics==
With the exceptions of the unitary authorities of Portsmouth and Southampton, Hampshire is governed by Hampshire County Council based at Castle Hill in Winchester, with eleven non-metropolitan districts beneath it and, for the majority of the county, parish councils or town councils at the local level.

In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, nearly 55% of Hampshire (including the Isle of Wight) voted in favour of Brexit. Gosport was the area that voted to Leave with the highest majority (64%), while Winchester was the area that voted to Remain with the highest majority (59%). Hart and East Hampshire also voted to Remain.

Under the English Devolution Bill, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight entered the Devolution Priority Programme which may lead to a new combined authority covering Hampshire, Southampton, Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight and an elected mayor in the spring of 2026. As part of the move, Hampshire County Council and the district councils within its area would be abolished.

===Parliament===

Hampshire elects eighteen Members of Parliament. As of the 2019 General Election, sixteen MPs are Conservative and two MPs are Labour.
In the 2019 General Election there were no seat changes, with the 16 Conservative constituencies and 2 Labour constituencies holding on to the same seats won or held in 2017. This is despite the Liberal Democrats gaining 57,876 more votes (an increase of 50.4%) compared to 2017, and Labour losing 72,278 votes (29.9%) compared to 2017.

At the 2017 General Election, the Conservatives won 16 seats, continuing their dominance in the county. Labour took two seats, Southampton Test and Portsmouth South.
In the 2015 general election, every Hampshire seat except Southampton Test (Labour) was won by the Conservatives.
In 2010, 14 constituencies were represented by Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs), two by the Liberal Democrats, and two by Labour. Labour represented the largest urban centre, holding both Southampton constituencies (Test and Itchen). The Liberal Democrats held Portsmouth South and Eastleigh.

The Conservatives represent a mix of rural and urban areas: Aldershot, Basingstoke, East Hampshire, Fareham, Gosport, Havant, Meon Valley, North East Hampshire, North West Hampshire, New Forest East, New Forest West, Portsmouth North, Romsey and Southampton North and Winchester.

At the 2013 local elections for Hampshire County Council, the Conservative Party had a 37.51 per cent share of the votes, the Liberal Democrats 21.71 per cent, the UK Independence Party 24.61 per cent and Labour 10 per cent. As a result, 45 Conservatives, 17 Liberal Democrats, 10 UKIP, four Labour and one Community Campaign councillor sit on the County Council. Southampton City Council, which is a separate Unitary Authority, has 28 Labour, 16 Conservative, 2 Councillors Against the Cuts and 2 Liberal Democrat councillors. Portsmouth City Council, also a UA, has 25 Liberal Democrat, 12 Conservative and 5 Labour councillors.

Hampshire has its own County Youth Council (HCYC) and is an independent youth-run organisation. It meets once a month around Hampshire and aims to give the young people of Hampshire a voice. It also has numerous district and borough youth councils including Basingstoke&#x27;s &quot;Basingstoke &amp; Deane Youth Council&quot;.

==Emergency services==
*Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service
*South Central Ambulance Service
*South East Coast Ambulance Service
*Hampshire &amp; Isle of Wight Air Ambulance
*Hampshire Constabulary
*British Transport Police
*HM Coastguard

==Economy==

Hampshire is one of the most affluent counties in the country, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of £29 billion, excluding Southampton and Portsmouth. In 2018, Hampshire had a GDP per capita of £22,100, comparable with the UK as a whole.

Portsmouth and Winchester have the highest job densities in the county; 38 per cent of workplace workers in Portsmouth commuted into the city in 2011. Southampton has the highest number of total jobs and commuting both into and out of the city is high. The county has a lower level of unemployment than the national average, at 1.3 per cent when the national rate is 2.1 per cent, as of February 2018. About one third are employed by large firms. Hampshire has a considerably higher than national average employment in high-tech industries, but average levels in knowledge-based industry. About 25 per cent of the population work in the public sector. Tourism accounts for some 60,000 jobs in the county, around 9 per cent of the total.

One of the principal companies in the high tech sector is IBM which has its research and development laboratories at Hursley and its UK headquarters at Cosham.

Many rural areas of Hampshire have traditionally been reliant on agriculture, particularly dairy farming, although the significance of agriculture as a rural employer and rural wealth creator has declined since the first half of the 20th century and agriculture currently employs 1.32 per cent of the rural population.

The extractive industries deal principally with sand, gravel, clay and hydrocarbons. There are three active oilfields in Hampshire with one being also used as a natural gas store. These are in the west of the county in the &quot;Wessex Basin&quot;. The &quot;Weald Basin&quot; to the east has potential as a source of shale oil but is not currently exploited.

The New Forest area is a national park, and tourism is a significant economic segment in this area, with 7.5 million visitors in 1992. The South Downs and the cities of Portsmouth, Southampton, and Winchester also attract tourists to the county. Southampton Boat Show is one of the biggest annual events held in the county, and attracts visitors from throughout the country. In 2003, the county had a total of 31 million day visits, and 4.2 million longer stays.
The cities of Southampton and Portsmouth are both significant ports, with Southampton Docks handling a large proportion of the national container freight traffic as well as being a major base for cruise liners, and Portsmouth Harbour accommodating one of the Royal Navy&#x27;s main bases and a terminal for cross-channel ferries to France and Spain. The docks have traditionally been large employers in these cities, though mechanisation of cargo handling has led to a reduction in manpower needed.

The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has its principal offices in Southampton, while the Air Accidents Investigation Branch has its head office in Farnborough in Rushmoor District . The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has one of its two offices at Farnborough.

==Transport==

===Air===
Southampton Airport, with an accompanying main line railway station, is an international airport situated in the Borough of Eastleigh, close to Swaythling in the city of Southampton. The Farnborough International Airshow is a week-long event that combines a major trade exhibition for the aerospace and defence industries with a public airshow. The event is held in mid-July in even-numbered years at Farnborough Airport. The first five days (Monday to Friday) are dedicated to trade, with the final two days open to the public.

===Sea===
Cross-channel and cross-Solent ferries from Southampton, Portsmouth and Lymington link the county to the Isle of Wight, the Channel Islands and continental Europe.

===Rail===
The South West Main Line (operated by South Western Railway) from London to Weymouth runs through Winchester and Southampton, and the Wessex Main Line from Bristol to Portsmouth also runs through the county, as does the Portsmouth Direct Line.

===Road===
The M3 motorway bisects the county from the southwest, at the edge of the New Forest near Southampton, to the northeast, on its way to connect with the M25 London orbital motorway. At its southern end it links with the M27 south coast motorway. The construction of the Twyford Down cutting near Winchester caused major controversy by cutting through a series of ancient trackways and other features of archaeological significance. The M27 serves as a bypass for the major conurbations and as a link to other settlements on the south coast. Other important roads include the A27, A3, A31, A34, A36 and A303.

The county has a high level of car ownership, with only 15.7 per cent having no access to a private car compared with 26.8 per cent for England and Wales. The county has a lower than average use of trains (3.2 compared with 4.1 per cent for commuting) and buses (3.2 to 7.4 per cent), but a higher than average use of bicycles (3.5 to 2.7 per cent) and cars (63.5 to 55.3 per cent).

===Inland waterways===
Hampshire formerly had several canals, but most of these have been abandoned and their routes built over. The Basingstoke Canal has been extensively restored, and is now navigable for most of its route, but the Salisbury and Southampton Canal, Andover Canal and Portsmouth and Arundel Canal have all disappeared. Restoration of the Itchen Navigation, linking Southampton and Winchester, primarily as a wildlife corridor, began in 2008.

==Education==
The school system in Hampshire (including Southampton and Portsmouth) is comprehensive. Geographically inside the Hampshire LEA are 24 independent schools, Southampton has three and Portsmouth has four. Few Hampshire schools have sixth forms, which varies by district council. There are 14 further education colleges within the Hampshire LEA, including six graded as &#x27;outstanding&#x27; by Ofsted: Alton College, Barton Peveril Sixth Form College, Brockenhurst College, Farnborough College of Technology, Farnborough Sixth Form College, Peter Symonds College, Queen Mary&#x27;s College, and South Downs College.

Notable independent schools in the county include Winchester College, allegedly England&#x27;s oldest public school, founded in 1382, and the pioneering co-educational Bedales School, founded in 1893.

The four universities are the University of Southampton, Solent University, the University of Portsmouth, and the University of Winchester (which also had a small campus in Basingstoke until 2011). Farnborough College of Technology awards University of Surrey-accredited degrees.

==Health==
There are major NHS hospitals in each of the cities, and smaller hospitals in several towns, as well as a number of private hospitals. Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust coordinates public health services, while Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust coordinates hospital services.

==Culture, arts and sport==
===Flag===

The Flag of Hampshire was officially added to the Flag Institute&#x27;s registry of flags on 12 March 2019 after receiving support from Hampshire County Council, the Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire, and many local organisations. The county day and flag day is 15 July, St Swithun&#x27;s Day; St Swithun was an Anglo-Saxon bishop of Winchester.

===Music===
Hampshire is the home of many orchestras, bands, and groups. Musician Laura Marling hails originally from Hampshire. The Hampshire County Youth Choir is based in Winchester, and has had successful tours of Canada and Italy in recent years. The Hampshire County Youth Orchestra (with its associated chamber orchestra and string orchestra) is based at Thornden Hall.

===Museums===

There are a number of local museums, such as the City Museum in Winchester, which covers the Iron Age and Roman periods, the Middle Ages, and the Victorian period over three floors. A &quot;Museum of the Iron Age&quot; is in Andover. Solent Sky Museum depicts the story of aviation in Hampshire and the Solent region, with more than 20 airframes from the golden age. Southampton&#x27;s Sea City Museum is primarily focused on the city&#x27;s links with the &quot;Titanic&quot;. Basingstoke&#x27;s Milestones Museum records the county&#x27;s industrial heritage. There are also a number of national museums in Hampshire. The National Motor Museum is located in the New Forest at Beaulieu. The Royal Navy Museum is part of Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Other military museums include The Submarine Museum at Gosport, the Royal Marines Museum, originally in Southsea but was due to transfer to the Dockyard in 2019, the Aldershot Military Museum, the D-Day Story by Southsea Castle and the Museum of Army Flying at Middle Wallop. Several museums and historic buildings in Hampshire are the responsibility of the Hampshire Cultural Trust. Specialist museums include the Gilbert White museum in his old home in Selborne, which also includes The Oates Collection, dedicated to the explorer Lawrence Oates.

===Annual events===
The New Forest and Hampshire County Show takes place annually at the end of July; 2020 will mark its centenary. The largest gathering of Muslims in Western Europe, Jalsa Salana, takes place near Alton, with 37,000 visitors in 2017. The ancient festival of Beltain takes place at Butser Ancient Farm in the spring.

===Buildings and protected monuments===

===Sport===

The game of cricket was largely developed in south-east England, with one of the first teams forming at Hambledon in 1750, with the Hambledon Club creating many of cricket&#x27;s early laws. Hampshire County Cricket Club is a first-class team. The main county ground is the Utilita Bowl in West End, which has hosted one day internationals and which, following redevelopment, hosted its first test match in 2011.

The world&#x27;s oldest surviving bowling green is the Southampton Old Bowling Green, which was first used in 1299.

Hampshire&#x27;s relatively safe waters have allowed the county to develop as one of the busiest sailing areas in the country, with many yacht clubs and several manufacturers on the Solent. The Hamble, Beaulieu and Lymington rivers are major centres for both competitive and recreational sailing, along with Hythe and Ocean Village marinas. The sport of windsurfing was invented at Hayling Island in the south east of the county.
Hampshire has several association football teams, including Premier League side Southampton, EFL Championship side Portsmouth and National League sides Aldershot Town, Eastleigh and Havant &amp; Waterlooville. Portsmouth and Southampton have traditionally been fierce rivals. Portsmouth won the FA Cup in 1939 and 2008 and the Football League title in 1949 and 1950. Southampton won the FA Cup in 1976 and reached the final in 1900, 1902, and 2003, as well as finishing second in the Football League in 1984. Aldershot were members of the Football League from 1932 until they folded in 1992. They were succeeded by Aldershot Town, who in 2008 were crowned the Conference Premier champions and promoted to the Football League but were relegated back to the Conference at the end of the 2012–13 season. Hampshire has a number of Non League football teams. Bashley, Gosport Borough and AFC Totton play in the Southern Football League Premier Division, and Sholing and Winchester City play in the Southern Football League Division One South and West.

<doc id="13862" wikidata="Q725757" url="?curid=13862" title="Hard science fiction">
<text>Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by concern for scientific accuracy and logic. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Islands of Space&quot; in the November issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. The complementary term &quot;soft science fiction&quot;, formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the &quot;hard&quot; (natural) and &quot;soft&quot; (social) sciences, first appeared in the late 1970s. Though there are examples generally considered as &quot;hard&quot; science fiction such as Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; series, built on mathematical sociology, science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that while neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy, they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.

==History==
Stories revolving around scientific and technical consistency were written as early as the 1870s with the publication of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; in 1870, among other stories. The attention to detail in Verne&#x27;s work became an inspiration for many future scientists and explorers, although Verne himself denied writing as a scientist or seriously predicting machines and technology of the future.

Hugo Gernsback believed from the beginning of his involvement with science fiction in the 1920s that the stories should be instructive, although it was not long before he found it necessary to print fantastical and unscientific fiction in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; to attract readers. During Gernsback&#x27;s long absence from science fiction (SF) publishing, from 1936 to 1953, the field evolved away from his focus on facts and education. The Golden Age of Science Fiction is generally considered to have started in the late 1930s and lasted until the mid-1940s, bringing with it &quot;a quantum jump in quality, perhaps the greatest in the history of the genre&quot;, according to science fiction historians Peter Nicholls and Mike Ashley.

However, Gernsback&#x27;s views were unchanged. In his editorial in the first issue of &quot;Science-Fiction Plus&quot;, he gave his view of the modern SF story: &quot;the fairy tale brand, the weird or fantastic type of what mistakenly masquerades under the name of Science-Fiction today!&quot; and he stated his preference for &quot;truly scientific, prophetic Science-Fiction with the full accent on SCIENCE&quot;. In the same editorial, Gernsback called for patent reform to give science fiction authors the right to create patents for ideas without having patent models because many of their ideas predated the technical progress needed to develop specifications for their ideas. The introduction referenced the numerous prescient technologies described throughout &quot;Ralph 124C 41+&quot;.

==Definition==
The heart of the &quot;hard science fiction&quot; designation is the relationship of the science content and attitude to the rest of the narrative, and (for some readers, at least) the &quot;hardness&quot; or rigor of the science itself. One requirement for hard SF is procedural or intentional: a story should try to be accurate, logical, credible and rigorous in its use of current scientific and technical knowledge about which technology, phenomena, scenarios and situations that are practically or theoretically possible. For example, the development of concrete proposals for spaceships, space stations, space missions, and a US space program in the 1950s and 1960s influenced a widespread proliferation of &quot;hard&quot; space stories. Later discoveries do not necessarily invalidate the label of hard SF, as evidenced by P. Schuyler Miller, who called Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s 1961 novel &quot;A Fall of Moondust&quot; hard SF, and the designation remains valid even though a crucial plot element, the existence of deep pockets of &quot;moondust&quot; in lunar craters, is now known to be incorrect.

There is a degree of flexibility in how far from &quot;real science&quot; a story can stray before it leaves the realm of hard SF. Hard science fiction authors only include more controversial devices when the ideas draw from well-known scientific and mathematical principles. In contrast, authors writing softer SF use such devices without a scientific basis (sometimes referred to as &quot;enabling devices&quot;, since they allow the story to take place).

Readers of &quot;hard SF&quot; often try to find inaccuracies in stories. For example, a group at MIT concluded that the planet Mesklin in Hal Clement&#x27;s 1953 novel &quot;Mission of Gravity&quot; would have had a sharp edge at the equator, and a Florida high school class calculated that in Larry Niven&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Ringworld&quot; the topsoil would have slid into the seas in a few thousand years. Niven fixed these errors in his sequel &quot;The Ringworld Engineers&quot;, and noted them in the foreword.

<doc id="13863" wikidata="Q1638223" url="?curid=13863" title="Handloading">
<text>Handloading, or reloading, is the practice of making firearm cartridges by manually assembling the individual components (metallic/polymer case, primer, propellant and projectile), rather than purchasing mass-assembled, factory-loaded commercial ammunition. (It should not be confused with the reloading of a firearm &quot;with&quot; cartridges, such as by swapping detachable magazines, or using a stripper clip or speedloader to quickly insert new cartridges into a magazine.)

The term &quot;handloading&quot; is the more general term, and refers generically to the manual assembly of ammunition cartridges. &quot;Reloading&quot; refers more specifically to handloading using previously fired cases and shotshells. The terms are often used interchangeably however, as the techniques are largely the same, whether the handloader is using new or recycled components. The differences lie in the initial preparation of cases or shells — new components are generally ready to load straight out of the box, while previously fired components often need additional preparation procedures, such as removal of expended primers (&quot;depriming&quot;), case cleaning (to remove any fouling or rust) and the reshaping and resizing of cases (to correct any pre-existing deformations or to experiment with custom modifications).

== Advantages ==
Some consider handloading cartridges or shotshells a hobby, but reloading can save the shooter money, providing a greater quantity of higher quality ammunition within a given budget. However, hobbyists&#x27; enjoyment of the reloading process may be a significant benefit.

=== Economy ===
Handloading ammunition avoids the labor costs of commercial production lines, reducing the expenditure to only the cost of purchasing components and equipment. Reloading may not be cost effective for occasional shooters, as it takes time to recoup the cost of needed equipment, but those who shoot more frequently will see cost-savings over time, as the brass cartridge cases and shotgun shell hulls, which are often the most expensive components, can be reused with proper maintenance.

=== Specialized ammunition ===
For new or recoil sensitive shooters, reduced pressure loads can be assembled. These allow these shooters to shoot with less flinch inducing recoil. This technique also enables hunters to use the same rifle and caliber to hunt a greater diversity of game. For instance, in the same cartridge/rifle combination, using a light for caliber bullet for varmint and heavy for caliber for large game. Collectors of rare, antique and foreign-made firearms must often turn to handloading because the appropriate cartridges and shotshells are no longer commercially available.

=== Improved ballistic performance ===
There are three aspects to ballistics: internal ballistics, external ballistics, and terminal ballistics. Internal ballistics refers to things that happen inside the firearm during and after firing, but before the bullet leaves the muzzle. The handloading process can realize increased accuracy and precision through improved consistency of manufacture, by selecting the optimal bullet weight and design, and tailoring bullet velocity to the purpose. Each cartridge reloaded can have each component carefully matched to the rest of the cartridges in the batch. Brass cases can be matched by volume, weight, and concentricity, bullets by weight and design, powder charges by weight, type, case filling (amount of total usable case capacity filled by charge), and packing scheme (characteristics of granule packing).

Handloading is a fundamental prerequisite for success where the most extreme accuracy is demanded, such as in rifle benchrest shooting, but can only be done consistently accurately following load development to determine what cartridge components work best with a specific rifle.

Customized performance is a common goal of handloaders. Hunters may desire cartridges with specialized bullets with specific terminal performance. Target shooters often experiment extensively with component combinations in an effort to achieve the best and most consistent bullet trajectories, often using cartridge cases that have been fire formed in order to best fit the chamber of a specific firearm. Shotgun shooters can make specialty rounds unavailable through commercial inventories at any price. Some handloaders even customize cartridges and shotshells to reduce recoil for shooters who might otherwise avoid shooting sports because of the high recoil of certain firearms. Some handloaders make increased-power ammunition (i.e. &quot;hot loads&quot;) if higher muzzle velocities (hence flatter trajectories) are desired.

=== More versatility over commercial ammunition ===
The equipment used to assemble the cartridge has an effect on its uniformity/consistency and optimal shape/size. Dies used to size the cartridges can be matched to the chamber of a given gun. Modern handloading equipment enables a firearm owner to tailor fresh ammunition to a specific firearm, and to precisely measured tolerances far improving the comparatively wide tolerances within which commercial ammunition manufacturers must operate. Recurring shortages of commercial ammunition are also reasons to reload cartridges and shotshells. Store-bought ammunition may be unavailable at when commercial supplies are exhausted, but having the ability to reload one&#x27;s own cartridges and shotshells allows continue shooting despite shortages.

Handloaders can also experiment with resizing and create newer-specification cartridges for which no commercial equivalent has ever existed — so-called wildcat cartridges, some of which can eventually acquire mainstream acceptance if the ballistic performance is proven to be good enough. Once the new cartridge has achieved widespread market adoption, handloading components can also be acquired at discounted prices when purchased in bulk. Examples of such cartridges include the .22-250, 6mm PPC, 7mm-08 and .260 Remington. Some cartridges initially purely designed for handloaded target shooting, such as the 6.5mm Creedmoor and the 6.5mm Grendel, have not only gained mainstream acceptance in the civilian market but also partial adoption by regular military.

== Equipment ==

Inexpensive &quot;tong&quot; tools have been used for reloading since the mid-19th century. They resemble a large pair of pliers and can be caliber-specific or have interchangeable dies. However, modern handloading equipment can be sophisticated tools that emphasize precision and reliability. There are also a myriad of various measuring tools and accessory products on the market for use in conjunction with handloading.

=== Presses ===

The quintessential handloading equipment is the press, which uses compound leverage to push the cases into a die that performs the loading operations. Presses vary from simple, inexpensive single-stage models, to complex &quot;progressive&quot; models that can perform multiple operations with each pull of the lever, like an assembly line, at rates exceeding 500 rounds per hour.

Loading presses are often categorized by the letter of the English alphabet that they most resemble in shape: &quot;O&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;H&quot;. The sturdiest presses, suitable for bullet swaging functions as well as for normal reloading die usage, are of the &quot;O&quot; type, which has a frame that completely encloses the die mechanism. The &quot;C&quot; frame, usually a less sturdy press, is suitable for most handloading operations other than bullet swaging. Iron, steel and aluminum construction are seen with all presses. Some users prefer &quot;C&quot; style presses over &quot;O&quot; presses, as access to the operational area is much more open. Shotshell style presses, intended for non-batch use, for which each shotshell or cartridge is cycled through the dies before commencing onto the next shotshell or cartridge to be reloaded, commonly resemble the letter &quot;H&quot;.

&quot;Single-stage press&quot;, generally of the &quot;O&quot; or &quot;C&quot; type, is the simplest of press designs. These presses can only hold one die and perform a single procedure on a single case at any time. Each operation, resize, deprime, bullet seating, bullet crimping, etc., requires the user to change the dies or setup. When using a single-stage press, cases are loaded in batches, one step for each cartridge per batch at a time. The batch sizes are usually kept small, usually 100 cases or less at a time. Single-stage presses are commonly used for high-precision rifle cartridge handloading, but may be used for almost any reloading operation. Single stage presses are also popular for load development prior to producing large numbers of cartridges on a progressive press.

&quot;Turret presses&quot;, most commonly of the &quot;C&quot; type, are similar to a single-stage press, but have a mounting disc (also called a die head) that indexes at each die position. This allows multiple dies to be mounted to the machine and quickly rotated into position. Batch operations are performed similar to a single-stage press, different procedures can be performed by simply rotating the turret to place the appropriate die into position. Although turret presses operate much like single-stage presses, they eliminate much of the setup time required by removing and installing individual dies. There are also automatic indexing turret presses which rotate the turret one position with each pull of the handle. These presses allow the user to quickly change caliber by swapping die heads (turrets) and produce one complete round with 3-6 pulls of the handle.

&quot;Progressive presses&quot; are far more complex in design and operation and initial setup usually takes longer. However, the benefit is increased output. Progressives can handle several cases at once. These presses have a rotating shell holder/plate that indexes at each individual station with each pull of the lever. Progressives can hold 3 or more dies in interchangeable toolhead assemblies. The toolhead assembly allows the user to quickly change calibers with minimal readjustment of the dies. The dies, and sometimes loading modules (which can include case hopper/feeder, primer feeder, powder measure and/or bullet feeder), are mounted to be in alignment with the corresponding index position on the shell holder/plate. Progressives can have 4 or more stations, extra stations allow for the addition of optional equipment such as a powder level checkers. Progressive presses can load hundreds of cartridges an hour with their streamlined efficiency. All the user has to do is pull the lever to produce one finished round per stroke.

====Shotshell presses====
Shotshell presses are generally a single unit of the &quot;H&quot; configuration that handles all functions, dedicated to reloading just one gauge of shotshell. Shotshell reloading is similar to cartridge reloading, except that, instead of a bullet, a wad and a measure of shot are used, and after loading the shot, the shell is crimped shut. Both 6 and 8 fold crimps are in use, for paper hulls and plastic hulls. Roll crimps can be used for metallic, paper, and plastic hulls. The shotshell loader contains stations to resize and deprime the hull, reprime the hull, measure powder, insert the wad, measure shot, and crimp the shell. 
Due to the low cost of modern plastic shotshells, and the additional complexity of reloading fired shells, shotshell handloading is not as popular as cartridge handloading. For example, unlike when handloading rifle and pistol cartridges, where some of the various components (cases and bullets of the same weight) from different manufacturers are usually interchangeable, shotshell loads are usually restricted to using only the particular brand or design of shotshell hull, a specific brand/style of wad or shot column components, primer and powder that are called for in the recipe. Substitution of components is not considered safe, as changing just one component, such as a brand of primer, can increase pressures by as much as 3500 PSI, which may exceed SAAMI pressure limits. Reloading shotshells is therefore more along the lines of precisely following a recipe with non-fungible components.

Where shotshell reloading remains popular is for making specialized shotgun shells, such as for providing lowered recoil, for achieving better shot patterns, to make low-cost &quot;poppers&quot; (blanks) used to acclimate hunting dogs to the sound of gunfire without actually shooting projectiles or to manufacture obsolete shotshells that are no longer commercially manufactured. Handloading also allows the loader to make other improvements or features not available in commercially loaded shotshells.

Metallic reloading presses are not usually dedicated to reloading a single caliber of cartridge, although they can be, but are designed to allow for reloading various cartridge calibers through changing the dies. In contrast, shotshell presses are most often configured for reloading just one gauge of shotshell, e.g., 12 gauge, and are rarely, if ever, reconfigured for reloading other gauges of shotshells, as the cost of tooling and time to switch gauges on a shotshell press often exceeds the cost of buying a new shotshell press outright, as shotshell presses typically come from the factory already set up to reload one gauge or bore of shotshell. Hence, it is common to use a dedicated shotshell press for reloading each gauge or bore of shotshell used.

The price of shot for reloading shotshells over the last several years has also risen significantly, such that lead shot that was readily available for around $0.50/lb. (c. 2005) now reaches $2.00 per pound (2013.) Due to this large increase in the price of lead shot, the economy of reloading 12 gauge shotshells vs. just using promotional (low-cost) 12 gauge shotshells only starts to make economic sense for higher volume shooters, who may shoot more than 50,000 rounds a year. In contrast, the reloading of shotshells that are usually not available in low-cost, promotional pricings, such as .410 bore, 12 ga. slugs, 16 ga, 20 ga., and 28 ga., becomes more economical to reload in much smaller quantities, perhaps within only 3-5 boxes of shells per year. Reloading .410 bore, 12 ga. slugs, 16 ga., 20 ga, and 28 ga. shells, therefore, remains relatively common, more so than the reloading of 12 gauge shotshells, for which promotional shotshells are usually readily available from many retailers. These smaller bore and gauge shotshells also require much less lead shot, further lessening the effect of the rapid rises seen in the price of lead shot. The industry change to steel shot, arising from the US and Canadian Federal bans on using lead shotshells while hunting migratory wildfowl, has also affected reloading shotshells, as the shot bar and powder bushing required on a dedicated shotshell press also must be changed for each hull type reloaded, and are different than what would be used for reloading shotshells with lead shot, further complicating the reloading of shotshells.

With the recent rampant rise in lead shot prices, though, a major change in handloading shotshells has also occurred. Namely, a transition among high volume 12 gauge shooters from loading traditional 1-1/8 oz. shot loads to 7/8 oz. shot loads or even 24 gm. (so-called International) shot loads have occurred. At 1-1/8 oz. per shotshell, a 25 lb. bag of lead shot can only reload approximately 355 shotshells. At 7/8 oz. per shotshell, a 25 lb. of lead shot can reload 457 shotshells. At 24 grams per shotshell, a 25 lb of lead shot can reload approximately 472 shotshells. Stretching the number of hulls that it is possible to reload from an industry-standard 25 lb. bag of lead shot by 117 shells has significantly helped mitigate the large increase in the price of lead shot. That this change has also resulted in minimal changes to scores in shooting sports such as skeet and trap has only expedited the switch among high volume shooters to shooting 24 gm. shotshells with their lesser amounts of shot.

With the recent shortages over 2012–2013 of 12 gauge shotshells in the United States (among all other types of rifle and pistol ammunition), the popularity of reloading 12 gauge shotshells has seen a widespread resurgence. Field use of the International 24 gm. 12 gauge shells has proven them to be effective on small game, while stretching the number of reloads possible from a bag of shot, and they have subsequently become popular for hunting small game. Since shot shells are typically reloaded at least 5 times, although upwards of 15 times are often possible for lightly loaded shells, this transition to field use of 24 gm. loads has helped mitigate ammunition shortages for hunters.

Shotshell presses typically use a charge bar to drop precise amounts of shot and powder. Most commonly, these charge bars are fixed in their capacities, with a single charge bar rated at, say, 1-1/8 oz. of lead shot, with a switchable powder bushing that permits dropping precisely measured fixed amounts of different types of powder repetitively (e.g., MEC.) On the other hand, some charge bars are drilled to accept bushings for dropping different fixed amounts of both shot and powder (e.g. Texan.) For the ultimate in flexibility, though, universal charge bars with micrometers dropping fixed volumes of powder and shot are also available; these are able to select differing fixed amounts of both powder and shot, and are popular for handloaders who load more than just a few published recipes, or, especially, among those who wish to experiment with numerous different published recipes. Fixed charge bars are rated for either lead or steel shot, but not for both. Universal charge bars, on the other hand, are capable of reloading both lead and steel shot, being adjustable.

Like their pistol and rifle counterparts, shotshell presses are available in both single-stage and progressive varieties. For shooters shooting fewer than approximately 500 shells a month, and especially shooting fewer than 100 shells a month, a single-stage press is often found to be adequate. For shooters shooting larger numbers of shells a month, progressive presses are often chosen. A single-stage press can typically reload 100 hulls in approximately an hour. Progressive presses can typically reload upwards of 400 or 500 hulls an hour.

Shotshell presses are most commonly operated in non-batch modes. That is, a single hull will often be deprimed, reshaped, primed, loaded with powder, have a wad pressed in, be loaded with shot, be pre-crimped, and then be final crimped before being removed and a new hull being placed on the shotshell press at station 1. An alternative, somewhat faster method, often used on a single stage press is to work on 5 hulls in parallel sequentially, with but a single processed hull being located at each of the 5 stations available on a single stage shotshell press, while manually removing the finished shotshell from station 5 and then moving the 4 in-process hulls to the next station (1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5) before adding a new hull at the deprimer (station 1) location. Both these modes of shotshell reloading are in distinct contrast to the common practice used with reloading pistol and rifle cartridges on a single-stage press, which is most often processed in batch modes, where a common operation will commonly be done on a batch of up to 50 or 100 cartridges at a time, before proceeding to the next processing step. This difference is largely a result of shotshell presses having 5 stations available for use simultaneously, unlike a single-stage cartridge press which typically has but one station available for use.

In general, though, shotshell reloading is far more complex than rifle and pistol cartridge reloading, and hence far fewer shotshell presses are therefore used relative to rifle and pistol cartridge reloading presses.

====.50 BMG and larger cartridge presses====
Reloading presses for reloading .50 BMG and larger cartridges are also typically caliber-specific, much like shotshell presses, as standard-size rifle and pistol reloading presses are not capable of being pressed into such exotic reloading service. The reloading of such large cartridges is also much more complex, as developing a load using a specific lot of powder can require nearly all of a 5 lb. bottle of powder and a load must be developed with a single load of powder for reasons of safety.

=== Dies ===
 Dies are generally sold in sets of two, three or four units, depending on the type and shape of the case. A three-die set is needed for straight cases, while a two-die set is used for bottlenecked cases. The first die of either set performs the sizing and decapping operation, except in some cases in the 3-die set, where decapping may be done by the second die. The middle die in a three-die set is used to flare the case mouth as well as allows powder to be added to the case (and decap in the case where this is not done by the first die), while in a two-die set the entire neck is expanded as the case is extracted from the first die. The second or third die in the set seats the bullet and may apply a crimp. A fourth die is often used to apply crimps after the bullet is seated. Sometimes an additional &quot;die&quot; is used to mount powder measures which makes dispensing powder into the case a part of the process. This die usually flares the case mouth to allow easier bullet insertion.

Standard dies are made from hardened steel, and require that the case be lubricated for the resizing operation, which requires a large amount of force. Bottleneck and longer straight cartridges require lubrication of every case, due to the large amount of force required, while shorter straight wall cartridges (9mm or .45ACP for example) can get away with alternating lubricated and unlubricated cases. Carbide dies have a ring of tungsten carbide, which is far harder and slicker than tool steel, carbide straight wall dies do not require lubrication, however bottle neck dies do.

Modern reloading dies are generally standardized with 7/8-14 (or, for the case of .50 BMG dies, with 1-1/4×12) threads and are interchangeable with all common brands of presses, although older dies may use other threads and be press-specific.

===Crimping Dies ===
Sometimes die sets include a separate die for crimping and this is done as an extra operation. There are two types of crimp, roll and taper. Crimping is required for several reasons such as autoloading firearms, firearms with a tubular magazine or pistols with massive recoil (.500 S&amp;W), where the cycling or recoil of the firearm may cause the bullet to move in the case, resulting in poor accuracy, increased pressures or malfunctions. Some reloaders will only crimp only if absolutely necessary.

Roll crimping is usually appropriate for everything except cartridges that headspace on the case mouth (I.E. 9MM and .45ACP). Magnum straight wall and bottleneck cartridges ar usually roll crimped. Bullets that require roll crimping usually have a cannelure on the bullet, this prevents bullet deformation when crimping.

Cases which headspace on the case mouth, on the other hand, require a taper crimp, because they require a flat surface at the case mouth; roll crimping will cause headspacing problems on these cartridges.

===Special Dies===
There are also specialty dies. Bump dies are designed to move the shoulder of a bottleneck case back just a bit to facilitate chambering. These are frequently used in conjunction with neck dies, as the bump die itself does not manipulate the neck of the case whatsoever. A bump die can be a very useful tool to anyone who owns a fine shooting rifle with a chamber that is cut to minimum headspace dimensions, as the die allows the case to be fitted to this unique chamber. Another die is the &quot;hand die&quot;. A hand die has no threads and is operated—as the name suggests—by hand or by use of a hand-operated arbor press. Hand dies are available for most popular cartridges, and although available as full-length resizing dies, they are most commonly seen as neck sizing dies. These use an interchangeable insert to size the neck, and these inserts come in 1/1000-inch steps so that the user can custom fit the neck of the case to his own chamber or have greater control over neck tension on the bullet.

=== Shellholders ===

A shell holder, generally sold separately, is needed to hold the case in place as it is forced into and out of the dies. The reason shellholders are sold separately is that many cartridges share the same base dimensions, and a single shell holder can service many different cases. While most modern single stage presses use a standard shell holder some older presses may need special holders.

Progressive presses, however, may use shell holders specific to the press manufacturer, and will generally only fit a certain make and model of reloading press. A different type of shell holder is also required for use with some hand priming tools (e.g., Lee Autoprime tool) as well as trimming tools.

=== Scale ===

A precision weighing scale is a near necessity for reloading. While it is possible to load using nothing but a powder measure and a weight-to-volume conversion chart, this greatly limits the precision with which a load can be adjusted, increasing the danger of accidentally overloading cartridges with powder for loads near or at the maximum safe load. With a powder scale, an adjustable powder measure can be adjusted to more precisely meter the powder charge. Additionally, periodically checking the powder charge during a reloading session can make sure that the measure is not drifting. With a powder trickler, a charge can be measured directly into the scale, giving the most accurate measure.

A scale also allows bullets and cases to be sorted by weight, which can further increase consistency. Sorting bullets by weight has obvious benefits, as each set of matched bullets will perform more consistently. Sorting cases by weight is done to group cases by case volume, and match cases with similar interior volumes.

There are 3 types of reloading scales:

* Mechanical reloading scale (they are measured manually with no usage of power).
* Digital Scales (they need electricity or batteries to operate).
* Digital Scales with dispenser (they unite both reloading scales and dispense options into one version).

=== Priming tool ===

Single-stage presses often do not provide an easy way of installing primers to (&quot;priming&quot;) cases. Various add-on tools can be used for priming the case using the press, or a separate tool can be used. Since cases loaded by a single-stage press are done in steps, with the die being changed between steps, a purpose-made, separate, priming tool is often faster than setting up a press to prime. Also, hand primers can be more consistent in setting primer depth due to being able to &quot;feel&quot; what the toolis doing.

=== Powder measuring ===
Powder is measured by weight (usually grains or grams) but can dispensed by volume. Beginning reloading kits often include a weight-to-volume conversion chart for a selection of common powders and a set of powder volume measures graduated in small increments. By adding the various measures of powder the desired charge can be measured with a safe degree of accuracy. However, since weighing individual powder charges or using &quot;dippers&quot; can be time-consuming, a powder measuring dispensor is often used. A powder measure has a changeable or adjustable cavity to adjust the volume of the charge. A powder measure accurate to is desirable.

A final type of dispenser is an all in one electronic scale and trickler. These will automatically dispense the next charge after the pan is returned to the scale.

Additionally, a powder trickler can be used to slowly add powder to a volumetrically measured charge on a scale to bring the charge up to the desired amount. Tricklers allow vey precise powder charges.
=== Case trimmer ===

Cases that have been fired and reloaded numerous times will need trimming due to brass flowing forward during firing, especially bottleneck cases. How much a case will grow depends upon load pressure, cartridge design, chamber size, functional cartridge headspace (usually the most important factor), and other variables. Periodically cases need to be trimmed to bring them back to proper specifications. Most reloading manuals list both a &quot;trim size&quot; and a &quot;max length&quot;. Long cases can create a safety hazard through improper headspace and possible increased pressure.

Several kinds of case trimmers are available. Die-based trimmers have an open top and allow the case to be trimmed with a file during the loading process. Manual trimmers usually have a base that has a shellholder at one end and a cutting bit at the opposite end, with a locking mechanism to hold the case tight and in alignment with the axis of the cutter, similar to a small lathe. Typically the device is cranked by hand, but sometimes they have attachments to allow the use of a drill or powered screwdriver. Powered case trimmers are also available. They usually consist of a motor (electric drills are sometimes used) and special dies or fittings that hold the case to be trimmed at the appropriate length, letting the motor do the work of trimming.

===Case Cleaning===

Cleaning can be done with an ultrasonic cleaner, or more commonly with a mass finishing device known as a &quot;case tumbler&quot;. Tumblers use abrasive granules known as &quot;tumbling media&quot; (which can be stone or ceramic granules, fragments of corncob or walnut/coconut shells, or small segments of stainless steel wire often called &quot;pins&quot;) to burnish the cases, and can be either a vibratory type (&quot;dry tumbling&quot;) or a water/detergent-based rotary type (&quot;wet tumbling&quot;). In either type, when the cleaning is completed, a &quot;media separator&quot; is needed to sieve out and remove the abrasive media. In the &quot;wet&quot; rotary tumbling, a food dehydrator-like convection dryer is sometimes used to eliminate moisture retention that might later interfere with handloading.

===Primer pocket tools===
Primer pocket cleaning tools are used to remove residual combustion debris remaining in the primer pocket; both brush designs and single blade designs are commonly used. Dirty primer pockets can prevent setting primers at, or below, the cartridge head. Primer pocket reamers or swagers are used to remove military crimps in primer pockets.

Primer pocket uniformer tools are used to achieve a uniform primer pocket depth. These are small endmills with a fixed depth-spacing ring attached, and are mounted either in a handle for use as a handtool, or are sometimes mounted in a battery-operated screwdriver. Some commercial cartridges (notably Sellier &amp; Bellot) use large rifle primers that are thinner than the SAAMI standards common in the United States, and will not permit seating a Boxer primer manufactured to U.S. standards; the use of a primer pocket uniformer tool on such brass avoids setting Boxer primers high when reloading, which would be a safety issue. Two sizes of primer pocket uniformer tools exist, the larger one is for large rifle (0.130-inch nominal depth) primer pockets and the smaller one is used for uniforming small rifle/pistol primer pockets.

Primer pocket swages can be either standalone, bench-mounted, specialized presses, or, alternatively, a special swage anvil die that can be mounted into a standard &quot;O&quot; style loading press, along with a special shell holder insert with either a large or a small primer pocket insert swage that is then inserted into the position on the &quot;O&quot; press where a normal shell holder is usually clicked into position. This way, both small and large primer pockets on different types of military cases can be properly processed to remove primer pocket crimps. Both types of presses can be used to remove either ring crimps or stab crimps found on military cartridges when reloading them. Reamers for removing primer pocket crimps are not associated with presses, being an alternative to using a press to remove military case primer pocket crimps.

Flash hole uniforming tools are used to remove any burrs, which are residual brass remaining from the manufacturing punching operation used in creating flash holes. These tools resemble primer pocket uniformer tools, except being thinner, and commonly include deburring, chamfering, and uniforming functions. The purpose of these tools is to achieve a more equal distribution of flame from the primer to ignite the powder charge, resulting in consistent ignition from case to case.

===Headspace gauges and modified case gauges===
Bottleneck rifle cartridges are particularly prone to encounter incipient head separations if they are full-length re-sized and re-trimmed to their maximum permitted case lengths each time they are reloaded. In some such cartridges, such as the .303 British when used in Enfield rifles, as few as 1 or 2 reloadings can be the limit before the head of the cartridge will physically separate from the body of the cartridge when fired. The solution to this problem, of avoiding overstretching of the brass case, and thereby avoiding the excessive thinning of the wall thickness of the brass case due to case stretching, is to use what is called a &quot;headspace gauge&quot;. Contrary to its name, it does not actually measure a rifle&#x27;s headspace. Rather, it measures the distance from the head of the cartridge to the middle of the shoulder of the bottleneck cartridge case. For semi-automatic and automatic rifles, the customary practice is to move the midpoint of this shoulder back by no more than 0.005 inches, for reliable operation, when resizing the case. For bolt-action rifles, with their additional camming action, the customary practice is to move this shoulder back by only 0.001 to 0.002 inches when resizing the case. In contrast to full-length resizing of bottleneck rifle cartridges, which can rapidly thin out the wall thickness of bottleneck rifle cartridges due to case stretching that occurs each time when fired, partial length re-sizing of the bottleneck case pushes shoulders back only a few thousandths of an inch will often permit a case to be safely reloaded 5 times or more, even up to 10 times, or more for very light loads.

Similarly, by using modified case gauges, it is possible to measure precisely the distance from a bullet ogive to the start of rifling in a particular rifle for a given bottleneck cartridge. Maximum accuracy for a rifle is often found to occur for only one particular fixed distance from the start of rifling in a bore to a datum line on a bullet ogive. Measuring the overall cartridge length does not permit setting such fixed distances accurately, as different bullets from different manufacturers will often have a different ogive shape. It is only by measuring from a fixed diameter point on a bullet ogive to the start of a bore&#x27;s rifling that proper spacing can be determined to maximize accuracy. A modified case gauge can provide the means by which to achieve an improvement in accuracy with precision handloads.

Such head space gauges and modified case gauges can, respectively, permit greatly increasing the number of times a rifle bottleneck case can be reloaded safely, as well as improve greatly the accuracy of such handloads. Unlike the situation with using expensive factory ammunition, handloaded match ammunition can be made that is vastly more accurate, and, through reloading, that can be much more affordable than anything that can be purchased, being customized for a particular rifle.

=== Bullet puller ===

Like any complex process, mistakes in handloading are easy to make, and a bullet puller device allows the handloader to disassemble mistakes. Most pullers use inertia to pull the bullet, and are often shaped like hammers. When in use, the case is locked in place in a head-down fashion inside the far end of the &quot;hammer&quot;, and then the device is swung and struck against a firm surface. The sharp impact will suddenly decelerate the case, but the inertia exerted by the heavier mass of the bullet will keep it moving and thus pull it free from the case in a few blows, while the powder and bullet will get caught by a trapping container within the puller after the separation. Collet-type pullers are also available, which use a caliber-specific clamp to grip the bullet, while a loading press is used to pull the case downwards. It is essential that the collet be a good match for the bullet diameter because a poor match can result in significant deformation of the bullet.

== Materials required ==
The following materials are needed for handloading ammunition:

*Cases or shotshell hulls. For shotshells, plastic or paper cases can be reloaded, though plastic is more durable. Steel and aluminum cases do not have the correct qualities for reloading, so a brass case is essential (although nickel-plated brass cases, while not as reformable as plain brass, can also be reloaded)
*Propellant of an appropriate type. Generally, handgun cartridges (due to shorter barrels) and shotshells (due to heavier projectile weights) use faster burning smokeless powders, and rifle cartridges use slower burning powder. The powder is generally of the &quot;smokeless&quot; type in modern cartridges, although on occasion the older black powder more commonly known as &quot;gunpowder&quot; may be used.
*Projectiles, such as bullets for handguns and rifles, or shot and wads for shotguns.
*Centerfire primers, most commonly a Boxer-type.
Case lubrication may also be needed depending on the dies used. Carbide pistol dies do not require case lubricant. For this reason, they are preferred by many, being inherently less messy in operation. In contrast, all dies for bottleneck cartridges, whether made of high-strength steel or carbide, and steel dies for pistols do require the use of a case lubricant to prevent a case become stuck in a die. (In the event that a case does ever become stuck in a die, there are stuck case remover tools that are available to remove a stuck case from the die, albeit at the loss of the particular case that became stuck.) Powder should always be stored in original containers since they are designed to split open at low pressure to prevent a dangerous pressure buildup, and any cabinet they are stored in should similarly prevent pressure buildup by allowing venting and expansion.

== Reloading process ==

===Pistol/Rifle cartridges===
The operations performed when handloading cartridges are:
* Depriming — the removal of any old, expended primers from previously fired cases. Usually done with a thin rod that is inserted into the flash hole via the case mouth and push out the primer from inside.
* Case cleaning — removal of foulings and tarnishes from the cases, optional but recommended for reused rifle or pistol cases.
* Case inspection — looking for cracks or other defects, and discard visibly imperfect cases. The interior may be inspected by a wire-feeler or feeler gauge to detect emerging interior cracks. Bent case mouths &quot;may&quot; be repaired during resizing.
* Primer pocket cleaning and flash hole uniforming (optional) — the primer pockets and flash holes will have deposits from previous primer combustion, as well as occasional deformation, that need fixing; generally only benchrest shooters perform these.
*Reaming or swage crimping the primer pocket (reloading military cases only), or milling the primer pocket depth using a primer pocket uniformer tool
*Gauging and trimming — measuring the case length and removing excess length from the case neck (as needed; rarely required with handgun cases)
*Deburring and reaming — smoothing the case mouth edge (optional, as-needed; only trimmed cases need to be deburred); some benchrest shooters also do exterior neck turning at this stage in order to make the cartridge case have a uniform thickness, so the bullet will be crimped and released with the most uniformity.
* Case lubrication — applying surface lubricant on the exterior surface of the cases to prevent them from getting stuck inside the die (carbide dies do not require lubrication).
* Resizing — modifying the shape of the case neck/shoulder and/or removing any dents and deformities.
* Priming — seating a new primer into the case (primer pockets often become loose after multiple loadings; a lack of effort being required to seat new primers indicates a loose primer pocket; cases with loose primer pockets are usually discarded, after crushing the case to prevent its reuse)
* Expanding or chamfering the case mouth — to allow easier, smoother seating of the bullet before pressing (not required for boat-tailed bullets)
* Cleaning the lubricant off the cases
* Powder charging — adding a measured amount of propellant powder into the case. This is a critical step, as incorrect powder charges are extremely dangerous, both undercharged (which can lead to a squib load) as well as overcharged (which can cause the gun to explode).
* Bullet seating — positioning the bullet in the case mouth for the correct cartridge overall length (OAL) and for aligning bullet cannelure (if present) with the case mouth
*Crimping — Pressing and tightening the case mouth to fix the bullet in place; some may hold the bullet with neck tension alone.
*Final cartridge inspection

When previously fired cases are used, they must be inspected before loading. Cases that are dirty or tarnished are often polished in a tumbler to remove oxidation and allow easier inspection of the case. Cleaning in a tumbler will also clean the interior of cases, which is often considered important for handloading high-precision target rounds. Cracked necks, non-reloadable cases (steel, aluminum, or Berdan primed cases), and signs of head separation are all reasons to reject a case. Cases are measured for length, and any that are over the recommended length is trimmed down to the minimum length. Competition shooters will also sort cases by brand and weight to ensure consistency.

Removal of the primer, called &quot;decapping&quot; or &quot;depriming&quot;, is usually done with a die containing a steel pin that punches out the primer from inside the case. Berdan primed cases require a different technique, either a hydraulic ram or a hook that punctures the primer cup and levers it out from the bottom. Military cases often have crimped-in primers, and decapping them leaves a slightly indented ring (most common) or, for some military cartridges, a set of stabbed ridges located on the edge of the primer pocket opening that inhibits or prevents seating a new primer into a decapped case. A reamer or a swage is used to remove both these styles of crimp, whether ring crimps or stab crimps. The purpose of all such primer crimps is to make military ammunition more reliable under more extreme environmental conditions. Some military cartridges also have sealants placed around primers, in addition to crimps, to provide additional protection against moisture intrusion that could deactivate the primer for any ammunition exposed to water under battlefield conditions. Decapping dies, though, easily overcome the additional resistance of sealed primers, with no significant difficulty beyond that encountered when removing non-sealed primers.

When a cartridge is fired, the internal pressure expands the case to fit the chamber in a process called obturation. To allow ease of chambering the cartridge when it is reloaded, the case is swaged back to size. Competition shooters, using bolt-action rifles that are capable of camming a tight case into place, often resize only the neck of the cartridge, called &quot;neck sizing&quot;, as opposed to the normal full-length resizing process. Neck sizing is only useful for cartridges to be re-fired in the same firearm, as the brass may be slightly oversized in some dimensions for other chambers, but the precise fit of the case to the chamber will allow greater consistency and therefore greater potential accuracy. Some believe that neck sizing will permit a larger number of reloads with a given case in contrast to full-size resizing, although this is controversial. Semi-automatic rifles and rifles with SAAMI minimum chamber dimensions often require a special &quot;small base&quot; resizing die, that sizes further down the case than normal dies, and allows for more reliable feeding.

Once the case is sized down, the inside of the neck of the case will actually be slightly smaller than the bullet&#x27;s diameter. To allow the bullet to be seated, the end of the neck is slightly expanded to allow the bullet to start into the case. Boattailed bullets need very little expansion, while unjacketed lead bullets require more expansion to prevent shaving of lead when the bullet is seated.

Priming the case is the most dangerous step of the loading process since the primers are pressure-sensitive. The use of safety glasses or goggles during priming operations can provide valuable protection in the rare event that an accidental detonation takes place. Seating a Boxer primer not only places the primer in the case, but it also seats the anvil of the primer down onto the priming compound, in effect arming the primer. A correctly seated primer will sit slightly below the surface of the case. A primer that protrudes from the case may cause a number of problems, including what is known as a &quot;slam fire,&quot; which is the firing of a case before the action is properly locked when chambering a round. This may either damage the gun and/or injure the shooter. A protruding primer will also tend to hang when feeding, and the anvil will not be seated correctly so the primer may not fire when hit by the firing pin. Primer pockets may need to be cleaned with a primer pocket brush to remove deposits that prevent the primer from being properly seated. Berdan primers must also be seated carefully, and since the anvil is part of the case, the anvil must be inspected before the primer is seated. For reloading cartridges intended for use in military-surplus firearms, rifles especially, &quot;hard&quot; primers are most commonly used instead of commercial &quot;soft&quot; primers. The use of &quot;hard&quot; primers avoids slamfires when loading finished cartridges in the military-surplus firearm. Such primers are available to handloaders commercially.

The quantity of gunpowder is specified by weight, but almost always measured by volume, especially in larger-scale operations. A powder scale is needed to determine the correct mass thrown by the powder measure, as loads are specified with a precision of 0.10 grain (6.5 mg). One grain is 1/7000 of a pound. Competition shooters will generally throw a slightly underweight charge, and use a &quot;powder trickler&quot; to add a few granules of powder at a time to the charge to bring it to the exact weight desired for maximum consistency. Special care is needed when charging large-capacity cases with fast-burning, low-volume powders. In this instance, it is possible to put two charges of powder in a case without overflowing the case, which can lead to dangerously high pressures and a significant chance of bursting the chamber of the firearm. Non-magnum revolver cartridges are the easiest to do this with, as they generally have relatively large cases, and tend to perform well with small charges of fast powders. Some powders meter (measured by volume) better than others due to the shape of each granule. When using volume to meter each charge, it is important to regularly check the charge weight on a scale throughout the process.

Competition shooters also often sort bullets by weight, often down to 0.10 grain (6.5 mg) increments. The bullet is placed in the case mouth by hand and then seated with the press. At this point, the expanded case mouth is also sized back down. A crimp can optionally be added, either by the seating die or with a separate die. Taper crimps are used for cases that are held in the chamber by the case mouth, while roll crimps may be used for cases that have headspace on a rim or on the cartridge neck. Roll crimps hold the bullet far more securely, and are preferred in situations, such as magnum revolvers, where recoil velocities are significant. A tight crimp also helps to delay the start of the bullet&#x27;s motion, which can increase chamber pressures, and help develop full power from slower burning powders (see internal ballistics).

===Shotgun shells===

Unlike the presses used for reloading metallic cartridges, the presses used for reloading shotgun shells have become standardized to contain 5 stations, with the exact configuration of these 5 stations arranged either in a circle or in a straight row. Nonetheless, the operations performed using the industry-standard 5 station shotshell presses when handloading shotshells with birdshot, although slightly different, are very similar as to when reloading metallic cartridges:
*Selecting an appropriate charge bar and powder bushing, or charge bar with shot bushing and powder bushing, or a universal charge bar (if used) for measuring shot and powder, for the shotshell press.
*Verifying that all components are properly selected (hull, primer, powder, wad, and shot). (No substitutions are allowed in components, nor in charge weights of shot and powder. The only substitution allowed is in the brand of shot and the size of the shot (#8, #9, etc. Also, no substitutions are allowed in the shot material itself (whether it is lead shot, Hevi-Shot, steel shot, etc.), as the malleability of lead shot is noticeably different than steel.)
*Loading shot and powder in the press, and verifying that the as-dropped weights are per an established, published, loading recipe using a calibrated scale. (Typically, 5 to 10 trials of shot and powder drops, each, are recommended by shotshell press or universal charge bar user manuals.) 
*Adjusting bushings or universal charge bar settings to account for small differences in densities due to lot-to-lot variations in both powder and shot.
*Inspecting each hull. (Examining for cracks or other hull defects, and discarding any visibly imperfect hulls. Also, turning each hull upside down to remove any foreign object debris before depriming.)
*Removing the fired primer and sizing/resizing the brass outer diameter at the base of the hull (Station 1).
*Inserting a primer in the well of the press, and sizing/resizing the inner diameter of the hull while inserting a new primer (Station 2).
*Verifying primer is fully seated, not raised. If primer is not fully seated, re-running operation at Station 2 until primer is fully seated.
*Positioning primed hull (at Station 3), pulling handle down, toggling charge bar to drop measured amount of powder, raising handle, inserting wad, dropping handle again to seat wad, toggling charge bar to drop measured amount of shot, raising handle.
*Pre-crimping of shell (Station 4).
*Final crimping of shell (Station 5).
*Inspecting crimping on shell. If crimp is not fully flat, re-crimping (Station 5).
*Inspecting bottles of shot and powder on the shotshell press, adding more as needed before it runs out.
*Cutting open 4 or 5 shells randomly selected from a large lot of handloaded shells, respectively, and verifying that the as-thrown weights of powder and shot are both within desired tolerances of the published recipe that was followed. (Optional, but recommended.)

The exact details for accomplishing these steps on particular shotshell presses vary depending on the brand of the press, although the presence of 5 stations is standard among all modern presses.

The use of safety glasses or goggles while reloading shotshells can provide valuable protection in the rare event that an accidental detonation takes place during priming operations.

The quantities of both gunpowder and shot are specified by weight when loading shotshells, but almost always measured solely by volume. A powder scale is therefore needed to determine the correct mass thrown by the powder measure, and by the shot measure, as powder loads are specified with a precision of 0.10 grain (6.5 mg), but are usually thrown with a tolerance of 0.2 to 0.3 grains in most shotshell presses. Similarly, shot payloads in shells are generally held to within a tolerance of plus or minus 3-5 grains. One grain is 1/7000 of a pound.

Shotshell reloading for specialty purposes, such as for buckshot or slugs, or other specialty rounds, is often practiced but varies significantly from the process steps discussed previously for handloading birdshot shotshells. The primary difference is that large shot cannot be metered in a charge bar, and so must be manually dropped, a ball at a time, in a specific configuration. Likewise, the need for specialty wads or extra wads, in order to achieve the desired stackup distance to achieve a full and proper crimp for a fixed shell length, say 2-3/4&quot;, causes the steps to differ slightly when handloading such shells.

Modern shotshells are all uniformly sized for Type 209 primers. However, reloaders should be aware that older shotshells were sometimes primed with a Type 57 or Type 69 primer (now obsolete), meaning that shotgun shell reloading tends to be done only with modern (or recently produced) components. Being essentially &quot;published recipe&quot; dependent, antique shotshell reloading is not widely practiced, being more of a specialty, or niche, activity. Of course, when reloading for very old shotguns, such as those with Damascus barrels, special shotshell recipes that limit pressures to less than 4500 psi are still available, and these &quot;recipes&quot; are reloaded by some shotgunning enthusiasts. Typical shotshell pressures for handloads intended for modern shotguns range from approximately 4700 psi to 10,000 psi.

Brass shotshells are also reloaded, occasionally, but typically these are reloaded using standard rifle/pistol reloading presses with specialty dies, rather than with modern shotshell presses. Rather than plastic wads, traditional felt and paperboard wads are also generally used (both over powder and over shot) when reloading brass shotgun shells. Reloading brass shotshells is not widely practiced.

Shotguns, in general, operate at much lower pressures than pistols and rifles, typically operating at pressures of 10,000 psi, or less, for 12 gauge shells, whereas rifles and pistols routinely are operated at pressures in excess of 35,000 psi, and sometimes upwards of 50,000 psi. The SAAMI maximum permitted pressure limit is only 11,500 psi for 12 gauge 2-3/4 inch shells, so the typical operating pressures for many shotgun shells are only slightly below the maximum permitted pressures allowed for safe ammunition. Because of this small difference in typical operating vs. maximum industry allowed pressures and the fact that even small changes in components can cause pressure variances in excess of 4,000 psi, the components used in shotshell reloading must not be varied from published recipes, as the margin of safety relative to operating pressures for shotguns is much lower than for pistols and rifles. This lower operating pressure for shotguns and shells is also the reason why shotgun barrels have noticeably thinner walls than rifle and pistol barrels.

== Legal aspects ==
Since many countries heavily restrict the civilian possession of ammunition and ammunition components, including primers and smokeless powder, handloading may be explicitly or implicitly illegal in certain countries. Even without specific restrictions on powder and primers, they may be covered under other laws governing explosive materials. Handloading may require study and passing an exam to acquire a handloading permit prior to being allowed to handload ammunition in some jurisdictions. This is done to avoid catastrophic accidents caused by lack of knowledge/skill as much as possible, and also allows the government to maintain information on who reloads their own cartridges. The standards organization C.I.P. rules that the products of handloaders that do not comply with the C.I.P. ammunition approval rules for commercial ammunition manufacturers cannot be legally sold in C.I.P. member states.

Many firearms manufacturers explicitly advise against the use of handloaded ammunition. Generally, this means that the maker&#x27;s warranty is void, and the manufacturer is not liable for any damage to the gun or personal injury if handloaded ammunition is used that exceeded established limits for a particular arm. This arises because firearm manufacturers point out that while they have some influence and scope for redress with ammunition manufacturers, they have no such influence over the actions of incompetent or overly ambitious individuals who assemble ammunition.

===United States ===
In the United States, handloading is not only legal and requires no permit, but is also quite popular. Experts point to potential legal liabilities (depending on the jurisdiction) that the shooter may incur if using handloaded ammunition for defense, such as an implied malice on the part of the shooter, as the use of handloaded ammunition may give the impression that &quot;regular bullets weren&#x27;t deadly enough&quot;. Additionally, forensic reconstruction of a shooting relies on using identical ammunition from the manufacturer, where handloaded ammunition cannot be guaranteed identical to the ammunition used in the shooting, since &quot;the defendant literally manufactured the evidence&quot;. In particular, powder residue patterning is used by law enforcement to validate the distance between the firearm and the person shot using known facts from the manufacturer about powder type, content, and other factors.

===Canada ===
Handloading is legal in Canada. The Explosives Act places limits on the amount of powder (either smokeless or black) that may be stored in a building, on the manner in which it is stored, and on how much powder may be available for use at any time. The Act is the responsibility of Natural Resources Canada. If the quantity of powder stored for personal use exceeds 75 kg, then a Propellant Magazine Licence (Type P) is required. There is no limit on the number of primers that may be stored for non-commercial use.

===Germany ===
As an example of a European country, handloading in Germany requires a course, terminated in an exam, in handloading and handling of explosive propellants; often, this is offered in combination with a course and exam in muzzle-loading and black powder-shooting. The State&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior conducts the exam. When passed and the reloader can provide a reason for his will to reload (&quot;Bedürfnisprüfung&quot;), he can apply for a permit to a quota of propellant for five years (after which time he has to extend the permit). Every propellant is recorded in the permit. Primers, cartridges, bullets, and reloading equipment are available without a permit.

As German law gives maximum pressures for every commercial caliber, the handloader is allowed to non-commercially give away his ammunition. He is liable for incorrect loading. His references are data books by propellant manufacturers (like RWS), bullet manufacturers (like Speer), reloading tool manufacturers (like Lyman) or neutral manufacturers institutions like the DEVA. Firearms manufacturers give guarantees as long as the handloaded ammunition is within the correct parameters.

The relevant rules for non-commercial application can be found in §27 of the Explosives Act (&quot;Sprengstoffgesetz&quot;).

In order to investigate gun destruction – material fault or incorrectly loaded ammunition – , and for handloaders to get data for new loads, gun and/or handloaded cartridges can be sent to the DEVA institute (German institute for testing and examining of hunting and sporting guns); the DEVA returns a pressure diagram and a report whether this load is within legal range for this ammunition.

=== South Africa ===
Handloading or reloading is allowed in South Africa as long as you are in possession of a competency certificate to possess a firearm as well as a license to possess such a firearm. Sport shooters load to make shooting sports more affordable and hunters load to obtain greater accuracy. Powder and primers are strictly controlled by law and can not exceed for 2 kg for powder and 2400 primers. The amount of ammunition you may have in your possession is also limited to 200 rounds per chambering. If you are a registered dedicated sportsman, the quantities are unlimited. Although the powder&#x27;s quantity is unlimited if you are a dedicated sportsman, storage of excess amounts of powder is dangerous due to the potential of fire occurring from accidental ignition. A manual from a South African powder manufacturer Rheinmetall Denel Munition (previously Somchem) is available for reloaders with adequate information and guidelines.

== Atypical handloading ==
Berdan primers, with their off-center flash holes and lack of self-contained anvil, are more difficult to work with than the easily removed Boxer primers. The primers may be punctured and pried out from the rear, or extracted with hydraulic pressure. Primers must be selected carefully, as there are more sizes of Berdan primers than the standard large and small pistol, large and small rifle of Boxer primers. The case must also be inspected carefully to make sure the anvil has not been damaged because this could result in a failure to fire.

Rimfire cartridges (e.g. 22 Long Rifle) are not generally hand-loaded in modern times, although there are some shooters that unload commercial rimfire cartridges, and use the primed case to make their own loads or to generate special rimfire wildcat cartridges. These cartridges are highly labor-intensive to produce. Historically, liquid priming material was available for reloading rimfire ammunition, but the extreme explosive hazard of bulk primer compound and complexity of the process (including &quot;ironing out&quot; the firing pin strike) caused the practice to decline.

Some shooters desiring to reload for obsolete rimfire cartridges alter the firearm in question to function as a centerfire, which allows them to reload. Often it is possible to reform cases from similarly sized ammunition which is in production, and this is the most economical way of obtaining brass for obscure or out-of-production calibers. Even if custom brass must be manufactured, this is often far less expensive than purchasing rare, out-of-production ammunition. Cartridges like the 56-50 Spencer, for example, are not readily obtainable in rimfire form, but can be made from shortened 50-70 cartridges or even purchased in loaded form from specialty dealers.

An unusual solution to the problem of obtaining ammunition for the very old pinfire cartridges is even available. This solution uses specialized cartridges that use a removable pin and anvil which hold a percussion cap of the type use in caplock firearms. To reload a fired case, the pin is removed, allowing the anvil to slide out; a percussion cap is placed in the anvil, it is re-inserted, and the pin serves to lock the anvil in place, as well as to ignite the percussion cap.

Shotshell reloading is sometimes done for scattershot loads, consisting of multiple wads separating groups of shot, which are intended for use at short-distance hunting of birds. Similarly, shotshell reloading for buckshot loads and non-lethal &quot;bean bag&quot; loads are sometimes handloaded. These types of shotshells are rarely handloaded.

== Accuracy considerations ==
Precision and consistency are key to developing accurate ammunition. Various methods are used to ensure that ammunition components are as consistent as possible. Since the firearm is also a variable in the accuracy equation, careful tuning of the load to a particular firearm can yield significant
accuracy improvements.

===Cases===

The internal volume of the cartridge case, or case capacity, significantly affects the pressure developed during ignition, which significantly affects the velocity of the bullet. Cases from different manufacturers can vary in wall thickness, and as cases are repeatedly fired and reloaded the brass flows up to the neck and is trimmed off, increasing capacity as well as weakening the case. The first step to ensuring consistent case capacity is sorting the cases by headstamp, so each lot of cases is from the same manufacturer and/or year. A further step would be to then weigh these cases, and sort by case weight.

The neck of the case is another variable since this determines how tightly the bullet is held in place during ignition. Inconsistent neck thickness and neck tension will result in variations in pressure during ignition. These variables can be addressed by annealing and thinning the neck, as well as by careful control of the crimping operation.

===Bullets===
Bullets must be well balanced and consistent in weight, shape, and seating depth to ensure that they correctly engage the rifling, exit the barrel at a consistent velocity, and fly straight. Buying bullets from a high-quality source will help ensure quality, but for ultimate accuracy, some shooters will measure even the best bullets, and reject all but the most consistent. Measurement of the weight is the easiest, and bullets that are out of round can be detected by rotating the bullet while measuring with a micrometer. There is even a device available that will detect changes in jacket thickness and internal voids in jacketed rifle bullets, though its high cost makes it prohibitively expensive for all but the most dedicated shooters.

The transition from the case to the barrel is also very important. If the bullets have to travel a varying distance from the case to the point where they engage the rifling, then this can result in variations in pressure and velocity. The bearing surface of the bullet should ideally be seated as close as possible to the rifling. Since it is the bearing surface that matters here, it is important that the bullets have a consistent bearing surface.

===Load tuning===
Tuning load to a gun can also yield great increases in accuracy, especially for standard, non-accurized rifles. Different rifles, even of the same make and model, will often react to the same ammunition in different ways. The handloader is afforded a wider selection of bullet weights than can readily be found in commercially loaded ammunition, and there are many different powders that can be used for any given cartridge. Trying a range of bullets and a variety of powders will determine what combination of bullet and powder gives the most consistent velocities and accuracies. Careful adjustment of the amount of powder can give the velocity that best fits the natural harmonics of the barrel (see accurize and internal ballistics). For ultimate accuracy and performance, the handloader also has the option of using a wildcat cartridge; wildcats are the result of shaping the cartridge and chamber themselves to a specific end, and the results push the envelope of velocity, energy, and accuracy. Most, but not all, reloads perform best when the powder selected fills 95% or more of the case (by volume).

== Cost considerations ==
Those who reload with the primary goal of maximizing accuracy or terminal performance may end up paying more per reloaded round than for commercial ammunition—this is especially true for military calibers which are commonly available as surplus. Maximum performance, however, requires the highest quality components, which are usually the most expensive. Reloaders who reload with the primary goal of saving money on ammunition, however, can make a few tradeoffs to realize significant cost savings with a minimal sacrifice in quality.

===Case life maximization===

Since the case is the single most expensive part of a loaded round, the more times a case can be re-used, the better. Cases that are loaded to a moderate pressure will generally last longer, as they will not be work hardened or flow under pressure as much as cases loaded to higher pressures. Use of moderate pressure loads extends the life of the case significantly, not to mention saving quite a bit of wear and tear on the barrel. Work hardening can cause cracks to occur in the neck as the hardened brass loses its malleability, and is unable to survive swaging back into shape during the resizing operation. Rifle brass tends to flow towards the neck (this is why rifle brass must be trimmed periodically) and this takes brass away from the rear of the case. Eventually, this will show as a bright ring near the base of the cartridge, just in front of the thick web of brass at the base. If brass is used after this ring appears, it risks a crack, or worse, a complete head separation, which will leave the forward portion of the brass lodged in the chamber of the gun. This generally requires a special stuck case removal tool to extract, so it is very undesirable to have a head separation.

With bottlenecked cartridge cases, choosing the right sizing die can also be important. Full-length sizing of cartridges is often thought to greatly shorten case life by work hardening the full length of the case, which can cause the case neck to split, although some studies show that the number of reloads possible with a case is essentially the same for either full length sizing as for neck sizing only if the issue is one of neck hardening. If the reloaded cartridges are going to be used in the same firearm in which they were previously fired, though, and if that firearm has a bolt action or other action with a strong camming action on closing, then full-length resizing may not be needed. A collet neck sizing die can be used to size just the case neck enough to hold the bullet and leave the rest of the case unsized. The resulting cartridge will chamber into the specific rifle that previously fired it, though the fit might be tight and require more force to chamber than a full-length resized case. The use of a neck-sizing die in conjunction with moderate pressure loads may extend the life of the case significantly by minimizing the amount of case that is work hardened or stretched. This is especially true for reloads intended for military rifles with intentionally large chambers such as the Lee–Enfield in .303 British. The use of partial length or neck sizing for cartridges used in such large chambers permits effectively switching the headspacing from relying on the rim of a rimmed cartridge to the shoulder of the bottleneck transition instead, increasing the number of times a rimmed military cartridge can be reloaded from once to perhaps 5 or more times, all while avoiding dangerous incipient head separations. One final form of limiting case wear is limited strictly to benchrest shooters with custom-cut chambers. The chamber of these rifles is cut so that there is just enough room, typically just a few thousandths of an inch, in the neck area. The result of using this type of chamber is that fired rounds do not require any resizing whatsoever once the case is fired. The brass will &#x27;spring back&#x27; a bit after firing, and will properly hold a new bullet without further manipulation. Some refer to this as a &#x27;fitted&#x27; neck, however, it is a function of both the carefully cut precision neck and the case adjusted to fit with very little clearance.

Work hardening happens to all cases, even low-pressure handgun cases. The sudden increase in pressure upon firing hits the brass like a hammer, changing its crystalline structure and making it more brittle. The neck of the case, if it becomes too brittle, will be incapable of standing the strain of resizing, expanding, crimping, and firing, and will split during loading or firing. Since the case neck remains in tension while holding the bullet in place, aging ammunition may develop split necks in storage. While a neck split during firing is not a significant danger, a split neck will render the case incapable of holding the bullet in place, so the case must be discarded or recycled as a wildcat cartridge of shorter overall length, allowing the split section to be removed. The simplest way to decrease the effects of work hardening is to decrease the pressure in the case. Loading to the minimum power level listed in the reloading manual, instead of the maximum, can significantly increase case life. Slower powders generally also have lower pressure peaks and may be a good choice.

Annealing brass to make it softer and less brittle is fairly easy, but annealing cartridge cases is a more complex matter. Since the base of the case must be hard, it cannot be annealed. What is needed is a form of heat treatment called differential hardening, where heat is carefully applied to part of the case until the desired softness is reached, and then the heat treatment process is halted by rapidly cooling the case. Since annealing brass requires heating it to about 660 °F (350 °C), the heating must be done in such a way as to heat the neck to that temperature, while preventing the base of the case from being heated and losing its hardness. The traditional way is to stand the cases in a shallow pan full of water, then heat the necks of the cases with a torch, but this method makes it difficult to get an even heating of the entire case neck. A temperature-sensitive crayon can be used at the point to which it is to be annealed, which is just behind the shoulder for bottlenecked cartridges, or at the bottom of the bullet seating depth for straight-wall cartridges. The neck of the case is placed in a propane torch flame and heated it until the crayon mark changes color, indicating the correct temperature. Once the correct temperature is reached the case is completely quenched in water to stop the annealing process at the desired hardness. Failing to keep the base of the case cool can anneal the case near the head, where it must remain hard to function properly. Another approach is to immerse the case mouth in a molten alloy of lead that is at the desired annealing temperature for a few seconds, then quickly shake off the lead and quench the case.

Cases that have small cracks at the neck may not be a complete loss. Many cartridges, both commercial and wildcats, can be made by shortening a longer cartridge. For example, a 223 Remington can be shortened to become a .222 Remington, which can further be shortened to become a .221 Fireball. Similarly, .30-06 Springfield can become .308 Winchester, which can become any number of specialized benchrest shooting cartridges. Since the cracking is likely due to a brittle neck, the cases should be annealed before attempting to reform them, or the crack may propagate and ruin the newly formed shorter case as well.

=== Powder cost minimization ===
Powder is another significant cost of reloading, and one over which the handloader has significant control. In addition to the obvious step of using a minimum charge, rather than a full power one, significant cost savings may be obtained through careful powder choice. Given the same bullet and cartridge, a faster burning powder will generally use a smaller charge of powder than required with a slower powder. For example, a 44 Magnum firing a 240-grain lead semi-wadcutter could be loaded with either Accurate Arms #2, a very fast pistol powder, or #9, a very slow pistol powder. When using the minimum loads, 9.0 grains (0.58 g) of AA #2 yield a velocity of 1126 ft/s (343 m/s), and 19.5 grains (1.26 g) of #9 yield 1364 ft/s (416 m/s). For the same amount of powder, AA #2 can produce approximately twice as many rounds, yet both powders cost the same per weight.

The tradeoff comes in terms of power and accuracy; AA #2 is designed for small cases and will burn inconsistently in the large 44 Magnum case. AA #9, however, will fill the case much better, and the slow burn rate of AA #9 is ideal for magnum handgun rounds, producing 20% higher velocities (at maximum levels) while still producing less pressure than the fast-burning AA #2. A medium-burning powder might actually be a better choice, as it could split the difference in powder weights while delivering more power and accuracy than the fastest powder.

One solution that is applicable to revolvers, in particular, is the possibility of using a reduced-volume case. Cartridges such as 357 Magnum and 44 Magnum are just longer versions of their parent rounds of .38 Special and .44 Special, and the shorter rounds will fire in the longer chambers with no problems. The reduced case capacity allows greater accuracy with even lighter loads. A 44 Special loaded with a minimum load of AA #2 uses only 4.2 grains (0.27 g) of powder, and produces a modest 771 ft/s (235 m/s).

When reloading .38 Special and .44 Special, extreme care must be exercised to not exceed maximum powder specifications - i.e. a 357 Magnum load must never be used in a .38 special case, as even though the powder charge may fit, the difference in case volumes will likely create an overpressure scenario resulting in unsafe conditions.

== Bullets ==

While the case is usually the most expensive component of a cartridge, the bullet is usually the most expensive part of the &quot;reloaded&quot; round, especially with handgun ammunition. It is also the best place to save money with handgun ammunition. This is because the bullets are used one time, and the case lasts for many reloadings.

Other advantages of casting or swaging bullets from lead wire (which is pricier but avoids many quality-control issues of casting) is the ability to precisely control many attributes of the resulting bullet. Custom bullet molds are available from a number of sources, allowing the handloader to pick the exact weight, shape, and diameter of the bullet to fit the cartridge, firearm, and intended use. A good example of where this is useful is for shooters of older military surplus firearms, which often exhibit widely varying bore and groove diameters; by making bullets specifically intended for the firearm in question, the accuracy of the resulting cartridges can be significantly increased.

=== Casting ===
For the truly frugal, the cheapest method of obtaining bullets, buckshot, and slugs intended for reloading use at low to moderate velocities is casting them.

This requires a set of bullet, buckshot, or slug molds, which are available from a number of sources, and a source of known quality lead. Linotype and automotive wheelweights are often used as sources of lead that are blended together in a molten state to achieve the desired Brinell hardness. Other sources of scrap lead, such as recovered bullets, lead cable sheathing, lead pipe, or even lead–acid battery plates (EXTREME caution should be used as modern battery components, when melted, can yield hazardous, even deadly gases), can yield usable lead with some degree of effort, including purification and measuring of hardness.

Cast bullets are also the cheapest bullets to buy, though generally only handgun bullets are available in this form. Some firearms manufacturers, such as those using polygonal rifling like Glock and H&amp;K, advise against the use of cast bullets. For shooters who would like to shoot cast bullets, aftermarket barrels are generally available for these models with conventional rifling, and the cost of the barrel can generally be recouped in ammunition savings after a few thousand rounds.

Soft lead bullets are generally used in handguns with velocities of 1000 ft/s (300 m/s) or lower, while harder cast bullets may be used, with careful powder selection, in rifles with velocities of 2000 ft/s (600 m/s) or slightly more. A modern solution to velocity limitations of cast projectiles is to powder coat the projectile, encasing it in a protective skin allowing higher velocities to be achieved with softer lead alloys with no lead build up in the firearm. The limit is the point at which the powder gas temperature and pressure starts to melt the base of the bullet, and leave a thin coating of molten and re-solidified lead in the bore of the gun—a process called leading the bore. Cast lead bullets may also be fired in full power magnum handgun rounds like the 44 Magnum with the addition of a gas check, which is a thin aluminum, zinc or copper washer or cup that is crimped over a tiny heel on the base of appropriate cast bullets. This provides protection for the base of the bullet, and allows velocities of over 1500 ft/s (450 m/s) in handguns, with little or no leading of the bore.

Such cast lead bullets, intended for use with a gas check, will have a reduced diameter at the rear of the cast lead bullet, onto which the gas check can be swaged using a lubricating/resizing press. All cast lead bullets, whether with or without a gas check, must still be lubricated, to prevent leading of the rifling of the barrel. A lubricating/resizing press, which is a special purpose bullet processing press, can be either a standalone press dedicated to lubricating and resizing bullets, or can be an add-on to a reloading press, at the option of the handloader. Not all handloaders resize cast lead bullets, although all handloaders do lubricate cast lead bullets. An option to using a lubricating press is simply to coat the bullets with bullet lube, which can be done either with a spray, in a tumbler, in a plastic bowel with a liquid lube, in a tray with melted bullet lube, or even with a manual lubricating process.

Slugs for shotgun shells are also commonly cast from pure lead by handloaders, for subsequent reloading into shotgun shells. Although roll crimps of shotgun hull cases are commonly used for handloading these cast lead slugs, in place of the fold crimps that are used when reloading shot into shotgun shells, some published recipes specifically do include fold crimps. For published recipes using fold crimps and shot wads used as sabots, slugs can be easily reloaded using standard shotshell presses and techniques, without requiring any roll crimp tools. Whether roll crimps or fold crimps are used, cast lead slugs are commonly used in jurisdictions where rifles are banned for hunting, under the reasoning that fired slugs will not travel but over short distances, unlike rifle bullets which can travel up to several miles when fired. Use of cast lead slugs is therefore very common when hunting large game near populated areas.

Similarly, cast lead buckshot is often cast by handloaders, for reloading into shotgun shells for hunting larger game animals. Such buckshot is then placed by hand into shotgun shells when handloaded, due to the necessity of having to stack the buckshot balls into specific configurations depending on the gauge of shotgun shell being reloaded, the choice of wad, the volume of powder, and the size of the buckshot (e.g., 00, 000, 0000 buckshot). Such cast lead buckshot is never simply dropped from a shotshell press charge bar into a shotgun shell when reloading.

=== Swaging ===

Most shooters prefer jacketed bullets, especially in rifles and pistols. The hard jacket material, generally copper or brass, resists deformation and handles far higher pressures and temperatures than lead. Several companies offer swaging presses (both manual and hydraulic) that will manufacture on a small scale jacketed bullets that can rival or surpass the quality of commercial jacketed bullets. Two swaging equipment manufacturers offer equipment and dies designed to turn 22 Long Rifle cases into brass jackets for 22 caliber (5.56 mm) bullets.

Example variants of swage dies include:

* &quot;R dies&quot;, used for bullet swaging in the reloading press. No expensive special press is needed; however, the reloading press cannot swage all calibers and variants of bullets.
* &quot;S dies&quot;, steel dies for a manual press. They have a maximum caliber of and a maximum jacket length of .
* &quot;H dies&quot;, dies designed for hydraulic presses and are offered in calibers up to and jacket lengths of more than 1.3&quot;. In a hydraulic press, bullets from powdered metal can be swaged.

Every bullet diameter, and most of the bullet types, need special dies, making swaging a rather investment-intensive enterprise.

===Purchased Bullets===
Handloaders have the choice to swage but most choose to purchase pre-made jacketed bullets, due to the obscure nature of swaging and the specialized, expensive equipment. The process of manufacturing a jacketed bullet is far more complex than for a cast bullet; first, the jacket must be punched from a metal sheet of precise thickness, filled with a premeasured lead core, and then swaged into shape with a high pressure press in multiple steps. This involved process makes jacketed bullets far more expensive on average than cast bullets. Further complicating this are the requirements for controlled expansion bullets (see terminal ballistics), which require a tight bond between the jacket and the core. Premium expanding bullets are, with match grade bullets, at the top tier in expense.

=== Plated Bullets ===

A more economical alternative was made available to the handloader in the 1980s, the copper-plated bullet. Copper-plated bullets are lead bullets that are electroplated with a copper jacket. While thinner than a swaged bullet jacket, the plated jacket is far thicker than normal electroplate, and provides significant structural integrity to the bullet. Since the jacket provides the strength, soft lead can be used, which allows bullets to be swaged or cast into shape before plating. While not strong enough for most rifle cartridges, plated bullets work well in many handgun rounds, with a recommended maximum velocity of 1250 ft/s (375 m/s). Plated bullets fall between cast and traditional jacketed bullets in price.

While originally sold only to handloaders as an inexpensive substitute for jacketed bullets, the plated bullet has come far. The ammunition manufacturer Speer now offers the Gold Dot line, commercially loaded premium handgun ammunition using copper-plated hollow point bullets. The strong bond between jacket and core created by the electroplating process makes expanding bullets hold together very well, and the Gold Dot line is now in use by many police departments.

<text>The Houston Texans are a professional American football team based in Houston. The Texans compete in the National Football League as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) South division. The team plays its home games at NRG Stadium.

The Texans were founded in 1999, replacing the city&#x27;s previous NFL franchise, the Houston Oilers, who played from 1960 to 1996 before moving to Nashville and eventually becoming the Tennessee Titans. The Texans began play as an expansion team in , making them the youngest franchise currently competing in the NFL.

While the Texans mainly struggled in the 2000s, their fortunes would take a turn for the better in the 2010s when they won their first division championship in 2011, clinching their first playoff berth. The Texans have gone on to win seven more AFC South division championships in 2012, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2023, and 2024. They are the only franchise to have never won a road playoff game along with the only one to have never appeared in a conference championship game; they are also one of four franchises to have never appeared in a Super Bowl, alongside the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, and division rival Jacksonville Jaguars.

Bob McNair owned the Texans until his death in 2018, after which the majority ownership of the team went to his wife, Janice. The McNairs&#x27; son, Cal, became operating head of the franchise upon his father&#x27;s death, and became principal owner when his mother transferred ownership to him in 2024. According to an article by &quot;Forbes,&quot; the Houston Texans are the eleventh richest team in the NFL with a value of $4.7 billion in August 2022.

After the Texas Rangers won the 2023 World Series, the Houston Texans became the only big four professional sports franchise currently based in Texas without a championship.

==History==

In 1997, Houston entrepreneur Bob McNair had a failed bid to bring a National Hockey League (NHL) expansion team to the city, and Bud Adams relocated the city&#x27;s NFL team, the Houston Oilers, to Nashville, Tennessee, where they were renamed the Tennessee Titans in 1999. In 1996, the Cleveland Browns had controversially relocated to become the Baltimore Ravens. As part of the settlement between the NFL, the city of Cleveland, and the team owned by Art Modell, the league promised to return football to Cleveland within the next three years.

In order to even out the franchises to 32, the NFL contemplated adding another expansion franchise. As Houston was one of the favorites for the extra franchise, along with Toronto and Los Angeles (the latter of whom had lost the Rams and the Raiders in 1995), McNair then decided to join the football project and founded Houston NFL Holdings with partner Steve Patterson. With Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, they would push for a domed stadium as part of the bid to lure the NFL back to Houston. On October 6, 1999, the NFL awarded the 32nd team to Houston at a cost of $700 million.

=== McNair family era (2002–present) ===
The Houston Texans joined the NFL in the 2002 season, playing at the newly opened Reliant Stadium under head coach Dom Capers. With their opening game victory over the Dallas Cowboys on September 8, 2002, the Texans became the first expansion team to win its opening game since the Minnesota Vikings beat the Chicago Bears in 1961. The Texans went 4–12 and finished last in the AFC South in their debut season. The team improved to a 5–11 mark in the 2003 season. The team continued to make progress with a 7–9 record in the 2004 season. In the 2005 season, the Texans fell to a 2–14 record for the worst mark in the league. Following the end of the season, the team fired Capers as head coach. They earned the top pick in the 2006 NFL Draft.

==== Gary Kubiak years (2006–2013) ====
While the team struggled in its early seasons, results began to improve when native Houstonian Gary Kubiak became the head coach in 2006. The Texans finished with a .500 season (8–8) in 2007 and 2008, and nearly qualified for the 2009–10 playoffs with a 9–7 result in 2009. The Texans started the 2010 season on a 4–2 record going into a Week 7 bye week, but promptly collapsed 2–8 in the second half of the season, finishing 6–10. In the 2011 NFL draft, the Texans acquired Wisconsin star defensive end J. J. Watt 11th overall. The following season, former Cowboys head coach Wade Phillips was hired as the defensive coordinator for the Texans, and the improved defense led to them finishing 10–6, winning their first AFC South title. The Texans then beat wild card Cincinnati Bengals 31–10 in the first round of the 2011–12 playoffs, before a 20–13 defeat by the Ravens in the Divisional Round.
The Texans surged as the team to beat in the AFC South in , starting 5–0 and holding an 11–1 record by week 14. However, they lost three of their last four games to finish 12–4; beating the rival Indianapolis Colts in that four-game stretch allowing them to clinch their 2nd AFC South title. The Texans beat the Bengals again in the wild-card round, but they lost in the Divisional Round to the New England Patriots.

In the 2013 NFL draft, the Texans acquired Clemson wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins 27th overall. In 2013, the Texans started 2–0 but went into a tailspin and lost every game afterwards. Kubiak was fired as head coach after being swept by the rival Jacksonville Jaguars, who themselves started 0–8. Wade Phillips filled in as head coach, but the Texans&#x27; poor form did not change, and they finished 2–14, tying, with 2005, their worst record in franchise history. The 14-game losing streak is the worst in franchise history.

==== Bill O&#x27;Brien years (2014–2020) ====
The Texans entered the 2014 season with a 14-game losing streak. Former Penn State head coach Bill O&#x27;Brien became the Texans&#x27; new head coach, and the third in franchise history, during the offseason. In 2014, the Texans won three of their first four games, defeating the Redskins in the season opener while ending the losing streak, the Raiders, and the Bills, losing to the New York Giants. They lost three of their next four games, losing to the Dallas Cowboys, the Indianapolis Colts, and the Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively. The Texans went on to finish 9–7 in the 2014 season and barely missed the playoffs.

In the 2015 season, they were featured on HBO, on the show &quot;Hard Knocks&quot;. That year, the Texans started with a 2–5 record. Quarterback Ryan Mallett was released amidst controversy regarding his benching in favor of Brian Hoyer during a loss against the Indianapolis Colts. After a poor start, the Texans finished with a 9–7 record and won their third AFC South title. However, they were shut out by the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card round 30–0, ending their championship hopes for the year.

On March 9, 2016, the Texans signed former Denver Broncos quarterback Brock Osweiler to a 4-year, $72 million deal. Despite Osweiler&#x27;s lucrative deal, he struggled significantly during the 2016 season. After throwing two interceptions in Week 15 against the Jaguars, coach Bill O&#x27;Brien benched the offseason acquisition in favor of backup quarterback Tom Savage. Savage led a comeback effort against the Jaguars, and was named the starter for the remainder of the season. The Texans clinched their fourth AFC South division title in six years in Savage&#x27;s first career start against the Bengals in Week 16. They defeated the wildcard Oakland Raiders 27–14 in the opening round of the playoffs with Osweiler as the starting quarterback due to Savage being out with a concussion. Osweiler started in the Divisional Playoffs game against the New England Patriots, throwing three interceptions in the second half. The Texans lost 34–16.

In the 2017 NFL draft, the Texans traded up to the 12th overall selection to select Clemson star quarterback Deshaun Watson. Watson started six games his rookie year, going 3–3 and having arguably the greatest and most decorated rookie season by a quarterback in NFL history, eventually rising up to become the Texans&#x27; franchise quarterback. However, his success would come up very short, following a Week 8 41–38 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Watson tore his ACL in practice and was ruled out the remainder of the season, which caused the Texans to have one of their worst seasons. Plagued by a series of unexpected injuries (including a second consecutive season-ending injury to J. J. Watt) and controversy involving the team&#x27;s suspected violation of the league&#x27;s concussion protocol, after backup quarterback Tom Savage suffered a seizure following a Week 14 game against the San Francisco 49ers, the Texans went 1–9 the rest of the season and eventually finish 4–12 and last in the AFC South in 2017, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014 and giving Bill O&#x27;Brien his first losing season as Texans head coach.
In 2018, the Texans started the season 0–3, losing by a combined 15 points to the New England Patriots, Tennessee Titans, and New York Giants, before winning a 37–34 overtime shootout on the road in Indianapolis. This win sparked a nine-game winning streak for the Texans, their first since starting 5–0 in 2012, which included a Week 8 win against the Miami Dolphins that included five touchdown passes from Deshaun Watson. This streak was the longest ever for a team that started the season 0–3; the previous record was a seven-game win-streak set by the New York Giants in 1918 after starting out 0–3.

On November 23, 2018, the owner of the Houston Texans, Bob McNair, died from skin cancer. On November 26, 2018, McNair&#x27;s wife, Janice McNair, became the principal owner and Senior Chair of the Houston Texans, while their son, D. Cal McNair, became the chairman and Chief Operating Officer.

The Texans finished the season 11–5, and won another AFC South division championship under Bill O&#x27;Brien. They lost 21–7 in the first round of the playoffs to their AFC South division rival Indianapolis Colts.

In 2019, the Texans won the AFC South division championship and qualified for the NFL playoffs on the back of a 10–6 record. They went on to defeat the Buffalo Bills by a score of 22–19 in overtime in the AFC wild-card round. However, the Texans&#x27; 2019 season came to an end the following week, as they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 51–31 in the AFC divisional round. The Texans had a 24–0 lead in the game before the Chiefs came back.

On March 22, 2020, the Texans traded away all-pro wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft to the Arizona Cardinals. In return, Houston received running back David Johnson, a 2020 second-round pick, and a 2021 fourth-round pick. The move was confusing and controversial among fans and sportswriters alike, as many claimed that the Texans should have received more valuable assets for Hopkins, who was among the best receivers in the NFL.

The Texans began the 2020 NFL season with a record of 0–4, and Bill O&#x27;Brien was consequentially fired following a disappointing loss to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 4. Romeo Crennel, who was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns from 2005 to 2008 and of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2011–12, was named the interim head coach for the remainder of the season. Crennel managed to win more than half of his first 7 games as Houston&#x27;s head coach, giving Houston a record of 4–7. However, the Texans ended the season on a five-game losing streak. With a final record of 4–12, the Texans were unable to make the playoffs.

==== Rebuilding years (2021–2022) ====

On January 27, 2021, the Texans hired David Culley as the team&#x27;s head coach. Culley most recently worked as the Baltimore Ravens assistant head coach, wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator. On February 12, 2021, the Texans released all-pro defensive end J.J. Watt. It was confirmed that Watt personally requested owner Cal McNair for his release.

On January 13, 2022, the Texans fired David Culley after posting a 4–13 record as the team&#x27;s head coach and promoted defensive coordinator Lovie Smith as the team&#x27;s fifth head coach on February 7, 2022. The team traded away their starting quarterback Deshaun Watson to the Cleveland Browns and a 2024 fifth round pick for three 1st round picks, a 3rd round pick and a 4th round pick on March 20, 2022, due to sexual misconduct lawsuits toward Watson. The Texans opened their 2022 season in a tie game against the Indianapolis Colts, the franchise&#x27;s first tie in their 20-year existence. On January 9, 2023, the Texans announced that they were going in a different direction by firing Lovie Smith after a 3–13–1 season.

====Ryans and Stroud era (2023–present)====

On January 31, 2023, the Texans hired former player and 49ers defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans as their new head coach, making him the sixth head coach in franchise history. In the 2023 NFL draft the Texans selected Ohio State quarterback C. J. Stroud and traded up to the third pick to select Defensive End Will Anderson Jr.. Under Ryans and Stroud, the team saw improved fortunes as they made the playoffs while winning the AFC South for the first time since the 2019 season with a 10–7 record, becoming the first NFL team to win their division under a rookie head coach and quarterback. The team defeated the Cleveland Browns 45–14 in the Wild Card Round. The Texans saw their season end in the Divisional Round with a 34–10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Stroud would later be named NFL offensive Rookie of the Year, and Anderson Jr. would be named NFL defensive Rookie of the Year Award. Ryans also finished in a tie in total votes for NFL Coach of the Year with Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski though he lost the award in a tiebreaker due to having one less first place vote.

==Rivalries==
The Texans are the youngest expansion team in the NFL, having only been competing in the NFL for 23 seasons since 2002 and have had limited regular season and postseason success. For that reason, they have not had the history or the reputation on which to build classic rivalries like the ones that often exist between older franchises. Despite this, the team has developed some rivalries. Its natural rivals are its fellow AFC South teams, which are the Tennessee Titans, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Indianapolis Colts.

===Divisional===
====Tennessee Titans====
The Tennessee Titans, who were formerly the Houston Oilers before their relocation in 1996, are viewed by many Houston fans as the Texans&#x27; chief rival as members of the AFC South ever since the early 2000s. Houstonians have grown their distaste for the Titans due to former owner Bud Adams and his family keeping the rights to the Oilers name and colors. Many Houston fans argue that the history of the Oilers belong to the City of Houston, relating in and out of sports; For example, Houston Police cars used don the iconic Colombia blue and red colors associated with the Oilers, and the “Oilers” namesake relates directly to Houston’s role in the Oil and Gas Industry. In 2023, Tennessee unveiled Oilers Throwback Uniforms, which they wore to play the Texans. As of 2025, the Titans still occasionally use these uniforms. As of the 2023 season, the Titans lead the all-time series 23–21.

====Indianapolis Colts====

Ever since the early 2000s, the Texans also have an AFC South Division rivalry with the Indianapolis Colts, whom the Texans had not defeated until the 2006 season. The first time that the Texans would sweep the Colts was in the 2016 NFL season. More recently, Houston has increased bitterness with the Indianapolis Colts due to their young Houston-native quarterback Andrew Luck having been drafted by the Colts in 2012 and the franchise&#x27;s first ever sweep of the Colts against Luck in 2016. In 2018 the two teams met in the AFC Wild Card Playoffs, with the Colts winning 21–7.

====Jacksonville Jaguars====

Having begun play in 1995 and 2002, respectively, the Jaguars and Texans are among two of the most-recently established franchises in the NFL. The Jaguars relocated from the AFC Central to the newly created AFC South where the Texans were placed into and have competed as division rivals since. The Jaguars are the only division rival the Texans have a winning record against as the Texans lead the series 29–15.

===Inter Conference===
====Dallas Cowboys====
The Texans also have an intrastate/interconference rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys, with whom they contest the so-called Governor&#x27;s Cup every year (a tradition started between the cities prior to the Oilers relocating) either in the preseason or the regular season for bragging rights in the state of Texas. In 2017, the destruction and flooding caused during Hurricane Harvey a few days before their Week 4 pre-season match up time scheduled caused the game to be relocated to AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. However, out of concern for the safety of the fans and the condition of the player&#x27;s families &amp; communities, the game was canceled. As of the 2024 season, the Cowboys lead the all-time series 4–3.

==Culture==
The Texans are the newest team in the league, but they have been embraced by a fair amount of celebrities since joining the NFL in 2002. The team has also adopted a number of former Houston Oilers fans in search of a new home team. Despite the lacking playoff success, there have been a present amount of loyal fans and even various celebrities such as Ryan Trahan, George Foreman, Paul Wall, Rico Rodriguez, and Raini Rodriguez who have been strong supporters of the team. During the 2010s, the team adopted the moniker &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot; in honor of the Rage Against the Machine song, regularly used prior to the team&#x27;s introduction before entering the field.

==Team identity==

===Name===
In the process of naming the new franchise leadership conducted an extensive review and research process; the final list of names was determined after several months of research conducted jointly by Houston NFL 2002 and NFL Properties. This included an online survey asking fans and the community to weigh in which received more than 65,000 responses in one week. On March 2, 2000, it was announced that the team name search had been narrowed down to five choices: Apollos, Bobcats, Stallions, Texans, and Wildcatters.

On September 6, 2000, the NFL&#x27;s 32nd franchise was officially christened the Houston Texans before thousands at a downtown rally in Houston. McNair explained that the name and logo were chosen to &quot;embody the pride, strength, independence and achievement that make the people of Houston and our area special.&quot; The name &quot;Texans&quot; had been used by several now-defunct football teams, including the Canadian Football League franchise in San Antonio; the World Football League franchise in Houston, which moved to Louisiana to become the Shreveport Steamer; the Dallas Texans of the NFL which played in only the 1952 season; and by the precursor of the present-day Kansas City Chiefs, when they were the second incarnation of the Dallas Texans in the American Football League (AFL). Owner Bob McNair received permission from Chiefs&#x27; owner Lamar Hunt to use the Texans name for his new team. It is also a subtle homage to the naming style of the NHL team the Montreal Canadiens who also named their team after their respective demonym.

===Logo and uniforms===
Along with the team name, McNair unveiled the team logo, an abstract depiction of a bull&#x27;s head, split in such a way to resemble the flag of Texas and the state of Texas, including a lone star to stand for the eye, the five points of which representing pride, courage, strength, tradition and independence. McNair described the colors as &quot;Deep Steel Blue&quot;, &quot;Battle Red&quot; and &quot;Liberty White&quot;. A year later the Texans unveiled their uniforms during another downtown rally.

The Texans&#x27; helmet is dark blue with the Texans bull logo. The helmet was initially white when the team name and logo were unveiled, but was later changed to dark blue. The uniform design consists of red trim and either dark blue or white jerseys. The team typically wears white pants with its blue jerseys and blue pants with its white jerseys. Starting with the 2006 season, the Texans wore all-white for their home opener, and the team began to wear an all-blue combination for home games vs. the Indianapolis Colts. In 2003, the Texans introduced an alternative red jersey with blue trim; they wear this jersey at one home game each year, usually against a division rival. In 2007, the Texans introduced red pants for the first time, pairing them with the red jerseys for an all-red look. They would wear this look until 2010, but was brought back in 2023. In October 2008 the Texans paired blue socks (instead of the traditional red) with their blue pants and white jerseys, eventually becoming the team&#x27;s primary road uniform combination. In 2016, the Texans unveiled a new uniform combo against the Jacksonville Jaguars, pairing the red jersey with blue pants and red socks. In 2017, the Texans unveiled a Color Rush uniform, using an all-blue uniform but with minimal white elements. In 2021, the Texans began sporting all-white socks on select home and road games. In 2022, the Texans began using a red alternate helmet with the red uniform. In 2023, the red alternate helmet was worn with the Color Rush uniform in a 21–16 victory against the Arizona Cardinals.

In 2002, the team wore a patch commemorating their inaugural season. Also, they celebrated 10 years as a franchise by wearing an anniversary patch throughout 2012. From 2018 to 2019, the Texans wore a memorial patch to honor Bob McNair after his death.

In April 2024, the Texans unveiled redesigned uniforms. The primary dark blue helmets remained, but the home blue uniforms were updated to include the Texans primary crest on the sleeve and new collar stripes, while the road white uniform featured blue and red horn stripes on the sleeves, along with blue numbers with red trim. The white uniform&#x27;s design also served as the basis for the red alternate uniform, which is paired with a red helmet containing the blue horn stripes. A second alternate uniform is a navy blue base with &quot;H-Town blue&quot; accents; numbers are red with &quot;H-Town blue&quot; trim. This set is paired with a navy blue alternate helmet containing the &quot;H-Star&quot; decal in &quot;H-Town blue&quot; with red trim. The inclusion of a second alternate helmet is due to the NFL allowing teams with new uniforms to unveil these helmets in advance this season.

In 2017, the 15th annual Houston Texans Charity Golf Classic raised more than $380,000 for the Foundation. More than $27.2 million has been raised for the Foundation since its creation in 2002.

Former Texans DE J. J. Watt raised $41.6 million in relief funds for Hurricane Harvey after the storm devastated the city in 2017. Watt ended up winning the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award that season.

<doc id="13865" wikidata="Q2894680" url="?curid=13865" title="Heart of Oak">
<text>&quot;Heart of Oak&quot; is the official march of the Royal Navy. It is also the official march of several Commonwealth navies, including the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal New Zealand Navy. It was the official march of the Royal Australian Navy, but has now been replaced by the new march, &quot;Royal Australian Navy&quot;. As of late 2024, the Royal Canadian Navy is seeking an alternative official march &quot;after deciding the lyrics, which celebrate British military victories in the colonial era and sing of men but not women, are disrespectful and outdated.&quot;

The music of &quot;Heart of Oak&quot; was written in 1759 by composer William Boyce, the lyrics by actor David Garrick, for Garrick&#x27;s pantomime &quot;Harlequin&#x27;s Invasion&quot;, to which others contributed as well. The pantomime was first performed on New Year&#x27;s Eve of that year at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, with Handel soloist Samuel Thomas Champnes singing &quot;Heart of Oak&quot;.

The &quot;wonderful year&quot; referenced in the first verse was the Annus Mirabilis of 1759, during which British forces were victorious in several significant battles: the Battle of Minden on 1 August 1759; the Battle of Lagos on 19 August 1759; the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (outside Quebec City) on 13 September 1759; and the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. The last battle foiled a French invasion project planned by the Duc de Choiseul to defeat Britain during the Seven Years&#x27; War, hence the reference in the song to &#x27;flat-bottom&#x27; invasion barges. These victories were followed a few months later by the Battle of Wandiwash in India on 22 January 1760. Britain&#x27;s continued success in the war boosted the song&#x27;s popularity.

The oak in the song&#x27;s title refers to the wood from which British warships were generally made during the age of sail. The &quot;Heart of oak&quot; is the strongest central wood of the tree. The reference to &quot;freemen not slaves&quot; echoes the refrain (&quot;Britons never will be slaves!&quot;) of &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;, written and composed two decades earlier.

The first verse and chorus of this version of the song is heard in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (Season 3, Episode 18 &quot;Allegiance&quot;), sung in Ten Forward by Patrick Stewart, in-character as an alien doppelgänger of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Both are also sung by Peter Ustinov and Dean Jones in the 1968 Disney movie &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Ghost&quot;.

==Lyrics==
===Original===
The song was written for the London stage in 1759 by William Boyce with words by David Garrick:

Come cheer up, my lads! &#x27;tis to glory we steer,
To add something more to this wonderful year;
To honour we call you, as free men not slaves,
For who are so free as the sons of the waves?

&quot;Chorus&quot;:
Heart of oak are our ships, heart of oak are our men;
We always are ready, steady, boys, steady!
We&#x27;ll fight and we&#x27;ll conquer again and again.
===Amended words===

Come, cheer up, my lads, &#x27;tis to glory we steer,
To add something new to this wonderful year;
To honour we call you, as freemen not slaves,
For who are so free as the sons of the waves?

&quot;Chorus&quot;:
Heart of Oak are our ships, 
Jolly Tars are our men, 
We always are ready: Steady, boys, Steady! 
We&#x27;ll fight and we&#x27;ll conquer again and again.

We ne&#x27;er see our foes but we wish them to stay,
They never see us but they wish us away;
If they run, why we follow, and run them ashore,
For if they won&#x27;t fight us, what can we do more?

(&quot;Chorus&quot;)

They say they&#x27;ll invade us, these terrible foes,
They frighten our women, our children, our beaus,
But if they in their flat-bottoms, in darkness set oar,
Still Britons they&#x27;ll find to receive them on shore.

(&quot;Chorus&quot;)

We still make them fear and we still make them flee,
And drub them ashore as we drub them at sea,
Then cheer up me lads with one heart let us sing,
Our soldiers and sailors, our statesmen and king.

(&quot;Chorus&quot;)

Alternative first verse:
Come, cheer up, my lads, &#x27;tis to glory we steer,
With heads carried high, we will banish all fear;
To honour we call you, as freemen not slaves,
For who are so free as the sons of the waves?

Alternative last verse:
Britannia triumphant her ships rule the seas,
Her watchword is &#x27;Justice&#x27; her password is &#x27;Free&#x27;,
So come cheer up my lads, with one heart let us sing,
Our soldiers, our sailors, our statesmen, our King [Queen].
===Royal Canadian Navy===

Come, cheer up, my lads, &#x27;tis to glory we steer,
To add something new to this wonderful year;
To honour we call you, not press you like slaves,
For who are so free as the sons of the waves?

&quot;Chorus&quot;:
Heart of Oak are our ships, 
Jolly Tars are our men, 
We always are ready: Steady, boys, steady! 
We&#x27;ll fight and we&#x27;ll conquer again and again.
===French lyrics (Royal Canadian Sea Cadets)===

Debout mes gaillards, pointons-nous vers la gloire,
Fleurons ajoutons à ces heures sans déboire
Sans carcans et sans joug,
Tout l&#x27;honneur nous attend,
Pour nous qui sommes les fils libres de l&#x27;océan.

Coeur de chêne nos navires 
Gais lurons nos marins 
Toujours fidèles au poste,
Hardis, gars, hardis! 
L&#x27;avenir est à nous les vrais!

Coeur de chêne nos navires, 
Gais lurons nos marins, 
Toujours fidèles au poste,
Hardis, gars, hardis! 
L&#x27;avenir est à nous les vrais conquérants!
==Notes==
:1.Some cadet units use instead &quot;Fleurons ajoutons à cet an sans déboire&quot;.

==New lyrics==
A new version was presented on 16 April 1809 and published by Reverend Rylance.

When Alfred, our King, drove the Dane from this land,
He planted an oak with his own royal hand;
And he pray&#x27;d for Heaven&#x27;s blessing to hallow the tree,
As a sceptre for England, the queen of the sea.

Chorus:
:Heart of oak are our ships,
:Hearts of oak are our men,
:We always are ready, steady boys, steady,
:To charge and to conquer again and again.

The sapling shot up and stuck firm to the ground;
It defied every tempest that bellow&#x27;d around;
And still was it seen with fresh vigour to shoot,
When the blood of our martyrs had moisten&#x27;d its root.

(Chorus)

But the worms of corruption had eaten their way
Through its bark; till a Wardle has swept them away,
He has sworn, no such reptiles our tree shall infest,
And our patriots soon shall extirpate the nest.

(Chorus)

Yon tyrant, whose rule abject Europe bemoans —
Yon brood of usurpers who sit on her thrones —
Shall look on our country, and tremble with awe,
&quot;Where a son of the Monarch has bow&#x27;d to the law&quot;,

(Chorus)

Now long live the &quot;Briton&quot;, who dar&#x27;d to revive
The spirit which Britons scarce felt was alive;
His name shall be , while of freedom we sing,
On the oak that was planted by Alfred our King.

(Chorus)

<doc id="13867" wikidata="Q312722" url="?curid=13867" title="Harold Holt">
<text>Harold Edward Holt (5 August 190817 December 1967) was an Australian politician and lawyer who served as the 17th prime minister of Australia from 1966 until his disappearance and presumed death in 1967. He held office as leader of the Liberal Party of Australia and held various ministerial positions from 1949 to 1966 in the governments of Robert Menzies and Arthur Fadden.

Holt was born in Sydney and moved to Melbourne in childhood, studying law at the University of Melbourne. Before entering politics he practised law and was a lobbyist for cinema operators. He was first elected to the House of Representatives at the age of 27, becoming a member of parliament (MP) for the division of Fawkner at a by-election in 1935. A member of the United Australia Party (UAP), Holt was made a minister without portfolio in 1939, when his mentor Robert Menzies became prime minister. His tenure in the ministry was interrupted by a brief stint in the Australian Army, which ended when he was recalled to cabinet following the deaths of three ministers in the 1940 Canberra air disaster. The government was defeated in 1941, sending the UAP into opposition, and he joined the new Liberal Party upon its creation in 1945.

When the Liberals came to office in 1949, Holt became a senior figure in the new government. As Minister for Immigration (1949–1956), he expanded the post-war immigration scheme and relaxed the White Australia policy for the first time. He was also influential as Minister for Labour and National Service (1949–1958), where he handled several industrial relations disputes. Holt was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party in 1956, and after the 1958 election replaced Arthur Fadden as Treasurer. He oversaw the creation of the Reserve Bank of Australia and the decimal Australian dollar, but was blamed for a credit crunch that almost cost the Coalition the 1961 election. However, the economy soon rebounded and Holt retained his place as Menzies&#x27; heir apparent.

Holt became prime minister in January 1966, elected unopposed as Liberal leader following Menzies&#x27; retirement. He fought a general election later that year, winning a landslide victory. The Holt government continued the dismantling of the White Australia policy, amended the constitution to give the federal government responsibility for indigenous affairs, and took Australia out of the sterling area. Holt promoted greater engagement with Asia and the Pacific, and made visits to a number of East Asian countries. His government expanded Australia&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War, and maintained close ties with the United States under President Lyndon B. Johnson. While visiting the White House, Holt proclaimed that he was &quot;all the way with LBJ&quot;, a remark which was poorly received at home.

In December 1967, Holt disappeared while swimming in rough conditions at Cheviot Beach, Victoria. He was presumed dead, although his body was never recovered; his disappearance spawned a number of conspiracy theories. Holt was the third Australian prime minister to die in office. He was succeeded by Country Party leader John McEwen on an interim basis and then by John Gorton. His death was commemorated in a number of ways, among them by the establishment of the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre in Melbourne.

== Early life ==
===Birth and family background===
Holt was born on 5 August 1908 at his parents&#x27; home in Stanmore, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney. He was the first of two sons born to Olive May (née Williams; formerly Pearce) and Thomas James Holt; his younger brother Clifford was born in 1910. His parents had married seven months before his birth, in January 1908. On his father&#x27;s side, Holt was descended from James Holt, a cobbler from Birmingham, England, who arrived in New South Wales in 1829. His paternal grandfather, Thomas Holt Sr., owned a large farming property in Nubba, and was twice elected mayor of nearby Wallendbeen. Holt&#x27;s father trained as a schoolteacher in Sydney and when Harold was born, worked as a physical education teacher at the Cleveland Street School in Surry Hills. Holt&#x27;s mother was born in Eudunda, South Australia, and had Cornish, English, German, and Irish ancestry; her sister was the actress Vera Pearce.

===Education===

In 1914, Holt&#x27;s parents moved to Adelaide, where his father became the licensee of a hotel in Payneham. He and his brother stayed behind in Sydney, living with an uncle and attending Randwick Public School. In late 1916, Holt was sent to live with grandparents in the country, where he briefly attended the Nubba State School. He returned to Sydney the following year, and for three years was enrolled at Abbotsholme College, a private school in Killara; his parents separated around that time. In 1920, Holt began boarding at Wesley College, Melbourne. He was a popular and talented student, winning a scholarship in his final year and graduating second in his class. Holt generally spent school holidays with his relatives in Nubba or with schoolmates, rather than with his parents – his father had begun working as a talent agent, touring the country on the Tivoli circuit, while his mother died in 1925. He was 16 at the time, and was unable to attend the funeral.

In 1927, Holt began studying law at the University of Melbourne, living at Queen&#x27;s College on a scholarship. He represented the university in cricket and football, and was also active in various student organisations, serving as president of the Law Students&#x27; Society and of the Queen&#x27;s College social club. Holt won prizes for oratory and essay-writing, and was a member of the inter-university debating team. He graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1930. Holt&#x27;s father – living in London – invited him to continue his studies in England, but he declined the offer.

===Legal career===
Holt served his articles of clerkship with the firm of Fink, Best &amp; Miller. He was admitted to the Victorian Bar in late 1932, and opened his own legal practice the following year. However, clients during the Depression were scarce and frequently underpaid, so Holt lived in a boardinghouse and often relied upon the hospitality of friends. Drawing on his family connections in show business, he eventually accepted an offer to become secretary of the Victorian Cinematograph Exhibitors&#x27; Association, a film industry lobby group. In this capacity he appeared several times before the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. This had a positive effect on his own practice, and he eventually took on two partners, first Jack Graham and later James Newman. The firm of Holt, Graham, &amp; Newman was dissolved in 1963, following a financial dispute and subsequently reconstituted as Holt, Newman, &amp; Holt, with Holt&#x27;s son Sam as the new addition. Holt&#x27;s involvement in the practice declined once he entered politics and ceased altogether in 1949, although he did not formally retire until assuming the prime ministership.

==Early political career==

In 1933, Holt joined the Young Nationalists, the youth wing of the United Australia Party. He cultivated a friendship with Mabel Brookes, and through Brookes became acquainted with senior members of the influential Australian Women&#x27;s National League (AWNL). He also secured the patronage of Robert Menzies, with whom he shared a similar background and political views. At the 1934 federal election, Holt stood for the UAP in the Division of Yarra. It was a safe seat for the Labor Party, held by the party&#x27;s leader (and former prime minister) James Scullin. Holt lost heavily, as was expected, but was praised for his campaigning. Early the following year, he contested Clifton Hill – another safe Labor seat – at the Victorian state election, losing to Bert Cremean. Holt was eventually elected to parliament on his third attempt, winning a federal by-election for the seat of Fawkner in August 1935; his predecessor, George Maxwell, had died in office. He won UAP preselection against five other candidates, a victory which &quot;Smith&#x27;s Weekly&quot; attributed to his &quot;political godmothers&quot; in the AWNL. His new seat was centred on Melbourne&#x27;s wealthy inner-eastern suburbs.

Holt was twenty-seven years old when he entered parliament, making him its youngest member. He kept a relatively low profile in his first few years, but spoke on a wide range of topics. When Robert Menzies became prime minister in April 1939, he made Holt one of four ministers without portfolio. His inclusion was made possible by the collapse of the coalition with the Country Party – previously a certain number of positions had been reserved for Country MPs, but the new ministry was composed solely of UAP members. Although Holt officially had no portfolio, he effectively was an assistant minister to Richard Casey, who headed the Department of Supply &amp; Development. He was given responsibility for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and also acted for periods as Minister for Trade and Customs and Minister for Civil Aviation and Air while the incumbents were overseas. Holt&#x27;s first stint as a government minister came to an end in March 1940, when the coalition with the Country Party was reinstituted. His replacement was Arthur Fadden, another future prime minister.

==World War II==
Holt enlisted in the Militia in February 1939, joining a part-time artillery unit for businessmen and professionals. He was given indefinite leave during his ministerial service. In May 1940, without resigning his seat, Holt enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force with the intent of becoming a full-time soldier. Several of his parliamentary colleagues did likewise at various points in the war. Holt was posted to the 2/4th Field Regiment, holding the rank of gunner. He had been offered a commission as an officer in the Royal Australian Air Force, but declined due to his lack of experience. In a press statement, Holt said &quot;as the youngest member of the House, I could not feel happy in my position if I were not prepared to make some sacrifice and take an active part&quot;. He was sent to Puckapunyal for training, and expected to be posted to North Africa or Palestine.

Holt&#x27;s brief military career came to an end as a result of the Canberra air disaster on 13 August, which killed three senior government ministers. Menzies called an early general election for 21 September, which resulted in a hung parliament and a UAP–Country minority government. Holt was given leave from the army to campaign, and won re-election with a large majority. Menzies subsequently asked him to return to cabinet, to which he agreed. Holt was sworn in as Minister for Labour and National Service on 28 October, and formally resigned from the army the same day. He was placed in charge of the new Department of Labour and National Service, which took over most of the responsibilities of the previous Department of Industry. He also became a member of the bipartisan Advisory War Council, although he personally favoured the establishment of a national unity government with the Labor Party.

As labour minister, Holt&#x27;s foremost task was to prevent industrial disputes from disrupting the war effort. He met with union leaders and employer groups, and secured their agreement to a streamlining of the arbitration process while the war was underway. He had also been made Minister in charge of Scientific and Industrial Research, which gave him responsibility for the CSIR and its wartime efforts. In April 1941, Holt sponsored and oversaw the passage of the &quot;Child Endowment Act&quot;, which introduced a universal child endowment scheme; newspapers labelled him &quot;the godfather to a million Australian children&quot;. When leadership troubles hit the Coalition later in the year, Holt initially supported Menzies. However, he and five cabinet colleagues eventually transferred their allegiance to Arthur Fadden, the leader of the Country Party, believing this way the only to ensure stable government. Menzies felt he had been betrayed, but forgave Holt and accepted his assurances that he had been acting in the best interests of the country.

Holt retained his portfolios in the Fadden government, which lasted only 40 days before being defeated on a confidence motion in October 1941. After going into opposition, he kept a reasonably low profile for the remainder of the war, except for his membership of the Joint Committee on War Expenditure. He was criticised by some for not re-joining the army, and at the 1943 election was opposed by Brigadier William Cremor, whose campaign was funded by Sydney businessmen (including Keith Murdoch). He lost a significant portion of his primary vote, but suffered only a small swing on the two-party-preferred count. Menzies returned as leader of the UAP in September 1943, and Holt was initially a candidate for the deputy leadership; he withdrew once former prime minister Billy Hughes entered the race. Holt was in favour of the creation of the Liberal Party, but played little role in the practical aspects of its establishment. He became an official member of the new party in February 1945.

==Postwar ministerial career==

After eight years in opposition, the Coalition won the federal election of December 1949 and Menzies began his record-setting second period as Prime Minister. In a redistribution held ahead of that election, Holt&#x27;s majority in Fawkner nearly disappeared. He transferred to Higgins, one of several new seats created in the 1949 redistribution. The seat was created as a safe Liberal seat; it had been carved out of the wealthier portions of Fawkner. Holt won it easily. He was appointed to the prestigious portfolios of Minister for Labour and National Service (1949–1958; he had previously served in this portfolio 1940–41) and Minister for Immigration (1949–1956), by which time he was being touted in the press as a &quot;certain successor to Menzies and a potential Prime Minister&quot;. In Immigration, Holt continued and expanded the massive immigration programme initiated by his ALP predecessor, Arthur Calwell. However, he displayed a more flexible and caring attitude than Calwell, who was a strong advocate of the White Australia policy. One of his first acts was to intervene in the case of Lorenzo Gamboa, a Filipino man with an Australian wife and children who had been denied entry by Calwell due to his race. Holt reversed the decision, allowing Gamboa to settle in Australia permanently.

Holt excelled in the Labour portfolio and has been described as one of the best Labour ministers since Federation. Although the conditions were ripe for industrial unrest—Communist influence in the union movement was then at its peak, and the right-wing faction in Cabinet was openly agitating for a showdown with the unions—the combination of strong economic growth and Holt&#x27;s enlightened approach to industrial relations saw the number of working hours lost to strikes fall dramatically, from over two million in 1949 to just 439,000 in 1958. He also had ministerial responsibility for the Melbourne Olympics in 1956.

Holt fostered greater collaboration between the government, the courts, employers and trade unions. He enjoyed good relationships with union leaders like Albert Monk, President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions; and Jim Healy, leader of the radical Waterside Workers Federation;and he gained a reputation for tolerance, restraint and a willingness to compromise, although his controversial decision to use troops to take control of cargo facilities during a waterside dispute in Bowen, Queensland in September 1953 provoked bitter criticism.

Holt&#x27;s personal profile and political standing grew throughout the 1950s. He served on numerous committees and overseas delegations, he was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1953, and in 1954 he was named one of Australia&#x27;s six best-dressed men. In 1956, he was elected Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and became Leader of the House, and from this point on, he was generally acknowledged as Menzies&#x27; heir apparent.

===Treasurer (1958–1966)===

In December 1958, following the retirement of Arthur Fadden, Holt succeeded him as Treasurer. Holt had little knowledge or interest in economics, but the job cemented his position as Menzies&#x27; likely successor. As Treasurer, Holt relied strongly on the advice of Treasury secretary Roland Wilson. His achievements included major reforms to the banking system (originated by Fadden)including the establishment of the Reserve Bank of Australiaand the planning and preparation for the introduction of decimal currency. It was Holt who convinced Cabinet to call the new currency the &quot;dollar&quot; rather than the &quot;royal&quot;.

The economy Holt inherited was growing strongly, aided by the opening of new iron ore mines. However, in 1959, inflation was running at 4.5% and Treasury was alarmed. Holt was reluctant to act, but in November 1960 introduced a deflationary package of tax changes. He also reluctantly agreed to an interest rate rise by the Reserve Bank. The credit squeeze was nicknamed the &quot;Holt jolt&quot;. The economy went into recession, and unemployment rose to three percent, which was considered high for the time and contrary to the government&#x27;s policy of full employment.

The credit squeeze brought the Coalition dangerously close to losing the 1961 election, with the Coalition being returned with a precarious one-seat majority. There were calls for Holt to be sacked, but he retained Menzies&#x27; support. He later described 1960–61 as &quot;my most difficult year in public life&quot;. Most of the deflationary measures were reversed in 1962, and unemployment dropped down to 1.5 percent by August 1963. In later budgets, Holt retreated to his Queensland holiday home while it was being prepared. He said that the 1965 budget &quot;has had the best reception yet of any in the series I have presented&quot;.

==Prime Minister (1966–1967)==
Holt was sworn in as prime minister on 26 January 1966, following the retirement of Robert Menzies six days earlier. He won the leadership election unopposed, with William McMahon elected as his deputy. His swearing in was delayed by the death of Defence Minister Shane Paltridge; he and Menzies were both pallbearers at Paltridge&#x27;s state funeral on 25 January. Holt was the first Australian prime minister born in the 20th century and the first born after federation. He was almost fourteen years younger than his predecessor, but, at the age of 57, was still the fourth-oldest man to assume the office.

He had been an MP for over 30 years before becoming prime minister, still the longest wait for any non-caretaker Prime Minister. The only person who had a longer wait was his caretaker successor John McEwen, who had served 33 years before ascending to the post. Stylistically, Holt was more informal and contemporary than Menzies, and his wife accompanied him into the political spotlight. He gave the media an unprecedented level of access, and was the first prime minister to conduct regular press conferences and grant regular television interviews. His press secretary, Tony Eggleton, accompanied him virtually every time he travelled.

Holt&#x27;s initial cabinet was virtually unchanged from that of his predecessor. John Gorton and Les Bury were promoted to replace Menzies and Paltridge, but there were no other changes in composition. There were also no major changes in portfolio, outside of McMahon&#x27;s promotion to Treasurer in place of Holt. A notable addition to the outer ministry was Senator Annabelle Rankin as Minister for Housing – the first woman to hold a ministerial portfolio. A minor reshuffle occurred after the 1966 election, with Doug Anthony and Ian Sinclair added to cabinet and Charles Barnes demoted to the outer ministry. The only new government department created during Holt&#x27;s tenure was the Department of Education and Science, established in December 1966, which was the first federal department specific to either of those areas. The Country Party leader and de facto Deputy Prime Minister, John McEwen, was effectively given veto power over government policy by virtue of being the longest-tenured member of the government.

===Elections===
On 26 November 1966, Holt fought his first and only general election as prime minister, winning a somewhat unexpected landslide victory. The Coalition secured 56.9 percent of the two-party-preferred vote, gaining 10 seats and bringing its total number of seats in the House of Representatives to 82 out of 124, the largest majority government in Australian history at the time. The Liberals finished only two seats away from forming majority government in its own right. It was a higher margin of victory than Menzies had achieved in eight elections as Liberal leader, and was the Labor Party&#x27;s worst electoral defeat in 31 years.

Holt received little credit for the Coalition&#x27;s election victory, even from within his own party. It was generally held that the Labor Party&#x27;s poor campaign had been the major factor in its defeat. Arthur Calwell, the Leader of the Opposition, was 70 years old and had limited personal popularity – a Gallup poll before the election placed his personal approval rating at 24 percent, compared with Holt&#x27;s 60 percent. Calwell had suffered a damaging rift with his deputy Gough Whitlam earlier in the year, and the general public still perceived the party as divided. In an election where the Vietnam War was a major campaign issue, he and Whitlam publicly contradicted each other on major policy decisions. Labor ran on an anti-war platform, but struggled to appeal to voters concerned about national security; combined with Calwell&#x27;s dedication to the White Australia policy, this allowed the party to be portrayed as isolationist and naive about external affairs. Calwell was far less telegenic than his opponent, and was seen as gruff and antagonistic where Holt was suave and easy-going. At a rally in Adelaide a week before the election, Calwell accused Holt of having &quot;chickened out of World War II – just as his three stepsons are chickening out of the war in Vietnam today&quot;. His attack on Holt&#x27;s family – which he refused to withdraw – was viewed as desperate and undignified, and it was pointed out that, unlike Holt, Calwell had performed no military service in World War II.

In early 1967, Calwell retired as ALP leader. Whitlam succeeded him, and proved a far more effective opponent than Calwell had been, consistently getting the better of Holt both in the media and in parliament. Labor soon began to recover from its losses and gain ground. By this time, the long-suppressed tensions between the Coalition partners over economic and trade policies were also beginning to emerge. Throughout his reign as Liberal leader, Menzies had enforced strict party discipline but, once he was gone, dissension began to surface. Some Liberals soon became dissatisfied by what they saw as Holt&#x27;s weak leadership. Alan Reid asserts that Holt was being increasingly criticised within the party in the months before his death, that he was perceived as being &quot;vague, imprecise and evasive&quot; and &quot;nice to the point that his essential decency was viewed as weakness&quot;.

===Domestic policy===
According to his biographer Tom Frame, &quot;Holt&#x27;s inclinations and sympathies were those of the political centre [...] he was a pragmatist rather than a philosopher, but he nonetheless claimed a philosophical lineage connecting him with Alfred Deakin and approvingly quoted his statement that &#x27;we are liberal always, radical often, and reactionary never&#x27;.&quot;

====Economy====

Holt as prime minister was sometimes criticised for a failure to be assertive on economic matters. A major drought in 1965 had led to slowdown in growth, but he was unwilling to increase public spending in case it increased inflation. The Australian dollar – a legacy of Holt&#x27;s period as Treasurer – came into circulation on 14 February 1966, less than a month after his prime ministership began. In November 1967, the British government unexpectedly announced that it would be devaluing the pound sterling by 14 percent. Holt announced that the Australian government would not follow suit, effectively withdrawing Australia from the sterling area. The decision was strongly opposed by the Country Party, who feared it would disadvantage primary industry. McEwen went as far as to issue a public statement criticising the decision, which Holt considered a breach of cabinet solidarity. The dispute caused a breakdown in Holt and McEwen&#x27;s relationship and nearly brought down the Coalition; at one point, Holt made preparations for the Liberals to govern as a minority government the event McEwen tore up the Coalition agreement. Ultimately, the dispute was resolved in Holt&#x27;s favour. &quot;The Bulletin&quot; said that the withdrawal was &quot;quite certain to mean the end of any remaining special relationship between Australia and Britain&quot;. There were no other important economic policy reforms made by the Holt government, although Australia did become a founding member of the Asian Development Bank in 1966.

====Immigration====
As prime minister, Holt continued the liberalisation of immigration law that he had begun as Minister for Immigration. When he came to office, what remained of the White Australia policy was upheld by ministerial decree rather than by explicit legislation. In March 1966, the residency requirement for naturalisation was changed to a uniform five years; it had previously been 15 years for non-whites. Discriminatory provisions relating to family reunification were also removed. As a result, in the two years after March 1966 around 3,000 Asian immigrants were granted Australian citizenship, compared with 4,100 in the preceding two decades. Additionally, Immigration Minister Hubert Opperman announced that potential immigrants to Australia would be assessed solely &quot;on the basis of their suitability as settlers, their ability to integrate readily, and their possession of qualifications which are in fact positively useful to Australia&quot;; non-whites had previously had to demonstrate that they were &quot;highly qualified and distinguished&quot; to gain entry.

Keith Wilson believed that the Holt government&#x27;s reforms ensured that &quot;from now on there will not be in any of our laws or in any of our regulations anything that discriminates against migrants on the grounds of colour or race&quot;. However, there would not be a practical change in the composition of Australia&#x27;s immigration intake for many more years. Holt maintained that &quot;every country reserves to itself the right to decide what the composition of its people shall be&quot;, and promised &quot;a community life free from serious minority and racial problems&quot;. He was careful to frame his changes as simply a modification of existing policy, in order to avoid alienating organised labour (historically the greatest supporters of restricting non-white immigration). The Labor Party had only removed &quot;White Australia&quot; from its platform in 1965, and Opposition Leader Arthur Calwell stated he was &quot;determined to continue to oppose, for many obvious reasons, any attempt to create a multi-racial society in our midst&quot;. However, Holt was less circumspect outside Australia, telling British journalists that no White Australia policy existed and ordering Australian embassies to promote the changes to Asian governments and media outlets.

====Constitutional reform====
In 1967, the Holt government amended the constitution to alter section 51 (xxvi) and remove section 127. This gave the federal government the power to legislate specifically for Indigenous Australians, and also mandated counting Indigenous people in the census. The constitutional amendments required a referendum before they could be enacted, which passed with over 90 percent of the vote; it remains the largest referendum majority in Australian history. Holt personally considered the amendments unnecessary and mostly symbolic, but thought they would be well received by the international community (particularly Asia). According to Barrie Dexter, he was privately shocked by the referendum result, having been uncertain whether it would even pass.

Holt came to regard the referendum as indicative of a shift in the national mood. In the following months, he toured Aboriginal communities and consulted with indigenous leaders, including Charles Perkins and Kath Walker. Despite opposition from state governments, he created a new Office of Aboriginal Affairs within the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department, as well as a new advisory body called the Council of Aboriginal Affairs (chaired by H. C. Coombs). According to Coombs and Paul Hasluck, Holt had little interest in indigenous affairs before becoming prime minister. Despite this, he brought about a fundamental shift in the way policy was handled, paving the way for the federal government to assume many of the powers and responsibilities that had previously been the preserve of the states. Indigenous academic Gary Foley has said that Holt&#x27;s death was a setback for Aboriginal people, as his successors did not show the same commitment to the framework that he established.

The Holt government also unsuccessfully attempted to remove section 24 of the constitution (the so-called &quot;nexus clause&quot;), which requires the number of members in the House of Representatives to be &quot;as nearly as practicable, twice the number of senators&quot;. The resulting referendum did not come close to passing, with only 40 percent voting in favour nationwide and only one state (New South Wales) recording a majority. All three major-party leaders campaigned for the &quot;Yes&quot; vote, while opposition came mainly from Coalition backbenchers and Democratic Labor Party senators. Supporters of the &quot;No&quot; vote successfully argued that section 24 protected the influence of the Senate, and thus the interests of less populous states and rural areas. Holt did make one other significant legal reform, albeit one that did not require a constitutional amendment. In September 1967, he announced that his government would use section 74 of the constitution to remove the potential for High Court cases to be appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The necessary legislation was not passed until after his death.

====The arts====
In November 1967, in one of his last major policy statements, Holt announced the establishment of the National Gallery of Australia and the Australia Council for the Arts. The National Gallery, which did not open until 1982, was the first arts-related major infrastructure project to be funded by the federal government; previous projects had been funded by state governments or by private subscription. Holt said it would &quot;add significantly to the cultural life of Australia and the national capital&quot;. The other element of his announcement, the Australia Council for the Arts, was the first national arts council, intended to provide arms-length advice to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department on arts funding. Rupert Myer has suggested that &quot;Holt&#x27;s legacy ought to be a core belief in, and broad public demand for, the sustained support of cultural activity from all three tiers of government&quot;.

===Foreign policy===

Holt believed it was his responsibility as prime minister &quot;to reflect the modern Australia to my fellow countrymen, to our allies and the outside world at large&quot;. His approach to national security emphasised opposition to international communism and the need to engage more with Asia. Holt said that the &quot;great central fact of modern history&quot; was &quot;the tremendous power conflict between the communist world and the free world&quot;. He was a strong believer in the domino theory and containment, holding that communism had to be fought wherever it occurred in order to prevent it spreading to neighbouring countries. In April 1967, Holt told parliament that &quot;geographically we are part of Asia, and increasingly we have become aware of our involvement in the affairs of Asia – our greatest dangers and our highest hopes are centred in Asia&#x27;s tomorrows&quot;. Gough Whitlam said that Holt &quot;made Australia better known in Asia and he made Australians more aware of Asia than ever before [...] this I believe was his most important contribution to our future&quot;.

Personal diplomacy was Holt&#x27;s strong point – he believed diplomatic ties could be strengthened by making intimate connections with other world leaders. This approach was disliked by his external affairs minister, Paul Hasluck, who in his memoirs accused him of believing in &quot;instant diplomacy&quot; and crediting his personal charms for advances made by diplomatic officials. As prime minister, Holt&#x27;s first overseas trip was to South-East Asia in April 1966, where he visited Malaysia, Singapore, South Vietnam, and Thailand. He toured Cambodia, Laos, South Korea, and Taiwan in March and April 1967, and had planned to visit Burma, India, Indonesia, Japan, and Pakistan in 1968. Most of those countries had never before been visited by an Australian prime minister. There were also a number of reciprocal visits from East Asian leaders, including Eisaku Satō of Japan, Souvanna Phouma of Laos, and Thanom Kittikachorn of Thailand. The most controversial of those occurred in January 1967, when Prime Minister Nguyễn Cao Kỳ of South Vietnam visited on Holt&#x27;s personal invitation – issued without consulting cabinet. Public sentiment was beginning to turn against the war, and Ky&#x27;s visit was met with large demonstrations; opposition leader Arthur Calwell issued a statement calling him a &quot;miserable little butcher&quot;. Ky nonetheless handled himself well, and &quot;The Bulletin&quot; called his visit a &quot;personal triumph&quot;.

====Vietnam War====
The Vietnam War was the dominant foreign policy issue during Holt&#x27;s term in office. He was a strong supporter of Australian involvement in the war, which had begun in 1962, and accused its critics of adopting a &quot;Lotus Land&quot; attitude. As well as citing Australia&#x27;s SEATO obligations to South Vietnam, Holt justified the war on the grounds that Australia was morally obligated to &quot;resist communist subversion and aggression&quot; and &quot;defend the right of every people to choose their own social and economic order&quot;. He held that &quot;unless there is security for all small nations, there cannot be security for any small nation&quot;.

In March 1966, Holt announced that the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, would be withdrawn and replaced by the 1st Australian Task Force, a self-contained brigade-sized unit based at Nui Dat. This effectively tripled the number of Australian troops in Vietnam to around 4,500, and also included 1,500 national servicemen – the first conscripts to serve in the conflict. By the final months of Holt&#x27;s prime ministership, Australia had over 8,000 personnel stationed in South Vietnam, drawn from all three branches of the Australian Defence Force; the final troop increase was announced in October 1967. Holt &quot;never deviated from his whole-hearted support for American bombing of North Vietnam and the hope that steadily increasing the number of foreign troops deployed to South Vietnam would lead to military victory and a solution to the crisis&quot;. John Gorton later said it was &quot;ironical that, being a man of peace, he should have presided over one of the greatest build-ups of military power that Australia has found itself engaged in&quot;.

The government&#x27;s handling of the war initially enjoyed broad public support, and was considered a key contributor to the landslide election victory in 1966 – referred to by some as a &quot;khaki election&quot;. By the end of the following year, however, opinion polls were showing that public sentiment had turned against the war, and previously supportive media outlets had begun to criticised Holt&#x27;s decision-making. He did not live long enough to see the mass demonstrations experienced by his successors. Political opposition to the war was initially led by Opposition Leader Arthur Calwell, who promised a total withdrawal from the conflict and labelled it a &quot;cruel, unwinnable civil war&quot;. His replacement, Gough Whitlam, adopted a more pragmatic approach, focusing on policy specifics (particularly the government&#x27;s apparent lack of an exit strategy) rather than the validity of the war itself.

====&quot;All the way with LBJ&quot;====
Holt cultivated a close relationship with the United States under President Lyndon B. Johnson. He believed that &quot;without the American shield most of us who live in Asia and the South Pacific would have a continuing sense of insecurity&quot;. Cooperation between the two countries extended beyond the Vietnam War. Holt approved the construction of several Earth stations for use by NASA and American intelligence agencies, including Pine Gap, Honeysuckle Creek, and Tidbinbilla. This made Australia &quot;the most substantial centre for American missile and space operations outside the continental United States&quot;.

Holt and Johnson developed a personal friendship. They were the same age, and had first met in 1942, when Johnson visited Melbourne as a naval officer; afterwards they shared a similar career trajectory. Holt visited the U.S. twice while in office, in June and July 1966, and on the latter visit was invited to stay at Camp David. He and Johnson reportedly played tennis, lounged by the pool, and watched movies together. In October 1966, Johnson made the first visit to Australia by an incumbent American president; Vice President Hubert Humphrey had visited in February of that year. He toured five cities, and was greeted by large crowds as well as a number of anti-war demonstrators, who disrupted the presidential motorcade. The opposition criticised the visit as a publicity stunt. Johnson later returned to Australia for Holt&#x27;s memorial service, and invited his widow Zara to stay with him when she visited the United States in 1969.

On his first visit to the U.S., Holt made what was widely viewed as a &quot;faux pas&quot; while delivering a ceremonial address at the White House. Departing from his prepared remarks, he said: &quot;And so, sir, in the lonelier and perhaps even more disheartening moments which come to any national leader, I hope there will be a corner of your mind and heart which takes cheer from the fact that you have an admiring friend, a staunch friend that will be &quot;all the way with LBJ&quot;.&quot; Holt had meant it to be a &quot;light-hearted gesture of goodwill towards a generous host&quot;, referencing the slogan used in Johnson&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign. It was interpreted as such by his immediate audience, but once it was reported back in Australia it came to be viewed as a &quot;foolish, sycophantic and dangerous statement&quot; that was indicative of Australian subservience. Bill Hayden said Holt&#x27;s remarks &quot;shocked and insulted many Australians [...] its seeming servility was an embarrassment and a worry&quot;. Newspaper editorials generally agreed with Holt&#x27;s assertion that he had been misinterpreted, but still criticised him for making an error in judgment. His comments intensified anti-war sentiments among those who were already opposed to the war, but had little electoral impact. Nonetheless, &quot;all the way with LBJ&quot; is still remembered as Holt&#x27;s &quot;best-known utterance&quot;.

====Britain and the Commonwealth====

Holt was a strong supporter of the Commonwealth of Nations, and believed its member states had moral obligations to one another – particularly Britain, as the former &quot;mother country&quot;. However, his relationship with Harold Wilson, the British prime minister, was somewhat frosty. He repeatedly lobbied Wilson to maintain a strong British presence &quot;East of Suez&quot;, in order to complement American efforts, and in early 1967 received assurances that no reduction was being contemplated. However, by the middle of the year Wilson had announced that Britain intended to close all of its bases in Asia by the early 1970s (except for Hong Kong). In response to Holt&#x27;s concerns, it was suggested by Wilson that a British naval base could be established in Cockburn Sound. Holt rejected this outright, and felt that Wilson had deliberately misled him as to his intentions.

===Controversies===
Holt&#x27;s popularity and political standing was damaged by his perceived poor handling of a series of controversies that emerged during 1967. In April, the ABC&#x27;s new nightly current affairs program &quot;This Day Tonight&quot; ran a story which criticised the government&#x27;s decision not to reappoint the Chair of the ABC Board, Sir James Darling. Holt responded rashly, questioning the impartiality of the ABC and implying political bias on the part of journalist Mike Willesee (whose father Don Willesee was an ALP Senator and future Whitlam government minister), and his statement drew strong protests from both Willesee and the Australian Journalists&#x27; Association.

In May, increasing pressure from the media and within the Liberal Party forced Holt to announce a parliamentary debate on the question of a second inquiry into the 1964 sinking of to be held on 16 May. The debate included the maiden speech by newly elected NSW Liberal MP Edward St John QC, who used the opportunity to criticise the government&#x27;s attitude to new evidence about the disaster. An enraged Holt interrupted St John&#x27;s speech, in defiance of the parliamentary convention that maiden speeches are heard in silence; his blunder embarrassed the government and further undermined Holt&#x27;s support in the Liberal Party. A few days later, Holt announced a new Royal Commission into the disaster.

In October the government became embroiled in another embarrassing controversy over the alleged misuse of VIP aircraft, which came to a head when John Gorton (Government Leader in the Senate) tabled documents that showed that Holt had unintentionally misled Parliament in his earlier answers on the matter. Support for his leadership was eroded even further by his refusal to sack the Minister for Air, Peter Howson, in order to defuse the scandal, fuelling criticism from within the party that Holt was &quot;weak&quot; and lacked Menzies&#x27; ruthlessness. Much of the blame for the episode within the Public Service was visited upon Sir John Bunting, Secretary of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department, although other figures such as the Deputy Secretary Peter Lawler were able to protect themselves. One of John Gorton&#x27;s first acts upon becoming Prime Minister in January 1968 was to sideline Bunting by creating a separate Department of the Cabinet Office with Bunting as its head, and replaced him with Lenox Hewitt.

In November 1967, the government suffered a serious setback in the senate election, winning just 42.8 per cent of the vote against Labor&#x27;s 45 per cent. The coalition also lost the seats of Corio and Dawson to Labor in by-elections. Alan Reid says that, within the party, the reversal was blamed on Holt&#x27;s mishandling of the V.I.P. planes scandal. Disquiet was growing about his leadership style and possible health problems.

==Disappearance==
Holt loved the ocean, particularly spearfishing, and had holiday homes at Portsea, Victoria, and Bingil Bay, Queensland. On 17 December 1967, while Holt was spending the weekend at Portsea, he and four companions decided to drive to Point Nepean to watch sailor Alec Rose pass through The Rip on his solo circumnavigation attempt. On their way back to Portsea, Holt convinced the group to stop at remote Cheviot Beach for a swim before lunch – he had spearfished there on many previous occasions, and claimed to &quot;know this beach like the back of my hand&quot;. Because of the rough conditions, only one other person, Alan Stewart, joined Holt in the water. Stewart kept close to shore, but Holt swam out into deeper water and was seemingly caught up in a rip, eventually disappearing from view. One of the witnesses, Marjorie Gillespie, described it as &quot;like a leaf being taken out [...] so quick and final&quot;.

Holt&#x27;s disappearance sparked &quot;one of the largest search operations in Australian history&quot;, but no trace of his body was ever found. At 10 p.m. on 18 December, Governor-General Lord Casey announced he had terminated Holt&#x27;s commission as prime minister upon his presumed death. A police report released in early 1968 made no definitive findings about Holt&#x27;s death, while a coronial inquest in 2005 returned a verdict of accidental drowning. It is generally accepted that Holt overestimated his swimming ability. Some have alleged that Holt committed suicide, but those close to him rejected this as uncharacteristic of his personality. Conspiracy theories have included suggestions that Holt faked his own death, was assassinated by the CIA, or was collected by a submarine so that he could defect to China.

A memorial service for Holt was held at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne, on 22 December, and attended by numerous world leaders. Aged 59 at the time of his death, Holt became the third Australian prime minister to die in office, after Joseph Lyons (1939) and John Curtin (1945). John McEwen, the leader of the Country Party, was sworn in as caretaker prime minister on 19 December. The Liberal Party held a leadership election on 9 January 1968, in which John Gorton defeated Paul Hasluck, Billy Snedden, and Les Bury. Gorton was a member of the Senate, and in line with constitutional convention sought and gained election to the House of Representatives at the by-election caused by Holt&#x27;s death.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===

While at university, Holt met Zara Dickins, the daughter of a Melbourne businessman; there was an &quot;instant mutual attraction&quot;. They made plans to marry once Holt had graduated, but after a financial dispute chose to separate. Zara went on a trip to Britain, where she was introduced to James Fell, a British Indian Army officer. She accompanied Fell to India, and then in early 1935 returned to Australia where Holt again proposed marriage. She declined his offer, and married Fell a short time later, going to live with him in Jabalpur. Holt had entered parliament by that time, and was soon being profiled as &quot;the most eligible bachelor in parliament&quot;. He briefly dated Lola Thring, the daughter of his father&#x27;s business partner, F. W. Thring, but his widowed father Tom was also interested in her (to his son&#x27;s &quot;disgust&quot;). Tom Holt married Lola in 1936, and their daughter Frances (Harold&#x27;s half-sister) was born in 1940; Tom Holt died in 1945.

In 1937, Zara returned to Australia to give birth to her first child, Nicholas. She had two more children, twins Sam and Andrew, in 1939. Her marriage with Fell broke down a short time later, and in late 1940 she returned to Australia permanently and resumed a relationship with Holt. Their relationship did not become public for some time, in order to avoid Holt&#x27;s being implicated in Zara&#x27;s divorce proceedings. They eventually married on 8 October 1946, at Zara&#x27;s parents&#x27; home on St Georges Road, Toorak. They initially lived on nearby Washington Street, but in 1954 bought the St Georges Road house. Holt legally adopted Zara&#x27;s three children, and as young men they changed their surname to his. According to biographer Tom Frame, it was an &quot;open secret&quot; that Holt was the biological father of the twins, as they shared his physical appearance and had been conceived at a time when Zara was known to have been in Melbourne.

Zara Holt was a successful businesswoman, owning a chain of dress shops, and out-earned her husband even as prime minister. It was her success that allowed the couple to purchase two holiday homes, one at Portsea, Victoria, and the other at Bingil Bay, Queensland. She nonetheless made sacrifices for her husband&#x27;s political career, accompanying him on all but one of his overseas trips, which could last for weeks.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Zara remarried in 1969 to one of his Liberal Party colleagues, Jeff Bate. She was widowed a second time in 1984, and died in 1989. In a 1988 interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Zara stated that her husband Harold had carried on &quot;dozens&quot; of extramarital affairs. In his biography of Holt, Tom Frame wrote: &quot;I have not included the names of women with whom Holt allegedly had a sexual relationship because I was unable to confirm or deny that most of these relationships took place […] by their very nature they were always illicit and Holt was very discreet.&quot;

===Personality===
Holt was the first Australian Prime Minister born in the twentieth century. He was an enthusiastic sportsman and avid swimmer, in stark contrast to Menzies and the majority of his predecessors and colleagues. Like later successor Bob Hawke, this resonated with positive effect within the electorate. His oratory skills were vastly superior to that of Arthur Calwell, whom Holt resoundingly beat in 1966. Holt&#x27;s rhetoric was, however, considered a match to that of new Labor leader Gough Whitlam. Whitlam himself later said of Holt:

===Religious beliefs===
Holt has been described as an &quot;apathetic agnostic&quot;. He was baptised Anglican, attended Methodist schools, and married with Presbyterian forms, but neither he nor his wife had any interest in religion. His lack of religiosity apparently had little impact on his political prospects, and was not generally remarked upon. Alick Downer believed that Holt&#x27;s thoughts &quot;lay in this world not the next&quot;. According to his friend Simon Warrender, he &quot;was an agnostic whose &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; was dedication to his career&quot;. Holt had a reputation as something of a fatalist, and frequently quoted from Andrew Marvell&#x27;s &quot;carpe diem&quot; poem &quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot;. He was also fond of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;If—&quot;, which Warrender said he used as a &quot;guiding light in his political and private life&quot;.

==Memorials and other legacies==


Harold Holt is commemorated by the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre in the Melbourne suburb of Glen Iris. The complex was under construction at the time of Holt&#x27;s disappearance, and since he was the local member, it was named in his memory. The irony of commemorating a man who is presumed to have drowned with a swimming pool has been a source of wry amusement for many Australians. The swimming pool within the 1st Australian Support Compound in South Vietnam was also named for him.

In 1968, the newly commissioned United States Navy &quot;Knox&quot;-class destroyer escort was named in his honour. It was launched by Holt&#x27;s widow Dame Zara at the Todd Shipyards in Los Angeles on 3 May 1969, and was the first American warship to bear the name of a foreign leader.

In 1969, a plaque commemorating Holt was bolted to the seafloor off Cheviot Beach after a memorial ceremony. It bears the inscription:

Other memorials include:

* the suburb of Holt, Australian Capital Territory;
*the Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt;
* the Division of Holt, an electoral district in the Australian House of Representatives in Victoria;
* a wing for boarders at Wesley College, Melbourne;
* the Harold Holt Fisheries Reserves – five protected areas in southern Port Phillip, located at Swan Bay, Point Lonsdale, Mud Islands, Point Nepean and Pope&#x27;s Eye (The Annulus). 
* a memorial stone within the &#x27;Prime Ministers Garden&#x27; of Melbourne General Cemetery

By way of a folk memorial, he is recalled in the Australian vernacular expression &quot;do a Harold Holt&quot; (or &quot;do the Harry&quot;), rhyming slang for &quot;do a bolt&quot; meaning &quot;to disappear suddenly and without explanation&quot;, although this is usually employed in the context of disappearance from a social gathering rather than a case of presumed death.

In the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of June 1968, Holt&#x27;s widow Zara was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, becoming Dame Zara Holt DBE. She later married for a third time, to a Liberal party colleague of Holt&#x27;s, Jeff Bate, and was then known as Dame Zara Bate.

The mineral holtite is named in his honor. It was discovered in Greenbushes Tinfield, Western Australia and formally described in 1971.

<text>Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and United States. With roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock and acid rock, heavy metal bands developed a thick, monumental sound characterized by distorted guitars, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats and loudness.

In 1968, three of the genre&#x27;s most famous pioneers – British bands Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple – were founded. Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and shock rock of Alice Cooper and Kiss; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith; and the flashy guitar leads and party rock of Van Halen. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre&#x27;s evolution by discarding much of its blues influence, while Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as &quot;metalheads&quot; or &quot;headbangers&quot;. The lyrics of some metal genres became associated with aggression and machismo, an issue that has at times led to accusations of misogyny.

During the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe and Poison. Meanwhile, however, underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres such as death metal and black metal became – and remain – subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles have expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal and nu metal, the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip-hop.

==Characteristics==
Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound and vigorous vocals. Heavy metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter or omit one or more of these attributes. In a 1988 article, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Jon Pareles wrote, &quot;In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock—the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.&quot; The typical band lineup includes a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, a lead guitarist and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist. Keyboard instruments are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound. Deep Purple&#x27;s Jon Lord played an overdriven Hammond organ. In 1970, John Paul Jones used a Moog synthesizer on &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;; by the 1990s, synthesizers were used in &quot;almost every subgenre of heavy metal&quot;.
The electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal. The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy fuzz. For classic heavy metal guitar tone, guitarists maintain gain at moderate levels, without excessive preamp or pedal distortion, to retain open spaces and air in the music; the guitar amplifier is turned up loud to produce the &quot;punch and grind&quot; characteristic. Thrash metal guitar tone has scooped mid-frequencies and tightly compressed sound with multiple bass frequencies. Guitar solos are &quot;an essential element of the heavy metal code ... that underscores the significance of the guitar&quot; to the genre. Most heavy metal songs &quot;feature at least one guitar solo&quot;, which is &quot;a primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity&quot;. Some exceptions are nu metal and grindcore bands, which tend to omit guitar solos. With rhythm guitar parts, the &quot;heavy crunch sound in heavy metal ... [is created by] palm muting&quot; the strings with the picking hand and using distortion. Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end.

The lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional &quot;frontman&quot; or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two &quot;contend for dominance&quot; in a spirit of &quot;affectionate rivalry&quot;. Heavy metal &quot;demands the subordination of the voice&quot; to the overall sound of the band. Reflecting metal&#x27;s roots in the 1960s counterculture, an &quot;explicit display of emotion&quot; is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity. Critic Simon Frith claims that the metal singer&#x27;s &quot;tone of voice&quot; is more important than the lyrics.

The prominent role of the bass ‍is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element. The bass provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music &quot;heavy&quot;. The bass plays a &quot;more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock&quot;. Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica&#x27;s Cliff Burton with his heavy emphasis on bass ‍solos and use of chords while playing the ‍bass in the early 1980s. Lemmy of Motörhead often played overdriven power chords in his bass lines.

Heavy metal drumming is defined by a loud, consistent beat that drives the band, relying on the &quot;trifecta of speed, power, and precision.&quot; Heavy metal drumming &quot;requires an exceptional amount of endurance&quot;, and drummers have to develop &quot;considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity ... to play the intricate patterns&quot; used in heavy metal. A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music. Black metal, death metal and some &quot;mainstream metal&quot; bands &quot;all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats&quot;.
In live performance, loudness – an &quot;onslaught of sound&quot;, in sociologist Deena Weinstein&#x27;s description – is considered vital. In his book, &quot;Metalheads&quot;, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as &quot;the sensory equivalent of war&quot;. Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and the Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer&#x27;s Dick Peterson put it, &quot;All we knew was we wanted more power.&quot; A 1977 review of a Motörhead concert noted how &quot;excessive volume in particular figured into the band&#x27;s impact&quot;. Weinstein makes the case that in the same way that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to &quot;sweep the listener into the sound&quot; and to provide a &quot;shot of youthful vitality&quot;.

Heavy metal performers tended to be almost exclusively male until at least the mid-1980s, with some exceptions such as Girlschool. However, by the 2010s, women were making more of an impact, and PopMatters&#x27; Craig Hayes argues that metal &quot;clearly empowers women&quot;. In the power metal and symphonic metal subgenres, there has been a sizable number of bands that have had women as the lead singers, such as Nightwish, Delain and Within Temptation.

===Musical language===

====Rhythm and tempo====

The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the &quot;rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency&quot;. In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two- or three-note rhythmic figures – generally made up of eighth or 16th notes. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.

Brief, abrupt and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs, which help to establish thematic hooks. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be &quot;slow, even ponderous&quot;. By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos, and as recently as the 2000s, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 beats per minute) to extremely fast blast beat tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).

====Harmony====
One of the signatures of the genre is the guitar power chord. In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main interval, generally the perfect fifth, though an octave may be added as a doubling of the root. When power chords are played on the lower strings at high volumes and with distortion, additional low-frequency sounds are created, which add to the &quot;weight of the sound&quot; and create an effect of &quot;overwhelming power&quot;. Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord, power chords are also based on different intervals such as the minor third, major third, perfect fourth, diminished fifth or minor sixth. Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the fretboard.

====Typical harmonic structures====
Heavy metal is usually based on riffs created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of pedal points. Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes. Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-♭VI-♭VII, I-♭VII-(♭VI), or I-♭VI-IV-♭VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II (I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example). Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions. In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses &quot;pentatonic and blues-derived features&quot;.

The tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones – such as C to F# – was considered extremely dissonant and unstable by medieval and Renaissance music theorists. It was nicknamed the &quot;diabolus in musica –&quot; &quot;the devil in music&quot;.

Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of pedal point as a harmonic basis. A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts. According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are &quot;often quite complex&quot; and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is &quot;often very sophisticated&quot;. In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that &quot;heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated&quot; than other music researchers had realized.

====Relationship with classical music====

Robert Walser stated that, alongside blues and R&amp;B, the &quot;assemblage of disparate musical styles known ... as &#x27;classical music&#x27;&quot; has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre&#x27;s earliest days, and that metal&#x27;s &quot;most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music. Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity [and] changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal.&quot;

In an article written for &quot;Grove Music Online&quot;, Walser stated that the &quot;1980s brought on ... the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially Bach and Antonio Vivaldi, by influential guitarists such as Ritchie Blackmore, Marty Friedman, Jason Becker, Uli Jon Roth, Eddie Van Halen, Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen.&quot; Kurt Bachmann of Believer has stated that &quot;if done correctly, metal and classical fit quite well together. Classical and metal are probably the two genres that have the most in common when it comes to feel, texture, creativity.&quot;

Although a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices – classical in the art music tradition, metal in the popular music tradition. As musicologists Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note: &quot;Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of &#x27;art traditions.&#x27; An example is Walser&#x27;s linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century Romanticism. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from &quot;art music.&#x27;&quot;

===Lyrical themes===

According to David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired have concentrated lyrically &quot;on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music.&quot; They take as an example Black Sabbath&#x27;s second album, &quot;Paranoid&quot; (1970), which &quot;included songs dealing with personal trauma—&#x27;Paranoid&#x27; and &#x27;Fairies Wear Boots&#x27; (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)—as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory &#x27;War Pigs&#x27; and &#x27;Hand of Doom.&#x27;&quot; Deriving from the genre&#x27;s roots in blues music, sex is another important topic – a thread running from Led Zeppelin&#x27;s suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam metal and nu metal bands.
The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, &quot;Heavy metal&#x27;s main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates ... a party without limits ... [T]he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic.&quot; Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs. Andrew Cope stated that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are &quot;clearly misguided&quot; as these critics have &quot;overlook[ed] the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise&quot;. Music critic Robert Christgau called metal &quot;an expressive mode [that] it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they&#x27;ll never beat&quot;.

Heavy metal artists have had to defend their lyrics in front of the U.S. Senate and in court. In 1985, Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider was asked to defend his song &quot;Under the Blade&quot; at a U.S. Senate hearing. At the hearing, the PMRC alleged that the song was about sadomasochism and rape; Snider stated that the song was about his bandmate&#x27;s throat surgery. In 1986, Ozzy Osbourne was sued over the lyrics of his song &quot;Suicide Solution&quot;. A lawsuit against Osbourne was filed by the parents of John McCollum, a depressed teenager who committed suicide allegedly after listening to Osbourne&#x27;s song. Osbourne was not found to be responsible for the teen&#x27;s death. In 1990, Judas Priest was sued in American court by the parents of two young men who had shot themselves five years earlier, allegedly after hearing the subliminal statement &quot;do it&quot; in the band&#x27;s cover of the song &quot;Better by You, Better than Me&quot;. While the case attracted a great deal of media attention, it was ultimately dismissed. In 1991, U.K. police seized death metal records from the British record label Earache Records, in an &quot;unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the label for obscenity&quot;.

In some predominantly Muslim countries, heavy metal has been officially denounced as a threat to traditional values, and in countries such as Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon and Malaysia, there have been incidents of heavy metal musicians and fans being arrested and incarcerated. In 1997, the Egyptian police jailed many young metal fans, and they were accused of &quot;devil worship&quot; and blasphemy after police found metal recordings during searches of their homes. In 2013, Malaysia banned Lamb of God from performing in their country, on the grounds that the &quot;band&#x27;s lyrics could be interpreted as being religiously insensitive&quot; and blasphemous. Some people consider heavy metal music to be a leading factor for mental health disorders, and that heavy metal fans are more likely to suffer poor mental health, but a study from 2009 suggests that this is not true and that fans of heavy metal music suffer from poor mental health at a similar or lower rate compared to the general population.

===Image and fashion===
For many artists and bands, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal. In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band&#x27;s image is expressed in album cover art, logos, stage sets, clothing, design of instruments and music videos.

Down-the-back long hair is the &quot;most crucial distinguishing feature of metal fashion&quot;. Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s, heavy metal hair &quot;symbolised the hate, angst and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home&quot;, according to journalist Nader Rahman. Long hair gave members of the metal community &quot;the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general&quot;.

The classic uniform of heavy metal fans consists of light-colored, ripped, frayed or torn blue jeans, black T-shirts, boots, and black leather or denim jackets. Deena Weinstein wrote, &quot;T-shirts are generally emblazoned with the logos or other visual representations of favorite metal bands.&quot; In the 1980s, a range of sources – from punk rock and goth music to horror films – influenced metal fashion. Many metal performers of the 1970s and 1980s used radically shaped and brightly colored instruments to enhance their stage appearance.

Fashion and personal style was especially important for glam metal bands of the era. Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair (hence the nickname &quot;hair metal&quot;); makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry. Pioneered by the heavy metal act X Japan in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as visual kei, which includes many non-metal groups, emphasize elaborate costumes, hair and makeup.

===Physical gestures===

When performing live, many metal musicians – as well as the audience for whom they&#x27;re playing – engage in headbanging, which involves rhythmically beating time with the head, often emphasized by long hair. The &quot;il cornuto&quot;, or &quot;devil horns&quot;, hand gesture was popularized by vocalist Ronnie James Dio during his time with the bands Black Sabbath and Dio. Although Gene Simmons of Kiss claims to have been the first to make the gesture on the 1977 &quot;Love Gun&quot; album cover, there is speculation as to who started the phenomenon.

Attendees of metal concerts do not dance in the usual sense. It has been argued that this is due to the music&#x27;s largely male audience and &quot;extreme heterosexualist ideology&quot;. Two primary body movements used are headbanging and an arm thrust that is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture. The performance of air guitar is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home. According to Deena Weinstein, thrash metal concerts have two elements that are not part of the other metal genres: moshing and stage diving, which &quot;were imported from the punk/hardcore subculture&quot;. Weinstein states that moshing participants bump and jostle each other as they move in a circle in an area called the &quot;pit&quot; near the stage. Stage divers climb onto the stage with the band and then jump &quot;back into the audience&quot;.

===Fan subculture===

It has been argued that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due to the emergence of an intense, exclusionary and strongly masculine subculture. While the metal fan base is largely young, white, male and blue-collar, the group is &quot;tolerant of those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes of dress, appearance, and behavior&quot;. Identification with the subculture is strengthened not only by the group experience of concert-going and shared elements of fashion, but also by contributing to metal magazines and, more recently, websites. Attending live concerts in particular has been called the &quot;holiest of heavy metal communions&quot;.

The metal scene has been characterized as a &quot;subculture of alienation&quot; with its own code of authenticity. This code puts several demands on performers: they must appear both completely devoted to their music and loyal to the subculture that supports it; they must appear uninterested in mainstream appeal and radio hits; and they must never &quot;sell out&quot;. Deena Weinstein stated that for the fans themselves, the code promotes &quot;opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society&quot;.

Musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observed, &quot;Most of the kids who come to my shows seem like really imaginative kids with a lot of creative energy they don&#x27;t know what to do with&quot; and that metal is &quot;outsider music for outsiders. Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid. It&#x27;s kind of like that, but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place.&quot; Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as &quot;poseurs&quot; &quot;who pretended to be part of the subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity&quot;.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term &quot;heavy metal&quot; in a musical context is uncertain. The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy, where the periodic table organizes elements of both light and heavy metals (e.g., uranium). An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by countercultural writer William S. Burroughs. His 1961 novel &quot;The Soft Machine&quot; includes a character known as &quot;Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid&quot;. Burroughs&#x27; next novel, &quot;Nova Express&quot; (1964), develops the theme, using &quot;heavy metal&quot; as a metaphor for addictive drugs: &quot;With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms—Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes—And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music.&quot; Inspired by Burroughs&#x27; novels, the term was used in the title of the 1967 album &quot;Featuring the Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids&quot; by Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, which has been claimed to be its first use in the context of music. The phrase was later lifted by Sandy Pearlman, who used the term to describe the Byrds for their supposed &quot;aluminium style of context and effect&quot;, particularly on their album &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; (1968).

Metal historian Ian Christe describes what the components of the term mean in &quot;hippiespeak&quot;: &quot;heavy&quot; is roughly synonymous with &quot;potent&quot; or &quot;profound&quot;, and &quot;metal&quot; designates a certain type of mood, grinding and weighted as with metal. The word &quot;heavy&quot; in this sense was a basic element of beatnik and later countercultural hippie slang, and references to &quot;heavy music&quot; – typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare – were already common by the mid-1960s, such as in reference to Vanilla Fudge. Iron Butterfly&#x27;s debut album, which was released in early 1968, was titled &quot;Heavy&quot;. The first use of &quot;heavy metal&quot; in a song lyric is in reference to a motorcycle in the Steppenwolf song &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, also released that year: &quot;I like smoke and lightning / Heavy metal thunder / Racin&#x27; with the wind / And the feelin&#x27; that I&#x27;m under&quot;.

An early documented use of the phrase in rock criticism appears in Sandy Pearlman&#x27;s February 1967 &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; review of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Got Live If You Want It&quot; (1966), albeit as a description of the sound rather than as a genre: &quot;On this album the Stones go metal. Technology is in the saddle—as an ideal and as a method.&quot; Another appears in the 11 May 1968 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in which Barry Gifford wrote about the album &quot;A Long Time Comin&#x27;&quot; by U.S. band Electric Flag: &quot;Nobody who&#x27;s been listening to Mike Bloomfield—either talking or playing—in the last few years could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock.&quot; In the 7 September 1968 edition of the &quot;Seattle Daily Times&quot;, reviewer Susan Schwartz wrote that the Jimi Hendrix Experience &quot;has a heavy-metals blues sound&quot;. In January 1970, Lucian K. Truscott IV, reviewing &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; for the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, described the sound as &quot;heavy&quot; and made comparisons with Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge.

Other early documented uses of the phrase are from reviews by critic Metal Mike Saunders. In the 12 November 1970 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band Humble Pie: &quot;&quot;Safe as Yesterday Is,&quot; their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could be boring in lots of different ways. Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond doubt. There were a couple of nice songs ... and one monumental pile of refuse.&quot; He described the band&#x27;s latest, self-titled release as &quot;more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap&quot;.

In a review of Sir Lord Baltimore&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; in the May 1971 edition of &quot;Creem&quot;, Saunders wrote, &quot;Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book.&quot; &quot;Creem&quot; critic Lester Bangs is credited with popularizing the term via his early 1970s essays on bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Through the decade, &quot;heavy metal&quot; was used by certain critics as a virtually automatic putdown. In 1979, lead &quot;New York Times&quot; popular music critic John Rockwell described what he called &quot;heavy-metal rock&quot; as &quot;brutally aggressive music played mostly for minds clouded by drugs&quot; and, in a different article, as &quot;a crude exaggeration of rock basics that appeals to white teenagers&quot;.

Coined by Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward, &quot;downer rock&quot; was one of the earliest terms used to describe this style of music and was applied to acts such as Sabbath and Bloodrock. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine described the downer rock culture revolving around the use of Quaaludes and the drinking of wine. The term would later be replaced by &quot;heavy metal&quot;.

Earlier on, as &quot;heavy metal&quot; emerged partially from heavy psychedelic rock, also known as acid rock, &quot;acid rock&quot; was often used interchangeably with &quot;heavy metal&quot; and &quot;hard rock&quot;. &quot;Acid rock&quot; generally describes heavy, hard or raw psychedelic rock. Musicologist Steve Waksman stated that &quot;the distinction between acid rock, hard rock, and heavy metal can at some point never be more than tenuous&quot;, while percussionist John Beck defined &quot;acid rock&quot; as synonymous with hard rock and heavy metal.

Apart from &quot;acid rock&quot;, the terms &quot;heavy metal&quot; and &quot;hard rock&quot; have often been used interchangeably, particularly in discussing bands of the 1970s, a period when the terms were largely synonymous. For example, the 1983 edition of the &quot;Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; includes the following passage: &quot;Known for its aggressive blues-based hard-rock style, Aerosmith was the top American heavy-metal band of the mid-Seventies&quot;.

&quot;The term &#x27;heavy metal&#x27; is self-defeating,&quot; remarked Kiss bassist Gene Simmons. &quot;When I think of heavy metal, I&#x27;ve always thought of elves and evil dwarves and evil princes and princesses. A lot of the Maiden and Priest records were real metal records. I sure as hell don&#x27;t think Metallica&#x27;s metal, or Guns N&#x27; Roses is metal, or Kiss is metal. It just doesn&#x27;t deal with the ground opening up and little dwarves coming out riding dragons! You know, like bad Dio records.&quot;

==History==

===Antecedents: 1950s to late 1960s===

Heavy metal&#x27;s quintessential guitar style, which is built around distortion-heavy riffs and power chords, traces its roots to early 1950s Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson and particularly Pat Hare, who captured a &quot;grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound&quot; on records such as James Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Cotton Crop Blues&quot; (1954). Other early influences include the late 1950s instrumentals of Link Wray, particularly &quot;Rumble&quot; (1958); the early 1960s surf rock of Dick Dale, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Trippin&#x27;&quot; (1961) and &quot;Misirlou&quot; (1962); and the Kingsmen&#x27;s version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (1963), which became a garage rock standard.
However, the genre&#x27;s direct lineage begins in the mid-1960s. American blues music was a major influence on the early British rockers of the era. Bands like the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds developed blues rock by recording covers of classic blues songs, often speeding up the tempos. As they experimented with the music, the UK blues-based bands – and in turn the U.S. acts they influenced – developed what would become the hallmarks of heavy metal (in particular, the loud, distorted guitar sound). The Kinks played a major role in popularising this sound with their 1964 hit &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;.

In addition to the Kinks&#x27; Dave Davies, other guitarists such as the Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend and the Yardbirds&#x27; Jeff Beck were experimenting with feedback. Where the blues rock drumming style started out largely as simple shuffle beats on small kits, drummers began using a more muscular, complex and amplified approach to match and be heard against the increasingly loud guitar. Vocalists similarly modified their technique and increased their reliance on amplification, often becoming more stylized and dramatic. In terms of sheer volume, especially in live performance, the Who&#x27;s &quot;bigger-louder-wall-of-Marshalls&quot; approach was seminal to the development of the later heavy metal sound.

The combination of this loud and heavy blues rock with psychedelic rock and acid rock formed much of the original basis for heavy metal. The variant or subgenre of psychedelic rock often known as &quot;acid rock&quot; was particularly influential on heavy metal and its development; acid rock is often defined as a heavier, louder, or harder variant of psychedelic rock, or the more extreme side of the psychedelic rock genre, frequently containing a loud, improvised, and heavily distorted, guitar-centered sound. Acid rock has been described as psychedelic rock at its &quot;rawest and most intense&quot;, emphasizing the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the psychedelic experience rather than only the idyllic side of psychedelia. In contrast to more idyllic or whimsical pop psychedelic rock, American acid rock garage bands such as the 13th Floor Elevators epitomized the frenetic, heavier, darker, and more psychotic psychedelic rock sound known as acid rock, a sound characterized by droning guitar riffs, amplified feedback, and guitar distortion, while the 13th Floor Elevators&#x27; sound in particular featured yelping vocals and &quot;occasionally demented&quot; lyrics. Frank Hoffman noted that &quot;[Psychedelic rock] was sometimes referred to as &#x27;acid rock&#x27;. The latter label was applied to a pounding, hard rock variant that evolved out of the mid-1960s garage-punk movement... When rock began turning back to softer, roots-oriented sounds in late 1968, acid-rock bands mutated into heavy metal acts.&quot;

One of the most influential bands in forging the merger of psychedelic rock and acid rock with the blues rock genre was the British power trio Cream, who derived a massive, heavy sound from unison riffing between guitarist Eric Clapton and bassist Jack Bruce, as well as Ginger Baker&#x27;s double bass drumming. Their first two LPs – &quot;Fresh Cream&quot; (1966) and &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; (1967) – are regarded as essential prototypes for the future style of heavy metal. The Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; (1967), was also highly influential. Hendrix&#x27;s virtuosic technique would be emulated by many metal guitarists, and the album&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, is identified by some as the first heavy metal hit. Vanilla Fudge, whose first album also came out in 1967, has been called &quot;one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal,&quot; and the band has been cited as an early American heavy metal group. On their self-titled debut album, Vanilla Fudge created &quot;loud, heavy, slowed-down arrangements&quot; of contemporary hit songs, blowing these songs up to &quot;epic proportions&quot; and &quot;bathing them in a trippy, distorted haze&quot;.

During the late 1960s, many psychedelic singers, such as Arthur Brown, began to create outlandish, theatrical, and often macabre performances that influenced many metal acts. The American psychedelic rock band Coven, who opened for early heavy metal influencers such as Vanilla Fudge and the Yardbirds, portrayed themselves as practitioners of witchcraft or black magic, using dark – Satanic or occult – imagery in their lyrics, album art and live performances, which consisted of elaborate, theatrical &quot;Satanic rites&quot;. Coven&#x27;s 1969 debut album, &quot;Witchcraft Destroys Minds &amp; Reaps Souls&quot;, featured imagery of skulls, black masses, inverted crosses, and Satan worship, and both the album artwork and the band&#x27;s live performances marked the first appearances in rock music of the sign of the horns, which would later become an important gesture in heavy metal culture. Coven&#x27;s lyrical and thematic influences on heavy metal were quickly overshadowed by the darker and heavier sounds of Black Sabbath.

===Origins: late 1960s and early 1970s===

Critics disagree over who can be thought of as the first heavy metal band. Most credit the British bands Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, with American commentators tending to favour Led Zeppelin and British commentators tending to favour Black Sabbath, though many give equal credit to both. Deep Purple, the third band in what is sometimes considered the &quot;unholy trinity&quot; of heavy metal along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, fluctuated between many rock styles until late 1969 when they took a heavy metal direction. A few commentators – mainly American – argue for other groups, including Iron Butterfly, Steppenwolf, Blue Cheer, or Vanilla Fudge, as the first to play heavy metal.

In 1968, the sound that would become known as heavy metal began to coalesce. That January, San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a cover of Eddie Cochran&#x27;s classic &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; as a part of their debut album, &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot;, and many consider it to be the first true heavy metal recording. The same month, Steppenwolf released their self-titled debut album, on which the track &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; refers to &quot;heavy metal thunder&quot; in describing a motorcycle. In July, the Jeff Beck Group, whose leader had preceded Page as The Yardbirds&#x27; guitarist, released its debut record, &quot;Truth&quot;, which featured some of the &quot;most molten, barbed, downright funny noises of all time&quot;, breaking ground for generations of metal ax-slingers. In September, Page&#x27;s new band, Led Zeppelin, made its live debut in Denmark (but were billed as The New Yardbirds). The Beatles&#x27; self-titled double album, released in November, included &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, then one of the heaviest-sounding songs ever released by a major band. The Pretty Things&#x27; rock opera &quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot;, released in December, featured &quot;proto heavy metal&quot; songs such as &quot;Old Man Going&quot; and &quot;I See You&quot;. Iron Butterfly&#x27;s 1968 song &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; is sometimes described as an example of the transition between acid rock and heavy metal or the turning point in which acid rock became &quot;heavy metal&quot;, and both Iron Butterfly&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; and Blue Cheer&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot; have been described as laying the foundation of heavy metal and greatly influential in the transformation of acid rock into heavy metal.

In this counterculture period, MC5, who began as part of the Detroit garage rock scene, developed a raw, distorted style that has been seen as a major influence on the future sound of both heavy metal and later punk music. The Stooges also began to establish and influence a heavy metal and later punk sound, with songs such as &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot;, featuring pounding and distorted heavy guitar power chord riffs. Pink Floyd released two of their heaviest and loudest songs to date, &quot;Ibiza Bar&quot; and &quot;The Nile Song&quot;, the latter of which being regarded as &quot;one of the heaviest songs the band recorded.&quot; King Crimson&#x27;s debut album started with &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;, which was considered heavy metal by several critics.

In January 1969, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released and reached No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. In July, Led Zeppelin and a power trio with a Cream-inspired, but cruder sound, called Grand Funk Railroad played the Atlanta Pop Festival. That same month, another Cream-rooted trio led by Leslie West released &quot;Mountain&quot;, an album filled with heavy blues rock guitar and roaring vocals. In August, the group – now itself dubbed Mountain – played an hour-long set at the Woodstock Festival, exposing the crowd of 300,000 people to the emerging sound of heavy metal. Mountain&#x27;s proto-metal or early heavy metal hit song &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot; from the album &quot;Climbing!&quot; is especially credited with paving the way for heavy metal and was one of the first heavy guitar songs to receive regular play on radio. In September 1969, the Beatles released the album &quot;Abbey Road&quot; containing the track &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot;, which has been credited as an early example of or influence on heavy metal or doom metal. In October 1969, British band High Tide debuted with the heavy, proto-metal album &quot;Sea Shanties&quot;.

Led Zeppelin defined central aspects of the emerging genre, with Page&#x27;s highly distorted guitar style and singer Robert Plant&#x27;s dramatic, wailing vocals. Other bands, with a more consistently heavy, &quot;purely&quot; metal sound, would prove equally important in codifying the genre. The 1970 releases by Black Sabbath (&quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, which is generally accepted as the first heavy metal album, and &quot;Paranoid&quot;) and Deep Purple (&quot;Deep Purple in Rock&quot;) were crucial in this regard.

Birmingham&#x27;s Black Sabbath had developed a particularly heavy sound in part due to a work accident in which guitarist Tony Iommi lost the ends of two fingers. Unable to play normally, Iommi had to tune his guitar down for easier fretting and rely on power chords with their relatively simple fingering. The bleak, industrial, working-class environment of Birmingham, a manufacturing city full of noisy factories and metalworking, has itself been credited with influencing Black Sabbath&#x27;s heavy, chugging, metallic sound – and the sound of heavy metal in general.

Deep Purple had fluctuated between styles in its early years, but by 1969, vocalist Ian Gillan and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had led the band toward the developing heavy metal style. In 1970, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple scored major U.K. chart hits with &quot;Paranoid&quot; and &quot;Black Night&quot;, respectively. That same year, two other British bands released debut albums in a heavy metal mode: Uriah Heep with &quot;...Very &#x27;Eavy... Very &#x27;Umble&quot; and UFO with &quot;UFO 1&quot;. Bloodrock released their self-titled debut album, a collection of heavy guitar riffs, gruff style vocals and sadistic and macabre lyrics. The influential Budgie brought the new metal sound into a power trio context, creating some of the heaviest music of the time. The occult lyrics and imagery employed by Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep would prove particularly influential; Led Zeppelin also began foregrounding such elements with its fourth album, released in 1971. In 1973, Deep Purple released the song &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, whose iconic riff is usually considered as the most recognizable one in &quot;heavy rock&quot; history, as a single of the classic live album &quot;Made in Japan&quot;.
On the other side of the Atlantic, the trendsetting group was Grand Funk Railroad, who was described as &quot;the most commercially successful American heavy-metal band from 1970 until they disbanded in 1976, [they] established the Seventies success formula: continuous touring.&quot; Other influential bands identified with metal emerged in the U.S. such as Sir Lord Baltimore (&quot;Kingdom Come,&quot; 1970), Blue Öyster Cult (&quot;Blue Öyster Cult&quot;, 1972), Aerosmith (&quot;Aerosmith&quot;, 1973) and Kiss (&quot;Kiss&quot;, 1974). Sir Lord Baltimore&#x27;s 1970 debut album and both Humble Pie&#x27;s debut and self-titled third album were among the first albums to be described in print as &quot;heavy metal&quot;, with &quot;As Safe As Yesterday Is&quot; referred to by the term &quot;heavy metal&quot; in a 1970 review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. Various smaller bands from the U.S., U.K. and Continental Europe – including Bang, Josefus, Leaf Hound, Primeval, Hard Stuff, Truth and Janey, Dust, JPT Scare Band, Frijid Pink, Cactus, Irish Coffee, May Blitz, Captain Beyond, Toad, Granicus, Iron Claw, and Yesterday&#x27;s Children – though lesser known outside of their respective scenes, proved to be greatly influential on the emerging metal movement. In Germany, Scorpions debuted with &quot;Lonesome Crow&quot; in 1972. Blackmore, who had emerged as a virtuoso soloist with Deep Purple&#x27;s highly influential album &quot;Machine Head&quot; (1972), left the band in 1975 to form Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio, singer and bassist for blues rock band Elf and future vocalist for Black Sabbath and heavy metal band Dio. Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio would expand on the mystical and fantasy-based lyrics and themes sometimes found in heavy metal, pioneering both power metal and neoclassical metal. These bands also built audiences via constant touring and increasingly elaborate stage shows.

There are arguments about whether these and other early bands truly qualify as &quot;heavy metal&quot; or simply as &quot;hard rock&quot;. Those closer to the music&#x27;s blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. AC/DC, which debuted with &quot;High Voltage&quot; in 1975, is a prime example. The 1983 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; encyclopedia entry begins, &quot;Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC ...&quot; Rock historian Clinton Walker wrote, &quot;Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today... [They] were a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band that just happened to be heavy enough for metal.&quot; The issue is not only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification; Ian Christe describes how the band &quot;became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition&quot;.

In certain cases, there is little debate. After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain&#x27;s Judas Priest, which debuted with &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; in 1974. In Christe&#x27;s description,

Black Sabbath&#x27;s audience was... left to scavenge for sounds with similar impact. By the mid-1970s, heavy metal aesthetic could be spotted, like a mythical beast, in the moody bass and complex dual guitars of Thin Lizzy, in the stagecraft of Alice Cooper, in the sizzling guitar and showy vocals of Queen, and in the thundering medieval questions of Rainbow... Judas Priest arrived to unify and amplify these diverse highlights from hard rock&#x27;s sonic palette. For the first time, heavy metal became a true genre unto itself.

Though Judas Priest did not have a top 40 album in the United States until 1980, for many it was the definitive post-Sabbath heavy metal band; its twin-guitar attack, featuring rapid tempos and a non-bluesy, more cleanly metallic sound, was a major influence on later acts. While heavy metal was growing in popularity, most critics were not enamored of the music. Objections were raised to metal&#x27;s adoption of visual spectacle and other trappings of commercial artifice, but the main offense was its perceived musical and lyrical vacuity: reviewing a Black Sabbath album in the early 1970s, Robert Christgau described it as &quot;dull and decadent... dim-witted, amoral exploitation.&quot;

===Mainstream: late 1970s and 1980s===

Punk rock emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against contemporary social conditions as well as what was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal. Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, disco and more mainstream rock. With the major labels fixated on punk, many newer British heavy metal bands were inspired by the movement&#x27;s aggressive, high-energy sound and &quot;lo-fi&quot;, do it yourself ethos. Underground metal bands began putting out cheaply recorded releases independently to small, devoted audiences.

Motörhead, founded in 1975, was the first important band to straddle the punk/metal divide. With the explosion of punk in 1977, others followed. British music magazines such as the &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot; took notice, with &quot;Sounds&quot; writer Geoff Barton christening the movement the &quot;New Wave of British Heavy Metal&quot;. NWOBHM bands including Iron Maiden, Saxon and Def Leppard re-energized the heavy metal genre. Following the lead set by Judas Priest and Motörhead, they toughened up the sound, reduced its blues elements and emphasized increasingly fast tempos.

&quot;This seemed to be the resurgence of heavy metal,&quot; noted Ronnie James Dio, who joined Black Sabbath in 1979. &quot;I&#x27;ve never thought there was a &quot;desurgence&quot; of heavy metal – if that&#x27;s a word! – but it was important to me that, yet again &quot;[after Rainbow]&quot;, I could be involved in something that was paving the way for those who are going to come after me.&quot;

By 1980, the NWOBHM had broken into the mainstream, as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, as well as Motörhead, reached the British top 10. Though less commercially successful, NWOBHM bands such as Venom and Diamond Head would have a significant influence on metal&#x27;s development. In 1981, Motörhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the U.K. charts with the live album &quot;No Sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith&quot;.

The first generation of metal bands was ceding the limelight. Deep Purple broke up soon after Blackmore&#x27;s departure in 1975, and Led Zeppelin split following drummer John Bonham&#x27;s death in 1980. Black Sabbath were plagued with infighting and substance abuse, while facing fierce competition from their opening band, Van Halen. Eddie Van Halen established himself as one of the leading metal guitarists of the era. His solo on &quot;Eruption&quot;, from the band&#x27;s self-titled 1978 album, is considered a milestone. Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s sound even crossed over into pop music when his guitar solo was featured on the track &quot;Beat It&quot; by Michael Jackson, which reached No. 1 in the U.S. in February 1983.

Inspired by Van Halen&#x27;s success, a metal scene began to develop in Southern California during the late 1970s. Based on the clubs of L.A.&#x27;s Sunset Strip, bands such as Mötley Crüe, Quiet Riot, Ratt and W.A.S.P. were influenced by traditional heavy metal of the 1970s. These acts incorporated the theatrics (and sometimes makeup) of glam metal or &quot;hair metal&quot; bands such as Alice Cooper and Kiss. Glam metal bands were often visually distinguished by long, overworked hairstyles accompanied by wardrobes which were sometimes considered cross-gender. The lyrics of these glam metal bands characteristically emphasized hedonism and wild behavior, including lyrics that involved sexual expletives and the use of narcotics.
In the wake of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and Judas Priest&#x27;s breakthrough with &quot;British Steel&quot; (1980), heavy metal became increasingly popular in the early 1980s. Many metal artists benefited from the exposure they received on MTV, which began airing in 1981; sales often soared if a band&#x27;s videos screened on the channel. Def Leppard&#x27;s videos for &quot;Pyromania&quot; (1983) made them superstars in America, and Quiet Riot became the first domestic heavy metal band to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart with &quot;Metal Health&quot; (1983). One of the seminal events in metal&#x27;s growing popularity was the 1983 US Festival in California, where the &quot;heavy metal day&quot; featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, Mötley Crüe, Judas Priest and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.

Between 1983 and 1984, heavy metal&#x27;s share of all recordings sold in the U.S. increased from 8% to 20%. Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched, including &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 1981 and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; in 1984, as well as a host of fan journals. In 1985, &quot;Billboard&quot; declared: &quot;Metal has broadened its audience base. Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers. The metal audience has become older (college-aged), younger (pre-teen), and more female.&quot;

By the mid-1980s, glam metal was a dominant presence on the U.S. charts, music television and the arena concert circuit. New bands such as L.A.&#x27;s Warrant and acts from the East Coast like Poison and Cinderella became major draws, while Mötley Crüe and Ratt remained very popular. Bridging the stylistic gap between hard rock and glam metal, New Jersey&#x27;s Bon Jovi became enormously successful with its third album, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; (1986). The similarly styled Swedish band Europe became international stars with &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1986), whose title track hit No. 1 in 25 countries. In 1987, MTV launched &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, a show devoted exclusively to heavy metal videos. However, the metal audience had begun to factionalize, with those in many underground metal scenes favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular style as &quot;light metal&quot; or &quot;hair metal&quot;.

One band that reached diverse audiences was Guns N&#x27; Roses. With the release of their chart-topping album &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; in 1987, they &quot;recharged and almost single-handedly sustained the Sunset Strip sleaze system for several years&quot;. The following year, Jane&#x27;s Addiction emerged from the same L.A. hard-rock club scene with their major-label debut, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot;. Reviewing the album, Steve Pond of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; declared, &quot;As much as any band in existence, Jane&#x27;s Addiction is the true heir to Led Zeppelin.&quot; The group was one of the first to be identified with the &quot;alternative metal&quot; trend that would come to the fore in the next decade. Meanwhile, new bands like New York City&#x27;s Winger and New Jersey&#x27;s Skid Row sustained the popularity of the glam metal style.

===Other heavy metal genres: 1980s, 1990s and 2000s===

Many subgenres of heavy metal developed outside of the commercial mainstream during the 1980s, such as crossover thrash. Several attempts have been made to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by the editors of AllMusic, as well as critic Garry Sharpe-Young. Sharpe-Young&#x27;s multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: thrash metal, death metal, black metal, power metal and the related subgenres of doom and gothic metal.

In 1990, a review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; suggested retiring the term &quot;heavy metal&quot; as the genre was &quot;ridiculously vague&quot;. The article stated that the term only fueled &quot;misperceptions of rock &amp; roll bigots who still assume that five bands as different as Ratt, Extreme, Anthrax, Danzig and Mother Love Bone&quot; sound the same.

====Thrash metal====
Thrash metal emerged in the early 1980s under the influence of hardcore punk and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, particularly songs in the revved-up style known as speed metal. The movement began in the United States, with Bay Area thrash metal being the leading scene. The sound developed by thrash groups was faster and more aggressive than that of the original metal bands and their glam metal successors. Low-register guitar riffs are typically overlaid with shredding leads. Lyrics often express nihilistic views or deal with social issues using visceral, gory language. Thrash has been described as a form of &quot;urban blight music&quot; and &quot;a palefaced cousin of rap&quot;.

The subgenre was popularized by the &quot;Big Four of Thrash&quot;: Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer. Three German bands, Kreator, Sodom and Destruction, played a central role in bringing the style to Europe. Others, including the San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s Testament and Exodus, New Jersey&#x27;s Overkill, and Brazil&#x27;s Sepultura and Sarcófago, also had a significant impact. Although thrash metal began as an underground movement, and remained largely that for almost a decade, the leading bands of the scene began to reach a wider audience. Metallica brought the sound into the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart in 1986 with &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, the genre&#x27;s first Platinum record. Two years later, the band&#x27;s album &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; hit No. 6, while Megadeth and Anthrax also had top 40 records on the American charts.

Though less commercially successful than the rest of the Big Four, Slayer released one of the genre&#x27;s definitive records: &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; (1986) was credited for incorporating heavier guitar timbres and including explicit depictions of death, suffering, violence and occult into thrash metal&#x27;s lyricism. Slayer attracted a following among far-right skinheads, and accusations of promoting violence and Nazi themes have dogged the band. Even though Slayer did not receive substantial media exposure, their music played a key role in the development of extreme metal.

In the early 1990s, bands that got their start in thrash metal achieved breakout success, challenging and redefining the metal mainstream. Metallica&#x27;s self-titled 1991 album topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, as the band established an international following. Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; (1992) debuted at No. 2, Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10, and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.

====Death metal====

Thrash metal soon began to evolve and split into more extreme metal genres. &quot;Slayer&#x27;s music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal,&quot; according to MTV News. The NWOBHM band Venom was also an important progenitor. The death metal movement in both North America and Europe adopted and emphasized the elements of blasphemy and diabolism employed by such acts. Florida&#x27;s Death, San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s Possessed and Ohio&#x27;s Necrophagia are recognized as seminal bands in the style. All three have been credited with inspiring the subgenre&#x27;s name. Possessed in particular did so via their 1984 demo, &quot;Death Metal&quot;, and their song &quot;Death Metal&quot;, which came from their 1985 debut album, &quot;Seven Churches&quot;. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swedish death metal became notable and melodic forms of death metal were created.

Death metal utilizes the speed and aggression of both thrash and hardcore, fused with lyrics preoccupied with Z-grade slasher movie violence and Satanism. Death metal vocals are typically bleak, involving guttural &quot;death growls&quot;, high-pitched screaming, the &quot;death rasp&quot; and other uncommon techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genre—Death Metal/Black Metal&quot;&gt;[ &quot;Genre—Death Metal/Black Metal&quot;]. AllMusic. Retrieved on 27 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Complementing the deep, aggressive vocal style are down-tuned, heavily distorted guitars and extremely fast percussion, often with rapid double bass drumming and &quot;wall of sound&quot;–style blast beats. Frequent tempo and time signature changes and syncopation are also typical.

Death metal, like thrash metal, generally rejects the theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets. One major exception to this rule was Deicide&#x27;s Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the U.K., the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.

====Black metal====
The first wave of black metal emerged in Europe in the early and mid-1980s, led by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Venom, Denmark&#x27;s Mercyful Fate, Switzerland&#x27;s Hellhammer and Celtic Frost, and Sweden&#x27;s Bathory. By the late 1980s, Norwegian bands such as Mayhem and Burzum were heading a second wave. Black metal varies considerably in style and production quality, although most bands emphasize shrieked and growled vocals, highly distorted guitars frequently played with rapid tremolo picking, a dark atmosphere and intentionally lo-fi production, often with ambient noise and background hiss.

Satanic themes are common in black metal, though many bands take inspiration from ancient paganism, promoting a return to supposed pre-Christian values. Numerous black metal bands also &quot;experiment with sounds from all possible forms of metal, folk, classical music, electronica and avant-garde&quot;. Darkthrone drummer Fenriz explained: &quot;It had something to do with production, lyrics, the way they dressed and a commitment to making ugly, raw, grim stuff. There wasn&#x27;t a generic sound.&quot;

Although bands such as Sarcófago had been donning corpsepaint, by 1990, Mayhem was regularly wearing it; many other black metal acts also adopted the look. Bathory inspired the Viking metal and folk metal movements, and Immortal brought blast beats to the fore. Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable violence in the early 1990s, with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry.

By 1992, black metal scenes had begun to emerge in areas outside Scandinavia, including Germany, France and Poland. The 1993 murder of Mayhem&#x27;s Euronymous by Burzum&#x27;s Varg Vikernes provoked intensive media coverage. Around 1996, when many in the scene felt the genre was stagnating, several key bands, including Burzum and Finland&#x27;s Beherit, moved toward an ambient style, while symphonic black metal was explored by Sweden&#x27;s Tiamat and Switzerland&#x27;s Samael. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Norway&#x27;s Dimmu Borgir and England&#x27;s Cradle of Filth brought black metal closer to the mainstream.

====Power metal====
During the late 1980s, the power metal scene came together largely in reaction to the harshness of death and black metal. Though a relatively underground style in North America, it enjoys wide popularity in Europe, Japan and South America. Power metal focuses on upbeat, epic melodies and themes that &quot;appeal to the listener&#x27;s sense of valor and loveliness&quot;. The prototype for the sound was established in the mid- to late 1980s by Germany&#x27;s Helloween, who, in their 1987 and 1988 &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys&quot; albums, combined the power riffs, melodic approach and a high-pitched, &quot;clean&quot; singing style of bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden with thrash&#x27;s speed and energy, &quot;crystalliz[ing] the sonic ingredients of what is now known as power metal&quot;.

Traditional power metal bands like Sweden&#x27;s HammerFall, England&#x27;s DragonForce and the U.S.&#x27;s Iced Earth have a sound clearly indebted to the classic NWOBHM style. Many power metal bands such as the U.S.&#x27;s Kamelot, Finland&#x27;s Nightwish, Stratovarius and Sonata Arctica, Italy&#x27;s Rhapsody of Fire and Russia&#x27;s Catharsis feature a keyboard-based &quot;symphonic&quot; sound, sometimes employing orchestras and opera singers. Power metal has built a strong fanbase in Japan and South America, where bands like Brazil&#x27;s Angra and Argentina&#x27;s Rata Blanca are popular.

Closely related to power metal is progressive metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson. This style emerged in the United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning and Dream Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey&#x27;s Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo is among the most recognized of latter-day shredders.

====Doom metal====
Emerging in the mid-1980s with such bands as California&#x27;s Saint Vitus, Maryland&#x27;s The Obsessed, Chicago&#x27;s Trouble and Sweden&#x27;s Candlemass, the doom metal movement rejected other metal styles&#x27; emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl. Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath. The Melvins have also been a significant influence on doom metal and a number of its subgenres. Doom metal emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of metal.

The 1991 release of &quot;Forest of Equilibrium&quot;, the debut album by U.K. band Cathedral, helped spark a new wave of doom metal. During the same period, the doom-death fusion style of British bands Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride and Anathema gave rise to European gothic metal. with its signature dual-vocalist arrangements, exemplified by Norway&#x27;s Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania. New York&#x27;s Type O Negative introduced an American take on the style.

In the United States, sludge metal, which mixes doom metal and hardcore punk, emerged in the late 1980s; Eyehategod and Crowbar were leaders in a major Louisiana sludge scene. Early in the next decade, California&#x27;s Kyuss and Sleep, inspired by the earlier doom metal bands, spearheaded the rise of stoner metal, while Seattle&#x27;s Earth helped develop the drone metal subgenre. The late 1990s saw new bands form such as the Los Angeles–based Goatsnake, with a classic stoner/doom sound, and Sunn O))), which crosses lines between doom, drone and dark ambient metal; the &quot;New York Times&quot; has compared their sound to an &quot;Indian raga in the middle of an earthquake&quot;.

===1990s and early 2000s subgenres and fusions===

Glam metal fell out of favor with the popular breakthrough of grunge and alternative rock, but as well as the growing popularity of the more aggressive sound typified by Metallica and the post-thrash groove metal of Pantera and White Zombie.

Grunge acts were influenced by the heavy metal sound, but rejected the excesses of the more popular metal bands, such as their &quot;flashy and virtuosic solos&quot; and &quot;appearance-driven&quot; MTV orientation. In 1991, Metallica released their album &quot;Metallica&quot;, also known as &quot;The Black Album&quot;, which moved the band&#x27;s sound out of the thrash metal genre and into standard heavy metal. The album was certified 16× Platinum by the RIAA. A few new, unambiguously metal bands had commercial success during the first half of the decade – Pantera&#x27;s &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in 1994 – but, &quot;In the dull eyes of the mainstream, metal was dead.&quot; Some bands tried to adapt to the new musical landscape. Metallica revamped its image: the band members cut their hair and, in 1996, headlined the alternative music festival Lollapalooza, which was founded by Jane&#x27;s Addiction singer Perry Farrell. While this prompted a backlash among some longtime fans, Metallica remained one of the most successful bands in the world into the new century.

Like Jane&#x27;s Addiction, many of the most popular early 1990s groups with roots in heavy metal fall under the umbrella term &quot;alternative metal&quot;. Bands in Seattle&#x27;s grunge scene such as Soundgarden are credited for making a &quot;place for heavy metal in alternative rock&quot;, and Alice in Chains were at the center of the alternative metal movement. The label was applied to a wide spectrum of other acts that fused metal with different styles: Faith No More combined their alternative rock sound with punk, funk, metal and hip-hop; Primus joined elements of funk, punk, thrash metal and experimental music; Tool mixed metal and progressive rock; bands such as Fear Factory, Ministry and Nine Inch Nails began incorporating metal into their industrial sound (and vice versa); and Marilyn Manson went down a similar route, while also employing shock effects of the sort popularized by Alice Cooper. Alternative metal artists, though they did not represent a cohesive scene, were united by their willingness to experiment with the metal genre and their rejection of glam metal aesthetics (with the stagecraft of Marilyn Manson and White Zombie – also identified with alt metal – significant, if partial, exceptions). Alternative metal&#x27;s mix of styles and sounds represented &quot;the colorful results of metal opening up to face the outside world&quot;.

In the mid- and late 1990s came a new wave of U.S. metal groups inspired by the alternative metal bands and their mix of genres. Dubbed &quot;nu metal&quot;, bands such as Slipknot, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, P.O.D., Korn and Disturbed incorporated elements ranging from death metal to hip-hop, often including DJs and rap-style vocals. The mix demonstrated that &quot;pancultural metal could pay off&quot;. Nu metal gained mainstream success through heavy MTV rotation and Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s 1996 introduction of Ozzfest, which led the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal. In 1999, &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that there were more than 500 specialty metal radio shows in the U.S., nearly three times as many as 10 years before. While nu metal was widely popular, traditional metal fans did not fully embrace the style. By early 2003, the movement&#x27;s popularity was on the wane, though several nu metal acts such as Korn or Limp Bizkit retained substantial followings.

===Recent styles: mid- to late 2000s, 2010s and 2020s===

Metalcore, a hybrid of extreme metal and hardcore punk, emerged as a commercial force in the mid-2000s, having mostly been an underground phenomenon throughout the 1980s and 1990s; pioneering bands include Earth Crisis, Converge, Hatebreed and Shai Hulud. By 2004, melodic metalcore – influenced by melodic death metal as well – was popular enough that Killswitch Engage&#x27;s &quot;The End of Heartache&quot; and Shadows Fall&#x27;s &quot;The War Within&quot; debuted at No. 21 and No. 20, respectively, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart.
Evolving even further from metalcore came mathcore, a more rhythmically complicated and progressive style brought to light by bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge and Protest the Hero. Mathcore&#x27;s main defining quality is the use of odd time signatures, and has been described to possess rhythmic comparability to free jazz.

Heavy metal remained popular in the 2000s, particularly in continental Europe. By the new millennium, Scandinavia had emerged as one of the areas producing innovative and successful bands, while Belgium, the Netherlands and especially Germany were the most significant markets. Metal music is more favorably embraced in Scandinavia and Northern Europe than other regions due to social and political openness in these regions; Finland in particular has been often called the &quot;Promised Land of Heavy Metal&quot;, as there are more than 50 metal bands for every 100,000 inhabitants – more than any other nation in the world. Established continental metal bands that placed multiple albums in the top 20 of the German charts between 2003 and 2008 include Finland&#x27;s Children of Bodom, Norway&#x27;s Dimmu Borgir, Germany&#x27;s Blind Guardian and Sweden&#x27;s HammerFall.

In the 2000s, an extreme metal fusion genre known as deathcore emerged. Deathcore incorporates elements of death metal, hardcore punk and metalcore. Deathcore features characteristics such as death metal riffs, hardcore punk breakdowns, death growling, &quot;pig squeal&quot;-sounding vocals and screaming. Deathcore bands include Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, Despised Icon and Carnifex.

The term &quot;retro-metal&quot; has been used to describe bands such as Texas-based The Sword, California&#x27;s High on Fire, Sweden&#x27;s Witchcraft and Australia&#x27;s Wolfmother. The Sword&#x27;s &quot;Age of Winters&quot; (2006) drew heavily on the work of Black Sabbath and Pentagram, Witchcraft added elements of folk rock and psychedelic rock, and Wolfmother&#x27;s self-titled 2005 debut album had &quot;Deep Purple-ish organs&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Page-worthy chordal riffing&quot;. Mastodon, which plays a progressive/sludge style of metal, has inspired claims of a metal revival in the United States, dubbed by some critics the &quot;New Wave of American Heavy Metal&quot;.

By the early 2010s, metalcore was evolving to more frequently incorporate synthesizers and elements from genres beyond rock and metal. The album &quot;Reckless &amp; Relentless&quot; by British band Asking Alexandria, which sold 31,000 copies in its first week, and The Devil Wears Prada&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Dead Throne&quot;, which sold 32,400 in its first week, reached No. 9 and No. 10, respectively, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In 2013, British band Bring Me the Horizon released their fourth studio album, &quot;Sempiternal&quot;, to critical acclaim. The album debuted at No. 3 on the U.K. Album Chart and at No. 1 in Australia. The album sold 27,522 copies in the U.S. and charted at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Chart, making it their highest-charting release in America until their follow-up album, &quot;That&#x27;s the Spirit&quot;, which debuted at No. 2 in 2015.

Also in the 2010s, a metal style called &quot;djent&quot; developed as a spinoff of standard progressive metal. Djent music uses rhythmic and technical complexity, heavily distorted, palm-muted guitar chords, syncopated riffs and polyrhythms alongside virtuoso soloing. Another typical characteristic is the use of extended range seven-, eight- and nine-string guitars. Djent bands include Periphery, Tesseract and Textures.

Fusion of nu metal with electropop by singer-songwriters Poppy, Grimes and Rina Sawayama saw a popular and critical revival of the former genre in the late 2010s and 2020s, particular on their respective albums &quot;I Disagree,&quot; &quot;Miss Anthropocene&quot; and &quot;Sawayama&quot;.

==Global reach==

Metal has been recognized as a global music genre, being listened to and performed around the world. Laina Dawes explored the multidimensional components of racism in her book &quot;What Are You Doing Here?&quot;, including the perspectives of black women musicians and fans, in the heavy metal scene in North America and the United Kingdom. She also grounded her doctorial thesis &quot;&#x27;Freedom Ain&#x27;t Free&#x27;: Race and Representation(s) in Extreme Heavy Metal&quot; on her own experiences, laying out some the nuances of a community that can be both a site of exclusionism and at the same time also a place for greater freedom of expression compared to mainstream genres. The band Alien Weaponry from the Māori people of New Zealand promotes heavy metal music as one way of combating racism.

==Women in heavy metal==

Women&#x27;s involvement in heavy metal began in the 1960s since its very conception, given the role played by Esther &quot;Jinx&quot; Dawson, vocalist and leader of Coven. The next milestone took place in the 1970s when Genesis, the forerunner of Vixen, formed in 1973. A hard rock band featuring all-female members, The Runaways, was founded in 1975; Joan Jett and Lita Ford later had successful solo careers. In 1978, during the rise of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, the band Girlschool was founded and, in 1980, collaborated with Motörhead under the pseudonym Headgirl. Starting in 1982, Doro Pesch, dubbed &quot;the Metal Queen&quot;, reached success across Europe (making other woman-fronted metal bands to spawn, such as Spain&#x27;s Santa in 1983), leading the German band Warlock before starting her solo career. In 1983 another pioneering heavy metal singer, Mari Hamada, made her debut, achieving great success in Japan from the 1980s until well into the 21st century. Debuting as the female lead singer of the American band Chastain in 1985, Leather Leone was a pioneer in power metal vocals. In 1986, the German thrash band Holy Moses, fronted by pioneer growler Sabina Classen, issued their first album. 

Bolt Thrower&#x27;s bassist Jo Bench since 1987 has inspired female musicians to play metal. Other women who have played instruments in otherwise male-dominated metal bands include Shirley Temple&#x27;s daughter Lori Black (Melvins), Kate Reddy of Krishnacore band 108 and Kim Deal (Pixies). 

In 1994, Liv Kristine joined Norwegian gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy, providing &quot;angelic&quot; female clean vocals to contrast with male death growls. In 1996, Finnish band Nightwish was founded and featured Tarja Turunen&#x27;s vocals. This was followed by more women fronting heavy metal bands, such as Halestorm, In This Moment, Within Temptation, Arch Enemy and Epica among others. Liv Kristine was featured on the title track of Cradle of Filth&#x27;s 2004 album, &quot;Nymphetamine&quot;, which was nominated for the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. In 2013, Halestorm won the Grammy in the combined category of Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance for &quot;Love Bites (So Do I)&quot;. In 2021, In This Moment, Code Orange and Poppy were all nominated in the Best Metal Performance category.

The most notable of these 1990s/2000s female-fronted groups was the American band Evanescence, headed by vocalist Amy Lee and featuring a musical style usually described as gothic alternative metal and hard rock with classical elements. Their first album Fallen, released in 2003, broke into the popular music scene and was a worldwide phenomenon; it earned the band two Grammy Awards and briefly catapulted Lee to a level of fame similar to that of contemporary popstars such as Christina Aguilera, Avril Lavigne, and Beyoncé. Although their later albums have not had a similar impact, Evanescence are still one of the most commercially successful metal groups of the 21st century, having sold over 20 million records.

In Japan, the 2010s saw a boom of all-female metal bands, including Destrose, Aldious, Mary&#x27;s Blood, Cyntia and Lovebites, as well as the mainstream success of Babymetal.

Women such as Gaby Hoffmann and Sharon Osbourne have held important managerial roles behind the scenes. In 1981, Hoffmann helped Don Dokken acquire his first record deal, as well as became the manager of Accept in 1981 and wrote songs under the pseudonym of &quot;Deaffy&quot; for many of band&#x27;s studio albums. Vocalist Mark Tornillo stated that Hoffmann still had some influence in songwriting on their later albums. Osbourne, the wife and manager of Ozzy Osbourne, founded the Ozzfest music festival and managed several bands, including Motörhead, Coal Chamber, the Smashing Pumpkins, Electric Light Orchestra, Lita Ford and Queen.

=== Sexism ===
The popular media and academia have long charged heavy metal with sexism and misogyny. In the 1980s, American conservative groups like the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) and the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) co-opted feminist views on anti-woman violence to form attacks on metal&#x27;s rhetoric and imagery. According to Robert Christgau in 2001, metal, along with hip-hop, have made &quot;reflexive and violent sexism... current in the music&quot;.

In response to such claims, debates in the metal press have centered on defining and contextualizing sexism. Hill claims that &quot;understanding what counts as sexism is complex and requires critical work by fans when sexism is normalised.&quot; Citing her own research, including interviews of British female fans, she found that metal offers them an opportunity to feel liberated and genderless, albeit if assimilated into a culture that is largely neglectful of women.

In 2018, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; editor Eleanor Goodman published an article titled &quot;Does Metal Have a Sexism Problem?&quot; interviewing veteran industry people and artists about the plight of women in metal. Some talked about a history of difficulty receiving professional respect from male counterparts. Among those interviewed was Wendy Dio, who had worked in label, booking and legal capacities in the music industry before her marriage to and management of metal artist Ronnie James Dio. She said that after marrying Dio, her professional reputation became reduced to her marital role as his wife, and her competency was questioned. Gloria Cavalera, former manager of Sepultura and wife of the band&#x27;s former frontman Max Cavalera, said that since 1996, she had received misogynistic hate mail and death threats from fans and that &quot;women take a lot of crap. This whole #MeToo thing, do they think it just started? That has gone on since the pictures of the cavemen pulling girls by their hair.&quot;

<text>The Helvetii ( , Gaulish: *&quot;Heluētī&quot;), anglicized as Helvetians, were a Celtic tribe or tribal confederation occupying most of the Swiss plateau at the time of their contact with the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. According to Julius Caesar, the Helvetians were divided into four subgroups or &quot;pagi.&quot; Of these, Caesar names only the Verbigeni and the Tigurini, while Posidonius mentions the Tigurini and the Tougeni (). They feature prominently in the &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War,&quot; with their failed migration attempt to southwestern Gaul (58 BC) serving as a catalyst for Caesar&#x27;s conquest of Gaul.

The Helvetians were subjugated after 52 BC, and under Augustus, Celtic oppida, such as Vindonissa or Basilea, were re-purposed as garrisons. In AD 68, a Helvetian uprising was crushed by Aulus Caecina Alienus.
The Swiss plateau was at first incorporated into the Roman province of Gallia Belgica (22 BC), later into Germania Superior (AD 83).
The Helvetians, like the rest of Gaul, were largely Romanized by the 2nd century. 
In the later 3rd century, Roman control over the region waned, and the Swiss plateau was exposed to the invading Alemanni. The Alemanni and Burgundians established permanent settlements in the Swiss plateau in the 5th and 6th centuries, resulting in the early medieval territories of Alemannia (Swabia) and Upper Burgundy. The Helvetii were largely assimilated by their new rulers, contributing to the ethnogenesis of modern Swiss people.

== Name ==
They are mentioned as &quot;Helvetii&quot; by Cicero (mid-1st c. BC), Caesar (mid-1st c. BC) and Tacitus (early 2nd c. AD), in the genitive case as &quot;Helvetiorum&quot; by Livy (late 1st c. BC), as &quot;Helveti&quot; by Pliny (mid-1st c. AD), and as &quot;Elouḗtioi&quot; (Ἐλουήτιοι) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD).

The Gaulish ethnic name &quot;Helvetii&quot; is generally interpreted as &quot;(h)elu-ētioi&quot; (&#x27;rich in land&#x27;), from &quot;elu&quot;- (&#x27;numerous&#x27;, cf. OIr. &quot;il&quot;) attached to &quot;etu&quot;- (&#x27;grassland&#x27;; cf. OIr. &quot;iath&quot;). The presence of the initial &quot;h&quot;-, remnant of a previous &quot;p&quot;- (PIE &quot;*pelh1u-&quot; &gt; Celt. &quot;helu-&quot; &gt; &quot;elu-&quot;), attests of an archaic formation.

The earliest attestation of the name is found in a &quot;graffito&quot; on a vessel from Mantua, dated to c. 300 BC. The inscription in Etruscan letters reads &quot;eluveitie,&quot; which has been interpreted as the Etruscan form of the Celtic &quot;elu̯eti̯os&quot; (&quot;the Helvetian&quot;), presumably referring to a man of Helvetian descent living in Mantua.

== Tribal organisation ==
Of the four Helvetian &quot;pagi&quot; or sub-tribes, Caesar names only the Verbigeni (&quot;Bell. Gall.&quot; 1.27) and the Tigurini (1.12), Posidonius the Tigurini and the Tougeni (). 
There has been substantial debate in Swiss historiography (beginning with Felix Stähelin 1927) on whether the Tougeni may or may not be identified with the Teutones mentioned by Titus Livius.

According to Caesar, the territory abandoned by the Helvetii had comprised 400 villages and 12 &quot;oppida&quot; (fortified settlements). His tally of the total population taken from captured Helvetian records written in Greek is 263,000 people, including fighting men, old men, women and children. However, the figures are generally dismissed as too high by modern scholars (see hereafter).

Like many other tribes, the Helvetii did not have kings at the time of their clash with Rome but instead seem to have been governed by a class of noblemen (Lat. &quot;equites&quot;). When Orgetorix, one of their most prominent and ambitious noblemen, was making plans to establish himself as their king, he faced execution at the stake if found guilty. Caesar does not explicitly name the tribal authorities prosecuting the case and gathering men to apprehend Orgetorix, but he refers to them by the Latin terms &quot;civitas&quot; (&quot;state&quot; or &quot;tribe&quot;) and &quot;magistratus&quot; (&quot;officials&quot;).

== History ==

=== Earliest historical sources and settlement ===

In his &quot;Natural History&quot; (c. 77 AD), Pliny provides a foundation myth for the Celtic settlement of Cisalpine Gaul in which a Helvetian named Helico plays the role of culture hero. Helico had worked in Rome as a craftsman and then returned to his home north of the Alps with a dried fig, a grape, and some oil and wine, the desirability of which caused his countrymen to invade northern Italy.

The Greek historian Posidonius (c. 135–50 BC), whose work is preserved only in fragments by other writers, offers the earliest historical record of the Helvetii. Posidonius described the Helvetians of the late 2nd century BC as &quot;rich in gold but peaceful,&quot; without giving clear indication to the location of their territory. His reference to gold washing in rivers has been taken as evidence for an early presence of the Helvetii in the Swiss plateau, with the Emme as being one of the gold-yielding rivers mentioned by Posidonius. This interpretation is now generally discarded, as Posidonius&#x27; narrative makes it more likely that the country some of the Helvetians left in order to join in the raids of the Teutones, Cimbri, and Ambrones was in fact southern Germany and not Switzerland.

That the Helvetians originally lived in southern Germany is confirmed by the Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemaios (c. 90–168 AD), who tells us of an Ἐλουητίων ἔρημος (i.e. &quot;Helvetic deserted lands&quot;) north of the Rhine. Tacitus knows that the Helvetians once settled in the swath between Rhine, Main, and the Hercynian forest. The abandonment of this northern territory is now usually placed in the late 2nd century BC, around the time of the first Germanic incursions into the Roman world, when the Tigurini and Toygenoi/Toutonoi are mentioned as participants in the great raids.

At the later Vicus &quot;Turicum&quot;, probably in the first 1st century BC or even much earlier, the Celts settled at the Lindenhof Oppidium. In 1890, so-called &quot;Potin lumps&quot; were found, whose largest weights at the Prehistoric pile dwelling settlement &quot;Alpenquai&quot; in Zürich, Switzerland. The pieces consist of a large number of fused Celtic coins, which are mixed with charcoal remnants. Some of the 18,000 coins originate from the &quot;Eastern Gaul&quot;, others are of the &quot;Zürich&quot; type, that were assigned to the local &quot;Helvetii&quot;, which date to around 100 BC. The find is so far unique, and the scientific research assumes that the melting down of the lump was not completed, therefore the aim was to form cultic offerings. The site of the find was at that time at least from the lake shore, and probably to three meters deep in the water. There&#x27;s also an island sanctuary of the Helvetii in connection with the settlement at the preceding Oppidi Uetliberg on the former &quot;Grosser Hafner&quot; island, as well as the settlement &quot;Kleiner Hafner&quot; at the &quot;Sechseläuten square&quot; on the effluence of the Limmat on Zürichsee lake shore.

=== First contact with the Romans ===
The Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and Ambrones probably reached southern Germany around the year 111 BC, where they were joined by the Tigurini, and, probably the Teutoni-Toutonoi-Toygenoi. (The precise identity of the latter group is unclear).

The tribes began a joint invasion of Gaul, including the Roman Provincia Narbonensis. A Roman army under the consul L. Cassius Longinus opposed them. At the Battle of Burdigala near Agendicum in 107 BC, the Tigurini killed Longinus and captured many of his soldiers. According to Caesar, the captured Roman soldiers were ordered to pass under a yoke set up by the triumphant Gauls, a dishonour that called for both public as well as private vengeance. Caesar is the only narrative source for this episode, as the corresponding books of Livy&#x27;s histories are preserved only in the &quot;Periochae&quot;, short summarising lists of contents, in which hostages given by the Romans, but no yoke, are mentioned.

In 105 BC, the allies defeated another Roman army near Arausio and went on to harry Spain, Gaul, Noricum, and northern Italy. They split up in two groups in 103 BC, with the Teutones and Ambrones marching on a western route through the &quot;Provincia&quot; and the Cimbri and Tigurini crossing the eastern Alps (probably by the Brenner Pass). While the Teutones and Ambrones were slaughtered in 102 BC by Gaius Marius near Aquae Sextiae, the Cimbri and the Tigurini wintered in the Padan plain. The following year, Marius virtually destroyed the Cimbri in the battle of Vercellae. The Tigurini, who had planned on following the Cimbri, turned back over the Alps with their booty and joined those of the Helvetians who had not participated in the raids.

=== Caesar and the Helvetian campaign of 58 BC ===
==== Prelude ====
The Helvetii were the first Gallic tribe of the campaign to be confronted by Caesar. He narrates the events of the conflict in the opening sections of &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;. Due to the political nature of the &quot;Commentarii&quot;, Caesar&#x27;s purpose in publicizing his own achievements may have distorted the significance of events and the motives of those who participated.

The nobleman Orgetorix is presented as the instigator of a new Helvetian migration, in which the entire tribe was to leave their territory and, according to Caesar, to establish a supremacy over all of Gaul. This exodus was planned over three years, in the course of which Orgetorix conspired with two noblemen from neighbouring tribes, Casticus of the Sequani and Dumnorix of the Aedui, that each should accomplish a coup d&#x27;état in his own country, after which the three new kings would collaborate. When word of his aspirations to make himself king reached the Helvetii, Orgetorix was summoned to stand trial, facing execution on the pyre should he be found guilty. For the time being, he averted a verdict by arriving at the hearing set for him with ten thousand followers and bondsmen; yet before the large force mustered by the authorities could apprehend him, he died under unexplained circumstances, the Helvetii believed by his own hand.

Nevertheless, the Helvetii did not give up their planned emigration, but burned their homes in 58 BC. They were joined by a number of tribal groups from neighbouring regions: the Raurici, the Latobrigi, the Tulingi and a group of Boii, who had besieged Noreia. They abandoned their homes completely with the intention of settling among the Santones (Saintonge). The easiest route would take them through the Rhône valley, and thus through the Roman &quot;Provincia Narbonensis&quot;.

==== Battle of the Saône ====
When they reached the boundaries of the Allobroges, the northernmost tribe of the &quot;Provincia&quot;, they found that Caesar had already dismantled the bridge of Geneva to stop their advance. The Helvetians sent &quot;the most illustrious men of their state&quot; to negotiate, promising a peaceful passage through the &quot;Provincia&quot;. Caesar stalled them by asking for some time for consideration, which he used to assemble reinforcements and to fortify the southern banks of the Rhône. When the embassy returned on the agreed-upon date, he was strong enough to bluntly reject their offer. The Helvetii now chose the more difficult northern route through the Sequani territory, which traversed the Jura Mountains via a very narrow pass at the site of the modern Fort l&#x27;Écluse, but bypassed the &quot;Provincia&quot;. After ravaging the lands of the Aedui tribe, who called upon Caesar to help them, they began the crossing of the Saône, which took them several days. As only a quarter of their forces were left on the eastern banks, Caesar attacked and routed them. According to Caesar, those killed had been the Tigurini, on whom he had now taken revenge in the name of the Republic and his family.

After the battle, the Romans quickly bridged the river, thereby prompting the Helvetii to once again send an embassy, this time led by Divico, another figure whom Caesar links to the ignominious defeat of 107 BC by calling him &quot;bello Cassio dux Helvetiorum&quot; (i.e. &quot;leader of the Helvetii in the Cassian campaign&quot;). What Divico had to offer was almost a surrender, namely to have the Helvetii settle wherever Caesar wished them to, although it was combined with the threat of an open battle if Caesar should refuse. Caesar demanded hostages to be given to him and reparations to the Aedui and Allobroges. Divico responded by saying that &quot;they were accustomed to receive, not to give hostages; a fact the Roman people could testify to&quot;, this once again being an allusion to the giving of hostages by the defeated Romans at Agen.

==== Battle of Bibracte ====
In the cavalry battle that followed, the Helvetii prevailed over Caesar&#x27;s Aedui allies under Dumnorix&#x27; command, and continued their journey, while Caesar&#x27;s army was being detained by delays in his grain supplies, caused by the Aedui on the instigations of Dumnorix, who had married Orgetorix&#x27; daughter. A few days later, however, near the Aeduan &quot;oppidum&quot; Bibracte, Caesar caught up with the Helvetii and faced them in a major battle, which ended in the Helvetii&#x27;s retreat and the capture of most of their baggage by the Romans.

Leaving the largest part of their supplies behind, the Helvetii covered around 60 km in four days, eventually reaching the lands of the Lingones (the modern Langres plateau). Caesar did not pursue them until three days after the battle, while still sending messengers to the Lingones warning them not to assist the Helvetii in any way. The Helvetii then offered their immediate surrender and agreed both to providing hostages and to giving up their weapons the next day. In the course of the night, 6000 of the Verbigeni fled from the camp out of fear of being massacred once they were defenceless. Caesar sent riders after them and ordered those who were brought back to be &quot;counted as enemies&quot;, which probably meant being sold into slavery.

==== Return of the migrants ====
In order for them to defend the Rhine frontier against the Germans, he then allowed the Helvetii, Tulingi and Latobrigi to return to their territories and to rebuild their homes, instructing the Allobroges to supply them with a sufficient supply of grain. Caesar does not mention the Raurici, who seem to have built a new &quot;oppidum&quot; at Basel-Münsterhügel upon their return. The Aedui were granted their wish that the Boii who had accompanied the Helvetii would settle on their own territory as allies in the &quot;oppidum&quot; Gorgobina. The nature of Caesar&#x27;s arrangement with the Helvetii and the other tribes is not further specified by the consul himself, but in his speech &quot;Pro Balbo&quot; of 56 BC, Cicero mentions the Helvetii as one among several tribes of &quot;foederati&quot;, i.e. allied nations who were neither citizens of the Republic nor her subjects, but obliged by treaty to support the Romans with a certain number of fighting men.

==== Caesar&#x27;s report of the numbers ====
According to the victor, tablets with lists in Greek characters were found at the Helvetian camp, listing in detail all men able to bear arms with their names and giving a total number for the women, children and elderly who accompanied them. The numbers added up to a total of 263,000 Helvetii, 36,000 Tulingi, 14,000 Latobrigi, 23,000 Rauraci, and 32,000 Boii, all in all 368,000 heads, 92,000 of whom were warriors. A census of those who had returned to their homes listed 110,000 survivors, which meant that only about 30 percent of the emigrants had survived the war.

Caesar&#x27;s report has been partly confirmed by excavations near Geneva and Bibracte. However, much of his account has not yet been corroborated by archaeology, whilst his narrative must in wide parts be considered as biased and, in some points, unlikely. For a start, only one out of the fifteen Celtic &quot;oppida&quot; in the Helvetii territory so far has yielded evidence for destruction by fire. Many other sites, for example the sanctuary at Mormont, do not exhibit any signs of damage for the period in question, and Celtic life continued seemingly undisturbed for the rest of the 1st century BC up to the beginning of the Roman era, with an accent rather on an increase in prosperity than on a &quot;Helvetic twilight&quot;. With the honourable status as &quot;foederati&quot; taken into account, it is hard to believe that the Helvetii ever sustained casualties quite as heavy as those given by the Roman military leader.

In general, numbers written down by ancient military authors have to be taken as gross exaggerations. What Caesar claims to have been 368,000 people is estimated by other sources to be rather around 300,000 (Plutarch), or 200,000 (Appian); in the light of a critical analysis, even these numbers seem far too high. Furger-Gunti considers an army of more than 60,000 fighting men extremely unlikely in the view of the tactics described, and assumes the actual numbers to have been around 40,000 warriors out of a total of 160,000 emigrants. Delbrück suggests an even lower number of 100,000 people, out of which only 16,000 were fighters, which would make the Celtic force about half the size of the Roman body of c. 30,000 men. The real numbers will never be determined exactly. Caesar&#x27;s specifications can at least be doubted by looking at the size of the baggage train that an exodus of 368,000 people would have required: Even for the reduced numbers that Furger-Gunti uses for his calculations, the baggage train would have stretched for at least 40 km, perhaps even as far as 100 km.

In spite of the now much more balanced numerical weight we have to assume for the two opposing armies, the battle seems far less glorious a victory than Caesar presented it to be. The main body of the Helvetii withdrew from the battle at nightfall, abandoning, as it seemed, most of their wagons, which they had drawn up into a wagon fort; they retreated northwards in a forced night march and reached the territory of the Lingones four days after the battle. What Caesar implies to have been a desperate flight without stopping could actually have been an ordered retreat of moderate speed, covering less than 40 km a day. Caesar himself does not appear as a triumphant victor in turn, being unable to pursue the Helvetii for three days, &quot;both on account of the wounds of the soldiers and the burial of the slain&quot;. However, it is clear that Caesar&#x27;s warning to the Lingones not to supply his enemies was quite enough to make the Helvetii leaders once again offer peace. On what terms this peace was made is debatable, but as said before, the conclusion of a &quot;foedus&quot; casts some doubt on the totality of the defeat.

==== Questions of motive ====
As Caesar&#x27;s account is heavily influenced by his political agenda, it is difficult to determine the actual motive of the Helvetii movement of 58 BC. One might see the movement in the light of a Celtic retreat from areas which were later to become Germanic; it can be debated whether they ever had plans to settle in the Saintonge, as Caesar claims (Bell. Gall. 1,10.). It was certainly in the latter&#x27;s personal interest to emphasise any kind of parallel between the traumatic experience of the Cimbrian and Teutonic incursions and the alleged threat that the Helvetii were to the Roman world. The Tigurini&#x27;s part in the destruction of L. Cassius Longinus and his army was a welcome pretext to engage in an offensive war in Gaul whose proceeds permitted Caesar not only to fulfil his obligations to the numerous creditors he owed money to, but also to further strengthen his position within the late Republic. In this sense, even the character of Divico, who makes his appearance in the &quot;Commentarii&quot; half a century after his victory over L. Cassius Longinus, seems more like another hackneyed argument stressing Caesar&#x27;s justification to attack, than like an actual historical figure. That the victor of Agen was still alive in 58 BC or, if yes, that he was physically still capable of undertaking such a journey at all, seems more than doubtful.

=== The Helvetii as Roman subjects ===

The Helvetii and Rauraci most likely lost their status as &quot;foederati&quot; only six years after the battle of Bibracte, when they supported Vercingetorix in 52 BC with 8,000 and 2,000 men, respectively. Sometime between 50 and 45 BC, the Romans founded the &quot;Colonia Iulia Equestris&quot; at the site of the Helvetian settlement &quot;Noviodunum&quot; (modern Nyon), and around 44 BC the &quot;Colonia Raurica&quot; on Rauracan territory. These colonies were probably established as a means of controlling the two most important military access routes between the Helvetian territory and the rest of Gaul, blocking the passage through the Rhône valley and Sundgau.

In the course of Augustus&#x27; reign, Roman dominance became more concrete. Some of the traditional Celtic oppida were now used as legionary garrisons, such as Vindonissa or Basilea (modern Basel); others were relocated, such as the hill-fort on the Bois de Châtel, whose inhabitants founded the new &quot;capital&quot; of the civitas at nearby Aventicum. First incorporated into the Roman province of Gallia Belgica, later into the Germania Superior and finally into the Diocletian province of Maxima Sequanorum, the former territories of the Helvetii and their inhabitants were as thoroughly romanised as the rest of Gaul.

=== The rising of 68/69 AD ===
What seems to have been the last action of the Helvetii as a tribal entity happened shortly after the death of emperor Nero in 68 AD. Like the other Gallic tribes, the Helvetii were organised as a &quot;civitas&quot;; they even retained their traditional grouping into four &quot;pagi&quot; and enjoyed a certain inner autonomy, including the defence of certain strongholds by their own troops. In the civil war which followed Nero&#x27;s death, the &quot;civitas Helvetiorum&quot; supported Galba; unaware of his death, they refused to accept the authority of his rival, Vitellius. The Legio XXI Rapax, stationed in Vindonissa and favouring Vitellius, stole the pay of a Helvetian garrison, which prompted the Helvetians to intercept Vitellian messengers and detain a Roman detachment. Aulus Caecina Alienus, a former supporter of Galba who was now at the head of a Vitellian invasion of Italy, launched a massive punitive campaign, crushing the Helvetii under their commander Claudius Severus and routing the remnants of their forces at Mount Vocetius, killing and enslaving thousands. The capital Aventicum surrendered, and Julius Alpinus, head of what was now seen as a Helvetian uprising, was executed. In spite of the extensive damage and devastations the &quot;civitas&quot; had already sustained, according to Tacitus the Helvetii were saved from total annihilation owing to the pleas of one Claudius Cossus, a Helvetian envoy to Vitellius, and, as Tacitus puts it, &quot;of well-known eloquence&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Roman occupation in the aftermath of the Gallic Wars had pacified the Celtic-Germanic contact zone along the Rhine. The Suebi and Marcomanni who under Ariovistus had planned to invade Gaul were pushed back beyond the Black Forest, where they amalgamated into the future Alemanni.
The Romans allowed Germanic tribes such as the Ubii, Triboci, Nemetes and Vangiones to settle in the deserted areas left of the Rhine. On the right bank of the Upper Rhine, which according to the testimony of Tacitus (&quot;Germania&quot; 28) had formerly also been occupied by the Helvetians, both the historical and archaeological records are sparse. 
Ptolemy (2.4.11) in the 2nd century uses the term &quot;Eremus Helvetiorum&quot; (also rendered &quot;Heremus Helvetiorum&quot;) &quot;desolation of the Helvetians&quot; to refer to this area (largely corresponding to modern Baden). The term was adopted by Aegidius Tschudi in the 16th century, and remains in use in modern historiography (German: &quot;Helvetier-Einöde&quot;).
It has been proposed that the area inhabited by the Helvetians had extended beyond the Swiss plateau, far into what is now Baden-Württemberg, but had been displaced in the course of the Cimbrian War, some two generations prior to Caesar&#x27;s invasion of Gaul.

The Swiss plateau was gradually romanized during the 1st to 3rd centuries.
The principal Roman settlements were the cities of Iulia Equestris (Nyon), Aventicum (Avenches), Augusta Raurica (Augst) and Vindonissa (Windisch). Evidence has also been found of almost twenty Roman villages (&quot;vici&quot;) and hundreds of villas.

In the course of Romanization, the Celtic polytheism of the Helvetians was syncretized with Roman religion. The Celtic deities came to be worshiped under the names of their Roman counterparts, and Roman gods acquired the names of local gods, such as &quot;Mars Caturix&quot;, &quot;Mercurius Cissonius&quot; and &quot;Jupiter Poeninus&quot;.
A major cultic center of Gallo-Roman religion, consisting of eight chapels or small temples, was found in Allmendingen near Thun. Deities worshipped at the site included Mars (presumably in lieu of Caturix) and Rosmerta as well as Mithras.

Although the Gaulish language had mostly been ousted by Latin by the 3rd century, many Celtic toponyms have survived in Switzerland. Of the ten largest present-day Swiss cities, at least six have Celtic placename etymologies,
and most major Swiss rivers have either Celtic or pre-Celtic names.

The order and prosperity of the &quot;Pax Romana&quot; ended with the Crisis of the Third Century. In 260, when the Gallic Empire briefly seceded from Rome, emperor Gallienus withdrew the legions from the Rhine to fight the usurper Ingenuus, allowing the Alemanni to invade the Swiss plateau. There, cities, villages and most &quot;villae&quot; were raided or sacked by marauding bands. The numerous caches of coins recovered from the period between 250 and 280 attest to the severity of the crisis.

The Helvetii were re-discovered as the forebears of the Swiss in the early historiography of Switzerland, in the late 15th to early 16th century. Their name was adopted as the Latin equivalent of the designation &quot;Switzer&quot;, and the Swiss Confederacy was given the Latin name of &quot;Republica Helvetiorum&quot;. The name of the national personification of Switzerland, &quot;Helvetia&quot;, and the country&#x27;s contemporary Neo-Latin name, &quot;Confoederatio Helvetica&quot; (abbreviated CH), are derived from this tradition.

In 2015, the star 51 Pegasi, the first main-sequence star found to have an exoplanet, was named Helvetios after the Helvetii as part of the IAU&#x27;s NameExoWorlds contest.

== Celtic oppida in Switzerland ==

The distribution of La Tène culture burials in Switzerland indicates that the Swiss plateau between Lausanne and Winterthur was relatively densely populated. Settlement centres existed in the Aare valley between Thun and Bern, and between Lake Zurich and the river Reuss. The Valais and the regions around Bellinzona and Lugano also seem to have been well-populated; however, those lay outside the Helvetian borders.

Almost all the Helvetic &quot;oppida&quot; were built in the vicinity of the larger rivers of the Swiss midlands. Not all of them existed at the same time. For most of them, we do not have any idea as to what their Gaulish names might have been, with one or two possible exceptions. 
Where a pre-Roman name is preserved, it is added in brackets. Those marked with an asterisk (*) were most likely occupied by neighbouring tribes (Raurici, Veragri, etc.) rather than the Helvetii.

<text>Heretics of Dune is a 1984 science fiction novel by Frank Herbert, the fifth in his &quot;Dune&quot; series of six novels. 

Set 1,500 years after the events of &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; (1981), the novel finds humanity on the path set for them by the tyrant Leto II Atreides to guarantee their survival. But a new threat arrives in the form of the Honored Matres, a brutal matriarchy from beyond the known universe whose only goals are conquest and destruction.

&quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; was ranked as the No. 13 hardcover fiction best seller of 1984 by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Fifteen hundred years after the 3,500-year reign of the God Emperor Leto II Atreides ended with his assassination, humanity is firmly on the Golden Path, Leto&#x27;s plan to save humanity from destruction. By crushing the aspirations of humans for over three thousand years and dismantling the complex economic system dependent on the spice melange, Leto caused the Scattering, an explosion of humanity into the rest of the universe upon his death. 

Sandworms have reappeared on Arrakis (now called Rakis), and have renewed the flow of the all-important spice to the galaxy. A new civilization has risen, with three dominant powers: the Ixians, whose no-ships are capable of piloting between the stars and are invisible to outside detection; the Bene Tleilax, who have learned to manufacture spice in their axlotl tanks and have created a new breed of Face Dancers; and the Bene Gesserit, a matriarchal order of subtle political manipulators who possess superhuman abilities. However, people from the Scattering are returning with their own peculiar powers. The most powerful of these forces are the Honored Matres, a violent society of women bred and trained for combat and the sexual control of men.

The Bene Gesserit leader, Mother Superior Taraza, brings Mentat and former Supreme Bashar Miles Teg out of retirement to oversee the protection of their latest Tleilaxu-provided Duncan Idaho ghola on the planet Gammu. She also sends Bene Gesserit Imprinter Lucilla to instruct Duncan, and eventually bind his loyalty to the Sisterhood with her sexual talents. At the same time, Teg&#x27;s biological daughter, Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade, is put in command of the Bene Gesserit keep on Rakis. The Bene Gesserit discover Sheeana, a girl who can control the giant sandworms, and hope to gain control of her and the religion that will inevitably form around her. Soon the Bene Gesserit thwart an attack on Sheeana, and Odrade begins training her in the ways of the Sisterhood.

When an assassination attempt is made on Duncan, Lucilla and Teg flee with him into the countryside. Teg awakens Duncan&#x27;s original memories, but does so before Lucilla can imprint Duncan and thus tie him to the Sisterhood. Teg is captured by the Honored Matres while Lucilla and Duncan escape. Teg is tortured by a T-Probe, but under pressure discovers new abilities: drastically increased physical capabilities and an uncertain type of prescience, which he uses to easily escape. Duncan is subdued by a young Honored Matre named Murbella, who attempts to enslave him sexually. However, hidden Tleilaxu conditioning kicks in, and Duncan responds with an equal technique that overwhelms Murbella. The experience restores in him the entire memories of all of the hundreds of previous Duncan gholas.

Taraza meets with the Tleilaxu Master Waff and compels him to tell her what he knows about the Honored Matres. He also reveals that the Bene Tleilax have conditioned their own agenda into Duncan. Taraza gleans the Tleilaxu&#x27;s secret religious beliefs from their conversation, and uses them to manipulate an alliance with the Bene Tleilax that better serves the Bene Gesserit. Odrade realizes that Taraza&#x27;s plan is to destroy Rakis just as the Honored Matres invade, killing Taraza. Odrade becomes temporary leader of the Bene Gesserit and escapes with Sheeana into the desert on a worm. 

Teg finds that his prescient powers allow him to &quot;see&quot; shielded no-ships, enabling him to locate Duncan and Lucilla. They flee to Rakis with a captive Murbella, intercepting Odrade and Sheeana and their giant worm. Teg leads his troops in a suicidal defense of Rakis designed to enrage the Honored Matres and goad them into using their planet-destroying Obliterators. They do so, incinerating Rakis and killing all sandworms, save the one with which Odrade and Sheeana have escaped. They intend to use it to create a new sandworm ecosystem on the secret Bene Gesserit planet Chapterhouse.

== Publication history ==
Frank Herbert wrote much of the initial draft of &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; in Hawaii, using a Compaq word processor. According to his son Brian, Herbert&#x27;s time spent writing the draft would be &quot;exceedingly arduous and much slower for him [Herbert] than usual, because of all the time he had to spend out of his study tending to the medical crises of my mother, Beverly Herbert.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described this fifth installment of the &quot;Dune&quot; series as &quot;another uneven entry, slow to start and hastily, rather abruptly concluded—but more exciting and adventurous than any since the original &quot;Dune&quot;, with a gratifying influx of new ideas.&quot;

&quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; was ranked as the No. 13 hardcover fiction best seller of 1984 by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

<text>Halakha ( ; , ), also transliterated as halacha, halakhah, and halocho ( ), is the collective body of Jewish religious laws that are derived from the Written and Oral Torah. Halakha is based on biblical commandments (&quot;mitzvot&quot;), subsequent Talmudic and rabbinic laws, and the customs and traditions which were compiled in the many books such as the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; or &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;. &quot;Halakha&quot; is often translated as &quot;Jewish law&quot;, although a more literal translation might be &quot;the way to behave&quot; or &quot;the way of walking&quot;. The word is derived from the root which means &quot;to behave&quot; (also &quot;to go&quot; or &quot;to walk&quot;). &quot;Halakha&quot; not only guides religious practices and beliefs; it also guides numerous aspects of day-to-day life.

Historically, widespread observance of the laws of the Torah is first in evidence beginning in the second century BCE. In the Jewish diaspora, &quot;halakha&quot; served many Jewish communities as an enforceable avenue of law – both civil and religious, since no differentiation of them exists in classical Judaism. Since the Jewish Enlightenment (&quot;Haskalah&quot;) and Jewish emancipation, some have come to view the &quot;halakha&quot; as less binding in day-to-day life, because it relies on rabbinic interpretation, as opposed to the authoritative, canonical text which is recorded in the Hebrew Bible. Under contemporary Israeli law, certain areas of Israeli family and personal status law are, for Jews, under the authority of the rabbinic courts, so they are treated according to &quot;halakha&quot;. Some minor differences in &quot;halakha&quot; are found among Ashkenazi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, Sephardi Jews, Yemenite, Ethiopian and other Jewish communities which historically lived in isolation.

== Etymology and terminology ==

The word &quot;halakha&quot; is derived from the Hebrew root &quot;halakh&quot; – &quot;to walk&quot; or &quot;to go&quot;. Taken literally, therefore, &quot;halakha&quot; translates as &quot;the way to walk&quot;, rather than &quot;law&quot;. The word &quot;halakha&quot; refers to the corpus of rabbinic legal texts, or to the overall system of religious law. The term may also be related to Akkadian , a property tax, rendered in Aramaic as , designating one or several obligations. It may be descended from hypothetical reconstructed Proto-Semitic root meaning &quot;to go&quot;, which also has descendants in Akkadian, Arabic, Aramaic, and Ugaritic.

&quot;Halakha&quot; is often contrasted with &quot;aggadah&quot; (&quot;the telling&quot;), the diverse corpus of rabbinic exegetical, narrative, philosophical, mystical, and other &quot;non-legal&quot; texts. At the same time, since writers of &quot;halakha&quot; may draw upon the aggadic and even mystical literature, a dynamic interchange occurs between the genres. &quot;Halakha&quot; also does not include the parts of the Torah not related to commandments.

&quot;Halakha&quot; constitutes the practical application of the 613 &quot;mitzvot&quot; (&quot;commandments&quot;) in the Torah, as developed through discussion and debate in the classical rabbinic literature, especially the Mishnah and the Talmud (the &quot;Oral Torah&quot;), and as codified in the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; and &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;. Because &quot;halakha&quot; is developed and applied by various halakhic authorities rather than one sole &quot;official voice&quot;, different individuals and communities may well have different answers to halakhic questions. With few exceptions, controversies are not settled through authoritative structures because during the Jewish diaspora, Jews lacked a single judicial hierarchy or appellate review process for &quot;halakha&quot;.

According to some scholars, the words &quot;halakha&quot; and sharia both mean literally &quot;the path to follow&quot;. The fiqh literature parallels rabbinical law developed in the Talmud, with fatwas being analogous to rabbinic &quot;responsa&quot;.

== Commandments (mitzvot) ==

According to the Talmud (&quot;Tractate Makot&quot;), 613 &quot;mitzvot&quot; are in the Torah, 248 positive (&quot;thou shalt&quot;) &quot;mitzvot&quot; and 365 negative (&quot;thou shalt not&quot;) &quot;mitzvot&quot;, supplemented by seven &quot;mitzvot&quot; legislated by the rabbis of antiquity. Currently, many of the 613 commandments cannot be performed until the building of the Temple in Jerusalem and the universal resettlement of the Jewish people in the Land of Israel by the Messiah. According to one count, only 369 can be kept, meaning that 40% of mitzvot are not possible to perform.

Rabbinic Judaism divides laws into categories:

* The Law of Moses which are believed to have been revealed by God to the Israelites at biblical Mount Sinai. These laws are composed of the following:
** The Written Torah, laws written in the Hebrew Bible.
** The Oral Torah, laws believed to have been transmitted orally prior to their later compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic codes.
* Laws of human origin, including rabbinic decrees, interpretations, customs, etc.

This division between revealed and rabbinic commandments may influence the importance of a rule, its enforcement and the nature of its ongoing interpretation. Halakhic authorities may disagree on which laws fall into which categories or the circumstances (if any) under which prior rabbinic rulings can be re-examined by contemporary rabbis, but all Halakhic Jews hold that both categories exist and that the first category is immutable, with exceptions only for life-saving and similar emergency circumstances.

A second classical distinction is between the Written Law, laws written in the Hebrew Bible, and the Oral Law, laws which are believed to have been transmitted orally prior to their later compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic codes.

Commandments are divided into positive and negative commands, which are treated differently in terms of divine and human punishment. Positive commandments &quot;require&quot; an action to be performed and are considered to bring the performer closer to God. Negative commandments (traditionally 365 in number) &quot;forbid&quot; a specific action, and violations create a distance from God.

A further division is made between &quot;chukim&quot; (&quot;decrees&quot; – laws without obvious explanation, such as &quot;shatnez&quot;, the law prohibiting wearing clothing made of mixtures of linen and wool), &quot;mishpatim&quot; (&quot;judgements&quot; – laws with obvious social implications) and &quot;eduyot&quot; (&quot;testimonies&quot; or &quot;commemorations&quot;, such as the Shabbat and holidays). Through the ages, various rabbinical authorities have classified some of the 613 commandments in many ways.

A different approach divides the laws into a different set of categories:
* Laws in relation to God (&quot;bein adam laMakom&quot;, &quot;between a person and the Place&quot;), and
* Laws about relations with other people (&quot;bein adam le-chavero&quot;, &quot;between a person and his friend&quot;).

== Sources and process ==

Eras of Jewish law
* Chazal ( &quot;Our Sages, may their memory be blessed&quot;): all Jewish sages of the Mishna, Tosefta and Talmud eras ().
** The &quot;Zugot&quot; (&quot;pairs&quot;), both the 200-year period ( – 30 CE, &quot;Era of the Pairs&quot;) during the Second Temple period in which the spiritual leadership was in the hands of five successions of &quot;pairs&quot; of religious teachers, and to each of these pairs themselves.
** The &quot;Tannaim&quot; (&quot;repeaters&quot;) were rabbis living primarily in Eretz Yisrael who codified the Oral Torah in the form of the Mishnah; 0–200 CE.
** The &quot;Amoraim&quot; (&quot;sayers&quot;) lived in both Eretz Yisrael and Babylonia. Their teachings and discussions were compiled into the two versions of the Gemara; 200–500.
** The &quot;Savoraim&quot; (&quot;reasoners&quot;) lived primarily in Sassanid Babylonia due to the suppression of Judaism in the Eastern Roman Empire under Theodosius II; 500–650.
* The &quot;Geonim&quot; (&quot;greats&quot; or &quot;geniuses&quot;) presided over the two major Babylonian Academies of Sura and Pumbedita; 650–1038.
* The &quot;Rishonim&quot; (&quot;firsts&quot;) are the rabbis of the late medieval period (–1563), preceding the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;.
* The &quot;Acharonim&quot; (&quot;lasts&quot;) are the rabbis from to the present.
The development of &quot;halakha&quot; in the period before the Maccabees, which has been described as the formative period in the history of its development, is shrouded in obscurity. Historian Yitzhak Baer argued that there was little pure academic legal activity at this period and that many of the laws originating at this time were produced by a means of neighbourly good conduct rules in a similar way as carried out by Greeks in the age of Solon. For example, the first chapter of &quot;Bava Kamma&quot;, contains a formulation of the law of torts worded in the first person.

The boundaries of Jewish law are determined through the Halakhic process, a religious-ethical system of legal reasoning. Rabbis generally base their opinions on the primary sources of &quot;halakha&quot; as well as on precedent set by previous rabbinic opinions. The major sources and genre of &quot;halakha&quot; consulted include:
* The foundational Talmudic literature (especially the Mishna and the Babylonian Talmud) with commentaries;
** Talmudic hermeneutics: the science which defines the rules and methods for the investigation and exact determination of the meaning of the Scriptures; also includes the rules from which the Halakhot are derived and which were established by the written law. These may be seen as the rules from which early Jewish law is derived.
** &quot;Gemara&quot; – the Talmudic process of elucidating the &quot;halakha&quot;
* The post-Talmudic codificatory literature, such as Maimonides&#x27;s Mishneh Torah and the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; with its commentaries (see #Codes of Jewish law below);
* Regulations and other &quot;legislative&quot; enactments promulgated by rabbis and communal bodies:
** &quot;Gezeirah&quot; (&quot;declaration&quot;): &quot;preventative legislation&quot; of the rabbis, intended to prevent violations of the commandments
** &quot;Takkanah&quot; (&quot;repair&quot; or &quot;regulation&quot;): &quot;positive legislation&quot;, practices instituted by the rabbis not based (directly) on the commandments
* &quot;Minhag&quot;: Customs, community practices, and customary law, as well as the exemplary deeds of prominent (or local) rabbis;
* The &quot;she&#x27;eloth u-teshuvoth&quot; (responsa, &quot;questions and answers&quot;) literature.
* &quot;Dina d&#x27;malchuta dina&quot; (&quot;the law of the king is law&quot;): an additional aspect of &quot;halakha&quot;, being the principle recognizing non-Jewish laws and non-Jewish legal jurisdiction as binding on Jewish citizens, provided that they are not contrary to a law in Judaism. This principle applies primarily in areas of commercial, civil and criminal law.

In antiquity, the &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; functioned essentially as the Supreme Court and legislature (in the US judicial system) for Judaism, and had the power to administer binding law, including both received law and its own rabbinic decrees, on all Jews—rulings of the Sanhedrin became &quot;halakha&quot;; see Oral law. That court ceased to function in its full mode in 40 CE. Today, the authoritative application of Jewish law is left to the local rabbi, and the local rabbinical courts, with only local applicability. In branches of Judaism that follow &quot;halakha&quot;, lay individuals make numerous ad-hoc decisions but are regarded as not having authority to decide certain issues definitively.

Since the days of the Sanhedrin, however, no body or authority has been generally regarded as having the authority to create universally recognized precedents. As a result, &quot;halakha&quot; has developed in a somewhat different fashion from Anglo-American legal systems with a Supreme Court able to provide universally accepted precedents. Generally, Halakhic arguments are effectively, yet unofficially, peer-reviewed. When a rabbinic &quot;posek&quot; (&quot;he who makes a statement&quot;, &quot;decisor&quot;) proposes an additional interpretation of a law, that interpretation may be considered binding for the posek&#x27;s questioner or immediate community. Depending on the stature of the posek and the quality of the decision, an interpretation may also be gradually accepted by other rabbis and members of other Jewish communities.

Under this system there is a tension between the relevance of earlier and later authorities in constraining Halakhic interpretation and innovation. On the one hand, there is a principle in &quot;halakha&quot; not to overrule a specific law from an earlier era, after it is accepted by the community as a law or vow, unless supported by another, relevant earlier precedent; see list below. On the other hand, another principle recognizes the responsibility and authority of later authorities, and especially the &quot;posek&quot; handling a then-current question. In addition, the &quot;halakha&quot; embodies a wide range of principles that permit judicial discretion and deviation (Ben-Menahem).

Notwithstanding the potential for innovation, rabbis and Jewish communities differ greatly on how they make changes in &quot;halakha&quot;. Notably, &quot;poskim&quot; frequently extend the application of a law to new situations, but do not consider such applications as constituting a &quot;change&quot; in &quot;halakha&quot;. For example, many Orthodox rulings concerning electricity are derived from rulings concerning fire, as closing an electrical circuit may cause a spark. In contrast, Conservative &quot;poskim&quot; consider that switching on electrical equipment is physically and chemically more like turning on a water tap (which is permissible by &quot;halakha&quot;) than lighting a fire (which is not permissible), and therefore permitted on Shabbat. The reformative Judaism in some cases explicitly interprets &quot;halakha&quot; to take into account its view of contemporary society. For instance, most Conservative rabbis extend the application of certain Jewish obligations and permissible activities to women (see below).

Within certain Jewish communities, formal organized bodies do exist. Within Modern Orthodox Judaism, there is no one committee or leader, but Modern US-based Orthodox rabbis generally agree with the views set by consensus by the leaders of the Rabbinical Council of America. Within Conservative Judaism, the Rabbinical Assembly has an official Committee on Jewish Law and Standards.

Note that &quot;takkanot&quot; (plural of &quot;takkanah&quot;) in general do not affect or restrict observance of Torah &quot;mitzvot&quot;. (Sometimes &quot;takkanah&quot; refers to either &quot;gezeirot&quot; or &quot;takkanot&quot;.) However, the Talmud states that in exceptional cases, the Sages had the authority to &quot;uproot matters from the Torah&quot;. In Talmudic and classical Halakhic literature, this authority refers to the authority to prohibit some things that would otherwise be Biblically sanctioned (&quot;shev v&#x27;al ta&#x27;aseh&quot;, &quot;thou shall stay seated and not do&quot;). Rabbis may rule that a specific mitzvah from the Torah should not be performed, e. g., blowing the &quot;shofar&quot; on Shabbat, or taking the &quot;lulav and etrog&quot; on Shabbat. These examples of takkanot which may be executed out of caution lest some might otherwise carry the mentioned items between home and the synagogue, thus inadvertently violating a Sabbath &quot;melakha&quot;. Another rare and limited form of takkanah involved overriding Torah prohibitions. In some cases, the Sages allowed the temporary violation of a prohibition in order to maintain the Jewish system as a whole. This was part of the basis for Esther&#x27;s relationship with Ahasuerus (Xeres). For general usage of takkanaot in Jewish history see the article Takkanah. For examples of this being used in Conservative Judaism, see Conservative halakha.

=== Historical analysis ===

The antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them; in general, they cannot safely be declared older than the tanna (&quot;repeater&quot;) to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot (&quot;measurements&quot;, and referring to [good] behavior) of Hillel and the thirteen of Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, who was the first to transmit them.

The Talmud gives no information concerning the origin of the middot, although the Geonim (&quot;Sages&quot;) regarded them as Sinaitic (Law given to Moses at Sinai).

The middot seem to have been first laid down as abstract rules by the teachers of Hillel, though they were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding. Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricted or expanded them, in various ways. Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael and their scholars especially contributed to the development or establishment of these rules. &quot;It must be borne in mind, however, that neither Hillel, Ishmael, nor [a contemporary of theirs named] Eliezer ben Jose sought to give a complete enumeration of the rules of interpretation current in his day, but that they omitted from their collections many rules which were then followed.&quot;

Akiva devoted his attention particularly to the grammatical and exegetical rules, while Ishmael developed the logical. The rules laid down by one school were frequently rejected by another because the principles that guided them in their respective formulations were essentially different. According to Akiva, the divine language of the Torah is distinguished from the speech of men by the fact that in the former no word or sound is superfluous.

Some scholars have observed a similarity between these rabbinic rules of interpretation and the hermeneutics of ancient Hellenistic culture. For example, Saul Lieberman argues that the names of rabbi Ishmael&#x27;s &quot;middot&quot; (e. g., &quot;kal vahomer&quot;, a combination of the archaic form of the word for &quot;straw&quot; and the word for &quot;clay&quot; – &quot;straw and clay&quot;, referring to the obvious [means of making a mud brick]) are Hebrew translations of Greek terms, although the methods of those &quot;middot&quot; are not Greek in origin.

== Views today ==
Orthodox Judaism holds that &quot;halakha&quot; is the divine law as laid out in the Torah (five books of Moses), rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees, and customs combined. The rabbis, who made many additions and interpretations of Jewish Law, did so only in accordance with regulations they believe were given for this purpose to Moses on Mount Sinai, see . See Orthodox Judaism, Beliefs about Jewish law and tradition.

Conservative Judaism holds that &quot;halakha&quot; is normative and binding, and is developed as a partnership between people and God based on Sinaitic Torah. While there are a wide variety of Conservative views, a common belief is that &quot;halakha&quot; is, and has always been, an evolving process subject to interpretation by rabbis in every time period. See Conservative Judaism, Beliefs.

Reconstructionist Judaism holds that halakha is normative and binding, while also believing that it is an evolving concept and that the traditional halakhic system is incapable of producing a code of conduct that is meaningful for, and acceptable to, the vast majority of contemporary Jews. Reconstructionist founder Mordecai Kaplan believed that &quot;Jewish life [is] meaningless without Jewish law.&quot;, and one of the planks of the Society for the Jewish Renascence, of which Kaplan was one of the founders, stated: &quot;We accept the halakha, which is rooted in the Talmud, as the norm of Jewish life, availing ourselves, at the same time, of the method implicit therein to interpret and develop the body of Jewish Law in accordance with the actual conditions and spiritual needs of modern life.&quot;

Reform Judaism holds that modern views of how the Torah and rabbinic law developed imply that the body of rabbinic Jewish law is no longer normative (seen as binding) on Jews today. Those in the &quot;traditionalist&quot; wing believe that the &quot;halakha&quot; represents a personal starting-point, holding that each Jew is obligated to interpret the Torah, Talmud and other Jewish works for themselves, and this interpretation will create separate commandments for each person. Those in the liberal and classical wings of Reform believe that in this day and era, most Jewish religious rituals are no longer necessary, and many hold that following most Jewish laws is actually counter-productive. They propose that Judaism has entered a phase of ethical monotheism, and that the laws of Judaism are only remnants of an earlier stage of religious evolution, and need not be followed. This is considered wrong, and even heretical, by Orthodox and Conservative Judaism.

Humanistic Jews value the Torah as a historical, political, and sociological text written by their ancestors. They do not believe &quot;that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct, just because the Torah is old&quot;. The Torah is both disagreed with and questioned. Humanistic Jews believe that the entire Jewish experience, and not only the Torah, should be studied as a source for Jewish behavior and ethical values.

Some Jews believe that gentiles are bound by a subset of &quot;halakha&quot; called the Seven Laws of Noah, also referred to as the Noahide Laws. They are a set of imperatives which, according to the Talmud, were given by God to the &quot;children of Noah&quot; – that is, all of humanity.

=== Flexibility ===
Despite its internal rigidity, &quot;halakha&quot; has a degree of flexibility in finding solutions to modern problems that are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah. From the very beginnings of Rabbinic Judaism, halakhic inquiry allowed for a &quot;sense of continuity between past and present, a self-evident trust that their pattern of life and belief now conformed to the sacred patterns and beliefs presented by scripture and tradition&quot;. According to an analysis by Jewish scholar Jeffrey Rubenstein of Michael Berger&#x27;s book &quot;Rabbinic Authority&quot;, the authority that rabbis hold &quot;derives not from the institutional or personal authority of the sages but from a &quot;communal&quot; decision to recognize that authority, much as a community recognizes a certain judicial system to resolve its disputes and interpret its laws.&quot; Given this covenantal relationship, rabbis are charged with connecting their contemporary community with the traditions and precedents of the past.

When presented with contemporary issues, rabbis go through a halakhic process to find an answer. The classical approach has permitted new rulings regarding modern technology. For example, some of these rulings guide Jewish observers about the proper use of electricity on the Sabbath and holidays. Often, as to the applicability of the law in any given situation, the proviso is to &quot;consult your local rabbi or posek&quot;. This notion lends rabbis a certain degree of local authority; however, for more complex questions the issue is passed on to higher rabbis who will then issue a &quot;teshuva&quot;, which is a &quot;responsa&quot; that is binding. Indeed, rabbis will continuously issue different opinions and will constantly review each other&#x27;s work so as to maintain the truest sense of &quot;halakha&quot;. Overall, this process allows rabbis to maintain connection of traditional Jewish law to modern life. Of course, the degree of flexibility depends on the sect of Judaism, with Reform being the most flexible, Conservative somewhat in the middle, and Orthodox being much more stringent and rigid. Modern critics, however, have charged that with the rise of movements that challenge the &quot;divine&quot; authority of &quot;halakha&quot;, traditional Jews have greater reluctance to change, not only the laws themselves but also other customs and habits, than traditional Rabbinical Judaism did prior to the advent of Reform in the 19th century.

=== Denominational approaches ===
==== Orthodox Judaism ====
Orthodox Jews believe that &quot;halakha&quot; is a religious system whose core represents the revealed will of God. Although Orthodox Judaism acknowledges that rabbis have made many decisions and decrees regarding Jewish Law where the written Torah itself is nonspecific, they did so only in accordance with regulations received by Moses on Mount Sinai (see ). These regulations were transmitted orally until shortly after the destruction of the Second Temple. They were then recorded in the Mishnah, and explained in the Talmud and commentaries throughout history up until the present day. Orthodox Judaism believes that subsequent interpretations have been derived with the utmost accuracy and care. The most widely accepted codes of Jewish law are known as Mishneh Torah and the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;.

Orthodox Judaism has a range of opinions on the circumstances and extent to which change is permissible. Haredi Jews generally hold that even &quot;minhagim&quot; (customs) must be retained, and existing precedents cannot be reconsidered. Modern Orthodox authorities are more inclined to permit limited changes in customs and some reconsideration of precedent.

Despite the Orthodox views that &quot;halakha&quot; was given at Sinai, Orthodox thought (and especially modern Orthodox thought) encourages debate, allows for disagreement, and encourages rabbis to enact decisions based on contemporary needs. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein says in his introduction to his collection of responsa that a rabbi who studies the texts carefully is required to provide a halakhic decision. That decision is considered to be a true teaching, even if it is not the true teaching in according to the heavens. For instance, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik believes that the job of a halakhic is to apply &quot;halakha&quot; − which exists in an ideal realm−to people&#x27;s lived experiences. Moshe Shmuel Glasner, the chief rabbi of Cluj (&quot;Klausenberg&quot; in German or &quot;קלויזנבורג&quot; in Yiddish) stated that the Oral Torah was an oral tradition by design, to allow for the creative application of halakha to each time period, and even enabling halakha to evolve. He writes:

==== Conservative Judaism ====
The view held by Conservative Judaism is that the Torah is not the word of God in a literal sense. However, the Torah is still held as mankind&#x27;s record of its understanding of God&#x27;s revelation, and thus still has divine authority. Therefore, &quot;halakha&quot; is still seen as binding. Conservative Jews use modern methods of historical study to learn how Jewish law has changed over time, and are, in some cases, willing to change Jewish law in the present.

A key practical difference between Conservative and Orthodox approaches is that Conservative Judaism holds that its rabbinical body&#x27;s powers are not limited to reconsidering later precedents based on earlier sources, but the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS) is empowered to override Biblical and Taanitic prohibitions by &quot;takkanah&quot; (decree) when perceived to be inconsistent with modern requirements or views of ethics. The CJLS has used this power on a number of occasions, most famously in the &quot;driving teshuva&quot;, which says that if someone is unable to walk to any synagogue on the Sabbath, and their commitment to observance is so loose that not attending synagogue may lead them to drop it altogether, their rabbi may give them a dispensation to drive there and back; and more recently in its decision prohibiting the taking of evidence on &quot;mamzer&quot; status on the grounds that implementing such a status is immoral. The CJLS has also held that the Talmudic concept of &quot;Kavod HaBriyot&quot; permits lifting rabbinic decrees (as distinct from carving narrow exceptions) on grounds of human dignity, and used this principle in a December 2006 opinion lifting all rabbinic prohibitions on homosexual conduct (the opinion held that only male-male anal sex was forbidden by the Bible and that this remained prohibited). Conservative Judaism also made a number of changes to the role of women in Judaism including counting women in a minyan, permitting women to chant from the Torah, and ordaining women as rabbis.

The Conservative approach to halakhic interpretation can be seen in the CJLS&#x27;s acceptance of Rabbi Elie Kaplan Spitz&#x27;s responsum decreeing the biblical category of &quot;mamzer&quot; as &quot;inoperative.&quot; The CJLS adopted the responsum&#x27;s view that the &quot;morality which we learn through the larger, unfolding narrative of our tradition&quot; informs the application of Mosaic law. The responsum cited several examples of how the rabbinic sages declined to enforce punishments explicitly mandated by Torah law. The examples include the trial of the accused adulteress (&quot;sotah&quot;), the &quot;law of breaking the neck of the heifer,&quot; and the application of the death penalty for the &quot;rebellious child.&quot; Kaplan Spitz argues that the punishment of the &quot;mamzer&quot; has been effectively inoperative for nearly two thousand years due to deliberate rabbinic inaction. Further he suggested that the rabbis have long regarded the punishment declared by the Torah as immoral, and came to the conclusion that no court should agree to hear testimony on &quot;mamzerut&quot;.

== Codes of Jewish law ==
The most important codifications of Jewish law include the following; for complementary discussion, see also History of responsa in Judaism.
* The Mishnah, composed by Judah haNasi, in 200 CE, as a basic outline of the state of the Oral Law in his time. This was the framework upon which the Talmud was based; the Talmud&#x27;s dialectic analysis of the content of the Mishna (&quot;gemara&quot;; completed c. 500) became the basis for all later halakhic decisions and subsequent codes.
* Codifications by the Geonim of the halakhic material in the Talmud.
** An early work, &quot;She&#x27;iltot&quot; (&quot;Questions&quot;) by Ahai of Shabha (c. 752) discusses over 190 &quot;mitzvot&quot; – exploring and addressing various questions on these. The &quot;She&#x27;iltot&quot; was influential on both of the following, subsequent works.
** The first legal codex proper, &quot;Halachot Pesukot&quot; (&quot;Decided Laws&quot;), by Yehudai ben Nahman (c. 760), rearranges the Talmud passages in a structure manageable to the layman. (It was written in vernacular Aramaic, and subsequently translated into Hebrew as &quot;Hilkhot Riu&quot;.)
** &quot;Halakhot Gedolot&quot; (&quot;Great Law Book&quot;), by Simeon Kayyara, published two generations later (but possibly written c. 743 CE), contains extensive additional material, mainly from Responsa and Monographs of the Geonim, and is presented in a form that is closer to the original Talmud language and structure. (Probably since it was distributed, also, amongst the newly established Ashkenazi communities.) 
* The Hilchot HaRif was written by the Rabbi Isaac Alfasi (1013–1103); it has summations of the legal material found in the Talmud. Alfasi transcribed the Talmud&#x27;s halakhic conclusions verbatim, without the surrounding deliberation; he also excluded all aggadic (non-legal, and homiletic) matter. The &quot;Hilchot&quot; soon superseded the geonic codes, as it contained all the decisions and the laws then relevant, and additionally, served as an accessible Talmudic commentary; it has been printed with almost every subsequent edition of the Talmud.
* The Mishneh Torah by Maimonides (1135–1204). This work encompasses the full range of Talmudic law; it is organized and reformulated in a logical system – in 14 books, 83 sections and 1000 chapters – with each &quot;halakha&quot; stated clearly. The Mishneh Torah is very influential to this day, and several later works reproduce passages verbatim. It also includes a section on Metaphysics and fundamental beliefs. (Some claim this section draws heavily on Aristotelian science and metaphysics; others suggest that it is within the tradition of Saadia Gaon.) It is the main source of practical &quot;halakha&quot; for many Yemenite Jews – mainly Baladi and Dor Daim – as well as for a growing community referred to as &quot;talmidei haRambam&quot;.
* The work of &quot;the Rosh&quot;, Rabbi Asher ben Jehiel (1250?/1259?–1328), an abstract of the Talmud, concisely stating the final halakhic decision and quoting later authorities, notably Alfasi, Maimonides, and the Tosafists. This work superseded Rabbi Alfasi&#x27;s and has been printed with almost every subsequent edition of the Talmud.
* The &quot;Sefer Mitzvot Gadol&quot; (The &quot;SeMaG&quot;) of Rabbi Moses ben Jacob of Coucy (first half of the 13th century, Coucy, northern France). &quot;SeMaG&quot; is organised around the 365 negative and the 248 positive commandments, separately discussing each of them according to the Talmud (in light of the commentaries of Rashi and the Tosafot) and the other codes existent at the time. &quot;Sefer Mitzvot Katan&quot; (&quot;SeMaK&quot;) by Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil is an abridgement of the &quot;SeMaG&quot;, including additional practical &quot;halakha&quot;, as well as aggadic and ethical material.
* &quot;The Mordechai&quot; – by Mordecai ben Hillel (d. Nuremberg 1298) – serves both as a source of analysis, as well as of decided law. Mordechai considered about 350 halakhic authorities, and was widely influential, particularly amongst the Ashkenazi and Italian communities. Although organised around the &quot;Hilchot&quot; of &quot;the Rif&quot; (Rabbi Isaac Alfasi), it is, in fact, an independent work. It has been printed with every edition of the Talmud since 1482.

* The Arba&#x27;ah Turim (lit. &quot;The Four Columns&quot;; the &quot;Tur&quot;) by Rabbi Jacob ben Asher (1270–1343, Toledo, Spain). This work traces the &quot;halakha&quot; from the Torah text and the Talmud through the Rishonim, with the &quot;Hilchot&quot; of Alfasi as its starting point. Ben Asher followed Maimonides&#x27;s precedent in arranging his work in a topical order, however, the &quot;Tur&quot; covers only those areas of Jewish law that were in force in the author&#x27;s time. The code is divided into four main sections; almost all codes since this time have followed the &quot;Tur&quot;&#x27;s arrangement of material.
** Orach Chayim (&quot;The Way of Life&quot;): worship and ritual observance in the home and synagogue, through the course of the day, the weekly sabbath and the festival cycle.
** Yoreh De&#x27;ah (&quot;Teach Knowledge&quot;): assorted ritual instructions and prohibitions, dietary laws and regulations concerning menstrual impurity.
** Even Ha&#x27;ezer (&quot;The Rock of the Helpmate&quot;): marriage, divorce and other issues in family law.
** Choshen Mishpat (&quot;The Breastplate of Judgement&quot;): The administration and adjudication of civil law.
* The &quot;Beit Yosef&quot; and the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; of Rabbi Yosef Karo (1488–1575). The &quot;Beit Yosef&quot; is a huge commentary on the &quot;Tur&quot; in which Rabbi Karo traces the development of each law from the Talmud through later rabbinical literature (examining 32 authorities, beginning with the Talmud and ending with the works of Rabbi Israel Isserlein). The &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; (literally &quot;set table&quot;) is, in turn, a condensation of the &quot;Beit Yosef&quot; – stating each ruling simply; this work follows the chapter divisions of the &quot;Tur&quot;. The &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, together with its related commentaries, is considered by many to be the most authoritative compilation of &quot;halakha&quot; since the Talmud. In writing the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, Rabbi Karo based his rulings on three authorities – Maimonides, Asher ben Jehiel (Rosh), and Isaac Alfasi (Rif); he considered &quot;the Mordechai&quot; in inconclusive cases. Sephardic Jews, generally, refer to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; as the basis for their daily practice.
* The works of Rabbi Moshe Isserles (&quot;Rema&quot;; Kraków, Poland, 1525 to 1572). Isserles noted that the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; was based on the Sephardic tradition, and he created a series of glosses to be appended to the text of the Shulkhan Aruch for cases where Sephardi and Ashkenazi customs differed (based on the works of Yaakov Moelin, Israel Isserlein, and Israel Bruna). The glosses are called &quot;ha-Mapah&quot; (&quot;the Tablecloth&quot;). His comments are now incorporated into the body of all printed editions of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, typeset in a different script; today, &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; refers to the combined work of Karo and Isserles. Isserles&#x27; &quot;Darkhei Moshe&quot; is similarly a commentary on the &quot;Tur&quot; and the &quot;Beit Yosef&quot;.
* The &quot;Levush Malkhut&quot; (&quot;Levush&quot;) of Rabbi Mordecai Yoffe (c. 1530–1612). A ten-volume work, five discussing &quot;halakha&quot; at a level &quot;midway between the two extremes: the lengthy &quot;Beit Yosef&quot; of Karo on the one hand, and on the other Karo&#x27;s &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; together with the &quot;Mappah&quot; of Isserles, which is too brief&quot;, that particularly stresses the customs and practices of the Jews of Eastern Europe. The Levush was exceptional among the codes, in that it treated certain &quot;Halakhot&quot; from a Kabbalistic standpoint.
* The &quot;Shulchan Aruch HaRav&quot; of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (c. 1800) was an attempt to re-codify the law as it stood at that time – incorporating commentaries on the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, and subsequent responsa – and thus stating the decided &quot;halakha&quot;, as well as the underlying reasoning. The work was written partly so that laymen would be able to study Jewish law. Unfortunately, most of the work was lost in a fire prior to publication. It is the basis of practice for Chabad-Lubavitch and other Hasidic groups and is quoted as authoritative by many subsequent works, Hasidic and non-Hasidic alike.
* Works structured directly on the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, providing analysis in light of Acharonic material and codes:
** The Mishnah Berurah of Rabbi Yisroel Meir ha-Kohen, (the &quot;Chofetz Chaim&quot;, Poland, 1838–1933) is a commentary on the &quot;Orach Chayim&quot; section of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, discussing the application of each &quot;halakha&quot; in light of all subsequent Acharonic decisions. It has become the authoritative halakhic guide for much of Orthodox Ashkenazic Jewry in the postwar period.
** Aruch HaShulchan by Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein (1829–1888) is a scholarly analysis of &quot;halakha&quot; through the perspective of the major Rishonim. The work follows the structure of the &quot;Tur&quot; and the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;; rules dealing with vows, agriculture, and ritual purity, are discussed in a second work known as &quot;Aruch HaShulchan he&#x27;Atid&quot;.
** Kaf HaChaim on Orach Chayim and parts of Yoreh De&#x27;ah, by the Sephardi sage Yaakov Chaim Sofer (Baghdad and Jerusalem, 1870–1939) is similar in scope, authority and approach to the Mishnah Berurah. This work also surveys the views of many kabbalistic sages (particularly Isaac Luria), when these impact the Halakha.
** Yalkut Yosef, by Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef, is a voluminous, widely cited and contemporary work of &quot;halakha&quot;, based on the rulings of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef (1920–2013).
** Piskei T&#x27;shuvot, by Rabbi Ben-Zion Simcha Isaac Rabinowitz, is a commentary on the Halakhic decrees of Rabbi Yosef Karo in the Orach Chayim section of the Shulchan Aruch and those of Rabbi Yisroel Meir ha-Kohen in the Mishna Berura. Based on the collected opinions of various contemporary Acharonim, it includes practical solutions and instructions for Halakhic issues common to the modern way of life, and is generally oriented towards the decrees of the Hassidic Halakhic authorities.
** P&#x27;sakim U&#x27;T&#x27;shuvot, by Rabbi Aharon Aryeh Katz, the son in law of Rabbi Ben-Zion Simcha Isaac Rabinowitz, is a commentary on the Halakhic decrees of Rabbi Yosef Karo in the Yoreh De&#x27;ah section of the Shulchan Aruch, in a format almost identical to that of the Piskei Teshuvot.
* Layman-oriented works of &quot;halakha&quot;:
** Thesouro dos Dinim (&quot;Treasury of religious rules&quot;) by Menasseh Ben Israel (1604–1657) is a reconstituted version of the Shulkhan Arukh, written in Portuguese with the explicit purpose of helping &quot;conversos&quot; from Iberia reintergrate into halakhic Judaism.
**The &quot;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch&quot; of Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried (Hungary 1804–1886), a &quot;digest&quot;, covering applicable Halakha from all four sections of &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, and reflecting the very strict Hungarian customs of the 19th century. It became immensely popular after its publication due to its simplicity, and is still popular in Orthodox Judaism as a framework for study, if not always for practice. This work is not considered binding in the same way as the Mishneh Torah or &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;.
** Chayei Adam and Chochmat Adam by Avraham Danzig (Poland, 1748–1820) are similar Ashkenazi works; the first covers &quot;Orach Chaim&quot;, the second in large &quot;Yoreh De&#x27;ah&quot;, as well as laws from &quot;Even Ha&#x27;ezer&quot; and &quot;Choshen Mishpat&quot; pertinent to everyday life.
** The Ben Ish Chai by Yosef Chaim (Baghdad, 1832–1909) is a collection of the laws on everyday life – parallel in scope to the &quot;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch&quot; – interspersed with mystical insights and customs, addressed to the masses and arranged by the weekly Torah portion. Its wide circulation and coverage has seen it become a standard reference work in Sephardi Halakha.
*Contemporary &quot;series&quot;:
** Peninei Halakha by Rabbi Eliezer Melamed. Fifteen volumes thus far, covering a wide range of subjects, from Shabbat to organ donations, and in addition to clearly posing the practical law – reflecting the customs of various communities – also discusses the spiritual foundations of the Halakhot. It is widely studied in the Religious Zionist community.
**&quot;Tzurba M’Rabanan&quot; by Rabbi Benzion Algazi. Six volumes covering 300 topics from all areas of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, &quot;from the Talmudic source through modern-day halachic application&quot;, similarly studied in the Religious Zionist community (and outside Israel, through Mizrachi in numerous Modern Orthodox communities; 15 bilingual translated volumes).
**&quot;Nitei Gavriel&quot; by Rabbi Gavriel Zinner. Thirty volumes on the entire spectrum of topics in &quot;halachah&quot;, known for addressing situations not commonly brought in other works, and for delineating the varying approaches amongst the &quot;Hasidic&quot; branches; for both reasons they are often reprinted.
* &quot;Temimei Haderech&quot; (&quot;A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice&quot;) by Rabbi Isaac Klein with contributions from the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly. This scholarly work is based on the previous traditional law codes, but written from a Conservative Jewish point of view, and not accepted among Orthodox Jews.

<doc id="13876" wikidata="Q193748" url="?curid=13876" title="History of ancient Israel and Judah">
<text>The history of ancient Israel and Judah spans from the early appearance of the Israelites in Canaan&#x27;s hill country during the late second millennium BCE, to the establishment and subsequent downfall of the two Israelite kingdoms in the mid-first millennium BCE. This history unfolds within the Southern Levant during the Iron Age. The earliest documented mention of &quot;Israel&quot; as a people appears on the Merneptah Stele, an ancient Egyptian inscription dating back to around 1208 BCE. Archaeological evidence suggests that ancient Israelite culture evolved from the pre-existing Canaanite civilization. During the Iron Age II period, two Israelite kingdoms emerged, covering much of Canaan: the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south.

According to the Hebrew Bible, a &quot;United Monarchy&quot; consisting of Israel and Judah existed as early as the 11th century BCE, under the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon; the great kingdom later was separated into two smaller kingdoms: Israel, containing the cities of Shechem and Samaria, in the north, and Judah, containing Jerusalem and Solomon&#x27;s Temple, in the south. The historicity of the United Monarchy is debated—as there are no archaeological remains of it that are accepted as consensus—but historians and archaeologists agree that Israel and Judah existed as separate kingdoms by and , respectively. The kingdoms&#x27; history is known in greater detail than that of other kingdoms in the Levant, primarily due to the selective narratives in the Books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, which were included in the Bible.

The northern Kingdom of Israel was destroyed around 720 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. While the Kingdom of Judah remained intact during this time, it became a client state of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire and then the Neo-Babylonian Empire. However, Jewish revolts against the Babylonians led to the destruction of Judah in 586 BCE, under the rule of Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II. According to the biblical account, the armies of Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem between 589 and 586 BCE, which led to the destruction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple and the exile of the Jews to Babylon; this event was also recorded in the Babylonian Chronicles. The exilic period saw the development of the Israelite religion towards a monotheistic Judaism.

The exile ended with the fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid Empire . Subsequently, the Achaemenid king Cyrus the Great issued a proclamation known as the Edict of Cyrus, which authorized and encouraged exiled Jews to return to Judah. Cyrus&#x27; proclamation began the exiles&#x27; return to Zion, inaugurating the formative period in which a more distinctive Jewish identity developed in the Persian province of Yehud. During this time, the destroyed Solomon&#x27;s Temple was replaced by the Second Temple, marking the beginning of the Second Temple period.

==Periods==
* Iron Age I: 1150–950 BCE
* Iron Age II: 950–586 BCE
The Iron Age II period is followed by periods named after conquering empires, such as the Neo-Babylonians becoming the &quot;godfathers&quot; for the Babylonian period ().

Other academic terms often used are:
* &quot;First Temple&quot; or &quot;Israelite period&quot; ()
The return to Zion and the construction of the Second Temple marked the beginning of the Second Temple period (70 CE).

==Background: Late Bronze Age (1550–1150 BCE)==
The eastern Mediterranean seaboard stretches 400 miles north to south from the Taurus Mountains to the Sinai Peninsula, and 100 to 150 km east to west between the sea and the Arabian Desert. The coastal plain of the southern Levant, broad in the south and narrowing to the north, is backed in its southernmost portion by a zone of foothills, the Shfela; like the plain this narrows as it goes northwards, ending in the promontory of Mount Carmel. East of the plain and the Shfela is a mountainous ridge, the &quot;hill country of Judea&quot; in the south, the &quot;hill country of Ephraim&quot; north of that, then Galilee and Mount Lebanon. To the east again lie the steep-sided valley occupied by the Jordan River, the Dead Sea, and the wadi of the Arabah, which continues down to the eastern arm of the Red Sea. Beyond the plateau is the Syrian desert, separating the Levant from Mesopotamia. To the southwest is Egypt, to the northeast Mesopotamia. The location and geographical characteristics of the narrow Levant made the area a battleground among the powerful entities that surrounded it.

Canaan in the Late Bronze Age was a shadow of what it had been centuries earlier: many cities were abandoned, others shrank in size, and the total settled population was probably not much more than a hundred thousand. Settlement was concentrated in cities along the coastal plain and along major communication routes; the central and northern hill country which would later become the biblical kingdom of Israel was only sparsely inhabited although letters from the Egyptian archives indicate that Jerusalem was already a Canaanite city-state recognizing Egyptian overlordship. Politically and culturally it was dominated by Egypt, each city under its own ruler, constantly at odds with its neighbours, and appealing to the Egyptians to adjudicate their differences.

The Canaanite city state system broke down during the Late Bronze Age collapse, and Canaanite culture was then gradually absorbed into those of the Philistines, Phoenicians and Israelites. The process was gradual and a strong Egyptian presence continued into the 12th century BCE, and, while some Canaanite cities were destroyed, others continued to exist in Iron Age I.

The name &quot;Israel&quot; first appears in the Merneptah Stele : &quot;Israel is laid waste and his seed is no more.&quot; This &quot;Israel&quot; was a cultural and probably political entity, well enough established for the Egyptians to perceive it as a possible challenge, but an ethnic group rather than an organized state.

==Iron Age I (1150–950 BCE)==
In the Late Bronze Age there were no more than about 25 villages in the highlands, but this increased to over 300 by the end of Iron Age I, while the settled population doubled from 20,000 to 40,000. The villages were more numerous and larger in the north, and probably shared the highlands with pastoral nomads, who left no remains. Archaeologists and historians attempting to trace the origins of these villagers have found it impossible to identify any distinctive features that could define them as specifically Israelite collared-rim jars and four-room houses have been identified outside the highlands and thus cannot be used to distinguish Israelite sites, and while the pottery of the highland villages is far more limited than that of lowland Canaanite sites, it develops typologically out of Canaanite pottery that came before. Israel Finkelstein proposed that the oval or circular layout that distinguishes some of the earliest highland sites, and the notable absence of pig bones from hill sites, could be taken as markers of ethnicity, but others have cautioned that these can be a &quot;common-sense&quot; adaptation to highland life and not necessarily revelatory of origins. Other Aramaean sites also demonstrate a contemporary absence of pig remains at that time, unlike earlier Canaanite and later Philistine excavations.

In &quot;The Bible Unearthed&quot; (2001), Finkelstein and Silberman summarized recent studies. They described how, up until 1967, the Israelite heartland in the highlands of western Palestine was virtually an archaeological terra incognita. Since then, intensive surveys have examined the traditional territories of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh. These surveys have revealed the sudden emergence of a new culture contrasting with the Philistine and Canaanite societies existing in Canaan in the Iron Age. This new culture is characterized by a lack of pork remains (whereas pork formed 20% of the Philistine diet in places), by an abandonment of the Philistine/Canaanite custom of having highly decorated pottery, and by the practice of circumcision. The Israelite ethnic identity had originated, not from the Exodus and a subsequent conquest, but from a transformation of the existing Canaanite-Philistine cultures.
Modern scholars therefore see Israel arising peacefully and internally from existing people in the highlands of Canaan.

Extensive archaeological excavations have provided a picture of Israelite society during the early Iron Age period. The archaeological evidence indicates a society of village-like centres, but with more limited resources and a small population. During this period, Israelites lived primarily in small villages, the largest of which had populations of up to 300 or 400. Their villages were built on hilltops. Their houses were built in clusters around a common courtyard. They built three- or four-room houses out of mudbrick with a stone foundation and sometimes with a second story made of wood. The inhabitants lived by farming and herding. They built terraces to farm on hillsides, planting various crops and maintaining orchards. The villages were largely economically self-sufficient and economic interchange was prevalent. According to the Bible, prior to the rise of the Israelite monarchy the early Israelites were led by the Biblical judges, or chieftains who served as military leaders in times of crisis. Scholars are divided over the historicity of this account. However, it is likely that regional chiefdoms and polities provided security. The small villages were unwalled but were likely subjects of the major town in the area. Writing was known and available for recording, even at small sites.

==Iron Age II (950–587 BCE)==

According to Israel Finkelstein, after an emergent and large polity was suddenly formed based on the Gibeon-Gibeah plateau and destroyed by Shoshenq I, the biblical Shishak, in the 10th century BCE, a return to small city-states was prevalent in the Southern Levant, but between another large polity emerged in the northern highlands with its capital eventually at Tirzah, that can be considered the precursor of the Kingdom of Israel. The Kingdom of Israel was consolidated as an important regional power by the first half of the 9th century BCE, before falling to the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 722 BCE, and the Kingdom of Judah began to flourish in the second half of the 9th century BCE. 

Unusually favourable climatic conditions in the first two centuries of Iron Age II brought about an expansion of population, settlements and trade throughout the region. In the central highlands this resulted in unification in a kingdom with the city of Samaria as its capital, possibly by the second half of the 10th century BCE when an inscription of the Egyptian pharaoh Shoshenq I records a series of campaigns directed at the area. Israel had clearly emerged in the first half of the 9th century BCE, this is attested when the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III names &quot;Ahab Sir&#x27;lit&quot; among his enemies at the battle of Qarqar (853 BCE) on the Kurkh Monoliths. This &quot;Sir&#x27;lit&quot; is most often interpreted as &quot;Israel&quot;. At this time Israel was apparently engaged in a three-way contest with Damascus and Tyre for control of the Jezreel Valley and Galilee in the north, and with Moab, Ammon and Aram Damascus in the east for control of Gilead; the Mesha Stele (), left by a king of Moab, celebrates his success in throwing off the oppression of the &quot;House of Omri&quot; (i.e., Israel). It bears what is generally thought to be the earliest extra-biblical reference to the name &quot;Yahweh&quot;. A century later Israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding Neo-Assyrian Empire, which first split its territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital, Samaria (). Both the biblical and Assyrian sources speak of a massive deportation of people from Israel and their replacement with settlers from other parts of the empire such population exchanges were an established part of Assyrian imperial policy, a means of breaking the old power structure and the former Israel never again became an independent political entity.
Finkelstein holds that Judah emerged as an operational kingdom somewhat later than Israel, during the second half of 9th century BCE, but the subject is one of considerable controversy. There are indications that during the 10th and 9th centuries BCE, the southern highlands had been divided between a number of centres, none with clear primacy. During the reign of Hezekiah, between , a notable increase in the power of the Judean state can be observed. This is reflected in archaeological sites and findings, such as the Broad Wall; a defensive city wall in Jerusalem; and the Siloam tunnel, an aqueduct designed to provide Jerusalem with water during an impending siege by the Neo-Assyrian Empire led by Sennacherib; and the Siloam inscription, a lintel inscription found over the doorway of a tomb, has been ascribed to comptroller Shebna. LMLK seals on storage jar handles, excavated from strata in and around that formed by Sennacherib&#x27;s destruction, appear to have been used throughout Sennacherib&#x27;s 29-year reign, along with bullae from sealed documents, some that belonged to Hezekiah himself and others that name his servants.

Archaeological records indicate that the Kingdom of Israel was fairly prosperous. The late Iron Age saw an increase in urban development in Israel. Whereas previously the Israelites had lived mainly in small and unfortified settlements, the rise of the Kingdom of Israel saw the growth of cities and the construction of palaces, large royal enclosures, and fortifications with walls and gates. Israel initially had to invest significant resources into defence as it was subjected to regular Aramean incursions and attacks, but after the Arameans were subjugated by the Assyrians and Israel could afford to put less resources into defending its territory, its architectural infrastructure grew dramatically. Extensive fortifications were built around cities such as Dan, Megiddo, and Hazor, including monumental and multi-towered city walls and multi-gate entry systems. Israel&#x27;s economy was based on multiple industries. It had the largest olive oil production centres in the region, using at least two different types of olive oil presses, and also had a significant wine industry, with wine presses constructed next to vineyards. By contrast, the Kingdom of Judah was significantly less advanced. Some scholars believe it was no more than a small tribal entity limited to Jerusalem and its immediate surroundings. In the 10th and early 9th centuries BCE, the territory of Judah appears to have been sparsely populated, limited to small and mostly unfortified settlements. The status of Jerusalem in the 10th century BCE is a major subject of debate among scholars. According to some scholars, Jerusalem does not show evidence of significant Israelite residential activity until the 9th century BCE. Other scholars argue that recent discoveries and radiocarbon tests in the City of David seem to indicate that Jerusalem was already a significant city by the 10th century BCE. Significant administrative structures such as the Stepped Stone Structure and Large Stone Structure, which originally formed part of one structure, also contain material culture from the 10th century BCE or earlier. The ruins of a significant Judahite military fortress, Tel Arad, have also been found in the Negev, and a collection of military orders found there suggest literacy was present throughout the ranks of the Judahite army. This suggests that literacy was not limited to a tiny elite, indicating the presence of a substantial educational infrastructure in Judah.In the 7th century Jerusalem grew to contain a population many times greater than earlier and achieved clear dominance over its neighbours. This occurred at the same time that Israel was being destroyed by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and was probably the result of a cooperative arrangement with the Assyrians to establish Judah as an Assyrian vassal state controlling the valuable olive industry. Judah prospered as a vassal state (despite a disastrous rebellion against Sennacherib), but in the last half of the 7th century BCE, Assyria suddenly collapsed, and the ensuing competition between Egypt and the Neo-Babylonian Empire for control of the land led to the destruction of Judah in a series of campaigns between 597 and 582.

==Aftermath: Assyrian and Babylonian periods==

After its fall, the former Kingdom of Israel became the Assyrian province of Samerina, which was taken over about a century later by the Neo-Babylonian Empire, created after the revolt of the Babylonians and them defeating the Neo-Assyrian Empire.
Babylonian Judah suffered a steep decline in both economy and population and lost the Negev, the Shephelah, and part of the Judean hill country, including Hebron, to encroachments from Edom and other neighbours. Jerusalem, destroyed but probably not totally abandoned, was much smaller than previously, and the settlements surrounding it, as well as the towns in the former kingdom&#x27;s western borders, were all devastated as a result of the Babylonian campaign. The town of Mizpah in Benjamin in the relatively unscathed northern section of the kingdom became the capital of the new Babylonian province of Yehud. This was standard Babylonian practice: when the Philistine city of Ashkalon was conquered in 604, the political, religious and economic elite (but not the bulk of the population) was banished and the administrative centre shifted to a new location. There is also a strong probability that for most or all of the period the temple at Bethel in Benjamin replaced that at Jerusalem, boosting the prestige of Bethel&#x27;s priests (the Aaronites) against those of Jerusalem (the Zadokites), now in exile in Babylon.

The Babylonian conquest entailed not just the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, but the liquidation of the entire infrastructure which had sustained Judah for centuries. The most significant casualty was the state ideology of &quot;Zion theology,&quot; the idea that the god of Israel had chosen Jerusalem for his dwelling-place and that the Davidic dynasty would reign there forever. The fall of the city and the end of Davidic kingship forced the leaders of the exile community kings, priests, scribes and prophets to reformulate the concepts of community, faith and politics. The exile community in Babylon thus became the source of significant portions of the Hebrew Bible: Isaiah 40–55; Ezekiel; the final version of Jeremiah; the work of the hypothesized priestly source in the Pentateuch; and the final form of the history of Israel from Deuteronomy to 2 Kings. Theologically, the Babylonian exiles were responsible for the doctrines of individual responsibility and universalism (the concept that one god controls the entire world) and for the increased emphasis on purity and holiness. Most significantly, the trauma of the exile experience led to the development of a strong sense of Hebrew identity distinct from other peoples, with increased emphasis on symbols such as circumcision and Sabbath-observance to sustain that distinction.

Hans M. Barstad writes that the concentration of the biblical literature on the experience of the exiles in Babylon disguises that the great majority of the population remained in Judah; for them, life after the fall of Jerusalem probably went on much as it had before. It may even have improved, as they were rewarded with the land and property of the deportees, much to the anger of the community of exiles remaining in Babylon. Conversely, Avraham Faust writes that archaeological and demographic surveys show that the population of Judah was significantly reduced to barely 10% of what it had been in the time before the exile. The assassination around 582 of the Babylonian governor by a disaffected member of the former royal House of David provoked a Babylonian crackdown, possibly reflected in the Book of Lamentations, but the situation seems to have soon stabilized again. Nevertheless, those unwalled cities and towns that remained were subject to slave raids by the Phoenicians and intervention in their internal affairs by Samaritans, Arabs, and Ammonites.

==Religion==
Although the specific process by which the Israelites adopted monotheism is unknown, it is certain that the transition was a gradual one and was not totally accomplished during the First Temple period. More is known about this period, as during this time writing was widespread. The number of gods that the Israelites worshipped decreased, and figurative images vanished from their shrines. Yahwism, as some scholars name this belief system, is often described as a form of henotheism or monolatry. Over the same time, a folk religion continued to be practised across Israel and Judah. These practices were influenced by the polytheistic beliefs of the surrounding ethnicities, and were denounced by the prophets.

In addition to the Temple in Jerusalem, there was public worship practised all over Israel and Judah in shrines and sanctuaries, outdoors, and close to city gates. In the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, the kings Hezekiah and Josiah of Judah implemented a number of significant religious reforms that aimed to centre worship of the God of Israel in Jerusalem and eliminate foreign customs.

===Henotheism===

Henotheism is the act of worshipping a single god, without denying the existence of other deities. Many scholars believe that before monotheism in ancient Israel, there came a transitional period; in this transitional period many followers of the Israelite religion worshipped the god Yahweh, but did not deny the existence of other deities accepted throughout the region. Henotheistic worship was not uncommon in the Ancient Near East, as many Iron Age nation states worshipped an elevated national god which was nonetheless only part of a wider pantheon; examples include Chemosh in Moab, Qos in Edom, Milkom in Ammon, and Ashur in Assyria.

Canaanite religion syncretized elements from neighbouring cultures, largely from Mesopotamian religious traditions. Using Canaanite religion as a base was natural due to the fact that the Canaanite culture inhabited the same region prior to the emergence of Israelite culture. Israelite religion was no exception, as during the transitional period, Yahweh and El were syncretized in the Israelite pantheon. El already occupied a reasonably important place in the Israelite religion. Even the name &quot;Israel&quot; is based on the name El, rather than Yahweh. It was this initial harmonization of Israelite and Canaanite religious thought that led to Yahweh gradually absorbing several characteristics from Canaanite deities, in turn strengthening his own position as an all-powerful &quot;One.&quot; Even still, monotheism in the region of ancient Israel and Judah did not take hold overnight, and during the intermediate stages most people are believed to have remained henotheistic.

During this intermediate period of henotheism many families worshipped different gods. Religion was very much centred around the family, as opposed to the community. The region of Israel and Judah was sparsely populated during the time of Moses. As such many different areas worshipped different gods, due to social isolation. It was not until later on in Israelite history that people started to worship Yahweh alone and fully convert to monotheistic values. That switch occurred with the growth of power and influence of the Israelite kingdom and its rulers. Further details of this are contained in the Iron Age Yahwism section below. Evidence from the Bible suggests that henotheism did exist: &quot;They [the Hebrews] went and served alien gods and paid homage to them, gods of whom they had no experience and whom he [Yahweh] did not allot to them&quot; (Deut. 29.26). Many believe that this quote demonstrates that the early Israelite kingdom followed traditions similar to ancient Mesopotamia, where each major urban centre had a supreme god. Each culture embraced their patron god but did not deny the existence of other cultures&#x27; patron gods. In Assyria, the patron god was Ashur, and in ancient Israel, it was Yahweh; however, both Israelite and Assyrian cultures recognized each other&#x27;s deities during this period. Some scholars have used the Bible as evidence to argue that most of the people alive during the events recounted in the Hebrew Bible, including Moses, were most likely henotheists. There are many quotes from the Hebrew Bible that are used to support this view. One such quote from Jewish tradition is the first commandment which in its entirety reads &quot;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: You shall have no other gods before me.&quot; This quote does not deny the existence of other gods; it merely states that Jews should consider Yahweh or God the supreme god, incomparable to other supernatural beings. Some scholars attribute the concept of angels and demons found in Judaism and Christianity to the tradition of henotheism. Instead of completely getting rid of the concept of other supernatural beings, these religions changed former deities into angels and demons.

===Iron Age Yahwism===
The religion of the Israelites of Iron Age I, like the Ancient Canaanite religion from which it evolved and other religions of the ancient Near East, was based on a cult of ancestors and worship of family gods (the &quot;gods of the fathers&quot;). With the emergence of the monarchy at the beginning of Iron Age II the kings promoted their family god, Yahweh, as the god of the kingdom, but beyond the royal court, religion continued to be both polytheistic and family-centred. The major deities were not numerousEl, Asherah, and Yahweh, with Baal as a fourth god, and perhaps Shamash (the sun) in the early period. At an early stage El and Yahweh became fused and Asherah did not continue as a separate state cult, although she continued to be popular at a community level until Persian times.

Yahweh, the national god of both Israel and Judah, seems to have originated in Edom and Midian in southern Canaan and may have been brought to Israel by the Kenites and Midianites at an early stage. There is a general consensus among scholars that the first formative event in the emergence of the distinctive religion described in the Bible was triggered by the destruction of Israel by Assyria in . Refugees from the northern kingdom fled to Judah, bringing with them laws and a prophetic tradition of Yahweh. This religion was subsequently adopted by the landowners of Judah, who in 640 BCE placed the eight-year-old Josiah on the throne. Judah at this time was a vassal state of Assyria, but Assyrian power collapsed in the 630s, and around 622 Josiah and his supporters launched a bid for independence expressed as loyalty to &quot;Yahweh alone&quot;.

===The Babylonian exile and Second Temple Judaism===

According to the Deuteronomists, as scholars call these Judean nationalists, the treaty with Yahweh would enable Israel&#x27;s god to preserve both the city and the king in return for the people&#x27;s worship and obedience. The destruction of Jerusalem, its Temple, and the Davidic dynasty by Babylon in 587/586 BCE was deeply traumatic and led to revisions of the national mythos during the Babylonian exile. This revision was expressed in the Deuteronomistic history, the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings, which interpreted the Babylonian destruction as divinely-ordained punishment for the failure of Israel&#x27;s kings to worship Yahweh to the exclusion of all other deities.

The Second Temple period (520 BCE70 CE) differed in significant ways from what had gone before. Strict monotheism emerged among the priests of the Temple establishment during the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, as did beliefs regarding angels and demons. At this time, circumcision, dietary laws, and Sabbath-observance gained more significance as symbols of Jewish identity, and the institution of the synagogue became increasingly important, and most of the biblical literature, including the Torah, was substantially revised during this time.

== Administrative and judicial structure ==

As was customary in the ancient Near East, a king () ruled over the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The national god Yahweh, who selects those to rule his realm and his people, is depicted in the Hebrew Bible as having a hand in the establishment of the royal institution. In this sense, the true king is God, and the king serves as his earthly envoy and is tasked with ruling his realm. In some Psalms that appear to be related to the coronation of kings, they are referred to as &quot;sons of Yahweh&quot;. The kings actually had to succeed one another according to a dynastic principle, even though the succession was occasionally decided through coups d&#x27;état. The coronation seemed to take place in a sacred place, and was marked by the anointing of the king who then becomes the &quot;anointed one (māšîaḥ, the origin of the word Messiah) of Yahweh&quot;; the end of the ritual seems marked by an acclamation by the people (or at least their representatives, the Elders), followed by a banquet.

The Bible&#x27;s descriptions of the lists of dignitaries from the reigns of David and Solomon show that the king is supported by a group of high dignitaries. Those include the chief of the army (), the great scribe () who was in charge of the management of the royal chancellery, the herald (), as well as the high priest () and the master of the palace (), who has a function of stewardship of the household of the king at the beginning and seems to become a real prime minister of Judah during the later periods. The attributions of most of these dignitaries remain debated, as illustrated in particular by the much-discussed case of the “king&#x27;s friend” mentioned under Solomon.

<text>The monarchs of Iran were the rulers of the various states and civilizations in Iran (Persia) from antiquity until the abolition of the Iranian monarchy in the Iranian Revolution (1979).

The earliest Iranian empire is generally considered to have been either the Median ( 727–550 BC) or succeeding Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC) After Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of the Achaemenid Empire (beginning in 334 BC and mostly complete by 330 BC), much of Iran was under Hellenistic rule for two centuries, primarily under the Seleucid Empire (305–129 BC). Native Iranian rule was revived with the establishment of the Parthian Empire (247 BC–224 AD). The Parthians were succeeded by the Sasanian Empire (224 AD –651 AD), which ruled Iran until the Muslim conquest.

Medieval Iran was alternated between being ruled by large foreign empires and being divided into several smaller kingdoms. Most of the Sasanian lands were initially incorporated in the Rashidun Caliphate (633–661), as well as the succeeding Umayyad (661–750) and Abbasid (750–1258) caliphates. Diminishing authority of the caliphs led to the Iranian Intermezzo, when various Iranian warlords established their own dynasties and kingdoms, some of which revived Sasanian royal iconography and ideology. In the eleventh century, Iran was conquered by the Turkic (though culturally Persianate) Seljuk Empire (1038–1194), which was followed by succeeding conquests by various Persianate Turkic and Mongolian conquerors, most notably the Khwarazmian (1077–1220), Mongol (1220–1259), and Timurid (1370–1458) empires.

Native Iranian political unity was restored in 1501 through the Safavid Empire (1501–1722). The collapse of the Safavid Empire led to an intermediate period of turmoil, with rule contested between Safavid dynasts as well as the Hotak dynasty (1722–1729). Nader Shah replaced these with the Afsharid Empire (1736–1796), but after his assassination in 1747 the Afsharids competed with the Zand (1751–1794) dynasty under Karim Khan Zand and his successors for supremacy. Iran was reunified by the Qajar dynasty (1789–1925), which was followed by the Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979), the last imperial dynasty of Iran. Since the revolution in 1979, Iran has been ruled by theocratic supreme leaders.

== Ancient Iran (c. 727 BC–AD 651) ==

=== Medes (c. 678–550 BC) ===
The Median dynasty is traditionally considered to have ruled the earliest Iranian state. Whether the Medes ruled an imperial state or merely a loose tribal confederation is disputed among historians. Median history is reconstructed almost solely through ancient Greek sources (particularly Herodotus) and disregards Near Eastern sources, which are fragmentary and do not support the existence of a unified Median Empire. There is also no material or textual evidence left behind by the supposed empire itself. The chronology and names of the Median kings mainly derives from the work of Herodotus.

No ruling title is securely attested for the Median rulers. They might have used the title &quot;xšāyaθiya xšāyaθiyānām&quot; (&quot;King of Kings&quot;). Ecbatana was the Median capital.


=== Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC) ===
The Achaemenid dynasty originated as local rulers of Anshan under Median suzerainty. They are attributed various ancestors in later legends, including an eponymous figure called &quot;Achaemenes&quot;. The earliest securely historical Achaemenid ruler is Cyrus I, king of Anshan in the second half of the seventh century BC. The Achaemenids united all Persian tribes under Cyrus I&#x27;s son Cambyses I. Under Cambyses I&#x27;s son, Cyrus II, the Achaemenids defeated the Medes and established the Achaemenid Empire, the largest ever Iranian state.

The standard title used by Achaemenid rulers in Iran from Cyrus II onwards was &quot;xšāyaθiya xšāyaθiyānām&quot;, &quot;xšāyaθiya dahyūnām&quot; (&quot;King of Kings, King of the Lands&quot;). The royal title varied in other parts of the empire. The Achaemenids had several royal cities, including Pasargadae, Susa, Ecbatana, Babylon, Bactra, and Persepolis.

=== Hellenistic rule (331–129 BC) ===
==== Alexander&#x27;s empire (331–305 BC) ====
The Achaemenid Empire was defeated and conquered by Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia, in 331–329 BC. After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, the Wars of the Diadochi broke out between his successors, leading to the rapid disintegration of the empire.

Alexander did not assume the former Achaemenid royal title of &#x27;King of Kings&#x27;. His main royal title, appearing on coins intended for his Asian territories, was instead &quot;basileus&quot; (&quot;king&quot;). To mark his rule over the Achaemenid territories he also sometimes used the new title &quot;Lord of Asia&quot; (sometimes &quot;King of Asia&quot;). The only royal title recorded for Alexander&#x27;s two immediate heirs is &quot;basileus&quot;. Alexander ruled his empire from Babylon and planned to establish Babylon and Alexandria in Egypt as the twin imperial capitals. From 319 BC onwards, Alexander&#x27;s heirs resided in Macedonia while the regency in Asia was contested by several generals.

==== Seleucid Empire (305–129 BC) ====
The main Hellenistic successors of Alexander&#x27;s empire in Iran were the Seleucids, descendants of the Macedonian general Seleucus I Nicator and the Iranian noblewoman Apama. Seleucus seized most of the east, including Babylonia, in the Wars of the Diadochi and was firmly in control in the region from 312 BC onwards. After Alexander IV&#x27;s death became public knowledge in 305 BC, Seleucus proclaimed himself king.

The main royal title used by the Seleucids was &quot;basileus&quot;, as was the case for the other Macedonian successor kingdoms (such as the Ptolemaic Kingdom). Only two Seleucid rulers (Antiochus III, 223–187 BC, and Antiochus VII, 139–129 BC) used the greater &quot;megas basileus&quot; (&#x27;Great King&#x27;), the style applied to Achaemenid kings in ancient Greek sources. The Seleucids at first ruled from Seleucia in Mesopotamia, though Antioch was soon made the main capital.

=== Parthian Empire (247 BC–224 AD) ===
The Arsacids of Parthia, initially Seleucid vassals, originated as leaders of the Iranian Parni tribe in the northeastern steppes. The Parthians gradually challenged Seleucid rule over Iran. Parthian control of Iran was secured through the c. 142 BC conquest of Babylonia. Although fighting continued for years, the death of Antiochus VII Sidetes in 129 BC effectively marked the collapse of the Seleucid Empire, which then lingered on as a rump state in Syria until conquered by the Roman Empire in the 60s BC.

The Parthians presented themselves as heirs of the Achaemenids, though ruled a much more decentralized state. Greek inscriptions were used on Parthian coins until the time of Vologases I (AD 51–78). Early Parthian rulers used the name of their dynastic founder (Arsaces) as a title. Their coins also have the legend &quot;krny&quot; (probably short for &quot;autokrator&quot;, i.e. autocrat or sole ruler). From the conquest of Babylonia onwards, rulers used &quot;basileus megas&quot; (&#x27;Great King&#x27;). Mithridates II (123–91 BC) adopted the Achaemenid &#x27;King of Kings&#x27; (rendered in Greek as &quot;basileus basileon&quot;). After him, this title was used only by Mithridates IV (57–54 BC) and Orodes II (57–37 BC) before becoming a standard part of the Parthian title from the time of Phraates IV (26–2 BC) onwards. The title was used in its Persian form (&quot;šāhān šāh&quot;) after Greek ceased being used. The first Parthian capital was at Nisa in Parthia. In 217 BC, the capital was moved to Qumis and in 50 BC a multi-capital system was established, with royal residences at Ctesiphon, Ecbatana, and Ray.

This list omits rival kings and claimants. Because of poor source material there are alternate chronologies, genealogies, and enumerations of Parthian rulers, with some differences. See the list of monarchs of Parthia.


=== Sasanian Empire (224 AD–651 AD) ===
The Sasanian dynasty originated as kings of Persis, a Parthian vassal kingdom, and claimed Achaemenid descent. In 224–226, the Sasanian dynast Ardashir I led a revolt against the Parthians, weakened in a recent civil war, and took control of the empire. Ardashir presented himself as a restorer of both regional unity and Achaemenid glory. The Sasanian Empire was a significantly more militarily powerful, centralized, and aggressive state than the Parthian Empire and was also marked by a state-backed and less heterodox form of the Zoroastrian religion.

Sasanian kings continued to use the title &quot;šāhān šāh&quot; (&#x27;King of Kings&#x27;). The title was extended by Ardashir to &quot;šāhān šāh ērān&quot; (&#x27;King of Kings of Iran&#x27;) and extended again by his son Shapur I (240–270) to &quot;šāhān šāh ērān ud anērān&quot; (&#x27;King of Kings of Iran and non-Iran&#x27;). Sasanian queens ruled with the title &quot;bānbišnān bānbišn ērān ud anērān&quot; (&#x27;Queen of Queens of Iran and non-Iran&#x27;).&quot;&quot; Ctesiphon was the capital of the Sasanian Empire.
=== Minor kingdoms and dynasties ===
* The Fratarakas (3rd–mid-2nd century BC), rulers/governors in Persis under the Seleucid Empire
* Rulers of Parthian sub-kingdoms (2nd century BC–5th century AD), various local vassal dynasties of the Parthian Empire
** The kings of Persis (2nd century BC–3rd century AD), vassal kings in Persis under the Parthian Empire

== Medieval Iran (651–1501) ==

The fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651 was followed by nearly a millennium without Iranian political unity, until the rise of the Safavid Empire in 1501. In the intervening period, the territories formerly part of the ancient Iranian empires were variously subjected to larger foreign empires or divided into several smaller political units. Although no unified Iranian state existed, shared Iranian identity, culture, and language continued to survive and develop throughout the Middle Ages.

The medieval dynasties and kingdoms featured in this list follow a 2012 list of Iranian ruling dynasties by the Iranologist Touraj Daryaee.

=== Arab (caliphal) rule (638–861) ===
==== Rashidun Caliphate (638–661) ====
The Muslim conquest of Persia began when the armies of the Rashidun Caliphate attacked parts of Sasanian Asoristan in 633. In 637/638, the Sasanians lost Mesopotamia and Persia itself was conquered in 640–650. By the time of Yazdegerd III&#x27;s death in 651, the Sasanians only retained Bactria. Following the Muslim victory, the Sasanian Empire was dissolved and Iran came under the direct rule of the Islamic caliphs. Although the caliphs implemented forms of ethnic stratification that discriminated against Iranians and their culture, particularly during the later Umayyad Caliphate (661–750), they also adopted much of the old Sasanian administrative model to govern their empire.

The style of the caliphs was &quot;amīr al-mu&#x27;minīn&quot; (&quot;commander of the faithful&quot;).&#x27; An additional title, &quot;khalīfat Allāh&quot; (&quot;deputy of God&quot;), was also introduced beginning with Uthman (644–656).&#x27; The caliphate was initially ruled from Medina. Under Ali, the capital was transferred to Kufa in Iraq.
==== Umayyad Caliphate (661–750) ====
The Umayyad Caliphate was established by Mu&#x27;awiya I, governor of Syria under the Rashidun caliphs. Mu&#x27;awiya opposed the acclamations of Ali and Hasan as caliphs, leading to the civil war known as the First Fitna (656–661). Mu&#x27;awiya was victorious and became undisputed caliph after Hasan relinquished his claims.

Umayyad caliphs continued to use the styles &quot;amīr al-mu&#x27;minīn&quot; and &quot;khalīfat Allāh&quot;.&#x27; The Umayyad Caliphate was ruled from Damascus, though the capital was briefly transferred to Harran under the last caliph, Marwan II.&#x27;
==== Abbasid Caliphate (749–861) ====
Because Mu&#x27;awiya took power in civil war, the rights of his and his descendants to the caliphate was long questioned. Anti-Umayyad insurrections were to a large degree supported by non-Arab converts to Islam (especially Iranians) who were resentful over being relegated to lower social standing. In 747–750, one of these insurrections grew into the Abbasid revolution, in which the Umayyads were replaced with the Abbasids, descendants of Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Abbas.

Abbasid caliphs continued to use the styles &quot;amīr al-mu&#x27;minīn&quot; and &quot;khalīfat Allāh&quot;.&#x27; The Abbasid Caliphate was ruled from Kufa, until the capital was transferred to the newly-founded Baghdad in 762.&#x27;
=== Iranian Intermezzo (821–1090) ===

The political authority of the Abbasid caliphs diminished over the course of the ninth and tenth centuries. In Iran, this led to the establishment of several independent Iranian dynasties, the ousting of Arabs from their scattered bastions across the country, and an Iranian cultural renaissance. The period between the collapse of Abbasid authority and the conquest of Iran by the Seljuk Turks in the eleventh century is referred to as the &quot;Iranian Intermezzo&quot;.

The Iranian Intermezzo saw the rise and fall of several major and minor dynasties. This list only includes major dynasties. Both Daryaee (2012) and Mahendrarajah (2019) list the major dynasties of the period as the Tahirids, Saffarids, Ziyarids, Buyids, and Samanids. Daryaee also includes the Ghaznavids, omitted by Mahendrarajah.

==== Tahirids (821–873) ====
The Tahirids were a dynasty of Islamic Iranian rulers who governed Khorasan and much of the rest of Iran under the Abbasid caliphs. The Tahirids enjoyed considerable autonomy in practice but were not &quot;de jure&quot; independent; Tahirid rulers fully acknowledged that they were subordinate viceroys, were always deferential to the caliphs, and regularly forwarded tribute to Baghdad. The Tahirids claimed descent from the Iranian mythological hero Rostam.

As vassals of the Caliphate, the Tahirid rulers used the title &quot;amir&quot;. The Tahirids initially ruled from Merv. The capital was transferred to Nishapur under Abdallah.
==== Saffarids (867–1002) ====
The Saffarids were a dynasty of Islamic Iranian rulers who at their height ruled much of Iran, and at times even reached into modern-day Iraq, from their base of power in Sistan. Although the dynastic founder Ya&#x27;qub (867–879) claimed Sasanian descent, the Saffarid dynasty originated as local ruffians and their power was attained solely through military might. The Saffarid state expanded aggressively under the rule of Ya&#x27;qub and Amr I (879–901), under which the Tahirids were defeated and the Abbasid Caliphate was forced to confirm Saffarid control over various Iranian territories.

Since they were nominally Abbasid subordinates, Saffarid rulers used the title &quot;amir&quot;. Zaranj served as the Saffarid capital.
==== Samanids (875–999) ====
The Samanids were a dynasty of Islamic Iranian rulers established by four brothers in 819, when they were granted four important cities and regions by the Abbasid Caliphate due to helping against the revolt of Rafi ibn al-Layth. In 875, the Samanids increased dramatically in power through investment as governors of Transoxiana and in 892, all Samanid-held territories were united under a single ruler (Ismail). Under Ismail, the Samanids became autonomous of the Abbasids. The Samanids claimed descent from Bahram VI Chobin (589–590).

Like other dynasties of their time, Samanid rulers used the title &quot;amir&quot;. Mansur I (961/962–976/977) assumed the style &quot;šāhānšāh&quot; (&#x27;King of Kings&#x27;) as a response to the use of that title by the Buyids. Mansur I&#x27;s son, Nuh II (976/977–997), also used &quot;šāhānšāh&quot;. The Samanid capital was at Samarkand (875–892) and then at Bukhara.

==== Ziyarids (927–1090) ====
The Ziyarids were a dynasty of Iranian rulers established in northern Iran by Mardavij, a local mountain chief and mercenary who created an extensive kingdom in the late 920s and early 930s. Mardavij claimed descent from local pre-Islamic nobility and aspired to capture Baghdad, overthrow the Abbasids, and restore both the pre-651 empire as well as the Zoroastrian religion. These aspirations came to an end with Mardavij&#x27;s murder by his Turkic military slaves in 934/935. Most of the Ziyarid realm was lost, except for territories surrounding the Caspian Sea, inherited by Mardavij&#x27;s Islamic relatives.

Mardavij may have revived the Sasanian ruling title &quot;šāhānšāh&quot; (&#x27;King of Kings&#x27;) since later Buyid writers attribute the title to him. Later Ziyarid rulers used the title &quot;amir&quot;. The Ziyarids went through a succession of capitals in northern Iran, including Ray, Amol, and Gorgan.
==== Buyids (934–1062) ====
The Buyids were a dynasty of Islamic Iranian rulers established by three brothers who had served under Mardavij (the first Ziyarid ruler). After Mardavij&#x27;s murder, the three carved out their own realm out of the southern Ziyarid territories. The Buyid state was composed of three principalities ruled by three branches of the family, sometimes with divergent goals, rather than a unified realm. The Buyids came to dominate much of Iran, a development that culminated in 945 with the capture of Baghdad and domination of the caliph himself. The Buyid dynasty claimed descent from the Sasanian king Bahram V (420–438), almost certainly a forgery.

Individual Buyid rulers were styled as &quot;amir&quot;. The senior of the three was also invested by the caliph with the grander title &quot;amīr al-­omarāʾ&quot; (&quot;great emir&quot;). The Buyid emirates were transformed into something akin to a restored Iranian monarchy under Rukn al-Dawla and his son &#x27;Adud al-Dawla, who also reintroduced the Sasanian royal title &quot;šāhānšāh&quot; (&#x27;King of Kings&#x27;). This title continued to be sporadically claimed by Buyid dynasts.

This list records only the &#x27;main branch&#x27; of Buyid rulers, per Daryaee (2012). For a full list of major and minor Buyid rulers, see Buyid dynasty § Buyid rulers.
==== Ghaznavids (977–1040) ====
The Ghaznavids were of Turkish slave origin. In the tenth century, Turkish slave commanders became increasingly prominent, and eventually effectively autonomous, in the southern parts of the Samanid realm. In 977, the commander Sabuktigin seized power in Ghazni, nominally as a Samanid vassal. Once the Samanids went into terminal decline and collapsed in the late tenth century, Sabuktigin&#x27;s state became a fully independent realm. Although not Iranian, the Ghaznavid rulers nevertheless claimed descent from the Sasanian ruler Yazdegerd III (c. 633–651).

Sabuktigin ruled with the title &quot;al-ḥājeb al-ajall&quot; (&quot;most noble commander&quot;). From 999 onwards, the Ghaznavids ruled with the title &quot;sulṭān&quot;. Sabuktigin&#x27;s capital, Ghazni, remained the Ghaznavid capital for the duration of their rule in Iran.

The Ghaznavids lost their territories in Iran to the Seljuks after the Battle of Dandanaqan (1040). For later Ghaznavid rulers, see Ghaznavids § List of rulers.

=== Turco-Mongol rule (1038–1508) ===

==== Seljuk Empire (1038–1194) ====
The Seljuk Empire was established by the Turkoman chieftain Tughril I, who invaded the Ghaznavids in the late 1030s. In 1040, the Seljuks conquered the Ghaznavid-held parts of Iran and over the following decades they established control over most of the Middle East, ending the Iranian Intermezzo. Though they were not of Iranian origin, the Seljuk rulers bolstered their legitimacy by claiming descent from Afrasiab, a legendary figure from the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;.&quot;&quot;

From the empire&#x27;s inception, the Seljuk rulers minted coins with the title &quot;šāhānšāh&quot; (&#x27;King of Kings&#x27;) in its Persian form, perhaps adopting it from the Buyids. Later on, the rulers more prominently used the Arabic title &quot;sulṭān&quot; and royal styles such as the Arabic &quot;malik&quot; and Persian &quot;šāh&quot; were bestowed on vassals. &quot;Šāhānšāh&quot; continued to be used on the majority of Seljuk coinage, sometimes in the new variant &quot;&quot;šāhānšāh&quot; king of Islam&quot;. Nishapur served as the first capital of the Seljuk Empire. In 1143, the capital was moved to Ray and a few years later it was moved again to Isfahan. From 1118 onwards, the Seljuk regime became increasingle unstable and rival claimants used various bases of power, including Baghdad, Hamadan, and Merv.
==== Khwarazmian Empire (1097–1220) ====
The Seljuk Empire fractured after the death of Ahmad Sanjar in 1157 and its vassals became effectively independent. One of these vassals was the Anushtegin dynasty, which ruled the Khwarazm region. The ruling dynasty were descendants of Anushtegin Gharchai, a former Turkic slave of the Seljuq sultans. In 1194, the Khwarazmian ruler Tekish conquered western Iran and Iraq from the remnants of the Seljuk Empire.

The Khwarazmian rulers used the ancient title &quot;xwârazmšāh&quot;, traditionally held by Iranian rulers of Khwarazm. Urganj was the Khwarazmian capital.

==== Mongol Empire (1220–1259) ====
The Mongol Empire was established by Genghis Khan in 1206 through uniting the Mongol clans. The unification of the clans was followed by aggressive imperial expansion throughout Asia and parts of Europe. In the early thirteenth century, the Mongols under reached Iran. The region around Bukhara was conquered in 1220 and the Khwarazmian Empire was destroyed. Over the following decades, further conquests followed in the Middle East, culminating in the fall of Baghdad and end of the Abbasid Caliphate&#x27;s rule there in 1258.

The rulers of the Mongol Empire used the ruling title &quot;khagan&quot; (&#x27;Great Khan&#x27; or &#x27;emperor&#x27;). In the 1230s, the Mongol Empire established its capital at Karakorum in Mongolia.
==== Ilkhanate (1256–1335) ====
After the death of Möngke Khan, the Mongol Empire was fractured by civil war, both over the succession of the next Great Khan and between nomadic traditionalists and the new settled princes of China and the Middle East. Kublai Khan (1260–1294) was eventually universally recognized but the empire was irreversibly fragmented. In much of the south-west of the empire (including Iran), power fell to Hulegu Khan, who had been made a deputy there under Möngke Khan. Hulegu was swiftly accepted as a legitimate ruler in Iran and was further legitimized through a &quot;fatwa&quot; issued by the Shiite scholar Ali ibn Tawus al-Hilli. Iran experienced a cultural renaissance under Ilkhanid rule. Ghazan Khan (1295–1304) converted to Islam in the late thirteenth century, turning the state further away from the other Mongol realms.

The rulers of the Ilkhanate adopted the style &quot;ilkhan&quot; (&quot;subordinate khan&quot;) to show deference to the Great Khan in China and Mongolia. From the time of Ghazan Khan onwards, they also used the title &quot;pādishāh-i Īrān&quot; (&quot;emperor of Iran&quot;), sometimes extended to &quot;pādishāh-i Īrān wa Islām&quot; (&quot;emperor of Iran and Islam&quot;). The version &quot;pādishāh-i Islām&quot; (&quot;emperor of Islam&quot;) is also recorded. The Ilkhanate went through a succession of capitals, beginning with Maragheh (1256–1265), Tabriz (1265–1306), and Soltaniyeh (1306–1335). After the empire disintegrated in the 1330s, various claimants established different centers of power. The last ilkhan, Luqman, ruled from Astarabad under Timurid suzerainty.
==== Timurid Empire (1370–1507) ====
The Timurid Empire was established by Timur, a conqueror who claimed both Turkic and Mongol descent. Timur began as a minor brigand chief under the Chagatai Khanate. In the middle 1360s, Timur rose to become the effective ruler of Transoxiana. He went on to establish his seat of power in Khorasan and conquered most of Iran through campaigns in the 1380s and 1390s.

During his conquests, Timur made some effort to portray himself as the heir of the Ilkhanate, adopting the Ilkhanid title &quot;pādishāh-i Islām&quot; (&quot;emperor of Islam&quot;). Timur also used the style &quot;guregen&quot; (&quot;son-in-law&quot;) to stress his marriage to Saray Mulk Khanum, a descendant of Genghis Khan. &quot;Pādishāh&quot; continued to be used by Timur&#x27;s successors, who at times also adopted the style of &quot;sulṭān&quot;. Samarkand was the capital of the Timurid Empire.

The Timurids lost almost all of their territories in Iran to the Qara Qoyunlu in 1452–1458. For later Timurid rulers in Khorasan and elsewhere, see Timurid Empire § Emperors (Emir).

==== Qara Qoyunlu (1452–1469) ====
The Qara Qoyunlu were a semi-nomadic Turkoman confederation that grew in power west of Iran following the collapse of the Ilkhanate. The origins of the Qara Qoyunlu are obscure and they are first recorded as an identifiable group in the 1330s. Under the leader Jahan Shah, the Qara Qoyunlu seized most of Iran from the Timurids. This began with the conquest of Jibal in 1452, and continued with further conquests of Isfahan, Fars, and Kerman in 1458.

The Qara Qoyunlu rulers presented themselves as rulers of Iran and political successors of the Ilkhanate, using titles such as &quot;pādishāh-i Īrān&quot; (&quot;emperor of Iran&quot;) and &quot;kesra-yi Īrān&quot; (&quot;Caesar of Iran&quot;). Tabriz served as the Qara Qoyunlu capital 1436–1467.

This list only includes the Qara Qoyunlu rulers who ruled Iran. For a full list, see the list of rulers of Qara Qoyunlu.
==== Aq Qoyunlu (1465–1508) ====
Like the Qara Qoyunlu, the Aq Qoyunlu were a semi-nomadic Turkoman confederation that rose to power after the Ilkhanate&#x27;s collapse. The Aq Qoyunlu was a more long-lived and better recorded group. In the 1450s and 1460s, the Aq Qoyunlu under Uzun Hasan defeated both the Qara Qoyunlu and Timurid forces and by 1469, Uzun Hasan ruled all of Iraq and Iran.

Like the preceding Qara Qoyunlu, the Aq Qoyunlu rulers titled themselves as &quot;pādishāh-i Īrān&quot; (&quot;emperor of Iran&quot;) and &quot;kesra-yi Īrān&quot; (&quot;Caesar of Iran&quot;), among other titles. Amida was the original Aq Qoyunlu capital. The capital was transferred to Tabriz under Uzun Hasan.

This list only includes the Aq Qoyunlu rulers who ruled Iran. For a full list, see the list of rulers of Aq Qoyunlu.

== Modern Iran (1501–1979) ==

=== Safavid Iran (1501–1722) ===

The Safavid dynasty originated as the leaders of the medieval mystic Safavid order. In 1499, the Safavid &quot;sheikh&quot; Ismail defeated the Shirvanshahs of Azerbaijan and began to wrest control of Iran from the Aq Qoyunlu. The power of the Aq Qoyunlu was decisively broken in 1501 with the defeat of Alvand Beg. In 1502, Ismail crowned himself &quot;šâhanšâh&quot; at Tabriz. The rise of the Safavids is often considered the beginning of modern Iranian history, with their state being the earliest stage of the modern Iranian nation state. Through further conquests, the Safavids restored Iran as a single Iranian political unit and retransformed the tribal nomadic order of the land, established during its period under Turko-Mongol rule, into a sedentary society. Shia Islam was for the first time established as the state religion.

The Safavids ruled as &quot;šâhanšâh-e Irân&quot; (&#x27;King of Kings of Iran&#x27;). The initial capital of the Safavid Empire was at Tabriz. Due to conflict with the Ottoman Empire in the west, the capital was moved eastwards to Qazvin in 1548, and then to Isfahan in the 1590s.
=== Intermediate period (1722–1796) ===
Complex rivalries in the region of Khorasan led to the Afghan Hotak dynasty invading Iran. In 1722, this conflict led to the collapse of the Safavid Empire after the siege of Isfahan. The brief interlude between 1722 and the rise of the Qajar dynasty in 1789–1796 was marked by widespread political turmoil in Iran and several rival attempts to establish power over the country. The Safavids failed to regain power and the Hotaks failed to establish control. The rival Afsharid and Zand dynasties were established by Nader Shah (1736–1747) and Karim Khan (1751–1779), respectively. Although both of these founding figures established their rule over large parts of the former Safavid domain, the political influence of their dynasties swiftly collapsed under their successors.

==== Hotaks (1722–1729) ====
In 1701, unrest among the Ghilji Pashtun tribe of Afghanistan led to a rebellion against the Safavids. This uprising was suppressed by the local commander, George XI of Kartli, but the Afghan anti-Safavid movement continued under Mirwais Hotak and his son, Mahmud Hotak. Mahmud initially feigned loyalty and was officially appointed as governor of Kandahar. In 1720, he began raiding the Kerman area and in March 1722, a hastily assembled Safavid army was defeated at the Battle of Gulnabad. Following a six-month siege of Isfahan, Soltan Hoseyn I formally submitted to Mahmud and recognized him as the new &quot;shah&quot; of Iran. The Hotak rulers of Iran ruled from the former Safavid capital of Isfahan.
==== Safavid dynasts (1722–1773) ====
When news of the fall of Isfahan reached Soltan Hoseyn I&#x27;s son Tahmasp II at Qazvin, Tahmasp proclaimed himself &quot;shah&quot;. Pro-Safavid forces successfully defeated Ashraf Hotak in 1729 and forced to Afghan forces out of Iran. Tahmasp failed to assert his authority in the aftermath of the Hotak invasion and the effective ruler of Iran was instead the general Nader Khan. In 1732, Nader deposed Tahmasp and replaced him with the eight-month old Abbas III. Abbas was in turn deposed in 1736 and Nader Khan was proclaimed the new &quot;shah&quot; of Iran under the name Nader Shah, terminating the Safavid dynasty. Safavid descendants continued to emerge for some time after 1736 as pretenders or as figurehead rulers put forward by warlords vying for power in Iran.

==== Afsharids (1736–1796) ====
The Afsharid dynasty was established by Nader Shah, a general under the Safavids who seized control of the empire in 1736 after the deposition of Abbas III. Nader was a powerful conqueror but the Afsharid Empire quickly collapsed after his assassination in 1747. Large territories fell to the rival Zand dynasty as well as the Afghan Durrani Empire. The domain of Nader&#x27;s heirs became largely confined to the Iranian parts of Khorasan. For most of its later history, the Afsharid state was dominated by military leaders or other court factions. The Afsharids ruled with the style of &quot;šâhanšâh&quot; and their capital was at Mashhad.
==== Zands (1751–1794) ====
In the aftermath of Nader Shah&#x27;s assassination, the Zand family grew to become the most powerful rivals of the Afsharids and seized control of much of Iran in the 1750s. Established by the tribal leader Karim Khan Zand, the Zand rulers never proclaimed themselves to be &quot;shah&quot;s.&#x27; Instead, they presented themselves as regents of Iran, at first on behalf of the Safavid puppet Ismail III (1750–1773) and then on behalf of the Iranian people.&#x27; Karim Khan Zand ruled with the title of &quot;khân&quot;, as well as the style of &quot;wakil&quot; (regent) or &quot;wakil-al-raʿāyāʾ&quot; (&quot;regent of the people&quot;).&#x27; His successors ruled simply as &quot;khân&quot;, though were often considered to be &quot;kings&quot; by European observers.&#x27; The Zand dynasty ruled from Shiraz.&quot;&quot;
=== Qajar Iran (1789–1925) ===
The Qajar dynasty originated as a local Turkoman noble family in northern Iran, under the Safavids. The Qajars gradually increased in power as other families fought each other in Iran, culminating in Agha Mohammad Shah proclaiming himself ruler in 1789, in opposition to the Afsharids and Zands. Agha Mohammad defeated the Zand dynasty in 1794 and was officially crowned in 1796. Shortly thereafter, he captured and deposed the Afsharid Shahrokh Shah, reunifying Iran under a single ruler.

Agha Mohammad Shah ruled with the title &quot;khân&quot; and later &quot;šâh&quot;, never assuming the more grandiose &quot;šâhanšâh&quot;. Agha Mohammad&#x27;s successor, Fath-Ali Shah, assumed both &quot;šâhanšâh&quot; and the Mongol &quot;khagan&quot;, titles frequently used by later Qajar rulers. Many other honorifics of imperial and religious significance were also used by the Qajar rulers. The Qajar dynasty ruled from Tehran, inaugurated as Iran&#x27;s capital in the 1780s under Agha Mohammad Shah.

=== Pahlavi Iran (1925–1979) ===
During the late Qajar dynasty, Iran became increasingly embroiled in internal political turmoil over the extent of the monarch&#x27;s power, among other events leading to the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1905–1911). In 1923, The brigade commander Reza Khan quickly rose through the ranks to become prime minister. In 1925, Reza succeeded in deposing Ahmad Shah and having himself proclaimed by Iran&#x27;s National Assembly first as regent and then as the new monarch. As his family name, Reza took &quot;Pahlavi&quot;, after the ancient Iranian script.

The Pahlavi rulers styled themselves as &quot;šâhanšâh-e Irân&quot; (&#x27;King of Kings of Iran&#x27;).&quot;&quot; Tehran remained the capital of Iran under Pahlavi rule.

<text>Henry John Heinz (October 11, 1844 – May 14, 1919) was an American entrepreneur who co-founded the H. J. Heinz Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

He was involved in the passage of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. Many of his descendants are known for philanthropy and involvement in politics and public affairs. His fortune became the basis for the Heinz Foundations.

==Early life==
Henry John Heinz was born in Birmingham, Pennsylvania to John Henry Heinz (1811–1891) and Anna Margaretha Schmidt (1822–1899). John Henry was born Johann Heinrich Heinz to parents Johann Georg and Charlotte Louisa (née Trump) Heinz in Kallstadt of the Palatinate, which at that time was part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. In 1840, John Henry emigrated to Birmingham, where he got a job making bricks and then met and married Anna in 1843, who herself had recently emigrated from (today a part of Haunetal), Hesse-Kassel. Then when Henry was five years old, his parents moved to Sharpsburg where Henry’s father went into the brick making business for himself. Anna Schmidt was the daughter of a farmer and church administrator, Johann Adam Schmidt, and his wife Dorothea (Thiel) Schmidt. Anna came from Hesse-Kassel, which was a Reformed Protestant (Calvinist) territory, so she was raised in the Calvinist Christian faith. Anna&#x27;s husband, John Heinz, was a Lutheran, and they raised and confirmed their son to that faith.

==H. J. Heinz Company==

Henry John Heinz began packing foodstuffs on a small scale at Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1869. There, he founded Heinz Noble &amp; Company with a friend, L. Clarence Noble, and started marketing bottled horseradish, soon followed by sauerkraut, vinegar, and pickles. The company became bankrupt in 1875. The following year, Heinz founded another company, F &amp; J Heinz, with his brother John Heinz and a cousin, Frederick Heinz.

The company continued to grow and, in 1888, Heinz bought out his other two partners and reorganized it as the H. J. Heinz Company, the name carried to the present day. The company&#x27;s slogan, &quot;57 varieties,&quot; was introduced by Heinz in 1896; by then, the company was selling more than 60 different products. Heinz said he chose &quot;5&quot; because it was his lucky number; the number &quot;7&quot; was his wife&#x27;s lucky number.

The H. J. Heinz Company was incorporated in 1905 with Heinz serving as its first president, retaining that position for the rest of his life. At the time of Heinz&#x27;s death in Pittsburgh at the age of 74, the H. J. Heinz Company had more than 20 food processing plants and owned seed farms and container factories.

==Later life==
Heinz led a successful lobbying effort in favor of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. During World War I, he worked with the Food Administration. He was a director in many financial institutions, and was chairman of a committee to devise ways of protecting Pittsburgh from floods.

===Marriage and family===
Heinz married Sarah Sloan Young on September 3, 1869. She was of Scots-Irish ancestry and had grown up in the Presbyterian Church. They had five children:
* Irene Edwilda Heinz-Given (1871–1956)
* Clarence Henry Heinz (1873–1920)
* Howard Covode Heinz (1877–1941)
* Robert Eugene Heinz (1882–1882, lived about 1 month)
* Clifford Sloan Heinz (1883–1935)
They were raised as Presbyterians.

===Religious faith===

Later in life Heinz worshipped as a member of Methodist and Presbyterian churches, and worked closely with Baptists as well.

When Heinz visited England, his &quot;tourist stops&quot; included the graves of religious leaders John Bunyan, Isaac Watts, and John Wesley. He visited a chapel that Wesley founded, later writing that &quot;I felt I was upon holy ground.&quot; At the beginning of his will Heinz wrote: &quot;I desire to set forth, at the very beginning of this Will, as the most important item in it, a confession of my faith in Jesus Christ as my Savior.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Heinz died at his home on May 14, 1919, after contracting pneumonia. His funeral was at East Liberty Presbyterian Church. He was buried at Homewood Cemetery in Pittsburgh, in the Heinz Family Mausoleum.

A bronze statue of Heinz by Emil Fuchs was dedicated on October 11, 1924, at the Heinz Company building in Pittsburgh.

Heinz is the grandfather of H. J. Heinz II (1908–1987) the great-grandfather of U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III (1938–1991) of Pennsylvania (who was later buried in the same family mausoleum), and great-great grandfather of Henry John Heinz IV, André Thierstein Heinz and Christopher Drake Heinz.

Through his paternal grandmother, Charlotte Louisa Trump, he was a second cousin of Friedrich Trump, second cousin (once removed) of real estate magnate Fred Trump, and second cousin (twice removed) of 45th &amp; 47th President of the United States, Donald Trump.

<text>The Kraft Heinz Foods Company, formerly the H. J. Heinz Company and commonly known as Heinz (), is an American food processing company headquartered at One PPG Place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The company was founded by Henry J. Heinz in 1869. Heinz manufactures food products in plants on six continents, and markets these products in more than 200 countries and territories. The company claims to have 150 number-one or number-two brands worldwide. Heinz ranked first in ketchup in the US with a market share in excess of 50%; the Ore-Ida label held 46% of the frozen potato sector in 2003.

Since 1896, the company used its &quot;57 Varieties&quot; slogan; it was inspired by a sign advertising 21 styles of shoes, and Henry Heinz chose the number 57 even though the company manufactured more than 60 products at the time, because &quot;5&quot; was his lucky number and &quot;7&quot; was his wife&#x27;s.

In February 2013, Heinz agreed to be purchased by Berkshire Hathaway and the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital for $23billion. On March 25, 2015, Kraft announced its merger with Heinz, arranged by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital. The resulting Kraft Heinz Company is the fifth largest food company in the world. Berkshire Hathaway became a majority owner of Heinz on June 18, 2015. After exercising a warrant to acquire 46 million shares of common stock for a total price of over $461million, Berkshire increased its stake to 52.5%. The merger to form Kraft Heinz was completed on July 2, 2015.

==History==

===Foundation===

Heinz was founded by and is named for Henry J. Heinz, who was born in the United States to German immigrants. His father was originally from Kallstadt (then part of the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate, now part of Rhineland-Palatinate). His mother Anna was from Haunetal, Hesse-Kassel, and they met in Pittsburgh.
Henry J. Heinz began packing foodstuffs on a small scale at Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1869. There he founded Heinz Noble &amp; Company with a friend, L. Clarence Noble, and began marketing horseradish. The first product in Heinz and Noble&#x27;s new Anchor Brand (a name selected for its biblical meaning of hope) was his mother Anna Heinz&#x27;s recipe for horseradish. The young Heinz manufactured it in the basement of his father&#x27;s former house.

The company went bankrupt in 1875. The following year Heinz founded another company, F &amp; J Heinz, with his brother John Heinz and a cousin, Frederick Heinz. One of this company&#x27;s first products was Heinz Tomato Ketchup. The company continued to grow.

In 1888, Heinz bought out his two partners and reorganized the company as the H. J. Heinz Company. Its slogan, &quot;57 varieties&quot;, was introduced by Heinz in 1896. Inspired by an advertisement he saw while riding an elevated train in New York City (a shoe store boasting &quot;21 styles&quot;), Heinz picked the number more or less at random because he liked the sound of it, selecting &quot;7&quot; specifically because, as he put it, of the &quot;psychological influence of that figure and of its enduring significance to people of all ages&quot;.

===20th century===
The H. J. Heinz Company was incorporated in Pennsylvania on July 27, 1900; Heinz served as its first president, holding that position for the rest of his life. Under his leadership, the company pioneered processes for sanitary food preparation, and led a successful lobbying effort in favor of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. In 1908 he established a processing plant in Leamington, Ontario, Canada for tomatoes and other products. Heinz operated it until 2014, when it was sold.

Heinz was a pioneer in both scientific and &quot;technological innovations to solve problems like bacterial contamination&quot;. He personally worked to control the &quot;purity of his products by managing his employees&quot;, offering hot showers and weekly manicures for the women handling food. During World War I, he worked with the Food Administration.

In 1914, Heinz Salad Cream was invented in England.

In 1930, Howard Heinz, son of Henry Heinz, helped to fight the downturn of the Great Depression by selling ready-to-serve soups and baby food. They became top sellers.

The Pittsburgh plant included a large &quot;Heinz service building&quot;, which included three dining rooms and a 3,000-seat auditorium. The auditorium included a pipe organ, and Heinz employed an organist to give recitals and musical programs. The original organ was severely damaged in the 1936 Pittsburgh floods, it was replaced with a new Kimball organ that had four manuals and 57 sets of pipes. The original organ was restored and installed in Grace Methodist Church in Sharpsburg.

During World War II, &quot;Jack&quot; Heinz led the company as president and CEO to aid the United Kingdom and offset food shortages. Its plant in Pittsburgh was converted for a time to manufacture gliders for the War Department.

In the postwar years, Jack Heinz expanded the company to develop plants in several nations overseas, greatly expanding its international presence. He also acquired Ore-Ida and Starkist Tuna.

In 1959, long-time Heinz employee Frank Armour Jr. was elected president and COO of H. J. Heinz Co., succeeding H. J. Heinz II. He was the first non-family member to hold the job since the company started in 1869. He became vice chairman in 1966, and later became chairman and CEO of Heinz subsidiary, Ore-Ida Foods Inc.

In 1969, Tony O&#x27;Reilly joined the company&#x27;s UK subsidiary, soon becoming its managing director. He moved to Pittsburgh in 1971 when he was promoted to senior vice president for the North America and Pacific region. By 1973, Heinz selected him as president. He became CEO in 1979 and chairman in 1987.
Between 1981 and 1991, Heinz returned 28% annually, doubling the Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s average annual return for those years. By 2000, the consolidation of grocery store chains, the spread of retailers such as Walmart, and growth of private-label brands caused competition for shelf space, and put price pressure on the company&#x27;s products. The decline was also attributed to an inadequate response to broad demographic changes in the United States, particularly the growth in population among Hispanic and increased spending power of African Americans.

In 1998, Tony O&#x27;Reilly left Heinz after issues with the company&#x27;s performance. He faced challenges from corporate governance groups and pension funds including CalPERS. He was succeeded by his deputy, William R. Johnson.

===21st century===
In 2001, Heinz acquired the pasta sauce, dry bouillon and soup business of Borden Foods. CEO William R. Johnson stated that &quot;They fit very well with our tomato-based expertise&quot;.

On August 22, 2001, Heinz announced that it would acquire the Anchor Food Products&#x27; branded products, which included the Poppers line of appetizers, as well as the licensing rights to the TGI Fridays brand of frozen foods and appetizers. The acquisition was completed on September 25.

Billionaire Nelson Peltz initiated a proxy battle during 2006, culminating in a vote to place five of Peltz&#x27;s nominees on the Board. After the final vote, two of the five nominees joined the Heinz Board. The new members of the board were Nelson Peltz and Matthew Craig Walsh.

In 2002, Heinz announced that it had sold the StarKist and 9Lives brands to Del Monte Foods.

In June 2008, Heinz began an advertising campaign in the UK for their new &quot;New York Deli Mayo&quot; products. The advertisement featured two men kissing in a family setting, which drew 200 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority. On June 24, 2008, Heinz withdrew the advertisement, which had been planned for a five-week run. The company said that some of its customers had expressed concerns. Withdrawing the advert was also controversial, with critics accusing Heinz of homophobia. The gay rights group Stonewall called for a boycott of Heinz products. Some expressed surprise that it had responded to what they said was a relatively small number of complaints, compared to the UK&#x27;s estimated 3.6 million gay and lesbian consumers. MP Diane Abbott called the decision to withdraw the advert &quot;ill-considered&quot; and &quot;likely to offend the gay community&quot;.

On February 14, 2013, it was announced that Heinz would be purchased by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital for $23billion. Including debt assumption the transaction was valued at $28billion. According to Heinz, the deal was the largest in food industry history. Berkshire Hathaway and 3G would each own half of Heinz, with 3G running the company. Berkshire and 3G paid $72.50 a share. The acquisition was completed in June of that year. Berkshire and 3G immediately named Bernardo Hees, former chief executive of Burger King Worldwide Inc, as the CEO.

On August 13, 2013, Heinz announced it was cutting 600 jobs in North America.
On October 25, 2013, fast-food chain McDonald&#x27;s announced it would end its 40-year relationship with Heinz, after the former Burger King, McDonald&#x27;s competitor, chief Hees became CEO of Heinz.

On March 25, 2015, Kraft Foods Group Inc. announced that it would merge with the H. J. Heinz Company, owned by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to form the world&#x27;s fifth-largest food and beverage company. The companies completed the merger on July 2, 2015, with the latter changing its name to the Kraft Heinz Foods Company.

In 2024, Carlos Abrams-Rivera took over as CEO of Kraft Heinz Co.

==International presence==

===United States===
The company&#x27;s world headquarters were in Chicago, Illinois, with the H. J. Heinz division located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where the company was founded. The company&#x27;s &quot;keystone&quot; logo was based on that of Pennsylvania, the &quot;keystone state&quot;. Heinz Field was named after the Heinz company in 2001.

A majority of its ketchup was produced in Fremont, Ohio, and the rest made in Muscatine, Iowa.

Heinz opened a pickle factory in Holland, Michigan, in 1897, and it is the largest such facility in the world. The Heinz Portion Control subsidiary is located in Jacksonville, Florida, and produces single-serving containers of ketchup, mustard, salad dressings, jams, jellies and syrups.

Heinz also had factories in the following locations: Arizona (Phoenix); California (Chatsworth, Escalon, Irvine, San Diego); Florida (Fort Myers); Idaho (Pocatello); Iowa (Cedar Rapids, Muscatine); Massachusetts (Newburyport); Ohio (Mason, Massillon); Oregon (Ontario), and South Carolina (Florence).

In 2000, seven retailers, including Walmart, Albertsons, and Safeway, comprised half of the company&#x27;s sales by volume.

===Australia===
Heinz Australia&#x27;s head office is located in Melbourne. Products include canned baked beans in tomato sauce (popularized in the &quot;beanz meanz Heinz&quot; advertising campaign), spaghetti in a similar sauce, and canned soup, condensed soup, and &quot;ready to eat&quot; soups.

Heinz manufactures &quot;Big Red&quot; tomato sauce, and a number of flavored baked bean varieties, as well as canned meals. Heinz also markets the Wattie&#x27;s brand of canned foods, which are made in New Zealand.

On October 6, 2008, Heinz announced plans to acquire the Australian company Golden Circle which &quot;manufactures more than 500 products, including canned fruit and vegetables, fruit juices, drinks, cordials and jams&quot;.

On May 27, 2011, Heinz announced it would close its factory in Girgarre, Victoria, and downsize its factories in Northgate (Brisbane), and Wagga Wagga, with loss of more than 300 jobs. Heinz has other factories in Echuca and Mill Park.

On January 6, 2012, Heinz closed its tomato sauce factory in Girgarre as announced in the previous May. 146 workers lost their jobs. A local group was seeking to purchase the factory and start its own production, with offers of financial assistance from investors. The group&#x27;s first offer for the site was rejected by Heinz. Girgarre was the second to last tomato sauce factory in Australia, and its closing brought an end to Heinz&#x27;s 70 years of tomato processing operations in Australia.

As of May 2020 Kraft Heinz is said to potentially be in discussions with Graeme Hart to sell off the brands of Wattie&#x27;s in New Zealand and Golden Circle in Australia.

===Canada===
Heinz was established in Canada in 1908 in a former tobacco factory in Leamington, Ontario (known as the Tomato Capital of Canada). Most products shipped from Leamington have bilingual English and French labels for distribution throughout Canada, but a substantial amount of product is sent from there to the US. Ketchup is the main product produced there, and the city has been a center of tomato production. The factory also produces Canada Fancy (Grade A) tomato juice, mustard, vinegar, baby food, barbecue sauces, canned pastas, beans, pasta sauces, gravies and soups. Heinz Canada is the major supplier of single-serving and flexible-packaging condiments for most fast food chains in Canada. Leamington is the largest tomato-processing region per acreage in the world. The Leamington plant usually processes more than 250,000 tons of tomatoes per year. Heinz Canada&#x27;s head office is in North York, Ontario; it also has operations in St. Marys, Ontario; Montreal, Quebec; and Calgary, Alberta.

On November 14, 2013, Heinz announced that the Leamington facility, the second-largest in the company, would close sometime in May 2014. Ketchup processing operations were to be consolidated at the company&#x27;s US locations. Over 800 local jobs were lost due to the town&#x27;s largest employer ending operations there. A local effort began in an attempt to save the 105-year-old Leamington plant, and it included creating a Facebook page to gather support. On February 27, 2014, the Highbury Canco Corporation signed a letter of intent to acquire and operate the facility. In April it was reported that Highbury Canco Corporation had received a one-year license to process tomatoes at the facility, saving some 250 jobs.

As a result of this corporate restructuring and the angry Canadian response, a rival food company, French&#x27;s, began producing their own ketchup brand using Leamington produce. It marketed the brand with an appeal to Canadian patriotism. This successful campaign, combined with a Canadian grassroots effort on Facebook encouraging purchasing of the French&#x27;s product, resulted in Heinz&#x27;s market share in Canada dropping from 84 to 76%, a significant shift in a mature market. This undesirable development was exacerbated in 2018 when Canadian tariffs were erected against specific American exports, which includes ketchup produced in the United States, in retaliation to the US President Trump&#x27;s tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum exports. Heinz conducted a belated public relations campaign in Canada to try to counter the public anger against them, a task made more difficult by public sentiment rising to encourage a boycott of American goods in reaction of US President Trump&#x27;s rhetoric against Canada.

===India===
Heinz Ketchup is available in India in two varieties, the standard Tomato Ketchup and Tomato Chili Sauce. As Indian taste preferences vary among the regions, Western brands such as Heinz must work on Indian interpretations of ketchups for sale in the country. Heinz acquired the former foods division of Glaxo India, gaining the Complan, Glucon D, Glucon C, Sampriti Ghee, and Nycil products and brands. In 2019, Heinz sold a portion of the business, including Complan and Glucon-D, for $627.18 million to Zydus Wellness.

===Indonesia===
H. J. Heinz Company entered Indonesia in 1999, when it acquired 65 percent share of PT. ABC Central Food, for US$70 million, and formed PT. Heinz ABC Indonesia. The company is based in Jakarta, and manufactures sauces, condiments, juices and syrups.

Serving demand from Indonesia&#x27;s large population and growing economy, in the early 21st century PT. Heinz ABC Indonesia is the largest Heinz&#x27;s business in Asia, and one of the largest in the world. It employs 3000 employees, has 3 production facilities, 8 packing facilities, and an extensive distribution network in Java and other parts of Indonesia. Their leading products are Syrup ABC (fruit syrup), Kecap ABC (sweet soy sauce), and Sambal ABC (hot chili sauce).

===Netherlands===

Heinz sells many products in the Netherlands; the Elst factory in Gelderland is the primary production facility for Heinz sauces for Western Europe. In 2006, production of both HP Sauce and Daddies was transferred from Birmingham, West Midlands to Elst as a result of the acquisition of HP Foods and the subsequent closure of the Aston factory. Subsequently, Heinz suffered severe supply issues for the ex-HP Foods brands as the Elst factory struggled to integrate production, resulting in significant negative coverage from UK retailers. Heinz was forced to begin bottling sauce in Spain, shipping ready-made sauce from Elst, to get product back into supply. Netherlands factories are also responsible for producing signature sauces such as mayonnaise and ketchup for its Southeast Asian market.

===United Kingdom===
After opening its first overseas office in London in 1896, the company opened its first UK factory in Peckham, south London in 1905. This was followed by a factory at Harlesden, north-west London in 1919. Bombed twice in World War II, this factory remained in production until 2000. Production was started at a former munitions factory at Standish near Wigan in 1946, before the new factory at Kitt Green, near Wigan, opened in 1959. Heinz also had an infant food factory in Kendal, Cumbria. The site specialized in baby milks, previously under the brand of Farley&#x27;s, but then manufactured under the name Heinz Nurture.

Heinz produces oriental foods sold under the Amoy brand, once used under license from Ajinomoto Co. Inc., Tokyo, Japan. In 2018, Amoy Food was sold to the new owners, CITIC Capital Asian Foods Holdings Ltd.

In July 2001, the Food Standards Agency of the Government of the United Kingdom found Heinz canned baked beans products to be contaminated with the hormone disruptor bisphenol.

In 2013, the Kitt Green facility was listed as one among the world&#x27;s five largest manufacturing units by the Discovery Channel (the list comprised Reliance&#x27;s Jamnagar Refinery, Volkswagen&#x27;s car plant, Kitt Green Foods plant, NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center and POSCO&#x27;s steel plant). It was Europe&#x27;s largest food factory and supplied more than 1 billion cans every year.

===China===
On February 22, 2013, Sanquan Food, a Chinese frozen food company, signed a contract to purchase LongFong Food, a subsidiary of Heinz Company in China. With this sale, Heinz (China) will focus on infant foods and sauces in emerging markets such as China. Heinz Hong Kong Limited is the regional office serving for operations in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan.

===New Zealand===
Heinz produces frozen vegetables for export for the New Zealand and Australian market. They also produce mayonnaise and other sauces for the New Zealand and Australian market. Most products sold in New Zealand are sold under the brand name &quot;Watties&quot;.

<doc id="13883" wikidata="Q2647" url="?curid=13883" title="Huffman coding">
<text>In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code is Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper &quot;A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes&quot;.

The output from Huffman&#x27;s algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (&quot;weight&quot;) for each possible value of the source symbol. As in other entropy encoding methods, more common symbols are generally represented using fewer bits than less common symbols. Huffman&#x27;s method can be efficiently implemented, finding a code in time linear to the number of input weights if these weights are sorted. However, although optimal among methods encoding symbols separately, Huffman coding is not always optimal among all compression methods – it is replaced with arithmetic coding or asymmetric numeral systems if a better compression ratio is required.

== History ==

In 1951, David A. Huffman and his MIT information theory classmates were given the choice of a term paper or a final exam. The professor, Robert M. Fano, assigned a term paper on the problem of finding the most efficient binary code. Huffman, unable to prove any codes were the most efficient, was about to give up and start studying for the final when he hit upon the idea of using a frequency-sorted binary tree and quickly proved this method the most efficient.

In doing so, Huffman outdid Fano, who had worked with Claude Shannon to develop a similar code. Building the tree from the bottom up guaranteed optimality, unlike the top-down approach of Shannon–Fano coding.

== Terminology ==

Huffman coding uses a specific method for choosing the representation for each symbol, resulting in a prefix code (sometimes called &quot;prefix-free codes&quot;, that is, the bit string representing some particular symbol is never a prefix of the bit string representing any other symbol). Huffman coding is such a widespread method for creating prefix codes that the term &quot;Huffman code&quot; is widely used as a synonym for &quot;prefix code&quot; even when such a code is not produced by Huffman&#x27;s algorithm.

== Problem definition ==

=== Informal description ===
;Given: A set of symbols formula_1 and for each symbol formula_2, the frequency formula_3 representing the fraction of symbols in the text that are equal to formula_4.
;Find: A prefix-free binary code (a set of codewords) with minimum expected codeword length (equivalently, a tree with minimum weighted path length from the root).

=== Formalized description ===
Input.
Alphabet formula_5, which is the symbol alphabet of size formula_6. 
Tuple formula_7, which is the tuple of the (positive) symbol weights (usually proportional to probabilities), i.e. formula_8. 

Output.
Code formula_9, which is the tuple of (binary) codewords, where formula_10 is the codeword for formula_11.

Goal.
Let formula_12 be the weighted path length of code formula_13. Condition: formula_14 for any code formula_15.

=== Example ===

We give an example of the result of Huffman coding for a code with five characters and given weights. We will not verify that it minimizes &quot;L&quot; over all codes, but we will compute &quot;L&quot; and compare it to the Shannon entropy &quot;H&quot; of the given set of weights; the result is nearly optimal.

For any code that is &quot;biunique&quot;, meaning that the code is &quot;uniquely decodeable&quot;, the sum of the probability budgets across all symbols is always less than or equal to one. In this example, the sum is strictly equal to one; as a result, the code is termed a &quot;complete&quot; code. If this is not the case, one can always derive an equivalent code by adding extra symbols (with associated null probabilities), to make the code complete while keeping it &quot;biunique&quot;.

As defined by Shannon (1948), the information content &quot;h&quot; (in bits) of each symbol &quot;a&quot;i with non-null probability is

:formula_16

The entropy &quot;H&quot; (in bits) is the weighted sum, across all symbols with non-zero probability , of the information content of each symbol:

:formula_17

(Note: A symbol with zero probability has zero contribution to the entropy, since formula_18. So for simplicity, symbols with zero probability can be left out of the formula above.)

As a consequence of Shannon&#x27;s source coding theorem, the entropy is a measure of the smallest codeword length that is theoretically possible for the given alphabet with associated weights. In this example, the weighted average codeword length is 2.25 bits per symbol, only slightly larger than the calculated entropy of 2.205 bits per symbol. So not only is this code optimal in the sense that no other feasible code performs better, but it is very close to the theoretical limit established by Shannon.

In general, a Huffman code need not be unique. Thus the set of Huffman codes for a given probability distribution is a non-empty subset of the codes minimizing formula_19 for that probability distribution. (However, for each minimizing codeword length assignment, there exists at least one Huffman code with those lengths.)

== Basic technique ==

===Compression===


The technique works by creating a binary tree of nodes. These can be stored in a regular array, the size of which depends on the number of symbols, formula_6. A node can be either a leaf node or an internal node. Initially, all nodes are leaf nodes, which contain the symbol itself, the weight (frequency of appearance) of the symbol and optionally, a link to a parent node which makes it easy to read the code (in reverse) starting from a leaf node. Internal nodes contain a weight, links to two child nodes and an optional link to a parent node. As a common convention, bit &#x27;0&#x27; represents following the left child and bit &#x27;1&#x27; represents following the right child. A finished tree has up to formula_6 leaf nodes and formula_22 internal nodes. A Huffman tree that omits unused symbols produces the most optimal code lengths.

The process begins with the leaf nodes containing the probabilities of the symbol they represent. Then, the process takes the two nodes with smallest probability, and creates a new internal node having these two nodes as children. The weight of the new node is set to the sum of the weight of the children. We then apply the process again, on the new internal node and on the remaining nodes (i.e., we exclude the two leaf nodes), we repeat this process until only one node remains, which is the root of the Huffman tree.

The simplest construction algorithm uses a priority queue where the node with lowest probability is given highest priority:

# Create a leaf node for each symbol and add it to the priority queue.
# While there is more than one node in the queue:
## Remove the two nodes of highest priority (lowest probability) from the queue
## Create a new internal node with these two nodes as children and with probability equal to the sum of the two nodes&#x27; probabilities.
## Add the new node to the queue.
# The remaining node is the root node and the tree is complete.

Since efficient priority queue data structures require O(log &quot;n&quot;) time per insertion, and a tree with &quot;n&quot; leaves has 2&quot;n&quot;−1 nodes, this algorithm operates in O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) time, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of symbols.

If the symbols are sorted by probability, there is a linear-time (O(&quot;n&quot;)) method to create a Huffman tree using two queues, the first one containing the initial weights (along with pointers to the associated leaves), and combined weights (along with pointers to the trees) being put in the back of the second queue. This assures that the lowest weight is always kept at the front of one of the two queues:

#Start with as many leaves as there are symbols.
#Enqueue all leaf nodes into the first queue (by probability in increasing order so that the least likely item is in the head of the queue).
#While there is more than one node in the queues:
##Dequeue the two nodes with the lowest weight by examining the fronts of both queues.
##Create a new internal node, with the two just-removed nodes as children (either node can be either child) and the sum of their weights as the new weight.
##Enqueue the new node into the rear of the second queue.
#The remaining node is the root node; the tree has now been generated.

Once the Huffman tree has been generated, it is traversed to generate a dictionary which maps the symbols to binary codes as follows:

#Start with current node set to the root.
#If node is not a leaf node, label the edge to the left child as 0 and the edge to the right child as 1. Repeat the process at both the left child and the right child.

The final encoding of any symbol is then read by a concatenation of the labels on the edges along the path from the root node to the symbol.

In many cases, time complexity is not very important in the choice of algorithm here, since &quot;n&quot; here is the number of symbols in the alphabet, which is typically a very small number (compared to the length of the message to be encoded); whereas complexity analysis concerns the behavior when &quot;n&quot; grows to be very large.

It is generally beneficial to minimize the variance of codeword length. For example, a communication buffer receiving Huffman-encoded data may need to be larger to deal with especially long symbols if the tree is especially unbalanced. To minimize variance, simply break ties between queues by choosing the item in the first queue. This modification will retain the mathematical optimality of the Huffman coding while both minimizing variance and minimizing the length of the longest character code.
===Decompression===
Generally speaking, the process of decompression is simply a matter of translating the stream of prefix codes to individual byte values, usually by traversing the Huffman tree node by node as each bit is read from the input stream (reaching a leaf node necessarily terminates the search for that particular byte value). Before this can take place, however, the Huffman tree must be somehow reconstructed. In the simplest case, where character frequencies are fairly predictable, the tree can be preconstructed (and even statistically adjusted on each compression cycle) and thus reused every time, at the expense of at least some measure of compression efficiency. Otherwise, the information to reconstruct the tree must be sent a priori. A naive approach might be to prepend the frequency count of each character to the compression stream. Unfortunately, the overhead in such a case could amount to several kilobytes, so this method has little practical use. If the data is compressed using canonical encoding, the compression model can be precisely reconstructed with just formula_23 bits of information (where is the number of bits per symbol). Another method is to simply prepend the Huffman tree, bit by bit, to the output stream. For example, assuming that the value of 0 represents a parent node and 1 a leaf node, whenever the latter is encountered the tree building routine simply reads the next 8 bits to determine the character value of that particular leaf. The process continues recursively until the last leaf node is reached; at that point, the Huffman tree will thus be faithfully reconstructed. The overhead using such a method ranges from roughly 2 to 320 bytes (assuming an 8-bit alphabet). Many other techniques are possible as well. In any case, since the compressed data can include unused &quot;trailing bits&quot; the decompressor must be able to determine when to stop producing output. This can be accomplished by either transmitting the length of the decompressed data along with the compression model or by defining a special code symbol to signify the end of input (the latter method can adversely affect code length optimality, however).

== Main properties ==
The probabilities used can be generic ones for the application domain that are based on average experience, or they can be the actual frequencies found in the text being compressed.
This requires that a frequency table must be stored with the compressed text. See the Decompression section above for more information about the various techniques employed for this purpose.

=== Optimality ===
Huffman&#x27;s original algorithm is optimal for a symbol-by-symbol coding with a known input probability distribution, i.e., separately encoding unrelated symbols in such a data stream. However, it is not optimal when the symbol-by-symbol restriction is dropped, or when the probability mass functions are unknown. Also, if symbols are not independent and identically distributed, a single code may be insufficient for optimality. Other methods such as arithmetic coding often have better compression capability.

Although both aforementioned methods can combine an arbitrary number of symbols for more efficient coding and generally adapt to the actual input statistics, arithmetic coding does so without significantly increasing its computational or algorithmic complexities (though the simplest version is slower and more complex than Huffman coding). Such flexibility is especially useful when input probabilities are not precisely known or vary significantly within the stream. However, Huffman coding is usually faster and arithmetic coding was historically a subject of some concern over patent issues. Thus many technologies have historically avoided arithmetic coding in favor of Huffman and other prefix coding techniques. As of mid-2010, the most commonly used techniques for this alternative to Huffman coding have passed into the public domain as the early patents have expired.

For a set of symbols with a uniform probability distribution and a number of members which is a power of two, Huffman coding is equivalent to simple binary block encoding, e.g., ASCII coding. This reflects the fact that compression is not possible with such an input, no matter what the compression method, i.e., doing nothing to the data is the optimal thing to do.

Huffman coding is optimal among all methods in any case where each input symbol is a known independent and identically distributed random variable having a probability that is dyadic. Prefix codes, and thus Huffman coding in particular, tend to have inefficiency on small alphabets, where probabilities often fall between these optimal (dyadic) points. The worst case for Huffman coding can happen when the probability of the most likely symbol far exceeds 2−1 = 0.5, making the upper limit of inefficiency unbounded.

There are two related approaches for getting around this particular inefficiency while still using Huffman coding. Combining a fixed number of symbols together (&quot;blocking&quot;) often increases (and never decreases) compression. As the size of the block approaches infinity, Huffman coding theoretically approaches the entropy limit, i.e., optimal compression. However, blocking arbitrarily large groups of symbols is impractical, as the complexity of a Huffman code is linear in the number of possibilities to be encoded, a number that is exponential in the size of a block. This limits the amount of blocking that is done in practice.

A practical alternative, in widespread use, is run-length encoding. This technique adds one step in advance of entropy coding, specifically counting (runs) of repeated symbols, which are then encoded. For the simple case of Bernoulli processes, Golomb coding is optimal among prefix codes for coding run length, a fact proved via the techniques of Huffman coding. A similar approach is taken by fax machines using modified Huffman coding. However, run-length coding is not as adaptable to as many input types as other compression technologies.

== Variations ==
Many variations of Huffman coding exist, some of which use a Huffman-like algorithm, and others of which find optimal prefix codes (while, for example, putting different restrictions on the output). Note that, in the latter case, the method need not be Huffman-like, and, indeed, need not even be polynomial time.

=== &quot;n&quot;-ary Huffman coding ===
The &quot;n&quot;-ary Huffman algorithm uses the {0, 1..., &quot;n&quot; − 1} alphabet to encode message and build an &quot;n&quot;-ary tree. This approach was considered by Huffman in his original paper. The same algorithm applies as for binary (formula_24) codes, except that the &quot;n&quot; least probable symbols are taken together, instead of just the 2 least probable. Note that for &quot;n&quot; greater than 2, not all sets of source words can properly form an &quot;n&quot;-ary tree for Huffman coding. In these cases, additional 0-probability place holders must be added. This is because the tree must form an &quot;n&quot; to 1 contractor; for binary coding, this is a 2 to 1 contractor, and any sized set can form such a contractor. If the number of source words is congruent to 1 modulo &quot;n&quot; − 1, then the set of source words will form a proper Huffman tree.

=== Adaptive Huffman coding ===
A variation called adaptive Huffman coding involves calculating the probabilities dynamically based on recent actual frequencies in the sequence of source symbols, and changing the coding tree structure to match the updated probability estimates. It is used rarely in practice, since the cost of updating the tree makes it slower than optimized adaptive arithmetic coding, which is more flexible and has better compression.

=== Huffman template algorithm ===
Most often, the weights used in implementations of Huffman coding represent numeric probabilities, but the algorithm given above does not require this; it requires only that the weights form a totally ordered commutative monoid, meaning a way to order weights and to add them. The Huffman template algorithm enables one to use any kind of weights (costs, frequencies, pairs of weights, non-numerical weights) and one of many combining methods (not just addition). Such algorithms can solve other minimization problems, such as minimizing formula_25, a problem first applied to circuit design.

=== Length-limited Huffman coding/minimum variance Huffman coding ===
Length-limited Huffman coding is a variant where the goal is still to achieve a minimum weighted path length, but there is an additional restriction that the length of each codeword must be less than a given constant. The package-merge algorithm solves this problem with a simple greedy approach very similar to that used by Huffman&#x27;s algorithm. Its time complexity is formula_26, where formula_27 is the maximum length of a codeword. No algorithm is known to solve this problem in formula_28 or formula_29 time, unlike the presorted and unsorted conventional Huffman problems, respectively.

=== Huffman coding with unequal letter costs ===
In the standard Huffman coding problem, it is assumed that each symbol in the set that the code words are constructed from has an equal cost to transmit: a code word whose length is &quot;N&quot; digits will always have a cost of &quot;N&quot;, no matter how many of those digits are 0s, how many are 1s, etc. When working under this assumption, minimizing the total cost of the message and minimizing the total number of digits are the same thing.

&quot;Huffman coding with unequal letter costs&quot; is the generalization without this assumption: the letters of the encoding alphabet may have non-uniform lengths, due to characteristics of the transmission medium. An example is the encoding alphabet of Morse code, where a &#x27;dash&#x27; takes longer to send than a &#x27;dot&#x27;, and therefore the cost of a dash in transmission time is higher. The goal is still to minimize the weighted average codeword length, but it is no longer sufficient just to minimize the number of symbols used by the message. No algorithm is known to solve this in the same manner or with the same efficiency as conventional Huffman coding, though it has been solved by Richard M. Karp whose solution has been refined for the case of integer costs by Mordecai J. Golin.

=== Optimal alphabetic binary trees (Hu–Tucker coding) ===
In the standard Huffman coding problem, it is assumed that any codeword can correspond to any input symbol. In the alphabetic version, the alphabetic order of inputs and outputs must be identical. Thus, for example, formula_30 could not be assigned code formula_31, but instead should be assigned either formula_32 or formula_33. This is also known as the Hu–Tucker problem, after T. C. Hu and Alan Tucker, the authors of the paper presenting the first formula_29-time solution to this optimal binary alphabetic problem, which has some similarities to Huffman algorithm, but is not a variation of this algorithm. A later method, the Garsia–Wachs algorithm of Adriano Garsia and Michelle L. Wachs (1977), uses simpler logic to perform the same comparisons in the same total time bound. These optimal alphabetic binary trees are often used as binary search trees.

=== The canonical Huffman code ===

If weights corresponding to the alphabetically ordered inputs are in numerical order, the Huffman code has the same lengths as the optimal alphabetic code, which can be found from calculating these lengths, rendering Hu–Tucker coding unnecessary. The code resulting from numerically (re-)ordered input is sometimes called the &quot;canonical Huffman code&quot; and is often the code used in practice, due to ease of encoding/decoding. The technique for finding this code is sometimes called Huffman–Shannon–Fano coding, since it is optimal like Huffman coding, but alphabetic in weight probability, like Shannon–Fano coding. The Huffman–Shannon–Fano code corresponding to the example is formula_35, which, having the same codeword lengths as the original solution, is also optimal. But in &quot;canonical Huffman code&quot;, the result is formula_36.

== Applications ==
Arithmetic coding and Huffman coding produce equivalent results — achieving entropy — when every symbol has a probability of the form 1/2&quot;k&quot;. In other circumstances, arithmetic coding can offer better compression than Huffman coding because — intuitively — its &quot;code words&quot; can have effectively non-integer bit lengths, whereas code words in prefix codes such as Huffman codes can only have an integer number of bits. Therefore, a code word of length &quot;k&quot; only optimally matches a symbol of probability 1/2&quot;k&quot; and other probabilities are not represented optimally; whereas the code word length in arithmetic coding can be made to exactly match the true probability of the symbol. This difference is especially striking for small alphabet sizes.

Prefix codes nevertheless remain in wide use because of their simplicity, high speed, and lack of patent coverage. They are often used as a &quot;back-end&quot; to other compression methods. Deflate (PKZIP&#x27;s algorithm) and multimedia codecs such as JPEG and MP3 have a front-end model and quantization followed by the use of prefix codes; these are often called &quot;Huffman codes&quot; even though most applications use pre-defined variable-length codes rather than codes designed using Huffman&#x27;s algorithm.

<doc id="13885" wikidata="Q410020" url="?curid=13885" title="High-density lipoprotein">
<text>High-density lipoprotein(HDL) is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are complex particles composed of multiple proteins which transport all fat molecules (lipids) around the body within the water outside cells. They are typically composed of 80–100 proteins per particle (organized by one, two or three ApoA). HDL particles enlarge while circulating in the blood, aggregating more fat molecules and transporting up to hundreds of fat molecules per particle.

==Overview==
Lipoproteins are divided into five subgroups, by density/size (an inverse relationship), which also correlates with function and incidence of cardiovascular events. Unlike the larger lipoprotein particles, which deliver fat molecules to cells, HDL particles remove fat molecules from cells. The lipids carried include cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides, amounts of each are variable.

Increasing concentrations of HDL particles are associated with decreasing accumulation of atherosclerosis within the walls of arteries, reducing the risk of sudden plaque ruptures, cardiovascular disease, stroke and other vascular diseases. HDL particles are commonly referred to as &quot;good cholesterol&quot;, because they transport fat molecules out of artery walls, reduce macrophage accumulation, and thus help prevent or even regress atherosclerosis. Higher HDL-C may not necessarily be protective against cardiovascular disease and may even be harmful in extremely high quantities, with an increased cardiovascular risk, especially in hypertensive patients.

== Testing ==
Because of the high cost of directly measuring HDL and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) protein particles, blood tests are commonly performed for the surrogate value, HDL-C, i.e. the cholesterol associated with ApoA-1/HDL particles. In healthy individuals, about 30% of blood cholesterol, along with other fats, is carried by HDL. This is often contrasted with the amount of cholesterol estimated to be carried within low-density lipoprotein particles, LDL, and called LDL-C. HDL particles remove fats and cholesterol from cells, including within artery wall atheroma, and transport it back to the liver for excretion or re-utilization; thus the cholesterol carried within HDL particles (HDL-C) is sometimes called &quot;good cholesterol&quot; (despite being the same as cholesterol in LDL particles). Those with higher levels of HDL-C tend to have fewer problems with cardiovascular diseases, while those with low HDL-C cholesterol levels (especially less than 40 mg/dL or about 1 mmol/L) have increased rates for heart disease. Higher native HDL levels are correlated with lowered risk of cardiovascular disease in healthy people.

The remainder of the serum cholesterol after subtracting the HDL is the non-HDL cholesterol. The concentration of these other components, which may cause atheroma, is known as the non-HDL-C. This is now preferred to LDL-C as a secondary marker as it has been shown to be a better predictor and it is more easily calculated.

== Structure and function ==

With a size ranging from 5 to 17 nm, HDL is the smallest of the lipoprotein particles. It is the densest because it contains the highest proportion of protein to lipids. Its most abundant apolipoproteins are apo A-I and apo A-II. A rare genetic variant, ApoA-1 Milano, has been documented to be far more effective in both protecting against and regressing arterial disease, atherosclerosis.

The liver synthesizes these lipoproteins as complexes of apolipoproteins and phospholipid, which resemble cholesterol-free flattened spherical lipoprotein particles, whose NMR structure was published; the complexes are capable of picking up cholesterol, carried internally, from cells by interaction with the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). A plasma enzyme called lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) converts the free cholesterol into cholesteryl ester (a more hydrophobic form of cholesterol), which is then sequestered into the core of the lipoprotein particle, eventually causing the newly synthesized HDL to assume a spherical shape. HDL particles increase in size as they circulate through the blood and incorporate more cholesterol and phospholipid molecules from cells and other lipoproteins, such as by interaction with the ABCG1 transporter and the phospholipid transport protein (PLTP).

HDL transports cholesterol mostly to the liver or steroidogenic organs such as adrenals, ovary, and testes by both direct and indirect pathways. HDL is removed by HDL receptors such as scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), which mediate the selective uptake of cholesterol from HDL. In humans, probably the most relevant pathway is the indirect one, which is mediated by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). This protein exchanges triglycerides of VLDL against cholesteryl esters of HDL. As the result, VLDLs are processed to LDL, which are removed from the circulation by the LDL receptor pathway. The triglycerides are not stable in HDL, but are degraded by hepatic lipase so that, finally, small HDL particles are left, which restart the uptake of cholesterol from cells.

The cholesterol delivered to the liver is excreted into the bile and, hence, intestine either directly or indirectly after conversion into bile acids. Delivery of HDL cholesterol to adrenals, ovaries, and testes is important for the synthesis of steroid hormones.
Several steps in the metabolism of HDL can participate in the transport of cholesterol from lipid-laden macrophages of atherosclerotic arteries, termed foam cells, to the liver for secretion into the bile. This pathway has been termed &quot;reverse cholesterol transport&quot; and is considered as the classical protective function of HDL toward atherosclerosis.

HDL carries many lipid and protein species, several of which have very low concentrations but are biologically very active. For example, HDL and its protein and lipid constituents help to inhibit oxidation, inflammation, activation of the endothelium, coagulation, and platelet aggregation. All these properties may contribute to the ability of HDL to protect from atherosclerosis, and it is not yet known which are the most important. In addition, a small subfraction of HDL lends protection against the protozoan parasite &quot;Trypanosoma brucei brucei&quot;. This HDL subfraction, termed trypanosome lytic factor (TLF), contains specialized proteins that, while very active, are unique to the TLF molecule.

In the stress response, serum amyloid A, which is one of the acute-phase proteins and an apolipoprotein, is under the stimulation of cytokines (interleukin 1, interleukin 6), and cortisol produced in the adrenal cortex and carried to the damaged tissue incorporated into HDL particles. At the inflammation site, it attracts and activates leukocytes. In chronic inflammations, its deposition in the tissues manifests itself as amyloidosis.

It has been postulated that the concentration of large HDL particles more accurately reflects protective action, as opposed to the concentration of total HDL particles. This ratio of large HDL to total HDL particles varies widely and is measured only by more sophisticated lipoprotein assays using either electrophoresis (the original method developed in the 1970s) or newer NMR spectroscopy methods (See also nuclear magnetic resonance and spectroscopy), developed in the 1990s.

=== Subfractions ===
Five subfractions of HDL have been identified. From largest (and most effective in cholesterol removal) to smallest (and least effective), the types are 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, and 3c.

== Epidemiology ==
Men tend to have noticeably lower HDL concentrations, with smaller size and lower cholesterol content, than women. Men also have a greater incidence of atherosclerotic heart disease. Studies confirm the fact that HDL has a buffering role in balancing the effects of the hypercoagulable state in type 2 diabetics and decreases the high risk of cardiovascular complications in these patients. Also, the results obtained in this study revealed that there was a significant negative correlation between HDL and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT).

Epidemiological studies have shown that high concentrations of HDL (over 60 mg/dL) have protective value against cardiovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. Low concentrations of HDL (below 40 mg/dL for men, below 50 mg/dL for women) increase the risk for atherosclerotic diseases.

Data from the landmark Framingham Heart Study showed that, for a given level of LDL, the risk of heart disease increases 10-fold as the HDL varies from high to low. On the converse, however, for a fixed level of HDL, the risk increases 3-fold as LDL varies from low to high. 

Even people with very low LDL levels achieved by statin treatment are exposed to increased risk if their HDL levels are not high enough.

Very high HDL-C levels (≥80 mg/dL in men, ≥100 mg/dL in women) appears to be detrimental to cardiovascular outcomes. Several genetic conditions cause abnormally low or high HDL-C levels, often without the expected change in cardiovascular disease rates. In fact, when many known correlates of CVD risks are controlled for, HDL-C does not have any correlation with cardiovascular event risks. In this way, HDL-C only seems to serve as an imperfect, but easy-to-measure, proxy for a healthy lifestyle. What does correlate well with CVD risks even when these factors are controlled for is a direct measure of the capability for reverse cholesterol transport in a person&#x27;s blood serum, the &quot;cholesterol efflux capacity&quot; (CEC).

== Estimating HDL via associated cholesterol ==
Clinical laboratories formerly measured HDL cholesterol by separating other lipoprotein fractions using either ultracentrifugation or chemical precipitation with divalent ions such as Mg2+, then coupling the products of a cholesterol oxidase reaction to an indicator reaction. The reference method still uses a combination of these techniques. Most laboratories now use automated homogeneous analytical methods in which lipoproteins containing apo B are blocked using antibodies to apo B, then a colorimetric enzyme reaction measures cholesterol in the non-blocked HDL particles. HPLC can also be used. Subfractions (HDL-2C, HDL-3C) can be measured, but clinical significance of these subfractions has not been determined. The measurement of apo-A reactive capacity can be used to measure HDL cholesterol but is thought to be less accurate.

=== Recommended ranges ===
The American Heart Association, NIH and NCEP provide a set of guidelines for fasting HDL levels and risk for heart disease.
High LDL with low HDL level is an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

== Measuring HDL concentration and sizes ==
As technology has reduced costs and clinical trials have continued to demonstrate the importance of HDL, methods for directly measuring HDL concentrations and size (which indicates function) at lower costs have become more widely available and increasingly regarded as important for assessing individual risk for progressive arterial disease and treatment methods.

=== Electrophoresis measurements ===
Since the HDL particles have a net negative charge and vary by density &amp; size, ultracentrifugation combined with electrophoresis have been utilized since before 1950 to enumerate the concentration of HDL particles and sort them by size with a specific volume of blood plasma. Larger HDL particles are carrying more cholesterol.

=== NMR measurements ===
Concentration and sizes of lipoprotein particles can be estimated using nuclear magnetic resonance fingerprinting.

==== Optimal total and large HDL concentrations ====

The HDL particle concentrations are typically categorized by event rate percentiles based on the people participating and being tracked in the MESA trial, a medical research study sponsored by the United States National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

The lowest incidence of atherosclerotic events over time occurs within those with both the highest concentrations of total HDL particles (the top quarter, &gt;75%) and the highest concentrations of large HDL particles. Multiple additional measures, including LDL particle concentrations, small LDL particle concentrations, VLDL concentrations, estimations of insulin resistance and standard cholesterol lipid measurements (for comparison of the plasma data with the estimation methods discussed above) are routinely provided in clinical testing.

== Increasing HDL levels ==

While higher HDL levels are correlated with lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, no medication used to increase HDL has been proven to improve health. As of 2017, numerous lifestyle changes and drugs to increase HDL levels were under study.

HDL lipoprotein particles that bear apolipoprotein C3 are associated with increased, rather than decreased, risk for coronary heart disease.

=== Diet and exercise ===
Certain changes in diet and exercise may have a positive impact on raising HDL levels:
* Decreased intake of simple carbohydrates.
* Aerobic exercise
* Weight loss
* Avocado consumption
* Magnesium supplements raise HDL-C.
* Addition of soluble fiber to diet
* Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids such as fish oil or flax oil
* Increased intake of unsaturated fats
* Removal of trans fatty acids from the diet

Most saturated fats increase HDL cholesterol to varying degrees but also raise total and LDL cholesterol.

=== Recreational drugs ===
HDL levels can be increased by smoking cessation, or mild to moderate alcohol intake.

Cannabis in unadjusted analyses, past and current cannabis use was not associated with higher HDL-C levels. A study performed in 4635 patients demonstrated no effect on the HDL-C levels (P=0.78) [the mean (standard error) HDL-C values in control subjects (never used), past users and current users were 53.4 (0.4), 53.9 (0.6) and 53.9 (0.7) mg/dL, respectively].

Exogenous anabolic androgenic steroids, particularly 17α-alkylated anabolic steroids and others administered orally, can reduce HDL-C by 50 percent or more. Other androgen receptor agonists such as selective androgen receptor modulators can also lower HDL. As there is some evidence that the HDL reduction is caused by increased reverse cholesterol transport, it is unknown if AR agonists&#x27; HDL-lowering effect is pro- or anti-atherogenic.

=== Pharmaceutical drugs and niacin ===

Pharmacological therapy to increase the level of HDL cholesterol includes use of fibrates and niacin. Fibrates have not been proven to have an effect on overall deaths from all causes, despite their effects on lipids.

Niacin (nicotinic acid, a form of vitamin B3) increases HDL by selectively inhibiting hepatic diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, reducing triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion through a receptor HM74 otherwise known as niacin receptor 2 and HM74A / GPR109A, niacin receptor 1.

Pharmacologic (1- to 3-gram/day) niacin doses increase HDL levels by 10–30%, making it the most powerful agent to increase HDL-cholesterol. A randomized clinical trial demonstrated that treatment with niacin can significantly reduce atherosclerosis progression and cardiovascular events. Niacin products sold as &quot;no-flush&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot; not having side-effects such as &quot;niacin flush&quot;, do not, however, contain free nicotinic acid and are therefore ineffective at raising HDL, while products sold as &quot;sustained-release&quot; may contain free nicotinic acid, but &quot;some brands are hepatotoxic&quot;; therefore the recommended form of niacin for raising HDL is the cheapest, immediate-release preparation. Both fibrates and niacin increase artery toxic homocysteine, an effect that can be counteracted by also consuming a multivitamin with relatively high amounts of the B-vitamins, but multiple European trials of the most popular B-vitamin cocktails, trial showing 30% average reduction in homocysteine, while not showing problems have also not shown any benefit in reducing cardiovascular event rates. A 2011 extended-release niacin (Niaspan) study was halted early because patients adding niacin to their statin treatment showed no increase in heart health, but did experience an increase in the risk of stroke.

In contrast, while the use of statins is effective against high levels of LDL cholesterol, most have little or no effect in raising HDL cholesterol. Rosuvastatin and pitavastatin, however, have been demonstrated to significantly raise HDL levels.

Lovaza has been shown to increase HDL-C. However, the best evidence to date suggests it has no benefit for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

The PPAR modulator GW501516 has shown a positive effect on HDL-C and an antiatherogenic where LDL is an issue. However, research on the drug has been discontinued after it was discovered to cause rapid cancer development in several organs in rats.
